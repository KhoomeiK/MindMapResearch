I have been journaling for decades, inconsistently, and it's an incredibly illuminating experience to see the self in a non-depressed mode when experiencing depression, as well as to see the logic of depression during a period of remission. Sometimes you can even see glaring inconsistent ideas, and identify your own personal self defeating psychological mechanisms."

I just have multiple versions of my own voice espousing a mixture of self hatred, encouragement, and self pity. This is of course mixed with other ppls comments that sometimes stay in my head for years.

I have a sort of mythological way to understand my mental health issues regarding this self talk. I sometimes imagine it's a separate being, perhaps stuck or somehow tortured. I also write and have performed slam poetry (spoken word), but I have barely ever really tried to write...I will be sort of possessed by an onslaught of words until it just stops. The majority of my writing I consider acceptable comes directly from these periods of inspiration. So I see the 'other' inside me as a being in torment, that sometimes is able to create these poems in a frenzy. It allows me to 1. Separate myself from that part of me that hates me, and 2. Have a certain amount of gratitude for the inner torment, as it is simply the destructive side of that being/ energy. 

It helps me accept my situation more. This is significant being a suicide survivor, and having several diagnoses over a couple decades. 

Anyway, sorry I was just really touched by your post, and wanted to share my experience. I've read a lot and talked to a lot of ppl regarding mental health- patients and professional s, and your story is the first of it's kind I've heard/ read."
cripplingalcoholism,fk07c5b,t3_ffaodp,1583745357.0,"This sub used to be pretty hardcore...maybe 8 years ago, I'm not exactly sure. Mouthwash, vanilla extract, and cooking Sherry were common reccomendation c.a.s that didn't get to the store in time, were using food stamps/ ebt, or shoplifting...all were fairly common back then. 

Anyway, mouthwash has alcohol in it, and to prevent dts, I've def drank a couple bottles. It's have the trees open their six foot mouths and scream Sonic waves into your psyche while shaking and twitching, or not have a terrible night. Back when I was not far from leaving Las Vegas level, not keeping a BAC constantly was out of the question. 

I did order a couple bottles from Amazon a couple years back ( actually to be used as mouthwash) that had Russian labels, like Listerine brand, but Russian. Anyway, I don't drink anything like I used to but one night I was pretty tense and out of beer/ wine, so I went for it....I dunno if they add something to the stuff or what, but there was no drinking that shit.....and I was an aristocrat/ spacebag/211 drunk for a few years. 
Interesting fact though, they sell phenobarbital otc in a low dose suspension. I would assume both those things (mouthwash and barbiturates) are directly related to the high rates of alcoholics there.

TL;DR
Don't drink Russian mouthwash. But pick me up some korvalol."

AskReddit,fij3w4t,t3_f7yk11,1582434074.0,"So...it was actually an email. After my mom passed (I was in rehab, and of course left to see her in the hospital but hadn't checked my email for months) I was rereading all the emails that I never appreciated before. All the positive, and motivational comments I took for granted before and now think about regularly suddenly meant so much. That's the first part, specifically the reference to ""carry the fire"" because we both really loved Cormac McCarthy and 'The Road' was specifically important since she was a single parent and life got a bit rough at a few points. We definitely both read that book through the same lens so to speak.

But one of the last ones she sent looked like a drunk text or something and I didn't really understand because she wasn't sick with anything that affected cognition (until the last few days) and she definitely didn't drink and would maybe take a half dose of pain meds occasionally. Maybe to make a point and show her drug addict son that depression isn't a reason to do heroin every day for 10 years, since she knew she was sick and was def in physical pain. Well, yeah she was right..that was like 6 years ago and I still have depression, don't do heroin, and have significantly less problems than before, who knew? Everyone but me obviously.

So I kinda wrote off the email with it's misspelled half words and strange reference to a blue bag with some nonspecific documents. 

A week or two later my brother and I were cleaning out her storage unit and there's this blue bag...I didn't even think about the email until maybe hours or days later but, well there was a significant amount of, let's call it informal life insurance. I don't think me or my bro had ever seen anything like it. 

There wasn't anything illegal going on, so the best theory I have is that she knew I would be almost non-functional, and my brother was younger and didn't really have much life experience , and after being the executor for her gma who raised her, she wanted to make the financial aspect of her passing as easy as possible. And yeah, I was an addict, but i would go cold turkey and sweat and hallucinate before stealing from my mom or brother, i did it multiple times. Plus I always considered that her money. Like shes still taking care of us. Well she is. The crazy thing is she sent it very soon before she was taken to the hospital...maybe a day, maybe less. So while her brain was filling up with chemicals (ammonia? something like that, the Dr was there and speaking, but that's all I remember) and she was losing cognitive function, she sent me an email to ensure we found what she had left for us. 

Her birthday is coming up soon, and it's a time of the year I always start to feel better, become more functional, regardless of the previous few months. I have to, I mean, I carry the fire. 

Thanks Reddit & OP....I haven't thought about that for a long time...and I needed to remember that, the last two months... well I needed to remember."

mentalhealth,fc8ypc4,t1_fc5x6qs,1577544233.0,"Hah! That was more of a joke bc of my fascination with and subsequent obsessive self directed study of...well everything. 
But the truth is that we do know it takes about 25 years for the human brain to completely develop...we also know, the more or less tactile and environmental stimulus a child (specifically younger) recieves can positively stimulate learning/ adaptive behavior or prohibit the same. (the post Soviet collapse and the studies done on Romanian orphans that increased in size and overflowed the infrastructure have a great deal of insight in this area, ie orphans didn't get the attention/ love/ stimulus that a 'average' person may get and have disproportionate amounts of homeless drug addicted youth with short life spans). 

We also know that mental health issues or behavior maladaptations in the developing human don't just turn on...they may turn on once, then again a little later, and unfortunately, without social support and with a select gene distribution this can turn into a lifelong mood disorder. 

So...it seems to me, that if we are mapping our brains to recognize disturbing things, even becoming fond of them (gore/ IMHO porn, etc) this is counterintuitive to allowing the human to maybe develop in a dynamically challenging environment that would hypothetically allow max potential to be reached. 

There's nothing that's going to convince me that movies/ games/ etc, with war/ violence/ the destruction of the human body as entertainment or a normalized theme can possibly benefit more than perhaps a small portion of the exposed population. ...some people do release tension and perhaps antisocial tendencies this way. 

So...for me, I have intrusive thoughts, a terrible case of cannot unsee...still stuff in my head from over 20 years ago. So I've come to associate regular objects with terrible things...for instance I always see something in the mirror before I even look into it. Without detail, the protagonist looked at themselves in the mirror and it wasnt pretty..so my brain made an adaptation and I had to avoid or prepare myself to approach mirrors for a long time... still do, just not as often. 

Less disturbing, I learned to pick up on some types of misdirected hostility from the tone of voice and word choice people use in the heat of the moment. This has diffused countless altercations...and it's bc I grew up with multiple types of crazy and learned to deal with emotional breakdowns, outbursts, etc....and eventually started reading the warning signs like a weather report. 

So...yeh, basically the experiences we have, thoughts we have, physical movement, all create some record in our neurophysiology. And repeated or significant phenomenon writes a permanent record that is very hard to override later in life."

Social Anxiety may be completely irrational, completely valid, or, most likely, somewhere between the two.

I used have opinions that teachers would sometimes be looking for, so I noticed in school that ppl would look at me, expecting me to rattle off some pseudoacademic aggregate of whatever I thought I knew, and for a preemptive self defense would layer it in pretentious semi-nihilistic armor, so as to keep anyone from being able to respond completely in any oppositional way. 

Taking myself emotionally out of the equation, and accepting that I was not and didn't want to be accepted by people who had no interest in ... anything really....allowed me very brief moments where my acute social awareness, empathic nature (hypersensitivity), and idealistic philosophical beliefs (compassion, scientific curiousity, and conviction, could all be very potent skills that have a great value to the species.

depression,f8epyla,t1_f8di90e,1574531810.0,"Yeah...I kinda have mixed feelings about the music specifically..I was wearing a lot of dark clothes and boots before puberty but never went further than that and band shirts as far as the culture/fashion/whatever...but there's some kind of exonerating feeling to seeing an artist (I'm thinking recent hip hop emo trap type stuff) being not only accepted but liked/ loved when they are very explicit about mental health issues...I got full soda cans thrown at my head, slammed into walls, couldn't tell you the number of times I was called faget, but multiple times a week (I was also in hs during Columbine) and I didn't present an outrageously rebellious image, I just had no friends, etc..(honestly I feel I was semi 'catatonic' or something.. ..so, I dropped out, did drugs and embraced everything from three six mafia to mayhem, because it was all I understood...but it was never ok, accepted, etc....and I've been told my whole life I'm hard to be around, as if I hadn't lived with myself longer than anyone...so yeah, not much self esteem/image/worth...so there's a freedom, especially after so long, of feeling like it's ok to be me....but then ppl emulate it, either for acceptance or profit (and I think I have a pretty good grasp on determining if someone has had similar experiences or they are just creating an exxagerated narrative...like, oh you wake up/ fall asleep crying also? What's your hydration routine? ...Anyone who has knows the post dehydration and accompanying headache and facial pain from the muscles tensing is a bitch)...but honestly I think people who create an image are honestly not really intelligent enough to understand what they're doing....and maybe not even have the emotional depth or imagination to even glimpse some aspects of the life they think is cool...it reminds me of suburban kids listening to hardcore rap and thinking it's cool to live in the 'hood'...I also grew up in section 8 housing, so I always saw that ideology through a humourous lens, but yeh...public housing was just the beginning of my life but MDD, etc, seems to have become my life. Anyway...I doubt I made a point but....well thx for letting me try to. I guess I gave up on being understood a long time ago, so maybe I just wanna vicariously experience being cool, even if it's for the same issues that have consistently crushed me, day after day."
mentalhealth,f8drw2c,t3_e0dia4,1574507175.0,"Reality testing was the best non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention I've received...still use it, even if it's as simple as a pros vs cons list...but it was originally targeted at core beliefs that were pretty negative...

also journaling, anything really, creative material is sometimes as illuminating as purposeful introspection. 
 I will write thoughts/ beliefs sometimes, sometimes rant, and sometimes analyze myself from an outsider perspective...patient has been more willing to socialize in the past 2 weeks and from self reports/  observation it it likely the interest in stoicism, which the patient reports has caused them to begin developing a 'list of personal values' that could potentially supercede emotionally triggered apathy and periods of despair, has reduced the intrapsychic activity in response to perceived rejection that has historically preceded self destructive behavior. Patient now displays a greater degree of control on behavior during outbursts of rage, and the onset of depression. (Actual entry)

Recently, I have been reading a lot of different perspectives on Western mental health and also philosophy. 

It's important to know all viewpoints of an issue to make an informed decision and integrate that into your idea of yourself and behavior. This is probably apparent to most but I considered p-docs completely competent, compassionate, etc. Then after decades I saw over 10 in each Field (psychiatry, clinical psychologist, counlselors of all types) and also have seen about 100, maybe more medical professionals in the last 5 years. To add to the dissillusionment that seemed to grow as my # of interactions did, I have friends studying at grad level that are less knowledgeable about some of the established ideas in psychology than I am...(I just read a lot, and that was a early interest), and have glaring discriminatory beliefs about some of their patients, future patients...even implying certain people are faking it to get government drugs and money...and I am quite hypersensitive but I am fairly certain I am included in this list...but I haven't seen a Dr in years (Medicare and substance abuse history both make it hard to find a pdoc that will even listen) and I survived an incomplete suicide 5 years ago. And I don't believe in comparing pain for any non diagnostic reason, but when someone implies they experience the same lows i do, but are constantly involved in hobbies, have a social life, spend an hour or two a day in the bathroom on, I'm not exactly sure what, but definitely motivated by vanity and are as functional/ responsible as the 'average' person, and claims to experience daily outbursts of crying and suicidal idealogy, without any meds or therapy...I find it hard to believe their claims...anyone with the crying issue  (that I've talked to) knows the post session dehydration and headache are sometimes the worst parts. And, I don't talk about suicidal thoughts/ my personal problems, unless I'm asked or accused. I never claim to want to die to avoid dealing with life, but only relate my lack of visible options makes this idea pretty attractive. 

Theres no absolute truth...but for me, I have to continue to develop my understanding of reality, independent of any one school of thought.

Noone is completely right or wrong unless their ideas have been quantified, emperically measured, statistically analyzed, and peer reviewer...but as an inspiring character from my adolescence would die believing...the truth is out there...and it's often comparable to others however never the same. 
 
There's definitely an interplay between personal psychology/ idealogy, and and neurologic or genetic issues that exist. It's just pretty hard to find that line...like how much can you 'force' yourself to do something, and how many times do you actually just need to be alone for a while, and rest. Regardless, these are personal conclusions. Other forms of therapy promote talking things out, which helps as well, but the decision has to be ours, to maintain a level of accountability. 

I prob talked way too much about myself, but I know what it's like to have mixed messages coming from everywhere, and have had to deal with that as well as what I believed was misdiagnosis or treatment modalities that seemed counterintuitive....and having a good relationship with a Dr. Is literally the best defense against the confusion that will drive you mad otherwise. I wish you luck friend. Take care.

Last thought, really, I promise..... evolutionary medicine/ darwininian medicine has some ideas that align with or are in the same boat as some reasons I've come to believe are causal factors in most mental health issues."

My point is, is that the serious mental health issues presenting in the population seemed to have increased by so much, it's overwhelming. Obviously, there are a number of factors that would seem to indicate this regardless of validity....but we're getting statistics back as well. Sometimes all I can do is what I have to to survive...other times I may spend an hour responding (almost exclusively) in depression/ depression help/ mental health. ....and I'm just a person who's lived with multigenerational mental illness for a few decades, and happens to read a lot. 

I don't even think we currently have the infrastructure for the treatment of as many humans that are significantly distressed. This was/ maybe is still a serious issue in, I believe rural Australia and New Zealand...admitted by the governments, internationally reported.

I don't want to give you any advice on what the treatment is for antisocial/ violent/ destructive behavior, because I don't know your age/ country, and have never dealt with that personally. While what you described doesn't sound atrocious from my cultural perspective and limited knowledge of the situation, (maybe just mean, you didn't really go into details about the animals, so I'm not sure), different types of professionals react differently depending on their function and perspective, so I really can't say. I do know that if you are considered a danger to yourself or others, there are situations where someone would find it nessasary to commit you to an institution...however this is on the more severe end...and that may not even come up. 

The best case scenario I can imagine is a treatment plan and psychological monitoring....so yeh maybe meds, group and individual therapy... usually, from what I've seen, someone in your situation comes into a therapeutic situation after being 'caught' or getting in trouble for hurting someone/ something. 

I suppose I should say that if you do feel like you are going to hurt someone or something, including yourself, you have a responsibility to reveal this to someone who can intervene. 

I have had intrusive thoughts my whole life...to the point of tactile hallucinations. They have almost completely gone away now, but they used to be very disturbing scenes....every once in a while if I get into a rage, they will re-emerge against someone else. I know this is when I am unstable, and need to check in with someone. 

What I really can't answer is anything about crossing the line from fantasy to reality. I'm sorry about that, but it sounds like you want help regardless, which is a step ahead of the people brought in after committing some terrible act.

The only reason I'm responding this early in the morning (for me) is I saw the age and the statement of trying everything. Go through my comment history, it will  verify my experience, unless of course I am sociopathic and have invented a complex alter-ego....I assure you I'm not that smart. I am almost 40 and permanently disabled from an incomplete suicide, I would say first serious attempt, however several naive attempts exceeding 10 or so. (My current perception of this is a bad leg, but I started in a wheelchair so it was pretty serious, this is a good example of directing your internal self talk or thoughts, as when I'm having a bad day I think of myself as a gimp, or something incredibly negative). I am also treatment resistant at this point and I have enough scars that it's impossible to hide. 

You haven't tried everything. It's just logically impossible, not a personal criticism of your judgement. When I was in your position, self harm was just being integrated into treatment modalities, depression had fairly recently been fully recognized, however the general consensus was that it was a phase. 

It is critical to your survival and success in any form as a human being within society to remember a few things....

Developing your own value system and being able to realize when others are impeding your progress or oppressing you, regardless of intent, is very helpful in being able to take action to help yourself. This includes your parents. Consider the guilt/shame/anger (I'm not sure of the reaction you wish to avoid) of having a child with the issues you have now, versus the reaction to what may develop in 1-10 years. 

Drugs have kept me alive since I was 14. I don't differentiate between prescription antidepressants and illegal street drugs in this case. That being said, weed, especially if you don't know the cannabinoid distribution in the strain you're using, or even the strain, can be psychosis inducing for some individuals. I have had strains that kept me hiding in the bathroom all night to strains that kept depressive ideas/ feelings away almost completely. I have never personally been able to complete acedemic or intellectual pursuits at my full potential with any of them. You are not weak or wrong for trying to help yourself, however, being misinformed or ignorant (the literal definition) of the methods you choose can lead to a counterproductive result.

A lot of people feel defective, hopeless, etc. because they can't just be happy and normal like everyone else. This is a complete misunderstanding of reality. Happiness is not a state of being, through a series of cultural changes this has become a common misconception. What you should aim to achieve is contentment and calm, and ideally moments, hours, or even days of joy and happiness will manifest as a result of you finding things you enjoy. 

I also believe that it's important to realize that you're not nessasarily (Ive never been able to spell that word)  wrong if you're having negative thoughts, however they may be exaggerated immensely. The world has a lot of terrible things, all humans have shortcomings, etc. If specific ideas about yourself or your environment seem to consistently reappear, perhaps the attempt to change those things will be where you find inspiration. For example, I hated society immensely for the inconsistent rules, social and legal, the lack of compassion and concern I saw as the status quo, and the disregard for the rights of others, up to and including genocide. This became the reason I got out of bed in the morning, went to school, went to work, etc. That driving force was the other thing I needed to keep me alive. I may have never accomplished anything 'distinguished' but have been involved in helping a lot of people directly, as well as larger social movements. 

Consult professionals: clinical psychologists, maybe psychiatrists, adults who you value their opinion. Don't take everything they say as absolute truth, but this is a start in understanding your experience. Most of the peers you consult with will be confused, developing humans that don't really know much, and are concerned with the image they project more than truth. Most, not all. 

Research and reflect on all possible treatment modalities:. From weed to antidepressants to CBT. Making an uninformed decision is not actually a decision at all, but an impulsive reactionary behavior. 

Write everything down.... thoughts, feelings, experiences,  every week or so go back over the previous entries and look for patterns, inconsistencies, etc. Am I getting better? Worse? Did what I write on Tuesday last month even make sense? Do I agree with what I wrote? Trust me this is incredibly illuminating and will help determine the strengths and limitation of perception and self analysis.  

Try some philosophy out.. Alan Watts and Marcus Aurelius have taught me a lot, but this is a very personal thing. Just be wary of Nihilism and to some extent Existentialism, as these can potentially be detrimental. 

Take care."
mentalhealth,f405ncu,t3_diyehy,1571285877.0,"To qualify, I have Major Depression and Borderline Personality, couple decades...the past few years I have been treatment resistant, and because of my situation I have two or three friends left, either ppl couldn't handle me anymore/ were sensitive to my emotions, or their abrasive qualities became unbearable for me. 

The fact is, I can get overwhelmed with someone else's depression, and theoretically it should be therapeutic to relate in to someone in a similar situation.

As well, before my symptoms were deemed untreatable, I had a lot of friends in various levels and fields of psychology, social work, counseling, etc. One of the few left is in grad school now. 

Also, my career goal was to work in post conflict zones, helping develop programs to transform/mitigate any residual/ transgenerational conflict/ trauma. 

Self care is emphasized for anyone dealing with other human beings experiencing chronic negative emotions, financial instability, war, medical issues, etc. This includes therapy, personal social time, personal time, religion/ spirituality if youre into that, did I mention therapy, and coming to an understanding (which is way beyond my ability to conceptualize) that you can only do so much. For a professional this would be clinical detachment, however that term is inappropriate for your situation, I merely mention it to illustrate the concept. Perhaps compartmentalization, or boundaries is better. As either a spouse, close friend, or family member, unfortunately the issue belongs, to some extent, to everyone involved. There is a wide range of reactions to this type of situation, and unfortunately many people underestimate the potential consequences of not seeking help for themselves."
depression,f403jkq,t3_diq1jv,1571283946.0,"I'm not going to go into my story, except to say it's similar to yours...I needed stiches on my leg, and my great-grandmother taught me how to sew, so yeah, I made it through one gash then broke out the gorilla tape. 

What I really wanted to say is that I found 4 very effective ways to prohibit the anxiety, or arrest the attack.

Obviously, benzos to arrest and oddly naltrexone to prohibit. This second chemical surprised me immensely and also helped with overeating, intrusive thoughts, and helped me stay more mentally grounded...this may be popular and we'll know now, but 7-8 years ago was when it was prescribed for me. 

At some point, I discovered weightlifting...and the interesting thing is, I was a 'cutter' at the end, and when the skin is damaged by a tear (it's really a tear unless you're a surgeon) the healing process is facilitated by collegen, which forms the scar. Weightlifting is a similar process, creating small tears in the muscle, which are later filled in. Also, there's something calming and satisfying about DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). I'm not sure if this is universal, or specific to someone who connects some forms of physical pain with psychological relief. I know all mental health websites and practitioners encourage exercise, but this similarity between lifting and 'cutting' was fairly interesting to me, and while perhaps psychosomatic, the theory was motivating and I learned a lot about lifting. Most people at the gym are trying to shape their body to look a certain way or for an array of health reasons, I have met a significant number of 'gym-rats', who if you get to know them, are lifting because they don't want to kill themselves or someone else. 

I love hot showers, but at some point, (in a mental facility) I realized that hot showers that were a little too hot, with a very slow increase in temperature would have an incredibly calming effect on panic/ anxiety/ intense suicidal ideation  (which was my trigger). This experience was maybe a few years after I had my last episode with self harm, but I was thinking about it a lot, as well as multiple other terrible things.

It's important to acknowledge that I am fairly hesitant about posting this last finding as someone who engages in self harm for other reasons may not be able to moderate the whole shower experience...but there has to be others that have similar triggers as I did. 

Also....it's 2019? So....I guess I haven't engaged in physical self harm in 12 years? I think that's right. 

As far as the shame...if you ever get a chance to relate to someone, maybe younger, more confused, by simply showing them your scars... there is a good chance you may feel differently. I hope. All we can do is look for each other....in hospitals....the workplace...and offer what we can, because the p-docs and pills and 'normal' friends can only help so much. Many cultures, most of them transformed (modernized) now, used various methods of scarification and body modification to indicate a life stage (rites of passage), tribal membership, etc. We are of the same tribe friend."

gmu,f3dmrpv,t1_f3agf49,1570841097.0,"Yeah, it was a (perhaps weak attempt at a) joke. The definition already given is spot on. Personally, I don't think there is any scientific or logical method to determine the validity of anything supernatural, and while there is a good deal of essentially circumstantial evidence to suggest that religion has no validity in it's claims about death, creation, etc., there is no way to completely disprove it. My personal answer to the question of religious validity is essentially what I just said,  abbreviated as ""I really don't know"". This ""I don't know"" stance is my understanding of agnosticism. So, ""I don't know, change my mind"", could be interpreted as ""change my ignorance to your belief"", but for me it is a ..sort of non-sequitor, or just a ridiculous thing to say because taken literally it is not possible to change a belief that doesn't exist, only to manifest one where none exists. So..it's funny right....ha.."

Honestly, your symptoms sound like depression...I have treatment resistant major depression, and that's one phase of my personal experience with it, but then I cycle through all kinds of other phases.

One of my best friends has the exact same thing as you're describing as well. He was pretty 1337 @ starcraft (back in the day) and is very smart but admits that he just doesn't wanna do anything he doesn't absolutely have to, and when probed further he says he cant pay attention or process the information. 

You mentioned school and parents...so I'm assuming you're HS or College? 

  
I would maybe talk to a clinical psychologist....maybe something is bothering you more than you think. 

Also if you have a GP, maybe get their opinion and perhaps a referral to a neurologist. Especially if you've had anything out of the ordinary happen that could effect cognition. (I had a stroke, but it could be more subtle), ie other symptoms like microsleep or something you don't realize. 

I was already seeing a psychiatrist when my severe fatigue and cognition issues began (I played RTS, also back in the day, tried recently, my head was laying on the desk and i was only using the mouse, and just wandering units around, lasted 10 minutes). 

But anyway, the first possibility was a worsening of depression, then I had several sleep studies to determine sleep apnea, next im supposed to have a daytime test for narcolepsy. 

In addition, what i've found and been told could be to blame (aside from the previously mentioned)

\-Low Testosterone

Thyroid Disfunction

Chronic Lime Disease

And a fairly significant list beyond that, which if all else fails, the diagnosis is ideopathic hypersomnia. 

Not trying to freak you out, just to show that the causes of what youre describing can be easy to fix with lifestyle change, or Vitamin D, or huge problems you prob dont have, but its always better to find out sooner than later. 

The main thing is, it's not laziness if you're avoiding the activities because they are intellectually overwhelming or you cant pay attention. It sounds like you want to game but you avoid that because of the mental thing. 

That being said, you could always rule laziness out by forcing yourself to do everything you can for a week, see how you respond. I'm a strong proponent of keeping it scientific, recording specific reactions, thoughts, time of day, monitor your diet, sleeping patterns, moods, etc. This will help any medical professional as well. Humans are not very accurate with self reporting, but if you write it down, it'll greatly increase the accuracy, and bypass any polarized perception. Naming the entire phenomenon laziness is sort of a polarized, or incomplete, and potentially inaccurate way of understanding and expressing the experience. I told doctors I was tired for two years and then realized I was being incredibly naive and not really explaining my symptoms, like they would just figure it out. 

You said literally everything, I feel this way as well, but when I'm hungry I go into autopilot, i'm still zombified, but I don't have problems thinking when cooking food. This exception could mean something, so it's important to be as accurate as possible. 

Anyway, not a doctor, just been all kinds of sick, and read a lot. I doubt it's anything serious, but to avoid considering serious causal factors is irresponsible, especially for me as someone giving advice.

Also, you didn't mention how long this has lasted. That's important info. Keep a journal, see some doctors, if you really monitor your life like you were studying an alien or something, and talk to medical professionals (second opinions if possible, Doctors are not all created equal), it's very likely a cause and subsequent solution will be found."

depressionregimens,f32bzqt,t3_df5bme,1570601520.0,"Wellbutrin can cause me to hallucinate, paranoia, etc, but for me SSRIs never had any adverse reaction like that. And you seem to be experiencing the opposite?

They work pretty differently. Not a Dr...just been prescribed a good deal of the pharmacy, and most of my friends have also.

The symptoms you're describing are typically side effects of antipsychotics, whereas Wellbutrin seems to cause agitation. Are you taking a benzo for anxiety? That can cause problems....

Anyway, as far as whether you should go back on an SSRI,  that's a pretty personal decision based on how comfortable you are with current circumstances versus how uncomfortable you are with meds in general. I personally think SSRIs are fine, and I've never experienced withdrawal from any antidepressants or antipsychotics, and I've been on max doses of SSRIs and a fairly large amount of antipsychotics. 

Maybe there's something else going on with you? It's easy for us and providers to blame everything on depression or meds, cause it's such a weird experience that encompasses a lot, but don't rule out other causal factors. 

I dunno your circumstances, how long you can continue your leave of absence, but sometimes we just need rest. That's hard for me bc of the self judgement, and internal criticism, but maybe just try it. Might help the decision making process also."
