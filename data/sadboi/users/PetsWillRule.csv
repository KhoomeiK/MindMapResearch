mentalillness,fpqc9yd,t3_ge2r6g,1588819604.0,right so BPD is a hard subject with the intense feelings and emotions and sometimes mood swings yeah it's hard although she might attack you it's just emotions there strong really strong and often hard to control if you were to look into my mind with my BPD it's a mess and with depression yeah it creates a deadly mix it is hard to keep in there with those 2 things keeping at you it's like a hurricane is in your head and the emotions are everywhere it's hard to control them there a sea of destruction it is best for her to get help though just think of her emotions like this when you feel a emotion think of that emotion but double it I know it's hard to live with that it is draining but stay in there but she does need help to keep those emotions in check
