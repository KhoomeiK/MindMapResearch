askastronomy,ff2n3mu,t3_er7poe,1579514247.0,"I think it would be impossible because a Blazar is a galaxy's supermassive blackhole's radiation pointing directly at the Earth, and this radiation is perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the entire galaxy (i think because the rotation of the blackhole slightly stretches it so that there is technically more mass at the ""equator"" of the blackhole, pulling the orbiting objects so that they are orbiting in the same relative axis as the ""equator"", same reason why Saturn's rings aren't just orbiting randomly). So assuming that we are orbiting in the main relative axis as the rest of the galaxy, we would never be in the path of the Blazar because we would never be perpendicular to the a is of rotation of the blackhole. I couldn't say if Earth would be okay or not if we theoretically were within a Blazar, sorry

And also using a phone doesnt mean that it makes you depressed and for many people (including myself and most of my friends) it is a way of conversing with friends, family, and sometimes even a therapist. For me it has helped with suicidal thoughts and anxiety attacks, being able to talk to someone that comforts you at any time is amazing and really helps, phones and technology almost always never causes depression and can even make people more social"
