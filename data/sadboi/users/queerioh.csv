AskReddit,fpjt03d,t3_gdn8w2,1588680143.0,"""Do as I say, not as I do.""

No. Fuck that. Be a good example for your kids. Don't blatantly fuck up and tell them to listen rather than imitate. That's not how kids work and you swiftly lose credibility as a ""good person"" in your kids eyes if you intentionally do wrong, then tell your kids its because adults are allowed to. I'm talking things like hitting women (my stepdad), regular theft (from stores and family members, sometimes recruiting by little brother and I for help with the crimes), and other extreme things. He'd do this shit and then when my brother or I would call him out (we rarely did, he's scary) he'd throw that line at us. ""Do as I say, not as I do."" Followed usually by something about how he was our master, not our mentor and we should be obeying him, not copying his actions. There was always an air of superiority to his tone when he'd say this. I learned real young what hypocrisy is.

Other behaviors of his I'd never adopt:

* Put drugs before essential bills like rent
* Abuse my kids after I pressure them to tell me the truth about something, insisting they trust me
* Locker room talk/ask for drugs
* Lock my kids in a room for a weekend and go on a meth binge
* Run away from home leaving only the kids there alone for a few days without food
* Threatening suicide/homicide anytime I feel abandoned or betrayed
* Deal heroin and meth from the same hotel room/apartment/trailer my kids are in at any point of day, while they're home

Funny thing is, I never thought I had a bad childhood. Not until around junior high did I even realize I'd experienced any trauma at all. My stepdad and mom had everything sugarcoated and hidden from us that was too scary and the things we did see were normal for the neighborhood we lived in."

There's a program in AZ through Borderlands Food Bank called [P.O.W.W.O.W. (Produce on Wheels Without Waste)](http://www.borderlandsproducerescue.org/produce-on-wheels/). They give out 70+ pounds of produce for $12 once a week at a bunch of different locations around the valley. I went last Saturday and picked up a full box of tomatoes, a full box of grapefruits, 12 cucumbers, bell peppers, 2 different kinds of zucchini, eggplants and 6 plastic grocery bags full of fresh green beans. More than 70 pounds of food--enough for my family and my boyfriend's parents and their friends to all have some. Pretty frequently, you get more than the promised 70 pounds because they're just trying to make sure it doesn't get wasted. If you can find people to split the cost with, the $12 isn't bad at all. If you need someone to split the cost with or want to share produce when I go pick up next, DM me and we can talk!

FondantHate,f5tzo0d,t1_f2p8qqc,1572466522.0,It exists now but I regret making it as I know nothing about being a mod and just realized I can't delete it. CAN SOMEONE TAKE IT? r/sexycakes
shittyfoodporn,f55qio8,t3_dmt92h,1572012045.0,This is genius. Make every single comfort food a finger food.

BUT I absolutely prefer the shorter style on you. Your bone structure, your eyes, everything about you works so perfectly well with a shorter cut. You’ve got the kind of gorgeous face that any hair would suit, but deeefinitely the short hair on this one. It’s so much bolder and louder and also still so damn pretty."

I might be going against the grain, but I love the contrast the dark color gives to your pretty light eyes. If I had your hair and HAD to pick something to change, all I'd add is some more curl/wave to the body and richer tones/glaze over the brown."
