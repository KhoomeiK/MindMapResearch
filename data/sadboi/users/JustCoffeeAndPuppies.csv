LifeAfterNarcissism,fpw8rdq,t3_gfms99,1588959197.0,It did help to affirm that I made the right decision to leave him. In fact his affair was the reason I gave for divorcing him when deep down it was his covert narcissism that made me want to leave him although I didn’t even realize it at the time. Of course he denied the affair and in true form accused me of having an affair ( with my married friend who was dying of cancer no less.) Projection anyone?!!  So yes I felt empowered when I got confirmation of his affair after the divorce because he denied it so vehemently and made me doubt myself.
ChronicPain,fpmjbin,t3_ge2ryx,1588734324.0,I feel this so hard
CPTSD,flb6wf3,t1_fl9a1eq,1584998607.0,I feel so invalidated when people judge me because they think I should be able to just “get over it” when they have no clue.
mentalhealth,flb5643,t3_fn5kzn,1584997603.0,Good for you!!! It is always a long road but well worth the life you can enjoy when you’re free of that chain. Be good to yourself above all.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fk45jxi,t3_fg0l8t,1583853754.0,"I hear you and I can identify with this feeling as I have kids with my Nex. Divorcing a narc when you have kids together is altogether a different beast which can make you feel like you never get away from them. After the divorce they just use your love for and desire to protect your kids as a weapon against you. It is your ultimate vulnerability and they know it and use it to their advantage to abuse you further. That said, I know it can be easier to deal with if your take advantage of all the tools available ( grey rock, etc) to best manage through  or around this and fill your life with people and passions and love for yourself that make that narc the dimmest part of your daily life. You are enough and you matter!"
UnsentLetters,fjsl4ov,t3_feq6xw,1583598132.0,"What a horrible trauma you have suffered, not only the brutal rape but in the aftermath with the complete lack of human care and concern for helping you heal and process both the physical and emotional damage. I can only imagine how alone you might feel as a result and how pervasive the impact on all areas of your life. I hope you have found a way to work thru some of the pain and have a support system that is there for you now. I highly recommend EMDR therapy if you feel you are “locked” in the trauma and haven’t processed it. Highly effective. 

Virtual hug to you💕and may the hellhounds come and rip your rapist to shreds on his way to hell😊"
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fjpcqrw,t3_feczyt,1583547459.0,"Asking a narc to comply with any sort of boundaries, even if legal in nature, is a problem for them. They want to be able to lie about their financial situation which is harder to do when they are required to provide documentation that a lawyer can use to determine facts. Remember... facts are inconvenient for these tricksters!!! Also mine would drag his feet to drive up my legal fees and get me to give up since the legal fees to fight were much more than what I might gain by pushing it. At the end of the day it’s just another tactic to wear you down so you just give them what they feel entitled to anyway."
aww,fj7plrs,t3_fbky3n,1583095500.0,My heart melts!!
NarcissisticAbuse,fj19izz,t3_farx31,1582915446.0,I’ll never forget the smile on my Narcs face and how he laughed and hooked his arm around my neck to pull me close to savor his “win” at my expense after a failed mediation session for custody of the children. I was so shocked at his absolute glee because I didn’t understand him or what NPD abuse was back then.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,feiwdwz,t3_epaty6,1579149031.0,"My greatest fear is that my children will never see they their NEX dad. I divorced my covert and very “crafty” narc when our boys were 4 and my NEX kept me in constant fear that he was going to take the boys away but in reality all he ever took me to court for was to get out of child support. He was the typical Disneyland dad and so charming and fun whereas I was the real parent with all the responsibility to take care of the boys physically, emotionally and financially. Over the years I just got so drained from the constant abuse and now I’m very depressed and suicidal. The boys are 21 and I’m pretty sure they don’t see thru him at all and just think “I’m too sensitive.” They won’t talk to me about any of it and NEX would not allow me to take boys to therapy when they were younger but I know he was working on them constantly to “win them” and paint me as a controlling vindictive person who was just angry he had an affair (little does he know I was thrilled he had an affair because I now had a “valid” reason to divorce him to others who wouldn’t believe me that he was abusive.) Anyway I’m rambling now so I’ll just close by sharing that my heart is broken because I feel like there is a wall between me and my boys because of  their dads influence and he’s much too smart to take off the mask with them and I am just a broken mess."
depression_help,f82twjp,t3_dynl3z,1574198130.0,I have found that people might try to be there for you but their ability to really listen only goes so far.  Not because they don’t care but because they don’t know what to do to make you feel better.  I try going on apps/blogs like “The Mighty”  much more reliable for support because folks there know what your pain feels like and can empathize. Sending positive vibes your way. You do matter!!
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f35l9ck,t1_f34hj48,1570681087.0,Abuse gets worse after the divorce when you have kids with a narcissist. At least that’s what happened to me. Hope your situation is different.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,exzzt8u,t1_exzhy7p,1566672486.0,It is not silly to get some support and validation from folks who “get it” and most people who aren’t in our situation cannot really ever get it. It’s too foreign from normal!!! And I’m here if ever need to talk although I warn you I’m just starting to figure out how to use Reddit so might not even know if you sent me a message😊 just letting you know since I’m a little technologically challenged and wouldn’t want you to send me a message and then I don’t reply and you feel abandoned!! By son calls me a lurker - ha. 💕
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,exzgszs,t3_cuoujw,1566665903.0,"It is not your fault, just like the way he treats you and abuses you is not your fault. You are just a decent person who can’t think on their twisted and manipulative level and you let your guard down. I’ve been there and”slipped up” with my NEX too- it always happened when my kids were around and my mind got tricked into that “we should be able to act like a family” fantasy. My NEX loved to paint me as the bad workaholic mom too because I had to use after school care  for the kids and then brainwash the kids into supposedly telling him all the time (when they never said this to me even when I asked) that they wanted to spend afternoons with him. Only to find that his girlfriend or his drinking buddy would in fact be watching the kids. Of course I provided 99.9% of all their needs so I needed to work to support the kids. Of course this is all a part of their game- they take your responsible behavior and love for your kids and twist it in some way to set you up for more of their abuse. So my dear cry and let it out and give yourself the credit you deserve for doing the best you can during the shit show that is trying to be a single mom with an abusive NEX. Hugs to you and your kiddos💕"
LifeAfterNarcissism,exd1170,t3_cs359o,1566164570.0,Same here. I am so afraid of losing myself and having to give up my happiness to placate someone else. It took me 5 years after I divorced my nex to even start to figure out what was truly happening and because we have kids I’m never truly free of him and the manipulation and mind f-ckery. I’m done sacrificing myself so afraid of giving anyone else power over my sanity ever again.
NarcissisticAbuse,ew860jf,t1_ew72zk9,1565203994.0,This for me keeps me from healing- that my kids don’t seem to recognize the abuse and in subtle ways NEX still abuses me thru them even though they are in college now so I don’t have to see NEX.
NarcissisticAbuse,ew85bnf,t1_ew6w4ij,1565203600.0,So well said!!
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,eunlpmy,t3_cgwj79,1563930411.0,Everything is a contest to an narc and the have a win at all costs mentality. They have to get the kids to “love them more!”
