1 box red velvet cake mix
6 cups Cocoa Krispies cereal
1 cup white chocolate chips
Instructions:
Melt butter over medium-low heat in a large pot.

Add cake mix and stir until thoroughly combined. 
Fold in Cocoa Krispies and stir until cereal is evenly coated.
Spread in pan. Chill 15 minutes in refrigerator.
Melt white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute at 70% power. Stir. (Chips will retain shape while microwaving, so don't overheat!) If not completely melted after stirring, microwave in 10-second increments. Drizzle over cooled treats.

You're also far less likely to die if you get the flu shot regardless of whether it's the right strain. People are idiotic about vaccines though and don't genuinely even understand how they work. So not enough people get the shot and we always end up with more deaths than we should.

blogsnark,fo0ofk4,t1_fo012lf,1587416798.0,"THIS. And honestly, in London you can practically spit and hit someone who will recommend their tailor to you. She wouldn't even need to leave her house. They'd have come right to her. With Prince Charles picking up the tab through the Duchy of Cornwall, I'd have even been tailoring my jeans and underwear! LOL!"
blogsnark,fo0nymh,t1_fnzsk42,1587416547.0,"I have a similar build to Meghan. Meaning short waisted with long legs. I get almost everything I wear altered. I just have to. And a good tailor can fix a multiple of problems with fit. 

When I look at some of what Meghan wears, I just want to scream ""get a good tailor!"" I love her wardrobe but it just doesn't fit properly."
blogsnark,fo0lryg,t1_fo02xsn,1587415420.0,That's the way it felt to me too. They felt like the typical paparazzi photos where the paps are called. Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas feel that way to me too.
AmItheAsshole,fnzm026,t1_fnxqn2e,1587396614.0,"That's the point where your boyfriend needs to ask him if he has dementia or Alzheimers. ""You can't remember a simple name, Dad? It's time to have a visit with the doctor."""
trashy,fnsh0kq,t3_g3fu7z,1587221433.0,"Back in Lularoe's heyday, there were actually sellers who got married in Lularoe dresses. It was so cringe. Imaging looking back at your pictures and seeing yourself in a polyester sack that was made by a company that left you in debt. Yikes."
Anxiety,fnpojxu,t3_g2yamz,1587149142.0,"Same. Everyone used to call me a brat because I had ""temper tantrums."" What I understand now is that they weren't tantrums. They were panic attacks. And my parents always made it 10 times worse by saying I was just being spoiled. I was literally the opposite of spoiled. I was anxious and panicking."
blogsnark,fnpcbc7,t1_fnoyzfh,1587142995.0,"My state is one that is already talking about going back to work and I'm terrified. I'm someone who's at risk of getting seriously ill. I can work from home but my husband's workplace has flat out said they'll adhere to the governor's guidelines. If the governor says people can go back to work, that's what will happen. So it doesn't matter if I can work from home. He won't be able to and I'll be put at risk. Our only other option will be him quitting his job. It's madness to me."
blogsnark,fnpbcwv,t1_fnp9amz,1587142518.0,I'm the same. I had pneumonia a decade ago and my top temp was 99. And I mean I was REALLY sick. Hospitalized and everything. Getting doctors to take me seriously when I'm ill is such a pain in the butt. I've had to explain multiple times that a temp in the 98's is a fever for me.
mentalhealth,fnhnts5,t3_f8vmvr,1586965757.0,"I get it completely. I was in crisis and ended up in a psychiatric unit for 5 days. Single worst experience of my adult life. As traumatic as my abusive childhood. The staff were openly disdainful of the people they were supposed to be helping. There was no real treatment, only medication. The boredom and isolation were endless. It felt like I was there for weeks it dragged on so relentlessly. 

The one bright spot was my fellow patients. We became therapists for one another. We helped each other through it. We openly rooted for one another to get released. I learned something through my experience. The people who were supposed to be ""helping"" treat you like you're nothing but they're really the nothings. The patients? They're remarkable. They're resilient. They're strong. And they're some of the best people I've ever met."
blogsnark,fmmicp7,t1_fmmgwch,1586205800.0,"Yeah, I'm not a fan of that either. Our dogs are small but the older one was neglected in her previous home and isn't great around most people. She will definitely nip at someone when she feels threatened. She wears a harness and leash that say ""nervous"" but you'd be shocked at how many people still try to approach her."
JUSTNOMIL,fmmhw5d,t3_fvzvke,1586205562.0,So she wanted to stay with you for an indefinite amount of time and never even asked you? Went through your brother to deliver that piece of info instead? And talked about how hurt she is over a topic she never even brought up with you? Please don't invite that kind of dysfunction into your home. Stand your ground and say no.
blogsnark,fmmg1b8,t1_fmm7el0,1586204599.0,I wonder if she's maybe enjoying having a break. I don't know a lot of people in their 90's who work as much and as often as she does. And I think part of how a person feels depends on if they're introverted or extroverted right now. My mother-in-law is miserable and it's impacting her health. My introvert father-in-law is absolutely loving the lack of pressure to socialize and is thriving. (That pressure is mostly put on him by his extrovert wife. LOL!)
blogsnark,fmm5pwk,t1_fmlgfjf,1586199274.0,Her mother lived to 101. It's possible the Queen will outdo that. I hope so. It's going to be a sad day around the world when she's no longer with us.
blogsnark,fmm4kdj,t1_fmlsyol,1586198669.0,"Me too. I've had people literally running behind me call out ""behind you"" as if I'm supposed to be the one to move out of the way. They're behind me. It's more efficient and safe for them to go around me than for me to try and figure out which direction to move in so they won't run into me. I don't have eyes in the back of my head."
blogsnark,fmm19v0,t3_fvx716,1586196931.0,We took our dogs for our lunch walk a little while ago (our dogs are loving us working from home) and saw a mom and her little girl headed our way. The girl saw our dogs and started running toward us and the mom just laughed. We picked up the dogs and crossed the street away from them and were rewarded with a really weird look from the mom.
blogsnark,fmltxt1,t1_fmllofo,1586193168.0,"I'd be tempted to say ""they're for my granddaughter"" then let her do the mental gymnastics in her head trying to figure out if I was a teen mom or if I just look really young for my age."
blogsnark,fmltms5,t1_fmlmex6,1586193007.0,Our next door neighbors have had bbq's and 3 times per week for the last two weeks with at least 15-20 people over at a time. It's 3 generations under one with roof with a grandmother who has diabetes. The father is obese and is always complaining about his heart problems. It's like watching a train wreck happen in real time.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fmlm7mm,t1_fmjbhgu,1586189130.0,I have a friend who is getting married in August. They contacted their vendors and ended up moving their wedding to next summer. They'd already started hearing from family and friends saying they didn't feel comfortable traveling at all this year. Their plan is to get married by a Justice of the Peace in August and then have a second ceremony and a reception next year.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fmljumm,t3_fvkomi,1586187839.0,"Screw that! She expects a woman in her 3rd trimester to travel to a different country for a wedding? Without her partner? What an entitled idiot. 

Congrats on the baby by the way!!!!!!"
AmItheAsshole,fmemigv,t3_fuql3n,1586008351.0,"NTA. Your parents are, for believing their adult offspring is required to change their beliefs just because they changed theirs. I'd honestly put them in a major time out after that video chat nonsense. 

And what kind of weird LDS sect do they belong to?? I know plenty of Mormons who couldn't care less what I drink in front of them."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fm2y39u,t3_fsh98v,1585708144.0,"With everything going on in the world right now, I loved seeing this. What a sweet, smart dog! No social distancing for him!!"
insaneparents,fm2ksvr,t1_fm0xg6e,1585699511.0,"Their children are the narcs emotional surrogates. Meaning whatever ""negative"" things they're feeling, they put that on their kids. Feel sad? Take it out on the kids. Feel stressed? Take it out on the kids. Feel out of control? Take it out on the kids. During times like this, they don't really want to be around their kids. They just want someone to take out their feelings on so they don't have to feel those things."
raisedbynarcissists,flsgfpi,t1_fls0cqa,1585441554.0,"I will never see my sister in person again and her smirk is how I'll always remember her. That and her squint. Every public interaction with her was always about her figuring out a way to embarrass me or get me to strongly react to something she said or did. I could always see it coming. I'd be talking to someone else about anything, really. She'd get ""the squint"" and I knew she was zoning in on me and was going in for the kill. Usually she'd reveal something embarrassing I'd done in the past. Or sometimes if we were standing in a circle, she'd slowly maneuver herself, inch by inch until she was in front of me and I was excluded from the circle. Then when I'd call her rude and start to defend myself the smirk would start. That's when she knew she'd won. Back then, I wasn't particularly good at walking away from behavior like that so I'd get upset. It's hard to convince people (or even yourself) that you're not the problem when you're the one hyperventilating or crying. 

I still have nightmares about her smirk. More even than I have nightmares about the abuse I went through with my parents. My parents hid some of their abuse better. With my sister, it was always right out in the open and it was always, always public. That abuse made social interactions hell for me for years. I just didn't let people get close to me because I thought every social interaction would be like that. That someone was always going to try to embarrass me publicly to harm my self-esteem. It was pretty fucked up."
raisedbynarcissists,flrz2uo,t1_flrkcue,1585430901.0,Wow. That's crazy.
raisedbynarcissists,flryz2t,t1_flr3dhj,1585430836.0,I'm sorry that happens to you too. :(
raisedbynarcissists,flryy2h,t1_flr0tvg,1585430819.0,Thank you. And yep. Completely crazy.
raisedbynarcissists,flrywum,t1_flrimz1,1585430799.0,"I completely agree. To me, someone like that is just as bad as the narc. They witnessed how that behavior impacted me and they did nothing. Anything to build up or not rock the boat with the narc. It's abhorrent behavior."
unpopularopinion,flrft1h,t3_fqm5g9,1585419313.0,"I think it's an okay language but I agree, it's not sexy to me. I find even English with a French accent is more annoying than sexy. If I were going to rank sexy languages, I'd say upper class British is pretty sexy. Spanish is pretty sexy but not when spoken by people from Spain. They have a weird lisp or something that puts me off. From Mexico to South America though, Spanish is pretty sexy. 

I can't believe I just wasted 10 minutes of my life trying to decide who has the sexiest sounding accent/language. Oh well. I'm under quarantine so I guess it doesn't matter."
JUSTNOMIL,flrf7ms,t3_fqlzr1,1585418964.0,"""She then goes on to say that although he is my husband and I need him, his family needs him too."" What a misguided person. You are his family.
