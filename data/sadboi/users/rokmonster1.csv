* I don't necessarily *decide* to do something like this. I don't have free will (doesn't exist,) therefore I am often not in control of what thoughts come into my head. 
* I do believe I have the ability *to choose what I want to think about.* This is aka free choice. The reasons behind my choice however come in a massive variety pack. Sometimes good sometimes bad. I just know for me the better I become at being more cognitively aware of my thoughts, the better my choices will end up being. 
* There are also a lot of things I don't know. I do not presume to be an expert in anyone else's life. I'm talking about myself in the strictest sense."

Its also worth noting that the problem area is the same area where tiles are butted up together. Why they didn't use tile spacers there beats me. Looks like the grout never had the chance to get into that space. It's probably a pocket where water can go and it's been that way since Day 1 so whatever is under the tile has been softened so it's pliable. 

Hopefully it's not mastic down there. If it is take all that tile out and address that!"

I guess what I'm getting at is it's not really their reputation on the line so much as it's yours. Banks don't need your business, but you need theirs. The idea that you feel you are right is probably justified, but maybe the situation is not worth the potential in the future. For example, what if one day you start working for a company that exclusively banks with Chase and instead of being able to get paid direct deposit now you got to go drive to some other bank that's even farther away from where you live, all because you were flagged for not paying 19 cents. Call me crazy, but I'm going to assume that I am not the only person here who thinks this way. You are not wrong for being upset, but this ain't the thing you are going to want to get so emotional that it botches your future potential banking ops with Chase."

The fact that you are working on this stuff in any way means that you are having success in trying to be a better version of yourself than you were even just yesterday. Great job.

That being said, I've never been on the other end of your acts. I may feel completely different about it if I was. And coming from someone who feels that this type of behavior has played a major role into what is screwed up about them, I strongly urge you to make amends for those inconsiderate acts. Getting right with yourself is one thing but harming others calls for action. Again acknowledgement is key, but know that is just early stage and if you sit on that too long you're not really changing anything about yourself. Having a desire to change isn't really change. I wish I could say that to the ones I love, but in the past when I tried it just made things worse. For them some but for me a fk ton.
