InternalFamilySystems,fpac7zh,t1_fpa7b4y,1588445144.0,">  My understanding: You ""unblend"" from parts, identify them as playing one of these roles (exile, firefighter, etc), you talk ""to"" them and try to negotiate with them to pause their behavior by i dunno, giving them warm fuzzies (yuk) and then you can operate as this pristine, spiritual Self thing (also yuk if i'm honest) 

Thanks for the honesty. I can feel the yuk behind your words :D My understanding is a bit different but that doesn't matter at the moment.

> That there is some way to achieve this in a more objective manner without the playing pretend. I am -- whatever keeps fighting to become normal. 

Some while ago I stumbled upon a blog of a very rational person. He wrote a longish text about how he uses IFS. I haven't read all of it but this following passage seems like it could be in the direction you are looking for:

*""IFS suggests that you can experience the exiles, managers and firefighters in your mind as something akin to subpersonalities - entities with their own names, visual appearances, preferences, beliefs, and so on. Furthermore, this isn’t inherently dysfunctional, nor indicative of something like Dissociative Identity Disorder. Rather, even people who are entirely healthy and normal may experience this kind of “multiplicity”.*

*Now, it’s important to note right off that not everyone has this to a major extent: you don’t need to experience multiplicity in order for the IFS process to work. For instance, my parts feel more like bodily sensations and shards of desire than subpersonalities, but IFS still works super-well for me.""*

> I don't feel invalidated by what you wrote or this therapist. We've had 2 sessions, he honestly hasn't done anything yet. This is based on what I am expecting I will eventually have to do to comply with the treatment. Which if I don't do, I am being dishonorable by not giving a full try of something which I have evaluated as possibly helpful. If I don't try properly I won't know. Giving up without trying fully would make me feel defeated so I don't want to do that either. 

Alright. So you are looking to understand as much as possible about the process and how to do it without feeling invalidated somewhere in the process?

As I understand it the only way to not fully commit is to not go. Because even though it might feel like you don't fully commit, you might just be cautious and test the waters which it totally fine. 

> Yes, I easily feel invalidated. An ""invalidating environment"" in early development is among the traumas which are considered to give rise to BPD. 

Ok, thank you. Sorry to hear that you grew up under difficult circumstances.

&#x200B;

> ""Self"" sounds like it could correlate to what affective neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp refers to as the CARE system of primary mammalian emotions which motivates nurturance of offspring. 

Possible yes. In the end it is a word to describe something, people experienced in therapy. There are many names for it. People who believe ""it"" exists and people who don't :)"

>But yeah, I don’t want to talk to these defense mechanisms of my brain as if they are other people.

Well then you don't :) It is a model to use that helps some people. If it is not helpful for you then use the words that are good for you. And right now that seems to be ""defense mechanisms in my brain"" for example.

I don't understand this sentence. Maybe you can expand on it a bit.

>I guess what I’m getting at is I feel invalidated. Which talking this out has helped me understand better.

Thank you for sharing that. Do you feel invalidated by what I wrote or by the way your therapist does IFS? If some of my words were the reason than sorry for that. I did not intend to make you feel invalidated :)

By the way I read some of you other posts and if I remember correctly then you had to find another therapist because your first one died. I just want to say that I like you courage to open up to another therapist with all the possible uncertainties involved.

>I have BPD so feeling invalidated is on a hair trigger tho.

That means that you very easily feel invalidated? Just making sure I understand you correctly.

Have a nice day.

InternalFamilySystems,fp92gkh,t3_g8m9we,1588411745.0,"Did you find someone? I found an IFS partner here in the group, we are still going and it is very helpful to do it together. Yes it might seem daunting to just do that with a stranger but if you are open then you will not be strangers for long :)"
InternalFamilySystems,fp9252s,t3_gc235f,1588411396.0,"Well I would suggest that you tell this to your therapist and if he or she doesn't change the strategy then think about whether you want to continue with that therapist. 

From your words I get the impression that there is a form of manager who noticed in the past that if parts blended you felt things that were uncomfortable. There is fear of losing control. So one option I see is to work with this part, get to know it. You worked very hard to not dissasociate and now it seems like the therapist is asking you to do that? For it/him/her/etc it is about protecting you/a part of you from being hurt again and losing control. 

One of the goals of IFS is to be able to speak for parts from Self instead of from parts. 

Some parts might want to take over fully or a lot because they are afraid that they will not be heard and cared for and they are in pain. But the good thing is that most often we can talk to them and ask them not to flood us because if they do we can't get to know them from Self and can't heal them. It might take a bit to earn the trust of protectors and exiles. 

It also seems to me as if you view your parts as something you want to get rid of or that is at least not part of you. You call them ""those things"". In IFS we assume that all parts have good intentions and by getting to know them we can learn about those intentions and then help them heal. 

Please let me know if anything doesnt make sense to you or if there are any questions. Welcome to IFS and all the best for your system :)"
InternalFamilySystems,fn3omop,t3_fz6xak,1586624890.0,"Which book are you reading? I really like ""You are the one you have been waiting for"" it is an IFS book about couples/relationships. 

It seems like you are starting out well. You have identified a part that brings you random arousal and the need to satisfy that. Where do you feel this part in your body? Maybe it shows itself in thoughts/images/sensations. See how you feel towards the part, if any of the 8 Cs of Self are present thats a good indicator for Self energy and you can continue by asking what it wants you to know for example. What is it afraid would happen if it didn't use its strategy? And on you go. Maybe at any points other parts step in, maybe a part that wants this over soon etc. Ask them to step back so you can get to know the arousal part from Self and explain why that is helpful. See if they are ready to do that. If not you can change focus on them. 

Let me know if anything is unclear. All parts are welcome :)"
malementalhealth,fn0ij8u,t3_fy2w23,1586542575.0,"Hi,

I have two suggestions for you.

One is if you only want to have the ""quick"" cry release. Of course I can't promise you that it will work but imho it has a good chance to. There is a documentary called [""The Work""](https://www.amazon.com/Work-James-McLeary/dp/B077GGWH8P) (about 4$ to rent) and it is about prison inmates who do group therapy with people from outside the prison. You get to know those inmates who normally are just able to express anger or nothing because everything else is seen as week. But in the group therapy they can release things like mourning the death of ones mother, etc. It touched me more than any movie/game/book. 

&#x200B;

The second suggestion is more like other suggested and might not reap immediate benefits. There is a reason why you find it hard to cry. Maybe a part of you is afraid that if you allow yourself to cry it will not just be some tears that release pressure but maybe other pains may come forward as well and overwhelm you. Just one possiblity. Maybe you can take a moment, close your eyes if that helps, come to rest where you are as much as possible and then feel into your body. What do you feel? Where is the area that doesn't allow you to cry? Is there one? Give it some time. Something else might come up. Be with it meaning if you can, be curious about it ask what is needed, what needs to be heard. If you feel resistance, ask the resistance what it is afraid would happen if you were allowed to cry. Theres not one path that is why it is not so easy to just write a few sentences and you follow along. If you feel like it we could find a voice chat somewhere and explore a little that way :)"
findapath,flgcyzi,t3_fomhy0,1585139264.0,"Hi :)

Congrats on your first reddit post. What I hear from your post is that strategies you used in the past to motivate you and try to find meaning are not working anymore or have never really worked and you are out of strategies at the moment. Also you seem to have some inner conflict where there is fear about starting something and then guilt coming up trying to push you to do something and telling you that not doing it is bad. In my experience only you can find your meaning in life and that you can't find it on the outside because meaning is something we feel inside. So the easy answer might be: ""Love yourself"" or something like that. Maybe something like another person commented about just make a plan, just do it. 

But since you read a lot here on reddit, I bet you have read and hurt this stuff hundreds if not thousands of times and they don't work most of the time because it is not a map on how to do it especially if we don't see our why/purpose/direction. 

Have you ever done any meditation or seen a therapist or something similar? Unfortunately most people do not learn from parents or at school how to handle our internal lives even though that is one of the most important skills imho. 

There might be other solutions but in my opinion the only thing that can bring real progress is to get to know yourself, with all your aspects, fears, motivations etc. and not just from a rational, analytical view point but in direct felt and understanding experience. It seems to me that you are not connected/grounded within. And I am also not talking about some spiritual bs. Let me know if I should expand on that. There are ways to do this and it is also not easy at times but it is also very rewarding. 

You are not alone <3"

SuicideWatch,fksjtgq,t3_fk4n4s,1584491697.0,"Hi, thank you very much for coming here and sharing your pain. I hear you. I read through the comments and noticed some things which I'll put in here with some more words from myself. Sorry to hear that you are in such a bad place at the moment. That does not sound easy at all when you are alone and desperate. I don't know much about narcicism because I do not care about some label that we can put on a person. It might help sometimes to describe something with few words but other than that it can also be a hindrance. What is important is your experience and then possible solutions for the issues if there are any. You are here, you are looking for a way out and you are doing the best you can. With a downward spiral it is understandable that you get suicidal thoughts because if we (seemingly) tried everything else and we can't find another solution at least there is hope for peace. 

Is there more that would like to be expressed? 

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: If any of the following words are not what you need then please ignore them. 

&#x200B;

> I care for no one. I hate myself. I don’t even HAVE a self, I hurt people’s feelings without even realising it until hours later. 

If you would feel for other people, you would most likely also feel your own pain way more than now, so your protective mechanisms shut down your feelings. Self hatred also tries to help you, because if you hurt yourself first then others can't and it is better to feel this pain than the alterantive worse pain. Maybe this does not sound very logical from an outside perspective and maybe your self hatred has some other reasons but it has its role for a reason and it shows that other measures before that did not work out. And even when it takes a while you realize that you have hurt people, so there is self reflection happening.

> When I’ve got only myself to depend on, I break down and and begin to pitifully talk myself out of my mindset to convince myself that ‘everything will be ok really’. 

Again, you are doing the best you can on your own.  Grasping on every piece of hope you can find. <3

> I don’t need a diagnosis to know. I will visit a doctor to get one though. It’s just... what’s the point? I’m a write off. My life is meaningless because I’ve got no meaning to put into it. Exactly what is the point? 

I understand that if the desperation fills you, seeing the light is hard or even impossible at that moment internally. The point at the moment might just be to take this next breath and feel the next emotion that comes up. And be heard and understood by someone who wont judge you :)

> ‘I’m not ok, you’re ok’ resonated with me straight away. From a very young age I found that impressing people with my art and gaining praise for being so talented was something I loved to strive for. Maybe this thirst for praise started there. 

We all try to fill inner voids with outer temporary solutions if we didn't learn how to fulfill ourselves from within. You found something that you were good at and people gave you attention and it worked for some time this way. Now i assume it doesn't anymore and there is a need for an update. Cool, maybe it is still in the bug fixing state and needs some rewriting but then version 2.0 of ""I am ok"" or something like that can start running on your system.

> I accept the theory you presented as being more or less true, for me anyway. Trouble is, I don’t know if there is any starting from scratch for me. I’ve been a narcissist for about fifteen years now, I’m not sure there’s any of that original person left to salvage, he’s emotionally withered and starved. Whenever I drop my defenders to myself and ponder exactly what’s going on in my mind, I cry uncontrollably, non stop. The sadness is too much. 

See here you tell us why you block the pain, because if you just open the flood gates it is understandably too much for you. There are ways to do that in a controlled manner in the speed that is workable for you. And for the question of what is there, that comes afterwards. With all that pain it can be hard to see what else might be there because pain management needs energy and it is right now and not in the future while what might be somewhere to be ""salvaged"" as you call it is not as important as surviving the next moment and making sure that if possible you do not get overwhelmed.

> Maybe I’m not ‘evil’ in the literal term, but all I’ve ever done is hurt people or let them down. 

We can define evil as ""is hurting oneself or others"" but then we have all the connotations to evil,so we can just use other words. Ok, so you have hurt people (one of them being yourself). As I wrote earlier, I bet that even though it might be hard to see, the initial intention of those habits was to protect you and sometimes in the process of doing that we can hurt other people and not notice until later because in that moment they present a real or perceived threat to some part of us and thus our defense gets triggered and jumps in. If we can see that ,we can see that there is a difference between the action that hurt someone and the part of you that wanted to protect you and thus had good intentions.

> I just feel like I’m walking through waist high sludge all the time, slowing me down. I can barely function. I’m constantly mourning the relationship I wasted and my only flicker of a connection with another person. I don’t know what I’m going to do. There is literally no point for me. No point at all. I’m selfish, stupid, useless, unintelligent, socially awkward, emotionally retarded, shell of a human being and the person I used to be, not that the person I used to be was of any use to anyone. I’ve been a narcissist since I was around 15/16, now I’m in my mid thirties and have no external distractions anymore, so now I’m just constantly peering into my own empty, withering soul. I can find no joy in anything I used to. I’m not even a person anymore. I’m literally an Android who’s realised he exists. I’m a body, but there’s nothing inside except for shame and sadness. 

Of course you feel like walking through sludge. The unreleased pain piled up and to not feel it you had to be more protected and that costs energy as well. And now you reached a point where it seems to be too much. I bet that noone else with the same history would act differently. Yet here you are still looking for a solution. Thank you for still putting one foot in front of the other even when weighed down and through the mud. 

> But if I’m a narcissist, what literally is the point?? I’ve read so much research on the internet. There’s no hope. No hope at all. I’m stuck in this static version of myself, not growing, not loving, no real emotions except for sadness and shame. I’m so sad, just so so sad. I’ve never cried so long and so hard, I’m constantly hysterical and in tears when I’m on my own, it’s the only state of mind I have left. As a narcissist I’ve literally given up, I don’t even try to impress anyone anymore because there’s simply no point. I have no friends, and I wouldn’t even know where to begin I’m talking about this with my family. I probably won’t. What mother wants to know her son has no emotions towards her? I just want to disappear. 

I can only try to imagine how you must be feeling. Yes, you are stuck. Everything is screaming at you to resolve your trauma. And maybe you have tried everything you can and with the diagnosis you gave yourself you lost hope. Who would not? My heart reaches out to yours. You are not alone even though it might very well feel like you are. All your systems are doing the best they can and sometimes we need some outside assistance. I am sorry that I do not have a magic button that will take all your pain away in the blink of an eye. But I am here to listen (even though I wrote a lot in this comment). If you want to share more extensively, you are most welcome. If you decide to do so, please make sure (if you can) that it happens at a pace that wont overwhelm you. You can just ask those aspects of you to give you a little room to breathe and tell you everything they want to tell but at a pace that you can handle.

Let me know if something resonated, let me also know if you think something is bullshit :) No matter what, I am looking forward to hear from you. <3"

Psychonaut,fkh4d5z,t1_fkgth10,1584188107.0,"I see this happen a lot on reddit for example but also within myself. Someone seems to offer the solution to our problem(s), yet they do not deliver the manual on how to do it. So because we are (sometimes desperately) looking for a solution, we ask how and we might even get some answers but most answers haven't really helped me.

Here is my try for an answer which might be not useful to you but it might also assist you a bit  :) Let's find out.

Self hatred does not feel pleasant and it is very understandable that parts of us want it to leave us alone so we can be happy. But if we get to know it from a curious mindset then we can discover it's protective function. From an outside perspective this might seem paradoxical. Why would we hate ourselves to protect us if the self hatred can lead to things like cutting or even suicide?  Well it is not the optimal protection but nonetheless a protetice mechanism that was set up at a time where we didn't know better and noone taught us better and since it is so focussed on protection it doesn't notice that we might not be in the same situation anymore. By getting to know it and understanding it's intention we can then discover the burden that it protects us from and use a similar process to transform those aspects of ourselves. While it is possible to do this by ourselves in the beginning at least a trained therapist or sometimes a friend can assist us with that.

If you are wondering how the protection works you can get into a mindful space if possible and ask the self hatred about its intentions. A common answer is that if you hate yourself first even though there is pain involved, noone else can then give you more pain (as it maybe happened before). And by that it is uncomfortable and maybe painful etc but at least in the protecive reasoning not as painful as the protected aspects.

Of course there are the usual answers like go to the gym, eat better, socialize and so on, but while those can help at least in my experience understanding our patterns and protections and inner space is like the foundation from which we then can do things better in the outside world. And of course it is possible and maybe most beneficial to work on both.

Have a nice day :)

Maybe something[ like this can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UfmGwENz9M) be a starting point that is not a theory book or instruction video but a way to get to know the method and get to know its founder and the way he developed the system by trial and error but always with the patient in mind and very self reflective. But since you are writing that ""The body keeps the score"" triggered you it is all up to you to see whether this video or any other medium is for you at the moment. 

> I'm having a hard time with listening to audiobooks. I really don't want to listen to anything now, not even podcasts. It's pretty frustrating.

You did not ask for this so if you do not like it just ignore it. It feels like there is what is called a polarization. Two parts with different goals who want to go on opposite directions (and maybe want the same thing if understood entirely). One part wants to find a solution and thus listen to things, read books etc. and the other part doesn't like it because you were triggered before by those media and then you have another part who gets frustrated because he maybe doesn't know how to resolve that. Those are of course just guesses :)

> I don't know how to communicate with these parts, they're pretty pissed off that I ignored them or tried to force my way or go around them. I also fear what they may bring up that could be too powerful for me to handle right now.
I feel a little better though now that it sounds like there are ""good reasons"" for these reactions.

That is why I love IFS. It does not pathologize. All parts are welcome. There are always reasons for why they do things even though we can not always see that in the moment. 

I can understand why they are pissed off. I guess it is the same feeling you get when you are telling someone about your problems and they say ""get help"". Them getting pissed is their way of telling you: ""Hey mate we don't mean harm, we are here for you, we are doing our best, as are you. And we know that at times we do not use the best way to handle things but we do not know any better. Please listen to us, hear us, understand us."" Of course here as well this is just an example and your parts will use their own words. The fear that they might bring up something too powerful is also understandable. Again here is is a protection. You can try to ask for just a little space to understand a part better and also ask for every part to please not overwhelm you because then you cannot hear them, but if all of you take it very slowly then you can build trust over time. 

Do you know about the role of the Self in IFS?

InternalFamilySystems,fk0alv4,t1_fjzxv2r,1583749871.0,"Hi,

wow. You my friend are doing such a hard job. Inner battles and no outer support. And yet here you are sharing your story and asking for help again even though it did not work out very well in the past because instead of hearing you people just told you to get help which you were trying in that moment. I can hear the pain in your words. No wonder your parts are freaked out. 

Now to your question. Sometimes nothing works because theres not enough trust in my Self. Then time works but takes its time ;) or I find someone to provide Self energy but that isnt always easy but mostly it is like for you ""get help"" have you tried breathing etc. From an IFS perspective the best thing to do is listen to the fear, talk to it, try to understand its positive intent. If it is hijacking you, which is called flooding in IFS then it sounds like a firefighter who thinks you are in immediate danger and it needs to do everything possible to protect you even if that might cause other harm. Richard Schwartz the founder of IFS says that many grounding methods should not be used because it is like ignoring the protector. 

I hope that this doesn't feel like I am trying to lecture you. If it does I am sorry for that. It is not intended. I really appreciate you coming here and sharing openly even though some parts of yourself don't seem to like you doing it."

That is a sign that you are not in Self and another part is blended with you who doesn't like the panic attacks etc. Then you would ask this other part if it is willing to give you some space so that you can get to know the anxious part better from Self and by that be on the way to healing. If it is not willing to you can make this part the target part and ask it what it is afraid would happen if it would give you space (maybe it doesnt trust Self enough and expects another panic attack to happen). So you work with that part. Maybe you need your therapist for the start if no part is giving you space. Remember that it doesnt happen out of spite but to protect you the best way they can, maybe to them you are still a child :)"

As you describe it you have protectors who are very hard trying to protect you from pain. This is not an easy job and takes a lot of effort and energy. In your other post you said that you already see a therapist. What kind of therapist is it? Because I do not like it very much if this therapist just tells you to look into IFS and find out for yourself. If it was just to give you an overview so both of you can work better together that is cool. But as it seems to me at least you are looking for some way to know what is happening with you. Correct? And if you have parts that disassociate then I can understand that it is not easy to then understand what is happening at the same time. That is why at times a therapist or even a friend who knows what he is doing can assist us for some time. 

For IFS the symptoms do not matter too much. What matters is getting to know Self, building trust with parts and healing the exiles. But as I said maybe at the start we need someone to provide Self energy. You are very welcome here, good to have you around :)"

there is a difference between IFS and DID ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative\_identity\_disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) ) they also share similarities. Depending on what your therapist means/says you might wanna clarify it with her. Here is a summary of IFS there are also books and videos about it.  [https://www.derekscott.co/rs/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Exploring-Your-Own-System.pdf](https://www.derekscott.co/rs/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Exploring-Your-Own-System.pdf) 

I found the community to be very welcoming and understanding mostly. IFS assumes that everybody has an internal family systems, for some it is more noticable than for others and DID is like an extreme form of protection. 

Do you have any specific questions? I can understand that not knowing where you belong in your system can be a difficult experience."

malementalhealth,fj00dt8,t3_falpv3,1582883110.0,"Hi dude,

you HAVE to express how you feel because if you don't it will build up and will be expressed anyway at some point or another. I bet there is more inside of you then those few lines. Let it out here or somewhere noone can hear you even then noone can slap a label on you (but yourself). I guess that people who slap a laber to your forehead do this because it is easier than feeling your pain, which would happen if they opened up for your story and that can be hard especially if they have to deal with their own problems.

At the moment of anger or other potentially unpleasant feelings we like to blame others. It is easier. Fuck the incels, fuck the president, fuck the bad driver in front of me. It gives some relief. They did that to me so fuck them. But it also hinders us to notice that the anger is really a defense mechanism to not feel the pain beneath it. The pain of longing for another persons touch or glance. Being seen and accepted. And the fear of rejection. 

Anger can also be a source of great power and clarity to go after your dreams, to stand up for yourself and confront fears etc. In this case it is not the blind, protecting anger but a bright stream of energy. Maybe sometimes only a spark or the thought of a spark but different nonetheless.

Thank you for venting :)"

How has helping people backfired? What happened when you lent your car?

It sure must be frustrating if you try again and again with results that are not what you hoped for. That is also why I asked if you would be willing to see a therapist (or psychologist or shaman or whatever you might like). Not because I say you have to but because especially if you are on your own it might just be some assistance with the frustration and the comparison and the projection into the future.

You are trying the best you can with the (coping) skills you have learned throughout your life.

Maybe interest waynes because fear comes up. That doesnt necessarily mean that you dont like it but that your mind tries to take too many steps at once.

>  they say it isn't as big of an issue (my anxiety) as it seems to pose  on other people but I feel it holds me back from doing the important  things in my life like actually being an outgoing person or going out  because I'm a total shut in. 

Well it doesn't matter if someone elses anxiety is worse if the anxiety you have affects you in a non productive way and you do not know coping mechanisms that work for you.

Aren't things like serotonin inhibitors meant to be taken regularly to be able to first find the proper dose and then take that on a schedule to get the benefits? I don't know how extensive you were examined but it sounds like they didn't really take the time to understand you and your situation and just prescribed some medication and be done with it.

Meeting people as a writer can be very helpful I guess. But you have met people in your life before and I assume being in the military for 5 years, working at staples and also digging up dead bodies and stuff is lots of experience you can draw from. Even if you had not met people you could write about that. Have the main character be a shut in without much social contact.  (Maybe you have read or watched Ready Player One? for example). If you write fantasy you could also start with that and use your Star Wars knowledge to create a story that follows the heros journey. Or maybe for a start pick one of the steps and do a short story about that. You also said that you can finish story which is really good. Many people start lots of stories but don't finish them. Even being homeless for a while could ""help"" with being a writer.

You could also see a doctor about the sweating if you haven't already. There are ways to help with it like special body sprays etc. 

Would you be able and willing to see a therapist/psychologist? You say that your anxiety is holding you back so maybe some outside in person help can assist you.

> A regular work schedule would be ideal because I need to make regular  work to fulfill the burden of the life tax imposed on us all.

Most of the time that is true. Is it possible for you to become a Machinery Repairman in civil life? Is something like that still an interest of yours? Do you remeber your interests as a kid? 

> The feeling of lost is found in what I want to do with my life, not so much how I feel all the time. 

How do you feel all the time? Like when you are not experiencing the lost feeling.

I understand that it can be frustrating if you tried your best and you haven't found something that interests you yet. Maybe you can do something in the direction of this  [https://www.oneweekjob.com/](https://www.oneweekjob.com/)  where a guy did one job per week for a year and made a documentary about it. Thus getting lots of information about different fields. 

Earning a living with writing might not be the easiest thing in the world but it is possible, meaning that you might not become the next stephen King, but you could make a living. (Thats according to Brandon Sanderson who teaches writing while being a famous author and who experiences personally how many of his students go on to make a living with writing after their school). Of course there is learning to be done, mistakes to be made and [the gap](https://vimeo.com/85040589) to be overcome. 

Have you seen someone about your anxiety or are you going to do that? The way you are writing it seems to me that you are judging yourself quite a bit. Like you do not appreciate some parts of yourself and thus there is some tension which might prevent you from feeling your direction. 

I don't know much about the navy/military so I might be completely wrong. Maybe if you are fulfilling orders a lot it doesn't matter too much what you want and thus you don't learn too much about that. 

What are the other small hobbies you were talking about? Yes you said you can't make money with them but it shows us where your interests are located and sometimes we don't see the opportunities we could have with some of our skills. 

And maybe there is something out there you haven't tried yet that gives you more fulfilment than your jobs so far. You could also think about the aspects of work you'd like to have in general. Like what kind of people would you like to work with, would you like to work outside or inside or both, sitting, standing, moving? Would you like a regular schedule or season work, etc. Things that are not a particular job but aspects that might help a bit to focus your search a bit more."

findapath,fdye9gl,t3_el9tc2,1578778801.0,"Hi, in my experience knowing what you want is a mixture of outside experience and connection with your inner world. Wanting something has a lot to do with feeling. You might make the most rational decision and it can still feel wrong. I would also say that dealing with a family member and with a person that we don't know before is quite different. That is one of the reasons why often we go see a therapist instead of parents and friends. Do you feel lost when you write? Are there any activities that draw you in? Which part about helping people with psychological issues do you like? Was there anything about your time in the military that you liked? 

You have work experience, you have lots of skills you can use even if you are changing your field. If you like tech and psychology maybe you can help people like the headspace people with their app. Or create an app yourself for people with problems then you dont need the patience for people and maybe you prefer to do the user interface and functionality and let someone program the tech itself if you can't wrap your head around the programming.

Maybe there are lots of tech people who need some psychological guidance and with your tech background you might be able to better understand them than a ""normal"" psychologist.  There is also stuff like technical writing which might be a compromise for a while to write and be able to earn money. Although in this case it really depends who you believe because there are people who say that it doesn't matter what you do if you get life experience so you have something to write about and that it could hinder yourself when you write as a job to be able to write what you really want to write in your free time. Yet there are people like James Patterson, who started as a marketing writer and then wrote his books. 

And coming back to the first paragraph, are you feeling lost only in regards to what job you like or is there a general feeling of emptiness, etc?"

thank you for sharing. It seems like you are overwhelmed. Overwhelmed with how you judge yourself for feeling miserable while not being able to see why that is the case, you seem to have everything yet you are not happy. Overwhelmed because you store those feelings inside yourself without being able to talk about it with your loved ones because you want to protect them while also wanting to be honest and share and connect. 

Wow. That's not easy my friend. You have been carrying this stuff for years while functioning well on the outside, stuff piled up and as it seems noone taught you the proper methods for you to process your internal stuff. I can only try to imagine how much strenght it took to carry on for such a long time. I am proud of you for not giving up even when you feel like doing so. 

It is also very understandable that there comes a point where everything becomes too much to keep quiet. It seems like you reached such a point. You took care of what we get taught. Family, a home, work (I assume). And now is the time to take care of the things many people don't get taught. How we manage our emotions. We can go for quite some time suppressing them and ignoring them and all that but if there are unresolved issues eventually they come to the forefront.

&#x200B;

> I feel like I’m bragging, but I really honestly feel so disconnected from myself. 

I feel a connection while reading your post. I feel pain that is too much to handle because you can't find a solution. I feel compassion for that part that is in so much pain. 

It can be really hard to tell our loved ones something we have been holding inside for so long. 

If you suffer you suffer. That is your experience. There are traumas we can't access at the moment because we are protected to not feel the pain (even thought this can bring its own pain). And it doesn't have to be something very obvious like being beaten as a child or something like that. Maybe we didn't get enough attention from adults, maybe we were not supported in the way we needed it. Those kind of traumas are not seen easily and thus we can think that there is no reason to feel bad. But in my experience there is always a reason. Sometimes it is a physical reason when we don't have the proper nutrition/exercise/hormones etc. and that is something you could get checked if you haven't done so. And other times there are emotional reasons. Those are legitimate problems as well, they are just not as easily recognized as a broken leg or starvation or problems you read about in this sub and compared to your outer experience.

It seems like you are  a very caring person who is also looking to be cared for. 

What is your family? I dont know how to ask this better but like are you part of a family or are you the provider for a family, etc?

It seems that it is not resolved for you and some part of you wants closure while other parts have opposite opionions and thus you do not have a clear decision. Now if you are willing to you can explore those closer and understand both positions and see what is the best decision for you in the end

I had a friend a while back. I felt like we were pretty similar personality wise and developed feelings but they were never really expressed. Communication was gone, I didn't think much about her. But then I learned stuff about myself that I really felt could help her with her situation. I wasn't sure whether I should call, afraid of getting attached again, afraid she might find it stupid and maybe more of that sort. But the heartfelt concern and wanting to share was staying and so I decided to follow that. We talked two times on the phone, we talked about the past which was actually quite fun with the distance, we shared our situations and all that stuff. It felt relieving to do. I noticed that I still liked her but at the time she wasn't interested so I said good bye again. No regrets.

With other people they might not answer or the conversation doesnt go deep but we can't know beforehand. 

Everybody would give you different advice based on their experiences, life circumstances, etc.

Maybe ask yourself something like what is the worst thing that could happen and would you be ok if it happened? Are you going to wonder how it would have turned out when you don't send the message? And many more questions that are possible. 

There is no right or wrong decision. There is your decision and then you get to experience some uncertainty before you know how it turns out. Quite exciting :)"

InternalFamilySystems,f8etm8z,t1_f8elgx2,1574533613.0,">There's an order of operations here that resembles the catch-22 I mentioned earlier. Dealing with the critic and related parts is something I think will require a much better ability to access the Self and much more practice working with parts in general. Also, the critic is a roadblock to both of those things. How do I get this off the ground?

That is exactly the point where I don't have an answer right now. If I would have a go it would involve trying stuff I read in the book maybe with other things from experience. According to the book I am reading the therapist or you check for Self and if something else is there you handle that until you have enough access to self to work with the rest. So 2/3 is absolutely better than none. One other way I can think of is hypnosis because with that an experienced practicioner can assist you getting relaxed and access to self and then lead you through the IFS process. Or the ""hardcore"" kind of would be psychedelics but I am not advising them to you since depending on where you life they are illegal on not without risks.

>Perhaps if I were to start working in this modality, if I could get some other parts to open up a bit. See that I can calmly assess their goals, and that I really want to help them change in a positive way. Perhaps then they would start showing me that they are complex agents with a full range of human emotion. That's something I am yet to experience with a part, and believing in it without that experience is a challenge for me. Right now I get physical cues and a feeling more like flipping a switch: true, false, yes, no. Something pretty mechanical. Why not start with what matches my subjective sense and only expand my scope when/if I start to feel it.

That sounds good to me. You can always only start from where you are now anyways :) 

>I think it's actually not impossible to imagine traumatic experiences without a lot of complex emotion involved. Some that I've been through myself, as the event itself is unfolding, leave very little room for anything more than intuition (which I consider a kind of proto-emotion). RUN. FIGHT. SURVIVE. These signals have a tendency to drown everything else out, with very good evolutionary purpose. After such an event we might develop emotions about it. But the exile created by such an event does not seem to need complex emotion. Get away, and stay away. Single celled organisms can develop that kind of ""feeling"".

What I meant that a trauma without any emotion seems impossible to me. Does it need complex emotion? Maybe not. Considering that every emotion is or can be complex, can it not? There are whole books just about intuition ;) Do you mean that if we are in a survival situation then we don't think a lot we act on emergency patterns, like fight or flight reaction? Hm I am not sure if the get away and stay away is the exile. Sounds more like a protector/manager who protects one from the pain of the exile. Does the exile need complex emotion? Possibly not (always). At times it is the need to be held like a baby when it was created at the time of being a baby and feeling alone. 

>I think one of the aspects of IFS I find most appealing is the focus on creating some distance so you can make better observations. Considering a part to be simple helps me create distance. The more each part is like an entire me the harder it is for me to make that space, particularly in terms of preventing other parts from becoming involved in the interaction. Parts that want to assert themselves onto me or others like me.

Ok, so you like to consider parts as simple. Then the next step seems to be to ask that part if it is willing to give you some space so you can get to know a part better and see how simple it is.

> Why not attach a framework that makes the minimum number of assumptions needed to describe what I'm experiencing, and adopt a more complex viewpoint only when it's needed to explain new experiences? This is a viewpoint the scientist in me has a lot easier time being calm and curious and confident about.

Maybe it depends on the subject we use rationality for to change beliefs. Maybe it depends a lot on ones mode of operation. I'd like to help you with using a base version and expanding if needed. I just didn't know how to translate it into the model with the machine you described. Because as far as I understand IFS emotions are essential. The interaction with a part can vary greatly as you mentioned. It might be that you are more intelligent and/or rational than I am and thus I can not provide the complexity you may need. For IFS to work I don't think you need to believe in it. And I guess it is possible to make it like a scientific experiment. Thats actually how it started. A therapist noticed that his clients or some were not being helped enough by the methods he new. They were talking about parts, so he started experimenting with what he learned as a family therapist and treated those parts like an internal family. And he tried what worked and what didn't and created a model that is now called IFS. (If I remember the story correctly). Now you seem to want to start your own experiment. Noone can stop you :) If you try every rational approach you can think of, then you can try add in some emotional approach and create a spreadsheet with notes and stuff. You start with a newbie mindset as much as possible and see if every part of you is on board. If some or one is not check out why and address that. Continue. 

Have you considered watching the documentary? Sometimes just words are not enough to help us really feel our emotions because we got big strong protection around them. Doesn't have to be called a protector or part either there are other names in other branches of psychology for it as well. A therapist I know used to be a therapist for murderes, sex crime etc. He told me that with some guys when he asked them why they killed someone they said: ""I don't know"". He asked them where they feel their anger. They said that they didn't feel any anger. He laughed and they would have killed him if they were not in a prison because the anger was just below the surface but they didn't have the connection to it. Of course I am not saying you are a murderer. In the documentary theres one guy from the outside who wants to experience the group therapy. He says that he doesnt have any issues. The other guys invite him to share his troubles but he doesnt. After three days he starts to cry. So sometimes we are not aware of what we are not aware. And maybe you are just way more rational than emotional. It is just one idea I have you might try if you feel like it. But like I said maybe not alone if possible. At best your therapist is so experienced that he can feel your emotions better than you can. But there aren't too many of those around in my experience.

Maybe you know something specific I or someone else can help you to build your own version of IFS. You might also try to write Richard Schwartz or someone else who has many years with IFS and ask if they have a suggestion.

A person could have told them, that they are objectively and scientifically wrong and black people are humans like they are and think and feel like them etc. They believe they are superior to black people. But when they met this guy and became friends with they had an internal conflict. The believe vs their direct experience of liking a black guy. I feel that it is the same for you in a way. You are trying to tell the Klan members that what they are doing is wrong and you don't understand why they do what they do the way they do. You would want at least some of them to leave you alone. But they don't change. (I am not sure if this is the best comparison) It is not supposed to mean that you are not doing anything in that direction, in fact you have been doing that and you are trying to make it work. 

I am not sure if I am able to provide that. I can try but it might be better to do that with your therapist because he is trained to do that and since you already are there he most likely has a plan of doing his therapy and it might be detrimental to then do something else as well.


>By the way, this conversation is really helping me hammer out some of my difficulties and potential solutions with IFS. If I'm coming across as hostile to your viewpoint, please know that I'm really just trying to maximize what I gain from each response. Thanks!

InternalFamilySystems,f8e080p,t1_f8csa4k,1574515110.0,"> I exhibit some of the symptoms of CNS, mostly an ability to numb emotions and lack of confidence/self-respect. But these developed parallel to major depressive episodes which began in my 30s. Prior to then I believe I had a healthy level of confidence and felt little need to suppress emotions.

Thank you for sharing those insights. Maybe the labels are not very important. You numb emotions and there is a lack of confidence/self-respect. I guess if you see 5 different therapists they could give you at least two different diagnosis if not everyone of them gave you a differnt one. What matters is the action that is needed to get better imho. 

>In the murderer analogy, my version provided a purposefully weak justification. If we were to discover his motivations were so trivial, perhaps even you would lose some of your sympathy for them. Such simple causes for extreme action evade understanding by most humans. In your version, the murderer has multiple interacting and complex emotions as well as tragic situations which has informed their decision to take extreme action. The description of how protectors and exiles arise does not seem to describe anything as complex as your scenario. Exiles are created by a single traumatic event. Protectors arise to do whatever it takes to get out of triggering situations, and later to prevent us from triggering exiles in the first place. Unless parts have their own parts (exiles in particular), which starts to sound more like DID to me, they more resemble the murderer with simple motivations.

Do you know of any murder that happened with a similar weak justification and nothing more behind it? If they were really like ""oh a dog bit me, lets kill its owner because of that"" yes i guess I would have a hard time understanding that. But I can't think of that just happening without any other reason involved. As I understand it, exiles can form from one event or over a prolonged period of trauma (and trauma can be something seemingly small at the moment). In the book I am reading at the moment (Jay Earley) there is a woman who describes that it wasn't one event but a period where she felt very alone when she was very young. But I am not an expert in IFS (yet ;)). From what I understand DID is like the extreme and unvoluntary form of IFS where the parts are more seperate and maybe more complex yes. 
Is it possible that you/ a part of you is trying to reason through why your impulsive part is doing something for example? You write that you know the motivation and it is also not a justified motivation. (>prevents me from feeling anxiety,ok). I think the problem is that if we are in an inner critic mode/the inner critic part is active it is very hard if not impossible (in my own experience) to understand other parts or other people. For example my brother recently just said that I am just too afraid. And from his perspective that isn't really false but from my inner experince there is a whole world to that, stories, images, experiences, mental wiring that developed, habits, etc. That is why we try to access a critical mass of self to open a space for the part to explain itself. So I don't feel understood by him and I do not open up to him and even if I would he would most likely not understand me.

>In my therapy thus far, I've worked by accepting my parts as subtle shifts in narrative, physical sensations and similar. I'm not waiting for them to walk through the door and talk with an Irish accent. When I ask them questions, and then search my own mind again for the answer, sometimes I have a newfound feeling about the question: true, false, yes, no. Again, if that means I'm not destined to succeed in IFS I'd like to hear it.

I can't tell you if you are destined to succeed or not in IFS. I have only words from you and impressions those words leave within me. For example when I read the second half part of your last comment before this one, I got some tears in my eyes because it made your situation a lot clearer to me and I had a felt understanding (not claiming to fully understand you or anything like that) of what is happening. For me it doesn't have to be someone with an irish accent either. An example from yesterday. I was talking to my mother. She was a little upset and wanted to get that out, share it. I wanted to listen to her (not full self but caring) but at the same time there was anger in my stomach, an angry child part that was saying (internally) ""why do I have to be your parent when actually you are mine and should behave like it? Why couldn't you teach me how to handle my emotions, etc."" I recognized that and even then it influenced the way I communicated with her. Instead of just letting her express her frustration and maybe agree that it wasn't a pleasant situation, I asked her why she didnt tell the person who upset her directly and that she was afraid to do that and now I receive the energy of the event. (I said this pretty calm but still there was in the end a child that wants attention and love from his mom). You could also reframe this and say I felt a needy feeling and anger while wanting to give her emotional support and give her space to vent. (same thing basically but one with a part theory attached and the other just from a me = I = one person.

>When you encounter something you don't have the resources to handle, your brain records it as a thing to avoid at all costs. It builds routines to A) get you away from that thing ASAP and B) keeping you away from whatever led to it in the first place. The subroutines operate on a basis of input information, and they interact in strange and sometimes contradictory ways by making calls to each other and feeding each other their (possibly bad) outputs. The sum of the outputs is how the machine decides to take action. You can't use a subroutine to reprogram another subroutine, at least not in a way that accomplishes the whole machine's goals, because they don't have access to the whole scheme. The only one who can reprogram them is a routine that has access to the scheme, and only has the goal of making the machine work as intended. That entity can feed a buggy routine new information and write better bits of code than it had when the buggy routine was written. This requires the entity to be able to read an entire routine's code to debug, and then input the new information to get it processed correctly.

It seems like you are some kind of programmer :) I find it very interesting to read your concept of the IFS Human interaction machine. It is also very hard for me to work through it and then find an answer but I'll try my best. 

How do you know that you are not at the moment acting on the sum of the outputs of your subroutines and by doing that trying to get away from feeling and thus staying away from pain? And the way to do that is to be like a machine? IFS doesn't have to be about crying children. (You could ask yourself here why you don't feel comfortable with the thought of it being about crying children and listen for an answer). Maybe there is a big ass robot protector who blocks/numbs your emotions to protect you from them. Maybe if that is the case or something in that direction you can ask that dude if he is willing to give yourself some space for the moment and it can come back afterwards so you can test some different code you found. You will test run the code and compile it and check back with him. If it is not willing to, ask it what the concerns are. Maybe in your model you can run some code that checks if a subroutine is currently running. If yes then you can let the entity check the code. Can you read it clearly? What does the code say? Maybe the subroutine has some needs (I dont know the code equivalent maybe open queries or variables or smth like that) and because of that it has sent out failure messages that activated parts to shut the code down without telling the whole system. Now when the entity got the password to check the code and the subroutine shows what is needed and lets the entity read the code, the entity can provide the things that are asked for by the subroutine. 

What is uncomfortable for you about ascribing emotions to the parts? To me it seems like your model is more active than IFS needs it to be. As the Self you don't tell the parts that they don't work properly and what the optimal way of working would be. That is what the inner critic for example does which leads to the parts not sharing their story because they feel judged and they are being judged at that moment. You tell them that you would like to get to know them because you feel something is not right. Then you listen. Then you ask them what they need. And then you can give them what they need. Then they are able to transform (this doesnt have to be instant, healing takes time) and then they can have a different function but also one that the self doesnt have to tell them but they choose because they get the freedom to do so or maybe they can figure it out together. And at least in my opinion emotions are crucial for IFS and for life as well. If I ask you how you are that is about emotion. You know when you need to eat through feeling hunger, you know if you like someone or not, if there is (perceived) danger or not. But it is not about ""oh there's a bunch of crying children in me (or at least some book or dude says that) and I just need to love them and everything will be sunshine and rainbows"". I can not imagine a trauma that is not about emotions. Thus we need to incorporate them. And if you don't want to do that, that is an emotion as well. You could say it is getting to know you. And the parts aspect is supposed to be a help for visualization and being able to create some distance so you can observe better. If it helps you maybe there is a way to incorporate emotions into the model of the machine and subroutines."

InternalFamilySystems,f8b84b7,t1_f8b8402,1574430013.0,">This ties a bit into what you said about ""thinking through"" things and not ""feeling through"" them. In one sense I can't comprehend the meaning of this. I feel things, and I know when I'm feeling them. And while I am experiencing them, and in fact every waking moment of my life, I am also thinking about all kinds of related and unrelated stuff. That is who I am. There isn't another floor above this one. Even the part of me that thinks about the way I think, and learn, and might try or want to change them is still exactly that guy. I can recognize that sometimes (or usually) I am ignoring that guy, and that's where I identify parts. But if IFS is dead set on telling me that the most continuous and coherent voice of my self narrative is not who I am, and instead it's someone I have never encountered in my life ... welp, I'm off to greener pastures, because that's some mighty hateful shit to try to talk someone into.

I don't think that IFS is trying to talk you into anything. Instead it is offering you to experience yourself through a framework. There are other frameworks as well. Thinking through and feeling through are maybe not the best ways to say it. I am still exploring life as well :) I know people who when asked: ""Where do you feel anger?"" answer: ""I don't know, I know when I am angry and that is enough for me"" and then others who say for example something like: ""I feel anger in my throat, it is hot and pulsating and it can spread to other parts of the body, my thinking changes when I am angry and I can release but sometimes it gets bottled up"". One person is more in touch with their feelings. The other one might also be a bery rational, logic person. For me at least it doesn't feel like a floor above but more like a deeper level. Maybe like if you watch a movie on a laptop in bad quality and with bad speakers. And then you watch it in a theater. You see the same movie, same action, dialogue etc but it is also a different experience. 
Only you can really know who you are in my opinion and IFS might be able to assist you in getting to know you better. It seems like there is some fear involved. With all the things happening in your live you at least know who you are because you have known yourself for all of your life. And then it seems like someone attacks that notion and says ""Hey tarski, you are not tarski but xy"". If that was true then what could you hold onto and so on. (Thats what fear **might** say). When you play a roleplay game if I may use that example (you have a post about a bard) aren't you then a little different than ""normal"" you. I havent played it much but according to my understanding and IFS maybe we could say you assume a part of a bard. You let it flood you and for the time of the game you are the bard. Now in your daily life maybe its more subtle but angrytarski might use different words compared to relaxedtarski for example. 

>Luckily, I don't think that IFS, or at least my therapist, is so dogmatic. Unless an expert needs to disabuse this notion, I think IFS has room for a less extremist viewpoint on the process. And I don't mean to imply that you think that way either. 

In my understanding it is a tool. You can use it as you like. If you can't assess what the theory calls the Self than maybe you already are or you don't want or need to and you can use the questions for self reflection (not about big SELF but you as you understand and know you, sometimes language can be tricky ;) ). I am very glad to hear that you like your therapist. I am pretty new to IFS so I am not dogmatic about it but it has helped me to put some things into words that I have experienced or looked for and could express but only clumsyly and always looking for someone who understands. 

>But I'm still wondering what the response is when even your Self thinks a part is at best a creature that can be understood, but not loved. That it needs to be told not to do that anymore, but can't bring itself to feel overly sympathetic toward the path that part has taken. When telling a part that it's a good little boy, and was only ever trying to help you while it wrecked your life, is a statement you know to be false and in violation of the core of your being.

I am not sure that I understand this part correctly. Are you talking about you trying to understand parts of you and IFS in your understanding telling you to love a part and you can not bring yourself to do that because you think it did things very wrong and it doesn't deserve love. Or something in that direction? 

&nbsp;

I did not intend for this to become that long. But while reading through your comment I could also feel that it wouldn't be short if I wanted to try to express myself well. Or at least try to do that. There's no TLDR for that reason, feel free to ask anything, to tell me whatevery you might think or feel about it. I want to make one offer. There is a documentary I watched a while back. And among every movie (documentary or cinema or whatever) it moved me the most. It is about a high security prison in the US where the prisoners do group therpay and people from the outside can come in and participate. They don't use IFS if I remember correctly but they address suppressed emotions and with that you could say they access parts. It is at times very rough and emotional and because of that I am a bit concerned so please consider your emotional state if you decide to watch it or maybe watch with someone else. There are murderers and people we might just judge as bad people but during the documentary we get to know their whys and their internal lifes. That doesnt make them saints or their deeds good but for me at least I understood more. You can find it here for example (https://www.amazon.com/Work-James-McLeary/dp/B077GGWH8P), and if you want to watch it I am offering you to pay it for you since you said you are not in a good financial situation. Have a good day or night wherever you are <3"
InternalFamilySystems,f8b8402,t1_f8adxgh,1574430005.0,"**I appreciate the detailed and thorough answer. And I want to start this answer with a plea to either ignore things that might upset you or tell me so I can try to clarify if you wish. I am writing this first because while reading through your answer many things come up for me and I'll try to express them as well as I can but there is always the potential for words especially since we don't hear or see each other might be misunderstood and I don't want you to feel worse because of something I expressed badly. Here's also the standard ""I am not a native speaker"" :) This will be two comments because I wrote too much for one comment ... :D**

>There seems to be a catch-22 here. Ask the parts to give you space, but that only works coming from the Self. And how do you get to Self? Ask parts to step away ......

Hm I thought about that myself. Which part is asking to give space if I can't connect with self? I haven't found THE answer yet. It seems to be some rational, brainy part that can follow instructions. What matters is that someone asks, whether it is the therapist or some part of yourself. I don't think that that has to come from self because like you said that is a catch-22. 

>I know that there is no magic wand and therapy takes time. However, to detect zero progress on these fronts after 10+ sessions might be a hurdle I can't overcome, financially or practically. I've already lost my job, tried to kill myself, ruined relationships, and these problems are ongoing. If it's going to be two years before I make progress on any of that, then you're telling me to find a different methodology.

I understand that this is not easy for you. I wasn't trying to tell you to find a different methodology. It was just one option that crossed my mind (that getting to know ones emotions can take some time and also therapy in itself) and also something my therapist told me a while ago when I asked him why some things take so long. I really don't know how I would feel in your situation with all the aspects you mentioned and then trying to connect to some part that I never felt before and am not sure it really exists. Thank you very much for doing your best and sticking with it. 

>Sure. I have an impulsive part that sometimes gets me to jack-off, figuratively and literally. At it's worst it puts me into various life threatening situations. The motivation I can identify is that this prevents me from feeling anxiety. OK, so it has some reason for having me almost die, but as I see it this is a completely unsympathetic, wildly disproportionate and basically wrong motivation.

Ok we have an impulsive part here and a motivation that you have identified rationally (meaning it is not something the part told your self). To the rational mind this can seem unsympathetic, wildly disproportionate and basically the wrong motivation because it at times almost gets you killed. If we use book terms it seems that you have a protector and some kind of part (maybe Exile) with fear and maybe something else that it is protecting. Doing impulsive things might be the only thing this protector could come up to try and help you not feel the emotions of the exiled/unknown part. Yes, that is strange because why would someone do that, fight pain with pain as it seems. Maybe it assumes that whatever you do while you have those impulses and whatever the outcome (even dying) is better than having to experience whatever the exiled part had to experience. That is where self comes in with a curiosity for example and love. It doesn't mean that it loves doing life threatening things and supports those activites. It means that you come from a place where you seek to understand the motivation. They might not be logical. But they might have been the best option a possibly younger part could come up with in the moment it needed to. Maybe it didn't learn how to use a more rationally appropriate action. To me it seems that there is one part (maybe more) who are activated when you try to talk to the impulsive part. There seems to be anger that the part acts the way it does - unsympathetic, wildly disproportionate and basically wrong motivation- and you/this part wants it to stop doing that because you want to get your life in order. Or in your words you want to put out the fire but this part seems to pour some gas in it.


>In order to protect me from getting bored with my project, you're going have me take a potentially fatal dose of opiates? I do not feel caring towards that. I can and have tried to ""fake it"" by saying ""OK, I can see that you have some reason for doing that. I'm really sorry for that. But really, I don't need that response so please stop. Or at least give me some space."" I wish that worked, but it does not.

I assume the part who is doing the talking here is under pressure. Your house is burning, you lost your job, tried to kill yourself, ruined realtionships, etc. You want a solution now or soon so the impulsive part better stop doing its thing. Maybe this part needs some attention first because it tries to protect your life and is not ready to step back for you to better understand the impulsive part. 


>I don't have huge problems I'm running away from. I recall no trauma as a child: I was generally blissfully happy. This is the kind of thing I would compare to reading a thriller and thinking ""Yeah, this guy killed his neighbor because their dog bit him and he didn't feel they took appropriate action. That's why he's doing this. I still don't feel bad for this murdering dirtbag.""

Sometimes there are things we don't even notice that unconsciously or consciously have a bigger impact than we might think. Even though you do not recall any trauma maybe you didn't get something that your child you needed at the time (attention, love maybe some structure if you had too much freedom) and you didn't get it. But because you didn't get it you also don't remember not getting it. This doesn't mean that I am suggesting that you have a trauma from being younger but there is a possibility. If you are interested and have the capacity, you can look into Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN). But I think that IFS handles that as well it is just the part about trauma that can happen annoticed that I haven't seen explicitly in IFS. 

In your example we can try to understand why he murdered his neighbour. From the outside it is not a reasonable answer to a dog bite. Maybe this dude has a past with dog experiences. Maybe his dad bred dogs and used them to sometimes punish his son when he wasn't behaving as he wanted him to. Maybe he was bitten a few times. He got angry at his dad. He didn't feel loved by his dad although he wanted to. He couldn't express his anger to anyone at the time because his mom was dead and there weren't any relatives who would really listen to him. He was angry but also scared at his dad. Eventually he grows up (on the outside) but a part of him on the inside feels still like the boy he was, angry, scared maybe he even turned the anger into self hatred and didn't know what was wrong with him for his dad to hate him so much. (When really his dad hated himself and didn't know how to love his son). Our murderer doesn't have the best relationship with his neighbour, maybe because of his dog, maybe because he wears his beard like his dad or maybe theres something else, he is not entirely sure. Then one day he is on his way home when the neighbours dog runs out of the open gate and bites him. His well hidden inner child floods him with all the repressed anger and fear and other feelings and he snaps, kills the dog and rings the neighbours bell and when he opens he just hits him in the face and again and again until his neighbour is on the floor, bloody and motionless. 

All that doesn't mean I have to love the guy as a murderer. But from Self I can try to understand him as well as possible and feel with him. All the pain he had to endure with noone around, etc.

>If I'm supposed to apply the opposite of that thinking, to feel bad for a killer with piss-poor reasons to do what they did, all I can say is my truest and realest Self is not comfortable with that. If IFS says the ""true"" me just loves that guy, I guess I might be out. Where is the room for any moral compass, any goals, any part of you that feels anything else being ""you"" in that way of thinking? Everyone is the world has the exact same ""true Self"" which ignores any intuition, any sense of wrong and right, any purpose, and instead it just wants all your parts to feel loved?

I don't think that IFS says to just love the guy. As I understand it it is more about a loving intention meaning that I am willing to hear you out, to look at the world through your eyes and hear it with your ears and listen to your thoughts, try to feel what you feel. And by doing all that I might understand meaning I might feel with you. That doesn't have to mean that I agree with everything or that I can't have a moral opinion on what you did but I might not judge first but listen and try to understand first and maybe judge afterwards. (I don't think Self is about judging but other parts might). If we are talking about you and your parts then after the understanding part we can then ask the part what it needs. Maybe it is love, maybe it just wants freedom to play, maybe someone to talk to regularely or something else."
InternalFamilySystems,f89bv0d,t3_dzmanu,1574370475.0,"Disclaimer: These are impressions I have not certainties, a part of me is afraid that I might lead you in the wrong direction by accident and wants that expressed :) 

Hi, sorry to hear that you are having a difficult time accessing the self. What does your therapist say about that since it seems he is qualified maybe certified in IFS? From my limited understanding it sounds like maybe you didn't take enough time to get to know the protector(s) and/or you are trying to do that from another parts perspective and not from self. You say that you often feel disappointed or resigned and according to the book that is not coming from self and there might be another part that needs to be adressed first and give some space for you to access self. You can ask the part that feels disappointed and/or resigned if it would be willing to step aside so you can get to know the inner critic or whatever part you are trying to access. If the answer is positive. See how you are feeling again.

Also it seems to me from the way you are writing that you are more used to thinking through stuff instead of feeling through them, is that correct? If so our brain needs time to build new connections and learn to recognize how we feel and what we feel. 

As far as I understood IFS can be used to get in contact with any part. But also like the book says there might be times where it is safer to do with a therapist or so because of things that might come up.

Can you describe an aspect of a part you are having a hard time feeling compassionate towards?"

I like the idea of keeping a notebook. I am pretty sure that you noticed that too but maybe it helps to point it out:

> which, yeah, sounds fucking insane.

This is a part of you writing. If I may guess it is afraid of being judged bei us readers and assumes we might think you sound/are insane and by writing what you did you take that away by judging yourself before we can. 
(Also the ""fuck off, boring bitch"" seems to belong to the same kind of thinking/part)
There might be other aspects and I might be wrong of course :)

Maybe what you need is just some time. You mentioned that you are new to IFS and been in either rational or hopeless mode. We need time to get to know these new concepts and how they work, how they feel, etc.
For me there are times when I can't access self because there are parts blocking it, wanting or even demanding attention. It can be hard because if they are all I can feel in the moment then it can also feel like it wont ever change -> hopelessness. 
There might also be parts of you that are afraid to access Self. Because feeling good can create fear that it will not always be that way. I am just starting out to use the concepts of IFS but have been involved with feeling the parts (even when not specifically calling them that) and as far as I can tell you are doing good. You have your notebook. You engage with what you can access. You ask questions, you explore. Back in school we had to do gymnastics and I sucked at it. I didn't like it because I was afraid and the teachers didn't seem to care to much or explain a lot or even insult you for not being able to do an exercise. They talked about always using body tension. And while I kind of understood the concept I didn't have a felt body representation because I was busy with my fears and coordinating my body at all in a way to do strange exercises. Maybe it is a little like that with Self and IFS. We are just starting to explore our psyches and parts and trying to connect the words from a book to our experiences. Maybe you are just starting to work out with what you have, discovering things, getting used to things, building some muscle.

I was asking because above you said that you wanted to do that for a year. This is not an accusation. It is very hard to start things when energy is low.

That is why we need those baby steps. You got it planned out, you know what and how to do it. What happens if for example to today you choose to go outside your door no matter what you feel like. And then you can either keep going or go back inside. But you have to smell the fresh outside air at least no matter the feelings. And afterwards you congratulate yourself because you took a step (a few steps actually ;) ).  Some people say that motivation only follows action. I do not agree with that. There are times where energy is just there and/or motivation, but sometimes we are also so used to our own not so pleasant feelings that it needs a little push a little climb over the barrier to get the energy started. If you don't feel like doing that maybe theres is something you can come up with, something small that might seem very insignificant compared to everything you want to do but it will be a start. 

If all that is not for you we could also go into this feeling of being always tired, no motivation, etc and explore that more."

SuicideWatch,f7s0bz4,t1_f7pr47h,1573989469.0,"Something that a therapist told me once when I was afraid of doing something and fucking it up and being embarassed was: Put on diaper and fuck up as bad as you can (if it isn't something that can hurt you maybe even do it intentionally). A diaper because in my native language we say something that might be closest to shit the bed in English. And afterwards you proudly take that diaper and put it on the wall like a trophy. All figuratively of course but meaning that yes there are fears that are essential for our survival and then there are learned fears and social fears that hold us back by telling us how bad things might be or feel and they omit telling us how good it can feel to do something even if we fuck up badly.

And then all that is of course easier said than done. 

Do you have a next (small) step in mind you'd like to tackle first?"
SuicideWatch,f7ookee,t1_f7o33lk,1573930998.0,"To me it feels like you are starting already. With talking here, with reflection with some ideas what you can do.
With so many different areas you want to improve on I understand that you get overwhelmed. It seems like you are trying or thinking about changing everything at once. And then you have this huge chunk in front of you and don't know where to start and all the experiences where you did not follow through, did not now how, etc. That is baby steps are important, even if they feel insignificant. Maybe if you don't find the energy to go into town you can put your shoes on and step outside the door and go back in if that is enough for the day. 

I agree that income,  social life and something that gives you meaning can improve how you feel about living. A job also doesn't only provide income but also a structure, colleagues, maybe contact with customers (although this might be stressful for you at first).

I think I get the part where you say you are afraid of everything. Your child part is looking for love and security while ""the world outside"" can seem uncertain and dangerous and thus your security system tells you that everything is potentially there to reject you or mistreat you like for example those bullies earlier in your life. 

You don't like being told that you did something wrong which i guess is related to the fear and looking for guidance, reassurance, love. It is not the being told that you did something wrong but the feeling that comes with it. Which is your conditioned automatic response. (please let me know if I go to much into teacher mode or so for your taste. It helps me at times if I get reflected my thoughts feelings.)


How is your ""I might do something stupid at 4am"" level at the moment? 

Do you know what something is that you would like to do either as a job/hobby/etc? Don't worry if you don't know. That is very possible because wanting is a feeling and if there is so much other stuff going on then it can be hard to feel what we want. 

You said that you never had a good time in your life. Does that mean you never felt joy, happiness, love, or similar even for a short amount of time ever? If you have felt some of them at some point in your life, what happened, what were you doing?"
SuicideWatch,f7nddlh,t1_f7moqnf,1573896929.0,"Would you like to have some assistance with getting a therapist? I was asking about that because we can talk and explore and all that. Yet change takes time and knowledge and I am not a professional. I guess that is why sometimes people here in the subreddit say that other people don't care or don't help when in reality they might be overwhelmed or busy with their own life and problems. I am not overwhelmed and I have some time for you :)

In your case maybe you need a therapist who is very in tune with his emotions so he or she can explain things to you. Especially if we didn't learn to feel ourselves properly it can be hard to express what we are feeling in the moment. There are many different therapists with different techniques and different pasts etc.

A friend of mine went to a healer recently who resolved her childhood trauma in a two hour session (according to her report). So it does not have to be a psychologist necesarily.

I get your first sentence, it might be my own. We experienced ourselves doing things that were not in our highest interest and we can remember it and at least sometimes we know that we knew better but we still acted differently. And yet if we look deep enough maybe we couln't act differently because we were overwhelmed with feelings and maybe feeling like a child and because of that our brain goes into survival mode and blocks the higher knowledge and uses what we have learned, fight, flight or freeze. I did not learn to fight till recently (referring to verbal fight as in standing up for myself) and used flight or freeze like yourself. It is not shameful and yet it feels bad because it feels like we are abandoning ourselves. At least it does for me. 


Since you are okay to talk about anything, what is something that you want to talk about?"
SuicideWatch,f7mcbct,t1_f7kz29w,1573859485.0,"I wish there were words that would heal your wounds in an instant. I am sorry that you are going through this and that people like your girlfriend at the time did not understand you properly. I assume that you feel like a child because even though on the outside you are grown up there is a part within you that is still the child and whos feelings are timeless and thus it feels like when you were a child. Especially when there are unresolved feelings that cause you to freeze and retreat because those are the coping mechanisms you learned as a child. 

There is regret in your words about missed opportunities. It also seems that when a freeze/regret situation happens that you are not using the most empowering self talk. Is that correct? I am not judging you for that, just wanting to know if it happens as I assume. If so I get it. You want to act differently and you know that you can if it wasn't for the overwhelming patterns. And you blame yourself. If that is true (and I might be wrong of course), you are doing your very best even if it doesn't feel like it. Like if you put a child on a football field that never played football before together with experienced players and noone would explain the rules and how to play. It most likely would feel confused and hit its toe while trying to shoot the ball, maybe hit an own goal while not understanding the negative reactions from other players. 

Have you ever seen a therapist or are you able to see one? Maybe you can find your very own ""football trainer"" who can train you to be your own trainer eventually. 

I've made a lot of assumptions here and like I said I might be wrong, just let me know what you think/feel. If you want this to go another direction, please tell me. And if you don't know where this should go because you don't feel it, we can explore the feeling of not knowing for example."
SuicideWatch,f7kixnc,t1_f7jfxke,1573812857.0,"Hearing about your situation it doesn' suprise me that you are not feeling on top of the world. You are missing personal connections in your life and you got bullied and had other experiences that left an impact. For example you say ""silly me"" for trying to overdose over a girl. But if you are alone and also feel like a child I can imagine that not getting the connection you are looking for can hurt so much that you are looking for a way to not feel that. 
From what I understand you didn't learn how to handle that yourself from anyone and now you could use someone to help you unravel the emotional package you are and have been carrying with you. If we have been emotionally negelected, especially at a young age we carry that with us but we can also learn to care for ourselves in a better way.

Is there anything specific you would like to express? Maybe you'd like to write about some experience you had or are having that you never talked about because of your ADD and anxiety barrier. 

Can you describe how it feels to feel like a child?"

I am glad that you folloed your ""stupid"" idea. Thank you for sharing your pain. Being stuck between fear and fear really sucks. What would you like to talk about? 

How old are you? Have you ever told anyone about your thoughts? Have you tried anything yourself? Did you get your basics checked (vitamin d for example, enough sleep, exercise etc)?

Just some questions we could use to get started and that would give me a bigger picture of yourself.

But we can start with anything like what you had for breakfast or so.

infp,eyyym00,t3_czjuhr,1567605300.0,"Dear Sammy,

somehow this post connected with my heart. Maybe it is the way you are writing, maybe it is the content and maybe it is also because I was/am in a kind of similar situtation. I think you already started working on yourself or how you expressed it becoming better, which I'd rather express as healing yourself because wanting to become better sounds like you aren't good/ok at the moment. 

There are some things not too clear in your post (at least to me). When you told him that the both of you aren't going to work out that sounds not too bad to me but honest and then he took you apart in his answer? Maybe I am getting it wrong?

What is it that you'd like to do now besides the healing aspect? Do you actually like him or do you still not see a chance of you both working out but you'd like to explain better why you behaved the way you did? 

You could send him your post for example or send him a letter yourself or a voice message or whatever. Explaining what you want to say the best you can even if it is not easy for you. Practice makes you better of course :) There might still be fear to do that but there is also your heart that wants to express itself properly. 

Theres something I've been recently told before and which I like to share with you (paraphrased). In the beginning there was only love. But when everything is love we can not see it, so God (or whoever made stuff) made fear so we could see/experience/feel the love. But by doing that both were real. And now we have a choice and even if it seems impossible because fear tells us what we cant do and what kind of bad things will happen, love can power through that one small or even big step at a time.

With your post you took one step and sent a message into the unknown. And then there will be new possible next steps you can take or also not take. 

I wish you all the best on your journey and much love <3"

= I am afraid of rejection(?)

Sharing your insecurites, traumas etc can push some people back, yes. It can also be a start to have a deep(er) connection with people. One has to do the first step, open up and be vulnerable (=real, authentic) while risking rejection and failure. 

It can be heart wrenching to open up, share your deepest feelings, sorrows, hopes, regrets and passions and then having the other person not appreciate that. Yet the other option is to always wear a mask and try to fit in isnt it?

How do you feel at the moment/today? :)"
InsightfulQuestions,eto49mf,t3_ccj1il,1563012943.0,"If you spent most or all of your time looking how you can make life enjoyable for others and cater for their needs it is normal to not know what you want because you haven't developed that area yet.  From what you posted so far on reddit it seems that you like nature, taking pictures, animals, being natural ;) and interaction with human beings. Of course thats just a very limited view based on a few posts on an internet forum. 

For your artistic endeavors where you say that you do not have a certain talent or you lost your talent it seems to me like you got ""The gap"" going  for you: https://vimeo.com/85040589

Learning takes time (I hate hearing and writing that...). For example you write that you can't just draw things like others an. I assure you there's noone or barely noone who can just draw without reference and such things without practicing for a long time. We are talking about things that are nice to look at I assume because I guess you are perfectly able to just draw a stick figure, or things like children do they just do. And funny enough I met a child once who drew a stegosaurus without a second thought and said that he couldn't draw a hand because that's too difficult :D

You've dabbled in the easy stuff and then met the gap (see above) where things get a little harder. The brain needs to be present and spend energy and attention and it might not want to do that or it might feel like self hatred for example and if you experience that outside of creative things than you might stop as well.

>Maybe I am just a lazy person, maybe I am unmotivated.

Maybe like you say you are in your head a lot and noone taught you how to feel yourself. Maybe theres some unresolved traume in your history (that doesnt need to be anything ""big"" necessarily, maybe one parent didn't give you the love and attention you needed, or you experienced rejection at a young age, etc.). There are activities like yoga, meditation, sport in general, therapy and more to get out of your brain and connect with your heart and feelings in general. 

Theres also no perfect answer (you can get from the outside) in my experience. Just people who made experiences, who have some but not all information about you, some impressions and their own history (the tell themselves/we tell ourselves). We can give each others inspiration, hints, observations but in the end only we can decide what's right for us. 

You can ask people who know you what they think you are good at. 
What is something where you loose a sense of time = flow?
What makes your soul sing? 
What would you like to try just because you find it interesting (glass blowing for example, maybe theres a chance to try it without too much effort and money involved to take the pressure off?)
Where do you find yourself wanting to improve (things other people do)?

There are many more questions like that. Maybe you don't have answers that resonate with you for now. Maybe theres too much emptiness for example then it might be helpful to tackle that first.

Do you love yourself?
