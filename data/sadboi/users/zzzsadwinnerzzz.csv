I feel for your mom but you sound like the dickhead. And you can’t just “climb” up in America. The schools in good neighborhoods are amazing with great teachers and resources. The bad neighborhoods have the opposite (20yr old books etc). It’s a system set up to keep the poor poor and rich rich. And black ppl have always since brought here like sardines on a ship been in the bad neighborhoods and oppressed, put their by the rich and powerful. And the system helps keep them there.

CPTSD,f2etymc,t3_dd80b2,1570203929.0,I think you need therapy not a relationship if u feel this way. The world won’t change for you. You need to get better so you can assimilate in it. I felt this way about my social anxiety that why won’t ppl just leave me alone that’s stupid they’re normal I’m not. I need to change. So I went into therapy now I function like a normal human instead of being at being pissed off at the world for not changing for me. Everyone is sexual and touchy that’s normal human traits. You not wanting that signifies you need to get help THEN when you’re better u can enter a relationship. No one deserves to be denied basic human needs from their partner like touch because you’re mentally ill from trauma. To me if you can’t enter the requirements of a healthy *equal* relationship then you shouldn’t be in one. Focus on yourself. At the end of the day that’s all that matters. You are the center of your own universe.
