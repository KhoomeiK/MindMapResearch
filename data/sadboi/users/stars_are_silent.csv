BipolarReddit,fqfnbr8,t3_gild96,1589328016.0,"I don't talk to my mom about it.  That's my solution.  Anytime I've ever brought up depression,  she recommends that I think happy thoughts on my commute, or take longer walks with my dog.  She also thinks medication is probably causing any problems that I have (""sometimes the side effects of all those medications are worse than what they are supposed to fix""). The last time it came up she suggested I might have a food sensitivity.  So, in the last 10 years, we've probably talked about my ""problems"" less than 10 times.  She doesn't even know I was diagnosed with bipolar.  

Anyways, all that to say - I love my mom.  She means well, but she is not helpful and she is not part of my support system as far as bipolar, etc.  

I have friends that I can talk to about it and I have a therapist.  I look to my mom for support about lots of other things, so it's not like she isn't there for me.  

For me, it's not worth damaging our relationship with hurt feelings and resentment over this.
