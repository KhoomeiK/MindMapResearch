It is only now that a diagnosis of autism is being investigated that I learned how harmful pushing myself to socialize, masking, and overdoing it have been. Throughout these seven years I have just tried to continue doing these things without giving myself a proper break from socializing and work.

I am socializing less, saying no more, practicing self-care, trying to have more compassion for myself. It's been helping a lot. And I am asking for adjustments at work to help me cope - reduced hours, and working from home.

Funny thing is, my best friend has autism, and I never realized how much masking she does until now. It's like we've been going through the same thing without knowing. 

I spoke to my psychiatrist about this yesterday, and she doesn't seem very knowledgeable about the subject.

For example, I usually force myself to seem chirpy and do a lot of socializing when in reality it is fucking exhausting and I just don't have the energy.

And I am exactly where you were... I've finally had to come to terms with the memories and feelings of being bullied and ostracized at school, all the confusing and awkward social encounters.

Most people think of themselves first or are self-absorbed. People are just too occupied with themselves and the image they portray to the world and can come across as uncaring or indifferent, when they're just...preoccupied with themselves.

BPD,fmac5o9,t3_fu1sod,1585889499.0,"I am exactly the same. I become obsessed, and it is all I can think about... I spend a lot of time thinking about the other person, looking at their social media, etc.

To me, it's also all or nothing. I couldn't bear to see them with someone else."
BPD,fm9xitf,t1_fm9wmcu,1585878811.0,"For me, it's because I need validation I think. It's like I only see the world through the eyes of others. I think it is related to identity disturbance. Something to work on for sure."
BPD,fm9nisi,t3_ftlw67,1585872402.0,"You're right. It is possible to identify so much with a diagnosis that you stop working on your symptoms but just accept them as the status quo.

Good to hear you are doing better."
BorderlinePDisorder,fm98ku0,t3_ftpbz7,1585863785.0,"I feel like that a lot...especially if I'm not acknowledged by anyone. Other people's attention make me feel like I exist.   


Or, for example, if I don't share something that happened to me, then it's as if it didn't happen."
BorderlinePDisorder,fm6o50u,t1_fm6nyoe,1585798701.0,"Oh, I'm so sorry. That must hurt. 

I'm just going to trust that everything is okay between me and my FP. Thanks for making me feel less alone. xo"
BorderlinePDisorder,fm63rqy,t1_fm5xm8h,1585785661.0,"Thank you. At least I've got work to keep me busy, even though I feel super emotional. Trying to be mindful and just let the emotions come and go..."
BPD,fm63o8l,t1_fm5z358,1585785604.0,"Thanks so much for your comment...

You're right. Intellectually I know that everything is probably fine, but emotionally I'm a mess.

I've thought about it, and I am trying to practice mindfulness and feel the anxiety / anger without acting on it, even though it is very tempting to split or ask for reassurance. Like you said, just let the emotions wash over me."
BorderlinePDisorder,fm62484,t1_fm3whly,1585784669.0,"Me too. A psychiatrist recently said I'm 'too pleasant' and I have long-term relationships, so I can't have BPD. This despite being diagnosed by a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and experiencing all 9 symptoms."
BPD,fm39y5a,t3_fsssp8,1585716859.0,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this.

I've been through something similar but within a friendship. When I distanced myself from my friend, I would think how manipulative he had been towards me and how egocentric he was. But then he'd be super nice and compliment me, and I'd wonder if I had just been oversensitive and then just blame myself.

What helped me was talking it over with a third party. My psychologist helped me see that my friend was indeed manipulating me and being selfish, and pointed out the unnecessary self-blame.

Happy to listen if you have any examples of his behavior to share."
BorderlinePDisorder,fm21hux,t3_fskdz4,1585688898.0,"My FP might have NPD. BPD and NPD is not a good combination. He triggers my fear of abandonment my disappearing without reason, or ignoring me all of the sudden. When I explain how this makes me feel, he uses anger and threats of leaving to manipulate me. That, interspersed with love bombing, has been our dysfunctional friendship. My psychologist has urged me to go no contact and that I'm in an abusive relationship. But I am finding it very hard to let go.... This has been one of the most intense relationships of my life.
Ps. Not trying to diss those w NPD. Just not a good combo w BPD."
BPD,fm20hm6,t1_fm0pbr9,1585688362.0,"You haven't met this person, so you wouldn't be able to say whether they had NPD traits or not."
BPD,flzx6br,t1_flzvagg,1585636508.0,"Quiet borderline here, and I experience the same thing."
BPD,flzt2x5,t3_fs73p1,1585632716.0,"My FP probably has narcissistic personality disorder, but I am unsure. Even if he doesn't have it, his behavior really triggers my fear of abandonment, and sometimes he uses anger and love bombing to manipulate me.I have ended our friendship several times, especially when I was splitting. A few days later I feel horrible about it and miss him, so I always go back. It's a dysfunctional relationship. :/

Edit: I don't mean to diss people with NPD. I just think he many NPD traits, which don't go well with my BPD traits."
BPD,flz6824,t1_flz641v,1585616420.0,Yep. This article says it better than I can... [https://themighty.com/2017/09/borderline-personality-disorder-favorite-person-best-friend/](https://themighty.com/2017/09/borderline-personality-disorder-favorite-person-best-friend/)
BPD,flyy05k,t1_flytjtj,1585611409.0,Thank you so much. I'll try that.
BPD,flyxwa9,t1_flytfpy,1585611345.0,Thank you for your suggestions and kind words. I managed to practice a few skills to the point where I'm calmer. I'll call the helpline if I need to today.
BPD,flyxh7y,t1_flyt9n5,1585611101.0,"Thank you for your comment... Although I'm sorry to hear you go through this too.

Can you describe what you do to work on yourself in moments like these?"
BPD,flywuoy,t1_flyuj8v,1585610732.0,"Thank you for the supportive words.
No, I don't need to be on social media for work luckily. It's probably not the ideal time to do it (with isolation and so forth) but I just can't handle spending hours on it anymore, and feeling shit when I don't get the validation I want.
I have reached out to another friend, who didn't respond. Lol. 
I thought about telling my FP how I feel but I think that will only make me feel worse... At least I didn't act on that impulse."
BPD,flytinu,t3_frzxio,1585608798.0,"I'm sorry to hear about how awful this last week has been for you. I can't imagine what you went through.

There have been times when my BPD was totally out of control, especially during stressful periods in my life. I made threats and was super raw and sensitive 90% of the time. I hurt a lot of people. (TBH I'm going through the same thing right now.) But I did get better and was in remission for a year or two (didn't meet all the criteria anymore). It does pass. 

You've been through a lot... Try be kind to yourself. It sounds like your bf is supportive and reassuring, which is good. 

Hope you feel better soon."
BPD,flyswor,t3_fs0mxw,1585608448.0,"I feel broken too, and like nothing is okay. I don't know how to deal tbh.

You're not alone."
BPD,flyjpfz,t3_fryt6t,1585603428.0,Sorry to read this. Rejection from especially an FP hurts. Just today I have had a meltdown because of my FP. Hope you can find some peace today. You're not alone.
BPD,flyg1mz,t3_frq21d,1585601481.0,"Oh, I feel you.

Just this morning I had a text convo with my FP and they just disappeared. It made me feel absolutely horrible, and I've been thinking my messages must be incredibly boring and stupid. It's so hard just having online interactions."
BPD,flw4uag,t1_flw4k37,1585539688.0,"I'm happy to hear it improved for you with time. I feel like mine is getting worse, lol. It feels like it is like a reflex - I do it before I am even aware of it. I'm revisiting my DBT so hopefully that helps."
BPD,flw3u58,t1_flw2ajl,1585538943.0,"I tell myself to stop all the time, but wow, it is so hard not too. I wouldn't be surprised if you can be addicted to approval. Because I feel like I am."
BPD,flvjtb5,t3_framg2,1585525372.0,All. The. Time. Especially if I feel rejected. But a few days after deactivating my socials and isolating myself I regret my decision.
BPD,fltprjx,t3_fqtjnh,1585482994.0,"I too think I have symptoms from various disorders... I am diagnosed w bipolar, OCD, GAD and BPD. I'm currently being evaluated for ADHD. I'm pretty sure I have symptoms of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and C-PTSD too. There are so many overlapping symptoms... it's hard to untangle it all...and find 'me' in there.

I totally get what you are saying about the diagnosis giving you a sense of stability. For me a diagnosis helps validate my pain, and gives me a way to explain to my friends and family what I'm going through. 

It's awful when professionals don't take you seriously. Sorry you have to deal w this."
BPD,flmoep6,t3_fpr809,1585290244.0,"I can relate! If the feeling is very intense, it's hard to shift my attention away from it, and I emotionally detach from the conversation."
BPD,flmo6j9,t3_fpji72,1585290005.0,"I sometimes have paranoia that everyone laughs at me behind my back, talks about me, or hates me. In the yoga class the other day, I was paranoid that she was brainwashing me while she did a guided relaxation. Or I'll think that the person behind me in fitness class is controlling my movements. I have bipolar disorder too - so am not always sure which paranoia is BPD and which is bipolar. I guess BPD paranoia is more related to people and their perception of us...not sure."
