I spent YEARS playing with crochet, making things and then frogging them, before I had a  first project. I liked the act but was not satisfied with a finished project. My first projects were hats and fruit coasters (not pictured on reddit because I didn't have it then). I made the jump from hats to super complex doilies pretty quickly. Again, it was one of my first projects, but it had taken me years of perfecting my technique and playing w yarn to get there and I was super proud. Unless it is a blatant repost or stolen pic, let the people have their fun. It could be their first post to reddit ot it could genuinely be their first project. 

Now, I will down vote the irl lady who once sniffed at me derisively because after years of pretty much only doilies and DC blankets, I forgot how to make a granny square. Said lady only made granny squares. It was unnecessarily mean. 

Instead, start posting things that aren't perfectly squared or crafted if you want to start seeing more realistic work. Up vote those things more and ignore the other things. No need to down vote people even if you're not quite sure if it's really a first project."

The other one is that the au (caught) hasn't merged with the o (cot) sound unlike in mn so they still carry a distinct phoneme/sound difference (just off the top of my head from linguistic classes back in Madison). There are other differences, again subtle but there, in intonation, certain word choices, and even choices in phrasing for speach politeness.
