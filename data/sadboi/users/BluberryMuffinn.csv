I personally wish people would stop assuming it's just an ""excuse"". It honestly makes me feel guilty bringing up my issues when I'm struggling with something because of it, or when I start my rocking and fidgeting. I've seen similar things happen to autistic people, such as my own friends. Belittled for shit like that because it's not ""natural"" and there's ""no reason"" for it. Just having extra visible energy gets people's panties in a twist. People need to accept we're gonna be doing things like talking to ourselves, fidgeting with anything we get our hands on, needing ""toys"" for fidgeting and comfort items. Schools should honestly have a lesson or two on mental health and all so people can actually learn early on that there's gonna be people like this, instead of setting them loose with no idea to torment and taunt those deemed ""not normal"".

I don't even care. I got to actually enjoy being young.
