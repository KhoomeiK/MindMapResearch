He was annoying, bless his little soul. I always told myself I wasn't going to give medication to my happy child if he was doing well in school (he always did), just to make him sit still.

But the minute I found out he started being bullied because of his ways, it was straight to medication. It was like night and day. He's a lot more restrained, relaxed, can listen to the other kids, doesn't come out as bossy and grumpy anymore.

That was 1.5 ys ago and now he has a pretty cool group of 5-6 kiddos who regularly hang out, and he's really part of the gang.

Moral of the story: the child's feelings are also a reason to medicate, even if the academic performance is sufficient."

I'm a doctor (but I stopped practising some time ago) asking on behalf of my former coworkers in a latin american country.

The lack of PPE over there is outrageous. I have read bad stuff about many countries, but my home country is one of the worst. My friend works in a small town (8000 people) hospital and they've been given 3 (THREE) tests and THIRTY N95 masks... and been told that's it, make them last...

I live in another country (central Europe) where this is not even an issue, and the reality of my friends over there makes me want to cry.

They are making their own face shields with plastic out of PET bottles or folders. I'm afraid the trash bags idea will be **welcomed** there.

I've read about resterilizing cloth masks and gowns. Is that a possibility? Is it safe? What about wearing rubber boots, wouldn't they be easy to disinfect with wipes?

I found [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fmoffm/recycling_of_single_use_ppe_through_timedelay_or/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here, which they found extremely helpful. Any other ideas?

I have so many questions about how to help them, and I'd be very grateful for any creative answer from anyone who is already through this. Thank you!"

I want to remind you all that on those who are younger than 60, and are healthy, the probability of complications and death from covid-19 is quite low.

Your exposed friends and relatives will very likely be alright.

So keep calm, carry on, and let's keep looking out for each other and protecting the vulnerable. Let's keep supporting each other and don't let the panic set in. We can do it!! üí™üí™"

Plus, many countries have a ""fianc√®e visa"" for when you are planning your wedding, that extend your stay beyond the 3 months of the tourist visa. I thought it strange that they marry with just a civil ceremony, because I believed it would be ""frowned upon"" to sleep together if the marriage was not temple-official. 

I didn't understand why the rush to get married without even her close family with her, if it didn't change their ""sex rules"". :("

If someone has, say, an appendicitis, but they don't get surgery fast enough because all ventilators are occupied with Covid19 patients, they may end up with a peritonitis. From there to sepsis there is a short step, and then they can't be transferred to ICU because there are no beds, and so there you have it, a death caused indirectly by Covid19 without being positive for the virus."

No. I don't. I like them as patients, they are more interesting than grown ups. But I only have to see them 20 minutes in my office, and they leave.

But for some reason, I'm really popular with them, which is the total decider. Apparently I don't scare them, quite the contrary, they are cool with me. I'm that type of person to whom babies smile between the seats on the plane.

breakingmom,flfx308,t1_flf2o9b,1585121223.0,"I agree. I met a delightful lady/s who had 2 sets of twins and 1 single in the middle. The older twins were taken by the father's family and moved to ::country in South America:: with him. She lived from social help, and asked money to everyone with her sob story. That she missed the twins so much. She just had moved to our town, so I agreed her middle daughter would play with my daughter (we speak Spanish and I thought we were helping)

Then slowly you got so see the signs... heating so high in winter, that the little ones were running around in diapers. Permanently manicured fake nails. The last model of mobile. Expensive hair treatments. Another mobile (two?) ""Cousins"" from her country visiting all the time and staying for weeks. Then one ""cousin"" became a ""friend"" then the kid told my daughter it was her ""uncle"", and later she was calling him ""papi"".

By then he was responsible of waking the kids and bring them to school. He was living in their appartment, off her social help. Then she got a gym membership (in a fancy gym, mind you) and started driving a share car (like a rent car  only for short periods of time). I guess smeone reported her. She had become quite a persona-non-grata in the small town, so she got really mad and aggresive with everyone. Then her girl stole money from a classmate, and that was the last we saw of them. Packed the kids, the ""Uncle Papi"" and left town the day before end of term without leaving any contact number and obviously without paying shit to any of the neighbours who helped her.

I feel so sorry for the kiddos :(
