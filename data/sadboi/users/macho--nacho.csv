AskReddit,f0vbzhh,t3_d6hyci,1568975501.0,"There was this guy-duo in my middle school who were a bully to everyone, lets call em Abe and Riz. Abe was the type of bully who was straight up an asshole and physically agressive to pretty much everyone, especially to the girls for some reason. The popular kids kept him around so they dont get beaten up. Riz on the other hand, was an absolute ass-kisser of Abe. He pretty much followed him everywhere he goes and picked up few of Abe's behavior himself. 

One day, as i was exiting the faculty office, me and few other students heard a really loud crack and laughter coming from the hallway. We went there and saw Abe was laughing real hard by the opened window, face all red, while looking down and ponting to the basketball yard just outside. 

You see we were on the second floor, and the basketball yard was right on the first floor by our window. So when we looked down below to where he was pointing, we saw Riz. Half laying down in a weird position. 

The way his legs bent didnt look quite right. 

It didnt take long for the teachers to come and for the rest of students to crowd. Apparently Abe goaded Riz to jump from the second floor for shit and giggles, it was unclear whether Riz jumped himself or Abe pushed him off. Everyone absolutely avoided Abe after the whole incident. He got expelled moved away few months after that. No one heard from him again. Riz on the other hand, walked on a limp for few months though at that point the popular kids already lost interest on him and never included him again.

Edit: sorry for the grammar, english is not my first language"

I feel the same way dating my current girlfriend, there are lots of time i could tell where she got overwhelmed by my episodes. I can't help but to think constantly these days about breaking up with her since it feels like its inevitable. I love her, but i hate seeing her so stressed out whenever im not in the right state of mind. I hate seeing her scared of me. I wish i could be a more cheerful person or just brighter in general for her."

depression,eob58nr,t3_bqz1fi,1558435365.0,"I do too, it feels like i have nothing to lose either way. Whether im still here, or gone, it wouldnt make much of a difference. I know this sounds selfish of me, but i hate the fact that if i do kill myself i feel like i'll be blamed instead for their misery.. 

I don't want to kill myself to spite people, i just want to stop existing. Yet i feel like i'll always be blamed if i do.. even though, really, i'm just tired"
