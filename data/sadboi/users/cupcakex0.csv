My dad, step-mom, me, and my step-brothers, and different years one of my friends would go to FL for Spring break. Pretty much every year my step-mom would throw one of her temper tantrums and rage at me (she suffers from BPD or some sort of personality disorder). Other years, I would have mental health problems. When I was 14, a week or so after my birthday I was admitted to a local mental hospital for self-mutilation/depression. In my early 20s, I was forced to attend an out-patient drug program (I do smoke weed and the root issue is not using marijuana, but anxiety that was never truly acknowledged by my parents). This year, my aunt’s dog who I cared for often and loved dearly was put to sleep. Not to mention, I don’t like the attention my birthday brings.

Additionally, the right and moderates generate false outrage then blame PoC and LGBT+ for the false outrage.

I know people who eat similarly to me, or drink 10 Cokes a day (I drink 1-2 depending on the day) but never gain weight or barely gain anything. I have always had issues with food and body image. I feel like if I don’t do something soon I’m going to go downhill, fast. Not to brag, but I do have a pretty face but my double almost triple chin is not doing me any favors. I think therapy should be part of a weight loss journey because issues with food stem from issues in other areas of our lives (not speaking for everyone but there is a strong correlation). Personally, food is an outlet for me. Combine that with an addictive personality and depression; it’s a disaster. I can literally feel how the extra weight is affecting my body now. I can’t reach as far or do as much physically now. However, we are resilient creatures. We just have to realize we’re worth more and deserve to live a healthy life. Good luck to you <3"

I was throwing out a question to see if anyone has experienced this as well. It was meant to  fish for similar experiences of those who believe in reincarnation. To relate on some level. NDEs are something I can’t speak about as I have not experienced one or known many people who have, and they sure do complicate things when discussing the afterlife; because who knows if it’s the brains reaction or a legitimate spiritual experience. I like to read about them, and love the OA (Netflix show). I like the OA’s take on afterlife experiences and dimensional travel.

Edit: added more to first sentence"
pastlives,f8euy09,t1_f8eui7z,1574534171.0,If anything Jesus was like Buddha. I’ve heard the years that he’s not accounted for in the Bible that he could have traveled to the Far East to learn Buddha’s teachings.
pastlives,f8eurek,t1_f8equrt,1574534063.0,"I said what I said at the beginning of my post because NO ONE has a for sure answer about what happens after we die. Yes, and I added that to give everyone the full extent of my experience when it happened. I can see how that seems contradictory."
pastlives,f8eryom,t1_f8du0sm,1574532660.0,"That’s really interesting. I believe my mom’s family is part of my soul cluster because I feel very connected to my aunts. I’ve been told my mom was my daughter in another life. I do think this lifetime might be the last being so closely connected with her. I think we’re trying to work out some karma because our relationship has always been strained. And, I’ve been told by multiple psychics that I was a nun in a past life. That may be where my disgust with Catholicism/Christianity comes in; I believe I was forced into it because of negative circumstance. Also, I believe that’s why I enjoy my solitude now. Who knows though, we might all be nuts lol. Then again I kind of feel things deeply so idk"
pastlives,f8er4l4,t1_f8dxbqx,1574532397.0,"I think on some level it started out as “good” but all of the things you listed are just common sense and even in the biblical era I think there were many other factors that probably made people act in fear. Like, did people magically start acting “better” after the Ten Commandments were written? Probably to an extent, but it’s fucked up and just as fucked up now that people think they’re moral and “good” solely because they claim Jesus as their Lord and Savior."
pastlives,f8equsn,t1_f8eogiv,1574532248.0,"I just hate when people use Jesus to justify shitty behavior. Logically I know on an individual level Christians aren’t horrible people, but systemically it’s awful"
pastlives,f8eqoja,t1_f8edz7e,1574532150.0,"Oh I definitely agree that Christianity has been twisted to fit a Western narrative. I think if anything Jesus was trying to spread good will and could have very well been angel or some sort of being from another planet universe. I think it’s awesome you believe in many things. Christianity, at least how we know it in the present, is something I could never get into."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f4e1pxk,t3_dkc340,1571550776.0,This happens to me so often. Things click and go off at the same time.. it’s kind of hard to explain but it’s very similar to your experience. Like everything is in synch.
Psychic,f49l9w1,t1_f49int6,1571472064.0,True true. I normally don’t have super specific questions or whatever. I told her I wanted a general type of reading because I didn’t have anything particular needing attention.

Empaths,f1ac2h8,t1_f1a9p09,1569290121.0,"Same. Haha, right? I’m fairly intuitive. I wouldn’t mind getting a spiritual download that includes the Powerball numbers. I question my intuition a lot, but I think I’m more intuitive than I put on and believe. I just feel weird talking about it even though many people I know are interested in and  believe in “abilities” to an extent. Really glad I don’t see dead people, though. Eek. I saw a ghost when I was 8 and it terrified me."
Empaths,f1aboya,t1_f1aaf2o,1569289854.0,"I understand a person should remain skeptical (even as a believer in the spiritual and paranormal, I always do because 98% of the time it’s explainable), but things have happened to me in the past that I have to believe there is SOMETHING. The universe, whatever. I see triple and quadruple numbers fairly often. I’ll begin to doubt things and myself then shit that is too weird to be a coincidence happens. 11:11 is supposedly an “angelic” number and spirit is present in your life. Who really knows, though."

TrueOffMyChest,f0umpp6,t1_f0rkjo7,1568944835.0,"I wish my mom was like that when I was growing up. Constantly criticized what I ate. Mind you, the selection at home was Lean Cuisines, noodles, saltine crackers, cheese, wheat bread, deli lunchmeat, Diet Pepsi with lime, Frosted mini-wheats, salsa, peanut butter, and if they (her and my step-dad) were feeling wild: ice cream. My step-dad had a stash of mini Snickers occasionally. So her constantly trying to monitor what I ate had the *opposite* effect. I’d go to friends’ houses and eat their “junk” food in excess. I had to shamefully eat “bad foods” in my room or be embarrassed to eat in front of other people. Never could buy anything at the grocery without their approval. Because, god forbid your child learn self-regulation and moderation on their own terms. Fat shaming is another issue, though. Kinda feel like people who don’t have disordered eating or weren’t the “fat friend” growing up will have no empathy towards this subject. Ever."

questions,f09yfbd,t3_d4480i,1568508503.0,"If you’re getting an Associate’s Degree, then yes, it’s possible. A Bachelor’s? Not so much. Maybe if you decide on a field that requires only a certification, then it’s possible you could finish in a year and a half. It also depends on how many general education credits (if any) for your specific degree. You can always try to test out of the basic level classes for like say English or Math, which would help reduce the number of general education classes needed. A lot of this rides on your major/field. Sometimes you need practicum hours, too."
childfree,f08mveb,t3_d455se,1568483901.0,"You don’t need to explain yourself! F everyone else. There’s women who WANT children for selfish reasons: 

1) They want someone to “take care of them when they get old” (as if that’s a guarantee, especially in the U.S.)

2) They want someone to love them because they feel like no one else does

3) They think children are accessories

4) They want to continue their bloodline

5) They only want another child while their partner doesn’t and they get pregnant on purpose (seen this irl, a friend actually)

So, breeders are just as “selfish” as the childfree."
childfree,f05hdk3,t1_f04gt98,1568409809.0,"I used to work at my state’s humane society. You would be surprised by how many people feel like they’re entitled to an animal. Old ladies would get mad at me when the smaller dogs would be adopted, even though they never put a 24 hour hold on the animal. It’s really not complicated and I would explain our policies multiple times; no hold on the specific animal you want to possibly adopt? Too bad then, it’s first-come first-served. If you deny someone an adoption, then it’s a whole other ordeal. There’s no real way to deny someone if you think they’re too broke (with no proof, because they don’t ask to provide proof of income, etc.) to afford an animal, but usually it would end up that some of these people would return the animal to our care. Not being able to provide for an animal is the reason why I haven’t adopted another pet yet. I’ve seen  it on Facebook too many times: person adopts pet they KNOW they can’t afford, tries to give it away, gives it up to someone or the pound, months later they adopt another pet- repeat. It’s always the same trashy people, too. Don’t get me started on people who sell animals on Craigslist."
