I changed plenty of time between the ages of 18-22, eventually you do find yourself, and will continue to do so for the rest of your life. Just food for thought"

IWantToLearn,fmsat0c,t3_fx3mp2,1586351324.0,"Practice by talking, listening more to others, giving pretend speeches, or by writing out your thoughts in a journal. I’ve also learned to realize that most really good public speakers articulate themselves in a slower speech pattern than others. They tend to mess up less, but that is just my generalization. My job requires a lot of communication and articulation so I am sitting right next to you on this boat. Hope I could be of help"

There is no guarantee that things will ever get better, or get worse, but the only thing we can guarantee ourselves is that we will fucking fight through this pain. Each day I wake up I tell myself I refuse to allow myself to succumb to my demons. That i refuse to quit, and refuse to lose. A lot of people hate motivational stuff but I feed off of it. I just hope maybe you gain a better perspective on how to attack each battle moving forward. Good luck friend."
SuicideWatch,fjzdudy,t3_ffhnd3,1583717400.0,"It’s going to get better. Last June I was in a similar position as you. I had applied to hundreds of jobs, I don’t think I received more than a few answers. This was humiliating to me, all the hard work i had put in over the past couple of years had seemed worthless now. Under pressure, I took a minimum wage job as a stock boy at a liquor store even though i had a college degree. I struggled immensely and pondered the same questions that you face. I stuck it out, with blind faith that things would improve. 4 months later I had gotten myself back on my feet and have a job that is much more in tune with my degree of expertise. If I had done what i wanted to do last June, I would’ve robbed myself of the only opportunity to pull myself out from under the rocks. You are a fighter, stick this out because even the stormiest of seas will eventually calm."
SuicideWatch,fjr9gnj,t1_fjqms6f,1583582995.0,"“Real” depression as you refer to it as, is a type of clinical depression such as major depressive disorder. Clearly those who suffer from a chemical imbalance or some other type of depression would obviously feel those affects more. But what you fail to comprehend is that depression can also derive from many other sources such as traumatic events, deaths, tragedy, and other common live events. You don’t necessarily have to have a clear cut illness to know what depression feels like. And no offense, but usually depressed people are more altruistic than the way you come off."

I’m hopeless a lot. But for some reason I just feel compelled to keep fighting so that I can prove wrong all those that doubted me. You will find your light, just please don’t think that it will come by ending your own life. But please, please don’t hurt yourself again."

    “A permanent end to my suffering? You know, one of the biggest reasons why people kill themselves?”

We all suffer, in extremely varying ways, but a permanent end to our suffering means a permanent end to everything as we know. Watch a YouTube video about the survivors of Golden Gate Bridge jumpings. It puts into perspective about the other side of suicide we don’t usually consider. A permanent end to everything."

Each time I truly thought about the logistics of my suicide, cleaning out my room so that my roommates wouldn’t have to deal with my parents showing up was the last thing I’d always plan for myself. I’m hoping you don’t do it but just know you truly are a good person."

SuicideWatch,fjeew4o,t1_fjeeqzv,1583270625.0,"Through my experiences, abusers just want to control their significant others. They want them to do exactly as they say because of how insecure they are. They’ll always bring you down to their level so they cannot look like the bad guy."

Then all you become is the very thing that you set out to destroy."

SuicideWatch,fjcstf0,t1_fjcc401,1583235271.0,"I just got out of an abusive relationship a little over a month ago and it’s really hard to feel strong again. When you have a certain way of life for so long that you grow accustomed to, it’s insane to think any other way. I believed for so long that I was the bad guy and always doing something wrong. I began to start critiquing myself in the same harsh manner that they did. I began to self-destruct, just wading through life because what was being done to me was breaking down my character. When it finally ended I felt so relieved. I couldn’t break up with her because of the punishment she’d dole out in return, but I took advantage of her constantly throwing the relationship out the window before she could reel me back in. I just feel numb and the fact that even after, I am still feeling the affects from the abuse, makes it tough to truly be happy now a days."

SuicideWatch,fjbox2v,t1_fjbnicb,1583198201.0,"I am a bit of a hypocrite in this situation. The fact of the matter is that I’ve been treated like such shit, that I’d easily be willing to give my life in order to save even a random person. It’s my fire escape. I have fantasized lately about saving someone else but dying doing so, because it’s more honorable than taking my own life. The opportunity to sacrifice myself so that others may live is the only thing that keeps me going sometimes. It’s the only way I’d want to truly go out."
