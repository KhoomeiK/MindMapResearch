- chop some grape tomatoes in half and throw them in. cover with a lid on low heat for a few minutes just until the tomatoes get soft.
- smash the tomatoes lightly with your spoon just so they can release their juices. throw in chopped mushrooms. I used cremini but we don‚Äôt discriminate here. 
- season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes! Toss in your cooked pasta - used fettuccini here - and give it a good toss / twirl all together. 

- lastly, add a handful of spinach. let the heat wilt it slowly and gently toss it in all together. you have yourself a simple, healthy dinner :)"

day 1:

day 2:
- do the same - add 50g of fresh water and 50g of fresh flour to the existing starter and mix well.


day 3:
- remove 50g of starter and place into a fresh jar. then add 50g water and 50g starter. discard whatever remained from the original starter. 


day 4:
- do they same as day 3. this is where it says it SHOULD start smelling sour.

im on day 2. and thank you for the tip!"
