TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f4p30yf,t3_dkp6lk,1571714591.0,Getting a better hair straightener really is the key. I have a hot tools straightener that was an investment but so worth it. It quickly straightens my hair and it stays straight for days.
needadvice,f2z6iuy,t1_f2z6bhw,1570508090.0,I pay my tuition with financial aid and my own money.
college,f2yxhik,t3_cwufdh,1570500797.0,I’m considering dropping down to part time for medical reasons and filing a refund form for the classes that I’ll drop. My only problem is is that I still need money for on campus housing as I live here year round usually.  I know I’ll have less than what I have now but how much could I see to lose? Obviously not looking for a number amount but want to know if it’d put me in danger.

subway,etm7ab4,t3_cccpv1,1562953588.0,People just do it because it’s free and adds bulk to the sandwich. Unless it’s a veggie sub it’s really excessive
subway,etm3azj,t3_cbwgu6,1562951123.0,You never get an official break. I close at my store and we prep in the morning so if it’s slow and not time to clean you can sit or eat. I’ve also had coworkers ask me if it was ok with me if they take a quick break. It all depends on the dynamics of your store. If you ever need a break you could always just sit in the bathroom for a bit.
subway,es2ijur,t3_c4jsnw,1561525618.0,"I have one coworker who

-tried to send me home early despite having a lower position than me in the store, and freaks out when I say I’m gonna finish my hours
- interrogates people on why they clocked in 2 minutes late
- stands over me while I make my own sandwich 
- tells me I look tired without makeup
- acomplishes literally nothing besides dishes and pretending to be the manager when nobody else is around"

college,erb3nwr,t1_erb3513,1560660566.0,I go to ETSU which is  pretty conservative but it’s not religious
EatingDisorders,er4hhft,t3_c0d7hy,1560492099.0,I just avoid looking in the mirror for longer than I have to. It’s really helpful to keep a jacket that’s oversized and lightweight enough so you can cover up when things get really bad without overheating. It’s not the best solution but it gets me out of the house on bad days
