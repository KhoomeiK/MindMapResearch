TheBluePill,fr3lb75,t1_fr3br9i,1589859919.0,"They’ve done research to find out if playing violent video games makes one more inclined to be violent, and the general consensus is that they don’t, or that there isn’t enough evidence to prove that they do. This isn’t the case with porn- many studies have shown that it negatively affects people’s intimate relationships, their sex drive/ability to perform, and with men, their perception of women. 

I think the difference is that the gratification that porn gives (orgasm) is a much stronger form of gratification than killing people in a video game. Like other addictive things such as alcohol, gambling, drugs, etc. watching porn releases a lot of dopamine that not only makes you want to watch it more, but also makes you seek out more extreme content, similar to how you can form a tolerance for drugs or alcohol and have to consume more to feel the same effects. Violence in video games doesn’t seem to have the same effect, although gaming addiction is definitely a thing."

I think for a lot of people seeing a university counselor is less intimidating than going directly to the police, as many victims are afraid that they won’t be believed or that police intervention will provoke retaliation from the attacker. Talking to the police is really scary tbh- I never did go to the police to report my assault because the thought of it made me physically sick.

I think this also says a lot about male entitlement in general. When men don’t find women attractive, women are held responsible for not meeting impossible beauty standards and often blame themselves for not being good enough. When women don’t find men attractive, they act like it’s literally a misandristic hate crime to turn down a man for a shallow reason such as his height.

FemaleDatingStrategy,fpbq8c7,t3_gccl51,1588476010.0,"Ah my most recent ex was like this, but almost worse because he would intentionally try to embarrass me while (unknowingly) embarrassing himself in the process. Like with toilet humor and general grossness. He kept asking me why I didn’t introduce him to my friends, and because I kept avoiding the subject he decided that I had no friends and made fun of me for that, too. 

Literally one of the worst guys I’ve ever dated, I shouldn’t have to elbow him and give him “looks” to stop him from making an ass of himself in public, like I’m corralling a mouthy toddler. Breaking up with him was very fun and the whole thing actually led me to this subreddit to finally grow a backbone."

PinkpillFeminism,fozux3a,t3_gafvro,1588197301.0,"Women do have more of an opportunity to abuse children, given that the majority of childcarers and single parents are women... but the stats show they don’t. Men are much less likely to be involved with raising children than women, yet they abuse children in much higher rates than women, especially sexual abuse. But of course, we’re not allowed to say that because it’s miSaNdRy"

TrueOffMyChest,fowhshy,t3_g9m3ak,1588120042.0,"The right doesn’t give a shit about rape. They laughed it off when 23 women came forward saying Trump sexually abused them and told them they should have reported it 20 years ago, or that he was just exhibiting masculine behavior, or that they’re lying because he’s rich. They don’t suddenly care about rape because a Democrat raped someone. They just realize that this will further alienate Americans from the DNC and ensure another 4 years of Trump, and that on the off chance he does manage to win, the Dems will never live down the fact that they nominated and elected a senile, drooling rapist who sniffs little girls and slips his hand under women’s skirts."

offmychest,foqhzr7,t3_g8xvoh,1587994005.0,"It’s pretty common for abuse survivors to fall into a pattern of abusive relationships, because that’s what they’re used to. I’m not saying you were/are being abused, but if you’ve only ever been with toxic people, you don’t see the red flags. They seem normal until it’s too late. 

I have the same problem after being in an abusive long-term relationship. I’m drawn to people who share traits with my ex- narcissistic, manipulative, selfish, people who take more than they give, people who hide their true intentions. My latest relationship was with someone who was much the same way, but I ignored my gut feeling and put up with an incredible amount of horseshit. Until I realized that I was incredibly unhappy and this man gave me nothing except the fucking audacity. I dumped him and he never saw it coming. He wouldn’t leave me alone either, and I had to put up with multiple angry and manipulative texts/phone calls before I blocked him. 

That guy was basically the straw that broke the camel’s back. It’s not that I don’t trust other people anymore, it’s more that I can’t trust my own judgement of people. I’ve decided to remain single until I get my head sorted out and learn how to respect myself enough to choose decent people to be in my life. 

I know therapy isn’t an option for everyone, but therapy taught me how to realize when someone is bad news and end it tactfully before the shit hits the fan. Think about the traits that all of these toxic people share, and write them down. Then you have a clear-minded reference for what you don’t want in a partner that you can look back to if you aren’t sure about a person. You deserve better, so you should raise the bar higher and set firm boundaries. I hope this helps lol, it sounds like we have similar problems."
offmychest,foqfmvy,t1_foq40ua,1587992419.0,"I think some of it is just their mind getting soft with age. Elderly people with early signs of dementia often lack impulse control and lose their filter. I’ve had old people in my family say completely out of pocket things to me that no one who was really all there would say. 

We shouldn’t have to just lay down and take it, I think it’s perfectly reasonable to tell a boomer when they’re being rude, even if they get offended and tell you to respect your elders. But after a certain point it’s probably fruitless to tell them when it doesn’t really register and they won’t remember it after a day or so."
