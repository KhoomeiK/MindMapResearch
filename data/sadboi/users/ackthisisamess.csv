My reliance on the bathroom could also partially  be a mental thing though, because I used to have very scary and painful experiences due to stomach ulcers and it sort of traumatized me in a way. 
Thank you, this makes me feel hopeful."
ARFID,fdh0r3b,t3_ekzvi6,1578412863.0,At my current treatment program I need to be taking in a ridiculous amount of calories to gain weight. They have been giving me something called scandishake that really packs everything in. The downside is that its sickly sweet and makes me feel nauseous at times but the upside is you only need to drink a very small amount to get in a lot of nutrition.
ARFID,fdh05bh,t1_fdgzfq3,1578412479.0,"Thank you for the reply, its validating to know that someone has experienced similar. I was also once misdiagnosed with anorexia and it was a very difficult time. Basically, the program here doesn't like to make exceptions because then it can become unfair. I personally don't see it as ""exceptions"", but rather personalizing treatment so everyone gets the most out of it."
ARFID,fdcda26,t3_d86k9o,1578272098.0,"I'm currently in an inpatient program and also feel frustrated by some of these weird rules. For example, we aren't allowed to use the toilet until an hour after a meal. A lot of my problem comes from the fact that I'm scared to get a stomachache / feel nauseous so this rule makes me super anxious and feel very sick. I really wish that these programs specialized treatment for each individual."
introvert,f8rniyz,t1_f78rqqb,1574745755.0,"Thank you!! I personally like Haruki Murakami David Mitchell and now Stephen King. However, I'm really open to trying new books and generally I enjoy them. I'm currently reading House of Leaves, and I'm about to read the Great Gatsby for educational purposes. I already read it once, but absorbed very little, so I'm going to give it another go haha. I would really appreciate some more reccomendations, if you have the time! Thanks!"

Anxiety,f77jaix,t3_dubotu,1573459453.0,"THIS! I try to just ignore it when it happens and avoid associating it with anxiety. This works for me personally, as dwelling on things and overthinking makes everything a million times more difficult. I usually find a distracting but fun activity to do when this happens, like reading a book or doodling. Sorry if this is unhelpful advice for you, just stating stuff that has worked for me, personally. 

Anyway, I hope you have a good, anxiety-free day / night :)"
ibs,f77j29x,t3_dungez,1573459117.0,"I think I experience something similar during very rough times with my stomach issues. I will start shaking violently and become very hot, and my thoughts become weird, ""trippy"" and irrational. I remember distinctly I once had this happen and I started dreaming about birds falling out of trees... ok brain.

Often, I would begin to throw up when this would happen, but I think I've learned to control that, to a certain extent, at this point."
ibs,f77ivyb,t3_dumkzc,1573458865.0,"I sincerely hope you feel better. I understand how you feel, in truth I had something similar happen yesterday night, as I woke up sweating and with a sharp pain in my stomach. I know the pain was probably due to the dinner that I ate, however I didn't know that the heat is an ibs ""thing""... that's interesting."
ibs,f77ijtm,t3_dugycu,1573458398.0,"I hope you feel better and have a lovely bath. I understand your frustration, my stomach tends to inflict nightly pains, so I've made it a habit to get everything I need to get done before eating dinner, including a bath/ shower. Doing so has been immensely beneficial for me personally."

introvert,f76zoz1,t3_du9qod,1573440014.0,"Yep yep yep. I always do this, and then I recieve joking text messages asking if I died, and sometimes non-joking ones expressing genuine concern, in which case I feel rather guilty. It also gets stressful after a while, as I slowly see these emails and texts building up and then it hits me that I will have to undergo the exhaustion of reading them all...."
books,f72cfws,t1_f71z8cb,1573358549.0,"I love the smell of physical books, older ones in particular (although the dust makes me sneeze and itch). However, I find that sometimes the text is so small, particularly on older books, or the book is so big and heavy (cough Stephen King) that I struggle to read it anywhere but at home. So I read on a kobo a lot! Mine is waterproof too, so I can even take it to the bath with me :)

I'm currently reading Killing Commendatore by Haruki Murakami on my kobo. If I were to be reading off of the physical copy, it would be a much less portable and convenient read. The cool thing with a kobo is that you can read at night without the blue light negatively impacting your sleep, or something like that. You can even download library books, which will dissapear from your kobo collection after a certain amount of time. I would highly reccomend a kobo to anyone who is a bookworm like me. Although if you like reading books involving photos/ illustrations, I will say that they do not render very nicely on ebook, or at least the version that I use. 

Also speaking of Stephen King, how do you like the Dark Tower series? Is it worth the time and investment? Also my apologies for the extremely long comment, it's something that I unintentionally do."
books,f70soqf,t3_dtsttm,1573332127.0,This is so cool! Almost makes me regret reading a lot of ebooks/ library books because gathering a massive pile seems super satisfying. Keep on reading :)

books,f6ylc9b,t1_f6ygvwk,1573285804.0,"I find it's also easy for me to get back into the book (provided that I have the time). I guess similarly to people who watch shows and prefer to indulge in multiple at once. In truth, when I try to restrict my reading it sort of makes it less enjoyable. Maybe it's because we live in a ""distracted age"".... In which case, I suppose I'll be distracted and happy!"
books,f6ykxjy,t1_f6ygw8n,1573285172.0,"I used to do this for school, I had my designated school reading book and then my at-home book that was usually thicker and more difficult to carry about."

books,f6ygogb,t3_dtfm9w,1573279274.0,"I don't remember the details of this book, as I read it quite a while back, however I remember loving it to death. I literally devoured this book, I could not put it down. This is noteworthy, as I read it during a time period of a few years when I rarely read, and used my phone way too much instead. I would reccomend it to literally anyone who is trying to get back into reading. It is not overly complicated or difficult to get into, it sort of launches you straight into the magic of a page-turning read, and it does so without an overload of action or stimulation. Also, I'm pretty sure the reason that I picked it up (or rather downloaded it for my kobo) was due to reading a recommendation/review for it on this subreddit. So thank you to this subreddit for existing. Anyway, not entirely sure why I wrote this comment... but yes yes amazing book please read it"

I once took a friend there, she brought her ukulele (they've become so popular recently!).

If you are looking for a more self-help type style, the book: Notes on a Nervous Planet- Haig
It is the first book of this style that I have ever read, so I was skeptical at first but in the end found it absolutely lovely. I felt so content with my life and calm after reading it.

Poetry is also nice. I like William Blake and Robert Frost. It can be a good source of inspiration too, and fuel for your imagination. I like to go through  my William Blake book and paste sticky notes on my favourite poems. 

I have been feeling the same way recently too, I hope that getting lost in the beautiful world of books will provide you with some relief. Have a good day/night."
