In reality, you have lost something. You‚Äôve lost the ability to sell.

It‚Äôs an opportunity cost of sorts.

You no longer have mobility.

You are carrying a debt on an asset worth less than the debt. Like a car loan but much worse.

That inability to sell and dissolve the mortgage is terrifying and socially crippling to people.

Especially when we have wage stagnation and no savings. You can‚Äôt even diversify and earn your way out of it.
