mentalhealth,fksypk4,t3_fkh8py,1584501601.0,"I can definitely identify with what you said. I think that part of it is recognizing that something is ""wrong"" and wanting to figure out what that is and why it's a part of you, which is normal. I will say though that this doesn't mean that you're ""broken""; it simply means that there are things that you would like to improve about yourself. After doing a research frenzy about myself though, I realized that ironically, I wasn't finding anything about myself through that process. I was actually using that as a way to distract myself from what was actually going on within me. I'm not sure if that's what's going on with you, but for me, it was helpful to just dial that down. I started spending time with myself and tried to do ""soul-searching"". I meditated, exercised, spent time with family and friends, and focused on what I liked to do. Through that, it benefitted me in 2 ways. First of all, I was relaxed and yes, I still overthought a lot of things, but I generally felt like most stuff was under control and also, I got to build myself. In doing what I was passionate about and devoting time to self-care, I felt more content. I stopped obsessing about what was ""wrong"" with me and diverted that attention to the things that I really care about. The other part that I understand is this feeling of ""guilt"". For the longest time, I didn't want to burden anyone with my issues; they felt insignificant in comparison to theirs. Over time though, I realized that being open doesn't make me toxic or selfish. Any relationship is a 2-way-street; it's not wrong for me to share what's bothering me too instead of having it all be about them. This has made me stronger and I'm slowly learning to get out of that mentality that made me believe for so long that I didn't matter."

A lot of people have let me down, but it sounds like you may have some really genuine friends who care about you. Everyone is different. It's hard not to assume that people won't ""see"" you because of the constant disappointment faced by opening up before, but this is a unique set of circumstances. I noticed that I have presumptions and close myself up right away because I'm scared to be vulnerable, especially with someone who might just take it nonchalantly or judge me, but since then, I realized that it's worth the risk. I realized that certain friends and family do actually care and being open with them, not only made the relationships stronger but has also made me better. I feel freer now. Instead of bottling up everything and only allowing others to come to me, I share what I've endured and what I'm feeling. It won't be easy, but it's definitely worth it."

I don't know if there is anything wrong with you, but it seems to me like your mentality about this is that you are sure that something is wrong. You can't just snap out of that though; it will take a lot of time. However, I suggest doing inward reflections/introspection instead of relying on external research. Maybe you are going through all of this in an effort to avoid something that you don't want to face. I would explore that. Not to sound too cliche, but I think that the answer lies within you. Try sitting with yourself for a moment each day. I recommend meditation. Just close your eyes for 15 minutes and focus on breathing. It has definitely helped me reorient myself."

After he left me, I felt like I was completely worthless; like there was something wrong with me. All I can say is that it will take time to heal. It was really hard for me to love someone and not have that reciprocated, but over time, I realized that I was spending all of my energy on that. I pulled myself up mentally and started to focus on me. 

At first, it was helpful to distract myself. I focused on what I liked to do and started exercising. I also spoke to my friends about it, which felt like a huge relief. I recommend doing the same when you are able to, even if you can't put everything that you are feeling into words. Try to find someone that you trust. 

Also, try to shift your focus on you. I know that it's easy to say, but you can implement self-care in small ways. Even just breathing or meditating might help, especially when you are overwhelmed. I close my eyes for 15 minutes and focus on my breathing. It calms me down. 

You are definitely not worthless! Please don't hurt yourself. You are valuable and your worth isn't determined by her. She just doesn't appreciate you, and you don't need someone like that in your life. It's not easy to see that now, but you are better off without her just like I'm better off without my ex.

Empaths,fks2b2b,t3_fk5pti,1584480809.0,"Yes! I can relate to this. I stopped my parents from divorcing when I was younger and I feel like people always come to me for help. I love doing it, truly, but sometimes, it can get overwhelming. I'm also a HSP so I kind of absorb people's feelings, which if negative, can weigh me down. What has helped me the most is learning how to focus on myself and telling myself that when I do that, it is not selfish. I am also a person that needs to be taken care of. I'll do this in practical ways. 

For example, when I can't meet up with someone, I tell them that they can call me instead or when I feel overwhelmed, I am honest with that and ensure that I am always there for them, but I just need some rest.

 I think that too often as empaths, we forget ourselves in the midst of the chaos, which makes sense because we put people first and value them deeply, but it's time to value YOU. Setting boundaries is important.

Meditation has also helped me. Every morning, I meditate for 15 minutes before starting my day. I just close my eyes and focus on my breathing. It sets up a relaxing mood for the entire day.

suggestmeabook,fks0vd4,t3_fk9azj,1584479955.0,"One of my favorite self-help books is ""Make Your Bed"". 

Here's the description:

**Based on a Navy SEAL's inspiring graduation speech, this #1** ***New York Times*** **bestseller of powerful life lessons ""should be read by every leader in America"" (*****Wall Street Journal*****).**

*If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.*  


On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven addressed the graduating class of the University of Texas at Austin on their Commencement day. Taking inspiration from the university's slogan, ""What starts here changes the world,"" he shared the ten principles he learned during Navy Seal training that helped him overcome challenges not only in his training and long Naval career, but also throughout his life; and he explained how anyone can use these basic lessons to change themselves-and the world-for the better.  


Admiral McRaven's original speech went viral with over 10 million views. Building on the core tenets laid out in his speech, McRaven now recounts tales from his own life and from those of people he encountered during his military service who dealt with hardship and made tough decisions with determination, compassion, honor, and courage. Told with great humility and optimism, this timeless book provides simple wisdom, practical advice, and words of encouragement that will inspire readers to achieve *more*, even in life's darkest moments.

infj,fkrfznz,t3_fk2zej,1584468121.0,"When Frank James said, ""You cut yourself off from half of reality"" that hit me. I feel like I neglect the seemingly-unimportant stuff that I have to do non-intentionally over and over again. If I have to do something like make a phone-call, subconsciously, it will be there, but I keep burying over and over again until one day, I notice that I have a huge pile of stuff that needs to be done NOW. It's hard because I don't live in the here-and-now; I very much create my own reality and live in my head, but I don't know how to get myself out of that. Sometimes, I force myself to do things, but that doesn't grant me fulfillment. I have tried meditation though, which has calmed me down a bit, but the ""unknown"" is still a problem. I hate it when something arises that I didn't account for and I blame myself for not seeing it in the first place. Here's one of Frank James' older videos about inferior extraverted sensing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p\_f6gf0a0i4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_f6gf0a0i4)"

That's some pretty confusing adult stuff. So, uhh, I thought I'd come up here, show you my painting, tell you what I think my play's about because I was thinking that it might make us all feel a little bit better. But you've gotta promise not to make fun of me, OK? So, uhm... yeah, I painted this because I felt like the play was about life, you know, and life is full of color and we each get to come along and we add our own color to the painting, you know? And even though it's not very big - - the painting - - you sort of have to figure that it goes on forever, you know, in each direction? So, like, to infinity, you know. 'Cause that's kinda like life. It's really crazy, if you think about it, that a hundred years ago some guy that I never met came to this country with a suitcase. He has a son, who has a son, who has me. So at first when I was painting I was thinking, you know, maybe that was that guy's part of the painting and then down here that's my part of the painting. And then I started to think... well... what if we're all in the painting... everywhere? And what if we're in the painting before we're born? What if we're in it after we die? And these colors that we keep adding, they just keep getting added on top of one another, 'til eventually we're not even different colors anymore. We're just... one thing. One painting. My dad, he's not with us anymore. He's not alive... but he's with us. He's with me every day. It all just sort of fits somehow, even if you don't understand how yet. People will die in our lives - - people that we love. In the future. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe years from now. I mean, it's kind of beautiful, right, if you think about it, the fact that just because someone dies, just because you can't see them or talk to them anymore, it doesn't mean they're not still in the painting. I think maybe that's the point of the whole thing. There's no dying. There's no 'You' or 'Me' or 'Them.' It's just 'Us.' And this sloppy, wild, colorful, magical thing that has no beginning, has no end, it's right here. I think it's us."" BEAUTIFUL!!!"
