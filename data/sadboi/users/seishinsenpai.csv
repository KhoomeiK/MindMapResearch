The whole “but I gave you birth so I get to treat you as I choose and you have to worship me and praise me for abusing you, and you ruined my life because I decided to have kids “ bullshit arguement is TRASH. I’m so tired of hearing these narcissistic parents use it. That is so beyond abusive, this entire situation. I’m stunned that your siblings are also opting you in to be that person. This is your moms fault that she drunk her liver to hell. And that doctor suggesting even though there is a legit death chance? Bs as well. Just because you don’t have children on this earth doesn’t mean your life doesn’t mean anything. Like you said, you have pets. I’m sure you have friends that you mean a lot to. Anyone. Your life is so important, so important that it isn’t worth donating your liver to your abusive mom that made her own garbage choices to ruin her own; and then expect you to risk your life like that so she can continue to drink. The fact that she as a mother, would put that pressure on her own kid blows my mind. I’m a mother of a son, and even if my son WAS a match I would tell him no. My sons life is far more important than mine, and I’d rather die then see his life get taken, especially by choice. 

I’m so sorry op. Thank you for making the best decision for yourself, you’ve made a beautiful life. Take care of yourself."

But when it’s a whole ass childhood+ counting of trauma, your brain develops a learned behavior of the disassociation, not just in the moment of trauma.

CPTSD,eyv6nc0,t1_eyv5za8,1567482317.0,"The “thing” is just your true self, the untethered part of your soul that no one can break, still here and trying to reach you . I understand the being repulsed by the self love, dude I went through my entire life until maybe 2 years ago (I’m 22) being repulsed by people who love them selves and them accepting themselves. It comes from parents who like you said, literally cannot and never did accept you; and my ndad constantly belittled people who are authentic and are happy with themselves. God, he literally LOATHED them. Treated them like they were mentally ill. Now that I realize what it feels like to have self love, it’s him who’s mentally ill. Self love is the friend, parent; significant other, any person who could have loved you, that is yourself. You don’t need a girlfriend boyfriend or significant other to feel love. It all starts inside , and I’ve only just now started to learn the importance of that. Neglected people as children develop very codependent relationships on every person who shows any sort of love towards them. I literally would cry if a person who was accepting towards me , a stranger in public, would end the convo and go about their ways. It’s immediate attachment, because we were starved of it growing up. Once you got the concept of self love down, dude you are an unstoppable person. Much love to you ♥️ take it day by day:)"
CPTSD,eyv38ja,t1_eyuonbz,1567479348.0,"I used to be very cold to myself before I learned the importance of self love. The thing is, when we are cold to ourselves, it’s a learned behavior from our abusers. How they belittled us, made us feel unimportant, neglected our feelings and emotional health , we in turn do this to ourselves because we learned that we aren’t worthy of love and care towards ourselves . It’s a fucked up cycle. 

In these moments that I comfort myself, I pretend that my voice and comforting thoughts are a seperate person ; I act like the parent I never had . Calming, gentle, unconditionally loving, non judging, accepting, and no matter what the problem is I am here to solve it and take care of you, you’re safe with me and I won’t let you down. Then I seperate that voice and thoughts from my physical body, and treat my body as the child me that’s in pain, because truly we still are just kids that are grown, but our state of mind is still stuck in the abuse of when we were say, 3. 

In these moments I first step back, recognize the memory or situation I’m reacting to. Say it was your parents beating you. All of the feelings and pain are running through my mind at the speed of light and I’m feeling the belt hitting me, the sheer terror and every feeling that went through it. I switch my thoughts and feelings into parent mode, and I’ll even hug myself or just go sit somewhere quiet where no one is, or I’ll look in the mirror and just reassure myself that I’m here , and that abuser is no longer hurting me. That I am safe, and it is okay to feel this pain I’m feeling because that memory was not okay in any way shape or form. I then tell myself that we no longer have to live in these traumas because they will no longer happen, and I’m going to take care of myself and give the love I needed in that traumatic memory that I didn’t get . 

Sometimes I’ll be like let’s go shopping. Let’s go on a walk in my favorite place. Play video games. Watch a movie. It starts off as pretending but literally is a reality , being the parent to the inner child that’s still stuck in a state of trauma that never grew up from. 

Self love is extremely important . More than I can explain. Next time you have a thought towards yourself that is mean, unaccepting, degrading, anything but the utmost love and acceptance towards yourself, ditch it. Remind yourself that this is your abusers voice , and it is not YOU. You are a person beyond worthy of love . The people who abused you didn’t realize how important you were and that is their fault, not yours . 

I hope this helps."

I’m proud of you too for powering through it the best you can. Always remind and be there for yourself, and reassure that it’s okay to feel these emotions. It’s OKAY to get angry , upset and release the anger in a healthy way like you did. It’s okay to feel like a mess. You’ve been through hell and back. I wish I had advice on trying to make it through everyday without having these triggers, I’m in the same boat as you right now trying to just make it through two hours without breaking down over something that would seem small to someone else but truly to us it’s painful as fuck. 

Everyday will get easier , try some inner child work and be your own parent . Constantly talk to yourself and comfort yourself , so far it has helped me through the bouts of rage , crying and disassociating. Tell yourself constantly that you’re proud of yourself and you’re trying your best .
