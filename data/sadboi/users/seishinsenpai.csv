CPTSD,eyv6nc0,t1_eyv5za8,1567482317.0,"The ‚Äúthing‚Äù is just your true self, the untethered part of your soul that no one can break, still here and trying to reach you . I understand the being repulsed by the self love, dude I went through my entire life until maybe 2 years ago (I‚Äôm 22) being repulsed by people who love them selves and them accepting themselves. It comes from parents who like you said, literally cannot and never did accept you; and my ndad constantly belittled people who are authentic and are happy with themselves. God, he literally LOATHED them. Treated them like they were mentally ill. Now that I realize what it feels like to have self love, it‚Äôs him who‚Äôs mentally ill. Self love is the friend, parent; significant other, any person who could have loved you, that is yourself. You don‚Äôt need a girlfriend boyfriend or significant other to feel love. It all starts inside , and I‚Äôve only just now started to learn the importance of that. Neglected people as children develop very codependent relationships on every person who shows any sort of love towards them. I literally would cry if a person who was accepting towards me , a stranger in public, would end the convo and go about their ways. It‚Äôs immediate attachment, because we were starved of it growing up. Once you got the concept of self love down, dude you are an unstoppable person. Much love to you ‚ô•Ô∏è take it day by day:)"
CPTSD,eyv38ja,t1_eyuonbz,1567479348.0,"I used to be very cold to myself before I learned the importance of self love. The thing is, when we are cold to ourselves, it‚Äôs a learned behavior from our abusers. How they belittled us, made us feel unimportant, neglected our feelings and emotional health , we in turn do this to ourselves because we learned that we aren‚Äôt worthy of love and care towards ourselves . It‚Äôs a fucked up cycle. 

In these moments that I comfort myself, I pretend that my voice and comforting thoughts are a seperate person ; I act like the parent I never had . Calming, gentle, unconditionally loving, non judging, accepting, and no matter what the problem is I am here to solve it and take care of you, you‚Äôre safe with me and I won‚Äôt let you down. Then I seperate that voice and thoughts from my physical body, and treat my body as the child me that‚Äôs in pain, because truly we still are just kids that are grown, but our state of mind is still stuck in the abuse of when we were say, 3. 

In these moments I first step back, recognize the memory or situation I‚Äôm reacting to. Say it was your parents beating you. All of the feelings and pain are running through my mind at the speed of light and I‚Äôm feeling the belt hitting me, the sheer terror and every feeling that went through it. I switch my thoughts and feelings into parent mode, and I‚Äôll even hug myself or just go sit somewhere quiet where no one is, or I‚Äôll look in the mirror and just reassure myself that I‚Äôm here , and that abuser is no longer hurting me. That I am safe, and it is okay to feel this pain I‚Äôm feeling because that memory was not okay in any way shape or form. I then tell myself that we no longer have to live in these traumas because they will no longer happen, and I‚Äôm going to take care of myself and give the love I needed in that traumatic memory that I didn‚Äôt get . 

Sometimes I‚Äôll be like let‚Äôs go shopping. Let‚Äôs go on a walk in my favorite place. Play video games. Watch a movie. It starts off as pretending but literally is a reality , being the parent to the inner child that‚Äôs still stuck in a state of trauma that never grew up from. 

Self love is extremely important . More than I can explain. Next time you have a thought towards yourself that is mean, unaccepting, degrading, anything but the utmost love and acceptance towards yourself, ditch it. Remind yourself that this is your abusers voice , and it is not YOU. You are a person beyond worthy of love . The people who abused you didn‚Äôt realize how important you were and that is their fault, not yours . 

I hope this helps."

Everyday will get easier , try some inner child work and be your own parent . Constantly talk to yourself and comfort yourself , so far it has helped me through the bouts of rage , crying and disassociating. Tell yourself constantly that you‚Äôre proud of yourself and you‚Äôre trying your best .
