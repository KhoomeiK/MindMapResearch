depression,fpftzhv,t3_g9ndgw,1588583426.0,"I feel you here. I died at 14 but put a mask on so people don't notice. I don't feel the same as I was before, my body is tired I want to die but I am not suicidal If I got into a car accident or illness I would accept it and leave this world with no regrets. I started to be distant to my friends and family/ on top of that there is the pressure of being perfect/ looking after family members etc. I am just done with every thing."
