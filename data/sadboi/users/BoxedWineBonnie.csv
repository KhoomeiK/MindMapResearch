On the other (anxious, angry) hand, I worry about the precarity of my job and ability to pay rent if this goes on much longer.

Cooking,fmw1ovo,t3_fxkk91,1586437431.0,"Do you know anyone who hunts? Growing up, we didn't have a super regular meat budget but we shared game with our friends and family so there was usually a bunny or some venison sausage knocking around the freezer.

Also, don't be afraid to cook with small amounts of meat, or weird cuts! You can get some quality bones from a fancy butcher that make a meaty stock even without a lot of actual meat on them."
Cooking,fmw0kj6,t3_fxrpg1,1586436616.0,"I always thought Indian food seemed really time-consuming, but then I watched an Indian friend of mine prepare a meal and noticed that he used a pressure cooker and some pre-made spice mixes and pickles that seemed to aid the process.

This was a man who once set his toaster on fire by sticking a pizza slice in sideways. So I think it can be done."
Breadit,fmvz14i,t3_fxrjws,1586435449.0,"All the cool kids were making sourdough during the Time of the Coronavirus, and because I am a yuppie tool, I decided to jump on the bandwagon and grow my own starter from wild yeasts. This despite being an execrable baker even without getting yeast involved.


Turns out, I HATED it. Feeding and monitoring this dumb starter every day reminded me of why I kill all my plants, and why I don't have dogs, cats, or children (despite liking them). I waited impatiently for the starter to mature enough to use, so I could deploy it all at once and cleanse the jar from whence it came forever.


That day has come. I made English muffins. Were they delicious? Yes. Will I ever make sourdough anything ever again? NO. Props to all you true bakers who have the skill and patience to make these things. I salute you and will forever patronize your bakeries with a newfound appreciation for what a pain in the butt your wares are.

I'm in NYC, and so many of my friends, classmates, and co-workers have ""fled"" the city for second homes, or gone to family in other states. Even though I couldn't even have been ""with"" them if they had stayed, I feel abandoned.  
I hate seeing people on social media posting from their suburban home in like, Kansas that make self-isolation look like a cat-cuddling, gourmet-meal-cooking staycation when I can't even find flour in the grocery store.   
I hate seeing advertisements for products or services with a coronavirus ""spin"" on them (""you can use this THING now that you have so much downtime!"") when my friends have lost their jobs because of this and are in no position to go shopping.  
I don't even feel better watching Cuomo's shtick every day because it seems like we are always begging for the same number of ventilators. It feels like no help is coming.

So many people are blowing up my phone because the media makes it sound like it's an absolute hellscape out here with bodies in the street, and now NYC is the bogeyman city no one wants to be. (""It could get as bad as NEW YORK if we don't quarantine now!"")

I was doing okay until I got an email from my school telling me I had been in sustained contact with a person who later tested positive. Now it's stressful because when I tell people I'm self-isolating for this, they act like it's a death sentence. One friend even asked if I had written a will!

My advice is: listen to Cuomo, follow the CDC guidelines, and look at the reality on the ground around you instead of the media."
Anxiety,fln7ys5,t3_fnz5n3,1585311957.0,"Just a note about some of the alarming numbers coming out of New York City right now:

Because of the limited numbers of tests, the [New York City Dept of Health is asking that doctors not test anyone who does not require hospitalization](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2020/covid-19-03202020.pdf). As a result, the NYC numbers seem like the rate of hospitalization among those diagnosed is extremely high. 

However, what this really means is that *there are a ton of people with mild cases here* who aren't getting brought into the statistics because they aren't getting tested. I myself am currently on ""post-exposure watch"" until April 3 due to close contact with a classmate who was diagnosed. I asked my doctor what to do if I feel sick, and she said, ""fluids and rest.""

Am I occasionally freaked out? Of course. But just remember the context that the numbers occur in."
