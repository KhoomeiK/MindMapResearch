depression,fkvzr8i,t3_fkv9mm,1584580234.0,"You will get through this! It can be really hard to lose routine and be at home all day when you suffer from mental illness and anxiety sometimes but there is light at the end of the tunnel. Hang in there! I would recommend distracting yourself with other things like cleaning your room a little,enjoy some music. Drawing can be really relaxing even if you suck at it. I find it really distracting! Good news is! It will pass. A lot of the evidence suggest that this is a bell shaped curve meaning it will get a little rough for a bit then easier and eventually it will hopefully be gone and we can all go back to normal. Until then make sure you aren’t always on social media because rn that is a bit debilitating! Take care my friend"

depression,fbieceg,t1_fbi9o1q,1576898565.0,"I sometimes feel the same way. But mainly because I have made so many mistakes and hurt so many people. The guilt of that is with me everyday I couldn’t sleep for years thinking about how awful I am and how much I would’ve been different and successful if I hadn’t been like that. I wanted so bad to go back and fix all the mistakes and maybe have a better childhood. However, after a lot of time. I came to the realization that is somewhat cliche but the past truly doesn’t define who you are but plays a big part of what you want to become. You can pick and choose what you really liked about yourself back then and work on achieving that but also leaving what you didn’t like. It is a great gift to be able to self reflect and improve yourself. While the past has passed. The present is yours to do with whatever you want. Seek help. Find love. Work hard. It’s all still possible as long as you’re still breathing. Humans are more resilient than they like to think. I hope you are able to find a life more fulfilling than anything you’ve had before"
