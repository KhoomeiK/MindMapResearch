progresspics,fpng59i,t1_fpidu6g,1588761741.0,"From 120 downward is VERY VERY freaking hard. It took me longer than the 20 pounds before lol but if you persevere you’ll get there!! remember to drink water, i know it’s boring, but trust me.. never felt so clean😂👌🏻 let me know how it goes 💪🏻"
progresspics,fpng0nr,t1_fphgbaf,1588761613.0,"wow you’re doing great!! i’m sure you’ll get there in no time, and thanks so much, i’m glad i can help somehow!! let me know how it goes, if you want 👌🏻"

progresspics,fphecnl,t1_fpfq1zt,1588619780.0,"they’re a pain!! I know i may sound cliché.. but drink green tea, i drink lots of it and it helps me debloat, even during that time of the month where you gain weight 😭😭"
progresspics,fphe6xd,t1_fpfk3ft,1588619696.0,"You can do it!! 
I’m still very far from my goal (i should exercise more, and tone my body but eh.. i’m a potato ahha) 
ok the first pounds were quick, like maybe a month or so, but damn like from 125 to 110 it was a bit longer. Wanted to give up and as I said during quarantine i did some slip ups.. but overall i’d say, 4-5 months 
you can do better i’m sure lol"
progresspics,fphdwd9,t1_fpfjt99,1588619544.0,"Thank you!! I basically did Intermittent fasting and CICO, cut on carbs (mainly ate them for lunch and that’s it) and of course avoided all junk food :) good luck!!"
progresspics,fphdksg,t1_fpeiqov,1588619378.0,"Sorry for the late reply! 
I cut on carbs, (still ate them but mainly whole grains and during lunch time, no for dinner) the Intermittent Fasting 16:8, some days 18:6, i try to drink 1,5 to 2 lt of water a day but it’s a struggle lol. I (used to) work as a barista so the first punds went down quickly, struggled a bit more when the place closed down for covid-19, literally been a couch potato 😂 but yeah that’s about it :) i don’t exercise much.. but i should start. sorry for my bad english, i’m italian!"
FemaleHairLoss,fnopcpl,t1_fno607a,1587130848.0,"Thanks so much for replying!! (and sorry for my english lol i’m italian)

yeah I want to use Minoxidil soooo bad, but i’m terrified it might kill her or something so yeah 🙈"
FemaleHairLoss,fno0ip6,t3_g2nojm,1587107696.0,"wow thanks so much for the info!! I recently just bought my dermaroll, but it’s the 0,5 mm.. cos I read that it was better, but now i regret it .. i’ll use it anyway and hopefully something will happen.

FemaleHairLoss,f4uc8sq,t1_f4ubzwm,1571805299.0,"It was back in 2015. Together with I had an eating disorder so probably it contributed, but out of all the years that I had it my hair never fell. So yeah, i am now 4 months off of it (stupid me I tried it again ahah but the pill this time) and again I noticed some shedding so I stopped once more and now my hair are kinda ok. By the way it’s normal if now you’re losing quite much cos it’s autumn.. but again, maybe get checked so you’ll be fine and relaxed about it! Sorry for my broken english, I’m Italian🙈 let me know if you get any better 👍🏻"
FemaleHairLoss,f4u972q,t3_dlnajk,1571802574.0,"yes. I lost most of my hair when started the contraceptive patch, and especially when I stopped it. It never grew back, and I have a small bald spot on my front part.. but if you catch it quickly you might be able to do something about it. I was too late 😢"
