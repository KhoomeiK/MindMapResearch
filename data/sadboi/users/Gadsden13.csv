BoyScouts,fcaq6qg,t1_fcaescs,1577574391.0,"""Duty to GOD and my country"". Under divinity and under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, refugees fleeing their home country have the right to seek safe asylum and ""security of person"". 

Most of the families fleeing have never had the opportunity to legally apply for refugee status while in their home country. Out of fear many find it impossible to speak out against troubles going on in their home countries. Before the US Immigration Dept. can allow Central Americans to apply for asylum they first must apply to Mexico's Immigration Dept. 

The detainment camps along the border are simply Americans doing their Christian duty of charity. Hopefully Mexico will allow families escaping the tyranny of street gangs further south to reside as refugees in Mexico.

As for organizing Boy Scouts of America activities in Central America, many areas are safe but other areas are similar to various cities in the US if not worse. Why Latin American countries don't do more to stomp out violence and give their people a better life is beyond my Christian understanding. A lot of it is probably politics and who gets votes from which demographic (i.e. gangs with members that vote for and possibly scare away civilians from voter station polls are given the blind eye by the police through indirect orders at the expense of innocent civilians trying to go about an average life).

Also I was partially joking about earning the merit badges I mentioned. A High Adventure Base in Central America would be very nice though and would give many opportunities to young Central American Boys and Girls to live, learn, serve, and have fun. With guidance from the BSA and Mexico's scouting equivalent they could incorporate a High Adventure Camp in a more peaceful country like Belize. Snorkeling, exploring the forests, visiting ancient monuments, and serving the environment. As an adult and former BSA member I'd be waiting line ready to adventure and enjoy a Central America High Adventure Base alongside scouting enthusiasts from all over Central and Latin America.

Constructing and maintaining this camp would also prove valuable to the areas economy and job growth. Youths would be given ample opportunity to be part of scouting and avoid gang activity. Why seek asylum in the USA if children and families have opportunities within their own countries to make a better life for themselves and others through the Boy and Girl Scouts?

Baden Powell thrived to prepare young men for better futures, lets prepare our neighbors to the south for a future where they can choose their destiny. Where they have greater options to attend school. Options to work rewarding careers without threats from gang activity. Options to choose to join the military, civic, or environmental services. Prepare their minds for leadership and teamwork. Prepare their body's physically for healthy living. And prepare them morally with help from church groups or righteous mentors.

In the United States of America, children and families have many opportunities. Whether its opportunities to attend different schools or learn different trades. Opportunities to serve the greater good after grade school with AmeriCorps or opportunities to defend freedom with military service. Opportunities to learn and have fun with the Boy and Girl Scouts, extracurricular programs, and JROTC. Citizens of the USA are blessed.

Many citizens in Latin American countries don't have similar opportunities to live life on a good path. For many giving up everything to live as refugees is thier best hope at a good life. Lets help our neighbors rebuild their neighborhoods with opportunities for many instead of having little to no other options than to wait in bureaucratic nightmare of a line, just to take away from US citizens or be turned around to the nightmare the came from.

It's nonChristian and nonHumanitarian to let people starve and become victims of crime, the elements, and poor health."

With no social support, housing, or job lined up illegal immigrants fall victim to crime and the elements as well as disease that most of us wouldn't think about. Its sad but at least they have a place to stay, food to eat, medicine, and a dream."

When I first read about the Uyghur crisis I thought they were just displaced people, turned out one million people are being held in concentration camps, deprived of human rights, tortured, and denied ability to practice theyre religion. This is a crisis that demands the everyone on Earth to pay attention to and ensure no human rights are threatened.

United Nations Declaration of Human Rights"
Feminism,fbqkwkg,t1_fbq8iql,1577032748.0,"Since China's been modernizing and treating their workers right I have been looking away. But since China has taken rights away from Hong Kong this year and selling resources to north korea the past couple of years even after and during threats and missile tests everyone has no other choice but to pay attention to Human Rights abuses stemming from china.

When I first read about the Uyghur crisis I thought they were just displaced people waiting for a new home. 1 million people being forced into concentration styled camps for years, inhumanely treated, stripped of their liberty, and forced to deny their religion? Wtf?"
geopolitics,fbn2k52,t1_fbn0s8w,1576991885.0,"China could at least have more transparency. At least Russia allows some free press to report on situations in Crimea and Syria.

By the way, do you know if Russia has stopped bombing hospitals in Syria? I saw reports of that on the news it really makes me want to give the russian federation a boot up the butt."

Thankfully I just read the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. I don't have to worry so much about other people so far away knowing that the United Nations and other watch dogs are on it making sure everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of freedom and to live safe lives.

However it is still up to average people to look out for the oppressed, make sure people are healthy and safe, educate others, and hope for better futures full of opportunity for everyone here on Earth."

geopolitics,fbm43nm,t1_fblp1yc,1576977853.0,"This is academic, Uyghur Muslims are ethnically 'Turkic' and are culturally more similar to Turkey and Tajikistan than they are to China. Also 22 nations have condemned China on its abuse of these people and these women are threatened by being forced to sleep with men against their will. All of this goes against United Nations Declaration of Human Rights effecting all of us who share these inalienable rights."
