aww,fo162xl,t1_fo15ep6,1587426497.0,"Aw. I have a brother and sister cat that I adopted together when they were only 7-8 weeks old. They were dying when I first met them at a friend of a friend's. I told his parents that they needed to go to the vet and they said they could not afford it. The house had over 15 other cats. My 2 cats were the only 2 kittens left alive out of 2 litters they had in the house. I told them that I would get a vet appointment and that I would be keeping them. 



At first they refused. They said they wanted to keep them because they would just sit and sleep in your lap. I had to point out that that was because they were dying of malnutrition and the fleas were making them anemic. I had to sit there and tell them that that was why all the other kittens died. They could either give them to me or cause 2 more deaths from negligence. So they finally relented. 



I got them fixed once they were old enough. They are now 2.5 years old. I send pictures to the family that originally had them once and a while so that they know I take good care of them and that they made the right choice. Both my cats love eachother so much. They are bestfriends. It's so cute."
