COLORS!  closing my eyes was so much more vivid and all of a sudden I felt this desire to lay down and my body moved to this cushion I had layed down next to me.  It felt like what it looks like when peoplefilm themselves doing things backwards and then play it forwards so it is that jerky uncanny valley look to it.  Like Cold Plays the Scientist video.  IT didn't feel like me moving me.  I close my eyes again and I just felt like I was in this 3d kaleidoscope of tentacles and colors and insane shapes, and the feeling of a female presence and then I sort of started coming out of it.  I heard my voice asking ""what is going on? what is happening?  and then it started to fade and I opened my eyes.  I laid there watching the room swirling like LSD visuals and wondered....

Oh I can get really attached to someone really fast and then all of a sudden really dislike them.  It's a pattern of idealization then devaluation...probably at any hint they might be rejecting me or just to beat them to it because no relationships last forever, certainly not any of mine.  being bipolar makes it harder and they intersect a lot but borderline mostly centers around interpersonal connectivity and abandonment"

BPD,ezdhg0c,t3_cz4zs8,1567850057.0,DAE not feel like they can't plan anything even a few hours away hardly because they don't know who they will be or what mood they will be in then.  Let alone planning something days away?  The depression is a black hole that feels like it is slowly turning me into a ghost...like I am dying in super slow motion and slowly fading away a tiny bit each day. sometimes I talk to myself because I just need to hear a human voice near me.  I'm terrified of physical touch sometimes for no reason I just have an irrational fear it will hurt.  I talk all the time about myself the way you probe a sore in your mouth with your tongue.  I'm not self-absorbed I have something wrong in there and I'm trying to figure out what it is all the time and who I am at as well......take a  deep breath

If I have to wait a couple weeks for something like a tolerance reset it sounds like so far away I want to cry.  Waiting in line at the grocery store I have exploded and yelled and made nasty comments only to later realize only 20 seconds had elapsed and nothing was wrong I just can't handle the time.  However, meditation and maybe some cannabis has helped me be a lot more patient and I now sometimes get complemented on how patient I am.  They told me it was a gift.  Hahaaha nope I am totally not gifted with patience.  Sometimes I'm queued for a video game and I'm like wtf is this queue it is taking so long and I look and its been like 45 seconds lol"

If we are spirits connected to these bodies then he isn't really being violent if he kills us because it is his Tech and he can easily place us in another body or let us live as a spiritual being like we are meant to be...in fact anyone who wants to can ascend.

  However, not everyone wants to and I think that is fine.  Perhaps these bodies are like a puzzle our spirit babies are tossed into to figure out that we aren't these bodies at all but spirits who shouldn't care about things affected by gravity and time...Figure that out and you can then spend your time enjoying the beauty of this world and helping show other people the way."
