EatingDisorders,fqtcdvn,t3_gksno8,1589635974.0,"I absolutely empathize with your feelings of shame, but we must try to remind ourselves that that is the illness, wanting secrecy and control and to remind you of anything negative about yourself.

These times are trying and hard; it‚Äôs more important at this time than others to prioritize self compassion. Nothing is regular, nothing is the same, it feels like we‚Äôve all woken up in an alternate universe ! This is a perfect time for your ED to come swooping back in to your life and fuel itself off of isolation and uncertainty. But that is not you, you have gotten to a place in your recovery before that you can and will get to again, just like before! You should really really try to reach out to someone in your life, whether it be your therapist or boyfriend, and tell them what‚Äôs up. They are there to support you and understand your journey, i know shame can keep us from doing a lot of things, but please try to reach out to someone, even just telling someone will lift a weight off your shoulders you might not know you‚Äôre feeling. I am wishing you kindness, health, and support in the coming times. I would say try not to be too hard on yourself but i know eating disorders pretty much define being hard on oneself and it‚Äôs not that easy.

And always remember, relapse is a PART of recovery, not the end of it. You will learn and grow from this, I believe in you <3"
EatingDisorders,fp419wi,t3_gb2e1a,1588289717.0,"Coming from someone who recently divulged my bulimia to my parents, yes, please yes a million times yes, tell someone you trust that is willing to support you. My parents have suspected it for years but until I opened up to them I never got any better. I promise, just even the act of opening up and not bottling it in on your own anymore is SO freeing from that moment on. Please find support and I hope you find it in your parents. Im here for you (always if you wanna reach out to me too) and wish you the best of luck & love!!!"

EDAnonymous,fo52u2c,t3_g5nz4p,1587516304.0,"I had this happen to me a few years ago. I didnt really eat the day before, woke up the next morning to go to school but didnt even make it to the kitchen before throwing up on the living room floor. I'm not sure exactly why it happens but to me it seems like a ""normal"" response, considering the very little amount of food in the stomach over a long period of time, plus going from sleeping to waking which is a whole other thing, I think it probably is something like a protective thing to cope with the acute stress I just put my body through. Stay safe tho! hope this helped"

AskReddit,fhmdjat,t3_f3ricx,1581711442.0,"printers. not talking about 3D ones those are sick af. But also why the fuck are we bothering with printing 3 dimensions when all the 2D ones are still so unreliable and frustrating enough to use that it would drive any person to lose their marbles from just trying to get a few carefully placed ink splotches onto a sheet of paper? Feel like we missed a couple steps there....it‚Äôs like we just gave up on 2D printers and cursed the world with an eternal source of frustration. 
i have strong opinions about this."

I will say my grades weren‚Äôt unusually high, but if you explain your situation and are well rounded in other areas on your AIF, there‚Äôs a good chance you will get in :) 

Wishing you all the best!"
