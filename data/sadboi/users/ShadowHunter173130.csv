Urine is sterile, it can be used so your body can focus on specific areas. Your skin is an organ and absorbs and releases things, such as acne and pimples from environmental factors, nutrition factors, and self care factors. Next time you get a sunburn cut or any minor injury, cup your hand in the shower and apply where needed. Your body is a conveyor belt, you put in nutrients and your body processes it, if a belt gets squeaky or the machine gets dirty or starts moving at a different speed, you change what you do. For example, intolerances, allergic to foods, animals etc. You can also use it sublingual (under your tongue) which goes to your lymphatic system directly, urine is a looking glass into your bodies health, alike to a vaccine that injects a small dose of a virus, if you have the virus present, very small portions alike to a vaccine will show up in urine, you send it right through your lymphatic system which is as big and as important as your circulatory system, that produces your immune response. This system sends resources around the body alongside the bloodstream, when you target locations of your skin with urine, it has trace amounts of the baddies your body flushed out, it detects them again at that location absorbed in the skin and targets them, when you fast and do this, it works even better as you get the benefit of the autophagy process and when you refeed( a 2 to 3 day fast) this will boost strong immune cells, which is why doctors across the country recommend fasting. Urine has been a thing for our whole existence as beings. Alike to your spit and saliva that has a ton of enzymes that break down substances for digestion which is why it‚Äôs the best cleaner out there. Eg glasses mirror and then water wipe down etc, even with alcohol. Anyways who am I. Do your own research or just go to your drug dealing doctor to sell you your own bodies natural processes kek. They have their place for real issues like surgery and broken bones etcetera and medication when you actually need it such as your body denying a new kidney transplant etcetera. Keep popping Tylenol and srris ladsüëç

Research it for yourself before you call me a nut. Also read up on 5gamericas official white papers for the technology and what resonance is. Go down the qanon pizzagate obamagate rabit hole and along with the YouTube series Hidden secrets of money. Whether 5G is sketchy or not take a look at cellphone radiation from university of Melbourne. Compare and contrast and form your own opinion. You owe it to yourself to educate yourself and test theories on yourself and prove yourself right or wrong. I thought urine and fasting was fucking crazy, until I lost over 100lbs and found out how real it all was for body functions. 1. Research both sides of a view, urine is bad, urine is good. Research the science and facts behind it, check multiple sources and third party. Collect the information, if it can be tested, test it and have a hypothesis before you do, form your opinion on whether you want to agree with it or not, do this for anything you read, look into the mockingjay project and other programs still well and alive today. Poor trump and all the actual fake news, alike to Daniel in the bible, they can throw him into flames and a pit of lions but at the end his word will come through as true, and those will be thrown into the pit of lions and feasted on.... pizzagate obamagate now and Jeremiah 30-31 is the storm trump talked about, it‚Äôs all for Israel.

Eat whatever you want between 12pm and 5pm, eat to satiate your body and below or above your needs if you are exercising or not. This does not mean work, this means body weight exercises and lifting weights until you feel a burn and a sweat goes on. If you are not doing this, eat less. But make up a healthy omelette with peppers onions veggies etc  cheese with fruits like bananas oranges apples blueberries strawberries raspberries kiwis.

DecidingToBeBetter,fq6aqe0,t1_fq68j2f,1589127893.0,"It‚Äôs better to get all the nutrients you need in from the food you eat and not supplements. Your body has natural appetite suppression but it takes 1 to 2 days to occur, depending on how fast you go into ketosis. You will not feel hungry at all, your body has two modes, building and repairing. The standard American diet promotes constant building with no time to kill useless cells to be repurposed, such as immune cells... during these times. Scientifically proven that if you fast for 3 days and then refeed on a nutritious real food meal, that comes from the ground, plant, tree, animal. Basically anything at the outside parts of grocery stores, you will strengthen your immune system. Machine learning is based off this concept, the strongest cells get replicated while the weak generations die off. Alike to your immune system, supplements are not always bad, for example a polio vaccine. But alike to right now herd immunity is people taking care of their health and body and letting it fight the virus naturally and create a new generation of antibodies which can be used to fight easier the next time you get it or not even contract it at all. The more you depend on external factors like multiple drugs doing the bodies natural processes, the higher risk these viruses become immune to those medications and even vaccines. Take care of your nutrition and give your body time to heal and only eat what you need to satiate it. Calories are like a bun and they consist of filling proteins fats and carbohydrates, most carb products are empty of nutrients so you are giving your body a nutrient void sandwich each time, it‚Äôs like putting gold fish pasta rice between 2 buns, while if you put veggies meats on your sandwich you will have tons of vitamins and protein that your body needs. If you love food like I do, dive deep into good foods, look at pesto a good garlic onion mushroom butter basted steak with steamed or stir fried veggies. You can make way better foods at home cooking and that will satiate your body, this is the real way to be a foodie instead of munching on a bag of chips or Oreos, even if they are fucking amazing at times. Before fasting, Look into a healthy relationship with food each day and not eat few hours before bed and eat at noon and that will do you wonders. That is what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm from a big guy to beach body apart from a little belly fat. I still love to eat as I did before but it‚Äôs managed better through different mindful choices in the kitchen. You can still eat what you love and make new things and that‚Äôs the most amazing part. Also listen to your body when it tells you something, feel crappy and sluggish and couldn‚Äôt do what you could a few years ago, you can get back your youth and ability if you just listen. Learn what is thirst, because it‚Äôs very similar to hunger and also notice any inflammation or acne or pains. Your body tells you things and gives you cravings and you can find alternatives. It‚Äôs a conveyor belt that goes to a adapting living machine that can improve or start to fail and it will give you error messages and beep codes when it doesn‚Äôt like something on the conveyor belt, you can choose to ignore it or you can try and listen and get that baby purrin like a finely tuned hemi engine. It‚Äôs just small actions, right fuel and engine oil, maintenance and cleaning and you have a beautiful car, if you ignore squeaky breaks, ac belt isn‚Äôt working.

Being strict teaches kids to study and memorize for a test without really learning anything at times, it also lets them know failure is not an option. Which is why you have kids kill themselves after failing sats and other standardized testing around the world because a number defines their future education and career path. Failure is the best thing because you learn from it, there is reward in it because you learn how to approach it differently, whether it‚Äôs playing Mario and hopping over the pipe before the plant comes up, how to defeat a boss or how to outplay someone in lol. Same as learning from wrong answers in math, those who learn from mistakes in math may learn even better than those who got it the first time.

It made me why I should even bother trying if he had it all and it was not enough to stick around for. At that point I had two options, inaction: take my life or action and do something to change. I decided to give myself a year to try fully. To be actionary on parts of my life that lacked action, I learned about myself in meditation, therapy and counceling, now have self acceptance with my past failures and mistakes and confidence with my body image and feeling comfortable in my own skin, along with trust in my ability and has eradicated my anxiety because I am more decisive.

As for religion I found my faith in the past 2 months during this pandemic during reflection, one day I decided to pray and I had my prayers answered, I tried and again it happened. And that was enough for me to confirm my faith in Jesus. I‚Äôm not a religious church going person but frankly after all the pain I went through and others around me faced, it was the only thing that made sense, my uncles death was so I could find perspective to the family that I had around me, when I felt most alone and ready to take my life, at the wake I saw all the people left behind, all the people that cared and loved him, his wife and daughter and our direct family. It was so I wouldn‚Äôt hurt any more of them and be better so they would never have to feel the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. I couldn‚Äôt do that to my father.

SuicideWatch,fpmch1m,t3_ge4tw1,1588730081.0,"I felt the exact same until I learned how money works. Changed my whole perspective on life. There are things you can do to have it work for you so it does not determine whether you eat or have shelter or not. The rule of 72 and compound interest will change your perspective on companies, your personal finance and how the world turns. Money is just a tool, alike to a Swiss Army knife, it can do many things and it can work for you if you use the right attachment, but if you don‚Äôt use it right you can yourself or the thing you are trying to use it on. 

The rule of 72 is the number of years your money will take to double at an interest rate. For example if you had a 10% return which the s&p 500 which is the top 500 companies has historically had a return of ~9.7% over the past couple of decades.
72/10=7.2 years to double your money. So that‚Äôs the concept. Now it‚Äôs also called the bankers rule for a good reason. What they generally do is give you low rate generic savings accounts or gic instead of tax advantaged accounts like tfsa Roth IRA rrsp etc. I know this because they did it to me, tossed a credit card at me and a shitty savings account and that‚Äôs it and it‚Äôs how they make their money.

Now what they do is that money in your savings or checking account, it‚Äôs not sitting there, it‚Äôs not in a desk drawer or under the mattress or in a vault. It‚Äôs being lent out to you or your neighbour at 19-22% interest on a credit card. Let‚Äôs make it 20. Let‚Äôs say you have a savings account with 1000 at 1.5%. That‚Äôs 1015 meanwhile they lend that same 1000 at 20%=1200. Now what they do is pocket the 185. Now if you got 7% which is still fair and good, a conservative long term tax advantaged account you could get for yourself 1070 after 1 year compounded annually. Now you will be reinvesting dividends and continuously reinvesting.

Now you look at this and compare, contrast and extrapolate against the world, inflation is a good thing but when other things such as the housing market get out of balance it can cause issues as it‚Äôs a corresponding floating market based on the dollar which is based around the connection to gold and it‚Äôs value. Now inflation is a double edged sword in society, it keeps everything going forward but it‚Äôs a sword where if you fall below it, you keep getting cut. Inflation has been around 1-3 percent and can vary where you live, consumer price index around 1.4 for my Provence each year in which the price of goods and services will go up. This is why landlords can only raise their rent so much each year. Inflation allows  for competition and scaling of value for a product. Assuming 3% inflation on a 100 dollar bill for numbers sake,97 will be its buying power the following year, that will entice you to sell your product at 103 dollars to make 100 even. And if you believe your product to be valued more, then value it at 110. Now some people tend to fall into the trap of gics and low jnterest savings accounts that are 1.5% where you are litterally losing money each year. These are super safe accounts meant for super large sums of money at low risk, they aren‚Äôt government bonds safe but still. 
Anyways as you know they print money as it‚Äôs a man made concept for trade, it‚Äôs just the fact if one farmer had chickens for eggs and another had chickens and cows, why would farmer 2 buy farmer 1s eggs. He has his own. So he sells at the market to buy milk, local bartering and equivalent exchange has gone away because of money, the one constant between all trades these days. 

But the one thing you have, every day you wake up and there is a check book on your night stand with 1440 dollars and is more valuable than any dollar or material possession and that check book is time. There are 1440 minutes in a day, you cannot trade it or ever get it back. But the amazing thing alike to your money compounding, you can leverage your time to accomplish things. Compound your days efforts to accomplish insane feats, change yourself and your surroundings, make life easier for loved ones. Leave a lasting impression or mark in this world. Do the things you enjoy doing now, don‚Äôt waste your most valuable asset, time, on things you hate doing. Hate that job, find another one. Messy room, do it in quadrants, make your bed and go from your night stand to the closest thing right or left to it and clean it. Make a routine of it. Nutrition diet and exercise to compound efforts on your body to make it feel amazing. Work at things that reward in time like musical hobbies self development, the arts and reading. Physical sports and practice it. Compound your hours. Learn a song each week and soon enough you will be just as good as the greats. Look what the romans and Egyptians and many others did before us. Compounding effort across thousands of man hours to create magnificent feats of humanity. We can land rockets now, we will head to mars and the galaxy potentially in our or our kids lifetimes. Look right now, flattening the curve, a joint effort of mankind that compounds into herd immunity. Imagine what we can do once we get out of our homes and this all passes, new boom, lads getting out building some roads making new homes inventing new tech exploring new planets going into virtual reality. Amazing stuff to come within our lifetime and we are watching history right now. Thanks for reading if you did. Life is a double edge sword, if you get down in the gutters, it keeps hurting you, rise above and your life will compound. Crossing that blade is hard but you have to make the choice and promise to yourself and commit to it. Alike the story of the Good Samaritan, good read, you have to practice to keep crossing the road and do right by your soul telling you to do what you know what is right and those around you. There will be many that won‚Äôt but you have to live your own path, who cares about the grass is greener on the other side, that‚Äôs your neighbours lawn, get some seed and fresh soil and grow your own lawn and take care of it.

It‚Äôs your body telling you to look for those things. Having a guide to better understand it and quench those with a healthy alternative is nice, not to say you cannot have those original food cravings such as pasta or chocolate, but you should not be eating them daily or weekly, I personally believe they are to be treated as treats and rewards for good behaviour. Achieve something good at work, go for a nice Italian dinner or a different meal you like. Birthday is cake. Ice cream could be a treat for family outing during hot sunny day. Pasta as a once or twice a week weekday meal with something else like veggies meats etcetera. Satiate you‚Äôre body as it‚Äôs asking for specific nutrients. Treat it good as it‚Äôs the only one you have.

The lymphatic system does different things:

it acts as a one-way drainage system ‚Äì this means it moves fluid from body tissues into the blood circulation
it contains white blood cells called lymphocytes, which fight infection
it gets rid of any waste that cells make.

Just off of that, you should do your own research and self isolate, look out for bowel issues like diarrhea, a dry cough fever and migraines. 
Keep an eye on your breathing and inform those around you that you may have it. Wash your hands to be sure and have them clean door handles, toilet handles any cross contamination zone. 

Call the hotline and they could diagnose you over the phone, most likely they will ask you to self isolate than to take up hospital room as you are healthier, if your breathing gets any worse you get in there, it is like pneumonia.

depression,flxiw3y,t1_flxgcbe,1585583768.0,"For exercise, you have to start one way. By action, like I mentioned before by automating your body to put your hands on the weights and do it, you can start simple and pass each day adding more. Start with stretches in the morning, then add 5 squats next day add 5 push-up, next day keep adding more and more. Once you realize you can carry that weight with body automation then you can start including your brain into those tasks and start pushing your body. 

The first view is to treat it as a mind to body connection, this is how you grow mental strength with your body. This is mental strength to push your body beyond what it could do last time, some call it a runners high, it is where you do not treat the pain and stimulus from your body as negative, you know how it feels so you can therefore manage it and even drown it out, you know when you get a cut and you focus on the pain and it just isn‚Äôt that bad? You ascend that threshold and know you could deal with a larger pain, it‚Äôs just your body telling your brain that you are hurt, it‚Äôs merely a signal and suggestion, alike to the double yellow line on a road or a red light, there is nothing physically stopping you from crossing those points freely. It becomes a mental barrier, I can‚Äôt go one more mile, that pain burn  input from my legs is telling me I cannot pass that stoplight or cross the yellow line, but I know that burn feeling and it‚Äôs not hurting me, my body is giving me suggestions which my brain will take control and make my body keep going because  my brain knows I can do it. You can start to pass previous bests and start transcending your pain and suffering this way. If you know a paper cut pain and can take it and start to enjoy it, you can start taking on bigger pains scars and hardships in life. This also is a blessing and curse for pleasures, you know masturbation hits a peak for pleasure and you know how it will feel, the peak and then drop after. You have to control the dopamine the brain receives. It‚Äôs like pressing the easy button, that was easy. If you use this tool wrong, you will make these daily tasks and chores seem less worth it as you get no high out of it, you don‚Äôt get a high from doing chores and exercising, you do from dopamine, from eating junk food, smoking weed and drinking alcohol, masturbation, video games and cell phone. You need to use these as medicine, you do not drink a bottle of Buckley‚Äôs do you now? You take a dose. Now what‚Äôs the purpose of a Penis? To reproduce and remove left over nutrients and toxins from your body. It literally is a glass window into your biochemistry biology and is a feedback loop. If you want to masturbate, ask yourself if there is another person in your bed or not. If there isn‚Äôt, you have no biological reason to do it. It‚Äôs just a useless waste of resources, you need to use these tools responsibly, because they are just that. Things used in best practice can skyrocket you into the life you want. The small things you do now add up to your daily, weekly monthly and annual performance and happiness. You use the resources around you as tools. Use proper nutrition to keep your body at peak performance with training, coffee being a stimulant is to only be used when you are alert and focused, it enhances what you have already, if you are tired you are stimulating a tired person, you will crash and burn."
depression,flxc6do,t3_frrmpu,1585579953.0,"This is something I can truly help with because I fought it hard and learned how to beat this resistance. 
This will initially be very hard to do and keep doing but after a week or two it gets better to do these things and then you will be free to see what physical or mental challenges you want to pursue.

You have to treat your brain and body as 2 different parts of you, they are friends but not one person. One is the grand architect, the brain. And one is the sculpture, the body. Right now you face major resistance in doing things you know you should do and can do but you avoid it and the anxiety gets terrible thinking of the mountain you must now climb every day to reach what you want to achieve. 

What depression does is cuts the link between the two, your brain wants to be active but your body doesn‚Äôt, so your brain is in a feedback loop of overthinking and tends to hate on your body for inaction.

Now this is what you do, you have to use your brain to create a bulletproof framework for your body to follow so you can then autopilot those tasks. Action with best practices is that framework.

Your starting framework will be tough but it works to kill that resistance, your brain will suffer during this time but once you do it and keep doing it, your brain will be comfortable with your body doing these things. 

This is how you are going to do it, 
if you see something, you must put your hand on it, if you see laundry that needs to be done, touch the laundry basket and then use your brains framework of best practice to pick up the clothing and do a wash, if your eyes see any garbage or dirty dishes, do not avoid it, your job is to put your hand on it and do what needs to be done. Your brain is using all your energy for the menial things and thought looping, where it cannot focus on the things that matter to you. 

Now once you start you have to keep going and going for the first bit, the best thing to do is to never ever leave a task you can do today for you tomorrow, do not leave garbage or dishes overnight, get dressed after you shower, wear something fresh every day. It becomes automated after practice, you just do it without any second thought or resistance. 


You will start to realize how limited you were before in your thought and potential. What if you could automate and perfect other parts of your life and create a top performer framework and push yourself further and further every day. What if you lived each day with the intention of those efforts compounding over time? What if you just automated your nutrition/fasting and training, you just did it no thought, you would reach statue of David levels real quick. 

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit. ~ Aristotle

At Least I can say I gave it a try, but what I had found is that I still have not even reached my peak performance, I can keep doing bench, learn about my career field further, learn about human problems and a way to solve them, think about the scientific and religious mysteries of this existence. I already know about myself a bit, so this got me thinking and wanting to learn about others, they can give more insight than we can on our own. 

I can see either 2 paths, I live my life with the purpose of trying achieving absolute greatness or I would end my life, I am leaning more towards the first, I want to see if I can actually do it. I don‚Äôt want to die an ordinary man.

PRO TIP: the best framework I have ever found for weight loss is snake diet, if you follow it to the mark and don‚Äôt bullshit you will achieve amazing physical changes and feats, you will be amazed at how amazing and complex our bodies are once you learn more about our bodies functions.

Self love is important, reward yourself when you do good and learn from when you fall short, write down what you feel when you realize you missed a chore or task of fell short to your best practice framework, forgive yourself and get it done the very next day, reward yourself with wants, I‚Äôm getting a new gaming headset and new guitar strings next week because I have been doing good this week."
depression,flx99ml,t3_frrbyr,1585578165.0,"I‚Äôve noticed this too, it‚Äôs societies expectation that men are to be strong and stoic. Clench your teeth to the world and go I‚Äôm a man I can get through the pain and hardships and talking about it means losing that strength of pushing through the pain, to become vulnerable to your thoughts feelings pains and traumas that you have been keeping from everyone is a hard thing no one wants to face and show weakness even more to others you care about or respect their opinion. I have a very close friend I have opened up and vice versa to and it has helped quite a bit because we have dealt with similar hardships and have found ways to grow through those pains. People understand others need time, hell people become zoned into themselves and it‚Äôs true, people stop messaging, socializing etc., but the flip side that made me think differently is that, waiting for a message from someone and didn‚Äôt get one? A friend asked Why didn‚Äôt you just call or message them instead, it‚Äôs a 2 way street, you have the same power as them, so I have been doing that, I have tried to take the role of leader in my house and friend circle, I‚Äôm the one that gets everyone together for an outing, does the planning and logistics. Helps when people need it or whenever I am able to, see dishes that are not yours, do them. See a mess that‚Äôs not yours do it, lead by example and people will respect you more. When you open up, you will be more respected because you are carrying a mental weight while working hard at life, it makes them see that it‚Äôs okay to feel that way and address it when they see a fellow top performer and leader fight through it successfully."
depression,fltv06q,t3_fr565y,1585488054.0,"I gave myself a silver bullet and an impossible challenge, be absolute every day for a year and after legit trying I then would not feel regret ending my life. I do this because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to rest peacefully knowing I didn‚Äôt at least try for my dad to get better. I also feel like I have not been living my best life and it would be a shame If I could have been someone. During this time I have learned a few things, 

1. This is a war for your body to fight and your brain has to guide, do not fight against depression and your thought, just keep acting on your framework, let your body execute your framework and let your brain scream all it wants. to get you started, create your day with best practices, putting things back properly, making your bed brushing your teeth allocating time to hobbies etc. Now you have to go robot mode at the start to beat the worst thing of all, resistance. If your eyes see something, put your hand on it, see dirty dishes or garbage, put it where it belongs. Keep doing this, let your brain give yourself a written framework and your body executed it until you feel comfortable in action.

2. Next is important, a 2 day rule, if you do not get something done and things slide, do not give up and get back on your path, do it the next day and forgive yourself, if you slip you will feel prone to giving up, like I just missed a workout with no excuse yesterday and didn‚Äôt put away my clothing as it was 11pm when it finished and I was tired, I am going to get it done this morning and try and not leave things for tomorrow me. Try and not leave things for tomorrow, do things to help tomorrow you, set out tomorrow‚Äôs clothing on the dresser, prepare food for yourself. With self love, you have to do the small things like you are doing it for a loved one, your significant other, your child or family member, you would do anything for them, I would die for any of them, yet it‚Äôs hard to live for them. remember to reward yourself with progress, I‚Äôm getting myself headphones next week as I continue to progress as mine are currently 10 years old and the mic recently doesn‚Äôt work anymore. 

3. Just do it, and keep doing it on the days where you feel like crumbling from the inside and want to die. You are suffering either way, atleast here you can be somewhat proud that you are doing something about it to change. And remember you still have that silver bullet waiting for you, if you be absolute every day and still hate everything about everything after a year of being the best you you can be, then you still have that peace in knowing it will be over soon. So just do it, what‚Äôs honestly the worst that can happen? Death hahahahahhahaha I accept it, it‚Äôs the closest thing to living, where your ego has nowhere to go but to face death itself. That‚Äôs living in that last moment. 



Being 3 months in I have learned in action a lot about self care and my depression. This has helped me a great deal, it has made me feel happier and better about myself and my place in this existence.
Life is Groundhog Day that compounds, it‚Äôs the daily efforts that compound into doing something great, seeing constant progress that YOU created is insane, you can CHANGE things around you. Want that perfect body? Train your body daily and over time out of the marble slowly chipped away comes the statue of David. Practicing guitar, I‚Äôm learning 2 to 3 songs a week now, just learned wish you were here - pink Floyd. Learning that you can change the world with small efforts daily leads to greatness and greatness then becomes a habit. Soon enough you will start to become interested in pushing yourself through greater and greater controlled discomfort, it‚Äôs mind over body and your brain gets stronger, when your body doubts and your brain makes your body the bitch, take the coldest shower you can and control your breath and keep your heart rate down, take a long sauna and focus on the hot air going in your lungs, lift heavier and heavier weights more often, you are lifting the worlds weight off your chest with every rep and getting stronger to fight it."
depression,flrmwvi,t3_fqqi0s,1585423523.0,"Well what is depression to you? It‚Äôs a little different for everyone, how much it takes your life over etc? Would you describe it as being colorblind to the world?"
depression,fllw3nw,t3_fpn1eb,1585268978.0,"How did you tell her? Did you drop it all at once? I see it like this, See you got to treat it like fishing, they want to feel like they are helping. You have to be broad and they ask questions or ask you to elaborate, if you drop everything at once like a nuke, it makes it look like you already know what your issues are and you are ignoring doing anything about it, keeping it in and creating a resistance like a fish trying to get the lure while they try and pull you in and comfort you. That‚Äôs the way I see it when it comes to talking with others. It becomes a bonding moment of give and take"
depression,flh57vl,t3_fotxgh,1585156314.0,Move over to weed and then get off weed
depression,fla3mar,t1_fl9skqx,1584975892.0,"I‚Äôll tell you a bit about myself, I grew up in a small town with not much to it, I got my first job during highschool to get me out of the house as much as possible as my parents were going through a divorce, bullying and brother was one of the biggest at the time, we are good now. I worked closing kitchen shifts at mcdonalds and other kitchen positions around town so I could save up for a place and school and move out, it was hard but worth it, I went for an it course at a college in the city, I am now living with some nice roommates, have a good sized room that feels like home to me, i am working in the government through fswep program in my field getting paid decently and will increase when I‚Äôm full time and not in school. I am independent from my parents, I don‚Äôt need a dime from them. Things you should do if you want to change your situation, 

1, get a job and keep reapplying to other places, keep upgrading your resume. Do a paper route and save that money.

2, do the right things with the money, if you plan to do school, save every dime and nickel, leech off others Netflix or shared Spotify accounts, it adds up my dude and people don‚Äôt really care, there are a ton of rich kids these days that you will meet. You can save like over 250 a year.
Food: chicken eggs fish beef veggies and learn how to make it, cook at home NOW, I got roommates that can‚Äôt make kraft dinner for their life. It will make you look attractive when you can prepare a beautiful meal trust me and could be a career path too. 
Savings account such as a tfsa or Roth IRA, it will fucking add up hardcore my dude even more so at a young age like yourself open ASAP and fill it up, dedicate enough per pay check(eg tfsa is 6k this year so do 500 a month of you can spare it, I started at 50 a month personally and I wish I did more, check out graham Stephan yt to learn more, get a emergency fund up to 4 months and use if you lose work or emergency comes up only, not for anything but that, I‚Äôm sure a ton of people wished they had one during these times.... 

Finances fuel your extra things like sports hobbies and even a car if you need to, on that get your g license a s a p just to have it even if you do not plan to drive soon. if you are in the city, use the bus. I am 21 in the city, without a car, I don‚Äôt need it. It‚Äôs a want and convenience. 

Keeping active is very important for your mental so exercise and train, play an instrument and read. Try something new, go see a new place Don‚Äôt sink into vices so it‚Äôs your primary, it also makes you a boring person to the other sex if that‚Äôs all you do such as play games watch Netflix and smoke weed all the time, anybody can do that.

Talk to your guidance counselor for what you may be interested in, if you like art and it makes you happy, practice every day and make art now. If you like cars, ask to help out at an auto shop or do the auto shop class. If you like computers, insane amount of free online or really cheap like sub 50 dollar courses like a coding course for python or c etc. If you don‚Äôt like coding look into admin work and networking, just as fun or challenging at some levels and same if not better pay at times. 

This is a lot to think about but you have to figure out what you want out of life and marathon in that direction, it‚Äôs not going to be a sprint, it‚Äôs not going to be always about the destination, it‚Äôs going to be about the journey, a hero‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt sunshine and rainbows. Imagine if Mario found the princess in the first castle, would be a boring game right? Obstacles are made to be overcome as hard as it may sound. But once you get past them and have your eye on the princess, it becomes worth it. If you work hard enough you can litterally achieve anything, if a human has done it you can do it too, if you think you can surpass or create a new thing even better. Look at Elon musk and creating rockets that land, tunnels to speed up traffic, solar power for millions and billions of people. It‚Äôs not far fetched ideas, he just set his path and marathoned until it became reality and if you become persistent, the resistance and adversity you face goes away."

depression,fl9ybcg,t3_fniv9o,1584972410.0,"Depression is like being color blind, you may see all the beautiful colours of the world yourself, but they don‚Äôt. Nothing brings that joy anymore, see a normal person would want to go on a walk in the park during fall and see the trees change color, but why would a color blind person want to go do that. It becomes indifferent to them. With depression it does not stop there, you stop enjoying things because essentially the return on effort is not there, nothing becomes rewarding and it can snowball to the point someone is bed ridden for days on end or they blow their brains out. You start regressing from activities because it‚Äôs too much effort to smile and be happy around all the colourful leaves, when you just don‚Äôt see it.  Social events are just mask tests to see if you can fake being happy for others and to keep an image that you are okay. Now let‚Äôs continue to hobbies and activity, unless you truly love a sport, even at that, the effort to keep up training, the social mask, and playing the sport itself feels like a bad return on effort, all that to kick a ball on this pointless colourless rock fuck that. That kind of idea. Now vices come into play, hate work and your life and you realize you have to do that for 30 to 40 years just to get a home? Just drink yourself under the table or use weed, if you are going to use any substance, please use weed, it‚Äôs the safest and easiest to get off of. Nutrition also dies, why eat boring veggies when you can have pizza pockets chips chocolate pasta and other tasty things, at this point, most people are looking to feel okay or well... something rather than be numb. Activities and chores that take some time for a minimal reward that normal people would be fine with would be out of the picture, after using weed alcohol food porn video games and Netflix, those vices flood your brain with dopamine and serotonin, making your brain resistant to those feel good signals, in turn making even porn food drugs spending  sprees and alcohol feel pointless. At this point you are at limbo, your only peace is sleeping, when you don‚Äôt have to live this living hell, so you do that, you fast because food is pointless at this point. You have at this point socially mentally and physically cut yourself off from the world, now you have 3 options, find an out that works for you, gunshot jumping exit bag pills train or clean your room. Continue what you are doing, exist on the brink of what‚Äôs considered living. You are at the gates of nihilism and you are facing the facts, to be or not to be that is the question, there is one more path and that‚Äôs cleaning your room, you have at this point gone through hopefully the worst suffering you have ever experienced, sorry to those who have this and had terrible things happen to them, but that means it can only get better, you have been through the worst suffering you could ever put yourself into so actually you are stronger to actually face the world. If you are in this situation out there, do a dopamine fast search up snake diet dopamine fast this will save your fucking life, if you ever see you are tripping over your shoe laces tie them up and keep walking, do a dopamine fast and tie up your shoe laces, stop tripping yourself until you have a concussion from falling so much lol. This will be the hardest thing you ever do to get out of this kind of depression, this is the depression I know best, there are other kinds that make you function still, able to produce at work, upkeep social events and activities but you don‚Äôt see why you keep doing these things over and over again. Hopefully you can follow how terrible the rip current can be if you get sucked in, and people just say lol just exercise. It‚Äôs really hard to just cold turkey change when you have litterally 0 will to breathe but your body just keeps going. That‚Äôs why I suggest you start small and do routines you can do while at the lowest low and build a foundation over time, start by making your bed after you get up, max 30 mins lying in bed after you wake up at the start, get out and make your bed and DO not get back in. Reward yourself with a tea, reminder to only use coffee when you are awake and alert, it‚Äôs like putting a turbo on a tuned engine vs putting a turbo on an engine that has combustion issues. Idk bad analogy but still tea for tired days. Now start with trying to touch the ceiling and even touching your toes, that‚Äôs your baseline every day. You cannot pass go and collect 200 unless you make your bed and stretch that day, now add in veggies eggs chicken, don‚Äôt get carbs yet because that‚Äôs a slippery slope to sugary foods. Proteins and veggies. Add in vitamin d if you are in winter, a must. Drink only water, tea or coffee(the least of the 3) now read or listen a book or articles even videos for self help, elisha long is a good resource so is Jordan Peterson and Alan watts. But above all that is Cole Robinson, it‚Äôs no bullshit framework to make your body healthier. So right now your brain is faster than your body, you need to sync them back up again, start exercising and then meditating, you are speeding up your body‚Äôs potential up to your brains potential, you think because you have energy, it‚Äôs like a manual transmission, get your body into the right rpm and then shift into the next gear and drop the clutch. Get your body‚Äôs channels running and then drop the clutch and meditate in this gear, your body mind connection is stronger now. There are two of you, the body and mind, your mind needs a friend. Get your mind and body doing activities together, mend the relationship, use your body today to be kind to your mind tomorrow, like setting out clothing for tomorrow, keeping the room clean before you go to bed so mind tomorrow doesn‚Äôt have to worry about it, leave treats for yourself. I like bakers dark chocolate so I leave myself a square every once in a while for the next day. For a cool tip for food issues like binging, if you are going to treat yourself, treat yourself a day after and portion out your treat accordingly if you want. You could even leave yourself notes to realign your mindset, I use the phrase ‚Äòwe winnin‚Äô as in my mind and body are winning when they work together. I remind myself of the connection when I start thinking bad thoughts. Now this is the fun part, life is a series of processes, if you can optimize the processes and leave the mental effort behind and trust the process you have set in place, you can literally perfect different parts of your life, want washboard abs, follow a framework for food and exercise to get you there, want to learn guitar, practice the base chords and strumming patterns and add them together like the body and mind. I am on the back end of my depression and have started this phase, down 100lbs + from snake diet framework and have a bench press in my room to keep me active daily and progressing to a stronger body and mind connection, soon enough you can use your mind to push your body‚Äôs potential ability such as running and keep running through the pain, it‚Äôs but an input and you can just ignore the pain or embrace it, this is about depression, I could write another whole thing on (social) anxiety and self hate and self Sabotage and eating issues body image and acceptance issues. Thank you for reading if you did, I hope something I said might help someone in their journey back to the present from being stuck in the past or future"

depression,fl93hi3,t3_fnd2jk,1584939808.0,"I am going through the same issue and have been learning along the way. Everything does feel like a chore until it becomes a habit. See how you perceive tasks has been very interesting to me. Let me give you a glimpse of how good it could be, you know when you get in the car and you just drive, there is no resistance to doing it, you just get in and drive nothing to it. That can start to happen to other things in your life. You just do things without second thought. 
   I have been changing my habits and how I approach every task, to optimize its process and make it more automatic and flow through the day. I have learned to reward myself and highlight some parts of the process I like. This helps with self love, because I have a lot of self hate to counter and to love others fully you have to love yourself first. I set up my day to focus on the parts of the day I like, I try to prepare a good day for myself tomorrow, in your own way pamper/treat yourself. 
   I learned that things that keep me connected to my body and surroundings make me happier. My perfect day is an early morning with easy wins, every day I make my bed properly PRO Tip drinking tea when tired and coffee when alert and read a book, a cold shower or warm shower depending on how I‚Äôm feeling that day, get dressed with prepared outfit from the night before, go for a walk around the block or sitting outside while reading as an alternative if it‚Äôs nice out. I would then move that momentum to doing work from home or schoolwork. Taking breaks to practice guitar and exercise at home, I love the pump and the cold shower after any exercise, it reminds me of doing fire wood and other work at the cottage I grew up at. I get tomorrow me nutritious and tasty meals along with treats like bakers dark chocolate or nuts or get a cut of steak. All in moderation. Write out your perfect day for me. What would make your day a little bit better if you did it? And don‚Äôt say suicide lmaoü§£
   https://youtu.be/MR26Y5Gk_H8(if you are still reading watch this, it helps me redirect myself. You are at the gates of something, most likely nihilism like me, clean your room is an option and frankly it‚Äôs a good choice if you are like a deer in the headlights to life like me. It‚Äôs been hard but you know how you would love a significant other, you would want to protect them and take care of them and do anything for them. Do that for yourself and it will shine outwards with time. 
   During this quarantine I‚Äôm sure it has reminded everyone on how much action is taken for granted. Keep active, clean your place if you have to, you will feel better and satisfied you accomplish it. You need to keep your body and brain in sync, it‚Äôs like a diver controlling his pressure to stay floating at a desired depth, you need to move more if your brain is talking more. Meditation is slowing your brain down to your body. Exercise speeds your body up to your brain. Get your body caught up to your brains speed and capability, give it work to do, learn something new. Meditation is good when you do it after doing activity like school or exercising, an instrument, or learning something new. It relaxes your thought, let the thoughts come and go like the breath. 
   Thank you for reading if you did, this took me way to long for me to finally make the jump and it‚Äôs scary to keep going when shit hits the fan after dealing with previous attempts over the years, loss of family that died to suicide, anxiety and depression and some youth trauma, self confidence and insecurities, these things have kept me productive with a better understanding of myself and who I am in this world and others around me and what this existence is or what I want to believe it is. I have so many more tips or perspective but I‚Äôve already written a short Novel so far so I‚Äôll leave it at this.

Secondly I would say find a smaller girl, but it‚Äôs up to you. But you should not stress about your height and keep comparing yourself to others, believe it or not, tall guys aren‚Äôt all players and or get girls, it‚Äôs like a room with a slightly higher ceiling, which will not matter if you build your room right or rather personality.

Optimize your time and processes and you will will be able to achieve anything. If you want to get ripped, train with a framework and eat with a nutritional framework. Optimize your finances, put away money for yourself down the road and have that compound Just like your daily efforts."
depression,fkmstrt,t1_fkmrtvc,1584338733.0,"Also to add to this, approach a conversation or interaction with compassion and empathy as you would a friend and family member. Put yourself in their shoes. They are living as you are and may also be going through stuff in their life or stuck in their mind, treat everyone as family. Now with that the most rewarding thing is you get to learn about them. It‚Äôs nice to talk about yourself and get your opinion out there, but you already know about yourself and your opinions so don‚Äôt you think it gets boring. Get interested about people, you will notice these cool quirks and things that are unique to them, they will surprise you in many ways."
depression,fkms39c,t3_fjfyjy,1584337962.0,"Do some basic stretches each day, touch your toes touch the ceiling and do a few crunches. Harmless enough that there should be no resistance and harm to doing that. Now add more and more activities one by one. Once you have a consistent body weight routine you do each morning, start looking to go to the gym and creating a positive routine there. There is no emotion without motion."

love,fkmk9ya,t3_fj8nej,1584331178.0,"Very true, it helps me get back on track mentally. When I get to low points(depression) I like to think about good memories with those I love and care about, it makes me smile and makes me content with how I feel because in those moments when I spend time with family, I feel okay and happy. You know how you feel comfortable and caring to a family member or best friend, it‚Äôs amazing to treat each person and interaction like that. You think about family and friends, smile and treat each person like you would family. It has changed my outlook on life. Learn about others, it‚Äôs really rewarding!"
depression,fkkt0hb,t3_fj44jl,1584291317.0,"Been there done that, and guess what that‚Äôs the best thing you could have done, they all care about you, it‚Äôs ovb your sister would message your parents, what would you do in her situation. Okay maybe she could have kept it to herself but still. How it went down for me was new years evening drinking myself under the table and had a friend taking care of me while I was puking my guts out and I confided in that friend, my friend asked my brother was also at that house party for help, me and my bro are 1 year apart for context and he found out and brought me home and told our parents but kept out the details thankfully. I was out of it that night. I noticed looking back that they all cared about me and loved me. They just wanted to make sure I was okay. I realized how horrible it must feel for my mother, having a gift of a child that no longer wants the gift of life. You need to be strong for them, think about the people around you helping you at times of helplessness and suffering, through your best and worst having to attend your funeral. You need to try and do everything in your power to find an answer or peace. I am as of this month through 9 self help books, going to church. Learning about science and mathematics and fundamentals and theories about our existence. Meditation and focusing on my thoughts and using a thought journal. Every day gets easier. It compounds but you have to let it grow. You cannot plant a crop and pull it up and check it‚Äôs progress, you have to keep giving it nutrients sun and water until the crop grows. Same thing for you. Learn and cope better each day and you will be fruitful, I am starting to see the effects myself. Talk to them and explain what you are going through, depression is like being colourblind, you cannot see the colours yet others are confused on why you are not amazed by the beauty of the world. When you feel this way, the return on effort falls, you stop seeing the point of playing guitar, studying, exercising, reading and learning. The world can feel like a sick joke that everything becomes a painful task. It becomes too much effort for little to no satisfaction, you start to understand the peaks or highs of things, food starts to taste more meh, like it‚Äôs just something we have to do, eat. You know what the peak of drugs feels like and it‚Äôs just not that good anymore, you know what masturbation feels like and you know the effort to jerk off is not worth the reward and the terrible feeling after. The colour is gone from the world. What I suggest you try is a dopamine fast(check out snake diet dopamine fast and do it trust me(read during this time and learn), I personally got out of this stage from a dopamine fast and implementing positive long term habits I stick to daily and weekly. From there you should do everything you can to learn about what this existence really is and find your truth. Your reason and burning fire to be alive, I find mine is to love care and provide for others as a father figure. I learned life is not about you. It‚Äôs about others! It took me 21 years to learn that and truly live by it, I was so self absorbed in my own issues, depression  and anxieties I forgot to think about anyone else. It‚Äôs what you can do for others that means a lot, help out with chores to make their day easier, I help with roommates dishes and other cleaning chores, make nice bountiful nutritious meals for friends and family. When I talk to someone I try to learn about them and put myself in their shoes. It‚Äôs about caring and helping those around you. You know how  horrible suffering can get, now imagine if you could help someone in your situation or just make someone‚Äôs day easier or a little better, would you not try to help them? Look it‚Äôs scary, but it‚Äôs scarier to give up and not try to see it out. Even more with corona and all these terrible stressful things going, we need to help calm and reassure those around us."
depression,fkjlt46,t3_fiwchm,1584250043.0,"Have you been hitting any goals recently? Have you been actively working at it and as much as you know you can or should? If you feel no contentment as of right now, what actions in your life that can be changed or focused on that may better your situation. Throwing in the gloves will not solve it. It‚Äôs trial and error, start testing and developing your hypothesis this week on what is making you feel less content with your life. Could be dopamine issues or both if above does not apply as much, make sure to control your nutrition, exercise, drug and alcohol use, phone/tech/video games and media binging and overuse to abuse. Masturbation if kept to once or twice a week is good enough but you can look into no fap communities, if no fap becomes a challenge or struggle. Just don‚Äôt bother, you have to have the mindset that it‚Äôs only for Love and reproductive purposes and that if there is not a SO there you don‚Äôt need to do it. Garlic cloves at night creates tents in the morning pro tip"
depression,fkhlzoy,t3_fikek2,1584201630.0,"We exist to take action. Everything we do takes time and our action. If you want to get high, you take action and follow a procedure aka put weed in bowlpiece. Same thing for anything. If you want love, if you want to be a provider you should create a fundamental baseline of actions to provide and take care of your family. Shelter/clothing food/water etc. Basically it‚Äôs a 1 up global context to be better at something than someone else. Why do you think nice cars and homes exist.  You get rewarded back by society by how much your actions impact the world. It‚Äôs all about taking care of those around you and trying new things. We are masters of depression, we know we will die and we invite it, sooo why are we not living, why are we not skydiving cliff diving doing all that shit. If you can carefully select and optimize your daily actions to focus on achieving a goal with milestones you can hit on your timeline, you can literally do anything. Want to have a washboard chest? Clean nutrition and training. Want to succeed in your field? Do online training and look for extra online certifications? Want to learn as much as you can about our existence? Look into all religions and also science and nature."
depression,fkhkn80,t3_fik5qo,1584200879.0,"Everyone is feeling anxiety over my situation, my roommate or even myself couldn‚Äôt hit rent if they closed government and private sector down for non essential functions. But we also know it‚Äôs god like circumstances where we have no control over. People will give free housing and they will rehire as many people as they can if not bring on more. The stock market has been bullish for so long that it‚Äôs finally going to get reset to how things should be valued like the housing market issue, sad but frankly corona kills off the elderly that has all the wealth, might help that market. Dark but true. 3.3 trillion of wealth is being transferred to beneficiaries annually even before corona and depending on how governments react might be faster big rip to boomers. It‚Äôs a wake up call frankly. Imagine if it happened to be more infectious and more lethal to the general population. This is just almost like a super flu causing issues to those in old age or health complications. Keep to yourself and wash your hands and think of your grandparents when you do that, because that‚Äôs who you would be saving."
depression,fkhjc1u,t3_fik0ed,1584200157.0,"Hold on to that feeling of love purpose and belonging and understand that the feeling will come back if you ever lose focus. Remember you cannot expect happiness out of another person but you can find comfort trust empathy love intimacy.

depression,fkfm2ch,t3_fi637i,1584137427.0,"Look, it‚Äôs already spreading so you do what you can instead of being paralyzed by the fear. Do things that lighten the mood for those around you. Right now is the time we can show empathy and be compassionate to others that are worrying and reassure them it will be okay because in time it will be okay. I am looking to plant a garden and I am starting to plant the seedlings, I plan to bring in a bountiful feast for me and my roommates/apartment building. Bringing in some fresh grown veggies and herbs for a home made family recipe meal will help ground people and create a sense of community. Picking up the weight when people are too stressed to do something. Help them with dishes, sweeping and cleaning around the house and take pride in how you present your area. Get a movie night going, play smash bro‚Äôs or Mario cart, just talk about nothing. Get this shit off people‚Äôs mind because the media is doing a fucking sorry ass job at keeping people calm. Do what you need to do, keep your hands clean and don‚Äôt touch your face! Self isolate, just don‚Äôt go out much like it‚Äôs not hard. Who actually goes shopping twice a week anyways."

SuicideWatch,fkej9as,t1_fke6gnn,1584114332.0,"You mind if I ask what makes you get out of bed each day? What is worth it to you in the end to fight all this pain and struggle? Is it to become successful? Is it to be the best provider you can be to those around you? Is it just to keep on going just so your family isn‚Äôt sad? Is there a hobby you actually enjoy and would suffer the whole week or month just to do it? Is it to live in spite because you are fucking afraid of the thought of death and suicide yet suicide is comforting because you can choose how you die instead of dying a horrible final destination styled death. Do you live so you can bring children into this world? Are you here for a divine purpose or have faith in something greater? What keeps you tied and grounded to this existence here? Like legit question because The only answer that‚Äôs true is I am still alive because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint and hurt my family. My dad is an amazing person and he does not deserve to lose a kid, but I don‚Äôt deserve my family, they are just too wholesome and good for this world to ruin them."
