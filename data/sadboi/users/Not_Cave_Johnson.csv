BPD,f3wnfgt,t3_czwcod,1571210484.0,"I remember as a child starting at around age 6 when my parents got divorced and we moved to my grandmothers and that's when I would always tell my mom I wanted to go home, she would always ask where home was and I couldn't explain it, it was just away. home was being gone. this went on up until I was about 16, we moved back in with my father when I was 10. I hadn't said it again until I was 19 and had a break and ended up back in a psych unit where I was diagnosed with BPD and was broken up with in the unit. researched BPD when I got out the unit and understood everything I had been feeling and going through for years. A month after I got out the unit I got a job saved money and moved 1000 miles away. I still feel the need to go ""home"" sometimes but I am the happiest I have ever been. also feels great to finally know I'm not alone with this"
