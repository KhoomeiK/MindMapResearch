depression,fip0uxi,t1_fiorqor,1582595499.0,"Thank you so much for responding, and also thank you for the advice and support, I really appreciate it. 

I don’t really have any desire to graduate from this specific college I’m currently attending; I just think (well, I really don’t know) that it would look better to be a graduate of this college because of its better rankings and apparently stronger reputation (at least here in the south). I also don’t have any particular field I want to enter into at the moment. I am completely undecided and currently an undeclared major. Probably going to be something in the humanities or some social science since I’m really bad at STEM.

Yeah I’ve acknowledged I can’t go back in the past and can’t change the past, yet it still hurts me and makes me sad, like I still just can’t get over it as it always just finds a way to force itself back into the forefront of my mind (when it’s not just otherwise bouncing around, if that makes sense), so I guess maybe I haven’t entirely acknowledged it. But the grief concept sounds interesting and I’ll try looking into it more, thanks. I’m glad it helped you!"

At some point though the time will come to “do” something, I think. I recently read this thing today that talked about how depression isn’t something you can overcome, just like how you can’t just overcome being overweight; it’s a constant struggle, just like how you can’t just go back to your old eating habits or else you’ll just gain all that weight back, so you gotta be considerate of your eating habits. And eventually it’ll get easier but there’ll be times that it’ll get hard again. That’s what keeps me going anyway, got me through today, so I guess it’s don’t always feel bad about it, it just starts at being aware of it in the first place. Good luck"

Somehow. That’s at least what I’ve been thinking lately. So it’s not as simple as just saying “oh I’ll be happy now” or whatever, cause I think that’s disingenuous and an oversimplification, but there still is a solution.... somehow. Just have to figure out what it is. Which is harder to do if it’s more complicated, but its still out there somewhere and needs to be grabbed. If that makes any sense."

I hear the usual “go join clubs” and all that but it’s just really hard for me, I either don’t have the energy or motivation (even though I don’t want to be lonely) to go out, or when I do start thinking about it or walking I freeze up (literally both physically and mentally) and get super anxious and just can’t bring myself to go through with it. Or otherwise I’m just really busy with classes and I can’t find any clubs I’d be interested in anyway.

lonely,fhrna1b,t3_f4bg7s,1581831316.0,"I think it’s really difficult making online friendships bc irl communication is more than just words, you know?

Plus it’s less personal since you don’t see their face; heck, even when you do over a camera or something, it’s still not as personal since you’re both still looking into a screen and not actually there.

With that being said, I don’t want to mislead anyone but encourage by saying I met one of my closest friends ever online, and I only ever talked with him online. We don’t talk much anymore but that’s really because college caught up to us, and it was just harder to talk online while doing college things. He might move to the U.S. though (goes to college in Canada) and we want to meet up one day. We’ve both changed a lot though so idk if it would be the same as the old days, but those days still happened, and they could for you too!"

There are days when I seem like I just accept being lonely and it doesn’t phase me, but there are other days when I’m crying over it or other days where I just feel kinda empty or sad on the inside. I go back and forth. Usually regardless though I get sad by the end of the days, at night, when I’m about to go take a shower and go to bed. Just wanted to relate.

You might not wanna read this, it may come across as rude and that’s not at all my intention, I’m just sort of ranting, so just a heads up. But I remember I told one of my friends back home (I’m a lonely college student and was lonely before, although I was lucky to have made a couple friends in HS who I still talk to) that I honestly didn’t even care about being lonely (at my college) anymore, like I just accepted it and moved on, and he just said that’s pathetic lol.

I’m lame honestly and don’t have anything impressive to say that comes to mind lol. Best thing I can think of is that I ate with someone for the first time in the dining hall (I go to college, freshman). It wasn’t by my initiation or anything, she actually invited me which I thought was crazy (I go to a small college and we’ve had like 4 classes together by complete coincidence so that’s how we know each other). The whole time I was completely anxious and when I got back to my room afterwards I just had to take a breather. I found that I wasn’t even that happy about it in the end for some reason, but I guess I’m still proud of the fact itself that I finally ate with someone. Of course I’m an awkward and anxious shit and I didn’t even talk to her the next day and I felt really bad bc I know friendships all about reciprocation and she had invited me and I should’ve just gone up to her and been like hey what’s up, but I just couldn’t. Idk why, can’t explain it. I tend to overthink things and just freeze up when it comes to virtually any social context. But yeah hey that happened."
lonely,fhoa55a,t3_f3wyhd,1581747064.0,"I’m 19, turning 20 this year. I’ve had ups and downs in my loneliness. I was lonely for almost all of my life, I had maybe one or two friends at a time, but at the end of middle school I somehow really hit it off with this guy and we just became good friends, and he sort of became an “in” for me in a social group in high school. It wasn’t until like halfway through my junior year I even started hanging out with them, but yeah it was really nice. Now I’m in college and I went to a small school OOS and I’m back to being lonely again. It really hurts this time because I could’ve dormed with some friends at another instate college, but I just kept hearing how much it’s a mistake to do that. In my mind I wasn’t really “following” them to college in my mind bc there was no particular college I wanted to go to, I’m completely undecided on what I wanna do in life so it wasn’t like I’d be giving up, say, some good program to follow a girlfriend (the classic “following someone to college” scenario) but admittedly maybe it would still have been following them anyway. I still have some friends from back home, but only a couple really. I don’t think it will ever change because I’ve always been shy and I can’t get better, although I’ll admit I could get lucky again like I did in high school. And that could happen to you too! 

Weekends are the worst at my school not only because I’m deathly alone but there isn’t even anything to do here on the weekends. Even the social people say that. I mean it wouldn’t make any difference for me bc if there was stuff happening then it would just be in the background for me if you know what I mean, but still, there’s not even that opportunity. I end up FaceTiming a good friend of mine actually (one of the guys I could have dormed with), but we’re both lonely and anxious and depressed and we spend our weekend time talking about it. I’ll admit I’m very lucky and privileged just to have one person and I don’t take that for granted, I know a lot of people here have no one and I’m sorry. It still sucks though. I just constantly regret going here. Thinking about transferring but idk. Anyway we FaceTime all day on weekends but we both just sit around and do nothing lol. Sometimes play a video game.

depression,fhbqir9,t3_f20mkv,1581447732.0,"Holy fuck this speaks to me incredibly. I was one of those smart and quiet kids, best in elementary, top in middle school, and top 40 (I think? can’t remember exactly, but around that) in high school in terms of GPA. I struggle to focus and often procrastinate but I got my work done and I got good grades throughout my public school career, but also was quiet, shy, sort of withdrawn. I began to think that my “shyness” was something more (e.g. social anxiety) in early high school and it sort of made me lose focus on academics in pursuit of a greater social life that I had missed out on, and while I made a solid friend group and still kept good grades, I never really developed any social skills, personality, or personal hobbies or interests of my own other than joking around with (some of) my friends, playing games, watching videos, and sometimes smoking and drinking. And now I’m in college OOS and I’ve realized that I don’t have those people skills and don’t have any sense of self. I’m like a leech; when I had no friends in my earlier childhood years, I was quiet and reserved, and when I (sort of) became part of a friend group in my latter high school years, my personality and maybe even identity was tied to them. I thought going to college OOS would help me develop my own identity, but it’s actually just making me stagnant because now I’m depressed (or sad, maybe, I don’t even know if I’m really depressed or just exaggerating and I feel like an asshole for using that word bc I know people really struggle with genuine depression, so I’m sorry) and not willing or able to go try out things. I have no friends here and I can’t just “join clubs” because 1) I have no interest in any of the clubs here (I also go to a small school, like under 2000 students), and 2) social anxiety and constant distracting negative thinking. Thinking about transferring closer to home where some of my old friends are; might seem like a mistake on paper, might even be a mistake (drop off in prestige, going back to old friends, etc.) but I also feel it could at least give me some confidence just to be able to do those other people things. Like networking and stuff like that. I don’t know and I’m really lost and it feels like a hole because I’ve realized my entire life up to this point has culminated in this, but I just wanted to say I can relate, you’re not alone although I hope you are doing than I am or will do better than me, which I’m sure you will! But it’s also incredibly relieving knowing that I’m not alone too, because I’ve had this same thought as of lately.  

Was the quiet and smart kid throughout school, now got no social or people skills, so while I can still get decent grades (usually), not doing so well in other aspects of college."

Would you say GSU is not worth applying to transfer for or consider?
