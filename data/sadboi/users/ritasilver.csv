HealthAnxiety,fa8j4g2,t1_fa8ixym,1575847436.0,"I don't know how it works in the USA, but independently of the blood test not being specific, if you had such a serious infection, your simple blood panel would be all over the place."
HealthAnxiety,fa8iaq9,t1_fa8i4w8,1575846883.0,Find a second opinion if it helps you to ease your concerns. Anything that may help you is valid.
HealthAnxiety,fa8hnbz,t3_e80ggo,1575846456.0,"The itch happens when a wound is healing. I work with animals for 15 years now and live with animals too. I've been bitten loads of times and it really itches when it's healing, like any other scar.
I understand that probably in your country you don't have national health service (free) like in mine, but if you can go to any doctor or urgent care, tell them all the story and they will probably take you some blood to check if you're fine and you will be calmer about this."
HealthAnxiety,fa8h016,t1_fa8csa7,1575846034.0,"Rabies is much faster to get you. Really, it's not likely to be rabies. You probably have a cold, but if it makes you feel safer, go to another doctor. I totally understand your fear, believe me. Do you have a fever? Is the scratched area infected?"
HealthAnxiety,fa8c7fu,t3_e80ggo,1575844260.0,"You don't have any symptoms and/or wounds, right? 
Time enough has passed, really, try not to worry."
HealthAnxiety,f8wizoz,t3_e2hb45,1574891885.0,"I understand you so very well. I keep thinking I will be one of those ""oh she told us, she was right"", one of those negligent cases in the news. My therapist tells me ""allow yourself to be mainstream"". But it's so hard. . ."
HealthAnxiety,f7r9z36,t3_dxcc7i,1573977511.0,"Hi. Please go see the doctor (or any medical staff in the ship) so you can be helped until the trip ends. I understand very well the feeling of despair. Then, when you get home, please seek specialized help so you can balance your levels and have a better quality of life. You deserve to have some peace. Please don't do anything to harm yourself, seek help.
Sending you a big hug."
HealthAnxiety,f6sm87k,t1_f6slu8x,1573136465.0,"Great to read that. You are old enough to be my daughter ( lol, although I feel young), but we are equals, all in the same boat. I am glad I could help. 
I am struggling here, you are struggling there.

HealthAnxiety,f6sl9w5,t3_dsxeyf,1573136005.0,"Hi. Everything influences on our period, really. Stress, eating disorders, etc. Sometimes it's just a hormonal unbalance but nothing serious, it's just a matter of balancing it, with the pill, for instance. I'm glad you went to the doctor. The only thing I would be aware of is not to get anemic due to the blood loss. Don't worry, really, it's not like super anemic, just low iron and it's solvable really really fast, believe me. Women in fertile age are always a bit low on iron, specially if we have bigger losses. I took iron supplement for 3 months and the numbers went back to normal. 
It would be great if you could talk to somebody about your anxiety. Sending you a big hug from Portugal."

HealthAnxiety,f63ftbr,t3_dq6pkz,1572676613.0,"I didn't mean to scare you, I'm sorry. I just mentioned it to tell you I understand.
I don't know if you have already done it, but it's important to have professional help.
Sorry again if I scared you."
HealthAnxiety,f612mj6,t3_dq6pkz,1572631666.0,I'm here if you need to talk. I'm 38 and struggling for more than 2 decades with this hell.
HealthAnxiety,f4m2l6g,t3_dl2l89,1571673845.0,"Hi. Good that you went to the doctor. Gastroenteritis can very well be what you have. It's very normal that the appetite takes a while to come back. It's important that you hydrate, ok, and maybe start slowly with some mashed banana or some very well cooked white rice with carrot. Millet is also good for stomach pain. As soon as you feel able to eat, you will start to gain weight again, just try to be hydrated and allow your body to recover. 
Sending you a hug all the way from Portugal."
HealthAnxiety,f4axyx5,t1_f49miml,1571503406.0,Thank you!
HealthAnxiety,f4axm3r,t3_dk4ji9,1571503254.0,I am 38 and cannot remember my life without being ruled by fear. It's overwhelming.

HealthAnxiety,f45oukl,t3_djjp2t,1571387582.0,"I totally understand you. I am also in a spiral and my life is run by fear. I just wanted to be normal. And happy. 
Please try to go and have a check up. At least maybe a little bit of the anxiety will come down. I absolutely understand the fear of finding something out, I feel the same. It's so weird how our anxious brains work.
Please feel free to vent. Sending you strength all the way from Portugal."
HealthAnxiety,f40oqas,t3_dj0h31,1571303854.0,"It's not deadly. But it's really important, as others said, to treat it sooner than later. I had one some years ago and didn't treat it (among other issues I have fear of taking things), so, things got worse and I had to go to the hospital for a shot (the relief was immediate) because it was going up to the kidney. Fortunately it didn't. But if I had treated in the beginning (like normal people do) that would have been solved quickly. Someone also mentioned cranberries. It's really good for the urinary tract. Ah and drink loads of water to wipe those bacteria away. 
Dandelion tea also helps. In any case, please go to the doctor for antibiotics.
Try to believe it's not deadly. It's annoying and painful but it's treatable."
