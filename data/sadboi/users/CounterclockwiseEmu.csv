askteenboys,fe2vbiv,t3_enm5z8,1578843281.0,"When I was 11 I was working on a school project that involved hot glue. My mom said not to use it without her being in the room, but of course I didn‚Äôt listen. I was also wearing shorts, so you can imagine where this is going. As I was working, a huge glob of hot glue fell onto my thigh. As it burned through my skin, I screamed but my mom wasn‚Äôt home at this time to hear. I tried picking it up with my hand but my hand burned too. (Again, I was a dumb kid.) So basically I had to wait for the hot glue to cool down on my thigh and hand before I could peel it off. Peeling off glue, along with a layer of my skin is one of the most excruciating painful things I‚Äôve ever experienced.  After that, it left a disgusting scar and to this day I don‚Äôt wear shorts in public."

I feel like I‚Äôm forcing them to listen to my life problems. I can‚Äôt just open up to someone like that. Social anxiety is stressful whether it‚Äôs in person or online.
