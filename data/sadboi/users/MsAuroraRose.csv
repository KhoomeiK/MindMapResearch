patientgamers,fp6znqi,t1_fp6ru1j,1588361404.0,"You can definitely play solo.  This MMO plays a lot like a single player Elder Scrolls game.  The zone quests give good rewards so you can definitely get good gear doing it that way.  If you want to run dungeons there's a dungeon finder so you can group up with people but it's not necessary.

The main story quest when you first start playing is apparently pretty epic but I haven't finished it yet.  My husband is home during the quarantine while I'm working so he's played a lot more than me by himself.

You also don't need the monthly subscription to play.. it's a quality of life improvement but it's not necessary to the core game mechanics."

Each zone has a ""main story quest"" where the quest marker looks different than the side quests.  The game only shows one quest at a time on your screen & I don't play with any mods to increase the quest list on UI since I just want to focus on one at a time.

Our thinking is we'll get through the zone quest which helps you explore the area then we'll go back and pick up more quests when we're done.  ESO scales each area to your level so it doesn't matter if you jump around or come back when you're maxed.

I grew up in a conservative religion and this sounds very similar to my group of friends who stayed with the religion in terms of ""their place"" in relation to men.  The religion was very much about women supporting their men & men do all the public work like sermons, praying, etc (basically all the talking parts). For example, women aren't usually allowed to pray or preach if there is a baptized man around.  Women are usually stuck to teaching Sunday School classes.  The only role they can take during the actual Sunday service is playing the piano or organ (and that's only if you're baptized).  you'd also get a talking to if you showed up wearing pants on Sunday instead of a dress or skirt.  I was told I should speak with the elders in the church about my beliefs when I posted some comment in 2008 about Prop 8 in California (gay marriage)

it varied by region in terms of who was more strict than others.  the churches up in the SF Bay Area were very liberal and women would pray or give talks at the small gatherings & would wear pants to Sunday service.  Australia is the most strict where girls/women *have* to wear skirts 100% of the time even while playing sports.  I stopped going 8 years ago so don't know how much it has changed.

For example:  I pay about $500/mo in premiums for myself, husband & 3 year old.  If I want to see my doctor, it's $20/visit.  If I want to go to Urgent Care it's $20/visit.  If I need to go to ER, then it's $100/visit but if I end up getting admitted to the hospital the fee is waived.  And no cost for the actual hospital stay.  $0 copay for hospital stays.  This is the best insurance I've ever had and I'm staying at this job I don't necessarily like anymore because the benefits are just so good.

I think telling the kid from the start they are adopted helped me.  My parents were religious so they phrased it as I was a ""gift from God""."

Thank you so much :)  I have a strong support system now after fumbling for a bit there.  I'm married, have a 3 year old and a husband who knows me almost better than I know myself."
GirlGamers,fmxc4io,t1_fmxbm9s,1586462261.0,I don't know if it still happens.  I don't use a mic when playing and don't play the kinds of games anymore that would have these players in them.

Thanks for the love <3"
GirlGamers,fmxbbxb,t1_fmxavkp,1586461851.0,I don't really use a mic when I play since I'm usually playing with my husband and we're sitting right next to each other.  Hardly ever play with strangers anymore.

GirlGamers,fmxarog,t3_fxx8wu,1586461563.0,My 3 year old likes watching me fish too.  He thinks I'm feeding them though.  Also wants me to show him my house.  Every time I change something up inside the house I make sure to show him.

Looking forward to an evening of fresh bud & video games :)"
GirlGamers,fmx55ym,t1_fmwy5w9,1586458649.0,I personally experienced it a lot when I was playing Call of Duty & Halo multiplayer like 10-12 years ago.  Sometimes I'd get it when I played WoW by myself but if I played with my husband (BF at the time) it wasn't like that.

18 years ago this June and each new milestone in my life reminds me how much I miss him."
SFGiants,fmu0dlc,t1_fmu039v,1586382249.0,that's just so great.  what a great era for the team.
Coronavirus,fmu03bu,t1_fmtyhd9,1586382100.0,"So far the comments I've seen have been from Michigan, Tennessee and now you in Florida.  The others have said they were able to apply but having gotten any payments yet.  I still don't know what's going to happen to my husband's job after 4/19 so I don't know if we need to apply or not.  

my anxiety has never been this constant"

My surreal baseball experience was spring training 2012 in AZ.  It started hailing during one of the afternoon games and the umps wouldn't call it."
Coronavirus,fmtyv9m,t1_fmtxwe2,1586381460.0,"That's crazy you got all that info & the card itself but still no funds.  Seems like the hard part was already done so shouldn't be too hard to just deposit money to the card? 

I'm in CA so our governor is on it but I'm worried if you're not in the first wave of people who applied there won't be any money left for those who file later.  An extra $600/week is going to help but only if you can actually get it out to people."
