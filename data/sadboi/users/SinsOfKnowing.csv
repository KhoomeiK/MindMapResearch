Anxiety,fp879vf,t3_gbnjuv,1588385314.0,"I’ve been home for 47 days because I have shit lungs and work in healthcare (admin - so I can do my full duties from home). My colleagues are super supportive and I was the first to start WFH, but I take public transit to get to work and I fear that my heart office will override our local office and mandate us all back. Our transit system has had a number of cases among drivers and maintenance staff, and there is a very real chance that if I get this virus it will kill me. I’m probably worrying needlessly, but it’s still in the back of my mind that this shit is going to be lifted too soon and we are all going to be screwed. The local government announced today that parks and trails are reopening this weekend and it seems like a crazy thing to do in the middle of a peak."

I don’t know a bunch of his friends, and some of them have weird names I assumed were nicknames, or everyone calls them their last name but I didn’t know their first name. Also husband’s last name is just about the most common in the English language, and I couldn’t keep track of which guests were family and which were random acquaintances he worked with for two weeks in high school (not joking) when I was trying to pare the list down. Rest assured - you will get through it and at the end of it all you’ll laugh at the silliness of the things you were stressed about, while marvelling at the things you somehow didn’t straight up lose your mind over."
TrollXWeddings,f5uh85b,t3_d7uz2b,1572473165.0,"There is legit a photo of me trying not to ugly cry when reading my vows. There were tears streaming and I look DEVASTATED. I was so happy but public speaking terrifies me and the emotions all caught up with me. I was able to breathe through a lot of the emotional moments and keep things in check, but I am a cryer (I literally cried at work the other day when my coworker handed me a puppy, because it was so cute and had new puppy smell). It was pretty inevitable for me.

If you are worried about streaky makeup from tears, I recommend a good makeup setting spray and waterproof mascara/eyeliner. I had my makeup done around 1pm and cried when I saw my mom all done up, was outside and in a sweaty arcade for pics in the afternoon, cried at my ceremony at 7 and danced until 1am and my makeup didn’t budge!"
