SelfAwarewolves,fqf1yc3,t1_fqd8h8d,1589317363.0,"Just to give more context: The way we do it here is that the amount of the cheapest option that still works well is paid for by the government. If you want even better then you have to pay the difference yourself. And there is still competition driving the price down as everyone wants to be the official suggested free option and get the customers, whether they get the money from the government or the people directly doesnt matter for the.."

Its not like he could either make good electrical cars or pay his employees and not endanger them, he can do both. Its not like treating them with human dignity is going to end his car manufacturing forever. Thats why he said Strawman."
kingdomcome,fqew3bm,t1_fqdpyjx,1589314556.0,"Unfortuantely there are also many issues with unionizing. In some countries the industry evwn lobbied to make it almost impossible and theres almost no structure for organizing protest and bargaining for better conditions together. I think the UK started having a game developer union only about a year ago? For example in the country that I work in, New Zealand striking etc for people working in the entertainment industry has prettt much been outlawed since the Hobbit laws. (The government was so dead set on wanting it be made here and the corporations threatened to just produce it elsewhere if employees rights werent limited that workers right were just cut in the end. We are only now starting to get some rights back through fighting for it.)"

Sure those could be cherry-picked to fit a narrative but they do explain the situation from both sides, do they not? Both from inside and from outside China. They explain why China is doing what it is and then bring their own opinion in that they think that the reason is no justification. In what way is the sub biased? Yes, I assume that most here want the best for New Zealand more than they want it for China but shouldnt that be normal?"

If you set up a maximum % of trade, wouldnt that be easily circumventable if they just use a third country to reroute their trade with us? Move the headquarter to some other country, maybe assemble the last bit elsewhere and shwoop its not made in China anymore and can be imported?"

Also, unfortuantely, while gamers seem very happy to get outraged about some games, cancel preorders, announce boycotts etc because of content in those games there usually isnt much community support for boycotting studios that treat their employees like crap. I would love if we saw some change in the future, at least I can dream."
