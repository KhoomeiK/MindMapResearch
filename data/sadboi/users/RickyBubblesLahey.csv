shittyfoodporn,fqr9zwn,t3_gk37wv,1589580370.0,"I really enjoy experimenting with my ramen. Chicken is the only flavor I‚Äôll eat, but years of eating chicken ramen makes my stomach churn so I started adding random condiments to it to improve. 

I started out with cheese. When I was about 9 I used to eat ramen with cheese on bread. 

Then I started adding eggs, onions, corn, peas. 

Recently I started adding crushed red pepper and butter, and mayo and ranch. Anything to make it creamy. 

Made a bowl for my bf, and absolutely HATES chicken ramen, but after trying a bite of my new concoction, he asked for some. 

I‚Äôm always trying to improve plain ramen."

I started in calligraphy to get my curves decent but with tagging I will just have to practice practice practice. 

I got started mostly as a side thing because my partner does wonderful tags and throw ups around the city and he‚Äôs currently trying to teach me as well so that‚Äôs why I decided to come to these subs to show what I‚Äôve started and for critique. 

And also my struggle is i write way too fast, always have even in school and can‚Äôt quite get myself to slow down. And I‚Äôm extremely heavy handed so when I want light lines I fuck that all up. I low key feel like I need to teach myself to write proper again to get this done.
