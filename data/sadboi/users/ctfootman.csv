I've recently played alot more with it docked to my TV and have noticed that my left Joy-Con is constantly showing low battery. It doesn't ever give me percentages, but lets say with it's in handheld, it's around 70% and will stay like that, and when it's docked to the TV it'll immediately go down to around 20%. Anyone had this issue/know how to fix it?

I haven't tried anything yet, first time looking around for a solution."

DIY,fmw7erw,t3_fvf8rd,1586441132.0,"I’ve just moved into my first flat, and it’s grubby. It has great potential but I just need some standard advice.

My skirting boards looks like they were stuck on badly, and there’s gaps between the skirting and the wall, can I fill it up with pollyfilla, if so what type? I googled it and there’s so many:( 

I also need to paint the skirting boards; does it have to be gloss or can it be mat and should I sand it first?

And painting walls; they’re dark walls and I want them white/cream so I know it’s going to take a lot of layers, however do I need to sand them first? 

And lastly I have wholes underneath plug sockets where the wires go into the wall, is there anyway I can safely fill those wholes up? 

Again apologies if this doesn’t belong here, and thank you in advanced for any advice I receive. Small or big is very much appreciated. I live in the UK, and am limited to what I can buy. 

Also, I have been given permission by landlord to do it up :) 

Thanks again x"

I work for an agency, so I’m on a constant 0hr contract, however I got laid of in the place I was working due to Covid-19. 
The agency I work for are refusing to furlough me. Even though there is no work going what-so ever and I live in a flat by myself. I don’t know what to do anymore 😭 
The agency said that if my place of work had not requested for me to be laid off, and it closed I would be entitled to being furloughed, but I was laid of a weekend before it closed. 
The agency still can furlough me, they just don’t want to. 
I need some help and advice please.
I appreciate it x"

Nothing ever good happened to me. I would be that person who always got stupidly jealous, like bad jealous, of people for the smallest of things. One day, I decided to have a chat with myself as I felt it was effecting my relationship. I told myself to stop being stupid. There is always someone in a worse situation as you and you should always be grateful for everything I had. 

In the end, I chilled out and good things happened. A good job, final stages of renting a flat all to myself (currently living in a shared house covered in damp and Fungi) relationship better than ever, 3 holidays booked this year.

I know it’s hard, but you have to be selfish in some situations to make sure you’re okay. It is not your responsibility to parent your adults. 

This change may also be good for them as they’ll learn that they can do things themselves. Think positively about every situation. I know that’s easier said then done but if it helps right a pros and cons list, and force yourself to focus on the positives. 

Also, if you’re the only thing from keeping your dad doing,, you know, maybe you can advice him to get some help as well? Or tell your counsellor and get them in contact with him. 

They might see their child sorting out their life and want to do the same.

When he told me I didn’t really respond, I embraced the fact that he had the courage to come out to me and his family and we celebrated his bravery. When that had all settled we sat down and had a very serious talk and I said that I couldn’t promise the outcome but I was more than happy to give it a try. That worked well for us, as it then left the relationship very clear and we quite often freely spoke about how we were feeling and updated each other on our mindset. 
We actually broke up due to unrelated issues, so maybe just sit down and speak about how you’re feeling.

However, to me this sounds like a form of Panick attack. I have multiple different forms of them. They can change the way you react. 

And with your childhood trauma, it could be a sound/smell/colour from that time that triggers this, which is why you go jumpy when people come.e near you. Your sense are heightened which is why you're feeling all these weird sensations in places.
