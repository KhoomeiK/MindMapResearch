I think of it this way. There are four pillars of your ""higher coinsciousness"" - intellect, sences, feelings and intuition. If you successfully work with some of them and some them leave undeveloped, it inevitably leads to a big crisis. 

So, what I personally do is from time to time I switch from occult practices to some down to earth learning. Sciences do well, you can also concentrate on leraning a new skill. That's how I went, for example, from ""oh we're all one, it's a big illusion"" to managing personal finances -> economics -> political philosophy which serves me quite well."
