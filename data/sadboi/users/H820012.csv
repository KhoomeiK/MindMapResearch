ptsd,ex0h31n,t3_cqunat,1565912872.0,"I'm so sorry about what happened to you.  I told my family on accident. I think my abuser got in trouble for something similar and my mom called me to tell me how grossed out she was and how he was a creep and I agreed with her. Then she started asking me questions about it. I wasn't planning on telling anyone about it. I waited 12 years for it to just slip out one day but around that time, it was something I was thinking about."
TalkTherapy,ewho66y,t1_ewho3ob,1565414884.0,"Also, mine only pointed it out because I did it and was like ""I don't know why I just did that"" and he told me that I do it all the time."
TalkTherapy,ewho3ob,t1_ewho0d2,1565414807.0,Aww I'm sorry. :/ Sometimes it's better if they don't point out certain things because you'll probably think about it too much.
TalkTherapy,ewhnp56,t1_ewhnmis,1565414353.0,Mine pointed it out to me and kinda made it a thing ðŸ˜‚
TalkTherapy,ewhilfe,t3_clw9k0,1565409230.0,"I talked about how I was afraid of talking to people because they might think I'm not smart. Or I don't deserve to be happy because I'm not smart and when I said it out loud, I realized how messed up it sounded and they told me that even if I wasn't smart, I always deserve to be happy and to have people to talk to."
TalkTherapy,ewhi9v0,t3_cocpu6,1565408935.0,I laugh and smile when I talk about things that are hard too. My therapist kept asking me how things were making me feel because my facial expressions were telling a different story. It turns out I smile and laugh to break the tension. It's a coping mechanism.
Effexor,ewfzk8h,t1_ewfhxwb,1565370649.0,I've been taking it since May. I think the problem is that I'm not drinking enough water. :/
TalkTherapy,ew3g5bb,t3_cmgzqu,1565077214.0,Mine has never cancelled any appointments.
namenerds,evzlpg5,t1_evzkcj2,1564960875.0,I love it! Thank you ðŸ˜Š
ptsd,evugxys,t3_cl8v1l,1564794972.0,Part of me wants to heal but part of me is scared to because it shows my abuser that what he did was fine. :/
TalkTherapy,eusxfoi,t1_eurkzlf,1564015516.0,It's funny because mine always won ðŸ˜‚ They play the games so much that they learn every possible situation haha
TalkTherapy,eusxbwp,t3_ch9fly,1564015454.0,"I played connect 4, a card game, and a couple others with mine. I didn't feel comfortable at first and doing something that for my mind off of how awkward the whole situation was made me able to open up more."
ptsd,euruuzs,t3_ch7fq0,1563999267.0,"I understand how you feel! I also feel extremely uncomfortable when people bring up anything sexual around me. I remember bringing up my trauma to my therapist and as soon as the conversation started being about sex, I freaked out and stopped talking about it for weeks with my T."
cats,euokcda,t1_eunltw6,1563942864.0,That's the first time I've seen her do that ðŸ˜‚
selfimprovement,eunb6hx,t1_eujwn2m,1563926527.0,Thank you! This is actually really helpful advice! :)
TalkTherapy,eumnjjf,t3_cgl2c7,1563918055.0,"I don't think gender matters. I think a lot of things factor into whether or not they are a good their personalities and age. My first therapist was an older woman and we did not click at all. I saw her for maybe 2 months before deciding that she wasn't a good fit. The one I have now is a younger male and even though it feels a little awkward at times, we get a long pretty well and are always laughing during sessions. He just seems like he listens a lot more than my first therapist did."
TalkTherapy,eumkrp9,t3_cgy30e,1563916991.0,"Mine doesn't really disclose anything to me unless it's helpful to the conversation. Like talking about interests, insecurities, etc. It is kind of weird talking to this stranger where you know nothing about them but it also isn't that weird considering they are there to help me be a better version of myself and they can't really do that if they are constantly sharing personal details about their life."
socialanxiety,eueq6bf,t1_euep6lg,1563750897.0,I think it comes with being insecure and anxious too. I mostly talk about myself to family and friends but it's usually me trying to get reassurance so I can feel better. They always tell me that I'm fine and nothing is wrong but I disagree with them and then ask for more reassurance. It gets really annoying really fast. ðŸ˜­
socialanxiety,eudx5jt,t1_eudww84,1563729758.0,"It's mostly when talking to friends and family. When talking to strangers, I don't really talk about myself at all."
TalkTherapy,eu9ve1x,t3_cf7kjh,1563591928.0,I'm not sure because I felt uncomfortable/awkward at first because I had to talk to someone but I was pretty comfortable talking to my T. I've been seeing them for a few months and started questioning whether it was a good fit but then decided to just talk to them and work out the problem. That session went pretty well and I actually had a lot more to talk about then I thought.
depression,ettqhs7,t3_cd6d58,1563192573.0,Yes! I start to think about all of these cool things I want to do and achieve and then later my mind is telling me that this is all just pointless and I'll never actually be happy.
TalkTherapy,etgsah8,t1_etgr9mt,1562797790.0,The feeling doesn't really last long haha I just started taking meds almost 3 months ago and I'm feeling super emotional again... I hope you find something that works for you though!
TalkTherapy,etgms3i,t3_cb2sm1,1562794446.0,Once I started taking meds things that had been on my mind for YEARS didn't seem as important anymore. I'm just focused on getting better and being happier. I felt the same way you did about taking meds because I went behind my T's back to get medication but I'm glad I did!
ptsd,etgmdv0,t3_cbgh9e,1562794188.0,"No, but I laugh and smile at inappropriate times. My therapist pointed it out to me and said that it's probably to help get rid of the tension of what I'm saying."
TalkTherapy,etesngg,t1_etd2ni9,1562745037.0,"I usually answer with ""I don't know."" I've shared specific feelings a few times but he didn't really validate them?"
TalkTherapy,etbhs50,t3_cauo3t,1562647309.0,I feel the same way... Kind of tired and drained of any emotions. It really sucks
ptsd,et83mhq,t3_ca2cr8,1562545593.0,"Honestly, I feel like I am. As soon as I meet with someone and tell them I had something happen they automatically diagnose me with PTSD.  I spent a couple of weeks looking at the symptoms because I wasn't having any that were noticeable. Which was because I tried not to think about it or the symptoms just became my way to survive and ""move on."""
ptsd,et83fkr,t1_et73kzr,1562545443.0,I did too... I was only 3 or 4 at the time and didn't understand for a while until I realized he did it to multiple people. It always felt personal to me.
TalkTherapy,et0zr0p,t1_estsjdg,1562389570.0,He also told me he read all of the twilight books ðŸ˜‚ but I feel the same way. You are sharing all of your life experiences with someone you know nothing about haha
ptsd,estm7pl,t3_c93wnj,1562269632.0,I don't mind the fireworks. I'm kind of nervous about being around crowds of people though.
ptsd,estlsca,t3_c92mmx,1562269456.0,My uncles get really aggressive when angry and they yell/fight with each other. Every time people get really loud even when laughing or having fun I get scared for a minute because I don't know if they are angry or not. I had a teacher in high school who literally went from 0 to 100 and slammed a yardstick on a table and it broke in half. No one knew why he reacted that way because there was no warning but it really scared me.
TalkTherapy,estdz7o,t3_c93os9,1562265747.0,"Yeah, the only thing I know about mine is that he was born in the same city as me and he travels. I also feel kinda bad for not asking him how he's doing when he asks me how I'm doing."
ptsd,eslmkls,t3_c8bbsb,1562088232.0,I don't have any advice but I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone. I feel the same way during my cycle too. It's such an intimate thing and something I wish I could avoid.
TalkTherapy,esj0g9z,t1_esiz8kv,1562023681.0,"That's a good idea asking about the homework! Honestly, I think having an open conversation about this will be helpful also since I tend to avoid the hard conversations."
TalkTherapy,eshptyn,t1_esgzfug,1561998632.0,"No, when I first started going I was having a lot of anxiety but I am starting to feel a lot better. I was going to take a break and try some of the tools my T gave me and see how I feel."
TalkTherapy,esgll03,t1_esgli6q,1561956855.0,I think I'm going to talk to him about it this week and maybe take a break from therapy.
ptsd,esbetb3,t1_esbeotb,1561788765.0,"I have a therapist I feel comfortable with but this is not something I usually talk about so I feel weird about it. I haven't even talked about the details of it, just how I felt during it and how I feel now."
TalkTherapy,esb8rfr,t1_esb889s,1561781921.0,I honestly feel like my T would burst out laughing if I started singing. I don't mind being quiet but it's the awkward eye contact that bothers me ðŸ˜‚
TalkTherapy,esb83u0,t1_esauuil,1561781273.0,I wish I had your confidence ðŸ˜‚
TalkTherapy,esac92m,t1_esac6bf,1561756365.0,We always talk about how awkward I am and he tells me that he feels awkward too ðŸ˜‚
TalkTherapy,es9uezw,t3_c6estk,1561744753.0,We played games because I was feeling really uncomfortable at first. We would talk about issues while playing connect 4 or cards and it brought some of the tension off me and made me feel more comfortable answering questions.
