Again, this kind of advice is given to executives with the intention of putting the worst possible scenarios in their heads so as to give them a reason as to why they should justify doing what they're doing. But there's no ""correct"" answer in doing this, because it all depends on how you interpret the data, and it can go in either direction. Like I've said, everyone has access to the same data regarding the disease, but it's up to you how you think reaction is best handled, and he has his opinion just like you have yours.

\>Even with ""only"" a 1% death rate, 15-20% of COVID19 sufferers experience severe symptoms requiring hospitalization.

This is the equivalent to, ""unhealthy people who cannot fight off this flu need to be hooked to ventilators to live"". I already know this, the difference is concerning how low this number is and who the sufferers are in this case. If people feel severe symptoms, which the vast majority do not, they can be hooked up to ventilators until they come out in ""recovery"" like, again, the vast majority of victims of the disease. I called you confused for a reason, because you aren't seeing the facts I'm trying to tell you.

\>Did you know the death toll from heart attacks has increased 4-5 fold in NYC? People don't want to go to the hospitals for fear they'll get coronavirus. So when they have chest pains or other symptoms, they just sit at home and hope it's not a heart attack. They wait too long, and they die.

Barely covered by the media, and **not** included in the coronavirus death toll counts.

So you're saying that people who are afraid of a genuine flu strain and end up killing themselves by not going to a hospital should be counted as deaths caused by coronavirus? We only put deaths there that coronavirus itself caused, and even then the majority of victims with the disease which already have underlying health issues probably died of a heart attack or something similar before their flu strain killed them. But again, it isn't the viruses fault these people are dying, it's their paranoia. 

I didn't really say I wanted the economy fully reopened partly because of those reasons, and no, death tolls would be the same as they've always been but only increasing if the virus gets more unhealthy and elderly people.  Trends for this kind of stuff have gone down all throughout March and April, and even the state with more cases than any other nation in the world is reporting a drop.

\>Our only choice is between crushing the economy, and a death toll in the tens of thousands, or crushing the economy, and a death toll in the millions. You opt for the latter. Informed people prefer the former.

This is the only choice for people who like to fear monger, but it doesn't mean these are the only choices the U.S. or any other place faces. Nearly nobody, not even a full tenth of people with the ailment die at all, people cough for 6 days and then they ""recover"". The idea of a death toll in the millions despite the mortality rate and the downward trends is just denial at this point. I prefer neither, fear mongers prefer the ""lock the nation down for 6 months because of a rare low mortality flu equivalent to the plague"".

\>You're only fooling yourself if you think people don't know you pulled your view straight out of Sean Hannity's asshole.

One confused fear monger doesn't mean ""people"", lad, despite how many you want to support your paranoia based fears. It's like how your view were pulled straight out of a conspiracy theorists disabled thoughts, the main difference being everyone else can acknowledge the level of fear mongering you're doing to convince yourself you're right about locking the nation down for multiple months. The truth and Sean Hannity are two very different things, lad, even people like you should be able to see that.

\>You couldn't compare education levels because you didn't know the other poster's education level. Your post **must have** presumed Dr. Phil's PhD gave him special expertise in virology and cost benefit analysis.

**No,** it didn't. Because a random seething redditor who's acting like an overemotional manchild when reacting to someone else's opinion is **presumed by anyone else to have a low if not none existent education level.** You should know already why I assumed he had no education compared to Phil.

\>He made the choice to appear on a demagogue hatemonger's show. That discredits him. That's his choice.

Not really gonna get into your opinion of new's stations you disagree with being ""hatemonger's"", but appearing on Fox is no different than appearing on CNN. Both at times have biases and one is liberal and the other is conservative, but your biases towards everything in this world not aligning with your political views doesn't mean people are bad for appearing on them. That's your choice to believe that appearing on Fox condemns you because you seethe at conservatives, sure, but it doesn't make him wrong. Let's differentiate your personal feelings from people's real opinions they can express anywhere, alright? Like I said to wrap this whole thing up, he has his opinion and you have yours. Try not to be the type to not accept other's ideas because of your personal bias. It isn't a good look."
Coronavirus,fnua1au,t1_fnu10rz,1587257639.0,"Damn, I forgot I made this reply lmao. 

First, technically you're right about how many cases there are worldwide, the difference is you don't know what pushed the entire world to get to this number. And it was the statistics of *one single country,* (mind you still under lockdown). 

Here's the point I was getting at with my argument, when it comes to this disease, cases will fall country after country, as will deaths, until the eventual situation blows over. As what happened with Asia in late March, what happened with the ""hardest hit"" European countries in early April, and what will probably happen with the United States as a whole in May (like with what's happening in NY and OH and such). When it comes down to it, that number is still ridiculously low for our population, over 1/4 have ""recovered"" from it, the vast majority of people probably show mild symptoms until they're in the ""recovery"" category, and less than a tenth of victims end up dying from this disease, (and as I've already told you, it's unlikely to kill anybody at all excluding those who are on the brink of death). This is near the textbook definition of a flu, where it'll be caught, people will recover, and the people with the weakest immunities (however small the number may be compared to the recoveries) will die like how people die during flu season. This is also obviously not to say any single death from the outbreak isn't devastating, because it is, all that's being said is to not blow something out of proportion that'll blow itself out of there.

My main point being, you've seen the trends happening with other countries once described as epicenters and you've seen the minimal effect it's had on countries that didn't decide to react the way most have (Sweden and Brazil). A lot of places are already reopening themselves partially because they are aware of when this thing is beginning to pass. So to get my revised point across, this'll end the same way other diseases end. It just doesn't mean you need to overreact and panic. And besides, it's been nearing half a year since this outbreak started, and 160k have died in that entire time with OP's post saying it'll get to 1.8m as if trends aren't decreasing. See my point in how sometimes people want to see the worst case scenarios in everything they read? And before I forget, you were right about how many cases would be worldwide so congratulations, I admit that.

Every model shows that we were headed for millions of deaths in this country alone had these lockdowns not been implemented. The lockdowns are working and are the only reason we see some light at the end of the tunnel.

Here's the thing, the existing ""curve"" was never in existence based on it's numbers, the virus still afflicts a low number of people and cases have continued to increase for weeks since mid March. And in that whole time, lockdown measures have been implemented nearly everywhere, and yet only for some countries has the rate of new cases gone down.

The idea that an ""adult"" thinks that ""millions"" of deaths will happen from a 2% mortality flu that barely afflicts that number of people in a population of 7 billion is cringey and enough, but I'm not surprised. Models, (mind you that barely any said what you just described), that predict the worst case scenarios won't always happen because you want to lock yourself in your closet and convince yourself that the worst case scenario will happen. There was already light at the end of the tunnel, because there was no tunnel. To disabled children who want to overreact, sure. To any functioning human being? A low mortality flu afflicting half a percent of people doesn't instigate a ""tunnel"". And still, 2k deaths, (mind you that most come from states under the most severe quarantine) is still ridiculously low, and cases will most likely continue to decrease as they've done for dozens of nations all throughout the world. My point is that his opinion is his opinion, your childish opinions in overreacting to a flu aren't correct because you want to convince yourself that this is a threat worthy of the attention it's received. You can be the type to lock yourself in your house and wear riot gear wherever you go, sure, but not everyone has to behave the way you do. Some people are adults, lad.

Like I've already tried to tell you a dozen times, there is a difference between a factually incorrect statement and an opinion that actually has basis. I get you're challenged in not understanding the difference, but you not understanding it doesn't put this on the level of flat Earth. It's like your opinion being we should hide in doomsday bunkers because of flu season. I'll be sympathetic to you because you truly sound like a sheltered and misguided manchild who doesn't understand what he's talking about, but lad, your childish fears of a flu doesn't mean everyone has to react the same way. You can be in your closet, alone, but not everyone is going to join your challenged self in putting their lives on hold. Some people have lives and are capable of maturing, understand?

Lad, I called you a misguided child for a reason, and I get you may have a disability or something but you can't project things about you onto me because you can't handle hearing the truth. You're underdeveloped emotionally but still, seething over the truth because you are too childish to admit you were wrong doesn't make anyone, including him, wrong about anything they said. The types of childish fears that I hear from people like you are the same as people who thought the world was going to end in 2012. I can't support any of those two things because I support facts and open minded opinions, but I can't say the same thing about sheltered people like you. And listen, you can be overdramatic and act dyslexic in espousing complete nonsense in thinking no one else can have their own opinion, it's fine with me, but you not being able to handle the truth you hear won't ever make them incorrect. There's no other way I can explain this to your kind, please just look back on your behavior and ask yourself if you were ever being melodramatic. Or, just lock yourself in your closet and let people get on with their lives. Maybe stop acting like a conspiracy theorist for once in your life, and mature past the age of 15. You understand?"

Here's where you're critically confused, the decision of others simply because they are in executive positions does not make them in any way correct. See, countries like Canada and the U.S. want to completely shut themselves down and destroy their economies out of fear. Remember, the difference here is that the fear can be justified, or it cannot be justified. Regardless, it's all about an opinion, no one person is correct just because you have a bias towards what you feel should be the reaction.

I don't know how confused you are, but buddy, throwing out random conspiracies to try to defend why you're right doesn't mean you're right. Someone needs to tell you this, but your opinion isn't correct just because you have it. You can tell yourself whatever you want to hear to make yourself feel justified in overreacting to a flu, but it still won't make your opinion correct. It'll give me a good laugh if you still think so but you should understand my point by now.

Also, I didn't say he had any ""special expertise"" in discussing the best action to take in response to this flu, all I was saying to the other person is that he is more qualified to speak than he is simply because of his education level. In reality, and it is no simpler than this, he can have his opinion that the country shouldn't be closed for multiple months for this, and you can have your opinion in thinking that it should be. That opinion doesn't make him a bad person in any way, and it isn't harmful because you don't want to accept something you can't stand hearing. Point is, he has his opinion, and you have yours. He isn't any more of a bad person than you are."
AskReddit,fnrccbv,t1_fnpwiis,1587184819.0,"Figured, I think he made a video doing what liberals do in literally comparing all conservatives and right wingers to people who don't support rights for others.

Haven't seen his channel in a while and probably never will but it's a cringey disappointment."
drphil,fnptgw6,t1_fnpq2f0,1587151696.0,"\>You're pretty much incorrect in actually everything you say! Congrats!

You can act disabled in not respecting others opinions, that's fine, but that doesn't mean they're incorrect. Not much else to tell you besides that.

\>When it comes to matters of ""health"", health experts are obviously the ones to listen to. How moronic are you? His opinion is flat-out wrong and nothing but harmful.

With opinions like this, you act as if you're a sheltered child who relies on others personal opinions because you're too easily misguided to form your own. They can be experts in the medical field, but they can't always make choices based on facts, statistics differ for this reason. For instance, the whole world shouldn't be on lockdown for a 2% mortality flu that afflicts under half a percent of people everywhere. His opinion. Doctors (not all) think, out of overprotection, that the country should be closed for that reason. There is no fact based choice to make here, it's all up to you based on how you interpret the statistics in front of you. You choose to act like a misguided child in believing everyone you hear because you aren't mentally strong enough to form your own opinion. You can choose that, but it doesn't mean everyone else has to behave the same way. His opinion is his opinion, he can have it if he'd like, and you seething over it won't make it incorrect.

\>Now back to the Trumper rallies for you!

Yikes, is this what you resort to when you lose an argument?"
drphil,fnpkcbp,t1_fnpecvt,1587147014.0,"\>His ""personal opinion"" is as valid as somebody who comes on his show and gives their opinion that the earth is flat.

There's your difference, the idea that the Earth is flat is actually incorrect, his opinion can be correct depending on how you prefer to react to this. And buddy, take it like this, health professionals recommending you stay a shut in until the end of the summer because of a fear of catching this flu is part of what's being ""overprotective"". It's like going to a physician and an abnormal lump or something on you is found, it'll immediately be presumed to be the worst possible thing and multiple steps will be taken in case it is that thing. A health professionals opinion isn't always factually correct, you cannot immediately base your feelings on this disease based solely on their opinions of how it is dealt with. The only ignorance in what he said is how he formatted his thoughts, like ""hundreds of thousands die of this so why isn't the country locked down for those things?"". His point was that he probably thinks the whole lockdown for multiple months is a melodramatic response to this disease because it isn't in any way severe in deaths or mortality rates and such. Again, you can feel that the country should be locked down, but he can also feel that that type of a response is overdramatic and unnecessary. 

Also, the stats he listed were correct if you're referring to the automobile and smoking ones, he just got the swimming pool deaths wrong."
drphil,fnp3zxa,t1_fnooki3,1587138814.0,"It's his personal opinion, just like how it's your personal opinion to overreact this hard to the disease. But the fact that he has a PhD makes him more qualified to speak on it than you do. It's as simple as that, it's just your opinion and it's just his opinion."
drphil,fnp3ieg,t3_g2tnp6,1587138574.0,He formatted this completely wrong but the point was that the country was being overdramatic.
