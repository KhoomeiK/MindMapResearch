ImmigrationCanada,fr2f4ws,t1_fr2eud4,1589836200.0,Oh okay thanks. I’m assuming they don’t issue study permits at the border if you’ve renewed them as opposed to when it’s your first time.
ImmigrationCanada,fr2chvr,t1_fr2auar,1589834922.0,"Oh, okay. That makes sense. I think I will just renew my CAQ and Study Permit here in Canada and then go back to my home country and deal with the TRV there.

Also, you said you got your TRV and Study Permit at the border. Was this a renewal or was it the first time you got your TRV and Study Permit? I'm assuming first time."
ImmigrationCanada,fr29hwv,t1_fr27zid,1589833458.0,"Thank you, my friend, for responding. I am not sure but I did read somewhere that implied status doesn't work outside Canada. But my question is, if I apply for Study Permit renewal outside Canada, and if the process of renewal continues beyond the expiry of my Study Permit, that means I lose my implied status until a decision is made on my renewal. But I only need a Study Permit to study \*inside\* Canada. So does that mean I can continue my online studies in my home country after losing my implied status, wait until a decision is made on my Study Permit, and come back to Canada to resume studies on my renewed Study Permit (of course, after I also then renew my TRV)?

Btw I'm pretty sure I can renew my TRV outside Canada (If I'm not mistaken)

Concordia,fqn1ua2,t3_gjq8d8,1589487252.0,"Thank you so much for making this post.

I've been anxious and stressed for most of the time since late March. I just found out that most courses are online in Fall so I decided to go back to my home country so I can be with my family and study there. But I am also faced with renewing my study documents such as CAQ, Study Permit, and the Study Visa, all of which are expiring at the same time in the next three months. These documents will take me a lot of time to renew and will most likely force me to stay in the country. I want to spend as much time as possible with my family before I return to Canada in (hopefully) January and resume in-person classes. But the prospect of being stuck here renewing documents is honestly stressing me out. It's making me think I won't be spending as much of a time with my family as I'd like. I hope it's not the case, and I spend at least most of the Fall semester with my family. 

Oh and I wish nothing but the best for you guys. We're all gonna get through this. You all are stronger than you think. Take care of yourselves and stay safe.

Those are valueless people who can’t add anything to anyone’s life including their own, so they turn to blind hatred and make you the target of their self-hatred. They are, quite simply, not right.

What you should focus on is how brave you are for coming out as a trans person and being public with it. You are stronger than you think. Forging your own public and personal identity despite a lot of hate from other people is outright badass.

Despite what anyone says, your sex or gender identity has no bearing on whether you’re a real human with complex emotions, goals and personality traits. You’re a real human with a real personality and you have value. You have the complete right to change your body to better fit your mental image of yourself if it makes your life much better.

[(Quiz 1 out of 3)+(Quiz 2 out of 7.5)+(Midterm out of 27)]*2.46 + 7.75

As for question, I don’t think there’s any grade redistribution max grade limit. It would be unfair to have such a limit, considering that the whole reason the grade redistribution exists it provide a fair way for students who can’t write the exam to still do well in the course.

As for your question, I think she will generally accept our request for grade redistribution if we don’t write the final exam. I am not too sure but in all her emails, she keeps reiterating that she will automatically “consider” us for grade redistribution if we don’t write the final. I think that probably means she will give us the grade redistribution no questions asked.

Secondly, thank you very much for your suggestion. I have been definitely thinking of psychedelics because the way people talk about them, it's got me curious. And I wanna see if my life can turn out better with psychedelics in it. I don't know how easily accessible they are in Canada, but I do have friends who are experts on this so I guess I'm covered. 

I'm curious, if you don't me asking, have you had any previous experiences with psychedelics? If so, would you mind talking about them?


Also, I just wanna say that you actually trying to suggest something to improve my condition, despite the fact that not two minutes ago we were arguing, tells me that I was deeply wrong about your capacity to empathize. I mean, I know it wasn't a straight up cat and dog kind of arguing but it was confrontational for sure. Bur despite that, you were able to reach out to the ""other side"" with an offer of help. Few people do that, man. No matter how people react to you, I hope you never stop believing that you're a force of good."
Concordia,fn7ln44,t1_fn7f8r5,1586722795.0,"Oh man. I'm so glad I decided to continue talking to you because it turns out I was actually able to see the human being in you. What you said about yourself, I can actually relate with that. You're right to say that there are causes everyone is passionate about and thus everyone has a trigger. I do, you do, we all do. In the end, no matter how much we improve ourselves, we're still humans. I learned a lot in this conversation and I hope you go to bed realizing you made a tiny positive impact today. Thank you very much.

I also wanna say that I am sorry for making it seem like I was rejecting your human self. I'm very sorry to have that negative effect on you and luckily this is one of the things I learned today. Going forward, I will try my best to talk to people without neglecting their emotional needs. You have the complete and valid right to react to things and your reactions are genuine. I'm just disappointed I didn't see this sooner myself.

That said, I wanna address some of the points you made in no particular order.

1) According to you, there were a lot of students who were flinging insults at the faculty. 

And you are right. Over the past few weeks I've seen some morally questionable comments aimed at the faculty. Do I condone such comments? Nope. I'm with you there. But I am willing to make the bet that most students who are mad at the faculty are also in the same boat when it comes to this. Most of them wouldn't condone such words. 

And here's the thing. All these students who are flinging dehumanizing insults at the faculty are doing so because just like you right now, they have triggers, and they are going through mental hardships right now due to the pandemic. Many students are worried about their health, their jobs, their families and everything. And on top of that, Concordia and some professors are admittedly making it harder. So it is natural to see a lot of students react so angrily and violently to Concordia's stupid policies. Would most of these people do any regretful action against the faculty due to their mental duress? I don't think so. Do I still agree with all these guys who are flinging insults? Nope, but I do understand why they do that. Because again, they're real human beings with real lives and real needs. Of course, understanding =/= endorsement. 

I guess this is what I meant by having empathy. Every one on both teams is suffering massively. This pandemic has demanded a lot out of us. So just walking through this with empathy towards both sides will make this go much easier. I like to think of myself as a calm, stoic person with a sensitivity towards people's needs, but I would be lying if said I didn't have moments where I was irrationally angry at someone and said something to them that I later regretted. As you said, we're all human, we all have our best and worst moments but overall we all want only good to happen in the world. In moments of weakness, we might show our bad side, but any remotely good person will never condone or accept such acts openly and proudly. In the end, I think what matters is we fix our mistakes and try to do better than yesterday. You have done that here, I must say, and I applaud you for accepting your mistakes with humbleness and pointing out mine.  

You are also right to say that our behavior has an impact and so I stand with you when you say that we should end our irrational hatred against the faculty, and actually be more grateful to them. 


2) According to you, there are students who are perhaps knowingly or unknowingly riding on the backs of this movement to get a free ride out of having to do exams genuinely. 

And I agree with this too. But I also think that actually genuine and passionate students who've been voicing their valid concerns against the proctored exam vastly outnumber these freeloaders. And so I think we shouldn't pay attention to these guys. They're harming only themselves. One day they're gonna have to make up for all the lack of knowledge. My point being, we shouldn't risk mistaking actually genuine students with these freeloaders.

And I completely understand you reacting so passionately to the guy who started the thread. You have your completely valid beliefs. But I would advise against reacting so passionately to what appears to be such a random stupid harmless comment. Why? Because it is a waste of your time. It's like you're angry at the 0.01% of the bacteria that doesn't get washed away when you use soap. Yes bacteria is harmful and it is important to be vigilant against something harmful but right now its amount is so little that it doesn't have any real chance of having a negative impact on anything. On principle, it makes sense to achieve a 0% bacteria presence but pragmatically speaking, the 0.01% isn't gonna do shit. Hence I disagree with your ""A few spoiled apples spoil the bunch"" because in this specific case, their presence doesn't do shit to anything. But I suppose it is noble to want to remain strict in principle against something harmful and wanting to maintain authenticity and security. The bacteria example may be not scientifically accurate lmao but I hope it at least illustrates my argument. 

Once again, thank you for your time. You made a lot of good points and corrected many of my errors. I am grateful for that. I'll keep what you said in mind. 
And I also hope that you get what you want out of this life, and that your critical voice doesn't die down. I also hope you can make peace with the fact that no matter what, there will always be pollution out there, and so it is our job to decide what to spend time complaining about and who we can safely ignore. 

Take care my friend, and stay safe."
Concordia,fn75veq,t1_fn74do8,1586713888.0,"You’re right, I shouldn’t expect 100% perfection from humans. In an ideal world we can debate perfectly but we’re humans after all. With that said, I still think you failed to answer his genuine question. You could have answered his question properly and within reason but you chose to go the route of being sarcastic and glib, thus you kicked your own argument in the nuts. It is not unrealistic to expect humans to answer a simple question properly. You could have shown people what you meant and could have proved your point but you chose the easy emotional route of being sarcastic and glib. Waste of an opportunity imo. I think that’s why you got downvoted. 

All of this to say you were unnecessarily dismissive of a simple question. It’s not enough to to be simply right. You also have to be empathetic. You were probably right about him being a hypocrite, but you didn’t have to treat the other guy that way and accuse him of being privileged when all he did was ask a simple question. Again, you erupted at a guy for asking a simple question. No matter what point you’re arguing, that’s not a civil way to behave.

And with that said, even if the guy you responded to turns out to be a hypocrite, what is he doing that will harm the students now? Is the dean going to see his comment and post history and suddenly reinstate COLE? Is the media going to portray Concordia students as some kind of cheap freeloaders? It’s weird that you would blow up at such a harmless (but admittedly stupid) comment.

My argument is not “ND should come clean because it would be a great PR strategy”

My argument is “ND should come clean and vow to do better because it would be the right thing to do, regardless of what it would cost them”

Games,fjneuiw,t1_fjm75fc,1583505782.0,"There have been studies to debunk the “piracy causes sales loss” claims. Really, google it. Yes, a good chunk of people pirate games but it’s not too bad. Again, this is a myth that has been debunked time and time again. Games on PC continue to sell great. Again, all of this is a simple google search away.

Also, Xbox sounds to me like they’re adapting. They realize that there is a huge portion of their market who don’t care about the consoles and just want access to the games so MS is catering to them. That is a good move. They’re making their products more accessible. Now more people will be able to play their games and the brand as you keep mentioning grows too. 

Also you keep talking about “brand” but you’re missing the forest for the trees, dude. The brand comes from not the console, but the actual games. Just think about it. When you think of PlayStation, the console itself barely comes to mind. It’s the amazing line up of exclusives you’re thinking about. That’s what makes the brand. My love for Sony and the PlayStation brand will not suddenly drop in value because they’re putting their games on PC. I will continue to have access to their amazing line up of exclusives on either PS4 or PC. 

If, in a very very rare case, Sony decides to stop making consoles and just make games for all platforms, then they’ll become like Ubisoft but with actually great games. I do think it will be rare for PlayStation to forego consoles entirely, but Sony is smart and they’re catering to as many people as possible.

I’m merely echoing Industry people."
Games,fjm5nq2,t1_fjm39cn,1583462184.0,"Okay so I understand what you're saying. Here's what I think you're mistaking.

The Playstation brand has nothing to do with the actual hardware of the consoles. It is merely a catalyst. Their actual brand and reputation comes from the quality of their games. When you reminisce about the PS2, you're not thinking about how cool the memory card was, how awesome the console looked. No, you think about what kind of games you could play on that console, and the particular games you played at the time. Of course, the hardware influences your perception too, but it is not the central thing. 

If Sony adopts the strategy of releasing on PS first and PC 8 months later, then they lose nothing, but gain a huge portion of players for their fanbase. Like I said, people who game on consoles are not going to change their platform. I think I am making a solid assumption by saying that most PS4 owners either don't have a PC, or don't know how to build one. So they literally don't give a shit if a game comes on PC. If they see a cool game, they'll buy it on their PS4. Whereas PC Players who don't give a shit about consoles but have been interested in the exclusives can buy them now. My central argument is that allowing their games to come to PC will not affect the current ecosystem in any way. All it will do it attach another subsection of gamers to it. A new audience. Who only cares about the exclusive games. 

Also, the ""piracy causes loss of sales"" is a debunked myth. At the risk of ending up on r/GamingCircleJerk, The Witcher 3 is an example of a game that continues to sell well to this day. Mostly on PC. Not to mention the many probably PC Exclusive games that go on to sell like pancakes on a hot day. I can't come up with an example though. 

One last thing: We already know that Horizon is coming to PC. Sony, being a business leader in their industry, would never make a huge decision like that without fully understanding the ramifications of that decision. But outwardly, their strategy makes sense to me. Let the fans buy the games on PS4, then let the other fans buy them on PC 8 months. Only a very few percentage (1%) of people will opt to wait and buy on PC. And even then Sony isn't losing the money."
Games,fjm1oc0,t1_fjm13am,1583459542.0,"First of all, as a gamer who cares about playing games, why do you care so much about a billion dollar company's revenue stream? As a gamer I only care about what game I play and where I can play it. And I am super glad some of my favorite games can be played by other people who could not play it because of the price barrier of buying a console. 

And even if I do entertain your central point, putting their exclusives on other platforms does not do jack shit to their business. People who play on one (or two) platform(s) primarily will not suddenly move to other platforms. Playstation gamers will buy the exclusives day one, then the PC players will get it for themselves at a later date. I will continue to buy the exclusives on PS4, despite having a bomb PC. Because that's what I'm used to. I even buy the multiplats on PS4. Basically the ecosystem is not affected much. All Sony is doing is bringing in more people to play their games, which actually means more revenue. And you have to understand, consoles are not the only source of revenue for Sony. Sony makes most of its money through PS Plus and the exclusives. Allowing PC players to play their games is literally just increasing the fanbase, which equals more money.

Could be wrong though.

Games,fg05esl,t1_ffzx5vv,1580400601.0,"Bro you didn’t read my comment. You didn’t address any of my points. And I don’t think you’ve been polite at all. When I asked for more reasons you said “say please” in a dismissive and rude tone like wow what a way to have conversation with someone. But that’s fine. I can deal with that. What I can’t deal with is you not wanting to consider the opposing POV. I started the discussion to learn (and learn I did, even from you). No discussion happens with the tone you’re taking. You’ve basically accepted your POV as the default one and that no one 
can show you that you’re wrong.

You’re not losing any choice to buy games. It takes 40 seconds to download the Epic launcher and buy the game. Unlike PS4 where you have to buy it for 400 dollars and then pay for their games. There’s no lack of choice here. People have been buying games on Epic left and right, me included. Borderlands 3 and Control have been one of their best selling. This goes to show people don’t care what launcher they’re playing on as long they’re getting the game they want to play. All these millions of people don’t feel like they’re being robbed of a choice, because they’re not.

Edit: and you’ve been saying the same argument over and over again like you don’t have any other point. That argument is not that strong honestly. It’s a fake ghost you’ve put up yourself to scare yourself."
Games,ffza2bz,t1_ffz7lz6,1580369090.0,"I am disappointed. I was hoping to engage in meaningful discourse and all I got was your condescending spiel. If you don’t have any other reason against Epic, then it would be nice if you just flat out said that. I think it’s disingenuous to say “there are other reasons too” without listing them. It means you get to make your point without proving it. It’s lazy and unproductive.

And how does Exclusivity hurt consumers? It forces companies to compete to make a more attractive product for the consumer cause they’re all fighting for the consumers validation. It’s not that hard to understand. 

Sony is the best in the business for fantastic story-driven action-adventure games so they get my business all the time. I have no problem paying for a PS4 so I can play their games. It costs less then a PC at the same performance and it is also way less annoying without having to worry about looking for PC parts, learning how to assemble them, assembling them, worrying about how the game will run on PC, and so much. There’s no denying PC is stronger and I do have a strong PC but you can’t deny the simplicity of consoles. 

Epic is forcing Valve to have better policies for game devs and consumers. As it stands, Epic gives more share to developers than steam does. And going forward, they are going to force Valve to re-evaluate how they run business. There’s nothing stopping Valve from saying “Hey I guess we’ll just increase our share to 40% from 30%, fuck the game developers”. That’s scary. No company should have that power. 

But with Epic that has the potential to change."
Games,ffz7eb0,t1_ffz6ukz,1580366297.0,"List those other reasons.

And exclusivity is one of the main tools businesses have of competing. Otherwise there will be a monopoly by one company and creativity and progress stagnates. I don’t see you complaining when you can only buy a Big Mac at McDonalds. I don’t see you complaining when Sony makes exclusives to sell their consoles. But Epic for some reason is the bad guy. They’re the nazis.

Yes it would be nice to live in a Utopia where all things are available everywhere but unfortunately for us this is not that world. And it’s time Steam lost its monopoly anyways. Especially when Epic games are supporting game devs and making it easier for game devs to make and release games. This competition is healthy and will force each other to compete and thus create better products. The same way MS and Sony do. The competition is important.

Edit: and what the hell is an artificial exclusive? What’s artificial about it? It’s just an exclusive. Just like all other exclusives in all industries. And what Epic is doing is the polar opposite of anti competitive."
Games,ffz4zrm,t1_ffz4vhi,1580364174.0,"Okay, you’re right. List me some genuine reasons to dislike Epic. And I mean genuine dislike and not just that you prefer Steam over Epic."
Games,ffz3i4l,t1_ffz252r,1580362741.0,"The fact that people automatically default to trashing on every Epic game without any reason is sad, don’t you think?"
Games,ffyfs12,t1_ffy8ngi,1580345373.0,"Didn’t know about the minimum sales thing.

But how are devs trading good will? Are you implying going Epic exclusive is trading good will?"
Games,ffy5s6p,t1_ffy41wf,1580339094.0,Hmm that’s a compelling argument. Okay I concede my original point. I forgot to realize that there’s a difference between being an Anti Epic Activist and a person with a preference. I’m just disappointed I didn’t see it sooner but nonetheless glad that I see it now.
Games,ffy1shw,t1_ffy1lln,1580336880.0,That’s a fair argument.
Games,ffy1a3d,t1_ffy1435,1580336574.0,Think of the developers who will benefit from getting your support early.
Games,ffxspif,t1_ffxm93u,1580331659.0,"The features or their lack thereof don’t affect the quality of the game. Controller support exists and cloud saves also exist for certain games on Epic anyways. All the basic customization and features exist on Epic save for a few teensy ones, which are gonna be added soon anyways. It will take much less time for those features to end up on Steam than for steam to finally have the game on itself. Plus e developers gets your support early."
Games,ffxrugj,t1_ffxq9nh,1580331179.0,"That sucks, brother/sister and I’m glad you have cloud saves on Steam. But that’s too rare an issue. A true issue, but a rare one. You shouldn’t worry about not having it when playing a game."
Games,ffxk7xb,t1_ffxjl8m,1580326819.0,"Those features are super niche though, and are not necessary to enjoy those games to the max. And I’ve been using Epic to play their free games all the time, it works like a charm for me, so not sure what you have against Epic’s stability. 

Also Steam reviews are cool, but a good portion of them are filled with either joke reviews with inaccurate ratings or just straight up trolls and idiots. If you wanna watch a review just go to YouTube and follow any awesome Game Reviewers.

And how does a game become inferior by being on Epic? It’s the same damn game."
Games,ffxjq57,t1_ffxj5cl,1580326530.0,"Actually wait. I’ve been stupid. I’ve been failing to see your point this whole time. I’m sorry!

I guess it makes sense to me what you’re saying. Your last sentence made me realize my mistake. The ecosystem thing. It makes sense to not want to use another platform for your games, especially if you play online games. 

Sorry for not seeing this earlier! I’ve been treating you like those Anti Epic Activists who think Epic is some sort of “industrial terrorism”, but you’re not! Just a guy with a preference."
Games,ffxiyol,t1_ffxhzmc,1580326084.0,"Epic has cloud save support for only select games AFAIK. Controller support also exists for games but I don’t think anything other than an Xbox controller works. But I understand not liking the absence of cloud saves or controller support. I get that. But these features are going to be added sooner than the game will be released on Steam. Plus as I said, you can already play most games with controllers. Just not the controller of your choice, and even then there are software workarounds. Same for cloud saves. 

Another disadvantage of waiting is that the developers don’t get support early on, especially indie devs. 

My entire point is: it’s weird to wait on a game you wanna buy because it’s available on a platform that doesn’t have niche features that you don’t even need to fully enjoy the game.

Edit: Forgot to mention. Cloud Saves are not an immediate necessity. You don’t need to worry about your saves magically getting corrupted. Plus most people play on a single device so they won’t be worry about saves carrying over most of the time."
Games,ffxhjtf,t1_ffxh0w1,1580325283.0,"But that’s weird, my man. So the only reason you’re not playing it on Epic and supporting the devs early is because you wanna keep all your games in one place and be able to save 10 seconds and launch it from Steam. That’s a first world problem if I ever heard one, dawg. I think the developers would really appreciate it if they got your support early on, especially if they’re barely keeping the lights on. I get that this is entertainment and that people are entitled to their preference. I don’t care what your preferences are, but I can say it’s fucking weird as hell. It also is harmful to indie developers in some cases."
Games,ffxgqxd,t1_ffxbbgo,1580324818.0,"Epic is making so many features right now as we speak. It’s fine to say you want more features but it’s just outright lying if you say they’re not trying to make a better product. Plus, most important features are already in place. The only features they don’t have right now are luxury features that Steam has and that’s because Steam has been around for way longer. You can literally buy and play your games right now on Epic and it all works. Plus they’re giving away so many free games and so many developers are able to have their games find a bigger audience from that. I get your preference for Steam but saying Epic is not doing good things is just not smart and so biased, for what reason?"
Games,ffxg2vi,t1_ffxfjxx,1580324434.0,"Which is, what, like 1000 people? Out of I dunno, at least a million gamers. It’s weird to not buy a game on a platform which doesn’t have a feature that is catered to a very small group of people. Like, fine. You can’t play a game remotely. That sucks. But you can just play it on your PC. Normal. Do you play every game remotely?"
Games,ffxft8g,t1_ffx7wwq,1580324281.0,"It’s weird though. If you wanna play a game, and it doesn’t make that much of a difference what launcher you use to play it, then wouldn’t it make sense to just get it where it’s available? The developers also get support early. I’ve played plenty of games on Steam and Epic and they’re at least functional. You can enjoy any game you want on them, it’s just Epic doesn’t have luxury features."
Games,ffxfikw,t1_ffxdltv,1580324105.0,"Hey good for you, man!"

Soldier:  I’m sorry sir. We don’t wanna take any chances.

Me: okay listen to me

Soldier: sure

Me: sometimes, life is not about playing it safe. Although being safe is cool, most of life happens outside our comfort zone.

Games,fdi4znj,t3_elhtka,1578435828.0,"Man, what a fucking game.

My mom got this for me when I told her I was thinking of buying this. Christmas was around, she knew what she had to. She was always a classy yet adorable cutie.

A lot of people give indies flak for either being too unique or being too shitty, but by god shoot me if they aren’t the last bastion of creativity in the industry. 

The way this game got to me is beyond me. I don’t know *how*, but it just works. The shooting is ooomphy, the visual are awesome and the ost wraps this all up wonderfully. This is not even mentioning all tiny gameplay design nuances.

Somehow I even got my mom to give it a try, and we always tried to squeeze this game in between our sessions. She will always say “okay honey dads gonna be home soon we gotta finish” and after handing her the towel, we would make our way to the living room where our Switch was. The next two hours were spent on us trying to up each other’s score and clearing areas. Sometimes she wouldn’t even clean up properly before booting up the game. She even got in trouble for it lol

It’s been two years now and after her divorce, I still go to her apartment with my Switch and we have a quality time with the game. The game still hold up and will NEVER get old. Sometimes I would play alone though and Dad will be asking my Mom why she can’t tell him who he was. Who’s He? What did he do? Who cares!? I am ending virtual lives, baby!!

Cannot wait for the new game to come out."

Games,fc9qdpz,t1_fc9q5v2,1577556616.0,Steven Ogg is Canadian so according to the International Canadian’s Law he cannot be put in the Rockstar Vault (section 420 of the ICL).
Games,fc9oviw,t3_egteri,1577555936.0,"Rockstar Vault. If Rockstar likes someone enough they get stored, and only they have access to the talent. They don’t want talent to “leak” and thus protect them like American senators protect their child porn.

There is also the old Rockstar philosophy of “not doing anything others are doing”. They take this commitment one step further and make sure that all the talent they hire isn’t part of anything outside their portfolio. Even if you’ve so much as appeared in a YouTube ad, kiss your Rockstar career bye-bye.

If you’re interested in working with their actors, you have to be associated with Rockstar in some way so as to “protect” the brand and talent pool. 

For example, last year I was fortunate enough to work with CJ’s voice actor on a commercial. As is customary, I had to send a letter to Rockstar to get their approval to work with him and then CJ had to sign it. When I handed him the letter to sign he said “Ahh shit here we go again”.

So yeah."

Concordia,fat9mzp,t1_fat5l1h,1576336050.0,"Great point! I am right there with you. My issue is that this course is more than just the basics. It’s basically beginning to teach me how to manipulate circuits to get the output I want. It’s heavily technical and goes into detail. There are heavily technical labs. And there’s heavily complicated Science. And I would be happy with this course if I was in Electrical. But it felt like I momentarily began an Electrical degree when I did this course. I’m sure this is a great setup to Electrical Engineering and I have the utmost respect for the field, but this course is tangential to software. 

I already did learn the basics of Circuits in PHYS 205 plus a good amount of software courses also teach you some hardware stuff. 

And I like that analogy. I wanna be a race car driver, but I feel like they wasted too much of my time and money teaching me not only how a combustion engine works, but also how to make them. I could’ve spent that time honing my skills as a driver. Learning tangential but useful-to-your-field knowledge (as a principle) is great, but when it goes against pragmatism, it works against its intentions. 

And dude thanks for responding ! Food for thought in there."

Concordia,fasrplv,t1_fasr6g3,1576330594.0,"Another good point! Unfortunately it was nothing cool like arduinos or pi. The whole course was just analyzing circuits and finding out resistances, currents and voltages. There were also magnetic circuits, transformers and DC motors.

And yes there were labs but the labs were mostly just not well designed (were too complicated for first time students) plus they were all very simple stuff based on the stuff I just mentioned.
