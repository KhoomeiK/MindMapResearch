If you'll talk to them, maybe tell them how much that hurts you. Assholes. On the other hand... Do they know you are depressed? Maybe they just want to respect your privacy, you never know.

I really recommend finding a professional help, they can't bail on you like 'friends'. (for me personally CBT is the best)"

I'm in the same boat, somewhat. Look into neuroplasticity, it really gave me hope and purpose. Everything is in your brain. I wouldn't change the meds unless the doctor advises so, if you don't have any side effects. Focus on routine. Do something every day, no matter what. It can be as simple as making your bed in the morning to get you started or shower every day.
