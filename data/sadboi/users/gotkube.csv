cymbalta,fffkw8r,t3_etd820,1579886171.0,"Yup. I even told my psydoc that I was worried about side effects because I have bad health anxiety. He said ‘don’t worry, stick with it until it subsided and the medication will take care of the health anxiety’: so I waited for things to settle down, but they didn’t. That was over 3yrs ago and now I’m stuck on a medication that has only made my anxiety worse, came with a bunch of health anxiety-triggering side effects and awful withdrawal symptoms that make the anxiety even worse! Get off this poison ASAP"

AskReddit,f9t9b9l,t3_e6oh3e,1575613414.0,Fully support it. Everyday I see entitled pricks blatantly disobey traffic laws because they know the penalty is a drop in the bucket for them (assumed based on the value of the vehicles they drive).

unpopularopinion,f8wj7iq,t3_e2gfsv,1574892027.0,"Yup. This is pretty accurate based on my own experiences. Men’s “emotions” (even just stating facts about how a situation affects ones stress levels) are minimized. Mine have been; by even my closest friends and family. I’m easily forgotten because I’m “difficult” or some shit.
Being seen as less of a man is just collateral damage. The real damage is lack of empathy."

cymbalta,ewhig3o,t3_chukct,1565409093.0,"I’ve been on Cymbalta almost 3 years. Last December I tried CBD oil, and Infelt great for a while, but then I started feeling worse; REALLY tired.
Came across info (can’t remember where) that suggested CBD oil inhibits the metabolization of Cymbalta in the liver; it essentially blocks Cymbalta from being processed, which leaves it circulating in the blood longer and, presumably, causes side effects to hang around longer. 
I stopped taking it and I quickly rebounded. I dunno, your mileage may vary"
