In Piedmontese cooking where it originates, medium grain rice is typical,  but I've worked in restaurants that user bulgar, farro or barley.  The trick is to thinly veil it in *hot* liquid to break down the starches to make it creamy. 


You can even shortcut for a dinner party by par- cooking it to just under al dente  and letting it sit, then do the final adding of liquid when you need to finish it (the final part still takes like 10 minutes)."

I don't think Mainers really benefit from this deal, though I do support green energy.
