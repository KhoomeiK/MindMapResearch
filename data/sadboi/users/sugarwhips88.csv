I couldn’t get out of bed and one incision (the one where my belly pulled the most) was awful. I am also a baby when it comes to Pain. 

I am taking 2 weeks off from work and will have an additional 2 weeks worth of help after from my mom. I run my own in-home daycare. I’ve been worried about the lifting restrictions. I have babies and toddlers I will have to lift. Do you have weight restrictions? I know o will get the info from my surgeon in a few weeks. But I just wanted an idea."

I have sleep apnea. (17 episodes an hour) Been using a CPAP for almost a year. I don’t have any significant health issues.

I had to do 6 months of weight management visits, psych eval, labs. I had already completed the other required testing due to my sleep apnea. My PCP had to write a letter stating I am low cardiac risk.

Nanny,fp005ha,t3_gaix5h,1588200009.0,"I feel a babysitter is just there to watch the kids then leave. I think maybe a nanny has more responsibility. From what I’ve seen many nannies make the meals, clean and do the laundry. Some are even going grocery shopping as well. I think it depends on what the person is willing to do. To me if you are cooking,cleaning, and shopping too it is like a personal assistant type role as well."

I also have a chronic pain/inflammatory issue which ofc it helps. On bad pain days I up the dose. It’s amazing how good CBD is.

Nanny,folurly,t1_folu3ax,1587870963.0,"I agree. I have a crazy policy that I don’t charge when the kids aren’t here. (I felt guilty for taking money when I didn’t have to care for kids) it is only my 2 year having my daycare. 

After this virus pandemic, I am revising my policy for sure. Both my families are essential workers but both are working from home. One family decided to keep both kids home, due to exposure but is allowing them to go to grandmas and aunties and be with all these people. I charge super cheap compared to other centers In my area too. 

There are a bunch and I wanted to be competitive. But they are taking advantage of my policy. Not just because of the virus. I did briefly close for 2 weeks because of quarantine. Mom begged me to take her baby because she can’t handle her at home working. But basically said she was going to Have to take her elsewhere. 

I opened up only to have her say she’s taking vacation for 2-3 weeks in May. Like if you would have taken her to a center it would have been double my price and you would have had to pay for the spot. 

TL/DR Basically, sometimes a policy change is needed for people to realize they are taking advantage of you."

One of my clients pays me for a whole month the first of every money bank transfer and the other pays the Sunday before she brings her kids for the week. If they don’t pay they can’t drop off kids until it’s paid. I send a reminder text for the one family that pays monthly. I have never had an issue with these parents.

My husband is considered an essential business because he provides Home Depot with their in-house  saw blades. His boss is forcing him to come to work, when his job can be done from home easily. 

People aren’t taking it seriously. His boss is not following the news well and thinks you can only catch the virus by being in close contact with someone. Like kissing. He isn’t following the social distancing policy at all and doesn’t care to. 

I am all for people who need or order take-out being able to do so. It kinda just makes me frustrated when people are not taking anything seriously.

This is too serious to be going to game-stop and Home Depot just because I am bored. It’s selfish and irresponsible. Shut it all down EXCEPT the essential businesses grocery stores and pharmacies. Then maybe we won’t be having major infection control issues that take months and months to recover from. China did this and they are reopening businesses as we speak. A little over 8 weeks after. It’s not in the best interest of politicians to shut businesses down that have funded their campaigns. Period."

Anxiety,f2d2j41,t1_f2avx6j,1570146084.0,"This is me! I will intentionally move over to let someone pass me. Then I also hate walking down the isles in the store too. I know people think I’m a lunatic, I get all hot and flushed if I can’t see an out if there is a ton of people. 👎🏻"
BeautyBoxes,f2d1v20,t3_dcrmly,1570145777.0,When I try to do my make up like that it looks like a bomb exploded on my face. 🤣🤣🤣 basically you rock and are my idol

antiMLM,f2d0t5a,t1_f2cz02z,1570145288.0,It errored out on the first one 😂 I didn’t like the title on the first one
antiMLM,f2ct9xa,t1_f2cp6h7,1570142364.0,I am a nurse and I can’t begin to imagine why. Nurses are underpaid but mannn not that much
antiMLM,f2cfrn9,t3_dcxdrt,1570137614.0,"Notice all the goals are like, pass a test, get an A. Mostly not related to making money. Those are the ones are crossed out too 🤣🤣🤣"

WeightLossNews,f24vgpp,t1_f24qek4,1569961034.0,"I don’t eat bread, if I do it’s usually a low carb version. I’m just not a fan luckily. I’m glad that’s working for you."
WeightLossNews,f24v93x,t1_f24qek4,1569960929.0,"I do all of this already. My issues are triggered by a lot of the healthier foods. Especially cruciferous veggies. I love them, they just really mess me up. Fermented and probiotics also trigger me as well. I drink kombucha almost daily, but I definitely pay a price. I have to wait and see what is actually going on. I have endometriosis and may have crohns. One issue says follow this diet but a lot of my crohns related symptoms are triggered by the very foods that help the other issue. Thank you!"
WeightLossNews,f21q511,t1_f2177we,1569875304.0,"I thought so. I already do CICO, I have a feeling I am about to have to do the elimination diet as well. Waiting to see a GI doctor. I will discuss this as well."
WeightLossNews,f20ug73,t3_d826f0,1569864212.0,With that do you count calories? I am having such bad stomach issues and I know it’s mostly food related (I may have crohns and I already have endometriosis) I have been wanting to go vegan for a while but I am having a hard time making the leap. I already don’t eat much meat (chicken and seafood) cut most of my dairy out too.
endometriosis,eyvt0c2,t3_cyzw3c,1567510599.0,"My pain after sex usually A combo of internal abdominal cramps and then vaginal heaviness if that makes sense, like it literally feels like my vagina is 100 time swollen and my uterus is going to climb out of it at any second. Ugh. I hope you get some relief, I have found using a cold pack in between my legs helps but not all the way."
antiMLM,eyph945,t3_cxy9wt,1567300041.0,Omg I literally just went into one of these today. I was so excited then realize it was Herbalife I literarily turned around and walked out. I didn’t even know they could do this. Smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
CrohnsDisease,exrxlqa,t3_ctwrb1,1566526666.0,"Thank you so much! It is such a struggle to find people who can understand the anxiety piece and the chronic illness piece too. I have thought about it a million times and I know I will do what I need to do to make it work! I have two beautiful children and a husband to take care of and they are here for me as well. It’s so refreshing to hear from everyone, make me feel much better overall and I know I can do this! I will definitely shoot you a message if I need anything. Thank you so much! And yes I am American"
CrohnsDisease,exoptd7,t3_ctwrb1,1566480077.0,"Excellent! My WBCs were a little elevated as well, they gave me a steroid to help with the inflammation and cipro. I definitely felt like it may just be an infection but ofc my anxiety took me to worse case scenarios...I figured that I would have to wait to see what it actually is after testing. I need to see a GI doctor anyways so it will be good to go in. Thank you! I have been trying to stay off google as much as possible. This makes me feel a little better for sure! Your explanation was thorough and precise! ❤️"
BreakingBenjamin,exofngs,t3_ctrwa3,1566475672.0,I’m from Virginia Beach! I’ve seen them over a dozen times. When I moved to Texas I was like ahhhh it’s never gonna happen. They were broken up! They’ve been back here twice since! Still the same! Super good and worth it always. Glad you got to see them!
ChildSupport,exoeuqb,t3_ctrj7t,1566475253.0,"If she receives cash help they will go after you if there isn’t a court order showing support being paid. If you are paying her money you have to report it to the social worker to get credit for it. A lot of times they will still
Make you pay back the minimum. I received tanif (as a child in VA) they made my mother (my sister had custody) pay back 65 dollars per month while I was on it. She was not paying support at the time and they couldn’t find my father. They garnished her wages for the entire time I was on it. Age 7-19, I would call the local social services in California to see what your options are."
Wellthatsucks,exgqdvb,t1_exgdkd9,1566271361.0,"I actually worked as a nurse for years for the surgeons who invented the nuss procedure (minimally invasive) for pectus excavatum. That surgery is close to 80,000 without insurance that doesn’t even include the hospital stay and the procedure to remove the bar. It luckily is covered by most insurances. This was in the USA ofc"
