After this virus pandemic, I am revising my policy for sure. Both my families are essential workers but both are working from home. One family decided to keep both kids home, due to exposure but is allowing them to go to grandmas and aunties and be with all these people. I charge super cheap compared to other centers In my area too. 

There are a bunch and I wanted to be competitive. But they are taking advantage of my policy. Not just because of the virus. I did briefly close for 2 weeks because of quarantine. Mom begged me to take her baby because she can‚Äôt handle her at home working. But basically said she was going to Have to take her elsewhere. 

I opened up only to have her say she‚Äôs taking vacation for 2-3 weeks in May. Like if you would have taken her to a center it would have been double my price and you would have had to pay for the spot.

WeightLossNews,f24v93x,t1_f24qek4,1569960929.0,"I do all of this already. My issues are triggered by a lot of the healthier foods. Especially cruciferous veggies. I love them, they just really mess me up. Fermented and probiotics also trigger me as well. I drink kombucha almost daily, but I definitely pay a price. I have to wait and see what is actually going on. I have endometriosis and may have crohns. One issue says follow this diet but a lot of my crohns related symptoms are triggered by the very foods that help the other issue. Thank you!"

ChildSupport,exoeuqb,t3_ctrj7t,1566475253.0,"If she receives cash help they will go after you if there isn‚Äôt a court order showing support being paid. If you are paying her money you have to report it to the social worker to get credit for it. A lot of times they will still
Make you pay back the minimum. I received tanif (as a child in VA) they made my mother (my sister had custody) pay back 65 dollars per month while I was on it. She was not paying support at the time and they couldn‚Äôt find my father. They garnished her wages for the entire time I was on it. Age 7-19, I would call the local social services in California to see what your options are."
