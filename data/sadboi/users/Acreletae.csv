Aquariums,fp5bhqc,t3_g8vuc1,1588323156.0,"Hi everyone! Is it normal to lose a pleco?? I got a little baby bristlenose pleco the day before yesterday (about 36 hours ago). He's teeny, about 2cm long, and he's gone into my 60L community tank. He's in with my very chilled out betta and some tetras.

I saw him on the back glass about 24 hours ago (where there's some algae), and nothing since then. I put down algae wafers and a piece of bell pepper for him last night, but I can't see any evidence of him being there. No bite marks, no poop in the area.. The tank has a few hiding spots and very thick Java ferns, so he could just be laying low. Should I be worried? He's such a little guy I want to make sure he's okay."

FTMfemininity,fjwzmwy,t3_ff2rif,1583650420.0,"My advice for dealing with attitudes like this is to try and let go of the idea that you have to meet people's expectations of masculinity. If you need help putting stuff together, lifting something, or need emotional support that is okay. That is totally okay! I work in a diy retailer, and I talk men who are three times my age through all kinds of projects. Not knowing something, or needing a second pair of hands, doesn't mean you're not a male. Anyone who says otherwise has a very backwards idea of what maleness is and should therefore be disregarded.

I know that can be easier said than done when it comes to family, and that it's hard to step away from what your family think. For your own sake though, just be yourself. You are masculine. You are enough. You mightn't hit their ideals for masculinity, but that's their problem. It doesn't have to be your problem. My therapist really helped me with this same thing when I first came out, it's been hard but it's been worth it. Maybe you could talk to yours to get some strategies in place for when your family say stuff like this to you?"

Aquariums,f6vpixn,t3_do5fba,1573194521.0,"Hi guys! So I just bought a 94L tank, I'm setting it up for its two-week cycle tomorrow. I'm planning on planting it with some anubias and some Java ferns, for some relatively easy plant cover; I'm also doing some rock and driftwood hardscaping. So there will be lots of hiding spots and cover.

This tank is going to be for a betta fish, once it's ready. My question is: what fish, if any, can I get to be my betta's tankmates? I've heard good things about a school of tetras (I'm looking at neons or rummy noses), and mystery snails, but I'm not sure. Would I be better off just leaving him by himself and forget the community idea?"
