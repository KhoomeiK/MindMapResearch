As supportive partners you should be able to maturely have that conversation together to reach a point where you both feel comfortable about the situation. And if there's more to it that does seem to be a cause for concern, then hopefully it'd come out in that talk. But from what you've written here,  it doesn't seem too serious, and I'd like to think you can just talk it through."

TwoXChromosomes,fhyfn6m,t3_f5fawo,1581974943.0,"Active, enthusiastic consent is the only consent that counts in my book. A sexual act happening to you when you're in a compromised mental state is something else entirely. It sounds like if you had your wits about you, you never would've consented to this. Women are taught to blame themselves for the things that are done to their bodies by others. She didn't ask first, and it sounds like you were only half-conscious. Talk to your boyfriend again and explain it like this, but if he doesn't want to hear it, then that's on him, and not you. Absolve yourself of guilt, and keep that friend who re-explained things to you close--she sounds like a really good friend who cares about your feelings and has your best interest at heart."

actuallesbians,ezybsdl,t1_ezyb0mx,1568264377.0,"Thanks for the info, I'll look into it. In your experiences, though, do you really think it's down to estrogen that you've started having more empathetic thoughts surrounding instances where you're turned on? Or do you think it could be from changing perspectives/becoming more involved in kinder communities/personal growth and such? I'm simply averse to the idea of women as nurturing, men as aggressive type dichotomy; and i feel like attributing these behaviors to hormones is reductionist."
actuallesbians,ezyajdt,t3_d2q0zx,1568263058.0,"Isn't this post super gender essentialist/reinforcing bad stereotypes rooted in sexism? Like, are we really pushing the idea that objectifying women without consideration for anything beyond that objectification is an AMAB trait while more empathetic thoughts of ""they look so happy"" and ""is it rude to watch?"" is down to the presence of estrogen? I would argue that these things are due to differences in male versus female socialization, and not chemicals? We're conscious beings and are able to make our own opinions and think for ourselves.

I just don't see how this is progressive in any way. Please educate me if I've misinterpreted the post's intent, but I feel like this is just pushing the narrative of ""men act a certain way because male brains and female brains have inherently different qualities, and men/transmen/""testosterone brain"" only like sex, whereas women/transwomen/""estrogen brain"" are more emotional and compassionate."" I really do not mean to offend, I'm just trying to understand."
depression,ezv5dkv,t3_d2bay5,1568167609.0,"I'm the same age---and we're YOUNG! It took my father 10 years to get his BA. My friend got his BA at an Ivy League at 29 years old. There are plenty of students who are older than you. Some people change career paths at 35, 40, and older.   


I know it might feel like you're too old to you, but you're not. Perspective is so important. You have so much time to figure out what you want to do. I'm going to be getting my degree soon, but I still don't know what I want to do with it--I'm going to take a few more years before deciding where to go for graduate school.
