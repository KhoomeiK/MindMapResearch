eu4,fnzjr0c,t1_fnziyvg,1587395406.0,"PU means personal Union right ? But it didn’t matter since we were rivals and I had just taken land from them during our last war. But good to know that if I reduce AE by itself, the coalition will dissolve on its own. Coring provinces that I just captured should help, any other tips to reduce AE fast. But that also makes sense as to why when I sued for peace with the pope another coalition formed since my AE was still too high !!!"
