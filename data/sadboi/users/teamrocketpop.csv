mentalhealth,fbm0zt6,t3_edr9q8,1576975436.0,"Apparently telling your partner and her friend, who said they like you and want to help you, that you feel depressed and suicidal (after they emotionally abuse you) is manipulative and blackmailing behaviour and there's something wrong with me that can only be fixed by being blocked and deleted from their lives until I ""get better"". Yep nothing wrong with me, just some asshole that wants your attention, not like I'm a victim of bullying and abusive highschool mean girl behavior. Nope I'm the problem and clearly there's something wrong with me for having emotions about losing the people I love. Couldn't possibly be their fault. I'm just dangerous and need to be feared and the only solution is to suggest I go to the hospital or call the police because I suggested I feel like dying. Some how you're in danger by me feeling suicidal, not me, right? Fuck me for not pretending I'm a well adjusted person like you pretend to. ""Life's hard"" and I should just ""get over it"". It's not like you're being terrible monstrously insensitive awful people and making life hard, no, this is just how life is right? This is just how people treat eachother and I'm supposed to be ok with that, and fuck me for not shutting up when it's inconvenient for you. 

One thing I've learned is everyone is scum, empathy and love don't exist, and we should all just kill eachother until we're extinct. We don't deserve life, as a species."

Even that's not good enough though, I don't have my shit together because I live with my parents and she doesn't want a ""long distance relationship"" if I had a reason to stop saving money and move out, like moving to the city or living with her, I'd have done that

Western culture is so focused on extreme individualism to the point of pure selfishness, that everyone thinks that's it's ok and it's their right to do whatever they want in the name of personal freedom despite the consequences to anyone around them. No one has the right to hurt others and deny their partners or children basic human decency. You may ghost or disown some one but that doesn't ever make you right it makes you an asshole . Every human owes the people in their lives kindness, it is her privilege as citizen of a free country to not be in her life, not her right as a MOTHER to abandon her child if her child needs her, however little she was in her life. And it should be no different for anyone you share an intimate relationship with. She does owe her child, the child has rights too."

I had a brief chance at a better life. for once in my adult life, I thought this wasn't actually going to be my future. She made the difference, let me see what I could have and who I could be. She opened a brief window of opportunity in which I truly wanted to live. But alas, here we are, wasting away on my couch at 3am watching movies I've seen a dozen times, waiting for a reason not to end it afterall. And now even if I tried for a life I wanted, it all wouldn't matter, it's all hollow. I could be rich and adventurous and it would all be empty and meaningless. 

I actually experienced real happiness, friendship, love, hope. I could relate to some one for once, and I was proud to be around her. I felt like I actually accomplished something, felt like I fit in, found the one person I always dreamt of. I saw a mirage, I believed in it, and now the illusion is shattered. This will always be my life."
