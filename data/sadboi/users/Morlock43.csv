As for the having lots of gold.... In my case and in most cases this is from the tokens so isn't that much of a surprise. If there is expensive stuff in game you want... There is a way to get it.

And it's not because people are antisocial or w/e but usually one of these applies:

- they can't get into a guild that is doing this content because that guild is too insular to take new ppl along on the HRC and MYTH content
- they are not good enough or geared enough to actually complete that content without a boosting service

There would not exist a service if there was no demand. The game is fill of people with their faces pressed to the window watching all the special kids playing with the big toys wishing they could join them.

So when these people come along making this offer to at least see and get the benefit from playing with those toys, yes they will take them up on the offer.

Imo blizzard had it right in WotLK when they made ICC much more accessible to a broader group of players. Boosting in those days was not nearly as cancerous as it is now.

But the community wanted better rewards in harder content so at some point someone was going to monetize that shit.

I'm still trying to get Ghuun done just for the story and Nzoth is just a fucking pipe dream.
