Borderline,fg0id9e,t3_ew9enw,1580408408.0,"Hi! I’m diagnosed with both bipolar and borderline disorder amongst other things. The two diagnoses are very similar in symptoms and are often confused with one another. Do you have a psychiatrist? And if yes, how much have you talked before you got your diagnosis? 

Remember; diagnoses are - sort of - a made up language for doctors to both determine the methods of treatment and to address the needs of a patient. It is also an agent for patients to better understand themselves and their challenges. I know several bipolar patients (as well as borderline patients) and none of them have the same symptoms or the same apprehension of themselves and the world as I do myself. I would recommend that you study the diagnoses to learn more about them and talk to your therapist about this query you’re having. Nobody but yourself knows how your world feels. They will most likely listen to your, if you feel your diagnosis is misplaced. 

You can always DM me, if you wanna talk to someone who has some of the same issues as yourself :)"
