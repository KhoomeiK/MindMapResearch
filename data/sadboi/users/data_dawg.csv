Cringetopia,fr52ggc,t1_fr4fibq,1589901312.0,Idk man you kind of lose the privilege of people treating you with respect when you ask a rape victim if she liked the way it felt getting raped. He's a pretty poor excuse for a person.
Cringetopia,fr51c66,t1_fr4vvcj,1589900733.0,"Willing to bet it was just a simple rejection from OP. Sometimes people can't handle being told no. Then, like this guy, they lash out in hilariously embarrassing ways."
Cringetopia,fr511i0,t3_gmjrge,1589900579.0,"He sent that and felt very confident about it, probably told a buddy how he totally pwned some stupid slut. If there is a god out there somewhere, please let the sister see this... If he's not already the father of her baby that is."

fuckthesepeople,fr14iz9,t3_glruib,1589813105.0,"I've heard a lot of controversy around this particular story but it is well known that legitimate rape/abuse videos and child porn are regularly uploaded to pornhub. The argument that content is user uploaded so there's no way to catch everything is bullshit. If there is no way to tell what's real, if there is no way to catch all these videos, then there's something fundamentally wrong. Even if this is some anti-porn fake story, it doesn't excuse the fact that pornhub is a platform for CP. 

Stop trying to argue in favor of pornhub just because you love free porn. The whole ""uwu pornhub so wholesome"" shit is corporate propaganda just like Wendy's twitter and reddit just eats it the fuck up."
