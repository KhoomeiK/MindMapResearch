Really appreciate it!"

AmItheAsshole,fpn9fqw,t1_fpmsg05,1588754880.0,"I'm sure that if they found their child searching ""will people still love me if I'm straight"" than yes. It's not about wanting to talk about sexuality and make a big deal of it. It's about seeing their child stressed and in pain and questioning their parent's love for them and wanting to reassure them."

Aquariums,fp4y2bg,t1_fp4wtst,1588310464.0,"Thank you! I don't mind the look and my fish seemed happy. I just love the stupid things so much and was so worried something was wrong!

Any ideas about how many guppies should be kept in a 20gal/50gal?

I don't want to overcrowd them but also want to keep as many as I can and still have them living their best lives"
Aquariums,fp4w8uw,t1_fp4vnb2,1588309038.0,"Thanks for the advice! I might contact my aquarium and see if they'd take some off my hands!
I do have a mangrove root and some spiderwood in my tank. The spiderwood was boiled before I used it and the mangrove root was soaked for about 2 weeks. Could they be releasing tannins? Is it harmful to my fish?"
AskReddit,fp229of,t3_gasp6c,1588253644.0,"There's been a few... One guy liked me to blow up balloons, put them on his face and sit on them till they popped. 
One guy liked to dress up as a woman and have me fuck him in the ass with a strap on while telling him he was a dirty whore.
One guy liked to give big tips and have me count the money in front of him.
Another liked me to stand on his balls in stilettos.
Oh, one guy liked for me to talk about how I was going to dress him up real slutty and pimp him out.
Mostly, because I looked so young, I got the creeps who wanted me to pretend to be their daughter's friend, their stepdaughter or their daughter or whatever other underage girl they were having disgusting thoughts about. I just told myself that at least they were living out these fantasies in a safe way. 
Wow... haven't thought about that in a while."

I'm a student nurse and it is drilled into us to be very conscious of how we smell, using too much deodorant or scented products. You have to get up close and personal with patients when they're feeling very unwell and overwhelming scents (good or bad) can be hugely uncomfortable for them. 
You did the right thing by letting her know. And it doesn't sound like you were nasty about it. She probably just didn't notice but will hopefully be able to adjust now"
