EatingDisorders,f3b126n,t3_dca606,1570798640.0,"I always refused to accept that my disorder was about control, but after a lot of therapy and self-reflection I’ve realised that that’s exactly what it is. 
So even if you don’t think it’s a control thing... it’s probably a control thing."

Mans just got himself a free dinner. In a society that hates women and piggybacks off of women’s success this disgusts me. Just because you make more money doesn’t mean this misogynistic pig can make you pay. MEN OWE WOMEN FOR CENTURIES OF OPPRESSION, he should be paying you just to be in your presence. 
Don’t forget your worth. I hope you never see that pig again."
AskReddit,euu26k7,t1_eutyvla,1564035892.0,"You’re tired of women having their period? So are most women, my friend. You think it’s fun to involuntary bleed out of your vagina for 4-7 days every single month? Let alone the stigma and embarrassment driven into women (and men like you) to think periods are dirty and disgusting. Blood is blood no matter where it comes from. Women’s periods are magical, it means that their bodies and hormones are working as they should so that one day (if they want to) they can bring a child into this world. 
Yeah sometimes we leak, and yeah it can be very painful for most women, but periods are THE most natural thing a woman’s body can do. 
Maybe check yourself and your internalised misogyny before you speak ill of women again please. I feel very sorry for any woman in your life that she has to put up with you. 

P.S. To all women that DON’T have periods, YOU’RE STILL A WOMAN. Don’t feel less than because your body has decided a different path for you!!"

EatingDisorders,eusds8d,t1_euqkb34,1564006728.0,I’m seeing a specialist psychosexual therapist to deal with my trauma. She does take it seriously and we do talk about food and my eating habits but it’s never anything she’s really worried about because I am a healthy weight. I just talk to her about the behaviours I have and when I b/p or b/r but she never gives me any way of coping with it or things to distract me from my behaviours.

I think it’s really cool and revolutionary, but they could be so much more diverse with the people they portray."

A french film starring Monica Belucci, directed by Gaspar Noe. 
Cinematically it’s a very beautiful film, but the subject matter is disturbing, made me cry like a baby."

It sort of glows bright blue underwater which is how I found it, I think it’s really pretty"
Instagramreality,ercfnpx,t3_c15p2w,1560710886.0,"She looks exactly the same in both images. 
Obviously homegirl knows her angles but either way it’s her choice how she presents herself, she hasn’t photoshopped her body in the image she posted so what’s the issue?"
