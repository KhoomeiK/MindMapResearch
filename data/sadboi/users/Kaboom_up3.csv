The government puts all their money on these places.  The cities aren’t beautiful, five star hotels and restaurants everywhere, it feels as if you’re living in the future. Then you have the rural side you see in this video, these in land villages are a economic mess, houses haven’t been renovated since the 70’s, no pavement roads and only dirt path, the government doesn’t care about these people.
