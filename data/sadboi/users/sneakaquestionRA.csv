I dont know about anyone else but I also suffer from Bi Polar II and suicidal ideation. I can't create a perfect world for myself, it overwhelms me, and that's what CBT/DBT feels like. I can however, come to accept parts of my life and decide what to do about them, if anything at all. Whatever the mechanism is that allows one to move forward right? Even at a snail's pace? I am also highly nihilistic and spiritual, so I am drawn to Daoism (eastern religion based on acceptance).
