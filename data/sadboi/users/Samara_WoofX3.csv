splatoon,fph3xlm,t1_fpgt2zd,1588614532.0,But I thought it was obvious from the different eye markings?
selfharm,ffzxyrl,t1_ffxvrk1,1580395746.0,"Yeah I think I need to figure out why I feel the need in the first place, then I can deal with the root of the problem"
StopSelfHarm,ffzxv6w,t1_ffxlexg,1580395676.0,Yeah I feel much worse when I’m alone so getting out is probably for the best
StopSelfHarm,ffzxt3o,t1_ffxd4si,1580395634.0,"Thank you, I will try them!"
StopSelfHarm,ffzxqh3,t1_ffyc6e6,1580395584.0,"Thank you for this, I think it will help if I can try to identify why I feel the urge to self harm. Maybe if I can find the root of it, I can deal with it that way"
StopSelfHarm,ffzxnte,t1_ffytrdm,1580395532.0,"I don’t have borderline personality disorder, but I actually really like this site! especially the ones about being able to soothe myself without self harm. Sometimes it seems like that’s the only thing that will help, but I have to remind myself that there are other ways, and I’m stronger than succumbing to urges"
StopSelfHarm,ffzxhwk,t1_ffxbx4l,1580395417.0,"Yeah, I think distraction is the best way to cope with urges. It’s just sometimes you cant like during work or school. I haven’t actually cut in about 2 years but I cant help doing things like biting my fingers, or scratching my arms and if possible I want to stop that too."
psychology,ffupp18,t1_fftmlja,1580246929.0,Really really hot showers also work
endometriosis,ffc820r,t3_esthtw,1579793675.0,"In my experience, they almost never shrink away on their own. Ive had a 3 cm one for a year and a half now, it maybe shrunk a half cm over that time. 

You can stop them from growing though. They thrive on estrogen so things that induce menopause like orilissa stop them from getting bigger. Otherwise left on their own they usually grow."
endometriosis,fdk4l3u,t3_ellotp,1578495907.0,Omg yes every night it's so annoying!
endometriosis,f7fmtgi,t3_dvymrp,1573682818.0,"Yep that's how I got diagnosed, when they went to remove the cyst. But they knew it wasn't a normal cyst from the ultrasound, but not sure what kind of cyst"
HadToHurt,f46vme7,t1_f43ofik,1571414026.0,"Yes this so much. My self harming tendencies started at this age and in the same way. Actually had forgotten about it so when I started self harming again as a teenager and learned that I also did things like this when I was 5, it made so much sense. There is/was so much shame and guilt associated with it, I'm so glad I'm not alone in feeling this way! I thought it was just me!"
Endo,exlapaa,t3_ct8idr,1566409331.0,Ohhhhhh I have an adhesion on my left side that feels terrible if I twist a certain way. I hate feeling that awful tugging inside your guts feeling! Glad you found some validation! Wishing you a speedy recovery!!
endometriosis,exjahq2,t3_ct4ekk,1566345564.0,"Been on it for almost a year now and nothing had helped with my pain more! I haven't had a period since I started and my pain is almost nonexistent! Hot flashes really suck, but they're worth it for the decrease in pain. I'm not sure about the depression, I'm already on medication for it so that probably lessened the effect."
SketchDaily,ex2feja,t3_cr3qs2,1565968453.0,Finally finished [this one](https://www.deviantart.com/samarawoof/art/Love-yourself-809842833) I've been working on for a while!
endometriosis,etya63f,t1_etxa7xp,1563315344.0,"So much this. I'm in school studying the inner ear balance system and I found out that I get vertiginous migraines, which might be what you are experiencing. Meclizine is one of the only medications to help with vertigo. It's sold under the brand name ""less drowsy dramamine."""
endometriosis,etr87qt,t1_etr5bzp,1563114813.0,"It's technically different, it works in a different way to stop hormone production, but the end result is the same"
endometriosis,etr80jb,t3_cd1nxw,1563114669.0,"I've been on Orilissa for about 9 months now, and my pain is almost non existent! Nothing has helped with my pain more. But, I get kinda terrible hot flashes. But not having a period for 9 months is pretty awesome! You get the good with the bad."
mildlyinfuriating,et7fnnz,t1_et76bjv,1562530449.0,Huh.... I never knew that! That's interesting!
