depression,et8va7y,t1_et8s10d,1562571897.0,"Yeah totally. I‚Äôm in my early 30s, I work as an event bartender basically. I suffer from depression and it‚Äôs made my self esteem low because the work environment is really toxic at catering and event staffing companies. It‚Äôs strange you get used to a rhythm and an identity and you go with something even when it pays terribly and you could easily be making more money. Once I realized that 90% of the human brain is unconscious and that work is all about creating an identity I started to think more carefully about how I was allowing myself to be degraded in subtle ways. I worked for a company called instawork ‚Äî busted my ass trying to get into their ‚Äúgold star‚Äù program to get better gigs, I washed dishes did all kinds of menial gigs hoping for the better paying jobs and flexibility. 

only to be kicked off when I cancelled on two gigs. I realize only now that it‚Äôs better to be on the path to doing something you like and getting by rather than allow yourself to be degraded. When you look around you wonder why nobody is helping you and the culture tells you and insists on hyper individualism

I often just feel embarrassed and humiliated ‚Äî living at my parents home, waking up and sometimes barely making it through the days. I‚Äôm so used to being by myself it‚Äôs hard to imagine getting back into some kind of office job routine. I was watching this documentary about a prison in Norway where they basically help them relearn how to be another person ‚Äî they make them go to school and work in the prison. And I just look around at our society and i get so sick and tired of people saying that ‚Äúyou‚Äù have to work hard and make it out. But there is no ‚Äúyou‚Äù ‚Äî the brain is a committee there is no center to it. Consciousness is the appearance of the mind itz what it feels like to be you. So much of how we all will get better will be based on what‚Äôs going on around us. Someone says something kind it gives you a small boost ‚Äî but if everything else remains the same change will be very difficult. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much intense self motivational talk you do , we‚Äôre built around habits and routines. There‚Äôs a reason so many drug addicts relapse. It‚Äôs hard to change in a society that is so unforgiving and doesn‚Äôt help people rehabilitate. The wealthier you are and stronger your associations the easier it will be. If you‚Äôre broke and people around you are struggling you won‚Äôt be able to come together because you‚Äôre isolated and divided 

Anyway just a rant maybe I‚Äôll expand on my feelings and actually just make a full post. Man I feel better already :)"

Because if you had at a minimum done that then you would at least be open to talking about it. The fact that people are frothing at that mouth and celebrating hating MLs means that really just have no idea what it is at all // because even if you disagreed understanding concepts like democratic centralism for example or just understanding the real history or the USSR from someone like Stephen Gowan‚Äôs would give you a perspective that would at least make you not hate it.

PsilocybinMushrooms,esixb4l,t1_es8wq9k,1562022003.0,It‚Äôs all connected. The way you view humans and human behavior will be profoundly shaped by how you view politics. Someone who believes in free will and is religious will have a distorted and delusional view of what ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù and human action etc really are. If you study hard determinism vs free will that also connects to the human psyche and consciousness. Truth is all encompassing and requires understanding of a lot of different fields

Drugs,esiww35,t1_es9qj4h,1562021788.0,Just adding to your point about people being products of their environment. Neuroscience and the fact of hard determinism / events being fully caused backs up that assertion.  It‚Äôs because people assume free will that they see people as not products of their environment but merely influenced by it. But it really is that we‚Äôre shaped and a part of it.
EasyTV,esd3qe4,t1_enptmea,1561846290.0,"Ya agree. People see ‚Äúthe law‚Äù as equivalent to what is good and right.

‚ÄúMen make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.

samharris,es4tk7t,t1_es2pczq,1561593537.0,".Andrew yangs specific UBI proposal is very ideological. There‚Äôs no such thing as not having rhetoric or ideological ‚Äî by your set of positions you express your ideology ‚Äî for most Sam Harris fans centrist neoliberalism is a very accurate ideological descriptor. I‚Äôve been a huge Sam Harris reader / watcher for years ‚Äî so I suppose I‚Äôm enlightened and non ideological but if I am against Andrew yang then I‚Äôm ideological and full of rhetoric right? 

In fact, right wing libertarians like Charles Murray and Milton Friedman are supporters of the UBI. ‚ÄúPride privacy concerns or simple ignorance‚Äù ok so the rest of the people in poverty just fuck them right? It‚Äôs irrelevant that people have too much pride to fake welfare provisions. The question is what helps and what doesn‚Äôt? There‚Äôs no evidence that cutting welfare helps people out of poverty or gives them ‚Äúinitiative‚Äù all the evidence goes the other way ‚Äî people who have basic provisions and support we‚Äôd far more likely to find stable employment. What we need is a federal job guarantee and stronger universal programs. A UBI gives a 1000 dollars a month to everyone but it cuts existing provisions people need for support ‚Äî and it highly advantages the rich since middle class and poor people have debt. And there‚Äôs no preventing landlords from upping rent or inflation to take effect, again all benefiting the rich over anyone else. 

Pretending yangs proposal is not ideological or is free of rhetoric is smug centrist posturing. You ignore the existing context , history, or relevance of existing material relations in order to say UBI is good. Ok but what kind of UBI? Kindly watch the critique and read Benjamin studebakers piece then let me know what specific critiques you have. Otherwise you‚Äôre pontificating without acknowledging that you‚Äôve read ANY critique of your position

What do you even know about the welfare state? Welfare provisions statistically help people in poverty and also help with employment. When you remove the welfare state people get poorer and worse off. The level of privilege of saying ‚Äúunhealed‚Äù as a word to describe people who benefit from basic social provisions then having the arrogance to tell someone to stop listening to ‚Äútalking heads‚Äù. Dude you‚Äôre the one who doesn‚Äôt know anything about anything but talks as if you do. Pull your head out of your ass stop smelling your own farts and start reading about the welfare state from a perspective that doesn‚Äôt just parrot the same bs. Nope.
