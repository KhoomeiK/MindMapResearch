raisedbynarcissists,f7jitgi,t3_dwel74,1573778543.0,"This is the most infuriating thing about talking to normal people regarding the things that occurred in my childhood. I used to feel extremely alone when people would start comparing childhood’s or experiences they had, because I never had very much fun or nice things to say. However I am doing much better now because by some weird happenstance I have stumbled into a friend group that almost exclusively consists of people who have endured some sort of parental abuse. 

I think the key to feeling less alone and angry is finding people you can relate to and making them your family. As well as not putting yourself in situations or relationships with people who invalidate your past trauma."

raisedbynarcissists,f5briqw,t3_dnekez,1572124894.0,"People do not seem to understand that accepting that someone is a specific way does not mean you have to accept them into your life. Especially if they are are terrible people. 

My older sister is a genuinely awful almost evil person who physically terrorized me and my little sister every single day for 20 years(that I can remember) She manipulated people, caused conflict, and flat out lied to get herself out of trouble and other people in it. 
People told me I had to accept her and try to repair our relationship, so I did. We talked about everything that had gone on and how we feel about stuff. She blamed me for all of it and spent the whole conversation trying to paint me a sociopath because I have depression. 

So I stopped trying to find a way to make our relationship work. I moved out, and only speak or spend time with her briefly at family functions.

People think that I am being overdramatic or that I’m being selfish because they all believe this is the result of a TBI from concurrent concussions (which she does really have). They have no idea that her behaviour has been this bad since I was literally 4 years old. 

Basically TLDR; fuck anyone who tells you that with acceptance comes forgiveness. You do not need to let your abuser have power over you because of social conventions. 

You worked hard to make yourself better, you don’t deserve being sucked back into the black hole that is a narcissist. Anyone who can’t see it is ignorant."

Okay, everyone’s husband and brother and… everyone died. Okay. Josiah, you had something?” “Yes, I do. How’d you like to be indoors and out of doors all at once?

So a few weeks later I was at an artisanal jewelry making shop with my mother(because homemaking jewelry was her new found passion at the time), and I was in awe of all the beautiful glass and crystal beads. So I ran up to my mother who was on the other side of the store and said “all these beads are so pretty”, and she said “indeed they are”, to which I replied much louder that appropriate(in my enthusiastic haste to show off my new vocabulary) “I guess you could say I have a bead fetish.

I totally get where your coming from. I was 1 1/2 hours late to an appointment of mine, because I literally couldn’t get out of bed until the exact time I was supposed to be there. I was so floaty today that I barely remember the trip to get there,and I fell asleep on the train home. 
I missed my stop and only woke up because the transit security officer woke me up the train had reached the end of the line. Luckily I had enough money to get a taxi because if I had to walk home from where I was, I probably would of sat down and had a full blown cry on the sidewalk.

Sure things were rough and my family didn’t always get along, but in that house it was always “us against the world forever and always, my girlies and me”- mom. 

When I walk through that neighbourhood it’s like a stranger from a dream, I feel like I know it somehow but everything concrete about it is foreign to my eyes. 

My parents weren’t the best parents but their unconventionality, allowed for some of the best memories. The floor in the attic where me and my little sister slept was unfinished plywood so we could spend hours drawing little mini worlds, or making etchings in the dry wall chimney.  

Now when I look at the house that used to be mine and I see the horrible ways that they have desecrated it, I wonder to myself if they even realize the significance of all the art they covered up and stripped away. Or to them was it just the ridiculousness of wayward children. 

Also why would those cunts take out my attic window?

What makes life worth it is finding little moments of light within the people in your life. You might be thinking that you have no one, but as someone who doesn’t really leave the house and has an excessive amount of time to spend talking to random internet peeps, I would love to be your light.

Depending on the store they will sometimes be chill enough to honour the original sale pricing(because chances are that if I’m looking at shoes the slaw pricing is the best part)

Anyway the point is that this Karen is probably going to be turned away with an invalid coupon, and be absolutely roasted behind her back by all the staff. Which is probably not what she desired when she flipped her massive bitch switch."
