StonerPhilosophy,ewvmlvr,t3_cqbbj1,1565809461.0,"I was just thinking about this the other day. When you die you disintegrate into soil back into the earth. Eventually you become a part of the plants in the ground and the air around us. Animals and people feed off the plants, breathe in the air and water. You literally become a part of the earth again."
Anxiety,ewvm09r,t3_cq2yu2,1565809092.0,Yep. So I end up overthinking every word before I say it or I end up not saying it at all. -_-

therapy,ewvlhqo,t3_cq8g05,1565808773.0,"Me too. I feel like I learned it from my dad and my childhood. I never learned how to emotionally process things. It took me a while to even realize that I have an anger issue in the first place, so the fact that you are realizing this is a huge step. And the fact that you realize it‚Äôs a defense mechanism."
BPD,ewvkwz0,t3_cq7jww,1565808415.0,"Yes. I find myself loving the beginning parts of going back to someone.. the flirting, the attention, the feeling of being chosen again.. more than the actual person or the relationship"

socialskills,eweacdn,t1_ew7vxri,1565318456.0,"I definitely try to practice this more. And I feel like there are moments where I‚Äôve improved. But there are more times where I really struggle to make conversation. 

I also feel like because I am so anxious I can‚Äôt really be there in the moment, fully engaging in what they are saying to me so that I can come up with a genuine response. My mind is too busy, and I can‚Äôt fully pay attention to what they‚Äôre saying to me. And it‚Äôs exhausting trying to shut my mind up and trying to be there in the moment while dealing with the anxiety."
mentalhealth,ewe9ttx,t1_ewdvac9,1565318076.0,I can not afford it at the moment. Right now I‚Äôm just trying to get healthy enough so I can work more to afford therapy.

Yes it was a fucked up thing to say to a thirteen year old who just lost their mother. But  growing up in a Korean household, I feel like a lot of Koreans are insensitive to these things. Not saying all but ugh.. the funeral or viewing or whatever you call it was an absolute nightmare
That part where you stand up and everyone comes In a line to pay their condolences to you.. all the Korean b*tches from church kept telling me how proud of how strong I am for being the ‚Äònew mom‚Äô. I wanted to stab every single one of them in their throats.

I do judge myself very hard for running away. Even though I know I was too young I just wonder how it would be if I stayed. I regret the most missing out on my siblings‚Äô lives. Especially my sister 2 years younger than me. She went through college without me, took care of the house and my little brother while worrying where I was and if I was alive. Now that I‚Äôm trying to crawl back after all these years, she‚Äôs not having it which is understandable.

Some days I hate myself for this, I should‚Äôve been less of a coward and just stuck it through for them. 
I want more than anything just to be their sister again.. I guess that‚Äôs one of the things that trips me up the most, that i‚Äôm a reminder of pain to everyone. 

We all definitely need therapy. My dream one day is if my siblings, my dad and I could all sit together and talk things out. I realize this will take a lot of time..I just need to survive in the mean time and try to look only forward 



It truly means so much that you took the time out to read and respond to me. Thank you, kind soul ‚ù§Ô∏è"

socialskills,ew4nm4f,t3_cmtus2,1565114436.0,"YES. You literally described me. I get so exhausted just the idea of hanging out with someone. And during I‚Äôm so focused on not coming off weird or awkward or making sure I say the right things when really I just want to go home and not have to do this at all. I can never just really embrace the moment in a social situation, my mind is always racing. 

I always envied people who are extroverted have tons of friends and are just okay with having no alone time.  They actually enjoy being there, in the moment. Instead I‚Äôm so inside my own head, analyzing every little thing. 

People always call me out for being so ‚Äúquiet‚Äù when really I‚Äôm just mentally exhausted from analyzing everyone else and trying not to come off socially awkward."

therapy,ew4h8ab,t1_ew4gtxn,1565110573.0,"Yes I have seen two in the past. Both very awkward and not so great experiences. I want to try to find a good one but I can‚Äôt afford it anymore. 

So I thought I‚Äôd give reddit a shot. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends or family to talk to so I think it‚Äôs healthy if I just start writing it out and maybe get some outside perspective on it."
