I‚Äôve read multiple articles of parents who felt the same way. But for the sake of your kids you should consider therapy. It‚Äôs unfair to your kids to have an unloving father, even if your feelings are justifiable. This can seriously fuck them up. You might never be about to have that life changing love experience but I think it‚Äôs possible to bond with them. I really hope things get better for you and wish you the best."

I‚Äôm not exactly ready for us to move in together and this gives us the option to see each other way more than every 6 months or so. If you‚Äôre girlfriend is considering it, make sure she has interviews with the families to see what their expectations are and be transparent about everything.
