I tossed so many expired cream items, and decided to give away tons of items that I don't wear (mostly bright color, single eyeshadow pans from Ipsy). It felt incredible. My makeup area looks beautiful now!

It feels so good to finally see everything I own, and be able to carefully choose what I put on every day. It's also given me a chance to analyze my collection and reveal that I already have plenty of what I like. Even some items that are dupes for each other.

I tossed out like 10 old lipsticks, and now I don't have a use my large acrylic lipstick holder anymore! Just my little one. Anyone have a recommendation for another use for it?"

I'm slow with highlighter. I'm also slow with blush, but that's just because I use so many different ones lately. When I stick to one, it can take me only a couple months to hit pan. I'm VERY slow with lipstick, but I use tinted lip balms much more easily.

I also hardly use eye shadow. I usually just take my blush/bronzer up into my eye crease for a simple look."

I think you look fabulous, and I love your hair color. That tone is really cute on you. Also, I think your nose is just fine - unique if anything. Unless it has caused you a lot of stress over the course of many years, I'd consider not touching it!

I would recommend changing your part to a side part. I think it would be really flattering! Try it and see what you think.

I'd work on finding colors, textures, and silhouettes that flatter you new body type. I'd add in some kind of jewelry - whether it's colorful and fun, or dainty and minimal simple silver. Gold may not mesh with your skin tone - you appear to be fair with a great pink undertone here.

I'd also work on finding easy makeup products that bring out the beautiful tones of your complexion. Mac has a blush called Peony Petal that is a bright blue-ish pink. It's stunning on fair skin! Colors like that will look nice on your skin tone. You also may want to find a subtle bronzer to bring in some definition of your fabulous features. Physician's Formula's butter bronzer line has a fair bronzer that may work for you.

I can also see you wearing something glossy or hydrating on your lips. You have great lips and I think something glossy/hydrating could bring them out even more. Even some Vaseline on top of a dab of lipstick would be great!

As for eyes, I can see you wearing a simple mascara on the day-to-day. You have great big eyes and don't need much!

I see you have a little under eye darkness - we all do - and I have a ton! Especially as a fellow fair skinned person. I use Becca's undereye brightening corrector and I love it. I don't even usually wear concealer on top of it. It lightens up my purpley tones just enough."
