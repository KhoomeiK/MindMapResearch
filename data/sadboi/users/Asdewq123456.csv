Maintaining a routine is difficult. You should be proud that you did this and other things. It is amazing how hard it is to make a decision, see a problem, take action. Many days, it took a lot of effort to not fall out of the chair.

Ignore people that tell you to exercise, that you would not be depressed if you did not want to, etc.  tell yourself everyday that you are doing the best you can for that day.

depression,fpd0dg0,t1_fpcxlng,1588517097.0,"I am an alcoholic and a drug addict. I have been clean and sober for 39 years. 

Recently, I was talking to a friend.  My State was legalizing weed and I was thinking about trying it again. I told him about that. I started telling him of bad experiences I had with drugs. He said he never had a problem with weed.

I thought about this and why this occurred. The answer is this. A mental illness is a brain problem. The illness destabilizes you. It is poorly understood. When you do drugs or drink, here is some comments.

Yes weed will refocus your attention away from the illness. I did it for three days straight.  right before I was hospitalized for 11 weeks. It took me 4 years of intense effort to stabilize.

Drugs and alcohol are depressants. When I was drinking, I was trying to kill myself or just die.

These things keep medicine from  stabilizing. Medicines are difficult to manage always.  So you will not ever stabilize. The Dr will not have the ability to diagnose.

If you are in therapy, you are there to treat an illness. Drug use and alcohol are different illnesses and require different treatments. It is difficult to stabilize  an illness on its own.

I doubt if many therapists will treat you if you us e these things. If you are suicidal, it will be very difficult to find someone to treat you.
Drugs and alcohol are risky. I used to drive drunk all the time. I am still ashamed of that. I could have killed someone. I could have wound up in jail. I was lucky. As for drugs you will go to jail for possession.

I do not tell people what to do. That is up to you. You are the one that benefits or suffers from your decisions..

I always say if you want to do drugs or drink, you should stop therapy for an illness. You need therapy for drug use or alcoholism. These ares symptoms  of an illness. In therapy you can deal with those symptoms.

Full disclosure - I have had numerous suicide attempts  I had one 3 months ago for three days. No one knows about it - I managed it on my own. I do not recommend that.  So I can tell you what drugs and  alcohol do to people. You may look at me as a success story. I have had 2 Drs and both sId i they were amazed that I was able to stay alive. Not a good thing to experience. 

Don’t be like me"

depression,fpcx95z,t1_fpcloxb,1588515035.0,"No one likes hospitalization. If you are hospitalized it is because you need help. I was hospitalized twice for three months back to back in my thirties because I was suicidal. I was stabilized and my drug routine was monitored. Once I got out of the hospital I started on recovery which took 4 years.

I go on the mental health sites because I am bipolar. It helps me to share my stories. I realize how people that have a illness share things in common. 

As far as the illness goes, rather than look at a long term solution, focus on that day. Do what you can that day. When I was stuck I said to my doctor, I could do better at work and have a relationship, etc. he said a profound thing. He said how do you know you could do better. Whatever you do today is the best you could do for that day. I have severe prolonged depressions. Many times the best I could that day was to just sit in a chair and not self harm. 

I am 70 years old and some of the things I write about presently I realized in the past year. So I did not have answers despite 50 years of treatment.  There are no answers definitive.

Last night - last night - I understood something. Mental illness is not like other illnesses. It does not go away in most cases. The best strategy is to live day by day. You will have good days and bad days. When you stabilize it is a great experience.

Two things I always say. If you are suicidal seek help. Do not drink or use drugs. They will really mess with your head."
depression,fpcu7vh,t3_gcesau,1588512810.0,"Here is an idea. Use social media to reach out to people. It is anonymous and you have many women to talk to. Look at how you feel. There are a lot of women that are just like you.

There is a lot of loneliness in the world especially now. There was a lot when I was dating in the 70s and 80s. I like being alone because I have brutal depressions. I do not like people getting close to me.

So think about this. I responded to your question. There are probably others who could. So go to multiple sites and respond to what others say. You can learn social skills gradually. Once your confidence builds up then you can take it to the next level.

I think you will do ok if you search. You have a lot of interests and you are looking for answers.

The Dr cannot treat the symptoms and he cannot prescribe and treat with medicines. I believe that people can do one or the other not both.

Suicidal thoughts can be mitigated. My Dr said that sometimes it is an episode that occurs once and goes away.

Life sucks even if you are not depressed. People die, people lose friends, and people suffer terrible things. There is no cause, god does not love or hate you.

Suicidal thoughts exaggerate typical stressors. Depression is terrible. I cannot absorb your pain or even understand it. It isolates you.

LeopardsAteMyFace,fp3io30,t3_gayh3c,1588279972.0,"FYI by forcing businesses to reopen, they lose business continuity insurance, employees lose unemployment benefits, they are put at risk of death. And if you think people are going to go out to a restaurant now we have a difference of opinion.

In my opinion, this is an attempt to kill people.

And to all the people urging a rush to end quarantine, the blood is on your hands.

And to all the states who want to reopen be careful what you wish for"
depression,fp3htzw,t3_gaxui1,1588279559.0, I was 27 before I realized that i5 was not common people to not want to kill themselves.  I still cannot know what it is like to live without that obsession.
bipolar,fp16y73,t1_fp159gm,1588226148.0,"Medicines  do not work fast. It takes awhile to reach the proper level. It takes time to do that and then takes time to evaluate how it works on you. Prescribing medicines take time and the Dr has diagnose you. Each medicine works for a different problem so it may take more than one.

Trust your Dr. your life will improve greatly. Do not compare medicines with others. Each person reacts differently.

I have been in therapy 50 years. I cannot predict how an illness changes. When you get it right it is wonderful.

Do not drink or take drugs. Your illness will be difficult to control.otherwise.."
bipolar,fp1284f,t3_gabt51,1588222435.0,"Regardless of the diagnosis, Drs treat  the behaviors.

I am bipolar, I have asked similar questions.  Numerous times. I think it is common.

Do not stop your meds unless your Dr says.it is dangerous. It can reduce the severity of the swings. If you stop meds you can have severe break.

When you read about something tragic a manic depressive did, there is a sentence in there that says they stopped taking their medicines.

Meds work with you reach the desired dosage level. If you stop taking meds the level will change and the Dr will not know why.

Also, my Dr said that if I stopped taking meds,they may not work If I went back to those.

If you have reactions to meds tell your Dr. he could change them.

It is hard to stay on a routine of taking medicines every day."
bipolar,fp11gky,t3_ga6gvq,1588221885.0,"I never thought I would make it to age 40. Am 71 now. Two psychiatrists were amazed I stayed alive. Numerous suicide attempts,"
bipolar,fp11bib,t3_gai4jy,1588221786.0,That is a common problem and dangerous.
bipolar,fp11819,t1_fot6dvq,1588221720.0,I thought lithium controlled mania mostly. Is that your experience?
sex,fp0ncvv,t1_fp0koha,1588212777.0,"Very insightful. When I was younger sex was a powerful influencer. In hindsight I wish men and women could relax and be human about sex. It is difficult.

You seem strong enough to communicate this to a man and change. It is hard for a man to relate."
sex,fp0km0y,t3_gal3y5,1588211155.0,"I am an old guy. Looking back I can tell you sex intimacy feelings and the neuroses that people experience when they are single are incredibly complex. I did not get married until I was 45  my opinion is that there is no norm,no ideal standard. People need to work out there own problems first before they get involved with someone else.

I have no answers or suggestions. I am glad I am old now and married and do not have to deal with these problems.

Good luck"
sex,fp0jt1m,t3_gah3c1,1588210687.0,"Yes to the first question.  I think during intimacy feelings are heightened and it is easy to inadvertently say hurtful things and it also easy to overreact. I am a boomer and looking back sex was always complicated.

As to the loose comment, well I think he should have thought it through more."
sex,fp0j98o,t3_galjg6,1588210374.0,"Guys are dogs in heat. If a man complains about your body just ask him if he is gay. That will silence him. Lol

I was single for a long time. Body issues for women are common and difficult to resolve. Men dump  a lot of shit on women. In this light, it is hard to work out the vulnerability. Women devote a lot of time pleasing men. One issue is that men cannot communicate their feelings well (myself included). Plus intimate issues like this bring a relationship closer and it scares men. I did not get married till I was 46 so many of these things I experienced. Once I got married I matured and opened up.

I may lose my man card for saying this but guys have a lot of problems sexually too. It is hard for them to deal with them so they project anger onto women.

Keep looking and asking questions. You can find better partners once you identify what you want."
sex,fp0hxca,t3_galn3c,1588209616.0,"Read up on it on the internet. talk to him about it.  There is a lot involved.  I never did this with a woman because I was too catholic.

There is a lot going on with anal sex. It pays to learn

Looking back I can see it could have been fun"
sex,fp0hhjj,t3_gab5br,1588209365.0,When you find out let the rest of us know. This is the best fun of being a teenager.
sex,fp0hbdg,t3_gacg0q,1588209267.0,"I do not think you need therapy because of this. I am a male 65+. As I matured, I began to see feelings like this are common. I think women especially are body shamed and held up to higher standard. You go into detail about your body specifics.  One thing, is I do not think that men really notice or care. If they did care and said so, I would think they are weird and maybe have a fetish. 

I was single a long time. I enjoyed women that were just people. I generally liked the person first so the sexual issues became less important.

Women generally in my experience have issues like yours. When I was dating, they could not talk about it. Lot of body shaming and embarrassment. Men are immature about sex.

Ideally, it would be nice if people could avoid this and be comfortable with their nudity"
