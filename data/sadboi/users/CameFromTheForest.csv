shroomery,fr4alrs,t1_fqytm9s,1589881782.0,"I’ve put together some [quick images](https://imgur.com/gallery/vCrS5Ok) on the progress so far. Unfortunately I’ve been swamped with work lately due to the coronavirus so I haven’t been able to dedicate the time to complete this project and write up a how-to guide. I will endeavour to put something together in the next couple of weeks. Below is a quick brief of where it’s currently at:

* Two DHT22 sensors take temperature reading from the top and bottom of the SGFC. Ambient temperature and humidity is calculated as the average from both sensors.
* LCD display, front mounted on the SGFC, displays the ambient temperature and humidity.
* A 6500k LED G10 bulb is controlled by a relay. Switches on at 06:30 local time and switches off at 18:30 local time. Time on range is easily adjustable. The light is fitted to the underside of a shelve above the SGFC.
* A simple magnetic door contact had been fitted to the SGFC and it’s lid. This allows the program to know when the lid is open.
* A 12v PC fan, controlled by a relay, is fitted to the underside of the shelve above the SGFC and blows in the direction of the SGFC lid. A 2cm gap has been left between the fan and the shelve to allow air to be sucked into the fan.
* When the program determines that the lid has been removed from the SGFC it switches the fan on. When the lid is put back on the fan is switches off. This means that you don’t need to manually fan the SGFC, you simply take the lid off for a couple of minutes to increase FAE.
* Two double socket drywall back boxes are installed on the bottom of the SGFC with holes through them. They act as stable feet while also raising the SGFC off the surface it sits on to allow fresh air to be drawn up through the perlite.

It has worked really well and requires minimum intervention (misting morning and night and occasionally take the lid off to allow the fan to switch on).

Here are [some images](https://imgur.com/gallery/8vzVlhb) of mushrooms grown in the SGFC. This is my first time growing so they weren’t fantastic or huge, but from three cakes and three flushes I got approximately 42 grams dried.

I will definitely put together a full how-to guide including full python code for the SGFC once my work calms down a bit. Hope this guide update helped and feel free to ask any questions if you need any further info.

Edit:
One thing I should note, and I think another user pointed this problem out too, is that the DHT22 sensor is accurate for the first week or so, then after them at the humidity reading isn’t accurate at all. As you can see from my images the humidity is being read at 99.90%; I doubt this is accurate as the lid isn’t on and I haven’t watered the basil today. I will probably look for a more reliable humidity sensor for the next iteration of this project."

bipolar,fn681t1,t1_fn65r3a,1586691049.0,"I’ve had the same experience as you have with anti-anxiety meds; anti-anxiety meds give me real bad anxiety! If it wasn’t serious I’d laugh at it. I felt like banging my head against a wall when I told people that anti-anxiety meds gave me anxiety and they didn’t believe me.

I still get physical pains in my upper left chest at night with medications. I know exactly where the pain is. I even drew a heart on my chest to visualise where my heart is and where the pain is. It’s really difficult but I have to tell myself on a night that the pain is just my bodies response to anxiety and that my heart isn’t going to stop working.

I’m glad my comment was helpful. I hope you manage to get some good sleep and some respite from the palpitations. Also know that it’s totally ok to need to go to hospital if you feel like it, the paramedics told me both times that I’m not wasting their time and when it comes to your heart it’s ok to want to get it checked out."
shrooms,fn6741q,t1_fn66g76,1586690034.0,"Sounds similar to me, no matter what high dose of antipsychotics and/or antidepressants the doc pumped me with, I’d still be a lose cannon with a destructive lifestyle and always on the edge of a really depressive phase. I don’t see the point in taking pills if they’re definitely not helping. The more I researched about mushrooms, both ‘normal’ and psychedelic, the more I got into it. I’m kinda trying to channel my messed up brain and it’s ways to really get into mycology. I like mushrooms because they’re weird like me. I wish you guys good luck and hope your girlfriend has success with the mushrooms."
shrooms,fn664eb,t3_fzu3r1,1586688921.0,"It’s tough. It’s doable but you’ve got to proceed with extreme caution as, as others have said, you’re toying with someone’s mental health and brain chemistry. I’m bipolar and was prescribed both antidepressants and antipsychotics. Psychiatrist cycled me through maybe five or six different medications and none of them worked completely as they should have. Having used psychedelics on and off for about five years, and having done some research and reading up on microdosing, I decided to give it a crack. I took some time off work and weaned off my meds over the course of 8 weeks (without telling my psych); my partner wasn’t too happy about this. Anyway, once completely off meds and feeling relatively stable, I microdosed LSD after reading Ayelet Waldman’s book “A Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference in My Mood, My Marriage, and My Life”. To cut a long story short, microdosing LSD didn’t work for me, it made me manic and I couldn’t sleep without using sleeping pills. Went back on meds for six months. Then came off them in a similar way. Then microdosed mushrooms following the Fadiman schedule. It was bumpy at first as I remained on the edge of mania for about three weeks. Then I dipped into a slight depressive phase. But at week five I levelled out and I can honestly say that I felt fantastic, work was great, sleep was great, I was exercising five days a week and having more sex with my partner. I stopped microdosing after 9 weeks as I ran out of mushrooms. This was in January/February; I’m still off my meds and feel great most of the time. Currently growing more mushrooms and planning to microdose again from May. One thing I’d say is don’t force her into it. She shouldn’t be coming off her meds and starting a microdosing schedule for your benefit, if should be for her benefit and should be her decision. With all this said, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that there are benefits to this. If your girlfriend feels she can handle coming off her meds and she can rely on you to be there for her incase it does go south, then I think it’s definitely worth trying. Final note, both you and your partner should keep a diary throughout the process. It’s a great way to keep a track on how things are going and can help identify if things may be starting to go south."
bipolar,fn65087,t3_fzu40o,1586687659.0,"I HATE this. I ended up in A&E three times because of heart palpitations from anti-psychotics. I have the exact same feeling as you do, I’m lay in bed thinking that my heart will simply just stop working at any second. Anti-psychotics gave me real bad anxiety; my heart would be racing, I’d be physically shaking and sweating thinking I was about to die. My partner had to call the ambulance several times. Every time they done an ECG and they told me that my heart was perfectly healthy and that nothing was wrong. I no longer take anti-psychotics and simply have to rough it out. Because of this I go through periods of using and abusing Zopiclone to help with the sleep. I feel for you I really do. It’s the worst feeling in the world. Have you spoke to your psych about the heart palpitations and anxiety from anti-psychotics?"
