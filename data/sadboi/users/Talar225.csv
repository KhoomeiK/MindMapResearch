2.5 tsp baking powder
Eggs for egg wash

Method 
Get a giant bowl and place the dry ingredients and mix them. Then you take the wet ingredients and put them in top. Knead by hand until a dough forms, add extra flour if it is too oily. Let rest 45 mins. Cut into the shapes you want, then egg wash. Bake at 350 degrees until they are golden brown. Enjoy and Shnorhavor Sourp Zadig!"
