AskReddit,evagn10,t3_ciwolg,1564347228.0,"Going to Rome with my high school wind ensemble last spring break; it was just like taking a vacation with a bunch of my friends. It was a great bonding moment for me and my friends cause even though we hang out a lot we don‚Äôt really talk about each other and usually just talk about music or make jokes. The night before we left, two friends from another group came over to my hotel room. All we did was talk. We talked where some of them were going to college, we talked about our first impressions of each other, and just an all around chill conversation. I‚Äôll never forget that moment we didn‚Äôt talk as bros or musicians, but as friends."
