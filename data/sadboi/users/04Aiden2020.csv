You flipped a political message on its head and are now saying that ‚Äúopposing racism should not be political‚Äù. How can I have a reasonable conversation with you when you declare ‚Äúanyone that supports trump has a mental illness‚Äù? And no, I do not support Trump but I will call out your ‚Äúgotcha moment‚Äù styled arguments. Stop the ideologue talk."
