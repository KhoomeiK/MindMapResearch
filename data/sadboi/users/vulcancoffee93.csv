A love lost that nobody will ever hold a flame to, until someone burns the entire home you once had down.

Just the mental image of the dead flower had me feeling so much pain and loss and grief, for you.

EatingDisorders,fqtels7,t3_gksnm8,1589637436.0,"Losing weight while recovering from a restrictive eating disorder is extremely counterproductive and could possibly trigger all of those built up emotions from tumbling back into your life. Eating disorders are tricky and they can disguise themselves as ""I just want to lose a couple of pounds""... and then it's a full blown relapse. Unless you're absolutely in danger from a medical condition, please think this through! The weight will rarely kill you, whereas the eating disorder will kill you if you let it!

Overall, however, movement, walking and dance are all types of therapy that are extremely beneficial to those recovering from eating disorders - maybe just try to move more while appreciating that your body is able to do all the movements you want it to! Go for a nature walk and be mindful of all that exists around you :) My final suggestion is to stay off the scale; measure yourself in happiness and smiles, not pounds. The scale is the biggest culprit for initiating relapses! I believe in you!"

EatingDisorders,fqmxw1k,t3_gjk0hr,1589485361.0,"Definitely reach out to a mental health professional if you're in a position to do so - there are plenty of online resources and telephone lines for eating disorders that you can reach out to when the ""voices"" or the shame becomes too much. 

I can tell you that there is something called a binge-restrict cycle that leads back to the evolutionary wiring of your brain. The brain is focused on one thing: survival. And for that brain, ensuring it has enough energy (calories/food) to last it until it's able to find more is always priority number one (unless you're in immediate danger). As our bodies and the world around us evolved, our brains haven't evolved to the point yet where it sees weight loss and restriction as a conscious choice, and instead sees both as possibly detrimental situations that it needs to remedy. When you begin to restrict your intake, your brain begins to notice the lack of energy coming into the body and that the body it's controlling is using it's energy stores, rather than being able to rely on the food it's eating to fuel it. In many people, this triggers what we now know as a ""binge"" - when your senses pick up that you're surrounded by food and sustenance your brain switches into the autopilot-survival mode and automatically begins eating large quantities of food because it doesn't know when it will get a reliable source of food next. The brain (as a survival organ) does not, however, understand the resulting feelings of depression, anxiety, shame and low self esteem that typically accompany the binge. This is not your fault. You're not less of a person because of your eating disorder, and you certainly don't deserve to feel out of control or powerless when you're around food. 

Reach out to someone you trust! And try to remember that binging is your brain's way of trying to keep you alive; it's not any kind of reflection on you. I hope you're going to be okay!"

My schedule never changed and I began seeing his car and occasionally his friends' cars along my drive, always parked off from the road a little and around some seriously sharp corners. At first I didn't think anything of it, until it began happening at night (I'd do inventory every Tuesday night and be at work until 10pm; this was my only full night shift). This went on for about a month, until I started switching my routes to and from work because I was getting creeped out. Easter ended up rolling around and I, again, had to stay late to help my coworker change the signage (I worked at Subway). It was getting close to 9pm, and the work phone began ringing off the hook (was my ex). My coworker, who knew what was going on, just muted the phone and we continued doing what we needed to do. Shortly after we saw my ex standing outside, in the middle of the road staring into the restaurant. I hid behind the counter as soon as I could and my coworker ended up telling me when he left. Got calmed down until we got to my car to find out he broke into my car and left a bunch of weed and a threatening note.

EatingDisorders,fqhxh9d,t3_givuuy,1589386300.0,"Binge eating is known to come out when a person is seeking comfort and control - in a quarantine/lockdown, everyone is additionally stressed, panicked and paranoid, often times making their coping mechanisms (although unhealthy) worse. Binge eating is also scientifically part of a vicious cycle known as the binge-restrict cycle. A person's brain is wired as if we are all still cavemen; food, shelter, survival. When someone begins restricting their intake in order to lose weight, our brains don't necessarily recognize this as ""a move to be healthy"" and instead sees it as a lack of food (one of the keys to remaining alive) and then when it comes in contact with the availability of food (especially under extremely stressful circumstances) it binges, thinking it needs to store the extra calories (also known to your brain as energy) for later use just in case it doesn't have access to food.

Ultimately, your wife probably needs to undergo therapy - alot of eating disorders, especially those that are binge related, stem from traumas that she may or may not be conscious of. Right now she probably feels ashamed, uncomfortable, out of control and so terrified of not only losing herself but also you. One thing I want you to try and remember is that when these binges are happening, your wife feels completely out of control. A few things that have helped others in my past include: grounding exercises when she feels like she's about to binge (this can be anything from taking deep breaths and trying to be more mindful of her surroundings to talking to someone about how she's feeling at the moment), keeping a journal of her feelings and emotions and trying to find triggers, to simply going for a walk or trying to do something nice for herself (bubble bath? painting her nails? watching her favorite shows or playing her favorite board games?). Her health is absolutely a priority, but her mental health needs to be taken into consideration as well :) After a binge, try to encourage her to drink plenty of water (it helps flush a person's system and get rid of excess chemicals), and try some light exercises (walking, yoga, stretching) to keep her endocrine system moving. 

Finally, take care of yourself too! Her eating disorder can take a toll on you more than you could ever realize; watch your feelings and thoughts and take some self care time for you as well. Reaching out is always the best option in times like these and I wish you both the best!"

I know that while on quarantine I have been enjoying the more isolated aspect, but I have also been finding myself missing the physical interaction of hugging my friends. I feel the same way about hugging my family though, I love hugging friends and SOs because they're chosen family but biological family can just be awkward, despite my love for them!"

intj,fqesa07,t1_fqejqvq,1589312757.0,"I'm so sorry you've experienced such hurt and detriment to your ideas of care. I propose that possibly, where hugging is a more universal act of care rather than individualized, you allowed your personal feelings for the person to be misguided by their enjoyment of hugging and when you became emotionally injured by that person, you now take out your pain on anybody who ""doesn't commit to caring"". It's extremely nihilistic and doesn't actually prevent further hurt from accruing."

I understand this! When it's of my own volition, I adore being hugged and cuddled but when I need my space and my time, I cannot stand being touched - upon introspection, I've realized my enjoyment of hugs is so dependent on my mood and who the person hugging me is."

intj,fqefzpe,t3_gi9ssp,1589306925.0,"Personally, I enjoy social media to keep in touch with those I am no longer physically close to (moved away from all of my family and friends) and I enjoy the outlet to share my passions (Instagram for Photography and Facebook for Positivity and Science Facts), however I do oftentimes catch myself getting caught up in all the ""fake realities"" people are living and occasionally end up feeling quite odd/left out because I don't have a similar lifestyle. 

I do enjoy Reddit as a way to communicate with likeminded and openminded people, as far as social media goes and it is a much more open community in which I am able to shut off from it for periods of time without people messaging/notifying constantly."

Social media is also a curse for making people automatically compare their lives to the seemingly perfect lives of others -- don't let yourself fall into the trap of ""they have the perfect life, the happy smiles, the big groups of friends, maybe I should too!"". In my experience, having a few close friends whom you trust to be yourself around is so much better than a large group of acquaintances :) Fear of being left out is an interesting concept, perpetuated by the mainstream social media and society's constructed ideal on how a person should act (depending on age, gender, working or no, etc.)"
AskReddit,fk2q355,t3_ffyx50,1583806554.0,I  work at a convenience store during the day and today a teenager came in (probably about 16 years old?) with his debit card and when it wouldn't tap I had to teach him how to insert his card/read the screen/follow the prompts and overall how to use his own debit card.
EatingDisorders,fk2om79,t3_fg18ox,1583805605.0,"For the most part, nurses and E.R. Doctors (and medical professionals in general that don't specialize in eating disorders) have a very clear cut guideline on what constitutes an eating disorder and the negative physical effects of the mental disorder. Anorexia or OSFED (which is any combination of eating disorder behaviors and symptoms without a BMI of under 18) typically present with heart palpitations (especially while standing in the shower - the hot water makes your heart work harder thus raising your heart rate giving you the dizzy/woozy feeling), picky/selective eating, other underlying mental health illnesses (such as depression or anxiety), and mainly weight loss, especially if it's a significant amount in a short period of time. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if the nurse/doctor truly meant to scare you like this, but talking to a professional about how you're feeling/your mental health and coming up with coping mechanisms truly wouldn't hurt your levels of stress! Sometimes eating disorders are brought on by immense amounts of stress, especially if you're feeling out of control in your life and your subconscious is looking for a way to regain that feeling of control (thus, your food intake is lessened and more selective). If you're still self-harming, you should definitely talk to someone in a therapy session! Hope you feel better!"
