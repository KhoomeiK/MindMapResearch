i mean sure, most synths have a few basic things in common like oscillators, filters etc. but there's some things that are unique to one synth. 
for example, most of the things you can do with resampling in harmor are unique and unmatched. 
the way serum allows you to do FM with two wavetables and modulate any parameter at audio rates using the noise oscillator. thats not commonplace on other synths, its just a serum thing. 

but even with basic plugins, these are specialist tools. professionals use them on hit records. they require a lot of hours programming, debugging, giving extended tech support etc etc."

3. ToTape (an accurate yet transparent high-end tape sim. like all other airwindows plugins, the algorithm is really simple and elegant which gives a great sound but with very small cpu load. but it really does give softube tape a run for its money)

4. powersag (kind of like a weird compressor/saturator hybrid that simulates analog gear being starved of power, but it adds some subtle mojo if you use it in parallel).

 but take acoustic guitar for example; when the string is plucked some of the impact and transient is actually a low end ""thud"" and loses some of its impact if you simply cut all the lows. 

there's no need to completely avoid low end up non-bass instruments, the key thing you need to avoid mud is the low end needs to be tight. so that means things like reverb and long pads can have a muddy low end but something with quick low end transients wont"
