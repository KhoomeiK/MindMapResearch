ptsd,f6vkfs7,t3_dt65cl,1573188965.0,Situations like this happens. Stories like yours are major motivations for me to become a better man in this world. The major thing is take it one step at a time. Don’t overwork ur body or your mind. It’s sad that sleeping is complex. I would have said try medication but am not sure how you will. Try listening to calm music and try watching shows or cartoons that make you happy (Funny YouTube videos could be a good idea) . Also therapy is a major thing as well. Hopefully things go well and your successful in school
