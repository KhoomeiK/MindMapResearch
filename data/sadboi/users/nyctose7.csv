i have nightmares and flashbacks to this day, and i still am mature/reasonable enough to understand that his actions are on him, rather than casting more shame on everybody living with this incredibly stigmatized disorder. i removed him from my life and started focusing on my healing, rather than spreading harmful judgments towards the disorder he may or may not have, and everybody else diagnosed or accused of having it. 

bear in mind, different psychologists won‚Äôt even reach a consistent diagnosis of the same person, so while you may feel certain you‚Äôve known people with NPD, you do not have the authority to label complete strangers with any type of personality disorder based on someone else‚Äôs account of the situation.

3.  be straight up. if this is someone whose opinion you don‚Äôt care too much about, tell them that you act really flirty but you‚Äôre not actually serious and will reject them. no one likes getting shut down so hopefully that will discourage them. or, with good friends, just tell them that this is something you struggle with and emphasize that when you do act on these impulses, it always ends poorly and one or both parties involved end up feeling messed up about it. again, the idea is to convince them that it‚Äôs not gonna be worth it.

BipolarReddit,f4vwncb,t3_dm08vs,1571848876.0,"it worked wonders for me! the very first day of taking it, i got to work to find out the higher ups were gonna be there watching our every move and judging how well we followed procedures. after i took the first pill i still had some anxious thoughts but i never got the spiral of physical symptoms that always made me panic more. i could just brush the thoughts away and my heart rate didn‚Äôt even go up. it was amazing. 

on the second day, i went grocery shopping. the previous 10 or 15 trips had been increasingly stressful to the point where i‚Äôd leave without everything i needed and i‚Äôd be sweating from anxiety. i used to need to recover from a trip to the grocery store bc the anxiety was mentally draining. not anymore. it was so easy. 

all that to say i‚Äôve had a great experience with it, and i wish you luck."

CPTSD,f4u58at,t3_dlsd1g,1571799445.0,"Honestly, I struggled with the same thing for a long time. Now I‚Äôm in a place where I can say no, but not to someone I have a relationship with, or someone who I might still want to be physical with in the future but just not right now.

Practice helps. Maybe try out different ways to say no, stop, I don‚Äôt want to, etc in a mirror, and try to say them firmly. You‚Äôll almost definitely feel silly at first lol but it‚Äôs an idea, and you‚Äôll at least have a script in your head, should you ever need it."

I agree with everything else you‚Äôre saying though, and really hope OP moves on into a much better situation with much better people around her."
CPTSD,f4u3elq,t1_f4t89zt,1571798131.0,"honestly dude, i think that‚Äôs pretty bad advice. being present makes you aware of how bad your symptoms actually are, so that you can then deal with them and start healing. if you are never taking a moment to be mindful, you‚Äôre always disconnected from your body and your emotions. you‚Äôre running on autopilot based on defense mechanisms and maladaptive ways of reacting to life, based on what you‚Äôve been through in the past. if you never check in and get grounded in the present moment, you never realize how shitty you‚Äôre actually feeling. and you will never get better. it just brings awareness of whatever is already going on within you, that‚Äôs not the same thing as making your symptoms worse."
ptsd,f4u2h0n,t1_f4u1b62,1571797452.0,"I don‚Äôt know, I think the average mentally healthy girl in a normal, healthy relationship wouldn‚Äôt do all that just to defend her boyfriend, especially on the topic of him maybe having raped someone she knows. That‚Äôs a really weird amount of loyalty. 

It screams ‚Äúemotional manipulation‚Äù to me, and we know the guy has the potential to literally rape people and therefore it‚Äôs not a stretch to say he‚Äôs also an abusive boyfriend who plays mind-games, but hey, your guess is as good as mine."
dating_advice,f4twwyl,t3_dlphdm,1571794651.0,"We all consciously and subconsciously take in messages from society and the media about what features we should and shouldn‚Äôt find attractive. Unfortunately in America, a lot of these messages say dark skin is less desireable, and most people never even think to question their preferences and try to break free of the brainwashing.

Side note, are there not other people of color in your area who could be potential romantic partners? Just white dudes?"
CPTSD,f4twc0w,t1_f4tut29,1571794420.0,"Yikes, three times? I can see why you wouldn‚Äôt feel emotionally safe. Maybe he should do some research since he doesn‚Äôt have firsthand knowledge about all this. Either on PTSD itself and how it works, or how to better be a supportive partner to someone who‚Äôs been through shit. There are plenty of posts and articles I‚Äôve seen, without even really seeking them out, on what not to say to someone with trauma. At a certain point I feel like if you genuinely care and want to be the best partner possible, you should be somewhat pro-active about it. There are tons of resources out there for partners of people with mental health conditions."
CPTSD,f4tpib3,t3_dlouis,1571792160.0,"Have you told him how that response made you feel? If you explain what exactly felt dismissive, and how, I think there‚Äôs a chance you could work to get to a place where you can try again. 

I‚Äôm assuming this is an otherwise positive and healthy relationship, and he cares about you a lot. So I think it‚Äôd be worth trying again. I know it‚Äôs hard, it really does feel impossible to let people in sometimes and one negative interaction can feel like confirmation that you should never ever open up again, but people can surprise you.

If he loves you I‚Äôm sure he wants to understand you and know what‚Äôs going on in your mind so that he can care for you better. You‚Äôre allowed to talk about all of your issues if you feel comfortable doing so. You don‚Äôt have to pick and choose, there‚Äôs no limits other than your boundaries and his listening capacity."
CPTSD,f4szx2w,t3_dlmxyf,1571782547.0,"That sounds traumatic to me, and definitely not normal-family stuff, but regardless, this is subjective. If you were traumatized, which it seems really likely you were, then you were traumatized. Don‚Äôt worry about whether or not you should have been affected by it, it did affect you, and that‚Äôs done. What now? 

What happened has already happened, and all you can do now is try to heal and grow. To me, your therapist sounds like they‚Äôre good at their job, so hopefully they can assist you and make the process a bit easier. 

Also, you can be lucky in some ways and unlucky in other ways. Life isn‚Äôt so black and white. One can definitely grow up upper middle class and also have been through shit."
CPTSD,f4sxh00,t1_f4seqpl,1571781777.0,"If they do any of that, they clearly don‚Äôt respect your time and mental health in the first place and that should make it even easier to remove them from your life or increase the distance between you two.

If someone attacks you for setting a boundary, that just shows you that you truly did need one. Boundaries are for self-protection, not to punish others. It‚Äôs not your fault or your problem if they take it as a punishment or you trying to be difficult."
ptsd,f4sw6z3,t3_dlmne4,1571781470.0,"My first thought from this girl‚Äôs reaction is, maybe he‚Äôs already done something to her. That would explain the disproportionate reaction. Maybe he‚Äôs messed with her head and now she has the urge to defend him. Either way though, not your problem, definitely cut that girl out your life and try not to dwell on it. You meant well trying to warn her, and someday she‚Äôll probably appreciate that.

Also, a party would not have been a great way to get back into socializing, that sounds so stressful, I‚Äôd recommend some type of simple, small plans with only a few people to get back out there. And have an excuse ready so you can leave early if you need to. It might bring you comfort to have an escape route. 

I‚Äôm so sorry you went through this and I hope your situation gets better soon."

Healthyhooha,f4k0dwb,t3_der52o,1571630994.0,"lube is definitely a great idea, use lots of water-based, good quality lube (sustain naturals is my favorite brand, it‚Äôs mostly aloe vera juice!) and go slowly. like, as slowly as you can stand to. penetration is not supposed to hurt. ideally, you‚Äôre already really aroused by the time any penetration is happening, and that helps your vagina expand and open up, and for most people it also starts to lubricate itself a bit (but for some people that doesn‚Äôt happen, or it‚Äôs not a lot of lubrication, or it simply takes a long time before it starts getting wet on its own. that‚Äôs why lube exists). 

also, if she doesn‚Äôt already, ask her to give you oral first, especially focusing on putting her tongue in/around your actual vagina to get it wet. this + lube has made my sex life a million times better, in my early relationships i just dealt with the pain and it lead to irritation, tiny tears in my vagina and around it, and most importantly a lot of negative psychological effects. sex should feel good. you don‚Äôt want to get to a point where you‚Äôre scared of having sex for fear of it being painful.

please don‚Äôt just suffer through the pain, it‚Äôs completely avoidable, i promise."

Your mom should respect your health choices, it‚Äôs your body and you‚Äôre 18. If you are okay with coughing a bit until the steroids kick in, she should respect that. She probably meant well with having you take the cough syrup, but what she said to you after the appointment was absolutely out of line. 

This boyfriend sounds immature. Wouldn‚Äôt waste any more of my time on him if I were you. From what you‚Äôve written he gaslights you, dismisses your feelings and concerns, doesn‚Äôt make time for you, etc. You deserve better, you deserve someone who listens to you because they care and they want the relationship to work too. 

This friend sounds like they‚Äôre going through some things... I‚Äôd just leave her alone. I wouldn‚Äôt be mean, but I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to be nice to her. Changed behavior without an apology is always suspicious. If she really cared about repairing your friendship after saying hurtful things, she‚Äôd apologize to you. She might just be lonely after destroying all her relationships. You can have empathy for someone without letting them back into your life.

Also, drop your therapist, you‚Äôve been through a lot of potentially traumatic events and a long term emotionally abusive relationship. You need to process things before you can let go of them. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúdwelling.‚Äù That‚Äôs minimizing and dismissing your feelings as well. If you‚Äôre currently having nightmares you need to work with someone who is willing to help you process and heal, you can‚Äôt just get over trauma.

You can‚Äôt read other people‚Äôs minds anyway, so it‚Äôs gonna be a better use of your time trying to figure out your own.

Also, start asking that insecure voice in your head, ‚Äúso what?‚Äù Like, so what if he doesn‚Äôt like you anymore? You‚Äôll be sad at first, but then you‚Äôll move on, and you‚Äôre still always going to be worthy of love. The idea is that if you get realistic for a minute about your current crisis you‚Äôll realize a lot of these things, though the anxiety you feel at the moment is very real, you will recover from and be just fine.

If you have the right kind of relationships in your life, and they know that you struggle with this, they should be actively trying not to make you feel like a burden. There are compassionate, understanding people out there who will do their best to never make you feel that way again.

You deserve to have your needs met. Ask yourself, what planted the idea in your mind that you weren‚Äôt worthy of that? Once you remember what it was and unlearn this false belief it should be easier. You are allowed to need, want, and ask for things, just like everyone else."
