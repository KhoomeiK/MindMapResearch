AskReddit,ey40cy1,t3_cv7nkl,1566778488.0,Hands. I think they need an upgrade. Maybe make them a little sturdier.
depression,ey406u6,t3_cvg56d,1566778360.0,"That's fucked up. If she was really your friend she would have turned them away and focused on you. I can understand if she was upset, but that was no reason to hit you, let alone insult you. I don't mean to insult your friend, but she should have handled it better. You needed support, and she was of no help. It may seem strange and not help all that much, but I think you are a wonderful person. No matter what happens, please remember that you have my distant support."
depression,ey3z8nq,t3_cvg884,1566777641.0,"Well, I have an idea but it's just an idea.

I like to believe everyone's afterlife will be how they imagine it to be. For me it's a movie theater packed with all my previous incarnations. And we watch the previous me's life and just talk about stuff while we wait for the next me to be born. (new incarnation)

And I kinda understand why you are uncertain about what awaits in the afterlife, because nobody knows for sure. It's all just speculation and theories. I hoped answered your question well enough."
depression,ey3wb79,t3_cvdly9,1566775415.0,"I can relate and sometimes it helps a little. Just to scream. To get something out. If that makes sense. And please don't ever feel like your thoughts and feelings aren't valid. If your friends and family are really that, they'll listen. And if not you've always got reddit. Not exactly the best, but it's something, right? Just know you have my distant support. Whatever it's worth."

depression,ey025nv,t3_cuorzz,1566673349.0,"Yeah I need at least a little backround noise or I cant get to sleep. Usually I listen to music or have a fan running. One time I couldn't because my phine was dead, and I laid there for hours just thinking. And for me to think for an extended length of time ain't healthy."
depression,ey00kn0,t3_cpidz8,1566672727.0,"I can relate to this. They say home is where your heart is, but what if you lost your heart? Do you just have no home? As someone struggling with the day-to-day of depression I sincerely hope you don't have to go through anything I've gone through. And I hope you find happiness, no matter how insignificant it may seem to others."
