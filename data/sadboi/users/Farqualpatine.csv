What’s worse, my jaw is still the size of a child’s jaw, so I look like the most pathetic excuse of a creature unless I jut my lower jaw forward as much as possible, giving me an average appearance at the expense of tension which gives me headaches and sometimes migraines.
If my dental work in the future works out as I think it will, the only way for my jaw to align is to have a slight underbite like most people. My eyes will always be sunken, fleshy bags because the don’t have the support under them that everyone else has.
Nobody in my family can really grow facial hair. I’m also a husky person with naturally a lot of muscle which is actually a huge detriment to my looks as it makes my jaw look even smaller.

Here in America you have to be prepared to get good training in a short time as the best spots are often private property, but the silver lining is that it removes chance for hesitation.

I feel you on ignoring spectators. It’s why it’s far easier to go to jams than it is to solo train. I’d say that having a strong identity as a disciple of parkour is a good mindset to ignore the fear of others opinions. Most people don’t really care that much, it’s just pretty interesting from a non parkour perspective to see people move the way we do.

Generally I just keep a chill, easygoing attitude. I respect security and cops and leave with courtesy when asked. I encourage curious investigators to try some things out, offer to show some basics, etc.
