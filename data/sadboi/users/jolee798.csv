bipolar2,eqvvi3t,t1_eqv0yic,1560350166.0,"I feel this way often. I’ll achieve something great, but when my depression comes around it’s like it doesn’t even matter anyway. I feel like I’m only achieving because I have to in order to stay somewhat stable. I don’t want to harm myself even though I think about it often. I’ve pushed myself to try to find meaning in the world and in every aspect of my life, but I always come up with nothing. Tbh I’ve found myself living for my parents and that’s about it. They have supported me through my disorder and everything else. They have invested so much time and love in me that I would feel guilty if I didn’t try. They have been my best friends when I pushed everyone else away. If they were not around then I would have no reason to keep moving forward."
