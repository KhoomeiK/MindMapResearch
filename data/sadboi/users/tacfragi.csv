„My small waist... huge breasts...“ - it sucks. 
I wouldn’t mind if someone has a small dick, and height doesn’t determine if someone’s attractive or not IMO. It’s about power and control and you can have that with a small penis/when you’re not 6ft. Even without rape, I’m attracted to a person wether or not they have x measurements. I don’t think rape is about having a giant cock. In movies/texts and stuff most things -almost everything’s actually- are so overdone imo, it takes the fun away. I, again, that’s a preference, but would rather read something where the guy is average or smth than where he has like a giant cock, is 6‘2 and stuff."

AMA,fkyodt9,t1_fkye7m6,1584652796.0,"Also, what about differential diagnosis / comorbility with borderline personality disorder? What you’re describing reminds me of it. 
I myself have BPD so I guess I can relate more than the average to your illness. I’m so sorry people invalidate and hold prejudice against your illness. I know what it’s like, people suddenly becoming psychology experts telling you stuff that’s just not true. The stigma is hard to break, especially if people remain arrogant know-it-All‘s. IMO the issue isn’t that people don’t know about mental illness; it’s that they judge it/hold prejudice against it and even brazenly assume they are right even though they don’t know shit. It makes me so fucking angry. TW Self harm: once I asked a guy if he knew what borderline was (since he didn’t have it) and he said yes and showed me his arm where he supposedly had scratching his exes name into. He thought borderline equals self harm. Someone told me all borderlines are dangerous. Wtf is wrong with people. I don’t go to cardiologist and tell them about how the heart works neither. 
Its okay to not understand /know about something. Just don’t fucking tell people you knew better. Same with homophobes and transphobes"
AMA,fkymj8a,t1_fkye7m6,1584651712.0,"Wow, thank you SO much for your detailed answer. I understand DID a lot better now!

What’s your trauma? What do you think about people saying that people with DID are incalculable? What are your symptoms? Have you been to a clinic before? How and when did it develop? Have you different altars, if yes, how many? Who are they? Are you aware/conscious when they switch and about what they say? Is there a „main“ altar? When were you diagnosed? What helps you in recovery and what triggers you? Do you have a support system? What does your typical day look like? What do you hate lost about DID? Us there something you like about it?"

AMA,fky9ct1,t1_fkx6dyj,1584644224.0,"It’s very hard. Bpd is seen as the most emotionally painful mental disorder. Sometimes I feel happy and then I feel incredibly sad. I also said this in another comment, it’s said that a crisis for borderlines feels as awful as the death of a loved one for a healthy person. 
A crisis can be anything. A slight trigger or a big one, fe. I once couldn’t start the washing machine and started crying. Most borderlines are often under tension, everything stresses them, hence many self harm, like cutting, and you get a lot of stares for your scars. That’s the weird looks I get, also crying in public get you weird looks lol. Most people don’t understand; which isn’t their fault and it’s okay. The most important thing is to not judge someone (with an invisible illness) because you don’t know how they feel and what they’re going through.  
I haven’t been bullied but I almost all people I know with ADHD have been bullied in school because they are impulsive and are sometimes viewed as „annoying“ and disrespectful. They tend to say stuff and then realise that they didn’t mean to say it, like thinking out loud I guess? People might think it is offensive or insensitive when in fact people with ADHD don’t want to do that. Also, they distract other kids in school and can’t concentrate. It’s hard being a child with ADHD, diagnosed or undiagnosed; most people know it exists but don’t know about the huge emotional impact it has on a child and how their self esteem is suffering from it. The comorbidity with depression, addiction and personality disorders is VERY high."

And seroquel for sleeping!"
AMA,fky7xvc,t1_fkwbfgo,1584643415.0,"It mostly affects my relationship, I constantly idealise and devaluate people I meet. I don’t have my emotions under control, my mood changes from hour to hour and something slightly upsetting like dropping a tomato on the floor can trigger a huge response. I’ve heard of a comparison: a crisis from a person with borderline (even over something minor) feels like a healthy person feels when someone you love dies. you’re incredibly sad, for a borderline it can last seconds or days.
Also, Theres an intense fear of abandonment and things like a friend cancelling plans can easily trigger a major crisis. A break up makes you feel suicidal and worthless.
The funny, more like ironic thing is that most borderlines are often aware that their feelings aren’t „normal“/healthy, that the tomato falling down isn’t the end of the world; they just can’t help feeling awful that „everything is going wrong“. You might devaluate yourself and everything over something like that, „I’m worthless, *everything* always goes wrong, I can’t do this anymore/...“

I hope this helps get a glimpse into the mind of a person with bpd"
