depression,f50rrtx,t3_dmfjk3,1571931907.0,"I can't speak for others, but for myself, I hate myself so much I can't let people get close or I run away if I think they are. I need to learn to accept myself before I can let anyone love me. It's difficult because I want to love and be with someone, share things I enjoy, get out and do things with someone or even just cuddle at home and watch movies or anime. Hang in there and just try to get out and meet/spend time with people, hopefully you'll eventually find someone or they'll find you."

depression,f4huhwl,t3_dkhgj9,1571596277.0,"I can relate 100%. I just want someone I can trust who wants to spend time with me, shares similar interests, and will accept me for me.  I never feel good enough and struggle with shame and body issues so it's hard to put myself out there. Like you, sex isn't the priority for me, it's finding a connection."
amiugly,f4htqsj,t3_dkdthw,1571596009.0,"You most certainly aren't ugly and lots of people have and will go through high school without dating or kissing. Just try to be yourself and eventually you'll meet someone. As they say, it'll happen when you least expect it."
