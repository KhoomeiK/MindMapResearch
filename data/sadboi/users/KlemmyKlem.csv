CBDOilReviews,ezustgq,t1_ezuazka,1568160150.0,Unfortunately I don’t have anything to give you other than my personal experience. I use the cbd flower or Keif hash when I get a panic attack and it helps to get back to nearly normal much faster. I also smoke in the mornings occasionally just as some extra brain degreasing.
CBDOilReviews,ezkmbi9,t3_d14km1,1567962762.0,"For panic attacks I like to smoke a pre rolled joint, otherwise I use a vape cart if I don’t want the attention from the smell or the tincture because the time it takes to go into effect is small compared to eating a jelly. I work for a cbd company to I have the luxury of testing out the different methods that work for me"
