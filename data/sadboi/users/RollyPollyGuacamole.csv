Did he abuse stimulants, or something else (I ask since stimulants are often known to cause substance induced delusions/paranoia/etc)?

I don't think the coordinator realizes this about the volunteer, and I don't think she's a bad volunteer, I think she is just overwhelmed with the squirrels she has and was pretty much begging us without saying it to keep him longer.

Your reply was the push I needed to make the 100% decision to start working as hard as we can to find a different volunteer through the coordinator that has squirrels more near his age. We are trying to get this done TODAY. 

Thank you for your kind and patient response. We are very new to this and have inevitably become attached to him in the two weeks we've had him and nursed him back to health, so this is all very overwhelming and we are still sorting out what is best to do and not to do. We were always planning on giving him to another rehabber to do a soft release as he is strong and healthy and we do not currently have the space to do soft releases, but your post made me really realize that we need to get him with other squirrels like, NOW. 

Thank you so much, again, for your patience and wisdom. We will still be investing in a couple of cages to be able to volunteer in the near future once we are better set up, because we found out that there are a lot of people that only take them for certain stages and then move them along to the outdoor enclosures that somebody else has, but now is not the time for that. What's best for him is to be with other squirrels and today is (hopefully) the day we will lovingly let him go to be with a different rehabber so that he can be around his kind until he's ready to be released. I think he thinks he is a tiny human and we can't have that! 

We have also admittedly messed up when it comes to giving him way too many loves and snuggles and pets. Being our first time, we weren't able to keep the ""aw how freaking adorable"" separate as we were learning and the longer we keep him the more attached he will be. We know that's not best for him. He shouldn't trust humans that much. I just wanted to add this so that nobody reading this worries- we have learned from this mistake and understand that, going forward, we need to keep more detachment from our fosters. I have confidence that because he was only with us for two weeks this will be an easy adjustment for him once he's with some squirrel friends and a rehabber that will not smother him with too much human contact."

>Ive been depressed before and its not that.

There are many different symptoms of depression. I have many different 'types' of depression I go through. By that I mean that one bout of depression may feel completely different than another bout of it. I will get depressed one month and feel the overwhelming sadness and despair, the homesickness and loneliness. But then my next bout of depression may be me feeling apathetic with terrible brain fog and forgetfulness, but lacking the 'sadness'. 

I really feel like you are just going through depression that does not feel that same as it did in the past, and you may not be realizing that it still is depression but with different symptoms.

Obviously I cannot diagnose you, especially through the internet, and I am not a professional. I urge you to seek out a therapist and/or a psychiatrist and then take it from there. I hope you can take steps toward helping yourself and getting this under control.

I am an atheist so I don't pray, but I do have my own way of praying, sort of. I will keep you in my thoughts and pray for you in my own way. I wish you the best. Asking for help is a very brave and very wonderful thing to do, and I know you can find the courage within you to do so. <3"

I don't see this habit of mine changing ANY time soon at all, if ever. Just wanted to add some personal perspective on this part of it. I also don't live in or come from the midwest. I wanted to point that out too just in case that matters."
relationships,fkj1atk,t1_fjccvc7,1584233653.0,"I agree. I have definitely heard young man/woman said in a good way, but far less often than in a negative way. 

Also I'm 12 days late but I just wanted to respond to something as an excuse to tell you, OP u/FinalConnection1, how much this post made me smile and warmed my heart. Especially given your age, you're a great young man (hah, sorry.. just joking there). Really though- It's freaking awesome that you have taken the time to reflect on this and you sound like a great human, which is something the world needs more of. <3

I also think you should apologize if you see her again, but don't fret about it too much if you don't get the chance to. She's probably forgotten about it by now."
relationships,fkiz640,t1_fke38wt,1584232123.0,"There's a great quote to go alone with the advice that u/BrokenPaw just gave you- ""Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.""

Also, if it helps, you can (and absolutely have every right to) cut him out of your life and then let him back into your life in the future IF you would like to once (and if) he knocks off his shitty behavior. I've had to do this with a few people.

In regards to what you just posted, you can't let him emotionally extort you like that. I know you didn't say he's threatening to do that, so essentially you're emotionally extorting yourself with the fear of it.. and I totally get why you'd be afraid of such a thing! It's scary, but you can't let fear hold you back. You need to live your life. He may tell people these things, he may not. But you can't let that dictate how you live and whether you let him continue to treat you like shit or cut him out."
relationships,fkixzp4,t1_fkgl6ff,1584231323.0,"Wow, yeah... ""Sometimes when my boyfriend ~~apologizes~~ pretends to apologize when in reality he turns it around on me..."" FTFY. My boyfriend has issues with apologizing too. Not in the same way, but in a way where he just doesn't apologize and tries to wait for or get things to go back to normal. I know he's not malicious about it and I have brought it up to him a few times. I'd be furious if he was A) being malicious for sure (he just has trouble apologizing outright)  B) not working on it at all and C) inclined to get super defensive when I talk to him about it... but, he luckily doesn't do any of those things I listed so it's not as big a deal as it could be. Sorry your boyfriend has apology issues too! I know how it feels.."

You may want to think that over... It could possibly be that you just post a lot, no big deal, but on the other hand it could be a major warning sign."

Don't try to fix things by using a relationship to fix them... if that makes sense? I didn't mean that wanting to stay together is emotionally immature, I just mean that .. you know when people try to have a kid together to 'save a relationship'? It doesn't work like that. I know that's not what's going on, it was just an example. It just seems like you are trying to use a relationship to fix each others own individual issues which isn't going to work.

It does sound like her idea from what was written, but who knows, really."

I'm probably very wrong and didn't read enough, but either way, I just realized this girl was supposedly there for NINE days when she was found. That seems like plenty of time. Also, I posted the video of her being found in another comment and it looks as if she was intentionally tucked in. The bed was all neat, and so it looked as if somebody had made it with her body in there. This is all seeming very suspicious."
