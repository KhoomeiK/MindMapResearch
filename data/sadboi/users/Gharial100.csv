TwoXChromosomes,fo9ss0v,t1_fo93wcj,1587629880.0,"If they said “ok boomer” that doesn’t necessarily mean they think you’re a boomer. Also, being a boomer is more than just being a baby boomer in age, it’s also a state of mind (that state being a homophobe/transphobe/racist/misogynist/a general arsehole), meaning we can call practically anyone horrible a boomer. Although in that case, it just sounds like they were making the (seriously overused) ok boomer joke that everyone else my age seemed to love to make (thankfully I heard the joke after it was trendy because my country is a bit late with trends and jokes and memes)"

teenagers,fjpc1zd,t1_fjpbonr,1583546963.0,"True, according to the death vs recovered ratio it’s approximately 6% but it’ll probably drop now they’ve figured out how to prevent/treat it, it won’t be good if it keeps spreading and hospitals fill up though.

2. Jokingly saying I’m mentally challenged (is that the correct term?) made my depression and self harm issues worse. But hey, it’s just a joke… right? 
3. Bonus: they implied (but didn’t outright say) that me and my siblings sharing our issues (depression, anxiety, etc) was taking a mental toll on our parents and it was our faults that we had those issues. Yeah, that stopped me from sharing anything else. 
So yeah, cheers mum and dad"
