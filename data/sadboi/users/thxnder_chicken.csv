prochoice,fnac565,t3_fw9om9,1586794896.0,"My mom got married at 16 and over the years brought 3 children into the world. My dad already had 4 other kids. And she complained about how she didn‚Äôt get to be young (it was her choice to get married at 16) because she had to take care of my dads kids. And once she was able to go out and party (drink, 21) she was pregnant with HER first baby. She still to this day claims the reason she went to a meth head man and got us out in foster care was because she didn‚Äôt get to be young. She‚Äôs still pro life funny enough. I didn‚Äôt ask to grow up with an absent mother. I didn‚Äôt ask to grow up in a crack house. I didn‚Äôt ask to grow up in foster care and neither does any other baby that‚Äôs brought into this world on the grounds of pro life."
