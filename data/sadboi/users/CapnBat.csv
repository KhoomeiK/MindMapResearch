The Duluth model is predicated around women because the statistics show that domestic violence is overwhelmingly performed on women by men. This is actually predicated on the ancient idea of ‚Äúchivalry‚Äù which glorifies women as fragile trophies, therefore dehumanizing them and taking their perception of agency. Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúhow does treating women well equate to rape?‚Äù Great question, stupid, allow me to elaborate. Baking into your culture for hundreds of years that women are defenseless will suggest to some men that without a man, women are vulnerable to rape, and as less than men, some would even believe they had the right to put their dicks wherever they wanted. This is not all men, this isn‚Äôt even you, necessarily, but it IS where that principle came from. 

There aren‚Äôt billionaires in congress because billionaires have better things to do, therefore they just pay congress to uphold their interests via campaign donations. You are not making the case for your own intelligence with that question."

Yes. I am making the argument that because this group was ineffective they don‚Äôt matter. Groups who‚Äôs ideas actually have merit and traction inevitably attract followers and donors, leading to real change. These are the steps we‚Äôve seen taken repeatedly, not just in women‚Äôs rights, but in civil rights, abortion rights, gun rights, and even religious rights. Therefore when we‚Äôre talking about democracy, if your group is ineffective, your group doesn‚Äôt matter. 

I think this is a much more valid argument then saying ‚Äúhey women who are dead now agreed with me when they were alive!‚Äù Which is basically your argument.

It‚Äôs not that my points are shifting, I just constantly have to continue establishing context because you have no concept of how history power dynamics work and I‚Äôm used to debating with more intelligent people. I‚Äôm happy to keep breaking things down as you need though."

Just because a small, ineffective interest group from 80 years ago supports your point of view now does not validate it. Actually it does the reverse. The fact that this group no longer exists AND had almost no success while they were active PROVES your ideas are antiquated. 

Find a more noble cause to fight for."

‚ÄúMembers of the NAOWS typically belonged to wealthy families who feared suffrage would upset the status quo.[11] In the South, the NAOWS gained support from many plantation owners who believed rights for women would lead to rights for minorities.‚Äù

Your own article admits that this interest group had alterior motives for preserving the status quo. Now who‚Äôs the moron?

Also I think it‚Äôs worth noting that nowhere on this page does it mention any legislative victories AND that this organization is no longer in existence.

MensRights,ex3sc9d,t1_ex3rdfs,1565990606.0,"Yeah you‚Äôre right, men just had to be white, landowning males. That TOTALLY undermines my claim of systematic gender suppression. Yup, men have definitely fought for equal rights for generations, and none of your logic is conflating LOSS of power with LACK of power. That was sarcasm Incase you illiterates can‚Äôt wrap your mind around it. Power is rival by nature, meaning the more of it you give to other groups the less the first has. While this resembles oppression in the sense that you don‚Äôt have as many freedoms as you did before, really those freedoms you‚Äôre losing are revolving around your entitlement and/dominance over other genders and/or races, therefore your argument is nonsense. 

Also women want to be a part of the military, dumbass. That‚Äôs why there ARE women in the military, so your bullshit claim about the draft is also bullshit. You know who worried about not including women in the draft? Men! Men were in charge and viewed women as less capable (or incapable) of combat. Therefore there wasn‚Äôt a chance in hell they‚Äôd allow women to serve, despite the pressure to let them vote. Congratulations you‚Äôve just owned yourself."
MensRights,ex3qk7b,t1_ex3itpr,1565989653.0,"A lot of ground to cover here so I‚Äôll try to stay organized. 

-do you know why the baby boomers got that name? Because when all the WWII vets arrived at home they almost immediately ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù with their wives, thus creating a generation almost overnight, hence a BOOM of BABIES shortly after the war. Similarly, as all those vets returned en mass, they were expected to inherit the jobs they had before they left, naturally at the expense of the ladyfolk. 

-women DO seek those dirty jobs, but there are several factors behind why there are less of them than men. One is gender determination, or the idea that men should have ‚Äúmasculine jobs‚Äù and women should have ‚Äúfeminine jobs‚Äù, which is exactly the kind of thing feminists are seeking to undo. We can see this bias on both sides of the interview desk, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. There‚Äôs also the economic aspect that when we hire women we expect them to eventually take a maternity leave, which factors into the pay disparity. I could also make the case that women get gender studies degrees so they can prove to idiots like you unequivocally how capable they can be. 

I‚Äôve seen women do 40 pull-ups. I‚Äôve had women win against me in debates and job interviews. I‚Äôve had women jump off cliffs before I had the nerve to. If you‚Äôre looking for it, the proof is all around you. Instead, you prefer to classify yourself as an underdog and therefore select or invent evidence that supports your worldview. That does not make it real. Study history, economics, anthropology, and even empathy deeply and the conclusion is inescapable. Unfortunately I have seen little evidence from your arguments that you have anything more than a passing familiarity with any of these 4 categories. You continue to question and rant, but none of your claims are backed up by any data or examples and I find no credibility in that. Sorry dude. Gotta read to succeed."
MensRights,ex3gb32,t1_ex3esk4,1565985087.0,"Lmao that answer betrays how self-centered your outlook is. ‚ÄúMen have spent thousands of years protecting and taking care of fragile women and children and they should be grateful.‚Äù How about the point of view that in many cases women were just as capable of doing those same jobs. Want proof? How about in WW11 when the majority of able-bodied men were fighting overseas, so women stepped up and nearly single-handedly sustained the American economy, including manufacturing the guns, bullets, and bombs the men were using to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the homeland? 

Also what do you mean by ‚Äúwomen have had protections?‚Äù Protected from the right to vote? Protected from the right to serve in the military? Protected from owning property? It‚Äôs a little confusing. If, however you mean the social programs designed to ensure women and minorities are not discriminated against by applying for jobs, I‚Äôd remind you that there were plenty of idiots defending ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights‚Äù in the 60‚Äôs as they lined up to prevent women‚Äôs sufferage.

If you‚Äôre going to accuse my ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù of not being real, you best come prepared with actual examples. I find your hypothetical nonsense amusing, but unconvincing."
MensRights,ex3cusu,t1_ex2gley,1565983586.0,"1) Literally no one  has asked you to stand up and renounce your manhood in solidarity. People don‚Äôt generally don‚Äôt draw those commonalities among dominant gender and ethnic groups. That‚Äôs one of the perks of BEING dominant in a culture. Any of this you are seeing is likely your own insecurity, only you‚Äôre reaching if you‚Äôre justifying your underdog status on your gender. Men have predominantly dominated over women on a cultural and societal level for 6000 years. Look it up. Therefore I would suggest that you reevaluate the premise on your identity on something more...real. 

2) Merriman-Webster describes masculine as ‚Äúhaving qualities appropriate to or usually associated with a man.‚Äù I would challenge that this definition could mean literally anything we think. Now, in the vernacular this tends to be associated with stoicism or emotional distance and dominance by way of aggressiveness. I would argue that emotionally connecting with people around us, and while dominating when we have to, relinquishing the stage when it‚Äôs appropriate can be a powerful asset as well. 

Basically I‚Äôm saying your point of view is hollow and not based on anything real."

You have to train yourself to hold your skeletal structure in ways that can bear more weight without putting strain on it and your tendons.
