SkincareAddiction,fckfabv,t3_ehj9ok,1577724032.0,"I'm using various Nip + Fab ones (needle fix, bee sting) which seem good tbh but I am also in the market for better ones.

I do love Cerave products as they're recommended by dermatologists so perhaps try their eye cream? [here](https://www.cerave.co.uk/our-products/moisturisers/eye-repair-cream).

And also make sure to lightly press round the eye with your ring finger (as this has the least power) if you aren't already of course. Best of luck!"
SkincareAddiction,fckel0e,t3_ehkpgg,1577723584.0,"Cleanser, SPF, and moisturiser is a good basis to moisturise your skin and help oiliness before you go into acids and stuff. 

I highly recommend Cerave as it's dermatologist recommended and pretty cheap for what you get. And they do an AM moisturiser with SPF. Another good one is look out for deals on Laroche posay cleansers and SPF as these can be a little more expensive. 

Would go for a simple routine:

Am: cleanse, SPF
Pm : cleanser, moisturise

Cerave's washes and moisturisers also have ceramides and niocinamide which are incredible at restoring the skin barrier.

If you wanted to go into acids once you skin is better, look into other posts for The Ordinary and Drunk Elephant brands and always keep an eye out for other redditors with a similar skin type and their routines as this page is full of great honest reviews!

Good luck!"
