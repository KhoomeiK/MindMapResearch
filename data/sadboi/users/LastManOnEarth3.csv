-Your phone and earbuds aren’t worn weight.

-Your electronics look good, but I’d recommend reading books on your phone. If not, that’s cool, everyone’s got a luxury :)

-Trowel, towel, razer, are unecessary. FAK sounds excessive. I personally bring contacts or glasses, not both. Bug spray sounds okay, but you can buy pure deet cheaply that’s lighter. Sunblock is unnecessary with the right clothing choices. This last point said, I am Asian, so YMMV.

-I personally don’t cook, you could save a lot here, especially in TPW, which is what really matters. You don’t need to cold soak (I don’t) just get comfortable with tortillas. 

-Bleach is lighter. You probably want an OPSAK for bears. I don’t think 

-A half z-lite is lighter and IMO more comfy. YMMV.

-Your clothes are a huge room for weight savings. I see at least a pound to be saved here. Get rid of the hiking shirt and wear the baselayer as your only shirt. There’s never a good reason to have two shirts. Ditch the baselayer bottoms. Use windpants if you need warmth.

Silpoly is easy to come buy and damned cheap. Follow some guides and you’ll have yourself a sweet shelter in no time.

Your tarp is a big place for weight savings. DCF is expensive, but silpoly isn’t and you could definitely get a tarp for a fraction of the weight your tarp rocks. 

This might be unpopular, but you could shave some weight by ditching the stove, but a 9-lb baseweight should be achievable sans stove.

As others have said the pack isn’t the best, but if you don’t want to replace it since it’s new that’s cool too.

Could you edit your lighterpack to include your clothes? Without all your clothes listed this is pretty inaccurate. Your non-worn clothing for a 3-4 season set up should include a puffy, fleece, wind pants, thermal pants, beanie, rain jacket, and gloves. 

Your top quilt might be too much. Especially with synthetic. You could get away with a similarly priced (synthetic!) Spirit 28* quilt from Mountain Laurel Designs.

Edit: Based off this post I’m going to assume you don’t know where to get regular weed either. In which case just go to Dinky, give the homeless guys outside TCF a dollar and then ask them where you can find some.

Edit 2: Please don’t do the above. I do it on occasion when I’m looking for the hard stuff but it really isn’t a safe option and should only be used in times of serious desparation."

Ocala is beautiful. It’s a hike, it can’t really be that awful. But the sun exposure, the lack of clean water outside of spigots starting after Big Cypress and going on till past Okeechobee... I’m just saying that if I had to recommend a hike, and just one hike, the FT goes way down on the list. Bringing a skateboard of course would completely change the above."

If you want lower price and same functionality, get a synthetic, but you’ll pay in weight. You can have two of: light, cheap, and quality when it comes to anything down. I’ll leave it to you to pick which two."
