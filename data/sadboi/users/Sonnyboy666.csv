With Covid19, patients are able to be offered medication by only a phone call with a doctor, most of the time taken care of by insurance 100. For those who are actually trying to stay off opiates with medicinal help, this is an enormously helpful resource."

Yes, things are different and difficult. But I have to see the clinician once a week and im hopeful that I can beat all this. I have ptsd also. So im still a mess, but im not getting high. Anyways thanks again for your post, and your service."

heroin,fey47e8,t1_fbvsccr,1579440634.0,"Yea I hear that. Every time I rapid taper I last two days after the subs and im back getting high. So im looking into a six to nine month taper. And hit NA for something to do thats somewhat proactive. Subs would chill me out on drinking too. Ive heard of this long taper working, but its just putting off that day where i just kick and its physically done. I'm thinking of the safety net that I won't be able to get as high if I used. So I can just fucking live not using. But I went to that clinic and started on a Friday so I got the take home, and lost a weekend to near full-blown withdrawals and started getting high Monday. looking back I should've timed that appointment with the day I got out of detox. I'd actually rather see if my PCP will write a month script. This detox center told me the last time I went in two weeks ago that that was it. No more stays unless I show a real change. I'm going to tell them I needed a real plan. This shit just dawned on me. Thought I'd share. If you read this and been through this what do you think because I can't keep using and fucking everything off all the time. But I can't stop."
AskMen,fel41cg,t3_epfb2w,1579213594.0,"I fell for a chick and she had expressed reciprocated feelings. She was the first to drop an I love you, and our relationship carried on that way. So naturally, when people are in love, they share who they are and what they are about. So, we had met in alcoholics anonymous, her being a drunk who tried drugs or whatever, and I was a full blown junkie getting my recovery from alcoholics because thats where I ended up. I always respected the meetings by not talking about drugs as I was instructed. And it worked for me. So, we start pillow talking or whatever and I let her know what ended me up in the meetings and she straight up ghosted me. Thats when I learned what ghosting was. And it hurt to say the least. She eventually spoke to me about it and we were able to be civil. But it hurt like hell and that was the coldest love I had ever experienced."

heroin,fel2paf,t1_fbvto14,1579212767.0,Thanks for the replies. Ive since cut my habit down to twenty vents a day and still tapperring. My best friend has reccomended xan and/or ghb to get through the first couple days of subs. But you're right.. Some time off work is going to be needed and a rapid taper is in my best interest. I tried going to the clinic for subs but that situation was more irritating than dealing with my regular plug. But im trying guys and I'll keep this posted. Thanks again for the feedback.

depression,f8de5vg,t1_f8c4d2q,1574487160.0,"I know this cycle too well, my friend. As someone who has struggled with depression all my life, as well as drug addiction, these cycles are all too common. In the less expensive treatment styles Ive sought, ive been told, anonymously of course, that when those days sneak up on me I need to think about what is triggering this odd mode that I fall into and look at my thoughts as though they are fears. Addressing the fear out loud to myself, followed by positive affirmations within a pep talk (to myself), I am challenged with facing a fear instead of crawling back into bed. I hope this helps friends as I left out the part where I take a hand full of pills whether I go to work or not, so I usually cool off. Besides professional help, I swear that proper sleep, diet, and exercise give me low doses of what the meds give me artificially. Ive just recently bounced back from another month long spell in which I fucked nearly everything up with my problems. I felt like sharing something so thanks for reading. I always tell myself when I get stuck that I am not the only one going through this. It makes me a bit bigger after my disease has made me so small and isolated without me even noticing. We need to give ourselves a break sometimes because we've been through enough, and we deserve it. Cheers"
