DeadBedrooms,ffneufd,t1_ffnehi1,1580065051.0,"I know it sounds wrong ! But i agree, I think if you really care for the other, you might insist him to do it. Ecause you want it to work. Also its part of loving yourself, you dont want to wait on someone who doesnt want to fix a problem for a better relationship.  I know, time is gold. Maybe i will bring a timing lightly."
DeadBedrooms,ffndmko,t1_ffncxye,1580064583.0,I want to see if he is initiative in actually wanting to see what is wrong. But if he does wonder then I will suggest because that can be true. Thank you.
DeadBedrooms,ffnd5go,t1_ffmzxu2,1580064501.0,"This is what I thought of it. It seems like he checks everything else as a good partner, but this would be sad if he really cant make sex a reality and is more into porn than his partner. Like the other comments about him needing counseling, well, I think any person who really wants somethings goes and gets it. If he feels happy or comfortable desensitizing himself or if he is lying about porn then thats him. If it isnt that then I would hope to see him eventually take action to get medical help or initiate things with me. I guess this is just matter of time to see what he does. Thanks."

BPD,fdpvj8m,t3_emjsfy,1578642234.0,"First of all. 
I'm sorry to hear that, it's terrible to have a miscarriage.
2nd, yes after I left a 5 year toxic and abusive relationship, I realized 8/10 it was the other person and they used my bipolar and bpd to blind me to stay and keep using and manipulating. And this even SOUNDS BPD, but after I left everyone actually saw him for what it was. I was left traumatized and having to face the fact that yes I may have a condition but people use that against you to feel better of themselves in any way. And you know re not always the problem, in fact you are not as long if you are consciously working on it and taking responsability."
BPD,fdkhr5l,t3_elm39b,1578504120.0,"Yes. I go from I am the Goddess to
I can't believe I look like this. Then I start to subconciously start to compare myself and that is bad.
On top of loving fashion and being nonbinary, my sense of style has always been different and my looks has seem to always change. So sometimes that trait makes me not know how I look like or really look like.
Sometimes I love thay because I reflect on others, that at times I wonder how easy life is for them to wake up and look the same, and think how awesome it can be to have ranges. 
But yeup, looking at yourself and taking pictures and obsessing a bit too much on everything that is imperfect."

Once I got rejected a few days later AFTER the guy I liked liked me but moved on to like someone else right away. That hurt. Never felt that one before. Of course moved on after 2 weeks I'd like to say."

BPD,fbb54gj,t1_fba8ywu,1576693504.0,"Good for you.
Same here. My current partner is aware and told me, he ignores it , doesn't ignore me, ignores if I start to say things to make him get awaym, because he knows that I am not fully all there and rational, so he waits and ask about any opinions or feelings after. Tells me, I know you actually love me, if I knew you didn't I would've left when you tell me to leave and wouls not consider and understand your differences if I didn't love you."
unpopularopinion,fbb23od,t3_eccckb,1576691684.0,"I agree. I have to cope with bipolar disorder(still figuring out if its 1 or 2), and anxiety, and many ither factirs that branch out. I use to think I was unable for at least 5 years, 17-22 because it would get soo bad, it went side by side with very bad life conditions/circumstances, events..  traumas, ptsd, physical, mental emotional , sexual abuse, poverty, ect. But, after moving away from those, and just dealing with my own mental health issues, I saw that I am pretty capable. There are times I simply cannot, I can get a heavy breakdown, psychosis/schizoaffective disorder, dissociation, suicidal, panic and I take off the day of, or the next day after that from work or school. I dont tell them why, I just call in sick. Even if I dont completely feel great after that day off, I still keep going. Because I all is up onto your willingness . (Mentally sick right lol) But I push foward the next day. You can fall into that 'I cant do it' mentality and stay stuck very easily , more if you've been accustomed that way for quite some time. Its easier. Humans tend to depend on what is easier. Everyone has anxiett, different level, some minimal some to the degree they need meds. Everyone has been depressed, some never again, some need meds bcus it becomed chronic or physiologically they must. I like to advocate for mental health, but because of me, I can say a lot of people pull out that card easily, makes the more moderate to severe cases seem, not real enough. Now ,we all may have periods where we might fall into absolute not being ""able"" to function normally, but it is not permanent! Its not usually an on-going mindset. I know people with schizoprenia, bipolar, etc, its not 24/7, and when it is, you already know those people are in facilities anyways! So, it is up to you, who is in control of your life? A disorder or you? And when it takes control, who takes it back? You or the disorder? Are you YOU or are you the disorder."

I had your experience happen to me twice. It started like a lucid dream then somehow went back to my room. Once was a bad lucid dream, ran back to my room and saw myself sleeping and my dog sleeping and felt dark things trying to open my door, I freaked out and jumped out the window and something told me to go back inside and I kind of fell on top of myself and woke up. Another time. AP /sleep paralysis, had a demon on top of me. I get to see what happens when you have sleep paralysis sometimed woohoo :( everything out of your body is connected."

AskReddit,f375mvj,t3_dfw5c5,1570721731.0,"It was the 2nd week before I finished middle school, I had a spanidh teacher who I liked, fun dude. He was switching to a new classroom and me and other kids were helping him move his stuff. I had 2 textbooks for his class and asked him if I could place them with his books so I can just pick it up when he arranges his books and can just set them aside for me. I think it was a friday and I didnt want to carry books home when we had to turn them in anyways. He was cool about it, I mean no big deal. Fast foward Monday, I had asked for those books and he said he doesn't remember that conversation. Then he said he will look for them. Now, I needed to return those books in order to walk to my graduation and do the school's fun activities for the next 3 days. Well, he didn't ""find"" them, he didn't want to own up to it then turn it against me saying its mybresponsability I shouldn't have gave hin my books. I didn't want my dad to pay for it, got scolded for being irresponsable, talked to the principle and they said just pay it. I didn't get to do the activities and stayed in class those days.

Showerthoughts,f0xnwph,t3_d6wc03,1569039152.0,"When I was around 10 ish I was ""swimming"" in a pool at a Mexican campinh site, people around, not too full. Big pool, big place in the mountains too.  As a 10 year old 5-7 ft edge was deep. I didnt know how to swim and I had no familiar faces around me. Just on my own. Curious.  Anyways for some reason I skimmed through slowly to the deeper side and when my toes no longer felt the floor I kind of just drifted deeper. I panicked and I realized I was in the middle of the deep side of the pool inside. With few feets above my head. When you panic you just get stuck below. Anyways, now the part above memories. I was drowning. After a while of fighting to go up to the surface, you can feel your body give up, you feel pressure , the other details I cannot remember. As I was feeling slow and unable to move. I was aware, my eyes were open and my conciousness was still awake. But not my body. I had this voice , maybe my voice, ""youre dying."" Then with my eyes still open, I couldnt see whats infront of me. Just flashes of memories, I cant recall what but just very rapidly pieces of slides, sounds, voices all crunched up in miliseconds each random memory. The colors were all bright and warm, all oranges, whites, blurs. Nothing like seeing a picture or movie. I dont think I saw my whole life flashed, they deemed to be selective pieces form different times from that age and under.  Just faint blur and just certain colors filled these images. Then I was pulled out by this guy and I started puking water and that was it from that. I dont know what would of happened after, I woukd be obviously dead. I think, maybe you die and the last memory would just be another clip or scene or voice note. Since I couldnt see what was infront of me anymore , but the flashes. Idk, take in a new theory from my experience."
