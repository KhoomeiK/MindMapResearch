Toxic masculinity is only allowing men to be in one state unbreakable rocks who ""protect society"". I believe everyone has to share the load. I'm not a masculine person. I lean androgynous and identify as non-binary.

My main point is I DON'T WANT TO BE FUCKING HIT PERIOD. I grew up around empowered women. My mom was the breadwinner who enforced toxic masculinity on me. My first job was an office of mostly women. It wasn't a bad work environment generally but I was constantly picked on by one of the women who was my superior. My brother's picked on me for not being hypermasculine and my sister and mom enforced that I was a baby for being upset.

Guess who's in therapy out of everyone in my family? Me and only me. And my sister is way more narcissistic than my mom. She gaslights me constantly."

 I think how I looked at it initially was combining all demographics in my local county's stats in LA because I was so paranoid for awhile after I was followed I was afraid to go out.

https://youtu.be/1OeWGMr_tns


He has described [himself as a classical liberal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson) which at face values seems left wing because of what it's named but its essentially in line with Libertarianism. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism 

Anyways I can spend a lot of time on this but theres a sub that checks on his bs and they've collected a bunch of critiques on him from there users. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/wiki/critique 

For example:

- He doesn't think women should be working and that's it actually lowered the value of labor but literally no economists agree.

- He doesn't think gay people should be parents.

- He is a climate change denier. 

- He's worried about ""the family"" unit. 


My personal favorite which isn't on there is he thinks men who are awkward didn't fight enough(he calls it rough and tumble play).

https://youtu.be/u88D8Kj2Xcs 

Hes also described himself as someone who has monetized sjws. There are left wing people who dont like sjw identity politics but there are none that would boast about monetizing sjws because they largely agree with them just not their tactics.
