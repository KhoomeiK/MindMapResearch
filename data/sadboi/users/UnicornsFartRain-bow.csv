I came over to celebrate Eid and her aunt's bridal shower and so many other things and even was gifted proper clothing to wear to events. I loved it so much and if I could choose one culture to actively participate in (because let's be real I'm a shit American and I don't really celebrate the 4th of July or anything) it would be Indian/Bengali culture.
AmItheAsshole,fqw0o8l,t1_fqs1emy,1589689664.0,"So I think I have a unique perspective because I'm undiagnosed but very very likely on the spectrum, yet I've also taught myself how to camouflage in with normal people (for the most part) which means I both completely understand why you said it and I support you in the blunt honesty, but I can see why everyone else is so upset with you. 

It's how you told us that you brought it up that's the issue. It comes across callous and like you would not be upset by a divorce. Many people here think you basically told your wife ""cool well let's divorce"" and that you aren't hurt by that and you don't care if your wife is hurt by that either. 

When you talk with your wife again, you have to remind her of the literal and emotional pain you will experience (and trust me panic attacks are physically painful and draining) if her niece moves in. Remind her of the trauma niece will experience witnessing panic attacks and/or meltdowns from you. Tell your wife how much you care about her and about the well-being of her niece, and ask if she really thinks traumatizing her niece and her husband is better than her niece living with happy loving grandparents who can help heal her existing trauma (there must be some given her parents) without adding to it. 

I have a hard time with being emotionally open with people in terms of using my words. It's hard for me to say ""I love you"" in a serious way or to explain to people how much they mean to me. I don't know if that's the case for you too, but if it is I think now is the time to put in the work to communicate your love for your wife to her. It's also the time to explain to her, in detail, how you will hurt if niece comes to live with you because I'm not sure she really understands the depth of damage done to you by being around kids. But above all, bring it back to the fact that you love your wife and you don't want to lose her but you don't have any other option to take care of yourself if she chooses to take in her niece."

It also can (but does not always) point to the existence of a fetish or some kind of sexual benefit received by the man when he only is okay with his girlfriend sleeping around with women, and being on the outside of that it can feel worrisomely predatory in a way that you can be used for fantasies and stories from the gf without your consent.

Idk I'm still figuring it out) poly woman I feel like that phrase disregards my entire understanding of my own sexuality. The connection I have with men and women is completely different, and being in a committed relationship with a man does not make me feel less like there is another side of me that needs to be fulfilled any more than being in a committed relationship with a woman would. There are things I get (both emotional and physical) being with a man, and things I get being with a woman, and those are not all the same things. Going to a guy and saying ""you have qualities my female partner doesn't but that I desire"" would be just as accurate for me, so I swear this isn't a case of me fetishizing wlw relationships. 

Please don't be angry or hateful towards people like me who do honestly feel like women provide ""something [their] man can't"" but  don't mean it in a way that dehumanizes or objectifies other wlw. I know that straight couples looking for unicorns has probably hurt and thus jaded you, but there are actual people who feel like having men and women in their life is what makes them whole and that's okay. 

I can tell you are saying it to protect yourself, but what about people like me who then feel shitty for thinking that way?

I don't want to tear you down for explicitly stating your boundaries and what you are looking for. I think it's commendable that you know exactly what you're looking for and that you have the balls to just flat out state it without any exceptions. They're also completely reasonable boundaries to have. I just worry that you've lost sight of the fact that people exist who don't fit what you're looking for but also aren't looking to hurt you or use you as some sort of sexual or romantic plaything.

I was told that wearing masks can does not decrease touching of your own face around your eyes/cheeks because you feel safe in the mask and the false sense of safety makes you lower your guard. So people feel safer with the masks on and don't realize they are still touching their face (maybe even more than usual i.e. to adjust the way the mask sits). 

I've also been told that unless the mask is airtight against someone's face, it doesn't prevent the spread of virus/bacteria because the microbes can escape through the sides of the mask into the air and people don't cover their mouth like they should due to thinking the mask is doing it for them. 

I agree with you that it can be a clear sign of ""stay away"" that could reduce public handshakes or hugs, which might help with reducing spread of coronavirus. However due to the supposed ability of coronavirus to stay active in the air for hours after leaving someone's body (via sneeze or cough), I'm not sure that reducing physical contact would have as much impact as you want it to.

AmItheAsshole,fjb5dim,t1_fjaxxnh,1583186807.0,"Perhaps it's because I'm not disabled, and my primary exposure to the benefits of a wheelchair are through my dad's occasional use, that I haven't encountered the negativity surrounding the phrase wheelchair bound. The ability to move around is something many of us able-bodied people take for granted, but I will never forget how freeing it's been for my dad and the whole family when my dad can borrow a wheelchair and actually enjoy spending time with us without limitations or us worrying that he couldn't breathe. 

Having seen firsthand the freedom given by wheelchairs, I can't grasp how any medical professional would be adverse to the use of one (though I don't doubt you at all when you say they are). 

I think essentially my point is that the phrase ""wheelchair bound"" shouldn't carry any negative connotations because using a wheelchair is not a negative. But if people are told not to use the term, it perpetuates the negativity attached to wheelchair use because people subconsciously link the definition of wheelchair bound (someone who only uses a wheelchair) to being told the phrase is bad. Based on the prevalence of the phrase, I don't see it actually being removed from common usage, but you can still inform people that it's not to be seen as a bad thing by using it with pride."
AmItheAsshole,fjak3bd,t1_fjagfbh,1583175072.0,"The phrase ""wheelchair bound"" only means that someone cannot get up and walk from point A to point B. If anything, that serves to highlight the amazing tool that wheelchairs are and illustrate the freedom offered to those people by having a wheelchair, not knock them for being unable to walk. It also indicates some level of additional care that must be taken to accommodate a wheelchair (ie available ramps instead of just stairs) and make the wheelchair user more easily able to navigate their environment that may not need to be taken for an ambulant wheelchair user (eg my dad can walk down short flights of stairs), but it doesn't take away from the mobility and freedom experienced by people who exclusively use wheelchairs. Outside knowledge of necessary accomodations serves only to benefit wheelchair users. 

Wheelchairs are an amazing invention that help so many people; I don't think there should be any shame in using the phrase ""wheelchair bound"" because to me it doesn't have negative connotations. There's nothing wrong with being in a wheelchair full time so you can do all the same things that ambulatory people do. 

I can tell that you're uncomfortable with that phrase though, and if this is something other wheelchair users feel strongly about as well, I propose the term ""non-ambulent wheelchair user"" to signify someone who uses a wheelchair exclusively for transportation.

actuallesbians,fiznzve,t3_fam7oe,1582868353.0,"Okay I had my first hookup with a girl less than a month ago so I know how you are feeling. Like others have said, communication is important. It lets you know what she wants you to do and how she wants you to do it since everyone is different. Make sure to communicate your inexperience and nervousness so she can be on the same page as you going into it. 

What I found was that knowing how to please myself helped immensely with getting my partner off. It's different because you don't get exactly the same sensory cues to tell you you've found the right spot, but if you're familiar with how your own clit feels on your fingertips, you can find the spot that feels right to your hands and makes her squirm under you. Listen and pay attention to her body language. Watch how she responds to your touch. You'll quickly be able to tell what she likes based on how she reacts, and you can always ask if there is anything else she wants you to try. 

It was much more natural feeling for me to hook up with a girl than with a guy. It was easy and instinctual, probably in part because I know what feels good for me and I tried to replicate that for my partner. I do have prior sexual experience with men, so I did have the knowledge going into it of what I like in terms of someone going down on me, but even if you don't have that knowledge you'll be well served just by masturbating and getting to know your own body."

actuallesbians,fizji69,t1_fiyfqlu,1582864532.0,"A lot of parents don't allow sleepovers because they don't want their child to be sexually active. I'm of the opinion (based on my own experiences as a teenager) that teens who want to be sexually active will be, but doing something like denying sleepovers just ensures they will choose risky places and situations to have sex since their safe space - their bedroom at home - is off limits. Not to mention the fact that it would hurt her friendships and social life to suddenly be cut off from sleepovers.

I think you're doing all the right things. Make sure she is aware of safe sex practices for both men and women, and then continue to allow sleepovers (with the possible addition of allowing male friends to sleep over as well*). When she is ready for something like sex, you know that it will be done safely and responsibly. Not limiting her freedom means she's more likely to continue feeling like she can share important things with you, and more than that helps make sure she isn't actively deceiving you or lying about big things in her life (something I was guilty of as a teen). 

*I wanted to get more in depth on why I think you should transition to also allow sleepovers with guys if she wants to have them, without derailing my prior paragraph. Basically, I came out as bi to my parents and despite my worries about if I'd even still be allowed to have girls over, I was still able to have sleepovers with girls, but not boys. It felt like they were disregarding my sexuality because I distinctly said ""I like girls too"" yet my parents treated all of my relationships with female friends differently than my relationships with male friends. If you remove parental fear of sex (which obviously doesn't happen with every sleepover and a lot of them will be completely platonic endeavors) from the equation, there is no logical reason to prevent sleepovers between teens of opposite genders. So you said you don't see why her sexuality would change sleepovers; I think if it changes anything it's that you should treat her relationships with girls and boys the same."

TalesFromThePharmacy,fi65vfr,t1_fi61ac2,1582180074.0,Where I work in the US we always substitute generic for brand unless the patient requests otherwise or the doctor tells us it has to be filled as brand name only. We can only substitute tablets for capsules if the doctor wrote for a form that doesn't exist or that we simply never carry (looking at you doctors that write for amoxicillin tablets as if we ever do anything but capsules for amoxicillin).
TalesFromThePharmacy,fi65mat,t1_fi5a7ce,1582179813.0,"My store does not get an automated filling machine or an automated counting machine (too expensive). Thus we try to send all non-urgent scripts to be put into the orange vials at an off-site warehouse location which does have automated filling capabilities. Even still, the warehouse only accepts roughly 20-30% of prescriptions we fill, leaving the rest to be counted by hand. So yes, I do have to manually count out the 240 oxycodone, plus a double count to be sure and a back count of the stock bottle. Many stock bottles are 100 count which makes things easier on those of us without automated counting machines, but for stores with automated counting machines 1,000 count stock bottles (for non controls) are the more economical option. 

Not to mention, the prescription needs to be processed initially by: linking it to the correct patient; identifying the doctor and which office they are at; choosing the right drug; inputting when it was written, how we received it (hard copy, electronic, fax, voicemail, or transfer from another pharmacy), quantity, and refills; typing up the instructions; and billing through insurance (or a discount card or run as cash pay which are simpler options) which can involve additional hoops to jump through like prior authorizations or calling the doctor to change medication to something that is covered (eg. Celebrex is not covered but Meloxicam is) or altering directions to ensure insurance coverage (eg. insurance only covers 3 ondansetron per day but the doc wrote that it can be taken every 6-8 hours as needed so we need the sig changed to say just every 8 hours). 

It's only once the initial processing is done that we can even begin the pre-verification (where the pharmacist ensures the technician typed it correctly). After pre-ver is the dispensing step. Following that is another verification step where the pharmacist ensures the pills in the bottle are the correct thing. It's only after verification that we can release a prescription. 

When you handle 200+ prescriptions per day and need to do that much just to fill one prescription, a wait time of 25-30 minutes is actually fairly reasonable.

If both people are focused only on one script, experienced pharmacist/technician teams can complete a single script in about 2 minutes. 

It seems like pharmacy is a completely different ballgame in the US compared to other countries."
TalesFromThePharmacy,fi6262v,t1_fi5khiw,1582176588.0,"I got a stern warning from my manager recently.

I immediately responded ""if that's not good enough for you then I can give the scripts back and you can go somewhere else"". 

For some reason the patient didn't want to take me up on my generous offer to let them go somewhere with better service. But when I turned around I swear my manager's jaw had just dropped and she was still picking it up. 

Responding like that is out of character for me, and she was shocked because she knew I had taken Xanax slightly earlier in my shift and couldn't believe that I would respond that way while calmer than usual. Really I just wasn't afraid to stand up for myself because my usual anxiety was gone."

I mean the intense anxiety was not fine, but I didn't get sick. 

I think my parents consider my emetophobia to be silly, but they recognize that I can't do anything about it and they'll even go so far as to not mention if they aren't feeling well or if a bug is going around to spare me the horrible fear. 

Even nowadays if I hear the phrase ""I don't feel good"" I panic. Or if I hear a sound I can't immediately identify. Or if I get too warm because sometimes that causes nausea. Or if people around me are drinking. I could honestly go on. It's so hard to be afraid of one of the body's basic, if not frequent for most people, functions.

Given what you've said about your preferences, I think I have to agree with the suggestions from other people to try a nose piercing! I think you would look nice with either a septum or a nostril piercing, but a nostril ring is what immediately sprung to mind when I saw your picture. 

Or depending on your hairstyle, an ear piercing could be cool too! I got my industrial done last night and really like it! I have long hair but I had it pulled back today so I can show off the new piercing (even though my coworkers didn't notice 😢). 

I'm on mobile so I can't see the picture right now, but if you don't already have them ear lobes would also be great for individuality and options for what you can put in there. Mine healed really well (to be fair I've had them for 17 years now) so I can choose to either have nothing or to put something in and it's easy (read: pain-free and not time consuming) to change out the jewelry as well as to find variety in styles of jewelry because it's probably the most common piercing.

TalesFromThePharmacy,femdf5j,t1_femccxc,1579249801.0,"I think you may be right about that, but he really didn't strike me as someone to be concerned about in terms of abuse because he had filled with us previously, his PDMP was okay and the pharmacist allowed us to fill it, and despite getting meds with us in the past he had never picked up Percocet. Coupled with his clear physical signs of going to the dentist (swollen face and bloody gauze in his mouth) and the fact that the script was written by a dentist for a small quantity of 5/325, I'd put money on him just being in pain and not handling it well at all. I don't think that's any sort of excuse to treat me like he did, but I do think the prescription was legitimate and necessary following his dental work.

My pharmacist verified the RX and stepped out to go to the bathroom, not realizing she would need to counsel the patient on the med because he had never gotten it from us before (our system doesn't alert us that a counsel is needed until I try to release it). So she was not present for most of the interaction, and it was her getting back, scanning her badge, and telling him how to take it safely that allowed me to hand it to him and get him to leave. From ready status, I would've also needed her to scan her badge to reverse it and return the hard copy, so it was easiest and fastest to give him the meds and have him leave.

But it was great because I could drop them off a couple days early and pick them up the day before my surgery, allowing me to go straight home after the surgery without being a drugged up mess at the pharmacy while waiting for meds. I appreciated that, but still thought it could have turned out badly for them if I (or someone who is more likely to abuse the meds than me) flaked out on the surgery because of fear and ended up with pain meds and no pain.
