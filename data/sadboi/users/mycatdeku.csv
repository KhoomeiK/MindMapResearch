Allergies,fqtz9lr,t3_gkxtd0,1589648964.0,I don’t think taking that much of those OTC meds will change the effectiveness. Like taking more than the max dose might not actually affect how well it will work and you might just be wasting money doing that. I’m not sure if dust mites came up on your test but Rx singulair has really helped me for my dust allergy. I would also recommend getting an air purifier (HEPA) in your room if you don’t already have one- mine really helps me sleep better at night. I would take some Benadryl before bed to help with the itchiness so you can sleep better too.
ECEProfessionals,f65ztcv,t3_dowgs7,1572706677.0,"I would say the most important thing is to be transparent with the parents. If you are asking yourself “should I call the parent?” Just do it. If you use tadpoles or some other app send tons of pics!!! Parents love seeing the little moments throughout the day. 

Your job is to help the babies feel secure with their caretakers, so it’s okay to take an extra moment to just sit on the rocking chair and have some cuddles with one of the babies! Take time to bond during changing and feeding. This is an amazing job to have!! Good luck!!!"
ECEProfessionals,f48gdi8,t3_djtw7p,1571438630.0,"I have honestly enjoyed my experience and it has been so much better than the privately owned center I have worked for before. I really think each center has their own culture and I’m just thankful that the one I’m at is not nearly as toxic as is the norm it seems in a lot of centers. I like that they value continuing education/professional development and have a set curriculum for each age group, which makes lesson planning so much easier. My center is also really good about actually supplying the classrooms. Always remember as much as they are interviewing you, you are also interviewing them to figure out if it will actually be a good fit for you. Good luck!❤️"

I don’t think Chloe needs to stay with him at all and is 100% justified if she ditches his ass (in fact it would probably be beneficial for their child in the long run). But max is so young and can’t see the path he’s headed down. I really hope he gets some decent coping mechanisms or goes to a treatment facility.
TLCUnexpected,eyuvzzk,t3_cyxwv6,1567473635.0,I was literally about to post the same thing!!! I couldn’t get over her shaming him for wanting to go to therapy. She obviously doesn’t understand addiction and the generational/familial issues that come with it. I still think Max is a pos but she’s giving him crap for trying to better himself and it’s so upsetting to see.

bipolar2,exsahf4,t1_exh8rvj,1566537677.0,"I had a very similar experience! I had just come of out the hospital after a suicide attempt and was having a really hard time acclimating back to college life. I got a kitten instead because I knew with my busy schedule I wouldn’t be able to care for a dog in the sense of letting them out every couple hours or giving them space to run. 

I feel the same exact way about my cat. When I can’t find any reason to live I always remember that he is depending on me and I remember how much I love him. 

I tell everyone he’s my ESA in more ways than just comfort. He literally holds me accountable for so many things. Didn’t take out the trash? You bet he’s digging through it. Didn’t get out of bed in time to feed him? Crawling all over me until I get up. 

In the last year he’s even been able to pick up on when I’m about to get a migraine before I do. I know something is coming if he’s glued right next to me no matter where I go or if I move. 

OP I would highly recommend looking into getting a cat if you feel like you have the capacity to support the animal for the next 20 or so years. Food cost and vet cost is similar to dogs but cats are much less physical maintenance. All they need is fresh food, water, a clean litter box, and to be played with a couple minutes every day. You may not be able to take a cat into work everyday, but when you are home a cat’s love is incomparable."
bipolar2,exs95oq,t3_cu7446,1566536343.0,I would highly recommend talking to your pharmacist.

I will say that if you have a decent psychiatrist they will treat the symptoms before trying to treat a diagnosis if that makes sense. Like if they deem it needed or helpful they will definitely prescribe a mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. If you have a decent treatment team they will be all about helping you feel stable no matter the diagnosis!"

bipolar,exn2dm8,t3_ctqn6k,1566444622.0,"For your intake appointment they will probably ask about your life circumstances, childhood, any traumas, etc. Therapists generally don’t diagnose (I’m not sure if they legally can?) but they can tell you what they think might be going on and should be able to help you navigate that conversation with a psychiatrist. 

I’m not a mental health professional, but I’ve been in and out of various hospitals, out patients, therapists, and psychiatrists since early adolescence so this is how I believe the diagnosis realm works. I’m pretty sure your psychiatrist will have to have documentation of you cycling through different mood levels (mania, hypomania, depression, major depression) within whatever time frame the DSM says in order to have a true diagnosis for bipolar 1 or 2. 

I would suggest being completely transparent with your symptoms- the good and the bad as to give your therapist an accurate description of what’s actually going on. If you think you may be bipolar it may help to lay that out there because bipolar 2 can be really tricky to diagnose. A lot of people with bipolar 2, myself included, tend to not reach out for help until you’re in the pits of depression, which is why it can easily mask as MDD. 

These are just my tidbits and I hope at least some of it helped. Sending you tons of ~positive vibes~ good luck!!"

raisedbyborderlines,exg6vzr,t1_exe9scz,1566256810.0,I’m not sure of the science but in my personal experience people with bpd have a tendency to completely victimize themselves in every situation.

TheHandmaidsTale,ew83zor,t3_cn1l9g,1565202858.0,"I really liked how Fred saw Tuello trying to manipulate him right away, where as Serena still has no clue that he’s just playing her (I hope). Also, I would LOVE if Serena sold out her husband to life in prison for ONE HOUR with the baby. Like total. For the rest of her life. I find that so hilarious but it really shows how delusional Serena Joy is at this point. Fred called it with her “obsession with that baby.” 

I can really see how June could have very easily played herself with letting Eleanor die, and there’s no way that Joseph doesn’t know it was her. June is getting so cocky and I really think she has been in Gilead for so long that she no longer sees the bigger picture and where she fits in. 

One thing I’ve been thinking about is the fact that I’m not sure if Commander Lawrence knows about the Martha network? I think he thinks that it’s just him and June orchestrating this, which could ultimately be his downfall if he tries to stop it altogether. That’s the leverage June has on him at this point. 

In June letting Eleanor die for the sake of the children, she’s honestly just doing the same things that Joseph has been doing. If anything, he taught her when he had her choose the 5 women to save earlier in the season. 

This is my first post here and I’m not sure if I’m supposed to talk about the promo, but I wanted to say that the shot of her running in the forest away from the Eyes shooting at her is extremely reflective of when she initially tried to escape with Hannah at the start of the show. Which also has me wondering if history will repeat itself???"
Hair,ew66gyx,t3_cn0jab,1565155728.0,I think the toner should wash out over time which would take the hair closer to where it was pre toner. You can expedite that process by using a clarifying or dandruff shampoo as it will strip some of the toner out  over multiple washes. There are other at home diy’s to getting the toner out but I’ve only used clarifying or dandruff shampoos on myself for that purpose.

They also have people who can support you while you are on academic probation. 

As far as signing up now, I wouldn’t think of it so much as an excuse for them, but rather it offers context as to what is happening in your academic career."
bipolar,ew3c65t,t3_cmeh0p,1565071968.0,"I’m going to be completely honest there weren’t many accommodations if any that my school gave me for being registered with the disability office as far as a regular basis type thing. What they did help with extremely well, however, is that every time I would have to stop school in the middle of a semester (which happened more than once) the office was a great liaison between me and my professors, and helped me find ways to finish my classes. 

Edit: I never actually said this, but yes I would highly recommend it. Even if they don’t have many accommodations to give you it’s in your best interest to have your diagnoses on record if shit ever hits the fan mental health wise."
