The bride was more focused on the what ifs and the hypotheticals and the venue was literally telling her that they could either still go thru with the wedding that Saturday or they could reschedule it for the bride. And the bride had the audacity to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already waited 6 years so what‚Äôs the point in waiting another year‚Äù lmao like sis if you‚Äôve already waited 6 YEARS another year ain‚Äôt gonna matter if it‚Äôs the love of your life...

In Jenna‚Äôs case, she was in an abusive relationship and pregnant. Her goal of getting out of the relationship was to enter and win the pie contest. She had something to look forward to to help get herself out of that toxic relationship. At the end of the show, she realizes that she had a way out the whole time, she just had to find the strength within herself to leave."

HealthInsurance,eyfggd8,t3_cwuo1n,1567048427.0,"Honestly, there really is no way to know beforehand unfortunately. There are a lot of factors that come into play when determining the ‚Äúprice‚Äù, such as procedure codes, diagnosis codes, where the procedure is taking place (office or facility), as well as any additional costs that may arise, such as anesthesia and medical supplies used. All in all, it is really almost impossible (and risky) to give out any prices beforehand, because it all depends on how it is coded. If you call in and tell the insurance you are getting a biopsy and they tell you it‚Äôll cost $500 and it actually ends up costing $2,000, then they‚Äôll be in hot water, you‚Äôll be upset, and the provider will probably not end up getting paid accurately. This is why insurance is usually prohibited from sharing that information, and also the insurance really doesn‚Äôt know either UNTIL the claim is received and goes through the claims process.

Sorry this probably isn‚Äôt what you want to hear, but that‚Äôs our country‚Äôs healthcare for ya... :( 

If you can find a plan that has set copays for procedures, I‚Äôd go for it! But I know that now a lot of plans are deductible first, then coinsurance. 

Oh, also... does your insurance let you register an account online? Sometimes they have a cost estimator online, which usually only gives a  VERY ROUGH estimate for a procedure, but that might help you get a ballpark idea."
