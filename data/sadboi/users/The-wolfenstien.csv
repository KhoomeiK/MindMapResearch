Oh i hate those calls to be honest, but at certain times i have also got calls where the original reason jlis way different and they just ask for the balance coz they were on hold for long and just want to get something done.

The bank i work for gives an option to call from the mobile application , right above the call option are your balance details and transfer options, and we still get calls from the application to check the balance amd do transfers."

AskMen,exzrbsv,t3_cutauf,1566669865.0,"Went backpacking with friends and we were sitting by a river and smoking weed, all of a sudden a monkey pops up from nowhere and grabs our food packet we couldn't do much but he went away and returned and this time grabbed one of our sleeping bags (we had one of those really light ones) and we were too stoned to anything else we were essentially just trying to shoo him away, the monkey flipped out so i tries being the alpha by making loud noises which i guess pissed it off or something, it just came towards me as if it was charging for an attack, i tried backing off and it was on me like a heat seeking missile, i had a cigarette in my hand i threw it on him, he was unfazed and now growling or doing something of that sorts , my fight or flight hormones kicked in ,i certainly felt the adrenaline rush and ended up kicking the monkey in its chin, for a second both me and the monkey were surprised of what happend, then all of a sudden it jumped back climbed a tree and shook that tree and i was shook too, that was probably the most scary thing i ever encountered, all i could think was that i was about to be mauled down by a group of monkeys, so we picked our bags and scrambled the hell out of there."
