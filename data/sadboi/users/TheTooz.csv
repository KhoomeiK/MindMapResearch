Most people spend the majority of their lives working under authoritarian dictatorships, you have literally no say in company policy and the profit from your labor is exploited by the owner/investors. Under a capitalism system it is possible to own a company that you don't work for and work for a company that you don't own. 


This is something we could theoretically change overnight without much systematic upheaval, the only thing that would immediately change is who owns the means of production. This would be a transitional period of market socialism, but soon, as material conditions begin to equalize, the 2nd part of socialism is realized; the abolition of the value form or profit motive, in which products of labor do not becomes commodities, but rather are produced according to need. 


All of this results in the empowerment of individual workers and the ability to self-actualize, which is in stark contrast to the alienation we currently suffer. I think this was mentioned elsewhere in this thread, but anthropologically speaking, our species spent some 400,000 years as proto-communists and only the last 11,000 under feudalism, mercantilism, and then capitalism."
