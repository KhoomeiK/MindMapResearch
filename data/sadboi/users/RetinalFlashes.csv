(big gap bc I stopped listening as I got real into grunge music, smoking weed and doing psychedelics. Taylor's music just didn't fit in that phase of my life lol)



Red = at the tail end of the Red Era I moved to a couple different cities and waited tables. I didn't listen to it on purpose but I loved hearing it come on the radio. I was a bit wild during this time bc for locals in this one city, a pitcher of beer was $2 on weekends. And there were lots of European foreign exchange graduates on work visas, who really liked hanging out and all they did was drink. 

1989 = I moved back home and went through a manic episode where I remember going running in the middle of the night drunk a lot, listening to Welcome to New York and just feeling the euphoria of that song. That album just had such beautiful energy

Reputation = I had just finished a year long stint in the Navy training for the reserves when I found out about Rep. It was a really tough year for me because of some other reasons. I was really into Nirvana for a while (Idk why that sticks in my mind). I started trying to finish my degree again. I absolutely loved the new dark/sassy vibe of a lot of the songs and listened to it a lot at least for the rest of that year. 

Lover = lover really just came out at the perfect time for me. Things in my life have started to settle down and relax. I'm healthier mentally then I was the past 10 years. I'm still married to the love of my life (God knows how he put up with me) even through my dark days. I can't wait to see what she's got coming out next."
