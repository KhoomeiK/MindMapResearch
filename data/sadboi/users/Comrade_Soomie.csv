tech,fqyaxsv,t1_fqy8bzd,1589745653.0,"I will start by outlining that I’m a 5’5” female. I worked seasonally as a park ranger and dealt with homeless persons and panhandlers often. Most of them are cool and good people to talk to. The reason I differentiate homeless from panhandlers is because homeless for the most part are good people who for way of drugs or mental illness or some other bad outcome in life have ended up that way. Panhandler on the other hand may have a similar story but I haven’t met a single panhandler that hasn’t talked to me for an extended time and all but told me they have chosen the lifestyle or chosen to stay in it after finding themselves in it. Talk to them for any amount of time and they will bluntly tell you that it’s their hustle and how they make their living. You can tell quick enough someone homeless trying to survive from someone hustling with no intention of making an honest living even if given the opportunity. Those are the ones we talked to at the park for illegally camping. Their camps always had stolen electronics, drugs, etc that they had an intention of reselling for money. They stole from tourists and they stole from other homeless people. They spent every day at the same corner With the same sign for years because it’s their hustle and they will tell you as much if you talk to them long enough person to person. I don’t give money to panhandlers because I’ve come to know this. Best thing you can do is not even acknowledge them on the street when you have to walk past them. You say you don’t have cash and they will say “That’s okay, we can walk to the atm over there.” You tell them your bank makes you pay atm fees and they will say “That’s okay, I have a card reader on my iPhone right here” or “Do you have Venmo/Cash App?” The one thing that they never had a response to was “Sorry, I only have a credit card and I’m not paying a cash advance.” But the best thing to do is not even acknowledge them. Don’t make eye contact, don’t speak, just keep walking. 

So why were they worse in Austin? They were more aggressive. Usually if you just keep walking or say no thanks in every other city they are polite and say “no worries, have a blessed day” or even “go fuck yourself.” In Austin I had three separate situations that were extremely uncomfortable. 

1). A man stepped right in front of my path and made it incredibly difficult to walk around him. It wasn’t until a hotel doorman said “Hey man, let the lady pass” before he finally backed down and walked away. He had been hanging around the hotel for three days and after the third time of me not acknowledging him when he was asking for money he decided to block my path. 

2). A man followed me down the street for three blocks cursing me and calling me every name in the book before he finally got distracted by someone else and started telling them the same story he told me while following me. 

3). A man actually grabbed my arm and pulled me back after I walked past him without answering him asking for money. A man in my work group was coming out around the same time and yelled at him asking what he was doing. 

Never had that happen in any other city. Not Atlanta, Los Angeles, Charleston, Denver, Nassau, Freeport, Rio, São Paulo, Philadelphia. Just Austin. Beautiful city but they’ve created a mess about not addressing the panhandling issue downtown."
tech,fqy6nik,t1_fqxe25r,1589743489.0,I moved to Denver and a year and a half later went to Austin for a week on a business trip. I don’t even want to hear about crime in Denver after being in Austin. I’ve been to Rocinha in Rio de Janeiro and felt safer on the street there than I did in Downtown Austin near the Salvation Army. Denver panhandlers are nothing compared to Austin. I’m not even talking homeless because I differentiate homeless vs homeless panhandler. Austin panhandlers were a whole other level of any big city I’ve been to.
smallbusiness,fqefvw8,t1_fqe1gza,1589306876.0,I’m going to tell them to just apply. They don’t pay SUTA on themselves but it seems that other business owners who don’t are receiving PUA at the least. I don’t think any of the states know what’s going on and there is no guidance from the feds.
smallbusiness,fqefqeb,t1_fqe8xtr,1589306802.0,"That’s good to know. It has been so difficult to find information whether for employees or employers. My parents exhausted benefits in April and were due to start a job that was rescinded due to Covid. It took my mother calling the governors office after being left with no answers for over a month before her PUA magically showed up last night as approved. However there is no documentation or explanation. It just showed up. I don’t think anyone knows what is going on. SC is still sorely behind on building their system for PEUC and so many are left stranded and penniless. The former exhaustees were left in a gap and were not accounted for when the feds drafted FPUC, PEUC, and PUA. Now my parents have some friends that are business owners that haven’t been able to get a small business loan yet and wondered if they could get PUA. Been trying to find resources to forward to my parents but they’re few and far between. I think at this point all you can do is apply and hope for the best."

Denver,fqdzdwc,t3_ghvvq0,1589299206.0,"This is ridiculous. When I read the news story on Sunday I knew they would be shut down first thing Monday morning when the health department opened. I’m not sure what they really expected because they admitted blatant defiance and didn’t even make an attempt to open with state mandated safety procedures in place. The owners got on the news and said they had to do something or they would go bankrupt and close. Okay, so you do what you did and cause that to happen to yourself. Many small business owners are now eligible for PUA under UI assistance even if they didn’t elect to pay into UI previously. This information isn’t widely available and it varies from state to state but all are encouraged to apply to know for certain whether they are or are not eligible. At any rate, maybe business owners going forward will see the merits in electing to pay UI on themselves along with their employees, or at the very least elect to take out private unemployment insurance which became popular after 2008. Running a business isn’t cheap and you have to plan for these things. That’s the point of INSURANCE. This was not the fault of employers or employees but it highlights the importance of maintaining savings, reducing costs, and not living beyond one’s means. Employers should know this because owning a business is owning a risk. Sometimes the payoff is high and sometimes it fails. That’s just how it is and you have to navigate it as best as you can. It’s tough out here for business owners right now, and the federal loans are dried up, but you have to be proactive if you want to try to save your business. Trim the fat, contact your debtors who will probably be willing to work with you as much as they can given the situation, reach out to the state and feds and get info on resources available for you. I just have a feeling these two didn’t do any of that. They just pouted and acted out by thumbing their nose at not only the government, but their fellow business owners (who btw are also hurting), their patrons, and their community at large. If they go bankrupt it’s their own fault and they need to put on the big boy and big girl pants and accept their own part in it."

CovIdiots,fpxfomn,t3_gezery,1588981801.0,"I keep an open mind and am willing to listen to anything and form an opinion on it. Here’s what makes me especially interested in it: how much it’s trying to be stifled. You have 9/11 conspiracy videos, anti-vax conspiracy videos, etc. Those haven’t been taken down. So you wonder if maybe it’s because of COVID misinformation that will make people stop wearing a mask or social distancing. Well, you can pull that out of it even though it isn’t dwelled upon or overt. Yet the videos of Trump talking about injecting bleach remain across social media. Anti-quarantine doctors and anti-vax videos remain. Then here comes this video and they’ve put a lot of muscle into making it disappear. I work in the public sector so when I think about the government somehow engineering and carrying out Something like 9/11 I chuckle because it takes an act of Congress to put a pen on an order sheet. That’s not to say military intelligence agencies aren’t working on bio projects where someone makes a mistake and things get screwed up. I’m not saying the US or Chinese governments nefariously engineered a virus in a laboratory and released it. However, its not improbable that something couldn’t accidentally make its way from a lab where it’s being studied. Is that what happened here? Who knows. If it did and it’s ever released 75% of the report will be redacted. I’ve been trying to look into some stuff on mentioned on the video. Several articles in government websites have admitted to not being able to fully trace the origin of the Ebola virus. I’ve known that for a while. She does mention something about the anti malarial drug having shown to be successful against viruses in the Coronavirus family. So far I haven’t been able to find any academic journals on this but I’m still looking. At any rate, the situation is weird. For a while I’ve been wondering why the federal government keeps snatching supplies away from states in bidding wars and then refusing to release them. I figured it was a political thing, but who knows. The whole situation is weird whether deliberate or grossly negligent from incompetence in leadership."
PublicFreakout,fpvzrd0,t1_fpt51ll,1588954747.0,"I agree wholeheartedly with your second to last paragraph. There’s this whole southern hospitality stereotype. I personally find midwesterners and westerners to be the nicest people in the country overall. They genuinely want to get to know you and check in on you. Southerners on the other hand are what I call sugary sweet. They’re sweet and nice on the surface but as soon as you walk away they’re going to gossip about and judge you. Way too nosy about what their neighbors or someone they don’t even know on the other side of a restaurant. My mom in SC told me yesterday by phone that she was standing outside getting some fresh air and sunshine. This woman on vacation in the house across the small road was on a second story wrap around porch having lunch with her two daughters. This woman seriously calls security at the resort on my mom saying she is always standing out there watching them. My mom being the outspoken southerner hat she is turned around from the security guard and called up to the woman “Nobody is watching you but if you don’t like being glanced at or people looking around from time to time take yourself inside to eat.” the woman high tailed it inside. 

For one a Midwesterner wouldn’t care. For two they wouldn’t call security for that. It’s funny because on the east coast if you ride the metro and play music out loud people WILL come up to you and confront you about it. In Denver everyone stares at their lap, glances over, sighs, and looks out the window. I once watched this car with MA plates (probably from Boston) lay down the horn and follow a car for two blocks horn going to whole time because he switched lanes in front of him. All the denverites just watched all calm and cow eyed as it happened and until the car got down the street and turned. Then they just shook their head and kept walking."

PublicFreakout,fprppcz,t1_fpq3al9,1588859584.0,"I moved to CO two years ago. I think it’s also the rugged western mentality too. People in the west tend to be more individualist and isolated. I’m not a morning person so I feel like my brain isn’t helping me explain this well.  but going back to the days of frontiers and mining. People in the Midwest and west had to put down roots in a place where things struggle to grow. People were spread out and didn’t intermingle the way they did on the coasts. I think they’re some of the nicest people in the country but there are certain cultural aspects that come out. People on the coasts are used to knowing what a city is and what happens when people move to it. They understand people do it for jobs. On the coast and especially the northeast big cities are pretty close but in the west things are spread out and far. Your opinion of far changes. My family in S.C. thinks driving six miles to a store is far but to me that’s just normal Now. I drive 20 miles one way to work. Far out here is driving from Denver to grand junction, limon, or Pueblo. But in Denver if you want to get to the next major city it’s pretty far. Omaha is an 8 hour drive, Santa Fe is 6.5, Salt Lake City I believe is between 7-9 hours. The Grand Canyon is 12 hours, Texas I believe is somewhere between 10-18. Also many people who move here tend to be rude and trash trails and stuff. People in SC hate Ohioans and are pretty vocal about it. Coloradans born and raised multi generations are extremely nice and tend to grumble quietly to or amongst themselves. First thing I was asked was whether I moved to CO for weed. Once the locals I became friends/coworkers with realized I came because S.C. didn’t have good job prospects they respected that because it tied into their culture of what brought people to Colorado historically. Majority of local Coloradans I’ve met are true salt of the earth people. Not flashy or materialistic or fast paced like people on the coast tend to be."

Things won’t be like they were in January 2020 but they won’t be widely different either. I imagine masks will start becoming mandatory on public transits and flights, food service will probably come with less human interaction etc. These aren’t necessarily bad things but I think inAmerica we’ve become accustomed to a certain level of privilege and safety that it will upset some people and make them feel like someone is trampling on their rights by telling them they can’t enter without a mask.

Coronavirus,fpk5v3c,t1_fpj3xt4,1588688583.0,"Right? Idk, the economist in me just feels that rather than inflating falling demand through subsidies in the dairy industry that the federal government should have been using the money to help the dairy farmers transition to the technology to produce plant based milks which is where demand is rising. Companies that were able to, such as Tyson, saw the light and made space for plant based options. Research labs lowered the price of producing one lab grown burger from hundreds of dollars down to about $26 in the last few years. Federal government has thrown themselves behind incorporating lab meat because it’s cheaper, healthier, better for the environment etc. It will come whether people like it or not and it’s not a bad thing. What’s bad is the government not adequately transitioning producers over so that they can stay in business. And if anyone is wondering why I’m talking about dairy and not meat it’s because 15% of beef comes from spent dairy cows of about 5 years old. They’re interconnected industries that have been supported to limp along by the government. I’m pro Keynesian but I also believe hayak had a point about not letting markets work. As sad as it is we shouldn’t prop up industries that are failing for decades. That’s how we end up here. What we should have done is help farmers get technology to switch to something better. Imagine if we kept trying to prop up elevator operators when technology surpassed their efficiency."
ADHD,fpk2jo4,t3_gdwecz,1588686688.0,"I spent a lot of years experimenting various things to lose weight. Counted calories, counted macros, powerlifted, ran, high fat low carb, intermittent fasting, lowered added sugar, etc. I’m 5’5” and at my highest weight I was 169lbs. I’m now 129-132lbs and have been for about two years with no exercise or effort. Things that helped me the most:

Reducing consumption of added sugar December 2016: the WHO recommends staying below 30g of ADDED sugars lee day. Luckily the FDA mandates that be on labels now. This one didn’t shave off weight fast but it helped more than counting calories or weighing food. And it’s good for overall health. 

Intermittent fasting June 2017. I started this first and saw changes. In fact I’ve put a friend on it in May 2018 and he has gone from 230lbs to 190s without changing anything else. It’s great because it’s how human bodies were designed to be back when we were nomads and food wasn’t readily available. It puts your body into a natural deficit and lets its fat burning mechanism work for that reason. There are different ways to do it but I and my friend did a 16:8. That’s where you have an 8 hour window where you eat meals and 16 hours where you’re fasting (drinking only water, black coffee, black tea, etc). 

Going vegan January 2018: I often wonder if my weight loss is due to going vegan or starting Adderall. The biggest thing I think was going vegan(whole food plant based. I stopped fasting and switched to that and weight started dropping faster. There are actually a lot of research studies out there that suggest whole food plant based diets reduce and even reverse things like heart disease, type two diabetes, and risk of various cancers. Animal products can make you fat really easily (looking at you cheese). Now, you can get fat as a vegan because Oreos are vegan. Just going to warn you. But WHOLE FOOD PLANT BASED diet takes that stuff away and is one of the best if not best diets for health. If you’re wondering the difference as vegans we do it primarily for animal rights. Whole food plant based dieters do it for health, the environment etc. personally, I’m a vegan and do it for all three. 

February 2018: moved from the southeast to Colorado where there are many more vegan options and the culture is overall more health oriented and proactive. Was down to about 151lbs at this point. 

April 2018: I happen to watch Take Your Pills on Netflix and ask my doctor about ADHD. I’m currently over a decade into treatment for bipolar disorder and depression but am unraveling and can’t get my shit together. He gives me Adderall and says I will know within a few days if I have adhd. Holy wow. It was like putting on glasses for the first time. The weight started dropping between vegan and Adderall. 

May 2018: get a seasonal job as a park ranger where I work outside daily and bike to work round trip 8 miles. 

September 2018: start an office job in my field but the commute is 20 miles one way by metro. 

October 2018: my weight is down to a buffer of 129-132 where it has remained ever since. 

I still eat vegan but eat plenty of sweets too because I’ve gotten slack about monitoring added sugars. 

I never exercise. I’m serious. I might walk but I’m lazy af and hate the gym and running. I want to be better about this for health but it’s so boring and uncomfortable to me. 

I take three bipolar medications and Adderall. 

I don’t weigh food, count macros, or count calories. 

Yes I’m weaker and don’t have the muscle mass or ability i used to BUT this has nothing to do with being vegan. This is because I don’t prioritize protein consumption and unless you’re weightlifting or working out people don’t need as much protein as they think they do. Some of the strongest athletes in the world are vegan/plant based. They just eat a heck of a lot more protein and calories than I do as does an Omni athlete. 

I’ve noticed when I’ve taken long breaks from Adderall that I start to binge eat and crave sweets. I realized Adderall helps with that. The reason is because when we don’t have enough dopamine we seek it out and sugar and carbs REALLY does it for an adhd brain since it boosts dopamine. Adderall doesn’t affect my appetite at all. I still get big girl hungry and I’m lucky since many don’t. But my point is that it corrects overeating for me since that was part of my Adderall. It helps me know when to stop and recognize if I’m physically or mentally hungry. 

I have references and resources to all of this if you’re curious and want to see if there is real evidence that they work. Can grab any you want from medical and scientific based sources. 

Some things to keep in mind:

Your diet may be due to a medical reason. If you aren’t having any weird symptoms I would try diet changes first. Many people told me I was just big boned or had a slow metabolism but when I look back and am honest with myself I wasn’t eating a healthy diet and my body was storing fat because of how I was eating and how the body naturally processes those things. HOWEVER, always consult with your doctor about changes in case anything comes up you may be missing. 

Weight isn’t everything. People will see changes before you can. You may see changes in blood work before you do body weight. These are still good things. Be kind to yourself and give yourself back pats where they’re do. If you do vegan plant based diet or intermittent fasting and are able to j recommend getting blood work done and then follow it up 6-12 months later. It may surprise you a lot. 

You can’t out exercise a bad diet. The body is not a machine. You can’t try to outsmart it by manipulating simple thermodynamics within a complex sustem. Counting calories is pointless for this reason. Calorie deficits help but they aren’t efficient and mean as soon as you stop counting and weighing you will go right back where you are. You would have to mountain bike for something like 6 hours to burn off a Big Mac if I remember correctly. You can’t do it. No one can. Work with your body and assist its preferred and natural ability to manage weight: how you eat. The quality of the food. Exercise for general health but not to lose weight. You’ll be miserable and probably quit. 

Be kind to yourself."

She said she always felt sad for her 2008 graduates because they graduated straight into the worst recession since the Great Depression. The majority of them couldn’t find jobs and ended up in low skilled occupations outside of their majors. Around 2010 when the economy finally picked up again these graduates were overlooked for the 2010 graduates. Many of them never recovered from that. Best advice I can offer to current graduates is to work on yourself. If you can’t get a job that gives you the experience that you need then find a way to get that experience yourself and out it on your resume. If what you want to do favors any kind of programming or analysis, spend time learning it now. Find a job in government if you can. Local, state, feds. If you want extra job security go into labor economics because they have inverse demand. I was laid off from my first job after graduating. Four months in. Private sector. Took me a year and a half of underemployment before i got a job in my field. Got a job in government and you could offer me $120k a year over my $47k salary and I wouldn’t take it.

You shouldn’t even have to fight your kids long term on this. Put them in their room, take their cell phone away, put parental control on their internet and get to work. I think the problem these days that I see even before this is that parents try too hard to be their child’s friend than to discipline them and lead them as a parent and mentor."
Coronavirus,fpgd1ci,t3_gd53pc,1588600158.0,"There are things the government isn’t doing enough to help out small business owners. That doesn’t make things right. HOWEVER, I am also able to argue that there are risks to operating a business. If you’re running at just under a loss or paycheck to paycheck with no savings, then your business is at risk. People who ARE running a business with a profit are also at risk but can take more risk. I see this with lessors right now. People on the coasts of SC who own property that they rent out for about $1000-3000k a week through the entire summer season. They’ve been told they can’t rent to people and they have lost their fool minds. Such greediness and hatred because they didn’t plan for something like this and have already spent what they were paid for upcoming vacation rentals, refusing to refund people’s’ money. If you didn’t learn after 2008 that relying on passive real estate income as your sole income with no savings plan in place isnt a good idea then I don’t know what to tell you. There exists something called liability insurance and income replacement insurance that employers can take out. That’s the whole point of it. Insurance companies are now even starting to offer liability for pandemic insurance. The same goes for employees. After 2008 private unemployment insurance became popular. It offers more and lasts longer than government UI AND you don’t have to jump through as many hoops to get to because it’s YOUR money on YOUR insurance policy. I think the real issue is the hot hand fallacy. People think things will never go sour. 2008 happens and people get scared. Then they get a taste of cheap and easily available credit and they start to forget about the last recession. They take out a $500k mortgage and a car loan on $40k truck. They spend money and run up credit cards. Then this happens and they want to complain to everyone except themselves. I’m not talking about low income living paycheck to paycheck or hand to mouth. I’m talking about people with decent means trying to live above them."

TwoXChromosomes,fp5xom3,t3_gbfsvq,1588342120.0,"Parents have no business making remarks like that about their children’s bodies. Father’s especially have no business making comments like those about their daughters’ bodies. I used to weight lift and at the time I was overweight and had body image issues. Weightlifting gave me some freedom back because I felt I couldn’t control my weight at the time but I could control what my body could *do*. I used to do all of the calorie counting, macro weighing, low carb high fat, intermittent fasting etc and results were slow and hard to see. But each week I could stack new weight on that barbell and see my body grow stronger. See what new things it coukd do. See how much stronger I was mentally and physically. Something you can do is much more courageous and important than someone you can be. You can be naturally beautiful and thin but looks fade with time. However, if you push through school and get a good job you can pretty much use money to buy many of the things you felt you lacked growing up poor (makeup, dental care, clothing, etc). You can have no mental illness but not have the coping skills when something happens that requires you to overcome it. You can have mental illness and have the skills through cognitive behavioral therapy to recognize negative thought patterns and stop them from escalating. Taking the time to learn and strengthen skills is courageous as hell. What your father thinks and says is a reflection of his character, not you. I grew up in a home with narcissistic parents. They commonly comment “You’re too skinny. You need to eat more. You draw your eyebrows on too dark. Your hair looks greasy. Your hair is too blonde. You’re too pale. You need sun” my mom was this way from abuse and is better now. However I got to a point of just saying “Well I like it. That’s why I draw my eyebrows on in that color.” My mom literally didn’t think I looked good last year when I went platinum. I draw my eyebrows on in a slightly darker shade than my brownish blonde natural shade. And I like that look. My mom tried to argue that your eyebrows should match and no one does them like mine. So I literally found 10 photos of platinum blonde celebrities that have dark eyebrows and she hasn’t said anything since."

The people who would be the best leaders in power want nothing to do with it.” I find the same to be true for having children.

https://hiddentribes.us

Their report write up is really interesting and there’s a quiz you can take that actually tells you what your hidden tribe is.

First time I took the quiz during the conference I got “Traditional Liberal” but I would like to do it again and see if that has changed:

{11% of Americans

“I think some people’s situations are challenging, and no matter how hard they work, they can’t get ahead. That’s why I don’t like the Republican Party. They don’t want to help. I think some kinds of people need help, and the government should help them.” 73-year-old woman, Texas, Traditional Liberal

Traditional Liberals reflect the liberal ideals of the Baby Boomer generation. They maintain idealistic attitudes about the potential for social justice in America, yet they are less ideological than Progressive Activists. They also are not as intolerant of conservatives. They have strong humanitarian values, and around half say that religion is important to them. Traditional Liberals are significantly more likely to say that people “need to be willing to listen to others and compromise.” They are the most likely group, along with Progressive Activists, to handle conflict by “getting to the heart of the disagreement.” Overall, Traditional Liberals respond best to rational arguments and are inclined to place more faith in the viability of American institutions, even if they are disillusioned with the country’s current direction.

Main concerns:

Leadership and Division in Society

Compared to the average American:

*Thirty-six percent more likely to disapprove of President Trump (93 percent v. 57 percent)

*Eleven percent more likely to handle conflict by “getting to the heart of the disagreement” (68 percent v. 57 percent)

*Twelve percent more likely to say, “The people I agree with politically need to be willing to listen to others and compromise” (73 percent v. 61 percent)

*Seventeen percent more likely to say, “We need to heal as a nation” (77 percent v. 60 percent)

*Eight percent more likely to say that to be American it is very important to “believe in freedom and equality” (75 percent v. 67 percent)

*Eight percent more likely to be over the age of 65 (28 percent v. 20 percent)

*Seven percent more likely to be white (76 percent v. 69 percent)

*Nineteen percent more likely to have graduated college (48 percent v. 29 percent)}


Edit: retook the quiz and got Progressive Activist. Don’t relate to any of it. I think my opinions are skewed right now because of the craziness of the Covid situation and policies of it being handled globally. Like I said. If anything i feel like a moderate and on the political compass quiz I tend to get libertarian slightly left of center"

funny,fouozbb,t3_g9l7mz,1588087986.0,"This has nothing to do with old vs new technology. It’s because some federal statistical programs that capture economic data use data from the state UI systems. These programs exclude things like gig workers and 1099s because those aren’t covered under UI law. Since there are new laws including those workers, they have to build out a separate UI system to accommodate those workers and keep those numbers from throwing off the traditional economic data (which is super important right now). Secondly, the systems are strained not necessarily because of old technology but because there’s a large strain on servers at one time. The most people m applying for UI in a single week throughout the history of the UI program will do that. Has anyone recognized that their Netflix, Comcast, online game servers are going really slow, too? It’s everyone at home using more of the server and bandwidth that is normal. It’s not just the government."

Not only is the sub you’re talking about biased it’s also pretty misinformed about the things it talks about. I don’t really want Trump or Biden this year. It’s really disappointing. I would love to have Cuomo. I know many love him and many hate him but I respect him as a true New Yorker. He gets up there and tells it how it is and he just emanates good leadership.

jobs,foqtzjk,t3_g8mkrz,1588000796.0,"I think this is something to really mull over. Don’t just jump ship and swim towards it wide open. The problem right now is that very few companies are hiring. Even when quarantine lifts many people working from home may not be called back. I have a roommate that has an associates in networking. He’s a network engineer and makes close to $80k. Right now he’s getting paid to play video games because their work projects have decreased. He always thinks he’s fine because he’s in tech, but as an economist I’m wary that he will be. It doesn’t matter that tech is high demand or can be done from home. The ability to carry out work from home doesn’t matter if there is not enough work to do from home. Companies won’t take a loss forever by paying employees for work that doesn’t exist. Eventually someone gets laid off. 

After the financial crisis, many people who became unemployed went back to school. They took out student loans and lived on those. Depending on the degree they came out with, many found it easy to get an entry level job. 

However I’m not sure how that will work out now. For one, colleges are closed and many students are doing class online. I don’t know how long that will work but it is messing up many students’ financial aid since the laws/requirements for federal aid disbursements are pretty strict. I also personally find that in most cases college can be a waste of time. This varies of course as many jobs require at least a bachelors now. It’s a complicated story but college wasn’t really compatible with my learning style and I came out with students loans maxed out. I enjoyed the experience of college but find it to generally be a waste of time if you want to work in applied sides of an industry rather than continue on to graduate school to focus on theoretical stuff. 

For stuff like tech I’m a fan of self study. There’s plenty of resources out there that are free. Before you go waste time on a computer science degree or a boot camp, start teaching yourself programming and see if you even like it. Spend hours consecutively coding and learning coding for some time and see if you still enjoy it. Some people like to look under the hood and push up their sleeves. Others will get frustrated and exhausted by programming pretty quickly. There’s nothing worse than investing a ton of time and money into something and then realizing you hate it. 

If you do like it you have to figure out what you want to do. Software engineering, back end development, web development, computer engineering, embedded software engineering, systems analysis, iOS and Android mobile development, database administration, data science and analysis, etc. That pretty much determines what language you should focus on. 

Many people will say to just pick Python because it’s widely used and easy for beginners. While that’s true, some languages are more useful for certain things than others and you should choose a language that aligns towards your end goal. Once you’ve learned one you can transition easily to another. So, while Java is notorious for being a pain the butt to learn and use, its a language demanded over Python in certain jobs. If you want to do data science, machine learning, or DevOps scripting then Python or R is fine. If you want to develop backend solutions for large corporations or develop video games then you should look towards java, or even better C or C++. 

If you want to do any kind of DevOps or system engineering you won’t go wrong by learning Linux. Don’t let it intimidate you because it’s not hard at all to learn and if anything (in my experience) it helped me learn way more about Windows and OS X than using Windows and OS X did. You’re looking at average salaries in the six figure range once you get experience under your belt for Linux experience. A lot of stuff runs on Linux and many companies keep Linux servers and have a demand for someone experienced to work with them. 

I started with R a long time ago then switched to Python for work automation projects and recently C for fun. Started learning command line and Linux back in January and love it. It still frustrates me though lol. 

TL;DR Find out what your end goal is. What do you want to do? Choose a programming language. Start teaching yourself and see if you even like it. If so build up your skill set and try to find a job. Only go back to college if you are 100% unable to progress in your career without a certain degree."

You may have to trim the fat and eat rice and beans, cut out cable or Netflix bills, etc. But there were people in America doing that daily before this whole thing happened. So hang in there and try not to stress and worry yourself ragged. I know it’s hard, but there is a light at the end of this tunnel. Were just waiting to turn a corner up ahead and see it shine down to us."
Coronavirus,fonw7sp,t3_g85wnx,1587927684.0,"I’ve been thriving. Haven’t really noticed any depression, fatigue, etc. If anything I’m doing much better since I don’t have to wake up at 5am and get home at 5pm due to a daily 2 hour commute. 

I know it’s stressful for those that live at home, live in a small cracker box of an apartment, can work from home and have kids and spouses, have been laid off etc. I 100% sympathize. But talking about extroverts vs introverts not in those specific or related situations, I don’t understand it. My roommate broke after 2 weeks and started hanging out with a friend. Just couldn’t take it anymore. I’ve always been a bit of a loner and could easily pass days to weeks in a row in my home and never get bored. I do programming, reading, tv, painting, building things, etc. As long as I can talk to people by phone, text, video, etc I do fine. 

I do empathize with everyone out there struggling, though. We will all get through this. Watched a press conference by Cuomo yesterday where he reminded everyone that the Spanish Flu lasted 4 years, the Great Depression lasted 10 years etc. We’ve been in this for about 60 days now and they don’t think any of this will last 4-10 years like those things. Stay strong, everyone."

Coronavirus,fogemkr,t3_g772vd,1587751596.0,"When I saw this last night I couldn’t believe it was real. I thought, “This has to be fake.” But it wasn’t. So I laughed. I laughed until I was in tears. Not because it was funny, but because it was. Because you can’t make this shit up. I mean, I think back to Bush Jr. and he was pretty stupid sometimes, god love him. But even he had enough common sense not to ask or say something like that on tv if he wasn’t sure. Hell even Forrest Gump would have enough sense to say “I don’t think that’s how that works” even if he didn’t know WHY that doesn’t work. Even Reagan who many people didn’t like for his austerity measures at least carried himself with Poise and Class. Then we have Trump. An absolute clown that I can’t believe hasn’t managed to kill himself by doing incredibly stupid and dangerous things. Maybe his parents put a helmet on him when was a kid and had a lot of child protective stuff. I don’t know. I know he makes the Bush Jr. days seem like a long lost paradise. Remember when everyone thought Bush was stupid? We’ve set a new marker here. I’ve never in my life under three administrations felt so uncertain, anxious, misguided, and left for dead than I do right now. I feel like we don’t even have a federal government up there. It’s almost as if every seat is empty and the states are all having to try to collectively stand in for the federal government. Jesus Christ. If any book perfectly describes the absolute terror of what we’re being forced to suffer through right now it’s The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis. What is the fifth risk in the book? Project Management. You can think of the government as managing large portfolios of various projects that keep our machine running. Keeping nuclear missile heads from falling, the census gathering demographic data for policy decisions, the CDC managing pandemics, the BLS gathering economic data to help the Federal Reserve set interest rates. The fifth risk that keeps civil servants up at night is project management. The perils of poor project management in the federal government."
southcarolina,foaoq9y,t3_g633kn,1587650075.0,"SC expat in Colorado. Still have family in S.C. so I keep up with the news. In CO they’re trying to figure out what to do. Some things they’re considering is mandatory summer school, school year round, cutting all curriculum except for core classes, holding students back next year by default. I’m not a supporter of standardized testing and there’s a lot of evidence over the years that has suggested it’s detrimental and a waste of time. As a worker I’m kind of enjoying this once in a lifetime experience to finally work from home and get to see loved ones and pets more often. I was already putting in an accommodation request at work before this due to health issues. A year and a half ofbwaking up at 5am, commuting two hours per day, and averaging 5 hours of sleep each night was starting to break me. I just wish they would let kids and teens be kids and teens. Stop trying to shove too much down their throats and let them learn what interests them for 20-30% of the time geez. Not everything needs to be standardized. Let them read a book that interests them and write a paper on it. Let them find a way to implement a math problem. Also realize that some parents are low income and don’t have internet at home. They’re also essential and have to work so they can’t patrol their kid and make sure they’re doing things. They’re working to get kids here internet and laptops. In the meantime let things chill out. Missing things here and there isn’t a big deal. Worry when the kids have missed 1-3 years straight."

learnprogramming,fo0knzg,t3_g4nd5g,1587414855.0,"Well, I have an Econ degree and I just like learning command line/Linux/Programming in my spare time. Programming is language learning. I’ve always loved learning languages and I always wanted to learn languages no one else picked (Portuguese, Arabic, Swahili). Language was taking control of something and building something from nothing, using it to do something for you. But language is also art through novels, poetry, etc. Programming to me is the same. I like troubleshooting, pulling things apart to see how they work, looking under the hood, challenging myself. I’ve always been fascinated by computers and how they work. I have friends that paint for emotional and creative expression. For me that’s what programming is."
