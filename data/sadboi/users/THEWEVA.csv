3Dprinting,fper816,t1_fpeqoon,1588553223.0,"Depends on the paint and the type of PLA. For acrylic paint on a softer surface print like something silky, either patiently do multiple layers (let them dry) or sand it first for better adhesion. In this case, the wood filament has a rougher matte like surface so the paint applies well. Hope this helps."
3Dprinting,fpdxn3y,t1_fpdrwc1,1588536288.0,Thanks! I printed with wood grain PLA which helped the paint stick better because of its matte like texture. I started with a lighter brown and got darker as I went using paper towels to constantly wipe the paint to make divots and cracks a darker shade. The trick with this paint is to have it dry before applying a second coat or else it won’t adhere all the way and look uneven. Thin layers are the way to go in short.

I’m an arborist apprentice so I gotta make sure my bodies set to go or I’m out for the count. Eat a good breakfast because you may feel sick if not.
