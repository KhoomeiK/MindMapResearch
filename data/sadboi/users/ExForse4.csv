Price for a grey item that 67 items then you need to have L√ºck to get your time which is not common getting always that one item. I get a vendor every 5th run or so and thats not always for an item i need which is 25 energy, but you want the energy for you item events too.... what i want to say with this its not possible in 1,5 month (basically if you get lucky you can get the item you need but its very rare as a normal drop tho, so I wouldnt rely on getting it that fast.) but if you are on it then go for, post an update im excited for that grind."
