books,fr0ntlq,t3_gly2dw,1589801886.0,"**Sweets: A History of Temptation by Tim Richardson**

I really wanted to love this book, but I didn't. The Lucky Dip sections are excellent and feel like what Richardson really wanted to write, but the rest is bogged down with some fairly dry history. The hunour comes off as smug and there's an overall feeling of someone who is is far too pleased with being the world's first 'international sweet historian'. I think he should have written a memoir about sweeties, rather than a history book."
