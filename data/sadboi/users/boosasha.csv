ptsd,foi7lu9,t3_g7cq8i,1587780391.0,"Like a horror movie playing in the background constantly , one which you don’t want to watch / see / hear / the only difference is , is that it wasn’t a movie but it actually happened. 

You do everything to distract from that noise , it eventually numbs you, cognitive decline ensues , 4 years later you’re slower to think , sometimes it feels like you can’t form a sentence in your head .

Disassociation - “ did that really happen ? “ / “ what if that was just a bad dream ? “
/ “ did they exist even ? “ / “ do I exist ? Does the world exist or is this just a simulation ? “ 

Crying - you cry everyday for 3 years , you cried so much that at times you didn’t even realize you were crying until you feel your tears sting your skin. Crying becomes second nature .

No sense of time - you don’t feel the linear sense of time , like how it’s suppose to feel - no past, present , future .... it’s all happening all at once ...to you time is cyclical ... you’re anticipating it , although it already happened...or did it ? 

When you’re triggered you get surges of heavy chest pain, tension headaches, nausea, general malaise . Over the years , if you’re lucky like me, it becomes chronic - daily .

Forgot to mention - bad panic attacks .

Recurrent Nightmares - haunting and taunting you . When you’re suppose to escape a bit through sleep ... you can’t some nights . 

Falling asleep .. staying asleep .. your standard 4 hours broken sleep .. you get used to it after 4 years . 

You’re a zombie . Soulless . Like going to a dentist and your mouth is numbed . You have no appetite for life anymore . Your tastebuds don’t even work . 

Thinking about suicide seems like the only thing that’ll give you peace."

Is your mom religious too ?

Day 3 - no word yet from the self-righteous 
“ man “ of the house . He just “ subliminally “ leaves the Bible/s open on select pages , scattered around the house ...where its just so conveniently open to verses mentioning the “ rapture “ - judgement day - end of times - people who don’t accept the lord are foolish etc .

🤢 yesterday he gave me dirty looks ... for what I dunno ? Oh yeah .. I forgot ...he’s trying to scare Satan out of me .

Edit : forgot to put .. 

fucking asshole.

I don’t think he intentionally wanted me to have a panic attack, he can just be unfortunately an inconsiderate, religious idiot."
ptsd,fne91od,t1_fndzh5y,1586885183.0,"Thanks , I wish I could explain to him but he’s not from the generation where he’s willing to learn or even listen. He is a narcissist like someone said here.
I don’t actually talk about the trauma In real life either because it usually ends up in me getting a panic attack."

I could hear him peak through my door then walk carefully to my bed ...I lifted one eyelid because I heard him whispering a prayer... his hand and arm was extended out over me. His eyes were closed. Lmao.
He must of thought I was worshipping my school project-made Bob Marley poster ... because the next day after school , it was gone from my room."

My dad : “ it’s the truth “

Me : “ no.. that’s your truth “

No sense in trying to knock sense in someone who has no sense to begin with. 

It’s like going on a merry-go-round of pointlessness. 

I tolerate his Christian freakness well . It’s just what he did the other day set me off and as a result I’m having stronger ptsd symptoms.

I still consider him a good dad, despite his religious filter. He’s just so fking stupid..he has no brain to think for himself ... relies on the “good word” of the bible . Reciting proverbs to any problem. 

Sometimes I wonder what kind of relationship I’d have with him if he wasn’t such a condescending religious freak.

Usually, any “issue” he has with me would be met with a phone call to his pastor . I would eves drop and listen ...
They would speak holier-than-thou gibberish and pray-pray-pray🙄

“ I mean fuck if the kid wants to be called max, call them max- it's not hard. “ 

Lol ! 
I’m glad to hear you as a parent can tell your mom to fuck off for disrespecting and dehumanizing your kid. Its nice to hear your kid has someone to stick up for them. This is so important, especially from a parent.

It’s my dad more so though, the power-trip a lot of these religious imbeciles have makes them feel superior to downplay their low self-esteem and /or whatever the fk underlying issues they have. 

Either way, both my parents are ignorant. 

As my mom was fanning me down mid-panic attack...she kept saying :

 ...”ok..ok ... that’s enough , that’s enough now ...ok that’s enough... stop now “

So to her I was having a temper tantrum...

Ffs.

Later I hear her talk to my sister on the phone...

“I’m going to have a problem again, she’s like that... she’s going to be depressed again “


I hide my depression , and I never vocalize it, complain, or openly cry around them, i’m lethargic but I still do my part in the house, cleaning, cooking, etc. sht.. 
“ depressed again “ ... 

God forbid I become “depressed again “.
