AmItheAsshole,fpdy92d,t1_fpdy1wh,1588536636.0,i just know how adoption works. and how? i said adoption is a long process. but we don’t know what went down in their house? there’s no way this kid had no idea or any sort of preparation for the adopted child.
AmItheAsshole,fpdv3me,t1_fpdtmew,1588534837.0,yeah but we really don’t know what happened in the house. i highly doubt they said “oh btw we’re adopting a sister for you today”. she knew ahead of time.
AmItheAsshole,fpdhjhm,t1_fpclr82,1588527109.0,do you not realize adoption isn’t just finished in a damn day? that takes just as long as a baby to born.
eatingdisorderstories,fmjcmdh,t3_fv75w5,1586127592.0,I’m sorry but you should not post this here. This is very triggering.
eatingdisorderstories,fm1tu6y,t1_fm1tm07,1585684901.0,"It’s okay. I’m personally not too bothered but I’m just thinking for others. And I know how you’re feeling, but coming from someone dealing with this, you can’t do recovery without professional help. I’m sorry, I know from experience. I tried to fix myself on my own and it only made it worse. My honest advice that I would push for you is to get professional help. If you need to talk to anyone I’m here. I still struggle daily"
ChoosingBeggars,fm1nntd,t3_fs9rfk,1585681711.0,He’s an asshole. Period.
eatingdisorderstories,fm1n7v7,t3_fs31us,1585681476.0,"Listen to me, I have an eating disorder and recovery was the best thing I could’ve ever done. I’m recovering and am so much happier and more free than ever. I think you really need to get some help. Also posting this was a bit triggering to people who are on recovery. You do NOT need to weigh yourself every day!!! Eat!!! No food is bad food, it’s all just nutrition. I would highly suggest telling someone and seeking help. Recovery is so much better than living through the hell of an eating disorder. I hope you can get the help you need. You do not need to lose weight to be beautiful!!! Weight is just a number. When I made my mom throw away my scale I felt scared, worried and hated myself a little more but in the end I felt so much freedom. Eating meals will make you maintain weight. Weighing yourself in the morning you will always weigh less than in the evening whether you eat or not. Scales aren’t even really accurate. Please seal help!!!"
AmItheAsshole,flef1vs,t3_fo5nns,1585083151.0,NAH. just plain gross. Use soap.
AmItheAsshole,fl2pbnn,t3_fjc9lp,1584756519.0,You’re the side piece.
AmItheAsshole,fl2nle3,t3_fcz0jg,1584755310.0,You’re basically stemming eating disorder behavior in her head. Not cool dude.
AskReddit,fkjcejd,t3_fiqjog,1584241958.0,Seems like an “innocent” way to cover up a beastiality fetish.
AmItheAsshole,fhqtkgx,t3_f4cvyw,1581811194.0,YTA. Why do you give this much fucks. It’s just an Instagram account.
love,feamk06,t3_eo1u4h,1578950312.0,there’s no such thing as a honeymoon face if you’ve found the one.
EatingDisorders,f9ocklw,t3_e5fidv,1575501355.0,seek help. that’s my best advice. i tried to get better on my own but was in fact getting worse. you should reach out to an eating disorder recovery place.
EatingDisorders,f8gv1ls,t3_dzzbis,1574565512.0,You should probably start seeing a therapist before it gets out of hand. Talk to your boyfriend and tell him you don’t appreciate the comments he made. Admit to yourself about how you’re feeling. Please seek professional help though. I’ve had an on and off eating disorder for about 2 years now but it just got worse this summer and i dropped weight really fast and stopped eating. Now i stay at a hospital during the day and sleep at a hotel instead of my home at night. My advice is please be honest with yourself and seek professional help. Whether that be a therapist or recovery center.
EatingDisorders,f512717,t3_dmhkpq,1571936193.0,Definitely not alone. I do this too.
LifeProTips,esljwm7,t3_c88axi,1562086961.0,"When I look at someone at the gym it’s for 2 reasons.

Number one: I am envious and tell myself that’s what I want to look like, run like etc. 

Number two: I am noticing their efforts to exercise and am subconsciously proud of them and cheering for them secretly in my head. 

People DO look but it’s not really out of judgment. We all are there for different reasons. That’s the beauty of people watching at the gym."
loseit,esl7azj,t1_esl6wui,1562080524.0,Even if I don’t get to 115 lbs. somewhere around there would make me feel so much happier about myself.
loseit,esl75xp,t1_esl6wui,1562080452.0,I’ve been eating healthy meals like chicken with some vegetables and having fruit for breakfast. My height is 5’3 ish. I’ve seen that it’s a healthy weight for my height. Also I know that eating is the more important factor.
