SuicideWatch,fpq60f7,t3_gen4q2,1588815863.0,"I could have written that post at your age. First off I’m so sorry you’re going through this. No one is born deserving the kind of aloneness you are currently experiencing. But I promise it won’t be forever. Absolutely promise. Call me out on that if you want. Things will be okay for you but it will take asking for help. That’s the first step, and you’re already doing it. Do you have a teacher or counselor you can trust if not your parents or close family? You could write a note to the teacher you think is nicest and will care the most. Now is a good time to be shown proof that people care that you’re hurting. I know there is a feeling of shame or failure when we ask for help. But the truth is it’s the most sincere and authentic thing we can do for ourselves when we are hurting. Truly the right thing, and yes it’s hard. I hope things settle down soon and you find the help you need. And remember that mental illness is real and needs attention like a broken bone would."
