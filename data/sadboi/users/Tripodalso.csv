And perhaps you will be afraid about walking with him again, or wonder if you can ever trust him. I think it is wonderful of you that you want to give your dog a better life though than his father. But it can sometimes be really difficult and incredibly hard work. 

It looks to me like your dog did exactly what he was bred for. Protecting his humans and livestock. These dogs are bred to think and decide for themselves without consulting their human first. In this way, his behaviour is 'normal'. As a human, you will have to be the one to channel his behaviour into acceptable forms within the society where he currently lives. If you, or your parents, want to use this dog as a serious guard dog for your property and be a pet as well, he must be taught to understand the difference. It is possible to teach your dog to experience walking with you as off-time, not-on-the-job. The best way imo is when you can convince the dog that you are now on-duty, on guard, and therefore he can relax. But this could mean quite a burden on you, you will have to deliver, otherwise the dog will take over again.

If it is possible for you to work on this with a professional trainer, that would be really good. There are trainers who specialise in guard dogs. Not walking with him will only make him more and more difficult with strangers, it is reinforcing."

Dogtraining,fj7g3qb,t3_fbluf9,1583091177.0,"Classically, when one dog puts a paw or his head over the back of another dog, it is related to social status, dominance behaviour like you say and something you don't want to happen. But in practice, I see this behaviour happen all the time and eventually leading to play (my practice as walking with dogs among other dogs, not anything professional).

I myself always look at a combination of signals from your own dog ánd the other dog(s). The mild growling is it from your dog? How does the other dog respond? What happens after? What about the position of the tail and the ears of your dog? Etc. 

By GSD do you mean a German Shepherd? Because they are guard dogs and sometimes have a tendency to think they need to ""police"" other dogs (and people). It helps a lot if you take the ""guarding job"" on yourself and the dog can start to feel like she's off-duty when among other dogs.

Focusing on you is very good, also really convenient when your dog is off leash among other dogs is a good recall. And when you are in doubt about how the meeting of your dog with another dog is going, call her and move on. I myself don't want to take a risk. It helps if you find other dogs to play with that suit your dog's personality better, learn about your dog's type and help find her suitable friends.

Bottom line: just one signal is not really enough to judge the behaviour, in my opinion."

A few years before the psychosis I was very ill physically, and almost died. I thought that was shocking. But it was not really compared to the psychosis. After my psychosis, I stopped going to my cardiologist and vascular surgeon because those things now feel so ridiculous compared to what happened during the psychosis. Things that were important to me are now no longer. I have a lot of anger, but no place to go with it, a deep sense of being powerless. The point is: it changed me on a core level.

So what I have found helps me, the only thing that works (but I am open to other ideas), is to find an affirmation and use it whenever the bad voices bother you.

Have you tried a larger northern light, so that it better fits with the water part? Or the sky 2/3 and ground 1/3? Well, either way, it feels like the light is too small."

At the moment it helps me to make a deal with myself before I go to bed: my alarm clock goes off at 7, but if it's too difficult then at least hold on to 6, and definitely NOT before 5. One midnight break is allowed. If all this doesn't help I allow myself one diazepam per 7/days tough.."
