buildapc,fr12wae,t3_gm27g6,1589812200.0,"First thing you want to do is set your budget and your goals for the PC (is it for gaming only or are you planning to use it for professional creative work like video editing?). Setting a budget will limit your choices and will make the next steps generally easier. 

Than you would want to pick out the parts you want to use. A great place to start is this video from Linus Tech Tips -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfcschg9uwU
Basically they show recommended parts for each budget category. You can either copy their build or tweak them a little bit. Ofcourse they're not perfect, so you might want to read reviews for each component you're considering putting in your build. The great thing about building your own over buying a prebuilt is that you have TOTAL control over the parts you're going to use.

You can use this site -> https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ to start creating your parts list. Then you can post them here to hear other people's thoughts on the build.

If you've got the time, I highly recommend reading the beginner's guide in this subreddit's sidebar."
buildapc,fqzwpt4,t3_glun5z,1589777296.0,Please pick an SSD. You WILL notice the difference. I recently switched from an HDD to an NVME. The difference was night and day. I felt like a had an entirely new PC even though I didn't upgrade anything else. Even a cheap SATA SSD would be faster than an HDD. For a cheap NVME SSD I would recommend Crucial P1.
buildapc,fqwc7cr,t3_glavgy,1589699310.0,"If your goal is future proofing then I recommend waiting for Intel's 10th gen. Their new processors WON'T be compatible with the 9th gen motherboard in your list (i.e. you'll have to also buy a new motherboard if you decide to upgrade your CPU in the future).

But as another commenter suggested, I would also recommend going with Ryzen. Look up any of Linus Tech Tips videos on Ryzen on youtube. They do a good job of explaining how much ahead AMD is on Intel right now."

depression,fazhw1d,t1_fazb81d,1576416280.0,"Hmmm photography I guess. I bought a pretty decent camera last year. And have actually recently gone to a few indie music gigs to shoot some photos for the bands I like. I actually legitimately enjoy doing that even if I'm doing it alone (I almost always go alone). I like the pictures I take (even if I never share some of them to anyone) and I enjoy listening to the music. Some of my vividly happiest moments this past year was doing exactly that. I don't get to do it as often as I would like though.

Come to think of it I actually like doing a lot of things alone. I like shopping alone. I like dining out alone. Someday I would like to travel alone. Maybe I'm just built that way? To live life solo. But even then. I still feel an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Even with the company of friends (w/c are also coworkers, as my only non-work friend os always unavailable and has stopped checking in on me)."

All the pain and all the loneliness will someday seem so small and so distant. You just have to wait it out a little longer. Make it your goal to just get through the day. Thats it. You don't need to do anything extraordinary or special. Just make it through the day. One day at a time. You will get through this.

And if time passes and the pain still doesn't go away, you need to start treating what you're feeling for what it truly is: a chronic illness. An illness that is treatable as long as you take the steps to treat it as such. Go to a doctor and take some meds, like how one would treat any illness."

I'm convinced I got it from my mother. Whenever she made a mistake, however minor, she would always make a remark of how stupid she is. Sometimes she would bang her own head with her palm.

I was still young then. I didn't think too much into it. I just thought that all mothers are like that.

But today, I'm sure it played a large role on why I have a hard time being nice to myself."

FoodPorn,eq30ivi,t1_eq2y0wi,1559747442.0,"u/ramses0 is right, it's cooked in a frying pan with some butter in medium heat (note 'medium heat', since butter will burn in very high temperatures).

Basically, heat the pan for a few seconds to half a minute, put the butter in the pan and let all of it melt, then put in whatever you'll be cooking (in this case, the french toast).

French toast is one of the simplest but most delicious things you can cook, I highly recommend you try cooking the normal version, if you haven't yet."

FoodPorn,eq2cd2c,t3_bx0qro,1559733803.0,"You'll need:

* Bread slices
* Nutella
* Eggs, beaten
* Butter, at least 1 tbsp (up to you really, I personally like big chunks)
* Optional sweeteners like sugar



Flatten the bread slices using a rolling pin (or any smooth cylindrical hard object like a water glass).

Spread one side of each bread slice with Nutella then roll.

Lightly dip each bread roll in the beaten eggs like what you would do in a normal french toast. You can add some sugar or milk into the egg mixture if you like.

Melt the butter in a pan in medium heat. Cook the bread rolls until one side is brown (might take 30 seconds to 1 minute). You don't need to brown the entire surface of the roll, just two sides will do.

Be careful with overcooking!! My first batch smelt too ""toasted""."
