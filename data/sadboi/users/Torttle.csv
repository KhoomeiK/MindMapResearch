NoFap,fnpnjlg,t3_g33or3,1587148634.0,"If she also says no she is a hypocrite. Everyone is allowed to not date someone for any reason, that’s fair. If you don’t like someone’s occupation and don’t want to date them for it, that’s fair. Point of relationships is to build your own relationship with someone in which you both agree and disagree on enough things to where you’re comfortable. Being stuck up would mean not only would you not date someone but you actively pretend like you’re superior to them and that they’re beneath everyone else, so it’s possible to not date someone for their choices and still respect them"

NoFap,fbv7kyr,t3_eeiju9,1577126804.0,"Porn doesn’t make sense... for a hetero person who favors monogamy, it doesn’t consistently match up with also enjoying seeing other people banging. However the fact that porn is a media form portraying strangers, it helps to distance the viewer from real life action, allowing them to *suspend their belief* and imagine themselves in the strangers position. This is the most logical explanation to the experience of watching porn while wanting a monogamous hetero relationship. Too much of this may lead to personality problems. A person may change their personality entirely, or maybe lead double lives, resulting in confusion. Seeing dicks banging a woman you like while being straight male is really gay."

I was happy with her for 7 years and I would be with her again if I could go back in time. But I remember that I wasn’t the man she wanted me to be, I was not heading toward a stable career and all that, so she left me. I still want her to be happy, and if that doesn’t include me then it’s gotta be this way. I gotta respect her over everything else.
