bestoflegaladvice,eyx0zqf,t1_eywwu8h,1567542377.0,"It sounds to me like they were trying to get out of paying the temp agency's fees while waiting for the background check to clear. ""Well we're offering him a permanent job anyway, why should we have to pay the temp agency X on top of the guy's pay rate in the meantime?"" The bill rate owed to the temp agency can be as much as double what the actual temp worker gets paid."

Geedis,eqpkt9i,t1_eqohx4k,1560200913.0,"I know exactly the type of eraser you're describing! There were a lot of those white erasers cut to the shape of whatever image was printed on it, they tended to be characters rather than objects. But yeah they were so awful that when you actually tried to erase something nothing much would happen, so you'd press harder, and that would make a big chunk snap right off lol.

&#x200B;

I don't have any Geedis eraser memories, but I do of the stickers. Need to post about that at some point."
