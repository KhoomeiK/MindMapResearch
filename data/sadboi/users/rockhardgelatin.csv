You continually fail to provide legitimate, unbiased sources to substantiate your claims on the subject of public utilities. Many of the sources you do cite are either off-topic, misleading, or solely from personal experience, which, if you don’t have any other perspectives from which to draw on and adapt, can tend to be pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things. 


Regardless of your complaints about Pueblo, you have benefited from the changes over the past few years. You’re upset now because a potential change in how our community manages public utilities could have less of a benefit to you than it does the community as a whole. The work you took on by installing solar panels on *all of* your properties might be reduced in your eyes if everyone had access to the same affordable rates and good quality of service. 


The reality is that we all need to work together to ensure that everyone in our community has access to the things that may set us apart in social status; not just the things that benefit us as individuals. Transportation, housing, food, water, electricity, and internet access are all essential things that are required to live a productive life in  current, mainstream society. That’s not to say that people don’t have successful lives otherwise,  and that their contributions to society don’t mean the same thing, but the majority of people benefit when we work towards common goals.

You present many false equivalencies here, so it’s difficult for me to take your comment seriously, but I will respond nonetheless.


Don’t feign a pity party. The point of municipal utilities is to ensure that everyone in your local community (i.e Pueblo as a whole, not just you and your household) has access to the utilities that people require to live daily life, at a realistic and reasonable cost. In our society, this includes electrical, water, and broadband utilities at the very least. Learning to live under stay at home orders makes this more evident than ever.


First and foremost, we are talking about human beings, here. The whole “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” theory is a myth. Not everyone starts out on the same level, nor has access to the same facilities and social connections that many people enjoy and require to meaningfully progress on a financial level. Yes, hard work means a lot, and you can achieve a lot through it, but the level of work you put in does not equivocate the same social status for everyone else who puts in the same amount of effort.


Your boasting about putting solar panels on your houses and not having to pay anything to Black Hills is fine, but it doesn’t do anything aside from boosting your ego. While I am glad you made the financial decision to install solar panels, because it does help the environment, using it as a tool to defend privately-owned utility providers is a self-defeating mission.


We all deserve to get what we pay for when public services are concerned. We deserve to have a voice in our legislative process and vote on these issues. The only way that happens effectively is if people play a part in the progress — not just lay back and complain to everyone else about the things they don’t like but might actually have the privilege to help change. 


If you don’t like a policy, vote against it. That’s your right. 


What you, in particular, seem to be doing is trying to convince people that they don’t have a say in their local government, or that they don’t have any control in local policy-making. This is not true in any sense if people take the time to participate. That is why we have ballots in our mailboxes right now...specifically so we can have a choice in how our utilities are managed."

Xcel is private investor-owned and not even an example of public utilities. Thankfully, they are being regulated by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Stop trying to casually mislead people on this matter.

puc.colorado.gov is the website for the Public Utilities Commission. Here’s their Mission Statement:

“The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) serves the public interest by effectively regulating utilities and facilities so that the people of Colorado receive safe, reliable, and reasonably-priced services consistent with the economic, environmental and social values of our state.”

They are an oversight body over utility providers to try to prevent private companies like Xcel and Black Hills from completely taking advantage of us. And it gives individuals in the community an option to file complaints against these companies and participate in public commission hearings regarding utility rates, infrastructure needs, etc.

True public (publicly-owned) utilities are run on a non-profit structure, and the local community has much more say over rates and infrastructure improvements because they don’t have to fight with a board made up of private investors whose only concern is their profit margin. We would actually vote on how our local utilities are run and any rate increases that could be imposed, instead of just being told about them when a private company decides your money isn’t enough to line their pockets anymore.
