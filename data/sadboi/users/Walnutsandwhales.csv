bipolar,fct2xlv,t1_fcsyhs7,1577931495.0,"I get this urge too. If Iâ€™m at home or somewhere else I can give into it, I will just stop and sit down. Sometimes in weird places too. And, like you say, I just detach from the world or kind of retreat inside myself? If Iâ€™m not interrupted I can lose hours this way. Then once I come out of it, Iâ€™ll have no memory of what I was thinking about, but this incredibly intense nagging of wanting to remember, like when you wake up after a dream. 

If Iâ€™m somewhere I canâ€™t just stop, it takes all my focus and energy to push myself to keep moving, and I feel overly drained and exhausted.

I had to send something similar to my excoworkers, but struggled to be so open and honest. Even so, they all were so loving and sweet about it. I really missed them too, so it meant a lot to me.

I am also a people pleaser, and that's exactly what happened to me recently. They kept piling things on me, and as a perfectionist too I would push myself harder and harder to make them exactly what they wanted. I'm really artistic and a good designer, and people always seem to take advantage of me, my talent and my niceness. I have a constant list of things people have asked me to design for them as favors.  The problem is that I actually deliver when I'm manic, which makes people keep asking.

As someone who stopped dating for many years due to depression, I'd say give him a chance.  Take it slow, and he may need you to make a move every now and then.

Teachers,f8c03r4,t1_f7xeh97,1574449314.0,"I love this and totally agree with you. I actually already have a pretty solid idea for a program that would allow teachers to easily customize for a class of any size with about 30 different options for student materials, equaling hundreds of different ways to customize. I'm thinking for use in moderate to high special and any gen ed/inclusion class.) 

Teachers would enter their class roster and either fill out a short survey for every student or give a super short assessment to each student (ideally there would be a technology tie in so maybe online.) 

Then the program would automatatically customize student materials for every lesson. Maybe print 10 lessons at a time, then go back and change options as needed. Is the student extremely slow or do they rush? Less questions? Higher level questions and more of them for gifted students? they able to read(at what level?) or does everything need to be in pictures? Can they write independently, do they need to trace or should everything be picture based? Dyslexia font? Large text/small text/space... you get the idea. 

Ideally this would all be tied in with UDL strategies and students would be moving/acting and interacting as parts of every lesson. I envision lots of hands on materials that are ALREADY MADE and well organized so it is extremely easy to set up for every lesson. Maybe the program could even come up with ideal student groupings based on abilities (with personality input available because everything should be customizable.) I would ,over it to also include materials for leveled independent centers.

The program could possibly even customize the lessons for each class makeup. Change the delivery/length/number of breaks/ primary learning style etc. Nonverbal/talkative/antsy? Change it up. Maybe even offer a scripted or non scripted version for teacher preference. 

There would definitely be a slide show component that has picture/visual instructions and keeps students together and also allows the teachers to follow along as they teach. 

I really think this sort of program would help in cities like mine where over 70 percent of our students are 2 or more grade levels behind by 3rd grade. The curriculum just isn't reaching them and there is way too much for teachers to do. They ask for data-driven modifications but don't give us the tools/time for it all."

I also live in a largish city that has a HUGE vegan population, so there is literally at least one vegan option at 95% of the restaurants here, so I can easily and happily share food experiences with guys. If they make the plans I tell them not to even think about it.

My ex and I used to go to this one place all the time where we both loved getting drinks and the vegan buffalo wings app, but then I'd get a vegan entree and he'd have a bacon cheeseburger. I just don't think you should totally avoid vegan because you think it will be too hard. Even TGIFridays has a vegan burger lol"
