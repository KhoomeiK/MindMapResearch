depression,fblimcf,t3_edsmnj,1576963451.0,"I really hope this is something that passes and that one day soon you will find things to look forward to and other reasons to stick around.

You said yourself it makes you sad to hear other people say the same, and that's how your post made me feel. It sounds like you're a caring and empathetic person and I really genuinely hope that you can use that side of you to find meaning in life... Maybe your calling is to help others that feel the same?

 If this is how you really feel then I hope it's just a card you're keeping in your back pocket for when you're old and just feel like your time has come, but I really wish you can stay around for a long long time and let life take it's course.

I'm regularly active on this account if you ever want to chat mate, am wishing you all the best."

depression,fb5u0ws,t3_ebgvd3,1576534327.0,"For what it's worth, just try and remember that most people don't understand the severity of depression and what you're going through until something happens like a suicide attempt. It doesn't mean they didn't care beforehand, it's more likely that they didn't understand and/or didn't know what to do.

I know the above is not a popular opinion amongst us that go through depression, but I've learned to be able to see things from other perspectives a lot better over the past few years. I think by nature we who get depression are extremely caring and empathetic people, it's one of the reasons the world gets us down, bit it doesn't mean others don't care at all. Take care mate, I'm rooting for you."

If you can't do it right now that's perfectly fine, but just to make it easier on yourself try following the above pattern. Again, I believe that you're capable, but you won't let me down if you can't, it's perfectly okay."

depression,f7pvrdg,t3_dx9yqx,1573955151.0,"It's human nature to want to be productive, but to also have leisure time. Being productive can mean a lot of things, though... for some it's as simple as having a job or studying, and for others it might be a more tangible and direct contribution to society either through work or through personal time.

In any event, boredom and not taking pleasure in leisure activities is both a classic symptom of clinical depression, and also completely normal when other aspects of a person's life are unfulfilling. If you aren't already doing so, this is a great topic to speak with a psychologist about.

I was in the same funk, and still am to a small degree, but with medication, a great counsellor,  and getting into a new industry that I enjoy so much more than my previous job has helped a lot."

I was fairly popular in high school but had a hard time making friends at uni mainly due to studying part time, but my job helped to supplement that and i still have some good friends from that time.

I really only have 2 close mates in the city I live in, most people from high school are busy with kids and their work, but I play a team sport and multiplayer online games which gives me a bit more social interaction and that definitely helps. I'm not sure if you enjoy any sports but team sports are an awesome way to ease loneliness. I'm almost 40 and can't move as quick as I used to but I'm glad I returned to baseball, even if I am now in the seniors league XD Maybe try looking online to see if there are any social groups nearby that have a relation to something you're interested in?

Edit: Congrats on pursuing your postgrad! That's something that looking back now in hindsight, would have been a really good option for me."
