Since most parents would mentally, even unconsciously, associate their child with the other parent.  The resentment could be totally like the Pavlov experiment.  Being reminded of the cheating spouse would hurt and over time, you'd resent your child for triggering that hurt. Again, feelings/emotions aren't based on facts or logic a lot of the time."

I still have a lot of Lyrica from back then, but I have been too afraid to try it recreationally because it messed me up so much.

My point is, being a therapist won't make you instantly know what to do or how to do it.  The reason many people have therapists is to have an unbiased voice of reason, and in certain moments, it can be impossible to be that for yourself.  Don't be too hard on yourself right now.

Most importantly, don't forget to validate and allow your feelings.  You are worth your care as much as your clients are, so when you feel up to it, try some self-care.  For now, getting drunk isn't the worst thing you could do.

I am not a therapist, but feel free to message me if you want someone to talk with.   If not, that is very understandable and I wish you luck and healing."
