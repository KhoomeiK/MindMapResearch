Went to get the kid some milk but he tossed his cup and it burst open. It was the last straw. I went to put the child in his crib so he wasnt in the way and didnt get injured on accident. Went and got a second cup of milk and when I went to get him out of the crib I knocked it over and it broke open again. I was so pissed I was literally shaking and nearly spilt the third cup of milk. I snapped at my spouse and told him to fucking do something about the upset child. I was then even more mad by the fact that he acted like I beat the kid.
