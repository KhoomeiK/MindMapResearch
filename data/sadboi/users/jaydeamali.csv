Guests need to be respectful about what the couple wishes regarding the wedding day. If the couple says “no kilts”, guests really should respect that. 

I see it all too often now that people seem to think that the day is about them and not the couple. Too much complaining about things and less focus on the bride and groom. And people wonder why the bride and groom get upset on their special day. Ugh."

What gets me is that people are saying shared space is for shared items only. I call BS on that. Because by that logic, all fridge groceries are shared too. I don’t care if you got those vegetarian sausages just for you since you don’t eat meat and I do, even though you told me they were there AND you bought me regular ones too just to be nice. They’re in the fridge so I’m gonna eat them anyway. Oh, you didn’t want me to? Okay. There they are again, gonna eat them again. Giving me a third chance? Okay, gonna break out my grill and cook them up, then eat them right in front of you. I know this isn’t an accurate reflection of what’s happened here, but it’s the best I can do. 

Now tell me OP is in anyway TA here. 

OP asked politely for roommates to respect her sentimental stuff. I could understand misunderstandings if, and only if, it stopped after the first time. Using her stuff right in front of her, and only her stuff, means that the roommates were never going to respect her things. So rather than let that habit continue, she just packed up ALL  her stuff and locked it up. Roommates just learned an important lesson in respecting others property here."

Any dog that doesn’t behave properly and the handler doesn’t immediately correct the behavior means the dog is probably not a service dog.  It infuriates me to see people bring their dogs places and say it’s a service dog when it’s clearly not. Most places are just terrified of getting a lawsuit that they won’t ask people to remove the poorly behaved dog.

The application, the reconsideration appeal, then the hearing appeal. You can go further than that, but a lot of lawyers won’t go that far.

Your way of phrasing it wasn’t so good, but she should be doing the bulk of the work. However, maybe not all of it. There are still things that need to be done when you’re home too, like dinner dishes. Maybe switch off on those. I don’t know what she’s gonna do once the kid starts school though. She’s gonna get bored during the day pretty quickly unless you’re planning on homeschooling your kid. Now, if you do that, remember that she’s taking on a full time responsibility of teaching as well as being a SAHM. That said, she can’t just sit there and wait for you to get home and help with all the household chores. I’m sure you could do a little bit once you get home though.

We always make sure it's okay with the other before having any pic posted anywhere. One person says no, and it's no. My ex won't even let his current wife post pics of our child out there without me knowing where it is. That said, neither of us have had to ask the other to remove it because none of us have creepy men leering after any of us.

I'm really concerned for that 6 year old's safety with pics online where men leer after an adult female already. Not saying any of them are pedophiles, but you just don't know that. It's too much of a risk to take with a child that isn't even your child. You may be step-mom to be, but you aren't mom. Mom has a problem with this. Respect that. Even your fiance seems to have a problem with it. Just take them down and think of it this way: You aren't hiding this child, you're protecting her."

I just stared at her for a moment before shaking my head and starting to drive off. She got in front of me and started screaming that her kid needed it more than I did. Her kid was maybe 3 years old. I finally just sighed and told her that her toddler didn’t need the cart as he wouldn’t be able to drive it. I barely got inside the store when I overheard a security guard telling her to leave. Apparently she’s been banned from the store before because she let her kids go wild on the carts.

TalesFromYourServer,exheic3,t1_exf4cak,1566302851.0,"I’m known to speak my mind when I get bad service. Not verbally, but in the tip. That said, I have only gone below 10% once. It was a god awful experience. There were only 2 tables and 1 server. Both tables were heavily ignored. We both got seated around the same time (we got there first and the other table was about 2-3 min behind us). We both waited 15+ minutes for the server, and that was only because the other table asked the hostess about where the server was. At one point, we saw the server outside the front of the restaurant, smoking with her buddies when she should have been getting our food from the kitchen. I know this because after she came in, she fetched our food. It wasn’t cold. It wasn’t hot either. It was kind of warm. We did say something but we were largely ignored. It was also the only time I ever pulled a Karen and demanded a manager in a loud and irritating voice. The server claimed no manager was on site. The hostess, who knew us cause we were regulars, went to get the manager, who also knew us, though not as well as the hostess did. I only complained about the temperature of the food. Nothing else. Now, we always liked to sit and play trivia (buzztime trivia) or poker. So we were there a couple hours at least. This server refilled our drinks twice, then dropped off the check and ignored us for the rest of the time. Fortunately, the manager was already aware of the problem and took care of us after we got ignored. I left no tip when we were done. Never saw that server again. 

The best bit to this story is that we were known by our trivia names. So every time we changed the names, the staff would tease us about how they had to relearn and remember the new names. At the time of this story, I was Jedi and my boyfriend was Sith. So imagine the hostess going to the manager. “Hey, uhh, Jedi and Sith need to speak with you.” That is one conversation I would dread."

entitledparents,eoxlhvj,t1_eoxlfnu,1558925620.0,I do go there from time to time. Mostly shop at Walmart though.
entitledparents,eoxldna,t1_eoxl8cv,1558925569.0,Yeah. They closed down before I had a chance to go.
entitledparents,eoxl6pa,t1_eoxl4zs,1558925500.0,Never actually went to one.
entitledparents,eoxl06s,t1_eoxkxgr,1558925427.0,Yup. Howdy!
entitledparents,eox4s6i,t1_eox4r74,1558919059.0,Yup
entitledparents,eowqu4n,t1_eownu5i,1558913574.0,"There are things I won’t let my almost 17 year old do for herself as she has severe anxiety and major panic attacks. For example, I won’t send her into Walmart without me going too because I know she’ll break down completely. She can go into small stores though without problem. That said, she can go to the bathroom for herself, thank you very much."
entitledparents,eownc0d,t1_eown4gp,1558912178.0,Lol. Hadn’t even thought of that. It’s too much muscle memory now.
aww,eowbneh,t1_eowbm9l,1558907670.0,It will. Eventually.
aww,eowbjam,t1_eowbg4h,1558907624.0,This was posted 59 days ago. Since then we have lost our home.
entitledparents,eow8s6u,t1_eow7r2v,1558906552.0,"If you ask me, it’s a lack of discipline when these Karen’s were growing up. During the 80’s and 90’s was when the whole Time Out phase began. My parents never gave me a Time Out. If I didn’t behave, I either lost stuff (like my Commodore 64, Nintendo NES, or other that I liked) or I got spanked, depending on the severity of what I’d done. I turned out just fine really. If someone had done that to these Karen’s, we might be seeing a whole lot less of them."
entitledparents,eow7i6u,t1_eow6ukk,1558906064.0,Shouldn’t lose karma for asking. Whataburger is a chain in Texas and a couple other southern states. It’s kinda like an upscale McDonald’s really. Better food but also a little more expensive.
entitledparents,eovti5j,t1_eovsni6,1558900451.0,"Everyone does it from time to time. Sometimes it’s nice to have a little extra space. Even though I use it out of necessity, I always try and keep my trip short just in case someone else needs it after me."
entitledparents,eovt8na,t1_eovsfwq,1558900339.0,My apology was actually spoken sarcastically to her. I’m pretty sure it had the effect I was going for since she didn’t say anything else to me. Dunno what tirade probably happened after I left the bathroom.
entitledparents,eovpuq8,t1_eovpj02,1558898910.0,Everyone does. Doesn’t really bother me when people do. I’ve waited once for someone who was changing clothes. There’s no way that could have happened in the smaller stalls.
MUD,eovnyks,t3_bta2nn,1558898149.0,Tossing out another. Ragnarok. Rag.com 2222. There’s a small but dedicated player base.
entitledparents,eovlw8r,t1_eovlj03,1558897272.0,Didn’t think you were. It happens a lot in public bathrooms. I’ve seen some really nasty ones. It’s why we stick to the whataburger one. They check it regularly and keep it clean.
