That room you and your wife are in does nothing but provoke anxiety and the security guards are right outside the door watching your every move yet won’t advise anyone of your growing discomfort. The QE2 is the worst place to go with a mental health complaint. 
I will be thinking of your wife and hoping she can go home to rest."

Whoops, sorry buddy! Not that big of an issue for us but I can see it causes you some trouble. As I was saying, the parking ban system should be a little bit more refined but we all know the city banks on this. 
Thank god this is only temporary for all three of us!"

halifax,fhangry,t1_fha0xoy,1581419496.0,"Maybe you should look at the amount of places available with parking let alone the amount of affordable places.. I could list reasons such as the fact that because my address is on one street, I can not buy a parking pass for the street I have to park on... my fiancé walks to work downtown so we have to be close, we had paid parking but it costs 120$ a month.... 

Maybe we should move farther out and get two cars? 

With your logic only people that walk would live on the main peninsula... clearly you’ve never owned a vehicle and you should think critically before typing. Or at least think."
halifax,fh8vjm1,t3_f1td51,1581368242.0,"After the parking ban last week I woke up at 430 am to go to work and there wasn’t a lick of snow, slush, rain, nothing. The roads and sidewalks were all bone dry. So I had to walk half an hour each way to and from my car for fuck all. What a service. You’d think after decades of Nova Scotia weather the people in Nova Scotia making these calls would have invented a little bit more of an intricate system. But why do that when you can complain about the state of the skies ~4 times in the run of a day as a pass time?! 

I’d also like to know more about the exclusively nocturnal behaviour of the elusive city snow plow."

Did any of you ever stop to wonder how people from hours away get to their job in this city? Not everyone has the luxury of walking to work. In fact the vast majority of workers in this province commute. 

So blow it out your ass because the automotive industry runs Nova Scotia."

Driving consists of many variables, a lot of them weather and light dependant. Try to think about this when crossing any street. Lots of types of people drive, there are many types of vehicles with different levels of wear on their wearable parts. Also things to keep in mind. As a driver I am constantly aware of all of these things and I act with precaution when I’m a pedestrian in the city because of it."

Anyone get good auto yields with LED?
