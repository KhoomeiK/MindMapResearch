SuicideWatch,fdzs58k,t3_enakk8,1578794512.0,Yeah. But then I always disregard my personal health/hygiene/future prospects. Whats the point getting work when i'm not going to be here in a days time. Whats the point showering when I am not going to be here in a days time. Whats the point worrying about weight gain. I'm not going to be here in a days time. The same questions I ask myself and I always get the same responses. This is has gone on for years.

worldnews,faoy0hh,t3_ea3tkm,1576275184.0,Honestly at this point as someone who lives in England. Go right ahead. Having to deal with all the world making out as if I am a racist tyrant who hates foreigners who oppresses the poor Irish Scots and welsh. I am done with it. You guys can stop complaining. The world can stop demonizing me. And everyone can just fuck off and do their own shit.
AskReddit,f9v6qnw,t3_e719kg,1575664107.0,"York city in the UK. 'The Old Fireman' A chap who walks around town in a Victorian fireman's helmet and attire, He has some sort of mental problems. He just kinda walks around mumbling to himself and occasionally sucking his thumbs."
YangForPresidentHQ,f8n97dl,t3_e11wle,1574640651.0,"I am not an American, nor do I live in America. But I do believe in Yang and his ideals. Coming from the UK which currently is in incredible political turmoil, the most emotive part which really stirred emotions for someone not living in America was the ending. Just the last-line when he said 'It's going to be all right' That was like a warm cup of cocoa next to a log fire. I felt a sense of hope and stability in my political world which is so fractured and bitter. I hope Americans start with this election and snap back against the bitterness and hate that has gripped many western democracies (including my own) and help push the world in a direction of Humanity of hate."
