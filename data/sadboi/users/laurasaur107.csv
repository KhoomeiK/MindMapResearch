witchcraft,fqmnptm,t3_gjnlod,1589480492.0,"Lol. What someone calls themself is up to them and only effects them in the end. In their craft they call themselves baby witches and that looks different than your craft and what you call yourself. Which as you stated is good. People use it as a way to say they are new to the world of witchcraft and that they are growing as they learn. Most know that there is no endpoint to witchcraft and the study. I have never called myself a baby witch and i would never call someone else that if they haven't stated thats what they feel they are, but if thats what they like/are comfortable with thats fine. It harms no one.

I do agree that trying to get an answer on your own should be the first step and the longest step, not just jumping to ask someone else the answer. But a lot of the time mediating doesn't help if you don't know the answer to the question (if the question is fact based or anything outside of intuition-based)."

AmItheAsshole,fpofrwg,t3_gedpbg,1588783755.0,"NTA. 

My birth mom also got pregnant from a dude 10 years older as a teenager. Except he got her into drugs too. She gave me up for adoption since she knew she couldn't provide a good life for me. Luckily I have an open adoption so I get to know her and she is part of my adoptive family now. My parents sent him adoption papers for me and he sent them back unfilled after he told all his friends that there was no way that bastard child was his. 

I also call my ""father"" the sperm donor. I understand how you are feeling. But you need to do what is best for you. It matters less than nothing about how he feels about it. You need to put yourself first. You have a mom (and a dad even if he isn't the best) and thats all you need. Maybe one day you'll meet him and maybe you won't. But that is a decision you will have to come to in your own time. Him pressuring you is only going to hurt his chances of ever meeting you.

My boyfriend told me he wasn't happy and that he was breaking up with me on Saturday. There was no big fight or anything we just sat on the couch, hugged tightly and he wouldnt let go for a bit, and then went into different rooms (we live together). Then the next day I left to see a friend and had to run back up and when I opened the door he was sitting on the couch crying. I kissed his head and left. Then the next day his brother came to help him move some of his stuff out. I put a note in his front flannel pocket and told him i loved him and hugged him again and he hugged me so hard and had his hand on the back of my head rubbing his thumb back and forth and again he didnt let go for awhile. I kissed his cheek when I left and he did that big gasp when youre trying not to cry. 

&#x200B;

And I keep telling myself that those things meant something. That he probably needed space because he is 22, has one year of college left, got three professional theatre job offers (which he wants to be), and his mom is purposefully scaring him to come home during this virus thing saying he will run out of food and money up here. So I have been lying to myself saying if I dont reach out and let him process everything he might realize it was a mistake. But I just keep reliving those hugs and that kiss and thinking there is way more to it than that.

You do realize that if the shot protects against strain A, that the other strains are still infecting people, but A would be protected against. Yeah its a bit of a gamble, but its a safer gamble than any odds actually gambling. 
Having had the actual flu, the prediction chance is worth it. The actual flu is so much worse than the stomach bug people think it is. One sucks, but youre okay a week later. One makes you wish for death."
AmItheAsshole,f3u46mf,t1_f3u2zyi,1571152551.0,"you realize you CANNOT get the flu from the shot. It is impossible. You did not get the flu after getting the shot. If you feel sick afterwards thats because its your immune system is doing its job. If you do get the flu (not the stomach bug/cold that people think the flu is, but the actual can kill you easily flu) its because they predict which flu strain will be the worst that year."

Rewatched it for the first time in a few years for personal reasons and realized that I have basically molded half of my personality from Evie. I’m getting my masters to be a librarian who is unhealthily into history but I’m also not afraid to fight someone."

Gorgeous yarn though. You said it was Lion Brand?"

Libraries,f2fibkp,t3_ddamss,1570218213.0,Did no librarian help in designing this? Accessibility is a huge thing for almost all librarians. Well the ones worth anything at least.
AmItheAsshole,f2f8ftn,t1_f2f82lg,1570212898.0,yep. For some dumb reason it is 19 in here in Nebraska. I had a friend who had a child at 17 and could take him to the doctor and make appointments and everything but still had to get her mom to sign off on her appointments and such. kind of ridiculous.
suggestmeabook,f2ewxv8,t3_dd7sk2,1570205529.0,"I say do it. i have done it even though Im technically speaking closer to Wiccan or druidism or whatever, tbh I just really like nature and find the rituals of things comforting dont really believe in the whole magic thing. I just wanted to learn. I actually need to go reread it since I read it only once when I was about 12 or 13 in a study bible.

Keep in mind that some things are vastly different in each translation; some of which are done on purpose. For example, in the Kings James bible it says ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination"" except in most old Greek bible it says something more along the lines of you shall not lie with a *boy*. Because in ancient Greek culture homosexuality wasn't really a thing. Everyone boned everyone. Preteen boys would have older male lovers who were also their mentors until they were of an age to marry and then they would marry a woman. So they were saying dont have sex with a young boy because its rape."
Sims4,f2ew2u6,t3_dd2uax,1570205058.0,I for sure thought this was posted into r/buffy for a second. At first glance it looked like the Master bathing the anointed one and I was very confused.

I reread the entire Dresden series twice in the year it’s been since my best friend killed himself. I tried reading grief books and it made it worse because then you are just focusing on it and focusing on it. 
Your grief will always be there. But having something else to think about/do is good for the moments the grief feels like it will smother you."
