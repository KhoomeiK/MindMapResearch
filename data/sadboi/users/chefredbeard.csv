Billionaire,f029k0t,t1_eysjr5y,1568326204.0,"Spoken like a privileged, pompous dinosaur brain. Your value judgement, ""thieves are bad and evil"" is just that, your value judgement, not mine. People steal for all kinds of reasons, if your starving, stealing food doesn't mean your bad and evil, only that your hungry. It would seem you have made an overly broad and weak generalization in your poor argument. Hence, the pompous and privileged tags. Then in your next effort, you build a straw-man argument and attack it. Common mistake while attempting to recover from a poor debating stance. However, I don't regard the generally excepted notion of a disappearing middle class as ""probably based on a few experiences"" which is a vague, inaccurate guess. 
Clearly, you lack even the basic skills in self reflection and armed only with remedial reading skills you have become a boring adversary for debate. I will learn nothing from you and you aren't capable of considering anything that doesn't conform to your Fox channel propaganda based belief system. It's time to terminate your failed attempt at learning.
Bye."
Libertarian,f027n1t,t3_d369qu,1568325002.0,"The statement about overreach of the government is a classic example of tunnel vision libertarian thinking. By utilizing a little inductive analysis it would be easy to see that arguing the government can't get involved is also championing a position that its OK to make a profit off of harming people. Worse, the self-deluding argument posted by others that vaping has saved millions of lives is even more ridiculous. It takes approximately 30 years to die from smoking on average and vaping is killing people in 3 years so with simple math it appears that argument is 10 times dumber."
Billionaire,eysi2ot,t1_ey0a5gr,1567398965.0,"Wow, thank you for reiterating all the conservative talking points of trickle down economics that has been in place since the '80s. But your reading skills need some work. I did not say that billionaires were bad, evil people or that they robbed others, these were your interpretations. I implied that while their financial transactions were technically legal they were also morally and ethically corrupt. And they were aided in that corruption by bribing politicians.
Mitt Romney during his presidential run always argued that his financial dealings at Bain Capital were legal but never addressed whether transferring employees pension funds to Bain Capital to pay fees was moral or ethical when asked.
Clearly you have bought in to the propaganda of our economy giving everyone an equal chance. It doesn't and has been corrupted in to a Monopoly board stratagem of winner take all. Hence the concentration of wealth not seen since the robber barons of the 19th century.
The rest of your arguments are non sequiturs that don't merit a response."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,evjhcen,t3_cjxb1q,1564562512.0,"The first thing I noticed was that friendly smile and kind eyes. It wasn't until I read the title that that I noticed some slight asymmetry. My wife was involved in a head-on car crash and had some significant facial trauma, but after the swelling and stitches were gone after 3 months I realized that I never really noticed the scars or changes to her nose any more because when I looked at her I saw who She was, the person I fell in love with, not her changed facial features. The ability to see people for who they are rather than just what they look like is less common in the teenage years but becomes more common with age. So hang in there it will get better. Life has challenged you to become a person of outstanding character, something truly needed in today's world. And I hope you get there still wearing that beautiful smile."
AskMen,euep5tg,t3_cfwkk0,1563750108.0,"I can relate to the risk-taking adventurous side you describe and have also worked in multiple countries pursuing business dreams. However, I think you have overlooked or minimized some significant issues.

First, there is a large amount of randomness(luck) to career success. Unless you can see the future, knowing what technological advancements are going to nullify current business opportunities and displace entire industries, or who is going to leave or retire creating room for advancement, or what mega-corp is going to decide to kill off an upstart company rather than buying it, you are subject to the randomness of fate. Obvious examples are Xerox and IBM. Xerox, a group of moronic paper salesmen that hired the best and brightest academics to invent the office of the future that included object oriented programming, Ethernet, mouse/desktop/icon user interface, and full page editing instead of command line interfaces. This created Apple Lisa and Mac's. Or IBM, being too lazy to enter the PC O/S market and contracting it to Microsoft and then allowing MS to retain the I/P. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were in the right place at the right times and then were smart enough to exploit it. Not accepting the significance of luck in these situations is akin to believing all lottery winners are mathematical geniuses.

Second, for the last 35 years most American industries have been in contraction except for software. As a consequence opportunities within those industries have become fewer and harder to come by. If you don't realize this it is easy to measure your success expectations against a distorted index that literally doesn't exist today. The off-shoring and automation of 80%+ of US manufacturing has been devastating to opportunities in manufacturing based industries. The software industry has lied about the availability of ""qualified"" candidates by substituting the term qualified for cheap. Thus allowing them to import hundreds of thousands of programmers and software professionals from India, China, and Eastern Europe via tech visas and depressing opportunities and salaries in that industry. And, to put a little extra salt in the wounds of those competing in this market, almost all immigrants from China and India come with zero college debt.

Lastly, would you trade your family for better career success? You may have instinctively chosen opportunities and made decisions that protected your families well-being while selling your own career opportunities short.  I don't consider this to be stupid career decisions, I believe them to be admirable traits for a family man. A man's (person's) worth is not what he does for a living, it's what he contributes to a future society. Climbing socioeconomic ladders, amassing personal political power, or gaining hierarchical titles may reinforce one's own sense of accomplishment but in and of themselves do very little to the betterment of society when compared to raising well adjusted kids."
relationship_advice,etdjwdt,t1_etbjo3f,1562708281.0,"Clearly your self projections in this topic are fueled by some great personal trauma and the enthusiasm with which you engage in these topics is a denial mechanism to avoid the self healing work you need. Hope you get help and heal those emotional scars.
Peace"

relationship_advice,et94bam,t1_et8vur3,1562585267.0,"The implication you are stating did not happen, I merely warned against utilizing his siblings against his father was a bad idea since so many replies had stated doing so.
His dad has not yet ""ruined"" his life and your highly charged responses are a dime a dozen in this thread and do nothing to aid him in his future.
Your extreme desire to share in someone else's emotional trauma illustrates an emotionally unstable, needy individual that needs help themselves, so good luck with that."
relationship_advice,et8x9mw,t1_et77lul,1562574921.0,"Sorry for the confusion but I did not suggest you use your siblings for anything, only that trying to influence them one way or the other ultimately achieves nothing to better your life situation. And I do have great empathy for your situation. Most peoples introduction to the stark reality of adulthood and the unfairness in life is usually revealed gradually over about a decade or 2 on average. Unfortunately your introduction has occurred with all the subtlety of getting t-boned by a dump truck.

My advise was intended to help everyone in your family focus on your future and not your Mom's transgression of your Father's trust. I believe if your situation is presented in the context of the future you deserve, then it will focus everyone in your family on their part in what is most important, your future!

Greatness is forged in the fires of adversity and clearly Life has some high aspirations for you. Having a goal( a college education), a plan to get there(an amalgamation of advise from your thread) and taking steps to achieve your goal will go along way in helping you to deal with your emotional injuries and perhaps your families as well."

relationship_advice,et8uybl,t1_et8p9ch,1562571419.0,"Yes, it is very cold. This wasn't intended as a holistic cure for emotional injury.  It was a logical suggestion of a best course of action that would create the greatest opportunity for OPs future."
relationship_advice,et8u2an,t1_et8nh1z,1562570188.0,"This is great advise if you don't care about the OP's future.

relationship_advice,et767fd,t3_ca66sv,1562525662.0,"I'm an old fart and an engineer so my advise to you is don't fight the situation you are in, it's happened. Turning your siblings against your Dad only destroys the only family you have ever known.   
Bear with me on this as it starts out unpopular with the rest of these threads. Instead, problem solve it. It's what engineers do. Tell your father you will abide by his decisions and since you are not his biological child he should not bear that financial burden.

However, he was party to the knowledge and does bear some responsibility for this train wreck of a situation you are in with no time to prepare or find alternatives. So ask him if he will at least help you reach a livable solution and help you with school loans which you will repay in the future. Tell him you are trying to deal with this situation as bravely as he did when you were born and follow the example of the only father figure you have known.

Good Luck."

However, having lived in China I have learned to respect Asian culture when eating their foods such as slurping the noodles completely into my mouth rather than cutting them or biting them off which in Asia is seen as rude. So I say when eating spicy noodles go for it and tell your SO to respect your culture with your foods."
