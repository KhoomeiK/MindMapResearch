I wouldn't actually do that, since I don't hate her, I just don't care. I do hate my personal space being violated, and makes me think ""bold of you to search for compassion from me, try with another person, just not me, what makes you assume we're that close?, respect my boundaries, asshole""

I do not comfort people, I feel insulted by having on me the expectation to do so."

In 2010 where I live (chile) there was an earthquake and I remember the days following the event as happy childhood memories, no one wanted to stay in their houses, everyone out talking and kids playing. 

My little world felt more alive suddenly, and all it took was a catastophe to happen, to produce a change in routine. 

Yes I do think It's interesting to see how people react to things, it makes the news channel entertaining, like a movie you live in."

I thought I didn't like ""real music"" because I didn't like what my mom listened (mainly 80's pop), but I slowly got to know bands and genres that I clicked with, mainly prog rock and 70's music. That music really gets to me, makes me dream, and I listen to them whenever I want to feel:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR4aCz-JZrY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR4aCz-JZrY) Camel - Airborn

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roa3K2LeAZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Roa3K2LeAZk) Supertramp - Rudy

I think the 70's was a great time for music to be made, and yes, it is more about the melody, a good melody can make me cry a lot. I really dislike the concept of superstar or celebrity, like when their ego is what drives the music instead of the artistic expression.

I get excited when it comes to music, as you can notice. I wish I had someone to talk about it."

ELOcirclejerk,f7eccvf,t3_dvmwx2,1573653849.0,"bro this just sounds like bait to me, ~~(i'm not)~~ sorry. I would believe you if you had said you liked at least one album and gave a reason to why you don't like the other ones. I WOULD believe if you just said it's not your style, that you have different tastes and it's completely valid, but did you had to come to this subreddit and say it's ""not good enough""? And ending with ""not good as (bands I like)""? Through the years I've come to understand that the more music you listen the more you become open about your tastes, so liking very specific bands doesn't make you sound *C O O L ,* just immature and in need of attention. ELO is known to be a very influential  band of its time, I mean like, Jeff Lynne is a close friend of the *~~chooking~~* Beatles. Since we're on ELOcirclejerk I'll think of this post as sarcastic, because apparently you're well informed about ELO's discography and that would be a little unnecesary for someone who doesn't actually like their music.

\^my objective point of view

My personal opinion: I love Eldorado and Face the music, I prefer their early stuff over the more popular style of discovery and forward, though I enjoy it as well, hecking good music. I don't actually listen to The Eagles, but they seem decent enough. Too mainstream, blame me for thinking that. I've never listened to imagine dragons, they must be good I guess. BTS it's just a joke for me, it's not my style. I wouldn't dare to say ELO is THE best band, because I know too many too make them compete, but definitely a band to be remembered. (Hear me BTS will be forgotten in a couple years)..
