Ocd behaviour. Obsessive thinking, analyzing, stalking. Not being able to sleep or eat, depression, moodyness high n lows etc. Its horrible how all this started at such a young age...

I have grown up with emotionally unavaible and detached and often times
moody and near depressive parents.

My father was almost never there bc he worked crappy hours frm 5-22 (own bussiness with lots of heavy lifting).

He would only be able to spend time with us a few hours during weekends after 17-18 a‚Äôclock. He would be all tired though. 

My mother was always so unhappy. And her moods were always so unreliable. She could be all normal and kind one second and then something would set her off,  small irritating stuff would get her to react all pissed off. I would feel so embarrassed over her rage episodes. It looked so weird in my eyes as a kid.
I now know she was very depressed and irritated and angry. She still is and its just worse now with her age and constant body aches etc.

My parents could never know how to consoul and be positive and ‚Äùhug‚Äù things out etc. I see now as an adult how I behave exactly like my own mother and father, in general.

I never was a ray of sunshine type of person, how could I when no one in my family ever was or let me be that way?

Thankfully I had amazing friends during the ages of 13-18 and I know how to be genuinely caring and warm and how to show love and care.

And my parents are loving and warm people and did give us lots of love and attention! I learned how to show love with actions.
How to always be genuine and open with expressiong of feelings etc.

But often they would have detached ways. Warm and caring and then detached and cold.. hard to explain. Anyways I have always felt loved during my childhood. I have never felt unwanted or unloved by my parents ever. Only that I always wished as a kid that they could be more like...

Be empathic to your self! You just wanted to connect with this guy and did everything you could. If he acts dumb or weird this way, its not your fault. You can‚Äôt change a person into being  appreciative of you when its a person who is so self absorbed or selfish etc"

limerence,fd3w6k6,t3_ejx4ud,1578162184.0,we usually use limerence as a mood regulator when feeling down.  Or something substantial to focus on when we feel that void inside that nothing earthly can fill..

limerence,fd3vm56,t1_fd2cdt2,1578162017.0,"no I could never disclose it would have been a really bad idea in my case.

I keep myself away from guys now, unless its gonna be a potential for real  relationship/marriage.

Limerence is an addiction illness. Transference would be like quitting cocaine for heroine. From one hell fire to the next. I wan‚Äôt to get away from this fire and addiction..."
limerence,fd2ct57,t3_ejta0a,1578145361.0,"solution
1- find a partner you can marry or have long termrelationship or what people who wont marry each other call it.

2- stay away from men/females, especially if there is a ‚Äùglimmer‚Äù, of emotions like ‚Äùoh I like how he looks.‚Äù or ‚Äùoh I like his humore and he starts to grow on me‚Äù etc. Just, run if you ever feel a glimmer for others other then your SO.

Thats the only way. Limerence is an addiction. A sober addict won‚Äôt circle around cocaine or heroine and be like ‚ÄùI can contain myself‚Äù. You have to reduce all types of temptations. And its hard.

Avoid spending time with tempting people. Avoid lunches and talking private connecting stuff etc."
limerence,fd2btu0,t3_ejural,1578144937.0,"been there done that.  the feeling of feeling super connected etc. such an illusion.

for me it led to have such super high expectations of my LO built in the beginning when we just started to connect and then flirt and being affectionate. after around 6-7
months I started to realize, he was not ‚Äùalmost reading my mind‚Äù. He was not ‚Äùsoo super intune‚Äù with my emotions and feelings. It was all an illusion created by all the dopamin highs in the behinning. We had things in common but thats all.

after around 7 months the dopamin tresh hold was high, and it started to dissipate, thats when I started to see all his faults and that he was not ‚Äùreading my mind‚Äù etc... he was just a guy riding on the dopamin highs just like me. after that went away, we did not have anything anymore.

I tried to be ‚Äùfriends‚Äù with him for 2 years. It ended badly, with me being cinstanly weird and moody.. and him being moody or elusive. happy one day, elusive the next etc..."

Its normal for men (or females) to feel sexual attraction to others and to show it in one way or other. So he is attracted maybe and likes attention and feeling desired

You are simply addicted to the dopamins your brain creates upon being in contact with this ‚Äùnew‚Äù person. You are addicted to the feelings of ‚Äùnew love‚Äù and dopamin. And you have ocd.  There is nothing to open up to her about.

It will dissipate in a few months. The dopamin will be less and only ocd will be left..."

But it also depends on different factors, like do you have therapy? How are you processing all this? Are you processing shit our are you avoiding it?

Also I wouldn‚Äôt invite an LO to my wedding. Does your SO know about your LE?

If you try to hang out with your other friends do it one on one and not in groups. That way you can avoid your LO"

limerence,fcuiuh2,t3_eiqon3,1577981986.0,"yes of course. its an addiction so it does affect one both neurologically and physically.. I have even had severe anxiety attacks near panic attacks at the thought of never seing my LO again... Or everytime he mentioned his gf.

 For 2 years I went almost crazy over analyzing and ruminating every small thing I or he did or said or did not do or did not say etc. During those years I went from euphoria causing ligh headedness (in the beginning phase for just 5-6 months) and no need for sleep etc 

To anxiousness and anxiety where I had severe: Insomnia, loss of apetite and weight. Loss of interest for my hobbies. Loss of interest in my health and diet.

Focus problems that even led to me crashing my car in traffic. (The car got totalled)...  So yes physical illness is the norm with LE I believe..."
limerence,fcuimzb,t3_eitmfk,1577981847.0,"Have a look at the site ‚ÄùLivingwithlimerence‚Äù. There are sections about how to and if one should disclose to an SO.

Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt. Its an addiction bit its addiction to an other human, even if the person is an object for us limerent people. If ones SO had never been limerent they won‚Äôt be able to understand.

A third possibility for me was that my LO maybe did not take it seriously and thought I was just trying to reassure him so he wouldn‚Äôt be angry with me. My timing may have been bad, like telling him ‚ÄùI care very much for you‚Äù just after apologizing? He may have thought it was just me going over the top in order to say sorry. Anyways...

So Even if your LO wanted a different respons, Its  certainly not only because of that. There is a bigger context and history to it all right? I‚Äôm sure she knew this was not going too well and other things piled up. So no focus on the whole picture and story. Your reaction did not make it or broke it I‚Äôm sure of that..."

I won‚Äôt initiate any body contact or hugs etc if i‚Äôm not attracted. If I hug a male friend he most definitely is my LO...
limerence,fcihnom,t3_egw0av,1577662705.0,"how did you respond to her when she said that? did you acknowledged it?

I told my LO, who was my friend for a couple of years,  in text ‚Äú I care very much for you‚Äù while I was apologizing for something bad I ‚Äòd done.

Texting that was special bc I had never said anything like this to him ever before in words. We showed our care for each other with actions and had hard time saying it outloud or in text. 

His response was to not even acknowledge it. He said he did not take offence (for the thing I was apologizing for) and changed the subject and became short in his replies.

I took it as he was being elusive bc he had became to not like me anymore. Maybe he felt it was hard to reply to, and felt awkward, but it broke my heart anyway. After that I did not dare to write more and we did go NC. But there is a lot of history leading to the NC.
 It just was the last straws when he didn‚Äôt acknowledge my heart full words..

So how did you respond to her?"
limerence,fcfwy2y,t1_fcdbrm8,1577634487.0,"Excuse me but I have to correct one thing, 

Reciprocation is what starts my limerence. There are limerent people who have LO,s that reciprocates (though not limerent themselves usually). I for instance never gete interested or limerent if the person is not atteactive to me and attracted to me and reciprocates physically. But the barrier ingredients is also always there yes. For me it starts as a crush, and Only if the other person crushes back at me. Then it turns into heavy hot flirting and only if my person is trapping it up. Then it turns into ocd/limerence. Then we both start to cool it but my ocd thoughts will remain for years...

Thats the only good thing about my limerence episodes, that I never get limerent for someone who is not attractive and attracted not giving me physical attention and flirting etc back.

Compared with some persons I read about in this forum, where some seem to get limerent from afar just by one eye contact or on a celebrity etc...

I would say that this person is still my drug. He would still have a huge effect on me neurologically if I was to be in contact with him. 

Going NC has helped me get him out from my system (edit: more like I got a chance to Start to heal without seeing him everyday etc bc that would always kickstart things for me again.) 

 But I still think about him daily, but more like ‚Äúhow could he cut me off like this?! I can‚Äôt believe this‚Äù.... Its less and less intense now though. Like slowly fading. I still have a long way to go! And its not a linear process! Its a dynamic process where its ups and downs but lately I feel the ups and downs are less frequent and they are not intense anymore. 

It helps that I knew we would Never be in a relationship and also how he stopped showing care and warmth gradually in the end. And when we went NC I was so emotionally burned out and went through and emotionall hell. I don‚Äôt want him to trigger all that again.

I don‚Äôt know if my type are so uncommon but the only reason I become limerent with someone is because I‚Äôm lonely and in the search of a partner. Also I become limerent only if the person is flirting with and is attracted to me. Then I will get intruged and wanna ‚Äùwin‚Äù the person over some more.

My LO was very attracted in the beginning, then he slowed things down to more subtle flirting. Then when withdrawel and not getting enough kicks made me start to act like a crazy person and Bipolar and depressive, he started to seem to lost his apetite (gee I wonder why..)

In the end like 2 years after we met he was so uninterested, like he would wanna spend time with me but he was so detached.

 In the beginning he was such a sweet heart. A real charmer, always caring, giving attention following up conversations we had.
In the end he was an other person!
He would never follow up, he would never give compliments or hugs etc. He would upright lie to me and be like ‚Äùoh I did not hear you when you mentioned z, y etc‚Äù. When we infact had talked about it several times! wtf?!

In short it was like starting out as a loving couple and then like being in a cold unloving relationship where the guy had gone all detached and avoidant and the girl was acting all depressed and cold bc of that..  I couldn‚Äôt believe how we could go from what we were before to end up the way we did..



. it was horrid... and then when I thought it couldn‚Äôt be worse, he went NC on me just like that. And this is a guy who is super empathic and never wanna hurt other people etc ... I guess I was so limerent I projected my expectations on him.."
