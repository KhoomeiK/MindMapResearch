iRacing,fnrkt6j,t1_fnrkf7a,1587192147.0,"I haven‚Äôt restarted it but I shut it down for the night and tomorrow I‚Äôll try removing everything and doing a clean reboot. 

I was asked for admin permissions when the updates came through. Also, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an antivirus issue? It passed the inspection when it was originally downloaded and didn‚Äôt pop up saying there was an issue or any files were being quarantined.. but that‚Äôs a good point, I do have a few antivirus programs installed that I could try disabling on next download and installation.

Just a question, when you go into your installed programs via the ‚Äúadd and remove programs‚Äù tab does it have the iracing.exe file or is there multiple files that are there. I just think it‚Äôs weird they after the first uninstall, I looked on my desktop and found the UI as well as the website shortcut to the iracing members page almost as if it dosnt uninstall... this is just baffling to me honestly lol
 I do however, appreciate all the help you are giving me in my trouble shooting."
iRacing,fnrj9hd,t1_fnrj2ku,1587190690.0,I believe I got rid of everything I just went to al programs and uninstalled the only iracing program that was there... I still didn‚Äôt get rid of my UI app and the launcher. When I went to get rid of those they weren‚Äôt found in my installed programs. I have over 250gb free on my HDD and I think that‚Äôs plenty enough. It just seems like the whole installation isn‚Äôt working as it should. Like I said I‚Äôve been gaming on PC for years and I never had an issue installing a game like this
iRacing,fnrj1ut,t1_fnriws7,1587190496.0,Really? That‚Äôs really weird. I keep all my games on a HDD so I don‚Äôt bog down my C boot drive... I mean I‚Äôll try it but even if it works I would hate to keep it on that drive...

Don‚Äôt dwell on what it ‚Äúmight be‚Äù but focus on what you are doing now, which is making yourself better.

Think of all that you do have that you are thankful for (roof over your head, family, job, pets, plenty of food) I know it seems stupid but putting things into perspective really helps me. Always knowing that there is someone out there that has it worse than me makes me thankful that what I consider is a big deal to me can be so small in the grand scheme of things. I know that you can‚Äôt see a doctor right now but have you ever thought about online therapy? I know a lot of therapist are conducting online therapy sessions, maybe reach out to your doctor over the phone and ask if he/she knows of any in your area... if not a good google search might point you in the right direction! Keep your mind busy, get some exercise (if you can), talk to your friends and family, take up a hobby, read a book. I notice that when my mind is busy I forget about my troubles and things that are bothering me. No matter what,  just know you aren‚Äôt alone and so many people are struggling. Be strong you WILL get through this. Just keep saying that to yourself when ever you doubt it."

insomnia,flyrb0k,t3_frzl7y,1585607554.0,"I seem to have the same issue as you, insomnia, anxiety, depression. My dr gave me multiple different sleeping pills to try and even at the highest doses they won‚Äôt knock me out! ‚Äîscary... However, I started exercising, I walk, jog, and so something physical everyday to physically exhaust myself. I find this has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm not saying every time it will work but it‚Äôs been a lot better for me with regular exercise, less sugar, and caffeine in my diet. Also, I suggest listening to a podcast you‚Äôre interested in. I listen to history podcasts and just zone out and close my eyes and eventually I find myself drifting off... don‚Äôt over thing it just let your body relax. Try to limit the screen time on your phone and computer before you go to sleep as well, I find playing video games before bed makes it hard for me to get to sleep. I wish you the best of luck!

I hope that lexapro works for you and your anxiety, in my experience the best medicine for anxiety is learning valuable coping skills and breathing techniques that will make you stronger mentally. So if this doesn‚Äôt work don‚Äôt be discouraged! You are strong and you WILL get though this. I wish you the best luck, keep us updated (:"

When I get into the daze I think a lot and don‚Äôt even realize that I‚Äôm having such long thoughts in my head. With that being said I try to eat food to balance it out. With alcohol forget it... it hits you really hard, as someone else said the half life it‚Äôs really long so you have to be careful (obviously)  though I‚Äôve never ran into an issue as I take small doses to manage my anxiety."
benzodiazepines,fbum6m5,t3_eeihri,1577116745.0,"Yeah, I take them for anxiety and depending on how much my anxiety is bothering me the less it works.

Im not strong at math but I was able to get through calc 1 and discrete math without much of an issue. if you apply yourself and take use of campus resources like tutors, study groups, and office hours with the professor then you will be just fine."
