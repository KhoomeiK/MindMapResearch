Crisis averted!"
YoutubeMusic,fplixmy,t3_ge3trr,1588713539.0,"Just got it and also broken for me like everyone else here. No song title and no more next song, so I can't go to next track. 

Nice slow rollout.

EDIT: issue has been fixed! Yay ðŸ¥³"
Monitors,fp88llr,t1_foz8z4a,1588386237.0,"I am using a 24"" 1440p monitor portrait beside my ultrawide. It does help quite a bit. However, I don't like having to turn to the side so much to code, so I'm anticipating having it all in the 43"" would be nicer. 

Thanks again for the information. I'm very tempted to pull the trigger on this and this helped."

I really want to have the vertical space but I'm unsure about the resolution and how it works with that (I use 125 on my 34"" right now. I assume I will either do 125 or 150 like you).

FinalFantasyVII,fn6mn7h,t1_fn6ck4d,1586702942.0,"Not sure if you're using a controller, but the mods seem to cause issues with controllers. 

The D-Pad on my xbox controller wouldn't work and I could only use the sticks, which gets annoying when navigating menus.

So I downloaded something called Antimicro (https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro), which allows you to map keyboard to controller. The key is to **run as administrator**, or else it won't work.

Once you've done that, it's good to go."
FinalFantasyVII,fn5mjru,t3_fznpcm,1586669019.0,"I too am starting a play through of the original on Steam using mods right now to help take my mind off the remake :)

Luckily, the modding community just updated 7th Heaven to 2.0, and it makes it really easy to mod the game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9rBC7K0SYM

Just watch this video. And once you have it installed, there are mod packs already included. One of them will have remove random encounters entirely. There are a bunch of other mods that will make the game look better, if that's something you're interested in. So I recommend just downloading the mods and seeing what they do. You can pick and choose.

As for maxing out stats, you could use the black chocobo save editor and edit your save files.

Hope this helps. Cheers!"

GooglePixel,fhp3tg2,t3_f42jyp,1581781323.0,"I used an app called Fluid navigation gestures. When configured to swipe from right or left, it will pull the navigation tray down when you swipe from left or right edge of screen. This can work even with Android 10 gestures (just takes a little practice.). To work with Android 10 gestures, you have to run your finger down the edge and then sideways if you have Android 10 gestures enabled. After a few practice tries, it gets easy. 

You can even have a setting for long swipe. Which I set to multi task view. This way I don't even have to reach for the bottom of the screen. 

I pretty much use this all the time and actually prefer it to the fingerprint pull down now (takes a bit of practice though.)

Hope this helps!"
YoutubeMusic,fhl6sh7,t1_fhj9xtd,1581696180.0,"Yeesh. This is easily the worst issue YTM has. I can forgive nearly anything else, but mistitled tracks and all that is kind of a big deal. 

What's worse is some of these tracks are correctly titled at first. Then something happens on the back end and everything gets shuffled. So on my playlists it'll have a bunch of renamed songs. But when you play them, it's the old song lol...

They're lucky we are all so damn patient."
