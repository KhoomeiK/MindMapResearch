Psychedelics,f50nzrw,t1_f50m7tf,1571930299.0,Axiety level as of right now is in red alert. As I'm typing this right now my mind is thinking of fucked up scenarios. I'll take your word and maintain a clean pallette before taking shrooms. I'll do it the morning after tommorow. When it's almost sunrise. I have a trusty buddy that has a safe spot where we usually hang out.
