mildlyinteresting,fqpegl8,t1_fqoxiyz,1589544224.0,"Dear sweet Jesus,
 
I would say ""Raising cane's is love, Raising Cane's is life"", but how do you begin to explain to the heathens  who like Popeyes or, god forbid, KFC what an unfrozen, freshly battered, deep fried, orgasm tastes like? How do you tell the plebs that their chicken game gon need some work? 

Mother lovers, you cannot! The ignorant will always ignore your deep love for Cane's sensuous ridges that take in their sauce like a mother cradling her newborn baby... so fucking good.The crunch that makes everything slow down for a minute so you can catch your breath after a hard days work. The heat, like the underbelly of a black bear, warm enough to keep even the most anemic homeless person comfortable in the winters. Then there is the SAUUUUUUCCCCEE.

You can read every article on the internet, you can taste it ten thousand times, but if you haven't worked in their establishment, you have no right to try to recreate the magic that is Cane's sauce. Take everything you learned about the grace and beauty of the world and turn it into a sauce and put that into your mouth.. you might come close. 

Cane's sauce is the first thing I would offer extra terrestrial life if they so chose to ask why we deserve to live. Cane's sauce could replace all men's jizz and I would go down gladly. Cane's sauce does not judge, it does not want, it does not discriminate: put that shit on fries, put it in chicken, on bread.... put it on fucking slaw if you want. It is gonna taste bomb. 

To quote a meme: if you ain't eating Cane's? ""Fuck yo chicken strips""."
