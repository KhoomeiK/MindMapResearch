My600lbLife,fmum24o,t1_fkzhq2j,1586394059.0,Nobody  is holding her accountable. Watch countless other episodes and read the threads and people... Reddit holds them accountable. I do have empathy for her but I don‚Äôt understand why everyone was all  sweet and nice with their comments about her but had no problem knocking the other guests down a notch or 2. It just seems hypocritical to me.   Some of the other less likeable guests.... didn‚Äôt get that same compassion.
toronto,fm8oxyb,t3_fqwb30,1585853329.0,This...is amazing. Too bad my condo and the others around me are only 4 stories :(
My600lbLife,fls93yn,t1_flr2qto,1585436983.0,whoever makes this I will pay you in bells :)
My600lbLife,fls8z6t,t1_flpvcr2,1585436904.0,yessssss!!!!!
My600lbLife,fkz5lrz,t1_fkz2ibr,1584663293.0,"yes but in comparison to some of the other people on this show...not necessarily. There was one woman who was gang raped by I think 5 men....I'd say that's also pretty fucking fucked up. I feel bad for her, I do...but I also think these people know how to play the victim card and they feed into it and do nothing to help themselves. \*shrug\* I realize I'm the unpopular opinion here but her extra shitty life doesn't give her a free pass. She's still a shitty parent taking advantage of the system and everyone around her. Sorry"
My600lbLife,fkz0p72,t1_fkwdn0j,1584660202.0,"I agree her backstory is terrible and tragic. But she still has to take some responsibility. Almost everyone on this show has been molested, raped multiple times, had terrible parents, etc. etc. Trust me, I do feel sorry for her but at the same time she has to take responsibility for herself and her health. What happened to her is absolutely horrible but it went from ""reason"" to ""crutch"" very quickly. Shitty things happen to people all the time, everyday. You can't use that as an excuse forever."
My600lbLife,fg3baac,t1_ffz2ip2,1580476862.0,ugh......I'll never get that image out of my head now
My600lbLife,ffi58k3,t1_ffc5rd5,1579965420.0,She always looks miserable. I 'd assume she gets some money from TLC for being on he show or Dr Now gives her a little extra? You'd think she could at least not look like she hates her life for the 2 min she is on the air....
My600lbLife,fepovey,t1_felpyl1,1579326438.0,This deserves way more points

depression,fc16hab,t1_fc0ibua,1577309631.0,Me too...I called my ex just wanting to talk and ended up breaking down crying and rather than being sympathetic he was just annoyed and rather mean. :(  He has family and friends to be with today and I don't. I just wanted him to say something kind to me and he couldn't even do that. I guess I really do need to let him go. He's clearly not worth it... :(
depression,fc166ri,t1_fc0wzkf,1577309395.0,I've been in therapy for a few moths....I like her but I don't feel like it's helping. She is very patient and kind and listens but I feel like I need more. I need tools to deal with the loss of my relationship and anxiety and depression. Maybe I'm expecting too much?
depression,fc15zap,t3_effx75,1577309224.0,I'm having a VERY hard time today too. My boyfriend of 9 years broke up with me 2 mths ago and this is my first Christmas alone. My family is all out of state and I don't have any friends here. I'm 39 years old and I thought I was going to marry this guy. I feel like I'm loosing my mind
