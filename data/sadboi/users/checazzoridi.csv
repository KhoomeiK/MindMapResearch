TheLastAirbender,foxk31l,t3_ga52so,1588146483.0,"ATLA is not about epic fights it is about morality. If you just want to see the most extravagant combat (which is fine i sometimes want that too) ATLA is not the show for you.

The show is inspired by the asian part of world war 2 and it is about the horrors of war and how destroying your enemy is morally wrong. The kid literally lost his entire civilisation and still does not seek revenge. In essence it is about how good guys can become bad guys and how bad guys can become good guys.

I love the character development and i love the overall world which is basically a decentralised China (Earth Kingdom) versus a fast modernising imperialist Japan (Fire Nation)"
AskReddit,foxer7a,t1_fowtp5t,1588141771.0,Agreed but i don’t like to think about those movies...
AskReddit,fow468u,t1_fow3put,1588112686.0,"I personally loved Korra, not as much as ATLA but that is mostly because Korra tried so hard being the sequel it felt more like an glorified tribute than a story on it’s own in my opinion. It had so much potential and that is shown in seasons 3 and 4.

I absolutely hated the whole spirit battle in season 2 tho that murdered the in-world logic

Edit: and btw my comment just became top comment it wasn’t 20 minutes ago :)"

teenagers,fovzg5g,t1_fovx2rv,1588110239.0,"That’s great! New interests are fun to discover so i would say go for it.

But just know being an introvert who likes different stuff than most is not a bad thing. I’m an extrovert who wears “expensive” clothes but i like a lot of “different” stuff too. My best friend is an introvert and because of him i keep my geeky side alive. And it’s hella fun."
teenagers,fovw223,t3_g9vk5t,1588108521.0,"Be yourself.

Faking you like stuff just because other people tell you you should like it is wrong, and you won’t enjoy it at all. Find people who like the same things as you do and you will be way happier!

Trying new things is another story. I like all those things you just mentioned but i also like a lot of other stuff. So yes, you should stay yourself. Adding to that? Could be great you should try it!"
