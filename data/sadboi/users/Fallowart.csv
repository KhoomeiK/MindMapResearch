If what I posted came off as offended or was not worded right I hope you understand that was not my intend. But looking over it I am not sure why you would call me soft or offended for posting a critique of your ideas. (And quite frankly it isn't soft in itself to disagree with someone) If anything it seems like your on the defensive for something that was never ment to be argumentative

 I understand and to a point agree with all of your stances but just not the wording or how black and white it is. I understand the critique of PC culture but one thing I have found very helpful from it has been on the focus of how we word things in ways that may alienate or polarize a topic. You say ""people are focuses on wrong irrelevant things"" it doesn't encourage people to listen to what your trying to say but rather makes them either in the right or the wrong. In terms of nuance I agree with your final point that it's painful to see people who won't accept things that are right in front of them, but that is in line with the fact that disordered thinking is irrational. It doesn't excuse it or make it ""okay""* to just play victim and remain trapped in a disorder but it's about being able to accept that someone is struggling and doing the best they can in that moment while understanding that they can improve.

*I use okay loosely as avoiding shoulds and coulds is important to overcoming irrational thoughts"

Part of panic disorder of course is fearing the attacks but it can be so discouraging for someone to hear they are weak for not just suffering through panic attacks.

If I had to I would say you meet the criteria in terms of difficulty controlling anger, but I will post the criteria below. You have to meet five of the criteria to be considered BPD.

It’s possible you suffered from it earlier but have been able to overcome certain aspects and are no longer meeting enough of the criteria. Sorry if I am being kinda vague, it’s just the place of a professional to diagnose as these criteria can be interpreted in various ways and require some context. 

“Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment; this does not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in criterion 5

A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation

Markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self

Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (eg, spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating) [5] ; this does not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in criterion 5

Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior

Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (eg, intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)

Chronic feelings of emptiness

Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (eg, frequent displays of temper, constant anger, or recurrent physical fights)

Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms”

I endured constant guilt tripping followed by me asking to be on my stomach so I could cry without him seeing. When he asked to have sex and I knew he would take no with verbal manipulation I would go to the bathroom and sob, clean up, and put on a show...I am so relieved to have a new guy in my life who literally would rather me be entirely comfortable over any amount of sex or contact."

AnorexiaNervosa,epxt51o,t3_bwcrye,1559610106.0,"I recommend instead of eating less eat more foods that are nutritional and don’t limit the quantities. Craving sweets? enjoy kiwis, mangos, apples, grapes, all of it. Craving hearty make a big salad or have some fresh avocado. Edamame, beans, rice, corn, or my favorite broccoli. Don’t care about calories, eat foods that are naturally wonderful for you that you can eat large quantities of without a care. Limiting let’s Ana in. Limitless frees you to enjoy life while exploring all that plants have to offer. 
(Sorry if this sounds like an ad for veganism, I am not suggesting the diet, it’s just the foods I personally eat and voucher for)"
AnorexiaNervosa,epgl6iw,t3_bua640,1559215016.0,Put yourself in a place you CANNOT binge. Go out somewhere without food around or with people that will keep you accountable or at the very least be a barrier from it. Also pick up a hobby to replace it. You can’t create a void without filling it. A common ED stereotype is knitting but even brief intense exercise or drawing can help keep you distracted. Just never dwell.
depression,epgkfch,t3_buq56r,1559214717.0,"My mother asked me how I described depression. I told her it was like living in the moment when someone tells you bad news. Your caught up in an internal world of confusion, hurt, and numb denial."
AnorexiaNervosa,epbwnfw,t3_bu62al,1559147705.0,I have a stash of hostess cakes and cookies hidden to chew and spit when I get hungry.

AnorexiaNervosa,eouzi53,t1_eouy4pe,1558885042.0,Omg I might try this!
AnorexiaNervosa,eouzgb5,t1_eouhotj,1558885003.0,I completely understand!
AnorexiaNervosa,eouhn8b,t3_bt4xxd,1558867596.0,I hate seeing people who are skinny in public for the same reason. But I try to remember that they probably struggle with many side effects from their weight and that helps me feel less inclined to restrict more...
AnorexiaNervosa,eoos3pr,t3_br1zv6,1558746481.0,The DSM-4 called it EDNOS or Eating Disoder Not Otherwise Specified. Most practitioners call it that still. I received the diagnosis before I lost weight dramatically but I received help none the less.
AnorexiaNervosa,eoo9svd,t3_bsjwuv,1558733202.0,I have been vegan well before my ED but am willing to go vegetarian for a little bit to deal with my ED. Luckily they called and rereviewed my case and said I could do residential. If my new therapist and group doesn’t work I will consider it.
