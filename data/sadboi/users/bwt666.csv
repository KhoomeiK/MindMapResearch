AskMen,fqj1yw3,t1_fqj0il6,1589403950.0,"Lol same!!! And that’s happened before where he wasn’t in the mood so i started doing it myself and then he was ready to go! But very recently i tried that tactic and he left the bedroom to give me “personal time” and I’m like boo I’m trying to get you in the mood! 

But maybe he is overthinking it and I have no idea about it. He’s got a lot of work to do in the recognizing and expressing his thoughts and feelings department. I try to talk to him about all of this but maybe I’m approaching it the wrong way. Any suggestions from a male perspective?"
AskMen,fqizeb6,t1_fqiegqm,1589402959.0,Isn’t that what monogamous relationships are though?
AskMen,fqiyj8x,t1_fqixcfa,1589402624.0,"I’ve been thinking that could be a part of it definitely! Does a great wank make one want to have real sex with their partner any more than before though? Or just to get them chemicals themselves...?

Do you have any tips for bringing up the mental health issues? I don’t think he would respond super easily/well to me bringing something like that up if i don’t do it right...

I’m nervy too because antidepressants notoriously kill your sex drive, so like even less sex possibly... saying that out loud I’m like holy shit how selfish can you be!!! (To myself)

I on the other hand I take 4 different medications for my mental health shiz and am still horny as ever. Sometimes i wish i had that side effect so we might have similar sex drives, but maybe my sex drive is so high it just powers through the pills 🤷🏻‍♀️"
AskMen,fqixe7g,t1_fqivy5u,1589402179.0,"I’ve been thinking it’s depression too, I have depression and anxiety and bpd so I feel like I can spot the signs lol which is also crazy to me because I take a decent amount of medication to stabilize my mood (4 different medications!) that usually ruin people’s sex drive and ability to finish and I’m low key wishing that I had those side effects!

AskMen,fqiwkfq,t1_fqisulp,1589401861.0,"No condoms ugh I hate them too there’s gotta be a better way lol

Just to make sure i understand, are you saying sex for men is the same amount of effort as giving bjs? Mentally and/or physically?

I guess I’m frustrated too I’d be thrilled with any kind of sex! I don’t think I’ve really asked for anything with sex with my current partner, besides actually having it. I’ve asked before hell just finger me to completion or kiss me and stuff while i masturbate and i guess he has to be in the mood for that too? We’ve both always thought and said to each other that we’re good at banging each other (lol) and have good sexual chemistry and there’s only been a handful of times in our 3.5 year relationship where I didn’t finish and i don’t make a thing of it, like in the moment, until he’s not in the mood to have sex again later or the next day or next day"
AskMen,fqisqf0,t1_fqirjlt,1589400372.0,"Ugh thank you for the validation!! That’s exactly how I feel, I think it’s reasonable but I constantly feel horrible about being upset about it because so many people tell me it’s normal and everyone does it and it’s unreasonable !!!! He included tells me it’s unreasonable to ask him, and not like I could really enforce it either right ?!*shrug*"
AskMen,fqirhp8,t1_fqi96as,1589399887.0,"I appreciate what you’re saying but I think that really is a generalized statement. Every website and forum and whatever is an issue with the woman rejecting the man. I’m rejected constantly and really think it’s my fault so of course I try to set the mood and look sexy and suggest new positions and ultimately try to give him the best sex so that maybe he’ll stop rejecting me so much, of course I care about him getting off! When I’m about to finish before I want the sex to end I just take a pause and do a little kissing and then it’s back on. Obviously I’ll never know what it’s like to have sex as a man it all of these things seem like issues women deal with too"
AskMen,fqiq9a1,t1_fqilk3m,1589399417.0,Ugh. Don’t sooo many men look at porn though? And still be able to maintain a “normal” sex life where each party is satisfied? Maybe I’m assuming but all of my friends don’t have this issue and my bff is a guy who tells me that every guy watches porn. Meaning I don’t want to give him an ultimatum cause that seems controlling to me and like it would backfire either way but maybe that’s what it’s come to?
AskMen,fqipbg9,t1_fqikjpx,1589399059.0,"But he’s not starving for sex/cumming, I’m not the one constantly rejecting him? Not trying to fight/push back on you, I just don’t seem to understand it and want to so badly!"
AskMen,fqip1as,t1_fqiiic5,1589398953.0,"It’s pretty one sided where I’m the one constantly initiating and then being rejected. I’ve probably rejected him 3-4 times in the past 2.5-3 years... because even if I’m not super in the mood I know it’s not like I’ll have a *bad* time and then always end up into it and then enjoying it after a little foreplay. Which I’ve asked if he would try that and he said he will but his trying is laying there silently and motionless while I suck his *hard* dick and still tells me he’s not into it. So it’s a little confusing too. 

We did have the conversation about nagging cause fair point and I hadn’t really considered it. So then I stopped, which kind of helped with the painful rejection part but now we only have sex on his schedule. Which like he doesn’t want to have sex so we don’t do I’m making the sacrifice, but I want to and we don’t, once again making the sacrifice. And like him sacrificing means having sex I guess I just don’t get it"

I’ve had to change meds a lot and it sucks but now I’m pretty happy I shopped around cause I don’t really experience any side effects now— might be a conversation worth having with your doctor?"
weed,ffd9ndj,t3_eszxbd,1579816150.0,"Let me preface by saying i smoke everyday, and am technically underweight by BMI standards: 5’3” at 100lbs

Certo jell worked for me— certojell + 20 oz Snapple (I chose Snapple for taste) about 2 hours before my test, like literally chugged it and didn’t pee (vv uncomfortable) then took some vitamins to add some color to my urine. 

Mind you, I smoked a j a day before the test... so personally I think you’re probably good for a test in a month!

My first test was too diluted, went back a day or 2 later and passed. 

I also got a box of like 20 urine tests from amazon to test myself daily. 

If you google certojell drug test there are a lot of different techniques posted by people but this is the general idea. 

Good luck!!"

I started bc in high school which can also be a hard time for everyone it’s hard for me to differentiate between teen angst, hormones and BPD symptoms now that I think about it... it seems the paranoia, distrusting people and their intentions, identity issues have been around for awhile probably since childhood but the consistent emotional outbursts/episodes with self harm etc didn’t really start until I was around 20? So I’m 26 now and was diagnosed may 2019 

Do you use any hormonal birth control or the copper iud?

Also, a lot of people with BPD also deal with depression and anxiety— it’s very possible he’s going through an episode and/or is just isolating. Maybe out of habit or maybe just a need for alone time, without communicating that to you super well. 

I don’t know how long you have been together but I know that I have needed a lot of time to learn how to effectively communicate my feelings, in addition to feeling comfortable being honest/communicative about needing space and what not

Hope this helps!"
