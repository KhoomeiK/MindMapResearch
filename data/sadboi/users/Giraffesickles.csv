It's just good to put effort into the relationship that feels right and brings you Joy. 

I mean autistic in the sense that he'd be very stoic. He'd just stand and stare with no reaction cause he doesn't know what to give. It would take the wind out if my sails as I'm quite bubbly and expressive, partly as a cooing mechanism. 

We'd have a conversation and he'd say ""I need time to think on an answer..I can't reply straight away"" id be totally understanding and wait and then feel bad for putting him on the spot so I'd change the subject onto a lighter one. So we'd never have proper talks that needed to happen. Then it would get to a stage where I'd stay quiet and then he'd try change the subject. I'd gently remind him that I'm waiting on a response and hed just lash out. Cry and panic and give me puppy eyes.felt really fake but I'm not sure it was.  It was uncomfortable.
Then he'd bring up these random things he hates about me as a defensive thing and go off!!

It would be worth making an effort once a week even and making you guys a meal where yours is 'clean' and his 'dirty' and talk to him, explain that you still love him no matter what and that youre happy to cook him one of 'his' meals a week but if he wants those meals all the time then make them himself.   
Really sit with him and, in a calm, loving and compassionate voice tell him you still love him. Not like saying it exasperated mid-fight like ""of course i still love you ffs!"". Take a breath, look him in the eyes and say it with meaning.

I was the (interpreted) same in that I didnt know what to be grateful for. I realised I held a high, and warped, standard for my gratitude. I started by being grateful for seemingly obvious things.   


""i'm grateful for this drink in front of me, the warmth from my heater, the wifi, the food"" It doesn't really matter how you obtained it, you have it. Be thankful you're not in an alternate reality where you don't have that.

I find, and I’m in no way qualified just have a similar mum by the sounds of it, that if I remove myself and think objectively about how she or other people feel in a situation I can then think about it in a compassionate sense. This can bring a bit of peace. 
 it may are it a bit easier on you that you can feel sorry for her for not being able to adequately feel sorry for you. Also that her way of lashing out CAN/MAY be a way of being sympathetic toward you but frustrated also she can’t help her baby.  

It all depends on how she is normally. We all have our moments.
