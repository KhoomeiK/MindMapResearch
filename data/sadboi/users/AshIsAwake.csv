While you keep working on it, please be kind to yourself. When times are hard, show yourself compassion. Find whatever good you can.

It's difficult, and it sucks, but I believe it can get better for you. In the meantime, you aren't alone in these struggles."
ptsd,fg0bors,t3_ew8mak,1580404417.0,"For me and I imagine many, it got much harder before it got better.

I feel like introducing any humanoid enemies/other sentient races might be better as a different game outright though... Just seems like fighting them would be too different than bugs, and I don't think any other races think Hoxxis is worth the trouble... Hmm.

There is a lot I miss about not needing a cane, but I can't pretend I miss all the BS from people.

Of course, despite the cane, most of my disabilities are still invisible and now I have people giving me shit because "" you need a cane AND you are autistic AND you have PTSD??? What's next??""

So, fewer random ignorant people giving me shit, but actually talking to Able people is still a nightmare."
