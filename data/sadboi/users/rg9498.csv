movies,fqf9239,t1_fqf2mcj,1589320758.0,misread your tone. and i will thank you :)
movies,fqewutd,t1_fqd7dcn,1589314916.0,you‚Äôre acting like im being a buzzkill know it all. i have no problem with people enjoying this movie but it was specifically in reply to a comment praising the film for its accuracy which just isnt true. this reddit for movie buffs is the appropriate place to discuss these things. stay mad.
movies,fqd2sr6,t1_fqd2iit,1589277757.0,im not saying the movie was a bad thing but that doesnt mean its inaccuracies shouldnt be acknowledged. but on that note it would be great to see a movie that shows the mayans being less overly brutal and more nuanced.
movies,fqd0fxl,t1_fqcvamn,1589275303.0,im sorry but this movie while entertaining/well done is still a huge mess when it comes to historical inaccuracy..literally ask any mesoamerican archaeologist or historian. i have zero clue where you‚Äôre getting the idea that this movie is a realistic depiction of the maya from. even the concept of isolated hunter-gather tribes (who somehow still spoke the same language as the city dwellers) was NOT a thing.
horror,fq21txf,t3_gg779v,1589052074.0,hi this is SUPER specific but i was surprised to not see The Strangers (2008) in the home invasion section (it‚Äôs one of my favorites üòÖ). i also think it would be okay to double categorize movies in my opinion! for instance Aliens could go in both the scifi and action sections. a lot of these films can fit into several different categories. great list!

depression,fkhz3hd,t1_fkgemkh,1584208679.0,why should i do an AMA? and yeah i really do try to see things from their perspective. not as in agree with them but to see how their lives and upbringings have led them to be like this. but on the other hand it‚Äôs hard to not be offended because their views are harmful.

depression,fcsf1it,t3_eiiwam,1577915614.0,"i used to have that problem. have you tried falling asleep to a movie or tv show? i used to fall asleep to friends everynight and that helped me so much. anything lighthearted to get your mind away from bad thoughts, especially comedies. its funny ive probably seen almost every episode because of that but never 100% was paying attention so i barely remember it. i also recommend melatonin. its natural and something you can buy anywhere. i feel your pain üíö"
