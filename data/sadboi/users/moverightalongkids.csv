My dad died seven years ago. I reconciled with him maybe two years prior, but had the option to years before. Different circumstances as to why we were not speaking, but lesson learned is likely transferable.

I wish I had reconciled sooner. People make bad choices in emotional times, and while what they did is pretty damn mean, to me it trumps the potential guilt you might feel later when they pass away.

If you reconcile and there is any sign of judgment or passive aggressive commentary, then kick them to the curb, but they have likely gotten over their anger and distaste and want to reconcile for the better. 

I hope this helps."
