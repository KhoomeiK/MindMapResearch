SuicideWatch,f06aune,t3_d4037y,1568433837.0,"I’m in college now friend and I’ve always struggled with the same fundamental problem. My advice to start would be to recognize is there’s no such thing a weird person. We’re all unique, time has shown me that typically it’s people like us that do well later on so that’s your first upside. I know the the feeling of wanting friends not just friends but real friends that care about you on a daily basis. Sadly you can’t try actively to make them type of friends to come into your life they’re spontaneous but once you find one (or one finds you) and trust me it’ll happen buddy things will improve quickly. To speed the process up put yourself in places with like-minded people. If you need anything else lmk.

P.s. my best coping mechanism is finding ways of self advancement ie to ensure a good future :)"
