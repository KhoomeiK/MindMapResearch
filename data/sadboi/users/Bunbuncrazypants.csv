The good news is you can be redeemed. Put in the work to never lose your temper in a physical way again.

If that’s the rule it should’ve been known before hand. 

It’s a little crazy to expect rights to someone’s property just because they were in your house."
relationship_advice,fifczyj,t3_f7rt1k,1582388579.0,Chemistry is a lot more common than you think it is. Don’t settle on someone who gets abusive when they drink. It would only get worse.

AskReddit,fi8vv4b,t3_f6v8u4,1582249548.0,"You’re at a small house party. You see your best friend across the room. You call their name, wave. As you approach, you realize it is not your friend but a stranger. They look at you with a confused/ creeped out look on their face. Your stomach starts to growl. You try to sneak off to the bathroom but a massive fart escapes you right at the moment when the song switches. Everyone hears and turns to see you going into the bathroom. You go in and have explosive diarrhea. When you flush, the toilet overflows.

You go to text the best friend, tell him/ her what happened and ask him/ her to rescue you. You hit send only to realize you somehow sent the message in a group text to your entire family. Loop into infinity."

I feel like some waves, especially some in the foreground, are quite triangle-y. They have an almost convex quality on the lines. Waves are usually convex on one side and concave onthe other, even if it’s just a bit.

I’m not using anything even approaching the right terminology but I hope you get what I mean.

Still a very lovely painting."
TwoXChromosomes,fi8stw3,t3_f70uvv,1582247543.0,"There was a Reddit thread many years ago where a woman commented that she had been raped in two separate incidents. Some dumb fuck commented “How do you keep letting yourself get into those situations?” She fell into a shame spiral in the following comments and got downvoted into oblivion. 

I didn’t have an account then and I was just a lurker but I think about those comments and that lady all the time. I wish I had said something. I hope she’s okay.

I can’t seem to escape abuse. I think a lot about an episode of Casefile (podcast) where a woman would not leave her second husband even though he was abusive because her first husband had been abusive. She said something to her friend to the effect of “What’s the point? Another abuser will get me eventually.” Her second husband murdered her.

I feel that in my bones. No self worth, no hope. Just trapped."

Your wife is being super weird and creepy.

You were an a hole by affirming you thought your ex was hotter, especially because it seems like you did that out of irritation and anger. You should’ve confronted your wife and tried to talk to her before you got so angry that all you could do is blow up at her.

Your wife is never going to be able to unhear that.

She probably needs some therapy for that weird obsessive behavior."
AmItheAsshole,fi6y8gf,t3_f6r5tx,1582210248.0,"NAH. I think you had good intent and handmade is a lovely sentiment.

She’s allowed to be upset that it is a very simple metal ring that didn’t take much effort. Sounds like effort is what she wanted, to show how much she means to you."

Turns out I had way too much spinal fluid. It was crushing my brain and my optic nerve. My eyesight was permanently damaged because I didn’t get a diagnosis for 2 years. The pressure was so high they did two spinal taps to get me in normal range. I definitely don’t remember exact numbers but I think normal pressure is around 8 and mine was in the mid 30s."

interestingasfuck,fhxc8cd,t1_fhxbzk6,1581950840.0,My grandpa beat my grandma when they were a young couple but eventually stopped and was a supportive partner. It’s not nuanced. He was a wife beater and she died hating him and hating herself for staying with him.
AskReddit,fhu8r66,t1_fhttkv4,1581883478.0,"My ex (shared custody so he’s in my life forever. Yay) constantly gives me shit for calling the cops on him for “nothing”.

I kicked him off me and ran to the room where he kept his gun, locked the door and called 911. He continued to scream incoherently for a while.

The cops didn’t even do anything and there are no charges, but apparently I’m an evil vindictive bitch trying to ruin his life. Then he wonders why I will not move back in."
BPD,fhtel90,t1_fhq3vwj,1581873697.0,Hey you could not bully other people. It is factually correct that many people with BPD have hallucinations. It’s wrong to misrepresent that and try to make people feel bad.
BPD,fhq3f0u,t1_fhq2itl,1581798765.0,Also it’s literally called borderline personality disorder because we are on the borderline between neurosis and psychosis. Psychosis is not “might happen”. Psychosis is a main feature. That’s what makes it BPD and not depression or bipolar.
BPD,fhq38hu,t1_fhq2itl,1581798673.0,"Yeah you could google it instead of assuming whatever support group you were in was the epitome of knowledge. I can’t fix your willful ignorance and I don’t want to.

AmItheAsshole,fhq2g6r,t1_fhpdyh1,1581798445.0,"She said there was no physical abuse. Obviously there was a lot of abuse if she is cutting them out of her life completely.

It’s possible she may not be ready to tell you about the abuse. She may not be ready to admit certain things to herself. I had a traumatic childhood. If I try to talk about it, my entire life will unravel and I will be unable to function. 

If you really care about her you have to let her heal on her terms. It’s not unreasonable to be upset and unnerved by the lies. I think you should get some therapy too to help you realize it probably has nothing to do with you and how to cope with that and release the anger. 

You really have no right to know if she was abused."
AmItheAsshole,fhq12d8,t3_f4bu0a,1581797759.0,"YTA.

The brothers are criminals. How many times do you think they stole from her or endangered her life with their nonsense? You should understand that cutting her entire family out of her life is extreme so she must have a really great reason for it.

You should let it go.

She should’ve told you the truth. It’s understandable why she didn’t."

I’ll be honest though, it’s really common for people to talk about this stuff. I’ve seen guy and girl groups do it. Doesn’t make it right. She probably didn’t realize it would upset you. She should apologize though.

Please don’t feel weird about your kink; most of my male partners have really enjoyed nipple stimulation. I think a lot of guys just don’t realize it can be pleasurable for men too or they feel emasculated if they try or ask for it."
BPD,fhpudid,t3_f4atx6,1581795291.0,"Isolation doesn’t particularly bother me in itself. I am more prone to fearful hallucinations if I’m alone when I’m stressed. If I am stressed but other people are around, it helps me feel more grounded in reality. I use the other people around me to gauge reality and I can dismiss hallucinations more easily."
BPD,fhpt9oz,t1_fhpcmem,1581794897.0,Just google how BPD got its name. Cause we are on the border of neurosis and psychosis. Psychosis is one of the defining features of BPD.
