If you find yourself falling for people when you don't want to, have a look at what you seek to obtain from being in a relationship with them. Often it is to fill a hole in your life, do you feel lonely? Inadequate? Not ""fun""? Is it FOMO, when you see your friends in relationships? Seek to improve yourself, enjoy time by yourself, build your interests, eat healthy and exercise. Become self sufficient and you won't find a need for another person to fulfil your emotional needs.

They didn't give me a key and I had to wait for my roommate to come back, once I waited an hour. These sites are mainly money-looting. On the front they act like they care about you a lot, and then they take your money for everything - cleaning (our place was hardly ever cleaned, there were rats and cockroaches and garbage everywhere), electricity (they don't show you the meter readings, just increase the price and take money) and ""token amount"". They have minute clauses for returning deposit, I haven't gotten mine back and I don't think I will. I was checking out a place on Nestaway, and was led on a wild goose chase for the office, then I found that the apartment displayed on the website didn't even exist! I'd suggest reading reviews carefully for the particular property beforehand, reviews about the website, reviews about customer service. Check it out personally and make sure you speak to the people already living there - most people in my property left within 1-2 months of staying even though they would not get their deposit back, these places are that bad.
