emotionalabuse,fka1w3r,t3_fh9my1,1583989656.0,Stay strong. You left for a reason. Don't lose sight of that reason. You are a good person and deserve better. Familiar doesn't make it okay.  I know this is hard and am so proud that you left. You will heal.

AskReddit,fc2l5vz,t1_fc273uk,1577365610.0,Omg the image. This will be funny some day. But for now just know couches can be cleaned.
AskReddit,fc2l0dy,t1_fc29wsp,1577365424.0,My sympathies to you. I can only imagine how hard that would be.
AskReddit,fc2kn18,t3_efqzp6,1577364978.0,Cooking and cleaning for my in laws for the last 3 days while they drink enough to keep an entire liquor store in business. My husband berating me for an hour at 1am for the third night in a row. Screaming in my face loud enough for the whole house to hear about what a horrible person I am. Everyone else on this planet hates me and thinks I am a bitch too. It was great. Woke up to him grabbing and trying to feel me up at 6am.

mississauga,f9wnhdl,t1_f9vfcrp,1575695549.0,"You need a plastic sled or toboggan, perch at the top of the hill, give yourself a push and you zoom down the hill!  A short rush of adrenaline as you speed to the bottom.  It's a fun way to spend a couple of hours and great exercise as you walk back up the hill every time."
depression,f5wjl5s,t3_dpl4bu,1572525271.0,"This is me. I am around my kids or at work and I am ""normal"".  Smiling, interactive and functioning like everything is alright. I get in my car to drive home and cry the whole way. Get home and smile for the kids. Then the moment I am alone again it comes back and I relive every moment through the lens of a failure. I hate living this way and feel so sad deep down inside but no one knows. It's an awful way to get through my days but I can't get out of it. Hugs to you from a fellow double-lifer."
