depression,fnl7kej,t3_fjthj0,1587048514.0,Hey I've been reading the comments here quite a bit. I feel you to some extent. My room is a mess because I've pushed off cleaning it since... forever and I always hope it looks better the next day and always gets worse. I'm tired of feeling so helpless. So sorrowful... it fucking blows. I see you're into exercise. I'd be down to Google duo or Skype so we could exercise together. Granted I SUCK at physical fitness I'd try my best. Just to get you back on track with socializing  and exercise at the same time.
lonely,fmwqxk1,t1_fmwp2i5,1586451456.0,Yes that's actually been a study. Lonely people are worse off and do tend to die faster. It raises cortisol levels and just screws us over.
lonely,fmwqs2g,t3_fxqh75,1586451379.0,I want to cuddle too... I REALLY dont need sexual things rn. I have that covered but being held or holding someone would make me feel so nice rn.
lonely,fmud9vd,t3_fxfpvz,1586389137.0,... this really is me... sometimes I feel the people closest to me doesnt even know me.
lonely,fmubnjj,t1_fmu9xfa,1586388238.0,Ass lol if that wasn't implied already.
lonely,fmg5g7j,t1_fmg08kr,1586041658.0,You're right... I should be more appreciative. Thanks
