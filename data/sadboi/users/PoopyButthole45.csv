AskReddit,flc43u0,t1_flavu3u,1585019398.0,Yea I can agree with that. It’s just one of those situations that’s so frustrating that you can’t help but feel exasperatedly upset. There’s just probably nothing anyone can do at this point. I feel like if you could get him to really show some of the pain underneath then that would at least humanize him and maybe keep the trolls away. It would also be a huge breakthrough since a lot of his behavior is built around avoiding that pain and/or compensating for it. I guarantee those trolls have added to that pain though even if he doesn’t show it.

Did you take the time to fully process your feelings and heal from said heartbreak?

I’m all for female empowerment and think this sub does have some good advice, but am worried that this sub is appealing to heartbroken women that are looking for a quick way out of their emotional pain by adopting an ideology that oversimplifies dating in a way that allows the women to feel empowered. This is similar to the psychology behind Why people join cults or gangs. And also what allowed nazism to take hold in Germany. I think that this is also what caused the rise in red pill type thinking among men and that this sub is a reaction to the damage those men caused by “plating” women. How do you all feel about everything I just said?"

With the exception of rare situations when the person is going through some extreme shit, that reaction either means BPD or NPD.

It’s probably really fucked him up and honestly I think less of any fully grown person that thinks it’s ok to bash him like he’s not even human. It gets even sadder when you realize the background he’s coming from too. He’s the result of a teenage pregnancy. His dad left and his mom got into drugs, tried to throw herself in front of traffic and I think even spent time as a prostitute. That’s already such a traumatic environment to come from and music was probably his outlet and now he gets ridiculed regularly for trying to do it (and he is a very talented signer from a technical aspect). I bet the fact that a lot of the people who think it’s ok to ridicule him are from the more humane side of society (aka liberals) also really fucks with him. These are the people who usually defend the downtrodden yet they will just ruthlessly ridicule Bieber for no other reason than to get a laugh. It’s just not cool."

MensLib,fjb8vjt,t3_fcgewl,1583188821.0,"I think it’s been perverted by a bunch of guys who are just blindly following feminisms every whim to earn social favor and get in the good books of women. It’s 100% something that happened and I don’t think we should ignore it. I also don’t think it’s men’s only motivation though and I don’t think the guys that did that were even conscious of it a lot of the time. People have a drive to be seen as good and desirable and it can cause them to unconsciously cast aside their true beliefs so that they can be liked. I think this became a big thing in past few years and now  the whole idea of male feminists is kind of tainted.

I think the best way forward is for people not to choose polarized stances on the issues “All male feminists are trying to get laid” or “everyone who calls people white knights or sjws are just bitter”. Instead I think people should view it as a very complex issue. As altruism is when you’re a creature that has a large drive towards narcissism. I personally think a happier, more inclusive society makes people happier overall and that chasing your own pleasures is a dead end road that’s not fulfilling in the long run. Which is a way of integrating narcissism and altruism into a mutually beneficial agreement. 

I also think men need to be more informed and honest though. We need to really represent ourselves and how we feel instead of feeling too intimidated to ever challenge the mainstream agenda. People can tell when someone isnt being honest and is just riding the societal bandwagon to make their life easier. And when you get a bunch of people like that speaking out online then you create an environment where people start to think all male feminists are bullshit. We need to start being honest and genuine and learn to confront the issues as they actually are. I’m all for feminism but it needs to be balanced by realistic, deeply-probed opinions from men on their own issues and vision of society. I think men are scared to do this because if we ever say anythinf wrong about sex relations, everyone jumps down our throats and labels us a women-hater or misandrist. Meanwhile women are allowed to cross the line into saying inappropriate things about men without this backlash. Although the latter has been changing in recent years."

We also had Radiohead and a few other movements like the garage rock kick (strokes, white stripes) and bands like arcade fire and lcd soundsystem. Theres brilliant stuff coming out nowadays and anyone who doesnt think so is being overly nostalgic or not thinking enough.

Also, side note, but the movie “Midnight in Paris” comes to mind when talking about this subject. The whole theme is about people always romanticizing earlier times and not being able to appreciate how great theyre times are."
HolUp,fiuqxcm,t3_f9pimo,1582746599.0,"I think it makes sense. First of all so that people can get a clearer picture of sexual assault and that the person doing it isn’t always a psychopath or monster. Sometimes they’re just a person who made a terrible decision based on instinct, and often when they were very young. And no I’m not defending sexual assault or have ever sexually assaulted someone. I just think it’s a complicated issue. And second because being able to forgive someone goes a long way. Holding onto all that anger and bitterness can really eat away at you and letting go of it is a relief. I went psychotic because of shit a girl did to me and if I could get an apology, an admission or wrongdoing and an explanation from her then it would go along way. But that’s not gonna happen because she’s npd and is actually just sort of a monster."

One moment, he’s on a nice cruise with his family. The next, he’s in shock over accidentally falling off the ship. I can’r even imagine what that moment even felt like. Probably just the sickest feeling in his stomach and then pandemonium breaks out.

Then he had to deal with the media blitz and judgement of the public, all the while he’s probably dealing with overwhelming guilt, both at dropping his granddaughter and at the hurt he caused his family, while also dealing with grief at her death. I just can’t imagine actually dealing with all this. It must just seem unreal. I wouldve killed myself by now honestly."
TwoXChromosomes,fil73ue,t3_f89dgb,1582495081.0,"The problem here is most guys never learn how to get sex or be desirable so they see you having sex with someone else and it makes them really jealous and upset because they’re not getting any. If these dudes got laid an adequate amount then they wouldn’t get these feelings or feel the need to break up a relationship over sex.

But I also find that if people like you and you have meaningless casual sex with people then they can’t help but get upset. If you’re in a relationship and love the guy you’re sleeping with then it won’t hurt them. But in my experience seeing someone you like have emotionless sex almost always causes pain."

dating_advice,fhlewt2,t1_fhlb8cs,1581699939.0,Yes I don’t see the point in meaningless sex either but in this case it would be meaningful. You can like someone romantically without wanting to full on date them. Which is how the dude in this scenario feels.

dating_advice,fhj4q7x,t1_fhj3jov,1581638118.0,Yes but I think I have a sort of trauma response to it.

I also jist had bad experiences as a kid that I didn’t realize were affecting me so much.

dating_advice,fhj2pwn,t1_fhj1lmp,1581637006.0,"Yes but I’m also insanely wounded and liking someone is hard. I get paranoid that anyone I like is just going to use it sgainsy me to smush my heart in the worst way possible because that’s basically what two girls did to me back when I used to trust people easily. I’m also just really scared of rejection and have urges to just avoid the person if I think the might reject me. Even if it’s just in my head and I’m interpreting shit wrong, which I’m really working on bexause in the past girls have so obviously liked me and I’ve ran away because of the stupidest little reaction or somethhinf. I’m also indecisive and flip-flop back and forward on liking people. In short, I’m just really fucked up but people can’t tell how bad it is because I dress really put together and take care of myself and act really easy-going and goofy and calm.

I just thought it was weird because I talked to her on Tuesday and she gave me a really adoring look when I said something funny and smiled at her and then I tried talking to her today and she seemed sort of distant and tense but then looked at me a few times afterwards. I know she could have a boyfriend or she couldve been nervous or tired or a bunch of other stuff but I was just scrolling instagram and someone posted something about thinking a guy was out of their league and it making her sad and it got me thinking. That probably sounds narcissistic but honestly I really like myself now and it causes me tk be incredibly likable. And I have a lot of really good traits (this probably sounds narcissistic but I hated myself for most of my life and just sort of came into my own recently)"
todayilearned,fhe8j33,t3_f2pnk9,1581516597.0,I really hope this whole Amber Heard thing helps people develop empathy for abused men. Just imagine being him.

aquarius,fh8jlnq,t1_fh8jf35,1581361117.0,I dunno I mean I generally just act on feeling and am really bad at bullshitting or pretending honestly. It definitely has something to do with mood because sometimes I just feel shitty snd closed off and other times I feel really playful. I’m fucked up.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fh1qibd,t1_fh1pt82,1581221267.0,"I didn’t say it comes from a hatred of men, just that it’s a bias. And honestly I think it is based in stats but also that feminism and liberal politics have become a way to get social clout so people just jump on that bandwagon and take the woman’s side just to be “cool”. And I’m not knocking feminism, because I think it’s great, just saying that it can go too far or become a game to some people.

And yea the people who know me stuck by my side but the fact is that I have something on my permanent record and that being looked at like some fucking creep by people who were defending the woman that drove me to psychosis is something that sort of sticks with you. It’s gotten better but I still feel pissed off about that sometimes. Plus a lot if the articles I read about narc abuse use “he” when referring to the narc and “she” when referring to the victim. That and I’ve straight up seen memes and stuff that say that the man is always the abuser and that if he says a woman abused him he’s lying. It’s very hard to read that shit when you’re trying to get over feeling like you were the shitty one or deserved it or whatever fucked opinion the narc put in your head. I remember reading stuff like that and beginning to question if I was the horrible one again and if I had just misconstrued everything she said. 

But honestly I think it’s part of a bigger problem of people just not giving a fuck about men or our issues. It’s ingrained in us. Men are biologically expendable. One man can make thousands of babies in a year yet a woman can only make one every 9 months. Which means we value women’s lives a lot more highly than we do men because doing so increases our chances to survive as a species. That inherent bias has crossed over into modern times but it’s not something people are conscious of which is why I think there’s such mass denial and even sometimes hostility when it’s brought up."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fh1p6bo,t1_fh1otre,1581220187.0,"Yes but in general there is definitely a bias towards men. I honestly think it’s even worse in the state I live in because it’s hyper-feminist and the court case took place in the most liberal county. Even my lawyer said that the courts usually side with women and that he thought it was because of their politics. I don’t expect a lot of people to agree though and I think even the men that know I’m right won’t say it because questioning anything that has to do with that type of thing causes people to freak out and immediately label you some alt-right, red pill woman-hater.

I’m not at all saying that women don’t get labeled the abuser either though because I know male narcs turn it around on the women too but I feel like it’s just a lot easier to play the victim as a woman and to turn society against a man and that literally almost no female abusers get held accountable because of it. Which is terrible since abuse is traumatic and ptsd symptoms are exacerbated by their being no justice for the perpetrators of the traumatic event."
radiohead,fh17xv7,t1_fgv58hk,1581211868.0,"No it’s fine. And yea I can actually agree about kanye lacking humility but there’s also the cultural context to consider. Rap culture sort of encourages being arrogant and never showing your soft side and Kanye seems tk take everything to the extreme. But I also understand how offputting his personality can be. I didn’t like him before I got into him either. And yes his Mother’s death did have a big impact on him. It does seem like everything started to really go down hill after that. And yes I really love Kanye, flaws and all, and feel a strong connection to him."

radiohead,fgryfp4,t1_fgrorsr,1581062611.0,"I have schizophrenia and Kanye acts a lot like I did when I had grandiose delusions. He’s been showing signs of it since at least 2013 too, when he was on the zane lowe show (again) talking about being a god. Npd looks more like Trump (grandiose, overt) or Taylor Swift (vulnerable, covert) IMO. I also think you would be surprised at how arrogant and grandiose Thom probably was at points in his life. You can see it in some of his lyrics and by the way that he talks about his past. He straight up talks about how he was “unbearable to be around” after creep hit and they went on their first tour. Lyrics like “tantrums and the chitty chats”, “I’ll drown my beliefs, to have you be in peace”, “treading on peoples toe, snot nose little punk” and others suggest that he would freak out on people and rant a lot. I think true love waits is sort of about him doing that but realizing it keeps pushing people away which is why he says he’ll drown his beliefs and act docile and doting  “dress like your niece and wash your swollen feet” if they just “don’t leave”. There’s a lot of other examples IMO but those are just the ones I have off the top of my head.

I also think Kanye took to Donald Trump for the same reason a lot of people do, because he felt rejected by society and joining Trump allowed him to feel accepted again and empowered against the society that rejected him. I’m not going to argue that he’s not very self-centered or that he probably didn’t do a bunch of douchey shit. But he also examine acting this way very finely with his art and you will never see that kind of honesty from a narcissist. If you look at Trump or Taylor Swift then you’ll notice that they never apologize or admit wrongdoing unless it’s yet another attempt to manipulate. Kanye actually owns up to his shit quite a bit, or at least he did before he went crazy. He apologized for the Taylor Swift incident and even acknowledged south park had a point about his ego. Which, btw, Taylor Swift 100% played the victim and subtly turned that whole debacle into something it didn’t need to be. 

But yea I respect your opinion too but I can see the humanity in Kanye. I really think he’s been psychotic since early in his career honestly and that his Messiah complex causes a lot of his shitty behavior. I was also personally inspired by Kanye to believe in myself and have confidence and speak my truth and believe in what I want to do and my personal vision even if other people don’t like it. I feel like that’s a big underlying theme in rap so I guess it was rap in general that inspired me but it all started with Kanye. He’s just one of those people that’s so unique and special and passionate and talented and funny that I can’t help but like him regardless of how he acts.

Edit: Kanye also has had addiction problems for a long time and that feeds assholish behavior. Thom was also an alcoholic and probably had his dickish behavior fed by that too."
radiohead,fgrh3vh,t1_fgqn50x,1581046665.0,They really liked Oracular Spectacular? I only kistened to it once and I didn’t think it was bad but it wasn’t good either. Thom doesn’t seem like the type that says shit just to be nice though.
radiohead,fgrgnuu,t1_fgqrywk,1581046351.0,"Yea but a lot of great artists have been ridiculous people. I think Kanye’s misunderstood too. I think he’s more insane than maliciously narcissistic. And some of his ridiculousness is a result of personality traits that I sort of adore him for, like how he always speaks his mind and has an incredible amount of self-belief. A lot of his ridiculous moments are just him being unable to really control those things to the point that they turn into negative traits in some moments. I also personally think Kanye has a sweet side and can empathize but is generally just too wrapped up in his own crazy inner world to properly do it unless it becomes one of the things he obsessed on (hard to explain what I mean). He even talks about being unable to say no when people want to borrow money on the song “Saint Pablo” (“My wife said I can’t say no to nobody and at this rate we gon’ both die broken. Got friends asking for money knowing I’m in debt and like my wife said I still didn’t say no”). There’s also a video of him crying about the death of a friend on the zane lowe show. Everyone thinks he’s this rambling, narcissistic prick but in reality he’s a sort of childish nerd underneath it all. And he also definitely has psychosis and honestly I think a lot of issues because of all the public ridicule and whatnot (even though he acts like he doesnt care).

I’m admittedly also a bias fanboy too though. I fucking love Kanye so much."
radiohead,fgrg7xq,t1_fgqyb0c,1581046040.0,Ooo the story said he did talk to Kanye at some point
radiohead,fgrfqbm,t1_fgrdxq4,1581045699.0,Lol that puts a nice picture in my head
unpopularopinion,fgrb9uf,t3_ezxpru,1581042626.0,"Yes and it’s funny because if they actually became super fucked up, they wouldn’t want it anymore. I’m schizophrenic and it’s so hard to deal with."
radiohead,fgqg265,t1_fgqf94a,1581023492.0,"I’m actually kinda surprised he wouldn’t talk to Kanye. Even if he doesn’t like him or everything he stands for then I would still assume Thom would have a lot of respect for his music. But I’m a huge Kanye fan and can’t see how anyone can not think his Music is brilliant or at the very least that MBDTF and Yeezus are. 

I heard that Thom did it to Kate Hudson too though. Everyone here’s probably heard the story but I guess she was trying to find a boyfriend in a band at some festival and she approached Thom but he ignored her so she went after Matt Bellamy.

Edit: But the Kate story is probably also an oversimplification from a gossip magazine or something"
PublicFreakout,fgnsvmc,t3_ezafh2,1580952174.0,Usually the bystanders in these videos are annoyinng but these ones were ok. Maybe I’m biased because I’m British but they didn’t seem as whiny or self-righteous.
unpopularopinion,fgnenkd,t3_ez9yt7,1580943246.0,"Yes it’s because we’re actually biologically expendable. One Man can create 100 babies in like a week but a woman can only create a baby every 9 months. Therefore we’re hardwired to see women as valuable for our survival but men not so much. Of course it’s just a primal bias that we could get over if society acknowledges It and brings it into our consciousness (from the unconscious). But as you said Society refuses to acknowledge or work on men’s issues.

It’s crazy because in the MeToo age a womaN could tell a story about hoW a guy touched her butt once 10 years ago and people would come to her defense and make the dude face what he did (important so the person can feel a sense of justice). Yet I went insane and eventually became a drug addict and all of that was set into motion by what a bpd and then an NPD girl did to me and society just doesn’t give a single fuck. The disparity is fucking gross.

Edit: Oh and you also have a bunch of dudes that act overtly feminist because they want to feel like good people and have women like them. They’re too chickenshit to stand up for their own people because they fear the consequences. And because they’re usually the guys who haven’t suffered enough that they’ll stand up for what they believe in regardless. So they go along with even the bullshit aspects of feminism and take womens side on everything. Meanwhile every dude who tries to challenge feminism on anything or bring up Men’s issues is labeled an extremist and ostracized. I agree with feminism but I also think it’s toxic when it oversteps it’s boundaries."
AskReddit,fgmcjwx,t1_fgjzowk,1580921972.0,NPD and no medications or therapies honestly are all that effective when dealing with it.
AskReddit,fgjz8nj,t1_fgjz5zb,1580854300.0,I think it’s crispin. Dunno who tf names their kid that but whatever.
unpopularopinion,fgifwy1,t1_fggxoou,1580820356.0,Honestly it was a good thing because it forced a lot of self-examination and positive change. Things never get bad enough for the average person to have to change so they spend their whole life in oblivious denial of all their shortcomings and with incredibly thin skin because they were never hardened by extreme adversity.
FanTheories,fgifozx,t1_fghqf3q,1580820140.0,"The point is that people couldn’t even have fathomed a thing like a smartphone, or the technology behind it, back then so we probably can’t even fathom the science behind the technology that will get us to other planets. Something could be discovered that changes everything. Plus they could also just build a ship they can basically live on to get to snother planet to get around the whole can’t move faster than the speed of light thing."
FanTheories,fgifi9t,t1_fghujcl,1580819960.0,Yea but the temperature changes we’re seeing right now are unprecedented compared to other temperature changes in history.
FanTheories,fghm7ih,t1_fghlw93,1580788014.0,Yea but technology builds on itself and you never know when some breakthrough scientific discovery will be made. People didn’t even really have electricity 100 years ago and now we all have little computer in our pockets that are all connected. Plus if the earth was doomed then it would probably still take a long time to actually get to the point where it’s uninhabitable. It’s like the titanic and how it took 4 hours to sink.
FanTheories,fghisjf,t1_fghinyo,1580785765.0,Probably in /r/conspiracy. I’ve seen real life theories here before though and /r/conspiracy is usually stuff with at least imagined evidence and not just random thoughts
unpopularopinion,fggxk40,t1_fggxaa6,1580771810.0,"I don’t but my brain is also somewhat fucked so I still get drawn back to wanting to seek attention from toxic women, especially when things get bad. It’s basically an attempt to reverse the trauma of having a mother that couldn’t love me properly. My brain thinks that if I can earn the love of someone like her, and possibly fix them, then it’ll be like earning the love of, and fixing my, mother. But yea I’ve avoided girls like that for a long time now and I haven’t talked to her in a while."
gifs,fgfyg2h,t3_exzum7,1580750337.0,I’m so sick of this hypersexualization shit in America. Honestly I think things like this are very unattractive
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgerc5p,t1_fgejoz9,1580707333.0,That’s NPD for you
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgerawh,t3_exxzjh,1580707301.0,Welcome to the world of NPD abuse. They shit all over your life and then convince everyone you’re the bad guy.
unpopularopinion,fg7tvf6,t1_fg7ttjd,1580601333.0,I feel like you’re a really sad and angry person underneath it all

unpopularopinion,fg7t99u,t1_fg7sndb,1580600900.0,Lol you just accused me of not loving women when I never said anything remotely close to that. You’re literally being ridiculous and can’t even see it.
unpopularopinion,fg7sivs,t1_fg7mufr,1580600381.0,Are you even reading the stuff you write or are you just sitting there with a list of insulting nouns and adjectives and picking them at random?
unpopularopinion,fg7kq8k,t1_fg7k780,1580594880.0,"Lol ok this is getting ridiculous. Think whatever you want because clearly I can’t have a reasonable discussion with you. And I love women and dont let my bad experiences convince me theyre all bad. And honestly they like me nowadays (and apparently they did before as well). Im usually the one running from them when they show interest.

I almost just wanna drop this because I know you’re just gonna flame me again but whatever go agead.  I can’t guarantee I’ll read it though."
unpopularopinion,fg7jxmj,t1_fg7jdri,1580594325.0,Lol you really don’t see anything wrong with your behavior? You’re just attacking me and stereotyping me when you know next to nothing about me. I bet the world is a lot easier if you take an oversimplified worldview. And I actually got quite good at socializing. I’m straight up charming when I’m feelin it nowadays. As long as I’m not super depressed or having an episode at least. And btw I still haven’t taken a single personal shot at you yet I’m the uncivilized one?
unpopularopinion,fg7j7br,t1_fg79a8x,1580593822.0,"Dude I dunno what’s wrong with you but it feels like you’re dumping your shit on me. And you’re putting words in my mouth. I’ve been around shit women that zi didnt think were npd or bpd. They do certain things that are dead giveaways but they’re also all complex and unique people. NPD girls are especially easy to spot. And what you’re saying is sort of horrible considering I went into psychosis soon after the discard phase and her war to destroy me. I feel like you’re the type that wouldve been saying the same invalidating stuff to a girl that was raped 30 years ago and it’s because you can’t picture things outside your own little ideological bubble.

Also, by conservative estimates, bpd and npd are 1% each. Which means that I’m probably taking a class with at least 1 bpd and npd female every semester. If I go to a popular club, there’s probably 3 or more of each. Plus they like to use online dating and stuff to find sources of supply so its easy to find them there. You also don’t understand the magnetic pull between a dosordered woman and someone who had a dosordered mother. Both the narcissist and the codependant are looking to repeat their parents relationship so theyre drawn to eachother. Before I reaixed this, I literally had an uncanny knack for always approaching the most fucked up girls. They were the only ones I felt comfortable around for the longest time as fucked up as that is. Add in that I was a drug addict who hung around with sketchy people, and that there are A LOT of disordered women (especially BPD) in those groups, and yea, I have had a fuck ton of run ins with bpd and npd girls.

Why do you think there’s these girls that just keep finding the same dudes when their dad was like that. It’s such a hard paytern to break. And honestly I’ve done a ton of work on myself and have grown up a lot and I’m really proud of myself so you can literally fuck off because you have no idea what you’re talking about."
unpopularopinion,fg79fyf,t1_fg78huo,1580587113.0,"Also if you realkt wanna know, this girl literally figured out I was psychotic and played into my delusions to make me worse. I actualky have empathy for her because she’s broken but she was a really horrible person."
unpopularopinion,fg78wkj,t1_fg78huo,1580586751.0,"The first one was diagnosed bpd and the other one was fairly textbook npd based on everything I’ve read (they rarely seek treatment kr get diagnosed). It makes sense when you consider that I had a narcissistic addict mother so I’m drawn to narcissistic addict women. I have had a few non cluster b women in my life too though but a lot of them were at least on the cluster b spectrum. I can usually tell when women are bpd/npd and when they’re not fairly quickly now. They all have certain tics that give it away. I also literally don’t ask this world for anything and I wasn’t even taking a “poor me” attitude. I learned that this world is never gonna hold my hand and that I have to earn everything I want by going through all that horrible shit. 

See how I argued my point without becoming insulting?"
unpopularopinion,fg6u9ca,t1_fg6u0zl,1580577010.0,Do you have any experience with cluster b disorders? Because you really shouldn’t talk if you don’t. Those people are so conniving it’s scary. And yes I didn’t think girls did shit like this wither which is why it was such a shock when it happened. And also why I can’t trust because now I know how easily someone can do that to me again.
unpopularopinion,fg6u1x6,t1_fg6tqlh,1580576874.0,"Lol go ask the dudes over on /r/narcissisticabuse and they’ll tell you. I once told her I wasn’t a big fan of gym-rat bro types (i dont mind them nkw) and that’s exactly what she went for as soon as thr discard happened. Believe whatever you want though, I don’t care"
unpopularopinion,fg6t78d,t1_fg6t401,1580576313.0,Yes and denying closure and using the silent treatment as a weapon is a tactic of abusers. They know the person will have trouble moving on without closure so they intentionally deny it. It’s why I see ghosting as basically just a form of abuse.
unpopularopinion,fg6t2rw,t1_fg6rvju,1580576235.0,Yea I’m pretty sure people are gonna look back on stuff like that in the future and think it was ignorant as fuck.
unpopularopinion,fg6sr4j,t1_fg6odud,1580576026.0,"Yea it’s a real problem but if like a black person gets wrapped in gang violence and then does bad shit then society will empathize and say how they’re a product of peer pressure and socioeconomic status or some shit (or liberals will at least). They don’t label them as all bad because of the harm they cause.

I 100% agree that stalking is a serious problem and that the lashing out is also a problem but ridiculing and labeling people is never gonna solve it. I also have known girls that have egged their stalker on endlessly though that’s admittedly probably very rare."
unpopularopinion,fg6sdgr,t1_fg6rs2i,1580575783.0,"You just don’t know what you’re talking about and aren’t properly empathizing. People almost always aren’t trying tk be bad and don’t want to be a monster or a freak. It’s almost always a result of very confusing circumstances. A lot of them are very far in denial so you can’t see their shame at what they are but it’s there. If you go through horrible enough shit and you turn into something you never thought you’d be, perhaps somethinf you used to judge even, then it gives you perspective and it becomes hard to judge anyone because you figure they’ve just been through shit you don’t understand. You also learn that you’re pain isn’t shit compared to some peoples, even if you’re a schizophrenic and former drug addict like I am. A lot of normal people act morally superior though because they’ve had the privilege of not being completely fucked by life. And because the average person is honestly really insecure and average yet simultaneously convinced theyre special so they put down others to maintain this fantasy.

And I didn’t type up an argument because you just repeated the same shit you said in the first post. You didn’t even acknowledge what I said. And you’re basically just regurgitating what eveeyone over at /r/niceguys said."
unpopularopinion,fg6rqe4,t1_fg6ongn,1580575361.0,Yes the subreddit is more about putting someone else down to feel better about themselves which is ironic because a lot of reddit act so morally superior over social causes. They’re engaging in the exact type of behavior that’s behind racism except it’s aimed at a target that’s socially acceptable to hate. Which is what a lot of the gtoups they stand up for now (black people) were  not too long ago. Basically Part of me thinks these people would’ve been racist say 100 years ago and that nice guys are just another outlet for their own feelings of inferiority and insecurity.
