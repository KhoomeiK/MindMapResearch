Psychosis,fgelggx,t3_ew2t5d,1580702451.0,"I just wonder if I will be able to hold down a job again because I am always tired nowadays on my meds and useless when these bouts of exhaustion hit so I can't see how I can be at a job (retail) everyday (or part time, rather) I also would like to freelance or sell art etc but it does require being pretty onto it.

The social side of a typical job is a draw because, personally anyway, psychosis manifests when I'm not being very social/am hiding away from everyone all day. Office politics and bullying at work is a whole other story.

But yes if they finally let me off my medication (probably won't happen until I get a job that isn't just volunteering) I would be firstly stoked about not having to swallow pills every day and night, and secondly concerned about another episode. The psychosis hasn't returned since I've been on meds although sometimes I have slightly paranoid thoughts.

I always wonder if I would think that ""they convinced me I was crazy cos they're all in a conspiracy against me"" if it ever returns. Is that quite common in returning psychosis do you think?"

Had trouble crossing roads that night/morning, there were just so many cars.

Everyone seems to be on something in my town, even if it's just weed. I'm almost surprised I don't get triggered just walking down the street lol. I hope being around friends smoking it won't trigger things, but ziprasidone seems to keep things in check.

schizophrenia,exkju5u,t1_et2qzmg,1566391694.0,"I gained half my weight from a month after my psychosis to now, nearly two years later, and I think it's gone up a little since I started quetiapine but that may have been from my diet getting worse for a few weeks. I was on olanzapene and lorazepam for less than a month to recover from psychosis, then olanzapene continued but lesser dose, until idk like mid 2018 (wild guess) and I've been on ziprasidone (Geodon in the US) for a while now, and added gabapentin for the anxiety.

So Idk what caused the weight gain but I'd guess it was olanzapene as it is stated as one of the antipsychotics with a high risk for weight gain. Ziprasidone is low risk apparently but I haven't gotten the weight off and I'm not doing that much differently to what I did exercise and foodwise when I was underweight pre-psychosis so I don't know what's going on. It might've been that the olanzapene caused significant weight gain over time, even after stopping taking it, and the ziprasidone had little effect on weight. I read olanzapene can cause weight gain even two years after you stop taking it. At least then there's hope on the horizon though.

TLDR: That was a bit of a hot mess and possibly doesn't help but just letting you know olanzapene can cause you to gain half your weight and ziprasidone doesn't necessarily make you lose weight/stop gaining weight üò≠ ü§∞"

I knew my relative had it and I flirted with the idea of thinking I might get it but I didn't really think I would. In an ideal world there would be no stigma attached and people would realize we are not violent criminals to be wary of and we are mostly medicated to the effect of a neurotypical person. The worst part is possible relapse and the overall medical costs which will potentially be with you for life and some people don't want to sign up for that I guess.

For a lot of us artists making art is a private and personal thing, let alone the schizophrenia which is really tied in with paranoia. The great thing is if we get some privacy to create, we can choose whether or not to share it afterwards.

I thought when I was making art in the ward that when I was colouring in the red represented blood and it was something to do with what they were gonna do to my body or something.

It's interesting cos I thought to myself, I seem schizophrenic or something to be filling so many pages in a day and I was thinking how much I would hate to be medicated and that it would stop me having art ideas.
