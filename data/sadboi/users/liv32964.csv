Buddhism,fcasgxu,t1_fca1lot,1577575729.0,Sorry for my long message. Hopefully that helps answer your question lol
Buddhism,fcaseio,t1_fca1lot,1577575692.0,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs letting go of stuff per se. it‚Äôs more like having no expectations of what will happen in the present or future moments. And then letting go of anger and salience of things that have happened in the past. I learned in Buddhism ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wish for this moment to be any different than it is.‚Äù Not labeling things as good/bad but instead taking and accepting things as they happen and as they are. 

I get what you‚Äôre saying about natural excitement I think. I went to a Buddhist meditation retreat in Thailand, in a jungle, sleeping on a 1in piece of plywood with a wooden pillow and a mosquito nest. It was a silent 7 day retreat and they had monks come in every morning and speak to us about Buddhist teachings. On day 3, they explained that we should not engage in singing/dancing or sleep on luxurious beds, etc, because we would get attached to that joy/comfort. This really rubbed me the wrong way because I didn‚Äôt agree with avoiding things just because they may cause us suffering after they are gone. I felt like having emotions (which may be defined as ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù for buddhists) is what makes us alive and human. So I actually left the retreat that day and spent the rest my trip engaging in activities that would excite my emotions (joy, eagerness, pain from a tattoo). I chose not to avoid things or refuse to engage in excitement. I allowed myself to feel those emotions and when they went away, I wasn‚Äôt angry or upset because I kept telling myself ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wish for this moment to be any different than it is‚Äù. 

So I think the biggest thing in the book, and other related Buddhist teachings, in relation to your question is that they don‚Äôt want you to get *attached* to joy/happiness/materialist things, etc because you hold such a strong attachment then you aren‚Äôt going to be able to handle life when those things go away. For example, I‚Äôve alway been told that family will be there for you no matter what. So if I ever got into a car accident, I would call my family, expecting them to be there for me or come pick me up or console me but they never would and I would be freaking out not knowing what to do. And it caused me so much stress, anger, and frustration because I was so attached to how things ‚Äúshould‚Äù have been. Letting go of that attachment through Buddhism, I had to ensure that I could take care of myself in that situation because I understood and accepted that my family will never be there for me. So now, if I get into an accident or have car trouble, I, myself, am fully sufficient in handling it myself."
Buddhism,fc9ofae,t1_fc90tzs,1577555746.0,"From my perspective, it gives scenarios on different topics that could cause ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù and how fundamentals of Buddhism could apply to how one perceives and reacts to those situations. The biggest thing I got from it was that my expectations of how things should be or how people should treat me, was causing a lot of my depression, resentment, and anxiety. It really hit the nail on the head describing how all suffering comes from attachment‚Äîthere‚Äôs a great section where it uses a monkey and a banana to explain that concept. I‚Äôm 24 now and I still think about this book so I would say it‚Äôs still impactful. It‚Äôs a very easy read too. I gave my recent copy to a professor of mine, so your reply just reminded me to buy myself a new copy. (Found a used copy on Amazon for $7)."

BPD,fadfdro,t3_e8m5nn,1575968577.0,It‚Äôs really interesting seeing some of the comments say that birth control has helped regulate emotions. I‚Äôm currently doing research on hormonal contraceptives and potentially increased risk of anxiety but you guys gave me a new perspective
BPD,fadf3pe,t1_faddjnn,1575968150.0,"Agreed! I‚Äôve read about BPD having high levels of dissociation symptoms. For me personally, I only have memories linked to states of mind/mood swings. If I‚Äôm triggered by abandonment, once I get triggered every single memory connected to abandonment floods my mind. When I feel dismissed or invalidated, every memory linked to dismissal or invalidation floods my mind, etc etc. And then when my brain returns to normal state, I have absolutely no recollection of any of those memories. Maybe I can force myself to think of them but there won‚Äôt be emotion attached to it. It‚Äôs the strangest thing to describe. (Not sure if it‚Äôs similar to what you are referring to). But yeah, I think since the mood swings in BPD are rooted in an intense flood of emotion then the memories/situations get documented/filed in our brain with that emotion. Not sure if I‚Äôm explaining it in an understandable way."

BorderlinePDisorder,f8a22dl,t1_f89o0e4,1574385656.0,"My dissociation was so bad that my professors would be lecturing, I would start writing down what they just said (trying to hold it in my mind as I‚Äôm writing it down). I could only manage to write two or three words until I would COMPLETELY forget what they said. Absolute blank. Not a single chance of me remembering what they just said a few seconds prior. So ALL of my class notes were incomplete and it was very difficult for me because I was trying my hardest to hold it in my mind but it would completely disappear a few seconds later. I knew it was from my BPD and the dissociation from trauma but I didn‚Äôt tell my doctor. I just told him what I was experiencing in class with the inability to hold on to the lecture and just doodling on my papers after giving up trying to remember. He diagnosed me with attention deficit disorder and prescribed vyvanse. Adderall never worked for me because it put me to sleep within 10 minutes of taking it. Vyvanse has been the only effective thing for me. Vyvanse lasts longer and there is no crash like with adderall."
BorderlinePDisorder,f8a1hb0,t1_f89o0e4,1574385206.0,I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs prescribed for dissociation specifically but my symptoms of zoning out lined up with an ADD diagnosis which vyvanse is usually prescribed for.

BorderlinePDisorder,f88lrid,t3_dzlhjy,1574356829.0,Yes! I went to contacts to help the dissociation but they made my eyes tired so I went back to glasses. Then I got prescribed vyvanse to help with my dissociation and it has helped a lot. But I totally understand what you mean about it feeling like a movie
BPD,f7jyjin,t3_dwev10,1573789774.0,"My memory has been terrible too but I think it‚Äôs because I experience a lot of dissociation. After my suicide attempt in 2012, I experienced major dissociation of feeling like I actually did die. Since then, and with all my other trauma, my brain has to maintain a dissociative state because I can‚Äôt handle the memory of my traumas so it makes my daily memory worse. I actually did research and people with BPD experience higher dissociation compared to people with anxiety, depression, etc. I actually had to get on Adderall/vyvanse to keep my mind alert so I wouldn‚Äôt dissociate as much."
