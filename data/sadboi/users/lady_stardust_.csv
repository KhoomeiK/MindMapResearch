People can change even the most deeply ingrained parts of themselves for the better, and this can happen at any point in a relationship - it just takes work. If you and/or your SO aren’t willing to recognize the problem or do the work, that’s another story. But the idea that marriage somehow cements negative traits is just not accurate.
