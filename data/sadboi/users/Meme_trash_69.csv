   Unfortunately, its very hard for a dad to get custody of a child, its usually the woman who gets her way but I advise talking to a lawyer about it. Set up the best case before signing the divorce papers so you already have a good case. Collect evidence in secret to support your claims cause its the best chance you have.
     I wish the best for you and your daughter and that your wife ((or ex-wife)) gets what's coming to her."

depression,fbfjkff,t3_eczhm3,1576812154.0,"This is probably late but I'll pitch in my two cents anyway. Your family doesn't treat you like family and if you dread having to go and hang out with them on Christmas then it isn't worth it. You'll feel miserable and guilty for the entire gathering, your family don't seem like they care, cause if they did they would gladly let you celebrate for a little at their house andlet you go, heck if they were actually family they would go with you to visit that friend ((if the friend felt comfortable with it))
I assure you you will not be ruining Christmas for them, they only want to manipulate you by saying this to be able to get their way. I'm sure your friend would really appreciate your visit. I wish you and everyone else here the best."
