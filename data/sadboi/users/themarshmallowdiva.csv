The advice I received was treated like gold, and afterwards when I spoke to my therapist -- she told me that I was being convinced to 'separate them, and singulation'. I smiled and nodded, but looked up singulation later (as I didn't know what it meant, albeit I had a solid idea).   
I'm not expecting alters combining to be 'gobbling up one another'.  It just means that we combine healthily enough, where each persona is itself, and we combine happily, and heathily. So they are parts of me (host), and I am parts of them.

I understand the duplicity or multiplicity of our behaviours, alters, and how our integration is necessary, but patience, and kindness, helps. Being told to separate ourselves completely, has not been great advice.

She's been a wonderful client previously -- and left me a wonderful review -- but this -- it's unusual for her. I just don't know how to express to a previous, loving, kind client, that I cannot sacrifice myself. If I had known her children were unvaxxed, I wouldn't have ever allowed them in my studio. -sighs- I know anti-vaxxers talk about not believing the hype -- but I got shingles when a kid with no symptoms, had chickenpox or something. It was... rough. I required plastic surgery to literally fix my face because of the holes the shingles left behind."
aww,fkyz3ms,t1_fkwee4s,1584659217.0,INTERNATIONAL.
WTF,fkyz26t,t1_fkwizkd,1584659192.0,"That's what my best friend does, and she has to remind people not to tell the WHOLE story, just what is going on RIGHT NOW. 

She has to raise her voice and go, ""ARE YOU INJURED, TELL ME WHY ARE YOU CALLING 9-1-1 right now SIR/MA'AM?"""
WTF,fkyyv8h,t1_fkx1n8l,1584659073.0,"It's true, shock is a CRAZY drug. It really messes with your head."
WTF,fkyyt6k,t1_fkx5rhg,1584659037.0,"This is pretty much what happened to me with my ankle. I missed a single step (both feet), screamed blood murder originally, then was making jokes about making white-girl-rap-group called ""Clumsy by Nature""."
WTF,fkyymj2,t1_fkxbjnm,1584658923.0,"It might have been me from my old account. I lost the password, and had to recreate my account three years ago."
WTF,fkw8xku,t1_fkw2caq,1584586247.0,"Shock is a crazy thing. My best friend works in dispatch and she says that she'll ask people what's happened ans they'll often be like, So my friend was going out for his bachelor party and his fiance got mad--and she has to interrupt them and ask WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? And they go, OH I got stabbed. Shock is a helluva drug."
depression,fkw4kge,t3_fl010g,1584583315.0,There are places where doctors do their appointments online and telephone. My own PTSD doctor offered to switch to phone calls or video calls. Hopefully you can find a doctor that will do you justice this way perhaps?

tipofmytongue,fkq0vsk,t3_fjw59k,1584425984.0,Might be the Supremes. This combo? https://youtu.be/-kBQ8DgkyFk
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkokq96,t1_fkng8se,1584389156.0,"Exactly. Didn't want to accept them/it, so I didn't."
relationship_advice,fkohqxm,t1_fkna3db,1584387466.0,I am so sorry that happened to you. I hope that your brain heals and eventually you can feel your emotions again instead of the void. We definitely need some serious reform. It is a masterpiece of film to me and really gets its points across while showing the emotion everyone suffered through and experienced. It's a very powerful documentary.
relationship_advice,fkm0oyp,t1_fklzh60,1584318667.0,I completely empathize. I have seen it more than twice and I cry like a bitch and need to take a walk every time at a certain point in the movie. I just... It's extremely hard to handle. And to know that my government (Canadian) kept her safe here. Infuriating and heartbreaking. We had a man rape a child here and he got three years. One and a half with good behaviour. The... Justice system is flawed in so many ways.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkly2rf,t1_fklxqx2,1584317093.0,"Adopted actually. ;) LOL She tried to be my teacher and was for the first year until I turned six. Then I had to get a piano teacher because get this, slapping the tops of your five year old's hands with a ruler when they mess up their fingering is surprisingly upsetting for a child. LOL"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fklxw9p,t1_fklxbwq,1584316983.0,The first doctor screwed me over but the second one did so amazing that we cancelled the third consult and I see her in person on Tuesday.
JUSTNOFAMILY,fklxqt0,t1_fklx7c4,1584316890.0,Sokay love I just I just got lost no biggie. :) You can always try again with the last part. Smaller paragraphs. Due to my PTSD my short term memory is kind of a mess so if you break it up a little I'm more likely to retain what was said.. Not your fault at all. :)
relationship_advice,fklwkej,t1_fklqyco,1584316157.0,"I have too. I've introduced it to so many friends. Talhotblonde, Catfish, and off topic but Dear Zachary. It just shows how manipulative and disgusting people can be."
curlyhair,fkj58j4,t1_fkj3vp6,1584236536.0,Thank you so much! ^_^ <3
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkivtn3,t1_fkiuhje,1584229840.0,"I totally understand chronic pain --- but thankfully I don't have RSD/CRPS! Explaing spoon theory over and over and over is frustrating as absolutely HECK! Thank you so much for reading my stories! The community here is so supportive, it's gotten me through some really tough days!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkir73t,t1_fkir3sx,1584226701.0,"No worries, I haven't shared any GFM links, and whenever someone asks, I tell them I don't want us to get into trouble, as this sub has saved me from going absolutely crazy time and time again! <3"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkipm83,t1_fkipjkg,1584225620.0,Thank you so very much! The kindness and support of this community has gotten me through many rough days! <3 <3 <3
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkionnt,t1_fkiof9n,1584224967.0,"According to my audiologist, Tara, the only time they give you is six months to finance, which means a grand a month -- which we may end up doing this through crowdfunding AND that. I'll ask hubs to look at Care Credit, he's good with numbers, and  may have a better understanding of it! Thank you for telling me about this, we'll look into it right away!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkimeab,t1_fkikziw,1584223440.0,She really does. She just exacerbates everything! That's why I keep minimum contact as best as I can!
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkimc7p,t1_fkikfe8,1584223401.0,"I would be HONOURED, and would LOVE that more than you know! <3"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkimaes,t1_fkilmaj,1584223367.0,"Thankfully my SO knows how much she exhausts me, and he keeps me sane with cuddles, random junk food, and occasionally bringing home alcohol for the days I know I'll truly need it. He's my rock. I think I would've shmooshed someone by now if he weren't here."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkikx2d,t1_fki9ezt,1584222435.0,"((HUGS)) Virtual hugs are much safer than the real thing these days, so this works out!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkikvm6,t1_fkift7x,1584222407.0,"She's an emotional/mental vampire. It's exhausting. I focused on my art for two and a half hours, then had to lay down for a nap. Depression nap 101. I've just woken up. Still feel exhausted, but I'm guessing I'll be going to bed early tonight despite the nap."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkikpo7,t1_fkijtai,1584222296.0,"Anxiety meds, I swear. It's like the one thing that keeps me from yelling at her. And from past experience. If you upset her, raise your voice, or confront her, you become problem #1 and have to be dealt with. Through FMs, or through constant barrages of e-mails, phone calls, other family members, etc. It's just exhaustive, so you let her 'win' by staying calm. After writing this, I tried to focus on my art -- but after about two and a half hours, I felt randomly drained and needed a long nap. I've just woken up now.  Depression naps. -smdh- Thankfully it helped a little."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkikev5,t1_fkija28,1584222096.0,"I really should have. I kept grey rocking, and kept it short. After hearing the news that she wasn't leaving, it took a lot of wind out of my sails. Just exhaustive to know that a month of freedom and no contact disappeared just like that! -snaps her fingers- With everything else on the table, I was really looking forward to that!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkik9ht,t1_fkij1pf,1584221997.0,"I would! No question! We're still saving up for a new pair -- as I can control them through bluetooth (do they take the typical hearing aid batteries?) and they connect to my phone and make life much easier that way! I would get them moulded so that I have the pair, logically, I don't think ANYONE could refuse such an amazing offer! <3"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fkghk8k,t1_fkgcmut,1584159954.0,I up voted you myself. I think that genuine questions and wanting to learn great!
delusionalartists,fkgfq4j,t3_fi9yg0,1584158351.0,I genuinely want to see the comments sections of some of these. Like really really badly.
