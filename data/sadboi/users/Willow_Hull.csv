I used 2 parts alcohol, 1 part aloe, 5 drops of eucalyptus oil and about half a teaspoon of tea tree oil that was pre diluted with a carrier oil that I had used on my braids some time ago. 

I have a ninja blender so i used that to break up the aloe. If you've played with aloe before you know it's very hard to separate. You can whisk it until it breaks up but you'll be at it for a while. Even so you'll still end up with a bit of plant matter afterwards. You can scoop it out or leave it. Your choice.

I know it's easier said then done. Sometimes when I'm having a particularly hard time I try manifesting by going somewhere quiet, taking a deep breath, and telling myself that while there is darkness around me there is light inside me and good things will come to the light.

I can relate to your experience with what you call a demon. I suffered greatly as a teen from depression and when you have underlying issues you become more susceptible to dark spirits. I had my own tour of duty with a dark spirit (I was 15 when it started 19 when i got it completely under control.) and what I can tell you is you can ask for all the signs and help you want, but the Gods, or God, or Angels or whatever you believe in will not save you. They can help you, guide you, make you feel supported but it will always come back to you. You have to be strong enough to help yourself. No one will close the hole you opened for you.

Even if you dont subscribe to the ""beyond the veil"" stuff, subconsciously it seems like you've accepted her death, made peace with the fact that you couldn't be there and are ready to mourn her with joy rather than sadness.

I'm not sure if it's the same for everyone, but I am twice as susceptible to encounters and experiences when I am sleepy. So for a long time when I was a teen and had no control my bedroom became a torture chamber. Eventually I became religious about protecting that space. I have been practicing this routine for almost ten years. 

Firstly,  any time I move I sage my whole house, but I give extra attention in my room. I make sure from day one that anyone and everyone knows my room is my quiet place. After I sage, I then meditate and expand my psychic bubble so that it fills the entire room, being sure to recite my intentions firmly either outloud or in my head. The next thing I do is hang a talisman on my door. I am a strong believer that you can project energy into objects so I try to meditate on light, positivity and protection while holding my piece of choice, then hang it on my door. Occassionally I will also salt my doorway but only when I feel the energy in my home is particularly heavy. 

After my initial move in routine, I try to ""spring clean"" and repeat these steps at least once a year. Additionally, before I go to bed I cover all mirrors in my room.

I was little and still didnt understand the concept of spirits. He built our family home with his bare hands and I've been rather distressed this past year because when my brother came home from college he started talking about how he was going to tear my grandparents house down when they died, which we got into a not so delightful, loud discussion about. My great grand parents and my great uncle all died in that house, my grand parents will probably die there, and I was also married on the property so it's a very important to me. I see both of my greats there frequently, even my dingbat brother who denies being able to see, is terrified because of how present they are (which is why he wants to tear it down, hard eye roll).

Wicca,fg3a70l,t3_ewdh67,1580475908.0,"I always say that if you can remember your dream in duch detail like that it wasnt a dream it was a journey. I'm an intuitive, I've been chatting with dead since before I can even remember, so I've always been sort of close to the veil. But I didnt find the Gods until I was thirteen and meditated for the first time. I went on a pretty interesting ride that first time which is way too long of a story to tell, but ever since then once a month I get these very vivid dreams where I am visited by what I believe to be deities. 

I am closest with Hecate. When I was a teen I was really struggling with my gift. My family moved into a house that used to be a part of our local funeral home and it was very haunted. There was one spirit in particular that was extremely violent and I didn't really know how to protect myself st the time. Well naturally my mother thought I was insane and took me to doctor after doctor after doctor. It was a really painful portion of my life. (Ten years later she finally believes me and actually practices  some form of paganism herself, so it all worked out). At any rate, my many therapists introduced me to meditation and thereafter  I started having dreams around every full moon of a woman. She would take me places and show me things, usually about death, sometimes about war, it really varies but it seems her intention has always been to lead me. During my very first encounter (outside meditation because she does not speak with words when I meditate) she came to me and stood under the full moon, with a snake draped around her shoulders and told me that I would face many difficulties on my course but if I ever felt lost I could look to the moon for help and she would guide me. 

So that's what I've done ever since! 

She never told me her name, but after researching the symbolism I thought it had to be Hecate. So I decorate my alter with snake figurines and I carve her wheel into my meditation candles. She has always kept good on her word and continues to guide me, even when I'm reluctant. 

Sometimes I think maybe I am mad. But half a decade of doctors conclude that I'm perfectly sane, and if my entire life experiance has all been in my head theres a bigger thought process to be had here.

So that's the short(ish) version of my story. 
My advice to you would be to follow your deity in whichever ways they lead. In my opinion there isnt a correct way to honor your guides, they know your intentions. Be patient, let your intentions be known and the rest will follow. You will find your way."

I beleive in many Gods, but my diety is Hecate. It is with her I am the closest.  I call her by that name in particular because that was the first connection I was able to make. She came to me in meditation when I was thirteen. Then again and again in my dreams. She never once, to this day, told me her name. I sought her out by symbol and research. I simply found greek lore first. However I personally am a believer that all of these Gods, in every culture and religion are one in the same. How humans chose to translate the channeling of the Gods will always differ because no two people and cultures are exactly the same. Humans change, grow and evolve. They sometimes have ambitions that can change what they believe the Gods are saying. Sometimes they dont feel the Gods at all but still speak on them regardless. Humans change in circumstances, but the Gods remain. 

That's how I feel about it ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The Triple Goddess: It depends on who you ask. Some will tell you that Hekate is the triple goddess and you only need invoke her, some will say that each is her own ie Hecate, Artemis, Selene. And some people like the one on this thread will say it is just something made up by Robert Graves in 1948 to sell a book. 

I choose to subscribe to the Gods because I feel them in all things. If you were Christian and you went to a church but you didnt really like it, or feel the message would you still go? If you read scripture and thought they were just empty words, would you continue to read them? If you prayed to God and felt no vibrations from him, no response, no love, would you still pray?  

The biggest part of any religion is faith, my friend. If you believe, then they are with you always. If you want to pray in your mind, that's fine, they hear you. If you would like to shout it from the roof tops and perform intricate rituals that's great!  Further, not every Wiccan travels with the Gods and that's okay too. 

In conclusion, do what you'd like. Do what feels right. When I am uncertain i find meditation can provide guidence, especially since that's how I found the Gods in the first place. When you find what is right for you, you will know. You will feel the vibrations, I'm certain. 

This is probably not the response you wanted. But I hope you find some clarity on your journey. I might suggest you do some reading to find out what vibrates with you. 

Try ""Wicca for Beginners"" by Thea Sabin, if you havent already! Reading may help you carve out your path and help you figure out what you believe.

Hecate,ffqog3w,t3_euit9q,1580139891.0,"I quit my job back in October for the same exact reasons. I was seeing a lot of signs not just spiritually, but practically, that my job was not leading me on a good path anymore. It had taken me to where I was meant to go but it was time for a change. I consulted my tarot cards waaaaay too many times before I made my decision and it got to the point that the Gods were screaming at me JUST DO IT!! 

Once I did, it was like a massive weight was lifted. Plus, now that I am no longer a slave to the machine I found much more time to delve into my spirituality and Hecates guidence which is a bonus. 

When I invoke Her, I usually meditate by my alter i light three black candles and I like to carve Hecates wheel or other relevant sigils/runes into them. I also have a little metal snake that I wrap around the base of the center candle, just because it feels right. I also made a spell bag with dandelion root as the base to help invoke her.

Some may disagree with me, but I feel there's no correct way to set up an alter or a shrine or whatever you may do to honor the Gods. You should just convey your intentions the best you can! Be it in thought, out loud, at home or in nature, your efforts will be noticed. 

Best of luck on your journey, friend!"
Wicca,ffg533s,t3_et783k,1579898637.0,"In my experiance, it is best to not seek out the gods, theyll find you on their own as you evolve in your practice. As far as ""god drama"" I personally dont believe in such a thing. In my humble opinion the Gods are the Gods despite their differing names in these seperate cultures. Follow what calls to your heart.  Maybe meditate on it."
Hecate,feszwnf,t1_fes71k4,1579370508.0,"To be clear, although my dream was graphic I dont think Hecate or either diety that appeared intended to instill any sort of harmful fear in me. It is my own shame that inspires that thought process. I do think the shock factor was meaningful. There have been some developments in my life that are helping to paint a clearer picture. I also am very curious about the other deities in my dreams. I have only ever known experiances with Hecate alone. She was motherly towards me at a time in my life when my own earthly mother was not. In any case I hope I am blessed enough to see the many faces of Hecate in my life time, if and when she decides I need to. Thank you for your insights!"
IndigoChildren,eyz0oai,t1_eyyp95d,1567606765.0,"Thanks for the tips!

I use oils and herbs regularly, I prefer to keep my health regiments more natural because drug use has been a big problem in my family. I watched my mom struggle with prescription sleeping medication while I was young which is why I'm so against it. I have tried St Johns Wart and it actually makes me more vivid. I haven't looked in to the other two you mentioned though so I'll have to do some research on that. I've been dealing with this for quite some time so I have a pretty regular routine before bed, with my tea and oils, which help a little, but not like it used to. No sleep apnea problems as far as I know.

I do struggle with anxiety and some mild depression, so a cortisol issue could be a big possibility here. My mother says I was hyper aware and anxious basically as soon as I was able to walk and talk. The amount of time I spend with others does have a huge effect on me, so maybe the extra energy intake is just exacerbating an issue I already had. Again I choose not to medicate, I did for maybe 6 or 7 years before I decided to just live with it rather than jumping from med to med and being numbed out all the time. 

I will definitely look into some of the things you mentioned, though. Thanks again!"
IndigoChildren,eyymqqs,t1_eyxyc8b,1567594916.0,"I'm an American,  I live in NH. So the woods basically lol.  I used to kind of live in the middle of nowhere but when I got married I moved where the work is. So I have to deal with a lot more people and energy now than I had to before which may be contributing. I also try to stay away from the news as much as I can cause that doesnt help either.  

If I had it my way I'd be right back in the middle of nowhere, but that's not what the universe wants for me rn I guess."
IndigoChildren,exg0sdb,t3_cry1tr,1566252831.0,"I said this on a different post on this sub but I'll say it again at the risk of repeating myself. One of the hardest lessons to learn is that there is no helping anyone if you exhaust yourself. Avolation has it 100% you need to give yourself time to recharge! Taking time for you is not as selfish as it can seem. The best thing you can do for yourself and those around you is to have peace with yourself and the universe, only then can you extend a firm helping hand. I have a hard time meditating myself, but I do try to free write. That's what makes me feel most aligned. Find what aligns you and use it!

Also, there's nothing wrong with you. That would imply that there are folks out there who are ""right"" or perfect and that's not the case. Were all just swimming along on this journey down the cosmic river. I hope you and your family find some sort of peace within yourselves. (I know easier said than done!)"
IndigoChildren,ex97fla,t3_crmdh5,1566084660.0,"You're making total sense! I get energy over load A LOT! Any time I go to a place that hosts many people or heavy vibrations I start to feel Ill. Funerals, parties, hospitals, concets, even in department or grocery stores are all examples of places where I've reached my limit. It's kinda just one of those things that come with being empathic. The important part is knowing your limits and when to take care of yourself. You cant help anyone else if you're emotionally drained."
IndigoChildren,ewkyebv,t3_bo2uqf,1565498641.0,"I definately see your point on fear and the flow of the universe. I am also in my early twenties and while I feel an old soul, there is a certain fear and distrust that lives inside me that causes this immense friction between myself  and the universe. I'm still learning how to let go of my human urges if that makes sense. I think the reason it's so scary though is because were so trained to observe and experience things a certain way and when we start to open ourselves up and see this other state of being, people automatically feel like they're going mad. I sure did..... I believe there are many lying dormant letting fear and control get the best of them. Sometimes it still gets the best of me. Although these are things I've thought about and juggled around my whole life I still feel I'm just beginning.  

Hopefully that didnt sound like a ramble! I'm just off work and need a good recharging."

IndigoChildren,erfol4u,t1_er5mxk8,1560813716.0,"I've been ruminating the past couple of days on that thought about fear. That's a truth that I hadn't fully come to terms with myself. There is so much fear in the world and it truly hinders our progress not just as indigo/crystal folks but humanity as a whole. Honestly just from knowing that there are others who think and feel the way I do has made me feel so powerful! And I mean that in a personal way. Like the knowing has given me the power to conquer fears that have a false control over my life. And perhaps, as you alluded, that's what it's all about....

I will definately check out the books you recommended, thank you!"
