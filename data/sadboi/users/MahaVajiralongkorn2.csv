I've been off from work since January 20th and I doubt I'll be back on the clock until March at some time.

Let me just say that I'm apparently getting paid for my unwanted holiday. I'd honestly be at work, not so much because I like working. More because I don't like the reasons I'm not working. 

Still, I've found myself learning morse code, studying for a HAM radio license exam, reading and reading and more reading.

I'll be fine.

At least I have time to do the entire Minuteman play through of fallout 4, can't complain. 

At least I don't have to teach online classes, I think I'd turn my phone off and ignore everyone until they said it was all clear to come into work.

Going to put this out there for you sweethearts, Do not let your schools push you around during this mess. Recruitment of new teachers is going to be a mess for a while. Not saying that you need to take advantage of it, but don't be a doormat either. 

I think my school knows if they don't pay me, I'm walking. I don't care if I'm not working, I'm certainly not at liberty to go outside my apartment. The school can eat this expense as one of those operating costs that come up from time to time. The very first mention of them wanting to jerk me around about my salary, I'm gone. I'm in a school where they are looking at losing 2/3rds of their foreign teacher staff as it is, they can respect the fact that I stayed when others bolted. 

Not that I blame them for bailing, this isn't a fun situation to be caught in. I went through this with swine flu in 2009, so I have a bit of a frame of reference for all this. 

Yet, I gotta say, this one is far worse in terms of numbers and the Chinese response to it. 

Anyhow, unpucker your booty holes and get busy entertaining yourselves. Remember, you are gonna be alright, statistically speaking, unless you are trading spit with a someone that says, ""Covid-19 patient"" you are very unlikely to catch it. 

SO relax yall."

I find the casual manner in which a number of posters have dismissed your son's anger problems as if it were an isolated incident a bit off putting. I struggle with other problems, they are persistent, and something I've been dealing with for over two decades. They are present within me everywhere I go. Things really do build up from time to time and I find myself treading water in much deeper water than usual if you get what I mean. I can't say I precisely understand what is going on with your son, but I reckon I can at least get a ballpark sort of understanding. 

Getting your son into therapy and working with him to help him learn to control his anger at a younger age is giving him an amazing leg up on life. 

I won't go as far to say his anger issues are an excuse for him breaking something. In the very near future, he's going to be living in an adult world with adult consequences. You are doing the right thing by returning the responsibility back where it belongs.

Now... I know how it goes with being absolutely frustrated beyond belief with someone and responding in a less than optimal manner. At some point I'd sit down with him and tell him exactly how the situation made you feel. I wouldn't go as far to apologize as I don't believe you have anything to apologize for. 

BUT.. I think he needs to know how his anger issues make others around him feel. It's information that with time and help he'll need to take in and really make the effort to expand on his understanding of why he needs to get control of his anger. 

I'm guessing he knows why on a personal level how his anger hurts him, but this is a good opportunity to show him how it hurts others, specifically you. 

Just try not to make him feel guilty about it. At least in my experience, lasting change has rarely come from feeling guilty."

However, like I said, I'd tell Josh when you are certain he's ready for that sort of news. If you think he can cope with it now, tell him now. If you think he can't, tell your Uncles and Aunts that as the person who has raised him, you'll be telling him when you think he's ready for it.

The biggest learning curves for me in TEFL weren't the fiddly bits of educational theory. There wasn't whole lot of theory involved where I first worked and there still isn't where I work now many years later. 

The parts that absolutely wrecked my big ol' behind were developing a classroom presence and learning how to work with the students. I came from the corrections industry.. sort of.. and much of what I had to unlearn was the mania for retaining complete control over every single situation. 

We all have different things to learn and develop as a teacher. What I had to unlearn/learn might be a lot different from you.

Families and friends often don't quite get that depression and BPD aren't like the common cold. They don't just go away. 

I guess the question I would ask myself is as follows: if you were in the hospital who would likely spend Christmas day with you? 

Your friend or your family? 

Family often times is who you choose to surround yourself with and invest your own time in. Your bio-fam really does not sound very supportive. Perhaps they are suffering from sort of fatigue regarding your ongoing struggles with BPD? People who don't have a basis to understand your struggles are apt to get worn out with your struggles far faster than someone who does have a basis for understanding. 

Think of empathy of existing in a cup that comes in flavors. My flavor and your flavor is similiar enough that the taste of it doesn't repulse me. Hearing about your problems with depression would be something I would compare to my own struggles and we'd talk about it. 

My long term ability to support you would depend on how full my cup is so to speak. I say this having suffered from empathy burn out, a few times, in the past from support roles. My capacity for empathy has limits and I personally set boundaries with the people I support. 

My big boundary being I'm never on call for emergencies. If someone I am supporting is that badly off, I tell them they need to seek medical help before we have a sit down. 

I personally don't do trauma bonding. Though, not going to lie, have been there and done that. It's gross and ultimately destructive. 

There are more boundaries I have for myself. Further, I'm going way off point and veering all over the place. 

I'm not trying to make excuses for your family. Even if their cup has run dry, there is no excuse for the way they are speaking to you. Your friend needs someone to drop in and see her, whether this is you or someone else it really doesn't matter.

She really needs someone to drop in and visit the next day, the day after that, and so forth. 

I would suggest looking at the bigger picture and asking around to find out who is up for setting up some sort of schedule of visitations to make sure someone drops by at least once a day. 

You don't need to spend all day with your friend, I'd personally show up in the morning, leave after lunch, and then head on down to Christmas dinner. As it is your family and they sound like douches, I'd minimize the total amount of time I spent with them anyway.

I've been coping with depression for over 25 years. I know what to do to deal with it, I manage with it just fine, and falling into the pit is part of the process. 

I don't know how long you've been struggling or coping with depression. I'll say this and if it applies great, if not.. feel free to ignore.

There came a time when I just stopped feeling so bad about falling into the pit and accepted it as part of my life. I learned to start keeping my eyes open for the signs I'll be doing that double gainer/backflip into shitsville and if I was lucky, I managed to avoid or at least mitigate darkness the pit. 

I think I manage to avoid the pit about 50 percent of the time. 30 percent of the time, I've learned ways to leverage myself out of it faster. The last 20 percent of the time, well.. let's just say those aren't the most pleasant of times. 

It comes with time, persistence, and honestly for me.. the key was acceptance. I accepted that being depressed is something that isn't likely to go away on its own. I accepted that my depression is mine alone to learn to cope with. 

Blaming others had to go as it was leading me to some very dark places. Believe me, I blamed a lot of other people for my problems over the years Other people didn't make me feel depressed, it was/is some sort of chemical imbalance of the brain with a heap of childhood issues thrown in there for good measure. 

Accepting that my depression is a forever sort of deal, led me to thinking about how to make it less of a pain in my ass. 

Something I learned was to remember, that what works for others may well not work for me. The processes and tools I came to discover that work for me, came about through trial and error. A lot of error, so much error, but failing after a while became a means of eliminating what didn't work and identifying what does work. 

I don't know you, so me saying I'm proud of you would seem a bit odd, at least it would for me. I do know what it is like being at my lowest and having someone explain to me all I have to do is xyz to feel better.

So many times I've wanted to say, ""As if you know my struggle you complete @#$#.""

Hmm, maybe I should say that more, it surely would feel good. Though, in the long run it would probably be a really bad idea.

I figure once I've done it once or twice, my planning time drops significantly as I become more familiar with the unit and my objectives become clearer. As I said, I then switch to supplementing the content to make it a bit more interesting for me and furthering those objectives."

With that in mind, hone your observational abilities in the classroom. Keep your eyes moving and keep assessing your student's level of understanding on the fly.

Assessment is something teachers, myself included, struggle with at times. We make this absolutely kick ass lesson, roll it out, and then come to the conclusion 3/4ths of the way through that at least half the students have no idea what is going on.

Concept checking questions are important, but asking them so that you aren't making your students uncomfortable and shutting them down even more important. 

One thing I've learned... the hard way.. a few times... over and over again.. is assessment can come in a variety of guises and need not be so obvious as me asking a question. 

Beyond that, have fun with your volunteering, I wish more people would get into literacy volunteering and similiar things. It's a lovely thing to do for others."

I worked in a DD (developmentally disabled) house for swing. Had a few hours to myself every shift after the clients went to sleep or were watching TV in their rooms. Worst part about the job, the coworkers. They'd stab you in the back just to get a .25 cent raise.  Bunch of people barely getting paid minimum wage snitching on each other to look good for management. 

For abuse, I'm all for mandatory reporting and going straight to management after I put the phone down to the state. However, the things they tattled on people about were honestly just confusing. I learned fast to keep my mouth shut and make sure I note everything I did in the log and attribute it to myself if I did it. I let my coworkers make their own log notes and do their own paperwork. I kept mine up to date and used neat handwriting.

For all that, I was still down in the boss's office once a month over someone crying about some weak broke ass shit. All to get that .25 cent raise... which they never got because from the looks of the logs, which the boss's relied upon, it looked a lot like yers truly was doing most of the work on swing shift.

lmao.

don't worry tho, last laugh was on me, I didn't get the raise either. Longest 9 months of my life, sooo very glad I moved on from that job."

Keep my mouth shut about politics. I don't talk about politics with my chinese friends, ever. Not even American politics with my Chinese friends. It always leads back to China and I figure as I'm a guest in this country, it pays to sometimes keep my opinions to myself. 

With any sort of physical confrontation, I walk, keep walking, and don't stop walking.

Has only been a problem once or twice for me here in China, few other places as well. Had someone trying to push me around, they were probably drunk. I walked.. kept walking, and didn't stop.

sure my vpn gets blocked sometimes.. but.. I can live without it for a few days.
