Someone else on Ravelry asked for help on the forum for the same problem I’m having but unfortunately I didn’t even understand the answer that was given! Probably due to my limited experience in knitting.

I’ve gotten nearly to the end of the pattern, to the section labeled “ties.” I would really appreciate if some could help me understand what I am meant to do. [FYI: 11 stitches were placed on hold where the nape of the baby’s neck would be in the bonnet.]
