Does no one know what “homophobia” means? It’s thrown around as casually as “racist” and “sexist”. Just because people are uncomfortable with something doesn’t make them prejudice. Get tf out.

There are a lot of things that cause social harm that the government ignores. It just gets fixated on specific things and blames everything bad on it until they can’t dig up any more parallels between bad things and whatever “righteous battle” they’re fighting. And then they find another block of rights to take away from their citizens because “it’s not good for them”. Yes their are harms. But everything has consequences. If people choose to force the consequences of their own choices on other people, then (and only then) should they be penalized. The whole country doesn’t need a curfew, a weapon ban, a drug ban, an alcohol ban, a vape ban, a free speech ban or anything else. The people who abuse these rights should be punished.

The cartels, fake labs, and other tainted/cut drug sources would lose their businesses because legitimate business owners would work hard to give their customers safe, high-quality product. They would want to keep their customer base while black markets could give less of a fuck if dozens of people die in a different country for some cash.

Edit:
Governments are so quick to point fingers and slap regulations on literally anything not in their control. The U.S. had an outbreak of lung diseases that came from *black market thc cartridges* and somehow managed to convince most of the country that all vapes will do that to you. They also convinced everyone that the reason teens are vaping is because of the flavors. Like adults only like tobacco flavor and fruit flavors attract toddlers. Now I’m forced to vape something nasty because the government caused an uproar to get the citizens on its side. The *same shit happened* when the war on drugs sprung into action in the U.S.. And now look. Weed is being legalized and their is no significant evidence that there’s been an uptick in use or problems related to it.
