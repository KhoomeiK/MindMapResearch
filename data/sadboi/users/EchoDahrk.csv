but, you most definitely get censored as hell when you use the word vpn or proxy on their social media ""weibo, wechat, qq"" .. they usually would block your account and since they can know exactly who you are they'll pay close attention to you when you open a new account... it could definitely get worse, but personally, never seen such a thing cuz Chinese ppl that do use a vpn know better than to reveal themselves...

for me as a foreigner, using the word VPN in social media would make them pay more attention to me.. but as long as i don't promote it they leave me alone, but if you do, you'd get in a lot more trouble then a Chinese person... they've taken down WeChat pay for many forigen users a year ago because of such thing.. they even ask for your passport and a photo as evidence to turn it back on as a way to keep tabs on you...

in fact, there's a story of a guy that got imprisoned cuz they thought he's a terrorist because he wanted to know what ""isis"" meant in Chinese ... the guy translated it on ""Baidu translation"" to use it in a meme ... now if he translated it on google translation with a VPN .. none of this would have happened"
