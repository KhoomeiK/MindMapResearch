Also are you on any meds ? Propanalol/amyltriptyline all good preventatives and triptans cut the migraine suffering to a few hours.

Other thing is stress , dump your bf if he isn‚Äôt  on therapy and meds.

For nausea I find plain food only and peppermint oil/ tiger balm on my temples helps. Drink small sips of icy water/ ginger tea  and try to avoid strong lights and smells and public transport if possible. Don‚Äôt eat anything greasy or spicy despite your cravings.

therapy,f8f8otu,t3_e0k14s,1574539933.0,"Yeah perfectionism usually stems from it being very unsafe to upset anyone when you were young. Most likely , trauma first , perfectionism is manifesting as coping mechanism. Like ...make mistake....get the shit kicked out of you, get yelled at , get humiliated. It‚Äôs what happened to me and almost every other perfectionist I know. There‚Äôs that feeling that if only I just do sth well enough , I‚Äôll be safe from harm, safe from my own bad feelings , safe from negativity, and if I‚Äôm not I can blame myself. But in reality it‚Äôs not productive and can be a guide for self sabotage/ procrastination. Perfectionism means that you always fall short and that you always have an excuse to maintain the status quo of very deep self loathing at all times. That if it‚Äôs all your fault : you don‚Äôt have to acknowledge the abuse you experienced.Therapy will help untangle why you feel that way and support the idea that it‚Äôs ok to be human and average and you will still get what you want by not being perfectionistic.
