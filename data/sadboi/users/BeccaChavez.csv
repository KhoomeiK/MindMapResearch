IDAP,fl97k66,t1_fl8y01v,1584943814.0,"I took a class on watercolors at uni so I'm not completely self taught, there are plenty of videos on YouTube and skillshare though. One thing I found out that really helps to make the painting stand out is to go over some parts with colored pencils to add more depth and details, because with watercolors alone I always struggle to get the values and the details right.

Another really important thing is the paper you use, I used Bee cotton paper and I'm not sure I like it? Canson Montval is a great affordable option and if you can afford it definitely use arches, though I never personally used it. In my country the options are pretty limited so there might be better options out there.

I'm mainly a digital artist but I hope this helped a bit? If you have any questions feel free to ask!"

You can also improve your line quality and art fundamentals overall. It's pretty late here so I'm too lazy right now to look for resources but I'm sure you can find a lot if you look these things up on YouTube. I can also find some resources for you tomorrow if you want.

The plants look a bit chunky, an artist who does them beautifully flowy is loish, I'm thinking of a specific piece that's really colorful and full of plants. Make sure to also study from real plants.

Overall I like the piece and I love the idea, it's just missing fundamentals  which is something people don't talk about often enough.

I don't live in the US and can save up to $140 a month, and the base model iPad pro + pencil cost $1380 here, whereas the iPad 7 is $675 and the air $925.

Is the iPad pro worth a whole year of savings? I want something that will last and that I won't quickly feel the need to upgrade, I really don't want the 7 because of the non-laminated screen. I'm afraid of saving up so much for the air and want a pro later on and have to save all that money again, but do I really need a pro?

Considering my budget and that it will be my main tool for art, which one would you guys recommend? By the time I buy it there will probably be some new model but I'd like to know what's best to aim for."

Edit: new bio says (rough translation) crazy cat lady, leftist and virgo. (Not that it matters but astrology signs are kind of popular in my country)  Looking for someone to have some drinks and listen to the same playlists over and over again.

I still don't really like it.

Haven't had trouble getting matches but I've been getting mostly one night stands and I'm getting kind of tired, I'm not looking for something serious either but I'd like to get to know someone better and actually go on dates, I guess? When is a good time to ask if there will be a second date?

They showed movies to people in a foreign language they had no prior knowledge of, when watching with subtitles in their native language they learned 0% of the words, without any subtitles they learned about 7% and with subtitles in the foreign language they learned about 17%.
