Pros: I can actually fit into bathing suits, sun dresses, only have to wear one sport bra, can wear bralettes or go without a bra all together, breasts are perkier and have a better shape, no more crazy levels of boob sweat, less neck and back pain

Cons: i miss my cleavage- I wish my problem would have been my boobs were too small and I could have had implants instead, light scarring makes it hard to wear certain cuts of bathing suits/tops

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons and the cons are more my own insecurities than cons"

Just kept them separate for the first few weeks with the kitten set up in the bathroom and it’s food bowl on the opposite side of the door of my male cat’s food. I’d let the older cat go in and explore the kitten’s space while the baby cat explored the rest of the apartment. This lasted for about six weeks. Eventually, I was sitting on the couch one day and the baby cat was curled up next to the older cat grooming his head."

Or highlighted issues with conservative preservation of “white supremacy”

I do appreciate your perspective though. However I’ve found that “liberal” perspectives have challenged traditional ways of thinking and encouraged free thought. And I say this having been a conservative most my life and having recently transitioned to a more liberal way of thinking
