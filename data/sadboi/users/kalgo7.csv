Jock Doe was theorized to be at oldest 22-24. Dentist at the time said that he believes due to his teeth that he was about 27 though.

Rebecca Jean Dunn - http://www.missingin.org/reg4256/rebecca_jean_dunn.htm

I could be wrong, actually the likelyhood I am wrong is nearly 100%. The funny thing about composites is that everyone has a different interpretation when rebuilding a face.

My guess is that her account was linked to his in some way as he set it up. If they share a savings account which is common for parents and children to share.

It kind of just brings her full circle, she is now the person in love with two people and she now understands that it's possible. She actively avoided being the other woman for 20 years after that but still found herself in love with someone who was dating/engaged/married to another - but she actively avoided it because of guilt. 

Then she became the person in love with two people at once and she understood for the first time that you can be a good person doing mot so good things because you're in love with two people at once. It's not so far of a stretch. It's not a justification for lies and cheating.. but it explains a lot because we have seen Teddy seems like this holier than thou preacher on the sanctity of romance when it comes to Owen's life.

greysanatomy,fluugwu,t3_fr9pys,1585510286.0,"People are multifaceted, just like how t.v characters are meant to be. He's imperfect and not everything is just good or just bad. 

Basically, Karev has a huge heart. You see him take care of many mentally unstable women, you see flashbacks of him taking care of his mom. He was a person with 100 walls up to protect himself but when someone came along who he felt needed protection then he was full speed ahead. Its probably why they molded him into a pediatric surgeon, he works to help the defenseless. Sure, a lot comes back to his childhood but not all of it is bad?

He also attacked Deluca because he thought and it looked like Deluca was going to or had started to force himself on Jo. Once he knew that was not the case he felt immense shame, even before that he realized his actions nearly killed a person. Deluca also made amends with Karev because they are both considerably very passionate people (characters.) 

The reason the ending is annoying is because Alex loves hard, he kept being with Izzy who chose Denny, then George, then dead Denny then dead George over him. It's not even leaving Jo... which is not his style. It's that he went back to a woman who caused him so much pain and suffering. 

We all kind of have things that make us who we are, our childhoods make us who we become and what we do with that in life is truly up to us. I don't think its farfetched for everything to come down to how you were raised, almost everyone I know is driven in one way or another because of the life they had as a child. It's not bad. It's not always that you blame your family.. it's just knowing who you were and who you are. 

Alex fans like Alex because even though he fucks up, he came from nothing and he made it to the top and became a successful and likeable person when from episode 1 it seemed like he was always going to be this douchey catalyst to keep the show interesting... but after 16 seasons he just isn't anymore.

My skin went from oily to dry in the recent years (last 3) and the way this one is formulated is pretty amazing.

I honestly use this oil to also dermaplane my face 1-2x a week and I recently used it to shave my legs when I ran out of my shaving oil (super dry legs) and it was the best thing ever. 

I've tried a few cleansing oils but I keep coming back to this one. And it's like 8 dollars and lasts 3 months usually if you're just using it for regular double cleansing."
SkincareAddiction,fjas770,t3_fchvsn,1583179578.0,"Night routine: 

-Palmers cleansing oil 30 seconds or more (best cleansing oil imo regarding price and effectiveness. For $8, you can't go wrong unless you react to an ingredient. Has a strong rosehip/rose fragrance. Only noticeable once starting to emulsify)

-Cerave hydrating cleanser [fragrance free cream cleanser with niacinimide, I personally am sensitive to niacinimide but a lot of people take zero issue with it and love this cleanser] or Neutrogena Hydroboost Exfoliating cleanser for 30 seconds or more [common neutrogena perfumes fragrance and a lot of people report sensitivity to this product, my skin handles it well but I am gentle with the product. Do not recommend more than 30 second usage]

- 2-3x per week use Clinigue exfoliator on chin area only [I have a deviated septum, not a huge deal but my nose gets blocked easily and I have to breath through my mouth at night, drool on my chin and I have an unfair amount of blackheads on my chin. This products helping reduce the heads that are slowly purging, this one isn't special but it is a microdermabrasion type of exfoliation. NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THOUGH, and I wont purchase it. I got a free gift set with the purchase of the clinique moisture surge .. so I've been using it because of that. ]

- while face is damp apply T.O 0.2% Retinol in squalane [my favorite product that I will never not repurchase. It was like $5 for the bottle. It's a retinol oil and has helped with my pores, huge blackheads, papules, restoring glow to my skin and staving off the redness left from rosacea and insanely cold climate. ]

Occasional nighttime routine add:

- once a week use De La Cruz Sulfur mask (wash off) to help prevent breakouts (also use as spot treatment to prevent the urge to pop pimples) [I bought this a while ago before I tried my retinol and it works well, sulfur calms redness, dries our pimples, gently exfoliates skin and is very good for sensitive skin and rosacea prone people. I probably wont repurchase but will always recommend before diving into using a retinol or a chemical exfoliator because it does work and it's more gentle]

- wash off with Fresh Soy face cleanser (light scent to remove sulfur smell) [I bought this cleanser when my skin was having an allergic reaction to an SA cream. Its soothing and helped my skin in the long run. It's a take or leave it product for me though. I use it to wash off the sulfur ointment because the light cucumber scent in it is soothing and destroys the rotten eggs smell. I likely wont repurchase this product unless something changes. I take no issue with it though and will use it up] 

Day: 
-Wash face with water and Norwex baclock colloidal silver cloth. [Helps soothe, remove oil, dirt and pollutant buildup and prevent breakouts. My mom gave me these clotha for christmas and I have been using them for 3 months. They help pretty drastically with reducing redness, apparently silver is also antimicrobial so you can reuse the cloths a few times as long as they are rinsed with hot water and rung out, hung to dry. I don't use them more than 3 times before washing in the laundry. They are really nice on the skin though. ]

- Clinique moisture surge (This product is expensive and it works. It has started to repair my moisture barrier and I no longer have tight skin. 

- T.O hemi squalane and T.O ""b"" oil (3 drops each) pat into skin [I love squalane and I bought the b oil on a whim, nothing super special about it. They are both very dry oils so I would only use them if you like that feeling or for day time before sunscreen (which is what I do) the argan oil by TO is more slippery and I would use that at night instead (I probably will repurchase that one if I'm honest)]

Wait 5-10 minutes (apply my lip balm, usually aquaphor ointment) [lip balm isn't an elaborate thing for me. It works or it doesn't. I wont spend a lot on lip balms, I usually only use them at night and when my lips are super dry]

- australian Gold tinted mineral sunscreen. [Super drying sunscreen, my day routine is tailored so I can use this one. I bought it to help combat redness and because it's a mineral sunscreen (allergy to chemical sunscreens) and other than it being drying it's a favorite. Once I'm out of it I might not repurchase though since my day routine is so elaborate just to use this product.)

Extras:
Dermaplane 1-2 times per week with schick razor. (I DO THIS FOR NICER MAKEUP APPLICATION, THATS ALL) 

Not featured because I ran out/lost:
-Aquaphor ointment for lips and super dry spots

-Sephora brand lip exfoliator in kiwi flavor (it's a lip balm but i use it at night and wash off) [you could lick this off, I hate lip scrubs that are mostly sugar because they are messy imo and the balm exfoliators are waxy and taste gross if you grt them in your mouth. I use the exfoliator every other night after I brush my teeth and am going to wash my face so that I can wash it off]

-Laneige sleeping mask in pink grapefruit (use this day and night but I left it at a friends and need to get it sometime this week)"

I started using 0.2% retinol in squalane by the ordinary every other night about a month ago (had to take a week off due to getting a rash from another product) and my redness reduction is incredible. Most papules are gone, only a few left which are greatly improved. I applied it over my moisturizer and recently I started spraying my face with mineral water and then applying the oil on top and it's made a dramatic difference.

ESH in a way. You're not the asshole in this situation. But kids are cruel, they say and so stupid things.

Sometimes I said very cruel things or told them to fuck off or that I wish they never had me etc. My moms quite toxic too, so it was hard as a kid growing up and not having the correct therapy or friends or anything. My closest friends mom is toxic too, I didnt really have anything to admire or crave to have. The thing is we all say and do things when we are younger and don't understand the influence they have. 

You need therapy to work through this, your husband should eventually go too and your step son should join as well at some point to repair your relationship. Realistically, parents SHOULD choose their children and if they have instincts like that they will.

snakediet,fehogy8,t1_fehjp2j,1579120684.0,"Ah, okay. I could try that. I'm not even into flavored water either but I'm sure a little could just take away the salty taste. Thanks!"
CanSkincare,fehoarf,t1_fehlqic,1579120586.0,"Ah, I can look into that one! Thanks!

I'm not just into drug store, but I just don't think most of us need more expensive creams if that makes sense. I'm the same with face oils. Unless its treating something specific, I dont get it. I think my skin was mostly good until I hit my early 20's though and in my teens.. I barely used anything. Water and nivea soft and make up remover for mascara.. the only make up I ever wore. Sometimes my mom had me try her clinique products when I had a break out (would happen 2-3 times a year from 13-17) and if my skin felt really gross I would just use dove soap and moisturize after the shower. My policy was to leave it alone if it isn't broken lol."
snakediet,fehnccm,t1_fehmop6,1579120034.0,"Yeah I dont get that urge either. It's hard to grt the 2.2 which is standard. When I work out, I drink fresh water and st the end I just chug some snake juice. Because during a work out I sip and sipping salt water just throws me off mentally.

My family like never drank water. My parents are actually so uninformed that when I was a kid I would tell them I had a sore throat and it felt like I couldn't swallow and it hurt when I did. I was dehydrated because my parents never pushed water consumption. It was a classmate that told me I was dehydrated when I couldn't get my chapped lips to stop peeling. I was in highschool. Lol. Like we drank Gatorade and juice and soda but they never pushed water. But then I went on a ""health kick"" in highschool and never stopped."

snakediet,fehafs3,t1_feha3zd,1579112508.0,"I guess I could drink regular water throughout the day and if I'm feeling low energy then drink some snake juice?

CanSkincare,fef4fob,t1_fef3wlc,1579047938.0,"I actually have used the marula oil. I use it here and there now. Something about it is too greasy, but that's a marula oil thing, I believe. I just use it when I'm desperate or if I decide to use a jade roller. 

Interesting about the cerave though! I never found that. I have a hard time getting the hydrating lotion to absorb into my skin. I used to use it until this year at night as well and later the marula oil or a squalane i ontop. For my body the lotion is great. I can say that luckily cerave doesnt dry my skin out. It used to work well actually. But now my skin has just dried out so much. I think it's the harsh winter and also my roommate runs a dehumidifier all year round all day
 :/ I had combo skin until recently"
CanSkincare,fef243h,t1_fef1xee,1579046376.0,Oh awesome! I'll look into it. I used the essence before without a big difference but the cream could be better

CanSkincare,feet8zx,t1_feeok79,1579040720.0,"Oh thanks! I have the nivea in the tin and use it every now and then.

CanSkincare,feenj2h,t1_feemvw4,1579037347.0,"Right? Fragrance free doesn't mean irritant free. 

A lot of these ""skin experts"" don't seem to realize that certain chemicals are irritating to a lot of people. Like for me Urea really irritated my skin. I can use it but not one dry skin, it has to be after I've moisturized. Niacinamide is the same. Can't use cerave hydrating cleanser and lotion together because of the concentration of niacinamide. Not bashing cerave but we all have personal limits."
CanSkincare,feeliqj,t1_feel65r,1579036185.0,"Ugh. Everyone loves la Roche posay. Its overpriced for drugstore and it irritates my skin. Even with rosacea not a lot of products cause my skin irritation, more than anything I just struggle with dryness. Every product from their line that I've tried has caused irritation. 

I ordered it on amazon actually. But some people say its carried at London Drugs. I have never seen it there before."
CanSkincare,feek2d8,t1_feeju60,1579035339.0,"Ah, thank you! The sunscreen I'm using is super drying but there aren't many options for zinc sunscreens that work with make up. And I'm allergic to other sunscreen, haha."
CanSkincare,feejp3s,t1_feejg3j,1579035126.0,"Ah thanks! I will try that. 

I used the Squalane oil before and liked it for night but now my skin is more dry, do you find it okay for day time use as well?"
CanSkincare,feejjnx,t1_feej3ft,1579035038.0,Ah I actually sometimes put an occlusive on top. Like aquaphor or vaseline. Oddly enough I still will wake up with dry skin on my problem area (forehead)
SkincareAddiction,feej8eb,t3_eogoq8,1579034858.0,"Dry skin here with a touch of rosacea. I sometimes develop pustules fro. High concentrations of lactic acid and urea. I need a new cream to add to my routine I believe to replace what I'm using. Or something else that's going to add moisture. 

My skin has gotten super dry and I'm not sure what to do. 

Night routine:

-Palmers cleansing oil

- Either nutrogena hydroboost exfoliating cleanser (this cleanser doesn't dry my skin out, it actually has helped despite the lactic acid) or cerave hydrating cleanser 
-Sanoma naturals retinol serum (has also helped with dryness)
- avene mineral water mist
- loreal 1.5% hyaluronic acid
- cerave moisturizing cream (in the tub) normal to dry formula

Morning: 

- rinse with water
- sanoma naturals vitamin c serum
- avene mineral water mist
- loreal 1.5% hyaluronic acid
- cerave moisturizing lotion (or cream depending on how dry I feel) normal to dry formula
- Australian gold tinted mineral sunscreen

Is there a more moisturizing cream for skin other than the cerave? I've heard its practically the best but the dryer spots on my face would say otherwise."
relationship_advice,fcaib7y,t1_fca8pn5,1577569727.0,"Yeah, it does suck. I'm just going to leave him for a bit and decide what I want to say. 

At the end of the day his current plans involve him moving far enough away that I'd have to travel by plane rather than drive a few hours. And it's for him to better himself with another course for his future so it's not like I want to be getting in the way of that. And long distance just really isn't for either of us really"

relationship_advice,fbbwvli,t3_echibk,1576709992.0,"They're very young, so one day they will grow up. But until then.. you know what you do?

Set boundaries. Tell them you're over their negative unsolicited comments and that if they don't have anything nice to say then to not say anything just like their mother should have taught them. 

If they continue, cut your contact off with them. I know it sounds isolating and harsh but bad friends aren't worth your energy and they are going to drain you. Your real friend(s) will apologize and come back, or they will take time to grow, apologize and come back."
relationship_advice,faemdqv,t3_e8nh3c,1576003656.0,"When your family helps you out when you're in a tough spot.. you need to show respect to them, that means if you're upset with them then the people you bitch to should only be close friends who aren't loud mouths. You aren't the Kardashians, you do not make your living off of this crap.. therefore there is zero need for this. 

I personally would show evidence to your BIL and ask him if this is a fantasy for him or if this is all what he really sees and thinks. It could be a big blow up, it could be embarrassing for both of you, and there could be a lot of tears but it's worth it in the end. 

I have family members that expect so much when you provide help. And we have had blow ups because of this. I have set up boundaries and called them out and I have refused to spend time with them when they've upset me. Usually, people get the point. When you stop being a pushover they eventually stop pushing or at least they push a lot less often. A caring person will be more concerned about the health of your relationship rather than their impractical idea of how you can make them happier."

snakediet,f8vs6t9,t3_e24u9x,1574876226.0,"Sodium is always going to be better over sugar. 11 Years ago I saw a nutritionist who told me that salty is better than sugary because if you have a bit too much salt that you can flush it out with water but if you have too much sugar it turns to fat. 

Basically, salt can be okay if its balanced with enough water. Crazy that people still don't understand that."

If Tyler said nothing and didn't confess everything they probably would've thrown him in jail without mental help because of the potential velocity of the offense. The justices system isn't a clear cut to be black and white. You have to factor in jurors and the judge as well. Biases are basically a leading factor as much as law is ."

It wasn't great and it's not something I dwell on. I'm telling you because i want to respect you and i feel like keeping this from you is unhealthy."""

It changed everything and I resent him now and can't stand to talk to him.
