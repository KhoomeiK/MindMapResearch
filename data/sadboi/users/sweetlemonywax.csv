I have lost track of the jabs about my body. ""You're too thin."" ""Why are you always dieting?"" ""You eat like a bird."" ""You're too restrictive."" ""You're so weak."" ""Stop obsessing over staying thin."" ""Live a little."" ""Why don't you eat some cake?"" ""Oh, she's on a diet.""

Invariably, the people who say these things have issues with body image themselves. I have never ever heard this kind of comment from a person who I know to be confident and at peace with themselves. I think the real reason they say things like this is to avoid facing their own issues by projecting them onto someone else."

Anxiety,fkse8dj,t3_fkdbca,1584488100.0,"My guess would be it's the anxiety. I promise it passes! I had 6 MONTHS during a time when I was very anxious and depressed where I could not take a deep breath. Thought I was dying, had my chest x-rayed after being rushed to hospital with a bad panic attack. Was totally fine physically.

That eventually passed and what has helped me most since is the controlled breathing that we do in yoga (pranayama). We'll often do pranayama exercises before going into a yoga routine. So maybe it could help to try before exercise? It really helped me, and now deep controlled breathing kicks in automatically a lot of times when I am feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Not 100% of the time but it's definitely been a huge help over the years.

I think the other big thing is accepting that your breath is going to be short and saying, Okay, this is how it's going to be for a while. I can live with this for a while.

Last thing is doing something zen that tends to calm you. I was panicking and crying due to the global crisis and dashed plans a couple of days ago, and I sat down and started doodling in my sketchbook, and it soothed me so much. Helped clear my head so I could function again.

Good luck, stay safe and well. It will pass!"

I studied film in college, and while I almost always missed the symbolic imagery just like what you're describing as well as verbal innuendos and subtleties, I was able to pick up on formal patterns in editing and mise en scene, repetitive elements recurring from film to film, etc. that nobody else was noticing, because that is my strength - maybe it's yours too! Hitchcock films can be appreciated on so many levels. They are very formally rigorous, painstakingly storyboarded, shot, and edited with ultimate economy (one of the reasons studios loved him - he never wasted any of that precious film stock) - in a way, they are masterpieces of cinematic engineering.

In the worst case, if the teacher is really stuck on you interpreting the film in a specific way, there are many film studies/analysis resources available that spell out the interpretations, and checking those out will help you get a feel for how to notice subtext in the future. Another way to get better is to watch some of his other films, including the silent ones which tend to be shorter and have to rely on more powerful and obvious imagery, and pay attention to the similarities between films.

I was going through a rough patch a couple of years ago with my boyfriend because of issues similar to what you're describing. At the time I was also listening to this self-help podcast called Awaken Radio. In the episode I'm linking, the host guides you through questions to ask yourself and write down the answers to when you feel you've been let down in a relationship and are having trouble communicating it. I  wrote down the questions and answers on index cards and used them to help stand my ground when I confronted my boyfriend about the issue we were having. I would have broken up with him then if I hadn't been able to sort this out, just because I couldn't communicate, and was feeling gaslighted, cornered, bewildered, hopeless. After having that episode as a guide, it's been a lot easier for me to communicate, and our relationship has improved a lot. Improving your social skills in life can start with one person. The podcast is pretty woo-woo at times, but overall it's been incredibly helpful, not just for relationships but for personal growth as well.

Then - this is really random - I play rummikub for a few minutes, say good night to my boyfriend, and close my eyes. I used to read novels, but would often get over-excited by the story and not be able to sleep, so now I do my reading in the morning."

aspergirls,es80cv3,t3_c6c6vb,1561684809.0,"I have been on both sides of this situation. I can freeze up too and feel so awkward. I think just being there, being physically present matters as much as or more than actively comforting or crying with them. Recently I had to go to a funeral following an extremely tragic death. The family expressed so much gratitude just for my showing up. I didn't have to say anything except I'm so sorry for your loss, may he rest in peace. There were so many people present, and I think people (more so NTs) instinctively get some powerful vibes of love and support just from people physically being there."

TrueFilm,eqriq5m,t3_bzbf95,1560261998.0,"The best thing I can recommend is to compare, compare, compare. Take Legally Blonde - compare it to Cleo de 5 a 7. Both films are about successful working women, both have a love interest, both have a platonic female friend, both have a strong tie to the setting, etc. Find the similarities, then look at the differences - totally different story, different time and place in history, what were the cultural views about women and about life in general, what does one film care about that the other doesn't even touch on, etc etc, and you can start noticing how these aspects come out in the construction of the film. Then take Cleo de 5 a 7 - watch something else by Varda and compare - what is different, what repeats? What is the vision of the director and what is the vision of the times? Then take a film from a contemporary of Varda - A Bout de souffle by Godard, for example - compare again. If you keep doing this, you will start to notice patterns. You'll notice influences, biases, breakthroughs, and you'll be able to develop your own informed take on the films you see. There isn't one way to do it. Zizek, Deleuze, Bordwell, Ebert - very disparate points of view, but all valid, and they all make you think! Film interpretation is its own art form. It takes practice, but is rewarding!"
