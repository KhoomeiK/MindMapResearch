fatlogic,fphal3o,t3_gdenfr,1588617867.0,"I hate the whole “it’s okay” thing. Like yes, it’s OKAY and you don’t have to feel bad about yourself; you’re not defined by your weight. But is it healthy to be obese and reliant on food as a coping mechanism? No"
fatlogic,fp3a7wz,t1_fp2hi15,1588275787.0,Yes exactly! That’s what I don’t understand.
fatlogic,fp1w3o0,t3_gan69l,1588249435.0,Perhaps stop relying so much on food to make you happy?
fatlogic,fp0qcgn,t1_fp0nc9a,1588214601.0,"They actually write “o*ese” sometimes because they just can’t bear the term. 

They actually prefer “fat” or “fatty” which IMO sounds way more hurtful, as it’s often used with bullying."
fatlogic,fp0prwm,t3_gan69l,1588214251.0,What are the social determinants of health?
Anxiety,foz5kjn,t3_gaarcc,1588185055.0,It’s exhausting. I’m working from home and had to take a nap on my lunch break because I had such an anxious morning.
fatlogic,fouk4q5,t3_g9m5hi,1588085539.0,"If weight gain is so harmless why not post memes about it? And where did she get that people said it would be “the worst possible outcome”? Like, no one even said that? So many assumptions."
fatlogic,fouj1f3,t3_g9m5hi,1588084972.0,"“It’s interesting to see that even in a pandemic, what a lot of folks are most afraid of is looking like me.”

I’m sorry, but not everything is about you. People use self-deprecating humor all the time as a coping mechanism. Other people have poor self-esteem/body image too. They’re not thinking about you at all when they make (possibly insensitive) comments, so why are you taking it so personally/as an attack on you?"
fatlogic,formi7q,t1_foq9v31,1588014736.0,"Because there’s no possible way to overeat or abuse food. Did you know you need 3,000 calories per day just to lay in bed?    /s"
fatlogic,forcpxc,t3_g8kxu7,1588010006.0,Why doesn’t she suggest making dietary changes? That doesn’t have to be weight-focused. She’s basically telling this poor person there’s literally nothing she can do to change the outcome.
intrusivethoughts,fnwihf8,t1_fnwfusb,1587319007.0,Thank you I really appreciate the encouragement :)

This is an intrusive thought I’m having. I have severe health anxiety and OCD. But thanks for the kind words."
intrusivethoughts,fnw20pg,t1_fnvxcp7,1587309818.0,Thanks. I have severe health anxiety.
Anxiety,fnaj2t4,t3_g0jf5y,1586798377.0,"I wish I had something to offer you that helps, but I feel same way very often. It feels like it will never go away, unless numbed with medication, which leads to not feeling anything at all. 

The thing that has given me the most relief lately has been exercise, running/jogging particularly. I’m not good at it, but I’ll run for a little and then walk for a little. The mood boost from endorphins afterwards quiets my anxiety a little. It’ll always be there, but it helps me feel better for just a little while. 

Remember, you are not the voice of the mind, you are the one who hears it."
