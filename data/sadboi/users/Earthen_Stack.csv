Solidarity, sibling. Stay strong <3"
BPD,fn9f596,t3_g0a4ky,1586770578.0,"Yeah, I identify with this a whoooooooooole bunch. I'm so empty inside and I'm terrified of people finding out that I'm nothing but a nightmare person, so I try my very best to placate them. Sure, this is because of my solidly fucked up childhood--all of it, the fawning, the BPD, and all the rest of the horse shit in my life, but that doesn't really matter. 

People crave authenticity and I am a fake person."
BPD,fn9esr4,t3_g0apur,1586770191.0,"I do it when I'm dissociating, or I do it when they message me while I'm doing something else, or the ADHD hits and I'm back to trying to do 4 or 5 things at the same time (or laser focusing on one). But even if one is not in the throes of a mental health garbage fire, things pop up. People forget. And if they're fucking with me then...well I don't know. I guess that just sucks for me."

I had a fun time last night when I got hit with all the memories of the shitty things that I've done to people I care about within the last like 6 months that almost sent me into another meltdown."

CPTSD,fft27yz,t3_eutsne,1580203121.0,"Hi. I am sort of in the same boat, or at least in the same lake as you are. I can't recall anything about my childhood other than a few scattered memories. What I do remember highlights a pretty solid pattern of neglect from my mother and my father. My life basically began when I was in 8th grade and 13 years old. Every time I try to think about what the hell went on then I just get a nice black void. 

I've got a bite mark (I think???) scar on my body and have no idea where it came from, and a thin scar down my wrist that I can't explain at all. My parents were divorced when I was 3ish, and I found out recently that at around 6 or 7 I lived with my dad for an entire year because my mom had some sort of breakdown.

The way I managed to get through it was to become a social chameleon. I can put on various masks and get into random things and ingratiate myself anywhere, but along the way I've lost the real me I was trying to hide, and now I just plain don't even know what I enjoy or what I am even like.

I wish I had some method or tool to use to help remember. I hate not having access to my own life. I too have a vibrant and thriving sense of self-hatred. And I wish I had some better words to help you as well, but...solidarity, friend.

Oh! Someone was kind enough to point out that it may be beneficial to start at the opposite end when finding what I like: begin figuring out what I definitely don't like, and go from there. Haven't been able to do it yet, but it sounded good!"
CPTSD,ffr4c9z,t3_ets2vh,1580150178.0,"This is pretty upsetting, I experience a lot of different symptoms of anxiety but never feel ""anxious"" and never have any panic attacks. I do this alllllll the time. I'm starting now to ruminate and worry if I actually have terrible anxiety and I'm so messed up that I can't even recognize it. Oof."
CPTSD,ffcot45,t1_ffb99vv,1579804020.0,I would perhaps not issue commands to people tho. I know that sort of shit messes me up big time. :(
CPTSD,ffamt0p,t3_esgn8e,1579739629.0,All the time and every day. I wish I knew how to stop it.
CPTSD,ffad86s,t1_ffa7oj7,1579732798.0,"I get what you're saying, but I'm so early in my recovery I really can't say what is what. I just know that if I tell people how I feel day-to-day they retreat from me with the quickness. So, I just keep the indifferent mask on and plow forward like everything is fine, when it so clearly is not. :("
CPTSD,ffa1fom,t3_esb90j,1579725956.0,"You absolutely matter, and the way you feel is totally valid. Up until extremely recently I was in the ""oh it's not so bad"" category, when it actually was--as evidenced by my lifelong pattern of avoidance, risky behavior, addiction, and chronic inability to form lasting relationships. I don't have any sort of event that I can remember that put me in this situation, so I constantly feel like an imposter too.

So, you're not alone. What happened to you was real. What happened to you has impacted you greatly, and there's nothing made up or ""not good enough"" about any of that."
CPTSD,ffa0yar,t1_ff9n870,1579725674.0,"It might be beneficial to disregard what their parents say if they're their abusers, too."
CPTSD,ff9zgq1,t3_esckyk,1579724803.0,"Oh yeah, absolutely. The way I try to describe it to my therapist is that I have a river of self hate that I get dunked into a la Winston did in Ghostbusters 2. It's always there, and always mad, and always completely brutal and unrelenting towards myself. Everything that goes wrong in my life, says this river, is 100% my fault. And every action I take is more ammunition for it to keep up the assault. It never ends, and is so very fucking exhausting. I turned to drugs and alcohol to shut it up, which was a real cool move because it just added another layer of bullshit I have to deal with now in addition to whatever the fuck happened to me. :( Solidarity, friend."
CPTSD,ff9ycnx,t1_ff91n35,1579724151.0,"Yeah, I'm very empathetic (almost to a fault), and I think I love getting myself out there and being seen. I've never had any sort of shame (probably due to having 0 fuckin boundaries), so I would often act goofy in public to get laughs. I also like to perform--as in be on stage, public speaking, the like. I wonder how much of that is actually me now...

I already figured I was gonna be in therapy for the rest of my life, this just kinda cements it for me."
CPTSD,ff902l1,t3_es4lge,1579701383.0,"I've never thought about this, which is a really upsetting thing in and of itself--that I haven't thought about SO MUCH of my life and what's wrong--but now that I have...yeah. I've never really felt any strong pull to the houses and apartments I grew up in. I almost always feel like a ghost who is just passing through, stopping occasionally to haunt a place."
CPTSD,ff8p580,t1_ff8nrul,1579689915.0,"That's a really good idea, thank you! I didn't think of doing something like that. Guess I've got more work to do!!!!"
CPTSD,ff8nv76,t1_ff8i0fh,1579687995.0,"It goes even weirder for me. I listen to all my friends' problems, and am there for them when the going gets real rough for them. I've seen them mask off and yet I can't ever do the same. Sometimes I let people see behind the curtain to how rotten and depressed and miserable I am, but that seems to startle them more than anything else soooooooooooo mask goes right back on. 

I used to say several mantras a day trying to...fuck I don't even know why, but one of which was ""you are alone, nobody cares about you"" which helped keep my mask on at all times no matter what.

Who would have thought that substance abuse and addiction would be, like, the least of my worries?"
CPTSD,ff7a9bu,t3_epgxne,1579644458.0,"I realized that while my father was most likely my active abuser, my mother also did me a disservice by being completely physically and emotionally unavailable due to her own disability + emotional trauma from being with my father (they divorced when I was 2 or 3). 

It's extraordinarily vexing for me, however, to not be able to remember my own life. The out of order sensations and memory fragments of a few seconds at a time are infuriating, and the more I try to remember the more solid the emptiness becomes. I don't know what to do, my therapist tells me to go slow, but it's like I'm not going at all. Am I going to have to come to terms with the possibility that I'll never know why I'm so fucked up?"
CPTSD,ff78w0b,t3_erwyxy,1579643432.0,Well...fuck.
CPTSD,f8bv0se,t3_dzozzq,1574445963.0,"I don't know. I can't remember most of my childhood, but I have some pretty solid memories: my first sexual experience with someone my own age in third grade, and also showering with my father until I was 10 or 11. This was before the internet, so I don't know how I knew what to do with my friend. After that I was pretty high-key sexual with zero boundaries, ended up going down the anonymous sex route for a fair number of years and started smoking meth, but luckily I pulled out of that spiral when the alcoholism really took over.

But...since I can't remember anything about my childhood really, I have no idea if I'm just making it up or what. I've never felt safe around people, and tend to never open up to anyone. I just don't know why I'm like this, and I'm kind of afraid to continue."

I'll realize I'm hungry, resolve to eat something, then steadfastly do nothing about it until I'm light headed/shaking/irritable--all while doing something else like watching youtube or playing a game or whatever. My attention span is fucked too, I've been on ADHD meds to try and help but it's not so great there either. I've got a ton of energy and then before I know it it's not 9:00AM anymore, it's like 6:30PM."
CPTSD,f78luaa,t1_f77xk4i,1573495081.0,"I made this account today after going to cptsd memes. Up until the year of our lady 2019 I thought I was just messed up a little bit like I guess normal people are, but so many things I'm reading are making me go ""Oh! Ohh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" 

I'm 6'2, 220, and I always sneak up on people even though I don't try. :D

edit: im not self daignosing, therapist suggested I look up cptsd and my idiot brain goes ""find the fucking MEMES"""
