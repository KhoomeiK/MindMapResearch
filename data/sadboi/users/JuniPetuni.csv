EmotionalSupportDogs,fpsi794,t1_fpshv60,1588873896.0,Just now looking at that thread and it's absolutely disgusting.. I can't believe some people can be so rude. ESA handlers should not have to go through this and treated like this.

Anxiety,fnlo43o,t3_g2dcew,1587056830.0,I can relate! Storms have always given me anxiety but over the years it's gotten worse. I can't even sleep if I know there will be a storm that night. I am especially anxious during thunderstorms ever since I learned that they can sometimes lead to tornadoes. Snowstorms really aren't a problem for me though and generally I find small snowstorms quite soothing.

And ""I have been experiencing these symptoms, should I get it checked with my doctor?"". Also POTs is not a very well known condition and I've heard its often takes a while to get diagnosed.

It is not advised to get an ESA letter through an online service because usually the mental health professional doesn't know you at all and so usually they just write letters to anyone even if they don't have a reason to have an ESA (not saying you don't have a valid reason to have one!).

aww,eyf6gz9,t1_eyf63yb,1567044134.0,If non-service dogs are in places that are NOT pet friendly that is MOST definitely against Federal laws. The ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) is a federal law meaning it applies to all 50 states. Some cities are super dog friendly and have a lot of pet friendly places and that's great but pets are not allowed in service animal only places. If you'd like more info you can check out ada.gov :)
aww,eyf5vss,t1_eyf5ns8,1567043890.0,Oh I actually didn't know that. Although they would still be allowed to ask I believe since federal law allows them to so even if store policy doesn't they still can but correct me if I'm wrong because I'm really not sure. I'd actually really like to know. 🤔
aww,eyf59t3,t1_eyf49dn,1567043632.0,"Employees are allowed to ask 2 questions per the ADA, ""Is that animal a service animal required because of a disability"" and ""What tasks has the dog been trained to perform"". A lot of people forget they can ask the second one. Many people who bring their pets in won't be able to answer the second question and if they reply Emotional Support then the employee can ask them to leave because ESAs do not have public Access rights. A lot of people also forget that if a service animal is being disruptive (i.e eliminating inside the building, barking, lunging, etc.) Then they can legally ask them to leave, whether it's a real service dog or not. Completely see your point though and honestly I completely understand why most employees don't say anything because they don't want to loose their job."

aww,eyf39jv,t1_eyf2wub,1567042784.0,It's true. Your dog is cute and all but Target is a service animal only store for all of their stores. Also it's against health code to have an animal in a shopping cart even if it's a service animal.

Anxiety,ew5wdhv,t3_cmw4sw,1565146817.0,"Terrible. I was sick and was going to a walk in clinic. I had anxiety while I was on the way there itself. This anxiety caused me to experience loss of feeling in my lower legs. Me not knowing this was a symptom of my anxiety started freaking out. By the time I got there I felt so weak I could barely walk and had to hold onto my mom to get to the door. My anxiety continued to get worse and I started to hyperventilate and my heart was pounding. This made me feel light-headed and it scared me even more because I thought it was a symptom of being sick. I was also shaking like crazy. I wasn't thinking straight. I was crying and asking them to take me back as quickly as they could. I was convinced that I was dying in the moment and that I needed an oxygen tank. It was terrible, absolutely terrible. Anyway they take me back and tell me that the reason I was feeling light-headed was because of me hyperventilating. I was a bit relieved but it still took me a while to calm down from that. Well anyway there's my story of my first anxiety attack. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I also tend to get super disassociative when my anxiety is really high or I'm having an attack, though that didn't happen the first time I had an attack."

If that is the case I would urge OP to do more research on tasks and what a Service Dog could do for them but I don't know if that's the case.

dogs,ev8pazz,t1_ev88uc8,1564286747.0,"There are No certifications for ESAs and as the pinned comment says, ESAs and Service Dogs are not the same thing. Service dogs go through extensive training and must perform at least one task pertaining to their handlers disability. ESAs require no special training and don't perform tasks as ""comfort"" is not a task under the ADA. In order to have an ESA you need a letter from your therapist/psychiatrist stating that you need this animal to help your mental disabilities.

dogs,ev8p3i4,t1_ev8m54b,1564286545.0,"In order to be a Service Dog under the ADA (essentially legally) the dog must perform t least one task that pertains to their handler disability. While some shelter dogs can make great service dogs their washout rate is much higher. I am not saying not to get a shelter dog, you just have to know what could happen. Also they are training it to do things. These dogs go through **extensive** training and need to be able to work in basically any environment, which means working around loud noises, crowded spaces, etc. And yeah by what OP posted it does sound like they need it to do tasks to mitigate their disability so yes they do need it to do something."
