Anxiety,fnlo43o,t3_g2dcew,1587056830.0,I can relate! Storms have always given me anxiety but over the years it's gotten worse. I can't even sleep if I know there will be a storm that night. I am especially anxious during thunderstorms ever since I learned that they can sometimes lead to tornadoes. Snowstorms really aren't a problem for me though and generally I find small snowstorms quite soothing.

aww,eyf6gz9,t1_eyf63yb,1567044134.0,If non-service dogs are in places that are NOT pet friendly that is MOST definitely against Federal laws. The ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) is a federal law meaning it applies to all 50 states. Some cities are super dog friendly and have a lot of pet friendly places and that's great but pets are not allowed in service animal only places. If you'd like more info you can check out ada.gov :)
aww,eyf5vss,t1_eyf5ns8,1567043890.0,Oh I actually didn't know that. Although they would still be allowed to ask I believe since federal law allows them to so even if store policy doesn't they still can but correct me if I'm wrong because I'm really not sure. I'd actually really like to know. ü§î

A lot of people forget they can ask the second one. Many people who bring their pets in won't be able to answer the second question and if they reply Emotional Support then the employee can ask them to leave because ESAs do not have public Access rights. A lot of people also forget that if a service animal is being disruptive (i.e eliminating inside the building, barking, lunging, etc.) Then they can legally ask them to leave, whether it's a real service dog or not. Completely see your point though and honestly I completely understand why most employees don't say anything because they don't want to loose their job."

Anxiety,ew5wdhv,t3_cmw4sw,1565146817.0,"Terrible. I was sick and was going to a walk in clinic. I had anxiety while I was on the way there itself. This anxiety caused me to experience loss of feeling in my lower legs. Me not knowing this was a symptom of my anxiety started freaking out. By the time I got there I felt so weak I could barely walk and had to hold onto my mom to get to the door. My anxiety continued to get worse and I started to hyperventilate and my heart was pounding. This made me feel light-headed and it scared me even more because I thought it was a symptom of being sick. I was also shaking like crazy. I wasn't thinking straight. I was crying and asking them to take me back as quickly as they could. I was convinced that I was dying in the moment and that I needed an oxygen tank. It was terrible, absolutely terrible. Anyway they take me back and tell me that the reason I was feeling light-headed was because of me hyperventilating. I was a bit relieved but it still took me a while to calm down from that. Well anyway there's my story of my first anxiety attack. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I also tend to get super disassociative when my anxiety is really high or I'm having an attack, though that didn't happen the first time I had an attack."

Also they are training it to do things.
