socialskills,fo0id6b,t1_fo0i1wy,1587413676.0,Thank you. I always felt like I had to perform a certain so socialising kind of became draining for me. I guess I was trying too hard to be something I’m not. I always feel so uncomfortable in social situations but I’ll start working towards being more relaxed and comfortable in myself. Thank you for the reply❤️❤️❤️
socialskills,fo09pdz,t1_fnzylon,1587408568.0,Thank youuu❤️
socialskills,fo09kfl,t1_fo01rus,1587408496.0,I don’t think so?
mentalhealth,fo09hfq,t1_fo02891,1587408451.0,It feels like everyone already has their circle and when I try to join in it feels like I’m intruding. Not even feeling u can see the look on their faces. I’m not trying to be pessimistic but this is rly how it’s been for me and so I find myself uncomfortable in social situations u know. I don’t rly know what it’s like to have a best friend

mentalhealth,fbge7hh,t3_ed8qne,1576846588.0,Don’t kill urself. Talk with ur parents and spark dialogue about what you’ve been feeling. It’s hard but u need to get ur feelings out. Killing urself isn’t the option. Your parents love you and want you around so just tell them. Better to apologise than live in silent shame
MaladaptiveDreaming,fbge0bw,t3_ed7mzl,1576846394.0, Dayum that’s a good way of looking at it
MentalHealthSupport,f9tesju,t3_e6uaag,1575620450.0,Maybe speak to your roommates about how you don’t appreciate them ignoring you. You asked for a simple thing to be done it would be very easy to do it even if they were busy.
mentalhealth,f9teav5,t3_e6ljqf,1575619753.0,Awesome!!

MaladaptiveDreaming,f9te768,t1_f9t5a6r,1575619609.0,Same(with a dig anime) but I feel like I can never look at the anime the same way so it just even ruins me simply enjoying the anime cuz I can’t see it the way it’s supposed to be seen.
MaladaptiveDreaming,f9te5ke,t1_f9s2mxu,1575619544.0,Yeah me too
selfimprovement,f9te3u0,t1_f9t5i1o,1575619480.0,In the country I’m in right now there’s a big protest going on and everyone is pulling strikes so I’m mostly at home just like everyone else my age. I usually wake up at around 8-10am stay in bed for abit maybe go on my phone and check insta. I go down stairs for some breakfast then stay downstairs with my siblings and go on my phone. I would draw in my sketchbook and post on insta and I would research ways to deal with the problems I have rn ig. I watch lots of ted talks and also dr Peterson. I would also text some friends (who are far away from me 👀)When my parents come home we eat lunch then after that I’m just on my phone again or maybe play some guitar. Lol I’m guessing I’m on my phone too much. At night time before I sleep I journal in my journaling book but before I usually just brush my teeth and wash my face then go upstairs.

Have u been to therapy? And also do u know anyone that also has that could give me some advice they got from professionals?
Maybe some sites that could be helpful.
Really anything that’s has helped you and you think will help me.
I will appreciate it a lot. Thank you"

MaladaptiveDreaming,f9pyqep,t3_e61uaw,1575551884.0,It started off when I was struggling in school and felt very depressed and lonely so I would watch anime to forget about it all. Usually I would finish the anime and have nothing else to do but I didn’t want to feel the pain so I would elongate the anime in my head and make different scenarios and stories to entertain myself.
