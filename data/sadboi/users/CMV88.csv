It's unbelievably scary to put yourself out there to anyone let alone someone you already care so much about. If she didn't think her presence in your life meant as much as it does to you, she wouldn't have stuck around. By the way you describe her being there for you, I can absolutely tell she loves you and she knows you love her. She probably knows your internal struggle as well. People who truly care about us pick up on all of these things. Stop putting all of this pressure on yourself to find the ""right"" words to express to her. She knows already! If you still can't get the courage to say what you feel like you need to say then write her a heartfelt letter. I have done this from time to time bc of it being practically impossible for me to literally say the words out loud. When I get this sudden urge to make sure the one I love knows how much he means to me I write him a letter. It's so much easier to get everything out. It's also something he keeps to remind him how much I do love him and need him when I'm struggling with my own mind."

family,fns3l28,t1_fnqdvyu,1587211550.0,"Something I've been learning about myself (31F) recently in therapy is that I've been in constant survival mode my whole life. I grew up being sexually abused by a family member for years and I never told my parents bc he had put into my head that they wouldn't care and would be mad at me about it. I also learned that my parents were actually emotionally negligent. So I discovered that I crave positive affirmations and affection from those I love. When I don't always receive it, my fight or flight kicks in bc I subconsciously feel like I'm being emotionally neglected again. My therapist is trying to open my mind up to be able to decipher when the missing affirmations and affection are actual red flags and when they aren't. Also, as a result of everything I've been through, I've taught myself to be ""emotionless"" and to keep my feelings and opinions to myself. I never learned the true feeling of being loved until just recently. 

When you say, ""I like to think she cares about me...but part of me feels like she doesn't"", it made me immediately think of how I try to subconsciously decide if someone really loves me. If you feel at peace with her, she loves you. If you feel safe with her, she loves you. People who don't love you aren't able to make you feel this way. 

You can let her know that you love her as well in ways that aren't as forward or as scary as flat out saying I love you. You can tell her you really appreciate her being there for you. You can tell her you feel calmer or at peace when you're talking with her. Trust me, when you feel like you do when you're with her, it's your mind reassuring you that she does care for you and love you without conditions. 

We all have the ability to truly know who loves us. It's just a matter of trusting ourselves. We know how much damage can be done when someone we love, and should love us back, hurts us. So we're constantly looking for red flags with those we love but only those who truly love us back can make us feel safe, peaceful, loved unconditionally. 

I'm not always the best with explaining things, so I hope what I've said makes sense to you and helps ease your mind."

I'm a SAHM and my husband works a lot. He isn't very helpful with the baby either. I'm leaning towards an abortion. I also have depression that I take medication for and I suffered very badly with PPD. The first 4 months of my son's life I felt like an unfit mother, I was scared I might hurt him, and I had no help from my husband. He's a little better now with helping but I still do probably 90% of raising our son and also with his daughter (13y) that we have full custody of. So I believe it will be best for my mental health and my children's well being for me to terminate. My husband says he supports whatever decision I make but he also doesn't believe I'll go through with an abortion. He says it will eat away at me forever. I know I'm going to have problems mentally from it but I've been weighing my options and so far I feel at peace with what I need to do. No matter what I decide though I know there's going to be a lot of emotions to work through. I'm even going to start looking for a therapist today.

He even has the audacity to get mad at me when I question him about why I always have to be the one doing things with his daughter. Her BM isn't around and he says I need to bond with her. Well guess what, I have a better relationship with her as her stepmom than he has ever had as her real father! But if I say anything about it I'm ""not being a good mother to her"". üò† Ugh I could go on and on right now."
sahm,ex9onqd,t3_crtz89,1566092074.0,"As my 6 mo old son lays in his crib screaming unconsolably (like he's been doing for majority of the day) and my husband just got home from his work day but not before he stopped by his buddies house and has a few beers, I completely understand you. I take care of our son and his daughter (12) every day and he has complete freedom. If I don't agree or aren't happy with what he's deciding to do, he does it anyway and just deals with me being pissed. He goes to work, he goes to his favorite store Menards just to stroll around, he gets to visit his friends- all while not having a baby and sometimes also a crabby preteen with him. I had a stressful purchasing job that I didn't enjoy, so when I got pregnant we weighed the pros and cons of me staying home. Little did I truly know that I'd become no one to myself. I don't know who I am or what I want anymore, and it's only been 6.5 months."
stepparents,ex6xkhg,t3_cr8sz2,1566053034.0,"I had a difficult childhood with an abusive brother and parents with blinders on. I struggled well into my twenties with depression and anxiety. I ruined my fair share of relationships including with my husband before we were married. Luckily I got the help I needed (therapy and antidepressant) to finally get my shit together and patch things up with my then exbf who I married a year and a half ago and had my first bio child with 6 months ago. Now, my SD12 is dealing with her own depression and anxiety. Her BM is now a heroin addict and was drinking and doing drugs all through her pregnancy with my SD. My SD struggles the most with self esteem issues and lack of motherly affection. I feel like I am to blame for some of that. I met her when she was 5. I was 23 and still struggling with my own shit. I just wanted her dad, I didn't wanna be her mom. Her BM was still in the picture then but she was causing hell and was starting to create SD's issues. Her father and I broke up and got back together many times within 4 years time. He has issues of his own too. Everyone has their own shit it's how we choose to move forward. We've chosen to work on ourselves and help our daughter work on herself. We want her to succeed and be happy! In order to do so we also have to succeed and be happy. Kids are so aware of everything going on around them even at a young age when they don't know they're aware. We are our children's future! We are how they succeed and become happy! It doesn't matter who has what or who's done what. It only matters how we move forward with ourselves."
stepparents,ex6sax5,t3_crjgw7,1566050688.0,I love this! My SD12 has been learning to figure skate for 3 years now. We decided to up her club membership so she could go more often during the week. Now she's really excelling. She's learning small hops and backwards skating. I'm proud of her for sticking with it even when she would get down on herself for not being as good as the other girls (even though they've been doing it much longer than she has).
stepparents,ex6o187,t1_ex2f04t,1566048738.0,How do you file for abandonment? That's something we'd be interested in looking into.
stepparents,ex6ne9f,t1_ex2bc3v,1566048460.0,"This!!! I can't wait until my SD12 can really resonate with this! We tell her over and over again that she is enough. We love her, we continue to choose her every day! Bc of her BM drug addictions she wasn't able to choose her but it's not bc of SD it's bc of the addictions. She hears us but I know it's hard for her to truly believe it. It breaks my heart."
depressionregimens,ex6fxfz,t1_ex50i6s,1566045002.0,Thank you! My Dr and I decided I should stay on the Lexapro. She suggested I split the dose to morning and night to hopefully spread it out more. I'm also going to start therapy again. Thanks to everyone for your help and thoughtful words. üôÇ
stepparents,ex6f3ei,t1_ex2kqxo,1566044596.0,"I totally understand what you're saying. I never wanted kids until I was around 27 I started thinking about maybe having one. I met my SD when she was 5. She didn't talk to me the first year I was around. She would only whisper to her dad or his mom when other people were around. Her BM has always been a mess. She has always been horrible to my husband. I thought this is crazy, how can a mother be so awful? Doesn't she see what it's doing to her daughter? Now, my SD is almost 13 and she has terrible self esteem problems, depression, abandonment issues, and affection problems. She's going to therapy and we do our best to reassure her that we are proud of her, love her, and support her. Some days are better than others. 

I also have struggled with depression throughout my life. I had a difficult childhood. I have a toxic mother and my brother was abusive to me in more ways than one. I thought I would never bring a child into this cruel world. Until I decided to. I got pregnant 5 months after our wedding. I worried through the entire pregnancy that I wouldn't love this child, that I wouldn't be able to keep him safe, that he would grow up resenting me like I do my mom and like my SD does to her BM. The very second they put him on my chest, I knew I wouldn't have to worry about any of that bc I would literally do everything in my power to make this child happy and to have a good life.

I can't fully describe how it feels to love him. When I look in his eyes I feel complete. When he puts his hand on me I feel complete. 

Don't get me wrong though, it's incredibly hard to raise a baby! I've never done this before and it's more than overwhelming some days. I struggled with PPD the first three months and I thought I had made a horrible mistake thinking I'd be cut out to be a mother. But I got back on my antidepressant and I am so happy I have him. There's always pros and cons to everything in life but in this instance the pros far outweigh the cons. üôÇ"
depressionregimens,ex1v9it,t1_ex18gos,1565956741.0,"Thanks! Yes, when your SO doesn't understand what you're going through it adds an extra difficulty. My husband also has noticed the difference in my attitude and moods while on the medicine so at least they aren't completely oblivious. üòè 

Therapy was a hard one to start for me too. I had no clue how to talk to a stranger about my life. Luckily, I found an older woman who was more like talking to a loving mother than a stranger. Just remember, you need to feel comfortable with your therapist. Kinda like the medications, sometimes you have to try a few before you get the right one for you."
stepparents,ex0sjf7,t3_cqwxkd,1565921176.0,"Yes, I'm a full time stepmom for my SD12. I also just had my first child 6 months ago. He's the reason I'm a SAHM but my husband also wants me to do basically everything for his daughter too. Her BM is a heroin addict and hasn't seen her in a few years. SD has abandonment issues and major self esteem problems. She also, within the last year to two years, has decided she's gay. We believe it's because of the lack of motherly love and affection she should have been receiving throughout her childhood (but didn't because of her messed up mother and her father's lack of affection from his parents while growing up) that makes her crave affection from her best friend (who doesn't like her in that way). 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to connect with her until this summer when we were together every single day. I want her to feel like I'm her mom and I want to feel that way as well but then there's my son whom I love more than I ever imagined I could. I now know what being a mom feels like and I'm unable to give the same to my SD. I sometimes feel like I'm also contributing to her issues because of this. Not everyone is able to love any child as their own. I do my best but I feel like my husband definitely shouldn't be pushing everything on me and expect me to act as if she is my real child. He doesn't understand what it feels like because he's never been a step-parent.

I feel like I'm rambling but it's nice to be able to get this out. And, WOW, it's crazy how many of us in the same situation there are!"
Parenting,eq8h8ip,t3_bxlhoz,1559865321.0,I can relate 100%. I am a stepmother to my husband's 12 year old daughter and I just had my first bio son 4 months ago. I automatically loved him so much more than her and I've been in her life since she was 5 and helped my husband get full custody from her drug addict mother. I care a lot about her but it doesn't compare to how I feel for my son. I also can't talk to my husband about this because it would break his heart as well as hers. I worried throughout my pregnancy if I'd be able to treat them as if I love them the same but it's difficult. Especially since my stepdaughter is going through puberty and is starting to withdraw from both of us so it's even harder to get on her good side sometimes. I sometimes do feel like a bad person for how I feel but also we're all different and can't help what our true feelings are. I'm still there for her as much as I can be with a new baby in the house. My husband doesn't bring it up but I think deep down he knows.
