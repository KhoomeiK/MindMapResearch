I have self harm scars on my legs and I didn’t wear shorts for years but in the past few years I just stopped caring and it’s really freeing."
BPD,foy5y8z,t3_ga92f4,1588166071.0,I’m proud of you !
depression,fob29pv,t3_g6nsxz,1587655315.0,You should talk to your doc about this. There’s different types of antidepressants that don’t normally cause sex side effects. I had the same issue any my psychiatrist said it’s really common and it’s actually the most common reason that people stop taking anti depressants.
ADHD,fo6vgk1,t3_g62gsc,1587567479.0,Don’t overthink it. Communication is the most important thing. Just ask him what you can do to support him.

This doesn’t always mean that it’s harmful for the baby( there are many medications that are safe during pregnancy). The best person to ask this question would be her obgyn, not strangers on the internet. Especially when it comes to the health of your child."
depression,firqgxf,t1_firotae,1582669431.0,"Yeah like I live in Columbus and OSU, Ohio health, and mount caramel( 3 major hospitals in Columbus) all give financial aid to low income people without insurance. You can mention all these concerns to your therapist and they will probably have more info about that. You should just be honest with your therapist. I know that the possibility of being hospitalized is really scary, but my experience it really wasn’t that bad just boring. But it also gave me a break I needed from life stresses and the stability to make healthier changes and start thinking more clearly."
nightwalk,firlvpx,t3_f9cexg,1582666860.0,Walk with confidence and people are less likely to mess with you and carry pepper spray or a knife and don’t wear headphones
depression,firkzfm,t1_firdg60,1582666375.0,Are you working right now ? If you don’t have any income there are financial assistance programs at non profit hospitals. Im from the US (Ohio) and I’ve gotten financial assistance from hospitals even when I was working but was low income. I know it’s scary but this might be the best thing for you right now. They can give you medication to help and refer you to a therapist when you get out and they will have social workers that can help. I’ve been to a mental hospital before and I was also really scared at first but it ended up being what I needed to make changes in my life. Good luck:)
