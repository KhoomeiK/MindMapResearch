ptsd,f9i2du4,t1_f9i1zs1,1575326645.0,"Ah, yeah, I see what you mean.  I have PTSD from long-term trauma and abuse,  so I can see why there's a group for sufferers of complex trauma, but I can see why this place would be more comfortable.  It kinda is for me too."
ptsd,f9i1qdu,t1_f9f6dev,1575326216.0,"Oh I got you.  Thanks for clarifying. That always bothers me too. I've been dealing with it for awhile but was just given a diagnosis.  I definitely see it because overused a lot and it doesn't help with my shame.

Were you talking somewhat about the C-PTSD sub?

Edit: question"
ptsd,f9hyqkm,t3_e52jzp,1575324381.0,"Yeah man,  I think I have been dealing with it for a while but I am newly diagnosed and we're not sure if it's complex or not. While I'm relieved that I have a name for what ales me, it's definitely not fun to deal with!   It's got me all kinds of messed up."
ptsd,f9hy26h,t3_e502cx,1575323993.0,"Hey, I have PTSD  from a lifetime of trauma and abuse. I have unintentionally hurt people during outbursts (not physically, but I've said things I shouldn't have said) whenever I've done this I regretted as soon as I calmed down,  apologized and made more effort to handle things better in the future. It's not your job to walk on eggshells around her. Do people trigger me sometimes? Yes! Do I sometimes act in ways I shouldn't out of anger? Yes! Is my PTSD an excuse for bad behavior? FUCK NO!! People with PTSD will have outbursts and handle things the wrong way sometimes,  but for most of us, it's not something we want to keep doing. If I handle something the wrong way, I feel like a monster and I make a serious effort not to do it again! I know you probably love her, but it's not worth the trauma it's causing you! Please consider getting both of you some help,  and leaving for your own sanity. 

I'm not a psych, but this doesn't sound like a PTSD problem. I'm not saying she doesn't have PTSD,  but there's definitely more to it than just PTSD.  Sounds more like a cluster b personality disorder, which are often comorbid with PTSD. I hope this helps! Reach out if you need anything or just someone to talk to."

raisedbynarcissists,f8bgs7k,t3_dzx164,1574436519.0,"I thought it was just me and it has gotten me preyed on!!! I feel stupid,  but I just wanna be loved. I met an older person when I was 17 and they treated me nicely,  validated the things that were going in my life, etc. They groomed me for 4 years and ended up  abusing me. I still feel like I deserve what happened because I should have known better. It's hard when you have no concept of what love should be but you want it so bad. Please,  please be careful!"

raisedbynarcissists,f6exeah,t3_dr2hbt,1572808677.0,I constantly worry that I am a/the narcissist. I don't have kids but I can definitely relate  to that fear. I don't know what to think or how to get to the bottom of it.
raisedbynarcissists,f69vl45,t3_dqr5sp,1572748191.0,"My mom does something similar. She regularly reminds me how much of a pain my having a job is for her, and how ungrateful I am for the fact that she takes me.  She wants me on social security (I'm disabled) but I'm working on getting my license and finding full time employment.  She also likes to threaten me by telling me that she'll just stop taking me and I'll have nothing.  I don't know if this is narcissistic or abusive,  but it happens."
