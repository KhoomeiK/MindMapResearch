mentalhealth,fcwvajs,t3_ejbix4,1578039088.0,"I have it. What ive learned is that talk therapy and dbt has helped a lot. The thing about BPD is that you have to adapt to it and learn what of it really affects you. Then with that knowledge learn and apply healthy coping mechanisms or strategies for when certain bad thoughts or habits start to come up. It is overwhelming at first and will take a lot of self discipline with or without professional health. Just remember to not get mad at yourself. For me it impacted my personal relationships as I have gotten ""attached"" to people throughout my life. I had to learn to set up healthy boundaries with those people and now my relationships with those people have improved immensely. Wish you the best."
mentalhealth,fcwuyxl,t3_ejai7z,1578038703.0,"I have found that the counseling services at colleges are sub par. If you can, call your insurance company and see what talk therapists are under your insurance plan. Definitely a good start. It is really important to find someone you click with ðŸ˜Š best advice is dont settle and look at every option you can come across. Places with a sliding scale could also be helpful."

He collapsed one day and turns out they failed to tell us that he had a terrible heart condition. We spent the next two weeks with him just letting him be a puppy and eat all of the peanut butter. ðŸ’œ it is never easy to lose a sweet animal. I really think they teach us so much about compassion.
