I know it's hard, that there is no motivation to do a thing, but just simply don't think about it. Distract your mind from it."
depression,fcnrru9,t3_ei5aa3,1577817193.0,What happened the first time you looked for help?
depression,fcn16ln,t1_fb762sj,1577800284.0,I don't know. Lost confidence I guess. I feel very lonely nowadays. I don't have any friends at work and the friends I've got are always busy. When I call them to hang out they usually can't or they end up not showing because something came up. That brings me down more. I guess I need to start working on living by my own and make the most out of small things. But it is extremely difficult for me. Sometimes I've got it under control and sometimes everything is falling apart.
depression,f7yx2wy,t1_f7vqtum,1574102008.0,"I used to run for two years straight, lost 35 kg, I ran for an hour and a half 15km, then I hit depression. It's been a year since and I haven't got back to run, don't feel like it, lack of motivation, gained a lot of weight. My brother wanted to start running last week, I could use that to go and start running again. Maybe you can go run with somebody else too. But it bumps me so hard that I lost everything I worked so hard to achieve in those two years."
