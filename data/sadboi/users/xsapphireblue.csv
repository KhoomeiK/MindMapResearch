I just rewatched the movies and read a little of the books this week (haven't in a few years) and felt bad that Jacob was basically being strung along by Bella in Eclipse and think he deserves to be with someone not related to Bella or the Cullens (no hate though). I also think that would be a really weird conversation when Renesmee's older (how he was in love with her mom, etc.) and I hope that somehow they both can end up with different people. I also wasn't a fan of Renesmee's storyline, it seemed out of character for Bella to become obsessed with having the baby and possibly putting other lives at risk if Renesmee had turned out to be dangerous."

One day he was on the train and supposedly encountered one that he communicated with telepathically (I’m trying to find the link to it). Yeah I think the ones with the bruises could’ve been physical and I’ve heard the Greys aren’t so good too. There was an unusually high amount of UFO activity in that area, I think most of them might’ve been the greys. I looked up sightings in the area and on the map there were a lot of sightings on some of those highways I used to drive near his town. My town didn’t have very many (I think only one or two reported on there) but one of the sightings on the map was very close to my house (which gave me the chills). Since I had started seeing the lights/crafts very often I had asked my ex when I was at his house one time if he ever saw anything weird in the sky at night and showed him pictures on google that were similar to the things I saw. He hadn’t seen any of those (though I don’t think he drove at night as much) though said he used to have a lot of encounters with spirits.

They didn’t feel too hostile fortunately and the Nordics seemed to be more gentle. My last dream with them, before I’d went to sleep that night I drove up to my ex’s place and I saw one of the diamond formation in the sky on the way.

I had brushed it off as a dream but woke up with bruises on my knuckles a few times which made me question it. I had a few different dreams with them but don’t remember as much. In one with the Nordics, I had walked outside of my house in the dream when I was home alone and saw a spacecraft come up behind my neighbor’s house across the street. Two guys were walking by my house then and saw it and gasped and a white light shone out of it and froze them and I quickly turned around and went back inside. I was in my room for a little bit and the craft flew behind my house in the dream and the white light shined through my window and froze me and pulled me into the ship with it.

AskReddit,f2ckboi,t3_dcq8qm,1570139051.0,"I think my worst memory was in 5th grade. A close friend had turned on me after we had an argument and turned the other two girls in our friend group against me and bullied me. One morning when we were lining up outside before school she made a fist at me and yelled an insult when she saw me look over at the three of them talking. I was trying not to cry so I turned around and walked away from the line (was going to hide in the bathroom and cry and not go to class). My (abusive) mom unfortunately walked over just then, she unexpectedly decided to come by the line after dropping off my brother at kindergarten and asked where I was going. I said, ""I want to go home,"" and was tearing up then. ""Why?"" she snapped and got mad when I wouldn't give more details about what was happening (she already knew I was being bullied).

 She then started screaming and cussing at my 5th grade class and I shouted at her to stop it.  I ran away to the bathroom in horror and locked myself  inside a stall and started crying. My mom just complained about me to the principal since she saw her on the school yard and left me at school. A few minutes later principal comes into the bathroom and made me go to her office to talk and I told her what happened though none of the bullies ever got in trouble."
AskReddit,f28zrb5,t1_f273845,1570075425.0,"This happened to my cousin and she trapped him with two kids. When they started having problems she purposely got pregnant and then stopped working after (hasn’t worked for a few years since before she had the kids) and just lives off of him now. Once when she wanted to break up, she tried calling the police and said he hit her (which never happened) and he got arrested and had to spend a night in jail. She made up with him later and dropped the charges after. 

He got a better paying job and even bought a house and married her later (he wanted to be in his kids lives and my relatives are conservative and old fashioned). Though I’m completely disgusted with her and women who do that and would not want to force that on a guy."

AskMen,f1qesnn,t3_dac1iv,1569699304.0,"I like guys who know how to cook and take care of themselves, it shows independence and I think there's nothing wrong with a guy liking cooking. I  can't stand guys who just expect the woman to do everything. My ex-bf and I used to always split cooking or sometimes cook together if we had time. One of his roommates though was the complete opposite and made his gf do everything, left messes everywhere and ate everyone else's food, and didn't even know how to wash dishes or cook for himself (and he was in his 30s).

I've also had friends who bf's make them do all the cooking and cleaning and refuse to do anything (which I find extremely off putting). I think it's great that you enjoy cooking and there's nothing wrong with it."

My mom had been screaming at me all morning and rushing me to get ready for school. I walked into the living room once I finished getting ready and saw her standing frozen watching the TV news. I said, ""Mom, come on I'm ready for school."" 

""Well you're not going today.""

""But I'm going to be late.""

""Well, no one's going to be there,"" she continued staring at the TV.  I saw the clip of the airplane crashing into the Twin Towers right after that and knew that was why.  I remember being a little annoyed that she'd made a huge fuss waking me up and rushing me to get ready if I wasn't going to be going. I also remember hearing after that people thought there might be attacks towards schools so I just went back upstairs. My aunt also worked in the Twin Towers during that time but fortunately was on a medical leave when the attacks happened (she knew some of the people who died)."
