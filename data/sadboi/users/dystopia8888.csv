It gets to the point where people can't stand me anymore because I want to make sure they wouldn't leave me and I test them, as if they are supposed to love me unconditionally and tolerate absolutely everything."

I make a mistake at work but I don't dwell on that for hours, don't feel the urge to fix everything like it used to be before taking the medicine. This is huge for me. I have noticed that sometimes my anxiety kicks in but I can overcome it because for me the benefits that I can concentrate and read again out-weight my anxiety (I always had anxiety, I don't think my anxiety levels have increased on the bupropion, my anxiety is just different now and it is manageable). I am motivated to learn something new and lose a few pounds. You should give it a shot and wait for at least 2 months."

Also it feels somehow better to be stably suicidal than unstable and get excited over minor things, I felt more mature, I know it sounds odd. 

I know people get suicidal on it. I just thought that if I am too excited on the bupropion alone and get suicidal when on both the stabilizer and the bupropion, maybe this medication would slowly make me psychotic again. Mania feels great during its initial stages. Idk if that makes nay sense though."

However, oficially I am borderline and, maybe, cyclothymic. I have had one amphetamine-induced psychotic mania. Other hypomanias were left unnoticed, I believe. Mostly I have mixed episodes. I know I need stabilizers. It is not up to me to self regulate being unmedicated. :( I am one of those bipolars who don't seek treatment because I have had very bad experience in my teens.

I imagine myself being emotionless while on stabilizers doing things like other people do. Normally my overwhelming emotions would prevent me from doing anything long term requiring dedication, determination and strong will. Maybe if I am medicated I could finally understand what I truly value in my life and what my hobbies are, and stick to them. If I am too sedated well then it is impossible. Maybe this is in our nature to feel we are overly sedated when on drugs whereas non BP people feel this way all the time and do lots of things in order to entertain themselves  - once you feel such powerful emotions you will never forget them, less intense emotions will always feel 'flat'.
