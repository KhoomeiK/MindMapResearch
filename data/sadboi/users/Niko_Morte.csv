ptsd,ewmiygy,t3_cozm8z,1565552792.0,"So, I've had this issue quite a few times, and here's what I found that works for me:

1: Step into another room. Doing this can trick your mind into focusing on something else. Kind of like how you walk into a room and completely forget why you walked in. Try to force this on yourself as a kind of reset.

2: Breathe. The old adage goes ""seven seconds in the nose, seven seconds out of the mouth"". Focus on that. It's annoying as all fuck, but it really helps. 

3: Bounce a ball. Don't throw it, bounce it. Up and down, left and right, just bounce it. Bonus points if it lights up. 

4: Get some kind of tactile feedback. I'm huge on textures of things. I run my hands over them and think about what the feeling resembles to me. Does this wall feel like sandpaper, or does it feel like leather?

5: Call your mom. Even if it's just to tell her that you need to talk because you're having a rough time. Mom's always seem to know what to say.

6: Take a walk. Walk aggressively, but comfortably. Get those steps in and cool your jets. 

7: Drink water and eat something healthy. This is self explainatory.

I hope this helps, it does for me. PM if you ever need to talk, we're all in this together."

AskReddit,esf34dp,t3_c7agc2,1561915952.0,"A few years ago I met this guy on Destiny. He was pretty cool, hilarious as hell, and seemed like a good person to hangout with. We shared a lot of the same interests, and had the same soldier's sense of humor. After playing a few weeks, we finally get to the ""so where you from?"" conversation. In an insane turn of events, the dude lived across town from me. 

We start hanging out, and dude becomes my best friend. He never showed any signs that there were things seriously wrong with him mentally. A few months ago, he and his roommate (who had moved into town from out of state a week earlier) were watching my son over Spring break. I come home from work to find my son freaked out, almost shaking, and saying that something wasn't right with dude. After dude goes home, my son tells me that he was acting ""scary weird"". Dude went down to the basement, came back up naked, and was playing with himself while walking around the house. When I called the roommate, he confirmed and said that dude also pointed loaded firearms at both he and my son a few days previously.  When I went downstairs, there was a baggie of shrooms laying out on the floor. Needless to say, I went ballistic. 

Dude denied everything that was said, and called every single one of us liars. I knew that his cousin was a street pharmacist, and called him out on it. Dude wanted to play hardball and started making threats. Calling the police did nothing, as they said that without photo or video proof, they couldn't make a case (#thanksrandomohiopolicedpt)."
