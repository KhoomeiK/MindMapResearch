NCSU,fne7vwm,t1_fne7ehy,1586884608.0,"Well I'm glad you feel better. My only piece of advice with this: be careful to not lose motivation during a gap year. Taking time off of school makes you not wanna go back. 

Education is an amazing opportunity to get where you want in this world, so if you really want to leave State, I'd recommend trying to enroll in community college sooner than later. 

But I'd also recommend talking to your parents or an advisor, rather than a random dude on reddit lol"
NCSU,fne5lg1,t3_g192mb,1586883461.0,"First off, you're not a failure, don't think like that. 

Secondly, attending college is a tremendous opportunity, and if you feel like you can keep going, I'd recommend to keep trying at State. BUT if you really feel hopeless, there is NOTHING wrong with transferring to a community college to figure out what you enjoy, and then transferring back to State or elsewhere"
