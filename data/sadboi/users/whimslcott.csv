There is a lot of RSS propaganda going around that Ambedkar eventually decided against Sikhism and Islam and Christianity because those religions were casteist, but that flies in the face of what he really said and did his entire life. If you read What Path To Salvation for example he refutes it thoroughly.

http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_salvation.html

Honestly, the process of elimination I think is something that is understudied but the evidence doesn't suggest that the mass conversion to Buddhism happened just because Ambedkar personally thought Buddhism slapped (tho he did)."

http://malcolmxfiles.blogspot.com/2013/07/robert-penn-warren-interviews-malcolm-x.html

Malcolm X: I have never seen white people who would sit...who would...who would approach a solution to their own problems non-violently or passively. It’s only when they are so-called “fighting for the rights of Negroes” that they non-violently, passively and lovingly, you know, approach the situation. But when the whites themselves are attacked, they believe in defending themselves and things of that sort. But those type of whites who are always going to jail with Negroes are the ones who tell Negroes to be loving and be kind and be patient and be non-violent and turn the other cheek.

Warren: But...

Malcolm X: So if I did see a white man who was willing to go to jail or throw himself in front of a car in behalf of the so-called Negro cause, the test that I’d put to him, I’d ask him, “Do you think when Negroes are being attacked they should defend themselves even at the risk of having to kill the one who’s attacking them?” If that white man told me, “Yes,” I’d shake his hand. I’d trust in him. But I don’t trust any white man who teaches Negroes to turn the other cheek or to be non-violent, which means to be defenseless in the face of a very brutal, criminal enemy. No. That’s my yardstick for measuring whites.

Warren: Now, the question, what is defenseless at this point?

Malcolm X: Any time you tell a man to turn the other cheek or to be non-violent in the face of a violent enemy, you’re making that man defenseless. You’re robbing him of his God-given right to defend himself.

Warren: Let’s take a concrete case again on the question of defenselessness just to be sure I understand you. If, say, in the case of Dr. Aaron Henry in Mississippi Clarksdale, Mississippi, his house has been bombed and has been shot through and that sort of thing. Well, he is armed. I’ve been in his house. I know he’s armed. His guards are sitting there with arms with the arms that they’re in their hands at night. And everybody knows this. Now, I can’t see how anyone would ask him not to defend himself, you see? If defense is literally defense, as it’s taken in ordinary legal times, or a mounted aggression for purposes of defense is another thing in society, you see what I’m getting at? A man sitting in his own house...

Malcolm X: I think that a Negro...

Warren: ...is one thing. A man who goes out and performs an act of violence as is some sort of a long-range defense.

Malcolm X: I think that the Negro should reserve the right to execute any measure necessary to defend himself. Any way, any form necessary to defend himself, he should reserve the right to do that just the same as others have the right to do it."
