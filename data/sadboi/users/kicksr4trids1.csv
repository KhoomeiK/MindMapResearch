I took a trip with my husband and a couple of friends in 2018 to Torchlake, MI. It was around my birthday. On my birthday,we decided to check out the local stores and we were in a toy shop looking for board games to play together. The radio was playing in the background and we were the only ones in the shop at the time. A song comes on the radio and I’m thinking, they don’t play that particular song by this artist very often. It was Moonshadow, by Cat Stevens. This may not be significant to most, but, that is the song my mom used to sing to me when I was a baby/ toddler. I immediately got chills( good chills) and started crying. I am 100% positive she was communicating with me. She was letting me know that she is still with me no matter what and she’s ok. So, just know that your mom is communicating in small ways, you have to be open to it and take it as face value. After that, there were and are several ways  she communicates, mostly by numbers, DOB. It’s sounds crazy I know,  but I work in a pharmacy and we have to ask DOB, several times in a row I will get a person with my mom’s DOB or mine. I can’t explain it. That’s her way of communicating. I hope this helps. Hugs!!"

This is just my opinion. I love all of Doctor Who, but his years were to me  stellar. David Tennant has been in a lot of shows American and British. I just think he’s a really good actor.

It’s called the 478 method. Also, I’m giving you a link that will help with breathing on a normal day or situation that may help. 

First the daily breathing exercises: 

https://www.healthline.com/health/get-serious-about-severe-asthma/breathing-exercises-severe-asthma#1

Second exercise for anxiety:


https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417


I recommend this type of breathing exercise for when you are in a comfortable environment at home and not driving! This method is strictly to relax you. I swear by it, it has helped me many nights when I can’t sleep. This is not an asthma breathing exercise. But, it’s for anxiety. 

          I can remember as a kid getting so anxious about my asthma and I would work myself up into a worse attack, granted not like yours but pretty severe. My mom one time said to me, and this may help during the “ buildup” if you are able to talk you are breathing. I don’t know why this helped me but it was a mental trick I guess to help me calm down. 

I really hope this helps. It’s awful enough to have asthma but as most asthmatics do, we have anxiety around our asthma. It’s a vicious cycle. Take care of yourself!"
