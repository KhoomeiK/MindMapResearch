I hope you get some much needed answers soon 💜 and I hope it's not stupid lupus, but it does kinda sound like it from the symptoms you've described. If you experience brain fog or abnormal feelings of depression, be sure to keep a record of it to report back to your doctors. It took me 2.5 years to finally get a diagnosis and what ultimately did it, was a notebook I kept with all my symptoms, photos of rashes, swelling, clumps of hair, etc., as well as ALL labs, scans, hospitalizations, & Dr visits. It's a pain in the butt to keep up, BUT it does help you feel like you've got some sort of control over your medical situation, which can help psychologically... Sometimes🤷🏽‍♀️.

askdoctors,fqy8omm,t3_glej5z,1589744514.0,"Hi, I'm not a Dr., so I hope I'm allowed to comment here. You should really go get your testosterone checked.  You could have low testosterone. Also, there are certain foods (ie soy) that can lower testosterone. Do a Google search for both foods that boost and foods that lower testosterone (you'll be shocked at some of the things!). My best friend has low T and many similarities to what you've described, so this advice is actually from him, but we both suggest you go to a urologist who specializes in these types of issues. You're less likely to run into a bunch of coronavirus patients there than an ER or primary care doctor. Also, you may be able to do a telemedicine visit initially, although you'll then need to get labs to test your T levels. Don't wait too long to get this checked out though, because it could be something besides low T that needs to be addressed now before things get worse. If you don't have insurance or can't dish out money for a Dr right now, then GNC has some supplements for testerone that work fairly well (but not as well as regular testerone shots if that's what you need) and could maybe help you out in the interim. Best of luck to you and try your best not to worry yourself too much -- I know...easier said than done. The 🍆 will rise again, though, and hopefully without having to use Viagra at such a young age. 😊💜"
ChronicIllness,fqerphp,t1_fqdwv2e,1589312490.0,Look up Yoga with Adrienne on You Tube. She is WONDERFUL!! All her videos are free and she's literally got a video for everything & anything including many for chronic pain. I do one of her bedtime routines pretty much every night before bed and it's the only thing that keeps me from waking up with excruciating neck and back pain. It's only 20 minutes and is so calming and relaxing that it also helps a bit with my insomnia from medrol. Hope you find as much value in Adrienne's yoga videos as I have 💜🥰 Sending you gentle hugs and healing energy 🤗💕

Fibromyalgia,fo1yth8,t3_g4zuhp,1587444847.0,"I have lupus and suspected fibro as well. I was diagnosed with lupus about 13 years ago and at the time I had more friends than I could even keep up with. Today I might have 3 at best and that's probably being optimistic. It is really hard losing friends in the process of having a chronic illness and chronic pain. it's kind of like an extra slap in the face when you're already miserable and suffering. I wish I had some advice for you but I honestly don't, other than to remember to appreciate whoever has stuck around. Also, it's such a beautiful thing that you have a boyfriend (who is also very understanding) as well because being single while dealing with a chronic illness reallllly sucks. Also, and I know this is a tricky one, but it doesn't sound like your doctors have your pain at a manageable level yet, so keep on them about that and if your doctors won't or can't help, then find a doctor(s) that will. Pain management was a nightmare for me, but it's also how I eventually found out about kratom (which is kind of a pain in the butt) but also so much better IMO than dealing with the alternative Rx. Not advocating - just sharing my experiences. I really hope things get better for you soon. 🥰🤗 Reddit has become the only place where I can find people who I can relate to, so hopefully that helps for you as well. 💜💜💜"

FloridaTrees,fnudbza,t1_fnuakv4,1587259590.0,"Absolutely! I really hope this works for you! There were a few vapes that helped when I first started trying things out, but eventually I found myself waking up in pain in the middle of the night too. I think you're going to absolutely LOVE that first great night of sleep you get from the RSO! Just play around with the dosage until you find the sweet spot.  💚😊🌱

There's one thing I feel like I should mention just in case anyone is dealing with a lot of ""stuff."" Who isn't right now, though, right?! But in all seriousness, if I mistakenly take too much of the Indica RSO ( I've done it 3 times 🤦🏽‍♀️), it takes me on a VERY depressing & emotional journey of ALL that is wrong in my life. Sometimes it's helpful just to get the emotions out, but mostly it's just depressing, so squeeze that syringe with a light hand when starting out ☺️ Other than that, this stuff rocks!!  Fingers crossed that this helps you get some much needed sleep to help ease your pain 💜🤞🏼💜🤗"
depression_help,fnuagy7,t3_g3sbvy,1587257899.0,"Sounds like a good read. I've been more depressed the last 3 or 4 years than I've ever been in my life, but I really don't want to get back in the routine of taking antidepressants because I don't think they actually work anyway. What works is making changes to my life, getting rid of toxic people, and not allowing people to shit all over me just because they are my elders or a family member. It takes more a bit more than JUST that, of course, but just pointing out that if the pills ever did any good, it was very minimal. I will definitely be checking this book out. Sometimes just having validation can help get you out of a dark place. Thank you for the recommendation 😊💜"

I wake up refreshed and also my usually high blood pressure is significantly reduced. it also lasts longer than any of the other products that I've tried from any of the FL dispensaries. I just put a little blob of it in the middle of a tiny piece of bread and then gently roll it into a ball and swallow it like a pill.

It seems like such a no-brainer to me -- that's what a friend does when they care--but I found that the most empathetic people are usually the ones who are going through something themselves and the rest are just clueless or selfish, whichever applies best. I'm not saying that that's your parents at all, but that I can truly understand your frustration. Good for you, though, for being your own advocate and doing what you need to do just for you.

I'd rather have you take Kratom than anything else especially what you WERE on (50mcg fentanyl patch & oxy10/325 for breakthrough). My brother takes Kratom and is a huge advocate for it. "" THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL I could have said this to any of my other doctors, who are considerably older and pretty much in the dark or have their ears closed to anything new.

I thought one was about plainly not believing the existence of a god and the other was just neutral (doesn't believe nor disbelieve). Forgive my ignorance -- I'm new here and never really even thought to give my belief any kind of label until I searched Google the other day lol."

ChronicPain,finrwzu,t3_f8s8ac,1582568983.0,"In addition to nightly meditation/hypnosis, I have just recently started doing a 20 minute nighttime yoga routine that I found on YouTube and just that alone has SIGNIFICANTLY helped my pain levels already, especially in the morning when things usually REALLY suck lol. It's encouraged me to try out some physical therapy as well, because I honestly thought all of that was a bunch of hooey for people without ""REAL""  pain OR just another worthless and expensive thing that the equally as worthless and expensive Dr sent you off to do.🤷🏽‍♀️ 

I guess It just takes finding the right type of exercise that works best for your body and your pain. I know that I'm not going to be doing a Zumba class anytime soon lol, but light yoga and stretching every single day is amazing 😻 I also just added a quick morning yoga today and I can feel the difference its made as I sit here working at my computer (which feels like I'm slowly murdering my entire spine 8+ hours a day, btw lol). I highly recommend going on YouTube and checking out the great yoga and physical therapy resources. I'm a fan of ""Yoga with Adrienne"" and also ""Bob & Brad (🎶 the 2 most famous.. physical therapists.. on the internet🎶😛)"" -- If you're familiar with Bob & Brad, you'll appreciate the little tune there). Check them out or just search You Tube -- you might just find something there that's just what you need 😊💜🧘 Best of luck and may you have more pain free days ahead 💜"

trees,fim0lc8,t1_filiqys,1582514972.0,"Wow! Cool tip!! I've never heard that before! Is there actually enough THC left in the vaped herb to create potent edibles or do you just have to use a larger amount of it? 

I keep hearing so many good things about dry herb vaping. I really hate the harsh feel of smoking, but it's what I've found works best for getting the full effects. Do you get the same effects from vaping flower as you would from smoking it?

My experience with vaping cannabis oil have always been pretty meh (for helping pain) and I've tried a LOT of the different strains available. When I finally decided to try using the flower, the results were 👌 and I was FINALLY able to say confidently that yes, MMJ DOES actually help with my chronic pain.  I'm just a bit hesitant to drop a chunk of money on a dry herb vape if it has the same unhelpful effects as the oil vapes.  Do you have any recommendations on a certain type or brand?"

Not that it makes it any more (or less) rude, ignorant, and insensitive, but I'm hoping you don't have to deal with that type of ""crappy doctor attitude"" to help you with your pain issues. People can truly never understand chronic pain until they've actually dealt with it themselves. I believe that pain is relative and chronic pain is almost a whole other animal in the way that it affects EVERY aspect of life... potentially FOREVER. It takes a major toll on a person, especially mentally & emotionally, and that's the part that many people just don't understand. 😒 Sorry you had to deal with that."

I have an appointment coming up with my rheumatologist and I plan to have a heart-to-heart with him about just this.  I just want to be able to enjoy my life & at this point I struggle to say that I tolerate it lol 😑. My dream Dr would be one who actually struggles with an autoimmune disease with chronic pain, and can truly relate and feel what the rest of us go through -- not that I'd wish this on ANYONE-- but it's just that the only people who really ""get it"" are the ones (like us) who've got it!?! 🤷🏽‍♀️ I'm still hopeful about stem cell research and autoimmune diseases, though. 🤞🏼🤞🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 You hang in there too💜☺️🤗"

lupus,f0mqxvm,t3_d5kl5l,1568751171.0,"Just coming here and asking questions like this so that you'll be a loving, support system for your fiance tells me you're already on the right track. Just ask, listen, and know that things can change from one day or even one hour to the next. It gets scary to make plans for fear of  having to cancel, but let her know you understand and that you support whatever choice is best for her health.  Stress is a major trigger for flares, so keeping stress at bay can help reduce flares. 

I've only read about neurological lupus symptoms like what you've described. It's not very common but it sounds like it was finally diagnosed early enough to calm everything down. The Prednisone is wonderful for that, but then things like that moonface really suck. There's really no magic formula to get rid of moonface, BUT I have found that taking Medrol (methylprednisolone) instead of prednisone keeps the moonface to a minimum. It works just as well as prednisone, but just costs more. I never take regular prednisone anymore for that reason but mostly because it makes me a little crazy 😬, aggressive🤯 and over emotional😵 lol. I can laugh about it now but it really sucked years ago thinking I was losing it. Keep an eye out for adverse reactions to the prednisone and just know there's an alternative that may work better. All the best to you both and congratulations on your upcoming marriage 💕💜💕"

I have other chronic pain issues along with SLE, and between the two, it's nearly impossible to just hang with people without planning and provisions (ie heating pad(s), pain meds, backup charger for heating pads, back brace, etc).

ChronicPain,ey1zl72,t3_cv230z,1566717707.0,"I also used to have neverending headaches that were worse at night and made it very painful to even lay my head down. I've got DDD, SLE, and my C2-C7 are all herniated. I've got some other health issues going on but those are the ones that I think mostly contribute to this particular pain issue. Anyway, I started seeing a chiropractor a few months ago and it's helped lessen the frequency of the headaches and head pain from anything touching my head. The chiropractor said it was basically (paraphrasing) the pinched nerves in my fascia being very ""angry"" and painful because of the problems in my neck. I'm not sure about much of anything these days in terms of treatment or cures, BUT the chiropractic does seem to help a bit. Just thought I'd throw it out there in case you hadn't tried it already. I'm sorry for your constant headaches. It can really suck the joy out of an otherwise decent day. ☹️💜💕"
kratom,evukhs7,t1_evub5by,1564797817.0,"@dsparke, Measurements vary slightly because of different consistencies of Kratom, but as a general guide: 1tsp equals approximately 2.4 grams of Kratom. Capsules (size 00) hold about .5 grams of Kratom. So 1/2 tsp (~1.2g) is roughly 3 capsules. If you're using capsules, though, just remember you'll need a bit more than if you were taking it straight. It also takes longer to digest and kick in. You'll find your sweet spot (and fave method to take it) with time and experience, though 😊 If you don't get your desired effects after an hour, then add another capsule until you do. I started with capsules, then tea, and now I'm tossing and washing like a pro lol. T & W (toss & wash) works SOOOO much quicker and easier, but it can be daunting to try. Took me a month and lots of puking and unrelieved pain until I finally broke down and tried T & W. I've never looked back, though. Good luck and good health! 😊"
lupus,etjbrdw,t1_eth5y3x,1562870288.0,"This is such a great thread! I just wanted to add to the comments about the pros of plaquenil. I've had SLE for about 13 years. I made it through 9 of those with no major organ involvement. However, there was a major shortage on plaquenil several years back and the price of it was through the roof and unaffordable to me at that time, as I didn't have health insurance. Anyway, I had to go almost 5 months without plaquenil and I THOUGHT everything was okay because I felt  totally fine... Until I didn't. I suddenly and quickly fell very ill and ended up in the hospital diagnosed with class 3 lupus nephritis (just a few points away from being considered class 4). It was a huge blow and a major game changer because lupus (once under control) never really threatened my life until then. Now I have to be extra vigilant about trying to keep my kidneys stable because the next step is dialysis and/or kidney transplant. It was ALL from not taking my plaquenil for those 5 or 6 months, though. Really hard to lesson learned 😣. Please, please, pleeeease check into and consider trying the plaquenil  so you don't end up in a pickle like me or worse 🙏💜. Just get regular ""plaquenil eye exams"" to avoid the worst side effect of potentially losing your vision. It's something they can catch in time as long as you regularly monitor it. All the best to all of you Lupus warriors 💜💪"
kratom,ery515a,t3_c4p86y,1561400570.0,"Congratulations!!!! I agree that the RSO helps. It didn't help me so much with the withdrawals, but it did help a LOT for sleep and kind of ""re-setting"" my body after so many years on Rx opiods. Do you plan on getting off of Kratom as well or do you still need it for managing pain?"
kratom,ery3tn6,t1_erx8779,1561399781.0,"People can be so hateful and nasty, especially when they're sitting behind a computer (or phone) far, far away from getting bitch slapped by the people they're being rude to lol. Block, ignore, and don't give them another thought or invitation into your head or heart. 💜

As for your issues with taking kratom, I would highly recommend the oblate discs for you. Just fill them with enough powder so that they won't get stuck in your throat and double bag them because they dissolve very easily when wet. I imagine there's probably a lot of swishing and trying to swallow with you (I had a friend as a teen who had the same issues with swallowing pills), so double or even triple bag it until you get the hang of swallowing them. ALSO, good news -- you can take it with water and not ever have to taste anything. I used to use them like that so that I wasn't consuming so much sugary juice. I get it. Other options:
1. Applesauce (unsweetened)
2. Pudding (fat free)
3. Milk or almond milk
4. TRUlime or TRUlemon packets that you add to bottled water for flavor. They're sweetened with Stevia and like 1 calorie I think. 

Good luck and let us know what works best. There will definitely be a noob searching for the same answers one of these days and they'll appreciate the follow up 😊💜🌿"
kratom,eru9uwe,t1_ertwi88,1561268764.0,"Just use it on a regular basis to control chronic pain and you will very quickly see just how inconsistent Kratom is, regardless of which method you use to take it orally. Speaking from just under 2 months of experience, but it's still very true. 🤷 I wish there was more research as well (I truly don't want to go back into pain mgmt and Rx opiods again), but that usually brings about looming govt control/""regulation,"" which is pretty much ALWAYS a nightmare in this country."
FloridaTrees,eru4shm,t1_erp6lip,1561263072.0,"I've tried a lot of their concentrates and I'd say the only one I just can't recommended is the TruShatter. I think this is a dab? They just have the nastiest taste and the effects seen very dulled out in comparison to the same strain in either flower or vape cart. I haven't tried the new Rosin yet, though. I've heard good things. Most of their oral concentrates are all very good, though. I just think their recommended dosing is off  because it usually takes a significantly bigger dose in order to feel the pain relieving effects of the full body high. It could just be me and my chemistry, but I've heard a few others say the same. 🤷 I could also be developing a bit of a tolerance. I'd recommend Trulieve any day though, in general, because they have such a great exchange policy (most dispensaries have none) and are so patient-centric in their customer service as well as their products. Nothing is worse than wasting hundreds of dollars on crappy MMJ that does nothing for you or makes you feel bad, especially when you're already half broke from a bunch of other medical expenses -- or just life expenses in general."
