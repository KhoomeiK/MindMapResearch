I don‚Äôt have the tolerance I had then, so when I do smoke, I try to keep it down to one or two grams a week. When I worked at a law firm I smoked a little before and after work but never ever in between. I do agree with the current movement in employment law that what you do after hours is your business but I do agree that a client would be uncomfortable if they found out their defense was toking. I tried to smoke way more and at my college level last winter, my writing was still good, i got published with a former White House aide twice, but my days were a little too fuzzy to my liking. I do think you should pay attention to your limits. My memory is sharp, I‚Äôm way more analytical after smoking, picking at every little thing. I don‚Äôt think it was good to smoke and study. I think just a little for motivation to get started is okay, but not copious amounts during a sesh. You can‚Äôt smoke that much during the test so why smoke that much while studying.
