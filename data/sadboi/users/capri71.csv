This question comes up more than any other on this sub.

My advice is the following:

1. Get on the Amazon free tier and create EC2 instance, S3 buckets, etc. Then delete and terminate them so you don't get charged. Get familiar with AWS.
2. Go to Udemy and get Stephane Maarek's SAA course. It should be really cheap.
3. Also get Jon Bonso's practice exams from Udemy. If the price is more than $20, sign up with a different email address and it'll be cheap again.

How much time you allocate is up to you. I took one hour a day for about 2 months. I work in IT but didn't know anything about AWS. However, the course makes it easy to learn.

I think my advice is sound as I already have SAA and Sysops.
