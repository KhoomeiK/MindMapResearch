You have a couple of options here. If you're feeling overwhelmed, set a series of small goals that will get you pointed in the right direction.

Once you have a big goal in mind, ask yourself what it will do for you. Depending on what your goal is, how will achieving that goal help you professionally/emotionally/physically/intellectually/personally?

Once you have that outlined, figure out what you are in relation to that goal, and what options you have to achieve it?

If it's a goal you've had in the past, l what obstacle did you encounter that prevented you, and what foreseeable obstacles do you see?

Once you map all of that out, determine your first steps and make a commitment, and keep in mind those reasons you came up with regarding why you're doing this goal in the first place.

Lastly, find someone who will support you with your goal. If you need a little morale boost here or there, feel free to reply. If you're looking for some fun encouragement,  r/congratslikeimfive might be a good place to stop by.

coolguides,f0fuj7e,t1_f0fexsg,1568589344.0,"I don't know any good ones, but I can try to give you an example. Let's say you have a spreadsheet with two tabs. One tab has a Customer ID number, First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email Address. The second tab has Customer ID, First Name, Last Name, Address, Birthday. I put Customer ID in the far left column because it's distinct and shows up on both tabs.

Let's say on the first tab you want to add the birthday to the the column after email address (column F), you would use the vlookup function to search vertically on the second tab for a matching customer id #, then when it finds a match look further down the row to find the birthday, and put that on your first tab.

With vlookup, you have have the the value you're searching (in this case customer id) in the far left column because that's where it searches. Also, vlookup makes you tell it what column to return a value from. In this case, Birthday is the fifth column.

Let's say you're on cell F6 on the first tab (the one right next to the email address), your formula would look something like this:

=vlookup(A1,(second tab columns A-F),5,False)

This tells Excel to take the value of A1, then go look on the second tab's columns A through F, then when it finds it, go down that row until it gets to the fifth column, and bring that value back to put in first tab's F6 cell. The false is so it brings back an extract match, but I'll ding this by memory so it may be the other way around.

You can always hit F1 and a help menu will pop up any time you get stuck on something.

Good luck."
