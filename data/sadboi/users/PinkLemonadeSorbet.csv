DebateAChristian,fmagel7,t3_ftg4ny,1585893272.0,"I'm no academic, but here's how I see it. Idk if it will help or not but whatevs here goes. 

God created humanity in His image to be loved by Him and to love Him in return. It's only love if it's given freely by choice. So, God must give humanity free will. So, we have the freedom to make good decisions, like to love God - but the reverse has to be true. We also have the freedom to make fallible, stupid, or evil decisions. Creating false doctrines would fall under that. False gods come from humanity, not God. 

As for the omniscience thing, I see it like this:  God sees everything that will ever happen, but for the reasons above, He is not going to necessarily intervene in all of those events, even if they're bad. If someone makes a ""bad"" choice and God prevents them from making it but allows a ""good"" choice, then that doesn't seem like a free and loving God but tyranny, in my personal opinion at least. So rejecting salvation would be a ""bad"" choice that God isn't necessarily going to change when he looks out over the expanse of time because to do so would be to interfere with free will. 

I don't know if that makes any sense. I think of it like say you see everything that's going to happen, ever. And you see that your adult child is going to, say, drive drunk. Of course you're going to plead with your child not to do that, even if you know that they're going to refuse. So you're left with the options of stopping them by force or allowing them to mess up. You respect your child's agency and so you don't forcibly restrain them, but it still breaks your heart that they are making bad decisions. That's kind of how I see God reacting to someone rejecting him. 

I also view it like God is the epitome of everything that is good and makes life worth living, but if one refuses to be reconciled to Him, one can't be with Him for eternity. Hell isn't so much a torture dungeon but an absence of God (everything that's good). Doctrines on Hell vary quite a bit though, so not every Christian believes the fire and brimstone eternal damnation thing. Same with if you were born in a setting that doesn't allow you to hear the Gospel - there's been a LOT of arguing on this point since the church's inception, so there's lots of variation within Christian doctrine on this topic. Many Christians believe that if you don't hear the Gospel, tough titties, it's Hell for you. Many other Christians believe that if you don't hear the Gospel, God provides salvation through other means. 

I don't know if this helped any, this is just how I see it..."

Idk, I was actually thinking of leaving the church over this issue for a while, but I've decided to wait until I can move out and change to a church that, if not affirming, is at least a little more liberal than the church I'm currently at. The people around us play a huge role in how we perceive the world and ourselves.  

One thing that I've found incredibly helpful is Red Letter Christians. There's a book (haven't got around to reading it yet) but the website is super helpful. It doesn't just cover homosexuality, but mostly revolves around how to read and interpret the Bible. There are articles on same-sex relationships though.

Another thing to keep in mind: Abraham had Elizabeth and Hagar. Jacob had Rachel, Leah, and their handmaidens. David, a man after God's own heart, had Michal, Abigail, Bathsheba, and more, I think. If they can be polygamous and be held up as saints (though with Jacob the so-called sainthood is debatable but that's neither here nor there), I think you're probably fine. At the end of the day, our faith doesn't rest on whether or not we're all in heterosexual relationships, it rests on Christ's sacrifice for us: that divine Grace. We're all going to sin in some way or other, but it's our relationship with Christ that saves us all, if that makes any sense? 

Family is difficult. I've found that acceptance is a generational thing. My brother and friends are cool with my bisexuality; my parents are not. You can test the waters with a trusted non-family member in your church, or a family member who you know won't tell anyone else. If your family is as loving as they sound, I'm sure knowing about your preferences won't shake the love they have for you. And sisterly relationships are so much more than who someone loves - I'm sure your cousin will remain close to you. :) That being said, if you don't feel safe or still feel scared, wait. Maybe take a step back from pursuing people, if only so you're not in the anguish you seem to be right now. Maybe find an affirming pastor in your area and meet with them? Idk, but I don't want you to be in this pain, dude. I've been there, and it sucks. 

This stupid sexuality thing is a long road, and I still don't know what side of the debate I'm on. I think I have to figure out some other theological questions before I can get to that, but sometimes I think I've read every article and heard every argument that's ever been made on this subject! It's a process, and God uses it (at least this has been my experience) to bring us closer to Him as we explore, question, and struggle. 

Also, if it's past 2 am where you are, things likely seem worse than they are cause your brain is exhausted! Get some sleep, shove it out of your mind for a while. Things always look better in the morning.

women,eu73c6i,t3_cezwpk,1563516642.0,"I don't know... the concept of having sex with someone solely for money kind of contradicts the concept of enthusiastic consent (because it implies you wouldn't have done it without the incentive of money or, alternatively, the punishment of not having money or food on the table), imo, but I can see possible rebuttals to that argument.

I think porn definitely contributes to the degradation of women though. The lack of oversight in the industry, the awful conditions for workers, the sexism, the catering (for the most part, solely) to the male gaze, the questionable or downright problematic yet still popular genres... There's no getting around the fact that neurons that fire together wire together. Even the most progressive person is going to subconsciously absorb the values of the media they consume, especially if they're having an intense, sexual, emotional interaction with in. When the majority of porn shows women being degraded, dehumanized, or objectified, that's going to affect the viewer's opinion of women. 

Not to mention excessive porn use and/or using porn as a sex tutorial does negatively affect the bedroom, but that's neither here nor there. I've seen disturbing headlines about young people who think that women crying is normal during sex because that's what they see in porn, but I haven't fact checked that. However, anyone can tell you that certain sex acts are on the rise because of increased access and consumption of porn.

Some things that help: 
- get involved. I joined track to make friends, and it helped a lot. Pick something and meet people through it. 

- talk about it with someone. A therapist, parent, mentor - naming the problem is the first step in solving it, and a burden shared is a burden halved. 

- exercise is awesome. Doesn't matter if you're good at it or not. Go out and see what your body can do. 

- remember that high school is by no means a measure of your self worth or even where you'll be in 5 years. It gets better, and imagine how sad it would be if high school was the best part of your life! That's the climax of almost 100 years of living over and done with so soon! Trust me, the best years are on their way. 

- there are apps to meet people and make friends too.

changemyview,eswrzi5,t3_c9a7hy,1562319716.0,"Going to be a freshman at a school like that this fall. I picked the school because it was smaller than public schools (I had a panic attack touring my local university because it was so huge). It's incredibly difficult to find a public school with fewer than 10,000 undergrad, especially if I want a school with a good nursing program in a location I won't absolutely hate. Other pluses: being private allowed the school to be religious, and since the student body as a whole isn't super big, class sizes are smaller so students get more one on one time with professors. 

My family is middle class. We're paying less than 2,000 dollars per year for me to attend because of various scholarships and grants. If you know you can bring the price down, there's definitely something to be said for considering things like location, size, and school culture. Yeah I want a degree, but I want to obtain it while living somewhere I know I can thrive, and a school with tens of thousands of undergraduate students isn't somewhere I can do that."

OpenChristian,eoh74ch,t3_brmtzb,1558574460.0,"Idk if this helps any, but in regards to the ""why would a good God allow suffering"" question here's how I see it: 

God made us. He wanted nothing more than to be in community with us and have a loving relationship with us. However, that is impossible unless we choose it; if we were just mindless drones being told to love God it wouldn't be a genuine relationship. So, God must allow humans free will. That's why in the garden of Eden he said not to eat the forbidden fruit, but didn't guard it with fire and brimstone and whatnot - Adam and Eve were given a choice, to choose God or to choose sin. 

Of course, God knew they would choose to eat the forbidden fruit, but He loved and continues to love his creation enough to allow us to choose each day whether we choose him and righteousness or not. 

Here's where things get tricky: in order to allow for free will, in order for our love to be real, we have to be allowed the consequences of our actions. If we were allowed to choose to kill but not allowed to carry through with it, the choice to commit murder, while an awful one, wouldn't truly exist. If we are denied the full weight of the consequences of our actions then to some extent we are denied our ability to freely choose which actions we take. This is why good people are hurt by bad people - that hurt is a consequence of a freely chosen action. Disasters caused by negligence - still a consequence of a freely chosen action. I don't really have a great answer for things like disease, but I believe that when Adam and Eve took the forbidden fruit, that was a choice to let sin into all of creation, and that effected all of reality down to the molecular level. Therefore, disease is a consequence of the first humans' freely chosen decision to disobey God. 

God loved us enough to give us free will so we could truly love Him, and he loved us enough to send Jesus to atone for the sins of all humanity, for all time, redeeming all of creation from sin, but that's a whole other bucket of worms and this is long enough already. 

This got really lengthy and I'm still struggling with a lot of the questions you posed (e.g. why would a loving God condone the genocide of the Canaanites? A common answer I get is that because all sin and any sin makes us worthy of death, even one impure thought, they deserved death and the only reason God stuck with the Israelites was because they were his way or reaching a world that wasn't ready for the New Covenant. I don't buy that, as there must have been children so young they could never have committed any sin among all those peoples, but I digress). I'm sorry if I'm sounding preachy or anything, this is just what I believe and the answer I found to one of your questions so I thought I'd share. Faith is a lifelong journey, and just because you're struggling with doubts doesn't make your faith less real. Sometimes, the way God draws us closer is through our questioning. Besides, your questions are a good thing! I'd be concerned If you adopted a faith without mulling these queries over."
RadicalChristianity,eoh581y,t3_brasyi,1558573165.0,"I'm praying for you dude. Also there's no such thing as a good Christian; we're all just as messed up as the rest of the world. The difference is we turn to Christ. 

This life is hard. Christ promised no less. But he is there in our weakness and suffering. You can scream and curse and cry with or at him and he can deal with it. He is bigger than this and can handle your perfectly understandable frustration, anger, and doubts. 

I don't know if any of this was helpful or if it all just came across as the most condescending thing ever - I guess what I'm trying to say is don't feel bad for struggling with loving your enemies, trusting God, answering your doubts and questions, etc. God can handle all of it and more. I'm praying for you buddy."
