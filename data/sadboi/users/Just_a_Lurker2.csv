Now, he had compelled someone to believe something they otherwise wouldn't have, in a desperate of... what? Boredom? Frustration? Just a malfunctioning moral compass? A test?

WritingPrompts,fmehnl3,t3_fu6qx8,1586004235.0,"When Arzak woke up, it was to the sound of two little boys, crying. He went outside and thats when he saw them; two small boys, with brown hair and ragged clothes, bound to a rock rolled towards his lair. When they saw him, they promptly stopped, closed their eyes and started trembling. Their breathing sped up, and he could practically smell the pangs of fear.He paused and thought for a minute. He wasn't feeling particularly hungry, actually. Once he thought some more, he realized he might like company.

While he had picked something up on his travels, he could also use the opportunity to learn Humanese and practice.

'Sh,' he tried, the words unfamiliar on his lips. 'It's ok.'That's what people told small kids when they cried or were scared, wasn't it? And later, some had said it to themselves when scared. Usually of him. They also screamed things, but he hadn't found out what 'please don't kill me pleasepleaseplease,' meant, exactly.'It's ok,' he repeated, a purring rumbling in his chest. That was what *dragons* used to soothe kids. The two identical looking boys opened their eyes and said something.

'Please let us go,' one said.

'Let go?' Arzak repeated, confused. The boy nodded frantically and began trashing against the ropes. Oh, he wanted to be unbound! He could do that. Carefully, he cut the ropes with a claw. One of them set out to run. He didn't want them to go!

'Stay,' he barked in a perfect imitation of a man on a village square three villages ago. The dog he had used it on had stayed. So did these boys. The one who almost started to run turned around looking... the dragon sniffed. Surprised.

'Please,' Arzak added, guessing that this conveyed that he wanted it very much. It seemed to work, as they approached him and stared.

A few weeks later saw them together, practicing.

'Thank you?' the dragon repeated after Carolius.

&#x200B;

'That's right,' Carolius confirmed. 'Now, do you know this one?' he held up a drawing with the word under it.

'Tab-le,' Arzak replied.'No, table,' Carolius corrected. 'One word.''Table.'

&#x200B;

And so on. They started telling him stories, explaining different words along the way.

'Changeling?''Child of the Fair Folk,' Karl said'What are Fair Folk?''What does  Fair Folk mean,' Carolius said. 'And they are...' he looked at his brother, lost at how to explain it. 'They kidnap children and replace them with their own. The village believes we are changelings.'

&#x200B;

They didn't say anything more, not that day. But slowly, things slipped out. Things like 'my da used to beat us for this.' and 'this is almost like sleeping on the street.' (on why they needed beds). The dragon demanded wood and food of the village, lots of it, and they gave it to him without guessing why he needed them. Later, he demanded two virgins. Carolius and Karl had a stern talk with him after that, explaining that they could find their own girls just fine, thank you very much. He retracted his demands and they explained to the girls that Arzak was really sorry, he hadn't quite realized... and so on. The girls forgave it. Eventually."

WritingPrompts,flqiz54,t3_fqbwmz,1585396643.0,"I met one of the Old Ones today. He was green and blue, and chattered nonstop. 

It happened in a cave near the mountain I climbed in. The first thing I saw, was a large, reptilian head. I very nearly stumbled back, of course, but somehow I felt a prodding and fell in. 

'Come in, come in, let me make you a cup of tea. This must be quite a shock for you,' a friendly voice said. The dragon send a puff of flames in the direction of a small iron kettle, which began to sing immediately. 'Ouch,' the voice muttered, which I now connected to the dragon, apparently at the sound. 'Sorry, dragon hearing. Would you mind pouring, dear? Herbs are over there.' It gestured dismissively. 'We haven't made our own kettles yet, see.' 

The kettle was clearly looted from a nearby village -I recognized the stamp of the maker- and seemed to sit in a place of honor among several other human artifacts; kitchen knifes, pans, jewelry (carefully laid apart, often half-melted), and several non-damaged books and paintings.  It appeared to be one of the few things the dragon had figured out how to use. On a nearby 'shelf' (a ridge in the rock big enough to put things on) were recognizable tea-herbs and several that seemed quite undrinkable. 

'I saw what herbs you humans collect,' the dragon explained. 'And decided to try them all!'

He - or she, I honestly wasn't sure- sounded as excited as a puppy. 

'Go on, choose one!' it encouraged me. 'I've seen you do it at a local picnic. You cook them! I never thought of it. No wonder plants always seemed so dry!'

'You have... observed us?' 

'Yes I did. Even found a couple of recipes, only I never managed to identify the herbs.'

'This,' I said, pointing to chamomile. 'Is chamomile. It is often used as tea for the ill. *That* is arsenic,' I said, pointing to another. 'It is never to be used under any circumstances. It is poisonous.'

'Shame,' said the dragon. 'I liked the aftertaste.' 

'Mistletoe,' I continued. 'Is only to be used as a decoration, and then only around Midwinter. As is Holly. Sage is often dried to burn, for removal of evil. Mint is a tea-herb.'

I carefully put it near chamomile and nettle and put in lemon balm in two scorched cups, which reminded me uncomfortably of the fact I was lecturing a *dragon*. 

The dragon seemed to *observe* me with its amber eyes, as I shut up and stacked a couple of books to sit on. The dragon sat too, on its hind legs. 

'Most dragons are so busy hoarding gold or books nobody gets around to visiting me,' it said at last. 'They think I talk too much.'

'In my village they think I talk too little,' I admitted. 

'Most sleep now,' the dragon rumbled. 'When they awaken they plan on eating the earth, and the moon, and the sun.'"

And I can focus, but I cant force focus so I can really only focus on, you guessed it, writing. Plus, a depressing lack of skills that would result in a job."

writing,fl3irnw,t3_fm9p2s,1584785913.0,"Another piece of advice: read outside your own genre. From that you can learn new things you can apply to your own genre.
Like if you write fantasy, try getting into myths. Or hard sci-fi, bc that can be *very* useful to learn how to describe hard magic systems. Just read anything you want to read outside the genre you write in, I'd say."

HPfanfiction,fkq89i6,t1_fkphz8l,1584434805.0,"Fanfics are unfair to everyone. Every trait that gets seen as 'bad' gets dialed up to eleven. Suddenly Dumbledore is a manipulative pedo, the Dursley's raped Harry, Hermione is a narrowminded bitch who abuses Ron, who is secretly dosing Harry with potions so he stays loyal to the Weasley's bc Dumbledore pays him to do that, and also hits Hermione when the food isn't on the table when he gets home, Snape provides the potions and is secretly evil all along, and also has a crush on Hermione.  This is only a slight exaggeration of tropes surprisingly common in fanfics."

Wait, she was a abuser?"

But she wouldn't stand up too much either. Best case scenario she'd be like Remus Lupin."

HPfanfiction,fko54nq,t3_ffqi81,1584380294.0,"Once upon a time, the four founders each heard a knock on the door. Each reacted differently. Gryffindor, fearing it was Slytherin, drew his want and exploded the door. Amidst the rubble, looking not in the slightest surprised, stood Death. 
'Hello Godric,' he said calmly. 'I thought I'd introduce myself. I am Death, bearer of souls, and in a month I will take you away in whatever manner you think befitting. Since you leave a lot behind, I thought I'd warn you.' 
With that, he left.
Slytherin, when he heard the knock-knock-knock, slipped out of the backdoor, and walked around the house, hoping to catch Gryffindor or whichever founder it was from behind. Death met him halfway, and told him the same thing.
Ravenclaw, who had been out for a bit, was *very* surprised when she came back to a intruder lounging on her couch, scythe nonchalantly placed against the wall, but she kept her cool, as did Hufflepuff later.
'I see you solved my riddle,' see said, amiably enough. 'Would you like a cup of tea?'
'Technically I do not need the sustenance,' he replied. 'But it's a nice gesture all the same.' And he told her, too, that she had but a month to live.
'Well,' she said, after a pause. 'Thank you for informing me.'
Hufflepuf welcomed his visitor as he would any visitor and Death, now quite tired, left him soon.
They all agreed to meet up on neutral territory. All were worried for their legacy. In the end, Slytherin and Ravenclaw came up with a idea; ask if their most loyal followers would sacrifice themselves so part of them could stay. The question was, of course, where and how. Gryffindor came up with the idea to use the hat and selected his first choice; a noble and brave knight. The knight agreed, prefering to die by beheading. They were not very practised at that, so it took some time before he actually died and they could bind him to the castle (in return) and bind a piece of Gryffindor to the hat. 
Ravenclaw and Slytherin chose at the same time. Slytherin told a baron he knew to be particularly volatile and in love with Ravenclaws daughter that Rowena asked him to pass on her request to go find the diadem (for he desired it very much) and the daughter. He also told him that, if he did well, he could die a honourable death for his lord. The baron was willing, and, exactly as Slytherin planned, enraged when the daughter neither returned the love nor the diadem. When he killed her, and saw her beautiful body on the ground in front of him, her pale skin slick with blood, her lips wet and red like roses, he couldn't bear to live with himself. Forgetting completely the agreement Slytherin had made him sign, he killed himself. The most unwilling horcrux yet, forever angry at being stuck in Hogwarts. Ravenclaw knew nothing of this, of course and chose a young maiden and as her location, the door to the dormatry. When the double murder happened, and the baron and the daughter returned, the ritual was already going on. Thus it was that she had two horcruxes. 
Hufflepuf asked a portly friar he knew well, and the friar agreed to it if he, too, could be linked to the castle and keep a eye on the pupils.

Godric died first, in a duel with Slytherin, who died next. Ravenclaw followed soon after; a pile of books crushed her. Hufflepuf died comfortably in front of a fire."
