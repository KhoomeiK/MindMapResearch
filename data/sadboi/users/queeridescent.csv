When I was in high school, my friend was out of state and messaged me kind of out of the blue. They had been struggling with their mental health for a while and I always tried to be there for them as much as I could, even when it was unhealthy for me. Anyway, they sent me a pic of their suicide note, a bloody knife, and an empty pill bottle and stopped responding to messages. I called the local PD but without an exact address they couldn't help. So I tracked down this friend's family on facebook and their sibling was able to call an ambulance. A few minutes later and they wouldn't have made it. So I helped save a life from hundreds of miles away."

asktransgender,fkl9d2v,t3_fj2wm8,1584301345.0,"Using a menstrual cup could help as you don't have to change them often and they can help with cramps; be aware that they are messy and have a big learning curve though.

A hormonal IUD (slow-release birth control that goes in your uterus) will most likely help with cramping and lighten your flow (it stopped my period altogether). The procedure to have it put in is painful and invasive but then you don't have to think about it for 5 years except to check your strings. **EDIT:** just saw how young you are. You can get a smaller version of the IUD but you might not be interested bc of your age. I second others' suggestions to try birth control pills. You can take them straight thru with no bleeding week. 

Beyond those two things, I can only suggest being extra kind to yourself and perhaps trying to do things that make you feel more masc. Put on a binder and your face button up, maybe shave your face even if there's nothing there, wear some cologne and a watch, contour your face and give yourself a five-o-clock shadow, whatever makes you feel more comfortable. Also be sure to keep yourself hydrated and take pain meds as needed. :) Hope this helps and hope you feel better!"

Bisexual - attraction to more than one gender

Pansexual - attraction regardless of gender

I know it's nuanced and if you've not experienced it, it might not make a lot of sense right away, but there is a difference. I call myself pan because I've found that the genders and physical characteristics of the people I'm attracted to don't have any affect on my attraction. I'm not bisexual so I can't speak for that experience.

Biological sex is a spectrum, as are sexuality and gender (did you know you can be born with 2 X chromosomes and fully develop physically as a male?). I advise you to read up on these topics before you continue spreading false and harmful ideas."

I'm certain I'm on the right portion of the spectrum because, in short, I have more in common with trans people than with cis women regarding how I feel about my body and regarding the way I interact with the world. I myself am definitely not gender apathetic; in fact at times I have a very strong sense of gender - it's just not male or female. Those lived experiences affirm that I am indeed trans. I also feel that it's enough that I am averse to the idea of going through life as a woman (or a man, for that matter), though I do have dysphoria. 

As far as what empowers me in regards to my gender... Wearing my jacket with my pronouns stitched on it. Seeing inclusive language being used used (""people with x anatomy"" rather than ""women""). The way I choose to present can be very empowering, especially if I'm making myself stand out a bit - nerve-wracking at times, but empowering nonetheless.

I am non-binary (and pansexual), and similar to the parent comment here, I also don't believe anyone can be completely straight and be attracted to me. If you think I'm hot, then in my mind, you're a bit gay. It's kind of a form of self-validation for me that exists independently of how that person chooses to identify.

That said, my cis male partner IDs as straight. He's always been attracted to women and femininity - I am the exception for him and we both acknowledge that. He continues to ID as cishet, and I am fine with that because it's not my place to define his sexuality. I know that he doesn't see me as a woman, he's incredibly validating and respectful of my trans identity, and I realize that if we were to split that he would almost definitely go back to being with women only. So to me, insisting that he identify as bi or a bit gay or whatever just isn't worth it. 

He is free to define his attraction in a way that makes sense and is comfortable to him, and I'm free to view other people's attraction to me in a way that validates me :)

Also, this is just my own experience. If someone's partner IDing as straight made them feel like their gender was not being taken seriously or if it caused any dysphoria, that would be completely valid - I'm not trying to prescribe what works for me for anyone else."

Bottom growth stayed the same, no changes once I stopped. My face is still more masc than it was at my starting point but did soften back up once I stopped. I still grow all the same body hair, but it softened and thinned a bit once I stopped. Fat redistribution went back to the way it was pre-t. Lost the extra muscle mass I had gained. Body odor, sex drive, acne, and skin texture all went back to how they were pre-t. Oh and I'm pretty sure I gained like half a shoe size, and that went back down once I stopped. I think that's everything lol"
NonBinary,ff6enmm,t1_ff5zipq,1579625546.0,"I was on 20mg/week, injected intramuscularly. I first started noticing the hair on my hands and arms getting darker. My legs also got hairier and I have the hints of a happy trail now, with like 3 darker, thicker hairs in there. I have the faint beginnings of a mustache - the hair on the outer edges of my upper lip is dark enough that I shave it once or twice a week. Also, my lower back and ass got a *bit* hairier and my pubic hair started to expand from a triangle area onto my inner thighs. Most of the hair seems to be existing hair that got darker, with the exception of my tummy hair and pubic hair."

asktransgender,ff34hmd,t1_ff2a8jp,1579533455.0,"See my most recent comment for his response. I have also written this man before and gotten a good response from him. Perhaps I am the exception, but no one can know for sure how their lawmakers will respond until they try to write."
asktransgender,ff34av0,t3_er2ssr,1579533320.0,"Thank you for the feedback everyone, I'll keep it in mind should I write again.

I've already gotten a response from my senator:

>Thank you for writing. Because of privacy filing requirements, the public sees the bills authored by other Senators or Representatives the same the elected officials see them. After receiving your email, I read the entirety of SB1819.  It is problematic on several levels. The bill now will be assigned to a committee as all bills are assigned. It will be up to the committee chair to decide to hear or not hear the bill. I do not think this bill will move forward, however, it is not my decision. Please know that if the bill does move forward, I will certainly do all in my power to protect the rights of all people in Oklahoma.

About the best I can get right now, I think."

asktransgender,fehlu53,t1_feeqe0y,1579119167.0,Am I correct in thinking that there is still not gender neutral option?
exchristian,feeprgg,t3_eocjee,1579038641.0,"Oh, OP, I can completely relate to this. I'm still trying to navigate things with my own parents. (Mainly my mom - my dad is kind of an asshole so we don't talk anymore.) 

For me, personally, I have definitely drifted away from my parents over the past couple years. It's been incredibly painful at times, but overall I think it's the best thing for me. Why should I put in so much emotional energy into having a relationship with my parents if they can't fulfill their most basic parental obligations of unconditional love and acceptance? So for now I am just playing things by ear. 

My advice to you is to figure out what you want/need from your parents. Is it feasible that you can have that? If yes, work towards that. If no, well, it's up to you how big of a deal it is that you don't get what you need.

Good luck, OP. Keep us posted."
