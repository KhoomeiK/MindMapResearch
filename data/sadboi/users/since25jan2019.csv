To prevent my warm respiration from condensing and freezing on my ceiling, I suspended a tarp over the whole area with magnets. This created a pocket of air between the tarp and ceiling which didn't mix with my respiration at all. Instead, my warm breath spread out under the tarp and dissipated its heat energy gradually. The most I ever got was a light sheen of frost on the tarp.

In the summertime, this same pocket of air retarded the heat transfer from the hot metal body to my van interior, by preventing the hot air just inside the body from mixing with the air below.

Also, under clear skies, when the atmospheric ceiling is 10,000m, the temperature gradient (say, 35C in summer) will suck heat out of the roof, cooling the van interior shortly after sundown, even if the ground level ambient temperature is still 35C.

You can use the same principle in winter to stay warm. Don't park under a clear sky in the wintertime, even if it's not that cold at ground level. Instead find a tree (even with bare branches) to park under. This will render your ""ceiling"" a few meters above your vehicle at most, and the temperature gradient will be almost nothing, so your heat loss will be very gradual."
