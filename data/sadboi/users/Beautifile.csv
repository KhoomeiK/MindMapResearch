Just a story I just thought of, one time my husband & I were walking from our car to the park & a group of guys pulled up in a car drunk and one got out & was going to try to fight my husband. My husband had no idea it was going on until I told him later because I got between the guy & him & started talking a million miles a minute to the guy to confuse him. It worked & his friends got him back into the car, but I later had to explain the whole thing to my husband because he was cluless. I'm from the city, he's from the country in Ireland. When I asked my dad about it he said the guy was just trying to show his friends how tough he was fighting a huge 6'4 guy. One of the odder things that's happened to me innocently walking down the street.
Don't let this scare you though. It only happened because my husband is a giant."

No eyeshadow is supposed to involve this much work, be it pressed pigments (I have tons of loose pigments that I make into pressed pigments and they work just fine, mostly MAC) or everyday eyeshadow.

depression,fr3mjrs,t3_gm5q62,1589860747.0,"Please don't think these thoughts are in any way unusual. I've often thought of things such as ""If I were in a bank being robbed I would volunteer to be the sole hostage"" and other such thoughts. It's really hard for people w/ depression to value their lives as much as the lives of others, but then you just have to set up mental boundries for your thoughts such as ""Would I give my life for a 96 year old?"" The answer should be ""No."" Would I give my life for a child, any child, the answer for not only depressives but most people of a certain age should be ""Yes."" However, only the depressives would line up to volunteer!  

I go on because a lot of people rely on me, as insane as I am. My best friend has an absolutely horrible life in my book, so I have to live to call her every day & make her laugh. My father has no one but me. He's an asshole who has alienated all his friends and all his family is dead except me and my evil sister. So I've got to go one for that. 

You only need ONE reason to go on & if you can't find one, my best advice as a 47 year old who was told she wouldn't live to see 27 is: Join a charity. You'll feel needed and have a sense of purpose, I swear. I'm not in great shape and am quarrantined w/an abusive, alcoholic husband, but I've started a COVID charity & it's made all the difference.

Friends,

 

July 4 was yesterday, so today is July's first Thursday, that means next Thursday, July 11, is Big Apple Pen Club meeting night!   

 

As usual, we will meet from 7-9 at Bard Hall, just west of Columbus Circle.  Bring your pens, bring your inks, bring your paper, bring your supper if you want...  Directions to Bard Hall are below. 
Hope to see you next Thursday evening! 

Tim
Directions:   

Bard Hall, the residential building for Bard Graduate Center, is located at 410 West 58th Street in Manhattan, just west of 9th Avenue/Columbus Avenue.  The best way to get there from almost anywhere in NYC is via subway -- take the 1/A/C/B/D trains to 59th Street/Columbus Circle (note: 2/3 trains do not stop at 59th, even though it is a major intersection). Depending on which subway exit stair you use, put Central Park behind you and walk around the southern (left) side of the Time Warner complex, which is 58th Street. Walk west on 58th (against traffic); 9th Avenue/Columbus is the next intersection west. Bard Hall is diagonally across the intersection and three addresses downhill on 58th at 410, immediately past the small construction site.  Please tell the guard you are there for the Pen Club -- you will be expected and directed to the proper room. Feel free to bring any food and drink with you.

Don't ask me why but as our masks go to hospitals, nursing homes, ambulance corps, etc. I have done my due diligence as many times as they've changed the regulations. This is the latest information, however, just know that I don't trust chiffon nor silk with bleach. I also don't trust machine washing silk on hot as we do with our masks before we send them. I hope this helps. Pass it on."
ptsd,fqgs09s,t3_gi6f3d,1589355211.0,"I think that's possible. I have horrendous nightmares every night & I wake up, brush myself off & go on to have normal days. Two nights ago I was screaming in my sleep because I was about to be gang raped by a bunch of very strong senior citizens. Last night I had a nightmare my favorite aunt tried to molest me as an adult (honestly if she wasn't passed on IDK how I would face her). This is every night. No, I was never molested, but my fear of being raped is greater than my fear of suffering or of death. IDK why. SO yes, I think it's possible to just not give a shit anymore to the horrors. Not to the suffering of others but of your own."

What you are doing is incredibly important and could save thousands the agony of dying alone. When you feel the wind going out of your sails, find the speech by Winston Churchill during WWII that starts with ""Never Give Up, in things Great or Small."" It will re-inflate your sails. 

I've started a charity of my own and personally raised $1000 by begging and swallowing my pride and asking my friends, some of whom I hadn't seen in 5 years, for donations. It took a lot for me to do that but my charity makes masks and splash guards for hospitals, nursing homes, ambulance corps, etc. I didn't take a day off for the first 2 1/2 months & worked from breakfast until the wee hours on it. And in my opinion I STILL haven't done enough because November is coming faster than anyone realizes and then we'll have at least two strains of the flu and COVID to deal with. And my charity is out of funds and I'm out of ingenuity of how to obtain funds. I feel I could do more, be better, but I'm just one person running this alone.

These thoughts must cross your mind as well but take a step back and look again: I personally may have saved lives. I personally raised $1000 against all odds. I'm doing SO much more than the average person... AND SO ARE YOU! You are a unique individual that cares enough to attempt this.

You've got this! You're intelligent and caring and everything you need to accomplish this. But it's going to take a lot out of you and many times you'll wonder why you even started and YES you are going to have to scream from the rooftops to get people to listen, but I've got a good feeling you can do this. I'm rooting for you! Good Luck!"

You would be on a much higher dose but just keep in mind if you go to a General Practitioner or the like the hormones they give you will be artificial and your body will have to work to assimilate them. Not so w/ biologically identical ones. When I was looking for a doctor near me there was a free service that listed all of the B.I.H. doctors in my area.

MakeupRehab,fqgj9ll,t3_gig5az,1589347746.0,"Can I give you some advice as a 47 year old who shops too much? #1 DO NOT take up sewing of all things. There are literally countless things one can buy for sewing in the name of ""needing it"". I know because I've got a sewing desk & table in my bedroom and haven't sewn in over 2 years. As a matter of fact I now have a semi-phobia that I'll break my machine if I sew. I have SO many ""notions"" as they are called. I also was collecting fabric, but two years ago gave a ton away & kept some in the closet in space bags which brings me to point #2 Join or start a charity. I've started a COVID charity that takes up most of my time and only today because I found $90 in a cashback site account did I allow myself to buy something. We make masks & splash guards for hospitals, nursing homes, ambulance corps, etc. You need to account for every penny donated even if it's just to yourself. 

But honestly, tonight I ""decided"" that the masks had to match & put about $150 worth of fabric in my cart.  But it's just sitting there. The reason I say ""start"" a charity is because you'll have to be the mouthpiece & get donations, however small, then you'll really find out how to both stretch a dollar & literally how much difference $1 can make. We can make 1 splash guard with a dollar- to the cent. That's how I measure money now. Also, don't think it's too late, my volunteers are currently making things that hospitals will need in November. Every doctor and virologist I've listened to says if we think this is bad, wait until November when we've got both the regular yearly flus + COVID again. Not to scare you, just saying. If you want help, I'm here for you. You're braver than you think!"

My father & sister just put my mother into a nursing home last week (yes, during a pandemic) & I think you could get nursing homes to sponsor you, according to how much you plan on charging. Why are you charging, BTW? What would your expenses actually be that you would get money then subsequently donate it? I'm assuming it's not to support yourself, right? I'm not trying to be a smart ass I'm just trying to understand so I can help you better. I will warn you that charity efforts take more out of you than you could ever dream when you're the one running them. I am running a small charity under the auspices of a larger non-profit. We make masks and splash guards for three local hospitals. We would never have been able to find the contacts we did if it hadn't been for that non-profit. That might be the best place to start- contact a local non-profit to help you reach out to their sponsoring contacts.  It made all the difference for our group.  Hope this helps.

If you could get a national chain like that to sponsor the coupons (which they send you in the mail anyway) people would do it because they'd feel like they're getting paid but you would be getting them for free. Technically I know I'm doing their activities for something that comes in the mail anyway, but when I use them I feel like all my time was worth it. Just a thought.

depression,fpcj83h,t1_fpchm0v,1588502571.0,"I don't like the fact that (even if my perception is off) I feel I'm being lied to. If you are lonely, I've put myself out there for you, which in and of itself is no small feat. If I'm taking 99 steps and you only have to take 1 to reach me, take the helping hand I'm offering. It also makes me wonder who is simply doing it for misguided attention? When I was about 13, 14 I thought it was ""cool"" to be depressed because all the bands I listened to sang about being depressed, it must be cool. Then one of my friends tried to kill herself by taking a bottle of Tylenol. To make matters worse, she later told me she was on the phone w/ me when she did it which I totally didn't need to know. Needless to say, we didn't stay friends for long. But in a way I don't feel bad when I think about her because one day after we had both graduated college & I was interviewing, I was on my way to an interview looking the best I could to impress, & I notice the person across from me is like practically dancing w/ the top half of her body to her headphones. I immediately thought ""Attention Whore"". Anyway the person gets up and faces me and it's her and she says ""Hillary, OMG!"" I calmly say ""Hello"" She says ""It's Robin"" I say ""I know"" She says""How are you?"" I say ""Good"" then the train doors close on her. I made it clear I was in no way happy or excited to see her & I felt vindicated in some small way because she expected me to be excited.
Sorry for the long story. I'm a talker as you've already guessed which makes it even harder for me to put myself out there for these people who say they're going to kill themselves & then don't even reply ""I'm Okay"" or Don't worry"" Anything. You've obviously experienced it too. I'm taking a break from this site after tonight. It's too draining to worry about all these people threatening to commit suicide. I hope you have a wonderful day.
