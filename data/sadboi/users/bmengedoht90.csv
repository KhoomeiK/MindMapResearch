dating_advice,flbvyab,t3_fnmfvt,1585013872.0,"Is there any appropriate way to approach someone in the gym..?
 I'm a female and there's this guy I've been crushing on for 3 years. Lately we keep making eye contact and he always seems to move in my vicinity where ever I'm lifting in the gym. Would it be lame to have have my number written down on a piece of paper with, ""hey you should text me some time."" Fold it up and say hey, I think you dropped something then walk away..?ðŸ˜‚"
confidence,flbte6z,t1_flbhdde,1585012179.0,Ahh this is such a great idea! Something I really struggle with while talking to people I don't know well is how smart or dumb I sound/ how they're judging me. I feel like this could really help.
selfimprovement,fjm9jo0,t3_fdtl0k,1583464801.0,I resonate so much with this! Booked my first solo hiking trip to Southern Utah. I leave in a month and I'm so nervous I'll be bored/ lonely and too distracted by all of the other groups and families to really enjoy my time.
selfimprovement,fjm7scv,t1_fjl7b52,1583463593.0,Aww I loved reading this. Congrats on all of your progress you've made! It's inspiring
Anxiety,fj2mbtc,t3_faz1uo,1582947419.0,Does anybody have to write down what they're going to say before they make that dreaded phone call? I don't know what the hell my problem is but I've always had to do this when handling serious phone calls or work calls
confidence,fism9on,t3_f9fa0n,1582687718.0,"Think of it as exciting to meet a new person, you could even make a new friend from it. If anything, it could be such a great encounter that it puts a smile on your face-and theirs! Just know that most people are WAY too self-absorbed/ pre-occupied to be caring how you said something, judging the encounter for awkwardness, etc. And most people have been super open to me asking them a question/starting a conversation."
Mindfulness,fi95era,t3_f72thz,1582255999.0,I so needed to read this. It's exactly what I've been going through so thank you for explaining this!
LifeProTips,fhph3zn,t3_f44e52,1581789477.0,Does this same idea apply to dogs? I'm going to try it .. my dog is not cuddly enough lol
Mindfulness,fghhnaa,t1_fg7nycc,1580785026.0,"Yes! Also, people watching is my absolute favorite but I almost feel like a creep doing it sometimes ðŸ˜‚"
Mindfulness,fg6qzjv,t3_ex51zk,1580574874.0,"After I started meditating for a while, I noticed that when I'm out and about that I have a tendency to stare at everything around me with a sense of wonder and almost get stuck in a trance sometimes...does this happen to anyone else?"
infp,ffwej1c,t1_ff28tz2,1580297953.0,Thank you so much! I will keep that in mind for sure
Anxiety,ffwefyn,t1_ffge1x7,1580297850.0,"I find it so rewarding and humbling. This patient population are often homeless and have no family so they're so appreciative of everything. I have so much compassion for them. Just the times when a patient escalates I really seem to struggle with how to respond. It can also be draining dealing with the patients with personality disorders like borderline, narcissists, etc. But overall, it is super interesting and there is never a full moment working in it haha"
Anxiety,fff8ew5,t3_et1xah,1579878291.0,"YES. This is me. I literally freeze from being so anxious and triggered by yelling, even if it's not directed at me. AND I work in psych so I'm exposed to somewhat frequently- it hasn't gotten any easier. I'm thinking the specialty may not be for me just for that reason ðŸ˜£"
infp,ff1zpe8,t1_ff1pyyu,1579489968.0,"I needed to read this, as I have been considering starting meds for depression but instead I am gonna do the work on myself that needs to be done! Before I try and go the medication route. So journaling and counseling it is. So thank you"
infp,feccgph,t3_eo6mvn,1578970702.0,I'm a psych nurse. Burned out though and it's too close to home (my dad has a mental illness) so I'm avidly trying to figure out what else to do
confidence,fcpupj6,t3_ei5e30,1577872528.0,"Thank you for this list. Another thing worth mentioning is, positive affirmations! Has helped me a ton. Some that have helped build self-love and also confidence are: ""if God is for me, who can be against me."" Also, ""I deeply and completely love and accept myself."" 
""I have all the skills I need to be successful."" 
""I am worthy of love and being loved.""
Say them before bed, when you're in the shower, any where you have a free moment!"
confidence,fcpu732,t1_fcnsde3,1577872217.0,I already do this any way because why not? No pants party all day every day haha
infp,fbt0ccc,t3_eebvdz,1577064943.0,"This has sooo been my situation too. I feel like I have such substantial,wholesome conversations with older people.. I'm 29 and have really been clicking with people who are in their 50's-60's. Maybe we were born in the wrong generation?!"

Mindfulness,f81cn98,t3_dxew1g,1574161910.0,"You kind of just try a bunch of different methods and see which one works for you and keep doing it. For me, exercising 30 to 45 minutes a day- weight lifting has been great for stress/ anxiety relief.
-complete a whole 30- which is essentially an elimination diet to figure out which foods you might be reacting to and causing your anxiety and other ailments. For me, I discovered dairy and gluten are the source of a lot of my anxiety, irritability, and depression and feeling so much better when I don't eat them. So essentially eating a paleo diet
-meditating 10 to 15 minutes a day with the headspace app
-take up hiking or just being outside in nature
-**CBD/ hemp seeds oil has been super effective and is something I started implementing recently. Good luck!!"
Mindfulness,f81bj1o,t3_dyc6n7,1574160269.0,"This is literally the same thing that happens to me! Sometimes if I really focus on my breath, where it is in my body and then thinking of waves of an ocean going in and out with the sound of the exhale (mouth is closed the whole time- you're breathing through your nose). That a lot of times helps me. Maybe try that?"
infp,f6z7ggs,t3_dtd3sn,1573311260.0,"I'm a psych nurse and just recently found out I am an infp. I'm burned out working with patients because I overly empathize with them on one hand, but also fed up/ drained by dealing with the drug addicts and personality disorders some of these people have. If I'm not mistaken, we INFPs tend to be mediators, so I've been really struggling with having to set limits and verbally de-escalate volatile patients when all I really want to do is keep the peace and avoid confrontation"
INFP_Success,f6g66tf,t3_bvnm8a,1572822282.0,Im a psych nurse but feeling so burned out. It gets old being verbally attacked and having to de-escalate agitated patients all the time so I'm avidly trying to find another field that doesn't involve patient care
INFP_Success,f6g5f5p,t1_eyti9w0,1572822081.0,I work in psych as a nurse! Good luck
infp,f6fw2gc,t3_dr6cne,1572818725.0,"I could not agree more with this. Feeling especially overstimulated as I'm leaving NYC for the weekend;  everyone being on their phones, being sure to document/ take pictures of EVERYTHING in every moment that they hardly live in the moment. You know it's for the gram. It's all so fake. Meanwhile, I'm sitting here trying to be in the moment, take it all in, but the phones are so distracting. It's depressing to watch. I'm so glad I found this group. Okay vent over, thanks for reading"
