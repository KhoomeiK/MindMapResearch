I have learned to be patient with relationships, so that's been different. Narcs let the mask slip eventually, so if I start as friends with them they eventually show they only care about themselves. Instead of throwing myself into a relationship, I've been a lot more guarded. I kinda feel like I've almost gone too far to the other side now, to the point of being avoidant.

It takes time and practice. You're having to unlearn a major habit, and those don't get broken quickly. Be sure to be patient with yourself, and ask the people around you to be patient too.

Now that I don’t have that relationship to worry about, I can focus on what I want rather than what I think god wants. 

I still have trouble sleeping. And really terrible nightmares too. It’s helpful to remind myself that they’re just nightmares. There’s a lot of things that I can’t control and sometimes I get a perfectionistic need to try and control things around me. But that isn’t how life is supposed to work. Learning how to let go of the control was one of the best things I ever did for myself, and has made a monumental difference in my mental health.

Ultimately, it's your life. Do what you want, you are in charge of your own happiness. Everything I've read so far has been bad news in my opinion. Someone who tells you that they're going to hurt themselves and it's your fault is %100 abusive. It's not. You don't control their actions, but you do control your own.

Life can be rough, and it's better to have a team-mate on your side when shit hits the fan. She doesn't sound like she's on your side, but expects you to be on hers. If you don't feel better when she's around, I'd move on.  I don't ever want to diminish anyone's trauma, but if she's unwilling to help you with yours like you're helping her, you need to cut the cord. 

I'm just an internet stranger, but there's too many parallels for me to ignore what you've been saying.

There’s a heavy culture of judgement and elitism within Mormonism and a crazy amount of gossiping. The history is full of really horrifying things, polygamy, polyandry, sexism, racism and straight up murder. All of these things are written out of Mormon teachings and ridiculously whitewashed. 

They prime children from a young age to be completely obedient. It’s a culture that promotes rampant emotional and physical abuse. Many of my friends have grown up with abuse that they should never have had to endure, and I think that blame rests squarely on this environment. There’s a man named Sam Young who is currently fighting hard to give Mormon children more safeguards and protection in church, and he got kicked out of the religion because of it. 

My sister and I have been disowned by my parents because my sister came out to them and I stood with her. A lot of Mormons HATE the LGBTQ+ community, my Mormon family have openly stated that anyone gay should be sequestered away from them because “muh family values.” I have younger siblings that I’m not going to be able to see until they’re adults. Obviously I find the family values sentiment more than a little ironic. 

You get “callings” which are basically unpaid part-time clergy jobs. Everyone has a home teacher and/or visiting teacher who’s job is to come over and make sure you’re doing enough churchy stuff. It’s very Orwellian, 1984ish. Big brother is always watching and if you don’t do it right you won’t get into VIP heaven(Mormons call it the “celestial kingdom)
