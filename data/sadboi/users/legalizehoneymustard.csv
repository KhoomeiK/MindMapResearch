BipolarReddit,fmv155d,t1_fmuduoh,1586403522.0,I second this. There should be a bipolar PhD student group or something!
BipolarReddit,fmv115f,t3_fx4b6i,1586403447.0,"Congratulations!! I am a third year computer science PhD student with bipolar II. It's... hard, as you already know. I went right into the PhD after my master's and right into that after undergrad. I think it's smart of you (whether you planned the break or not) that you got a better hold of your symptoms and found meds that work for you. In my case, I was diagnosed almost a year ago at the end of my second year in the PhD. Still not totally stable, but I'm working on it.

I second the comments saying to register with disability support at your university. I'd say do it as soon as possible, even if you think you won't need them. I didn't do it until a month ago, and I could have used some support a while ago. It's great to have people advocating for you at your school.

Again, I'm really proud of you! Life with BP isn't easy, and neither is a PhD. It has its ups and downs but research can be super rewarding. Feel free to message me if you want to!"

bipolar2,fgl1df9,t1_fgkb5zp,1580879014.0,"yes, i think motivation is a big part of this. i do frequently experience motivation problems when depressed, and i guess i wasn't so clear when i said ""give up before even starting."" what i had in my head was more what comes *after* the first stake is in the ground. i do the first little bit of work. i look out into the imagined future of having this work completely done, but that future seems pointless and boring and, therefore it is useless for me to do the rest of the work. but then again, maybe this is just another framing of lack of motivation."

bipolar2,erdm2f4,t3_c1fbqm,1560746902.0,Seroquel saved my life and dug me out of a bad depressive episode on only 50mg.
bipolar2,erb3p6j,t1_eqenobk,1560660606.0,I think quetiapine saved my life.
bipolar2,eqeoy4k,t1_eqenobk,1560007268.0,I'm not sure yet. I've only taken it for three days but it is helping so far.
bipolar2,eqej4qg,t3_by8fm1,1560004613.0,"That happened to me too when I started on 2 mg!! Then I went up to 4 mg, but am now in a horrible depressive episode so we switched to quetiapine for now."
bipolar,eqalk5x,t3_bxy3sq,1559935305.0,"I am taking it now along with quetiapine and it helps my anxiety but does not help at all for my depression or hypomania. I had no side effects from it, but also no good effects from it either."
bipolar2,epynoba,t3_bwmkcr,1559645268.0,"I feel the same. People say it gets better, which I believe. But then it always goes back to being this bad again. It's hard to know if I can ever be ""normal"""

bipolar2,eod35kv,t3_breiyi,1558467783.0,"YES. Ifeel the extreme love for life and people when I'm hypomanic. I NEED to talk to people. I crave it. I feel more talkative and confident and silly for ever having felt depressed. However, I also sleep less during these periods. My thoughts do race and I also feel smarter than others. I get new research ideas and think faster than I normally do."
