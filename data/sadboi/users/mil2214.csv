BPD,fn8oi4r,t3_g084js,1586746335.0,"21M, was diagnosed with bpd at 15, my main strategy for things is mindfulness, i have rapid mood swings so it helps when I'm low cause in about 20 minutes I'll be on the upswing. Anyway, 54321 is my most used skill. If you haven't heard of it, describe to yourself in vivid detail 5 things you see, 4 things you smell, 3 things you hear, 2 things you touch, and 1 thing you taste, by the time you get to the taste you'll be so grounded that you can get a grasp on whatever is happening at the moment. If you haven't tried this give it a shot, if it doesn't work for you Im sorry. If there is anything I can say as someone who's a little older, it doesn't go away, but you will learn how to cope, and you will understand what's going on."
