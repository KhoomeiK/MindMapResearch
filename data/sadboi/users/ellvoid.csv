My experience with it has mostly been on the user-end. I used to be very active on the platform but much like a lot of people, I just no longer see the appeal ‚Äì especially with other platforms being such strong contenders for users nowadays.

This differs from country to country though, so please keep in mind that my experience will likely be very different from yours."
socialmedia,fhy0f12,t3_f3q8v2,1581965971.0,"1. Try to get in on the trend of the day. It sounds dumb but you want to stay as relevant as possible and incorporate Twitter‚Äôs sense of humor and native audience. 
For example, not one big brand missed the Dolly Parton challenge. They all made it theirs and their audience appreciated it (at least in the beginning).

2. Don‚Äôt treat social media like a platform to sell through. Treat it like a platform to build connections and spark up conversations. Make the brand human and don‚Äôt be afraid to sound casual or too nice when you‚Äôre interacting with your audience. More often than not, they‚Äôre appreciate you for it.

3. Try to tailor your content to insights relevant to your audience. If the content isn‚Äôt relatable, insightful, or offers some kind of benefit your audience, think about how you can tweak it to maximize its potential."

From a user point of view, i‚Äôd be very interested in seeing the process of how you create your work. You can share carousel posts showing the Beginning and End of a piece in one post rather than 2 (like I saw on your page), or even a time-lapse of the entire process. This helps make your page more personal so your audience can engage with you and even ask questions about your work. It also makes for diverse type of content (statics and videos) and you‚Äôll get lots of views for it.

I‚Äôd also follow fellow artists. When you follow one you like, you will see a list pop up of similar ones you can follow as well. They will likely follow back, and you can do shout outs for one another to gain organic followers.

One thing that really works though is to choose a trending topic or hashtag (television series, band, video game‚Ä¶) that people are really taking about, and create your own piece about it. Use the right hashtags to get exposure and even tag certain accounts who‚Äôd be interested in seeing it and they might share it with their own followers.

Good luck!"

socialmedia,fhxy53j,t3_f3vxeg,1581964717.0,"In my experience it‚Äôs all about getting to know your audience. The more time you spend communicating with them, the better grasp you‚Äôll have on what works and what doesn‚Äôt. When you have a post that did significantly better than the rest of your posts, ask yourself why that is. What is it about this particular post that resonated with people? Was it the TOV? The insight? The CTA and how easy the post is to engage with? Likely, it‚Äôs all of them. 

I found organic exposure to be something very powerful that is often taken for granted. The Tag CTA is your best bet for getting as many people to see your content as possible. Once had a no-incentive post go over 6K comments when the page‚Äôs norm was around 500 max for a prize incentive. Most of that engagement came organically."
