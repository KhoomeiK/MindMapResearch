mentalhealth,fonjuqo,t3_g8hclu,1587920877.0,"Ok lad, lets get this clear im not a professional, but im going to try and help you. I was in the same boat with the anger, but mine was more of a long burn but it lead to similar thoughts as yours, and heres the thing, they will go away in time, but its not an easy road. Here are some tips to help you either lengthen your fuse or help with the thoughts.

Hold something cold, it sounds weird but it will help ground you, and/or take your mind off of it,Talk to someone, it often helps, now im not saying to some random tom, dick, and harry, go to a friend, family, or someone you trust, and tell them how you feel, it helps more than you thinkand finally don't lock up your anger, it may help in the short term but it will all come out. go to your bed and punch it a few times, go take a cold shower, or hell just swear alot, it will help relive the anger, and if you want my dm's are open."
mentalhealth,fonj5sh,t3_g8ho4y,1587920501.0,"Hey lad, if needed you can dm me and you can vent. But look i know its how it feels to be in this situation, since i was in it a few months ago, and look while now it seems like the only solution to your problems is suicide and/or changing yourself, cause you feel like your a burden, useless, not worth it, you feel like your faking it to your friends and family, and i get it, and yea life can be a nightmare and yea it is at times,  but ya wanna know something, nightmares  and dreams both only last a little while, and look, you will never be half a man, you have the courage to come and ask for help, that makes you more of a man than me, i don't know your family or your history, but i do know this, its better to talk with a mate than to suffer alone."
