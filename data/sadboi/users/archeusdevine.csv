This article describes the complete massacre of animals and dumping of food products due to a lack of infrastructure to send that food to places here in the US that badly need it. Our food industry is so poorly designed, when the idea of laws governing it was to make it more efficient. Really, it was to make it profitable for the few at the detriment of the many. Not just animals are harmed here, many human lives are being destroyed. It seems how we treat our food is a representation of how we treat ourselves."
