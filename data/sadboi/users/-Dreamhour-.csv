infp,fp8cpn0,t3_gboq65,1588389035.0,"If it helps, my writing process is to do what you seem to do, which is to just write and feel at the same time. You’re not really thinking— you’re just in a state of flow. Then, make a duplicate of what you just wrote and start to edit that. If you decide against any edits you’ve made then you can just look back at your original writing to understand what you were trying to say and how you were trying to say it.

Also, once you’re “done” with your edits, give it some time (maybe an hour or so) and come back to it. Reread and go through it again. More ideas will come to you. Something that helps me make some decisions in my writing is separating my ideas out with slashes. For example, I’ll use this strategy when I have multiple ideas on how to say something then I will write out each thing and separate each idea by a slash. I can then read through each phrase and sometime find ways to synthesize different phrases.

Even if I agree with whatever is being said, if someone uses that statement I can recognize that it’s also not really fair. To treat your own beliefs and ideas differently than someone else’s is hypocrisy. It’s a double standard. No matter how right you think you are when it comes to politics, your ideas are often just another opinion. Some may be better than others, but it depends on who you ask. Now, I think it applies to more and more things the more you remove humanity from the equation of whatever it is you’re talking about, but yeah. Basically if anyone finds themselves saying that, they may be hindering the way they themselves view not only politics, but the world at large."

My mom married someone a few years ago now who tested literally the exact opposite of her and she’s (and he’s) very, very glad with things the way they are.

As long as you are in a relationship with someone who understands the way you process it, you can be happy with them. “T” types aren’t heartless robots, in the same way that “F” types aren’t always emotional wrecks (maybe in this subreddit, though. 😉(just joking, I’m an INFP too, please don’t flame me 😅)).

I’ve been on the side of letting him stay dead for a while, but recently I’ve been thinking that KyoAni can make it work! I definitely feel that Violet needs to spend more time accepting that Gilbert is dead. It would maximize the emotional impact of her healing and acceptance, ensuring that when Gilbert returns, it does not feel like Violet needs him to cope. This will demonstrate that she is her own person now. So, with Gilbert’s return (and Violet’s growth being saved), room will be made for the excitement and pure joy of suddenly learning that Gilbert may actually be alive. However, I think it’d be smart to keep it semi-ambiguous (but plausible) at least for a bit, perhaps until the end. I think it will add to her emotional development (seeing how she deals with returning to her old coping mechanism of hoping he’s alive now vs. how she did originally would give her an opportunity to demonstrate her character growth).


TL;DR— The dichotomy of Violet’s  FULL acceptance of Gilbert’s death and the overwhelming joy she feels when she learns she IS actually able to share this emotion— love— that she’s been learning about with him would cause a massive depletion in the worlds supply of tissues.




**The only other concern I think a lot of people have is that they need to make his return believable. He got shot what, 3 times? One time in the frickin’ face. And being crushed by a building doesn’t help either. So yeah. I’m sure they can figure something out."
