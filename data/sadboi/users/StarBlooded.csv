autism,fobi4ee,t3_g6pd7j,1587660036.0,"Same boat. It's generally frustrating to see everything be about kids, and it's been particularly irritating for me trying to do research: trying to find resources as a writing tutor with autism? Trying to find research on writing for autistic college adults? Virtually impossible, everything's about autistic children. It's disconcerting, like we don't exist."
aspergirls,fnzixsa,t3_g4mix2,1587394957.0,"If your college has one, check in with your disability resource center about getting accommodations. I was able to get accommodations to request extensions, take absences, and take a few minute break from class when needed. They don't fix issues like your own struggles with studying, materials etc, but they do give you a better support to stand on."
aspergirls,fk3zmgn,t3_fgdl5b,1583850120.0,"I found out last night that existential philosophers Nietzsche and Sartre 's idea about free will are polar from one another — whereas Nietzsche does not believe in free will and condemns the idea, and Sartre believes that every person is ""condemned to be free"" and totally responsible for themself. Especially interesting considering that Sartre studied from Nietzsche. And so far I'm not convinced by either one lol"

BPDmemes,fj76w2m,t3_fbsyjk,1583087350.0,Anyone else hoard those types of messages as screenshots (probably incited vy emotional impermanence)? At least it's cathartic to delete them when you move on lol
