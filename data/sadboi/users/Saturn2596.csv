SuicideWatch,fg5njhg,t3_ex0ppn,1580532495.0,"You are not a bad person. If your mother truly loves you she wouldn’t be talking shit about you  and make you look bad in front of everybody. believe your not wrong. 

If their is a reason why u act that way there is probably something u want people to respect. Stand up to what u believe.

Just was having a fight with my dad couple days about stupid shit. The argument was him being contradicting me, being manipulative, being hypocrite, being ignorant, plays the victim, an always on the adult’s side when i know i am right. he thinks i am mental and i am the problem. But i know i am not because i know what i am talking about."

SuicideWatch,fcjamgd,t3_ehaclo,1577681467.0,"Find a way to like it. Have a end goal. Like going to the movies, video games, etc.

Find a reason why u should work. When i was getting a job for the first time i had deppression because of that job. Now i found a reason why i should work because i need money and whats my end goal. 

Motivate yourself basically."

SuicideWatch,fccwi5m,t3_eh1o65,1577603491.0,Probably the majority here in reddit can relate to this. You are not alone here seriously.
SuicideWatch,fccvou1,t3_eh1wm1,1577603207.0,Why she wants to kick u out?
SuicideWatch,fccp34t,t1_fcb104r,1577600976.0,"Yeah he should stand his ground to what he wants like i do to the point i was almost kicked out, see the problem? But i aint licking their feet and u know let them do what they want. My entire family are stubborn fools so i can relate to this VERY to the point i avoid them. 

If this stubbornness of his parent keep on going and beat him. He should go to somebody even the school or even a doctor."
