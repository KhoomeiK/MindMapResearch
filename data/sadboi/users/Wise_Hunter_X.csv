The unfortunate reality is that, yes, there isn‚Äôt anything good for left handed people, and you‚Äôll just have to deal with it."
SmashBrosUltimate,ffx2m95,t1_ffwxphp,1580316424.0,"It‚Äôs literally never been about damage or knockback with sheik in this game. She‚Äôs about winning neutral and getting combos and strings off with her frame data, as well as good edge guarding. What she fell short in that made all her qualities utterly USELESS was kill power: not knockback, but CONFIRMS. Her up smash and fsmash, as well as bouncing fish can all kill just fine, but her confirms into these moves were inconsistent, super specific, and borderline unviable. 

A huge portion of her kill confirms come from either short hop or falling needles. However, before this patch, she suffered an unfortunate amount of landing lag that made these options only usable in super late percents (130% and up). 
With her landing lag reduced after aerial needles, however, she can now do these confirms easier, and at earlier percents.

And what you are saying about complexity?
Her complexity is in her precision, in which case her kill confirms were too precise to use consistently, which they fixed in this patch.

Damage and knockback is not the issue, and I‚Äôm tired of people in this sub saying sheik buffs are useless when they clearly don‚Äôt understand the character. Not you specifically, but other posters with the ‚ÄúShEiK bUfFs ArE uSeLeSs‚Äù bullshit.

Edit: Also, survivability? The thing about survivability with sheik is in the issue with the rage mechanic. When a character can build up damage easily but can‚Äôt kill well, as mentioned earlier in this post, then the character has done near nothing but given the opponent rage, making sheik die quicker. 

Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm fighting a k rool, and I dominate neutral and rack up, say, 120%. But, (pre patch) my kill confirms are inconsistent, and now I can‚Äôt close out the stock. Now, I‚Äôm up against a near FULL RAGE heavy who, thanks to rage, can die in 3 hits. If (post patch) I could close stocks out earlier or more reliably, rage and thus survivability wouldn‚Äôt be too much of an issue. Get it?"
SmashBrosUltimate,ffw0jbk,t1_ffvq8l9,1580279353.0,Exactly! I hate everyone saying her buffs are worthless or meaningless. I swear it‚Äôs just people complaining that it‚Äôs not more damage or knockback.

Somehow, I can already see people exclusively spamming at least half of the moves I mentioned online.

HOWEVER, I do admit that since this was recorded two months ago, things might change, so we can only wait.

Edit: to answer your question, the character ITSELF doesn‚Äôt look toxic. I for one really like how Byleth looks.

Also, the trailer was mediocre, and Byleth looks kinda toxic and uninteresting. Given this was recorded two months in advance, it might be better on release though.
