DuggarsSnark,fippotx,t1_fin7uuv,1582615509.0,"That‚Äôs not usually how we do things, and we tend to have a lot more people in our sub coming here to purposely start shit than other subs. a few of our older and a few of our newer mods are taking a backseat right now. In time it will probably shift a little with our schedules. We also cover a vast variety of time zones because people tend to start things at different times. I would say a few of us spent upwards of 6+ hours modding a day. Sometimes you just need a break."
DuggarsSnark,fipnqd1,t1_fiosylo,1582613189.0,Locked bc one of y‚Äôall just isn‚Äôt getting the point.
DuggarsSnark,filesxx,t1_filcdw2,1582499965.0,"She will go through the introduction to modding like every other mod on the sub did. Criticizing someone who has not done any work on a sub is unfair to what someone‚Äôs potential in an environment can be. All subs have different modding styles and DS is in a change right now where we‚Äôre in a content drought which usually can make users upset. 

This is me speaking not as a mod, just as someone who enjoys this sub, you can never please everyone but disrespecting people directly for volunteering to put a lot of work and effort into something for free gets taken advantage off too often on reddit. 

We have so many mods so people can have life outside of the sub. I have no idea how Anne modded alone for so long on a growing sub. The mods here are in constant contact and we often switch out who is active so that people can have a break for other life people things. 

I don‚Äôt think anything crazy will come from this, when we added the last group of mods we tried to adapt the style of modding to them and it didn‚Äôt work. We corrected and I feel like we‚Äôve been doing a lot better and we understand each other as a team, and often we agree on the result of a modding decision together. I hope Anne acclimated to what we‚Äôve started doing and when the Duggars have more ‚Äúseasons of life‚Äù that offer snark our newer processes will work then too, if not we‚Äôll adapt. 

We try to allow negative feedback if it‚Äôs constructive, and not for the sake of complaining. We have had to accept that we can not make everyone happy and we have to appeal to the majority even though the most vocal tend to be the minority in opinions (which is why we do things like modding polls because people respond to those more than a comment thread). 

We‚Äôre not trying to censor the situation. But people doubting Anne from the get go, when many of the users in her old sub are confused be her removal by a seemingly absent owner, is probably not something that we will tolerate because due to the structure we have for modding now the things that people are concerned about shouldn‚Äôt be an issue over here."

Now that we‚Äôll both be 21 we wanted to branch out but Disney might still be fun for us and it guaranties the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù of two idiots returning home to their families who don‚Äôt love us going on vacation ‚Äúscary‚Äù places (ie probably anywhere in central america/ any island off florida. ) But I don‚Äôt generally feel in danger in any touristy area.
