So I'd also love to know why they act the way you describe. In my case I think he genuinely got SO mad over something relatively harmless because of his NPD, or he was in fact just using it as  a lame excuse. But I can't be sure.

This hits very close to home because it actually sounds pretty similar to case so I could very much identify with it. I also have BPD. I was 26 when I met the Nex and he was more than anything twenty years older. I'm not into older men usually, but he was soooo charming. He had 2 daughters close to my age, who (not surprisingly) didn't accept our relationship. Not that it mattered, because there were a lot of things which were off about the relationship. I know he was cheating WITH me at the during our first round. After the hoover, he was probably with someone else but I've never been able to prove that. He felt extremely uncomfortable when I spoke to his supposed ex-in laws. I've never had any real answers as to what was going on, but it looks a lot like a he was living a double life too, maybe even a triple or quadruple one. 

I'm very glad he's no longer in my life though, and I'm thanks to counseling and support from my friends and family, I'm now in a way better position than before I met him. I wish you the very best, you're better off without him and you deserve way better! <3"

At first, I also kept thinking of what could have been, but now I know that it wouldn't have ended well for me anyway. All of my Nex's relationships were unsuccessful.

NarcissisticAbuse,fod62j7,t3_g6pgdl,1587680513.0,"*Hugs* I'm so sorry this happened to you. I went through something very similar, only my relationship lasted way shorter than yours, so I imagine your pain is even worse. Mine also (seemingly) randomly broke up with me, while 2 weeks earlier, he had asked my father for my hand. The night before he called it quits, he said we'd be together forever. This  incomprehensible behavior is what made me do research and that's how I found out about NPD.   This was 5 months ago, but that was already our second round.

My short answer to your question is that he may hoover if he thinks you can offer him any more supply. Irregardless, of whether he hoovers or not, you're way better off without him. I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but you'll never get the relationship you deserve and you'll go through this same pain over and over again. Let me me elaborate my answer based on my own experience:

I can't predict what your Nex will do, but when mine hoovered , I had no clue what NPD was. Since I was still naive, I bought all his lies so it was easy to manipulate me.  I didn't think twice when he said our first breakup was all based on a misunderstanding. Therefore, I still genuinely believed he was a lovely person and did everything he wanted. At his point, I was still  an (as good as) unsuspecting victim. So yeah, he could still use me. 

When he discarded me the second time, I reacted very similar to what you described. I too cried my eyes and out begged him to stay and  eg asked him if he'd soon find a new girlfriend and he said ""of course."" Also, he said I was an awful person and that I was cuckoo and hysterical.


At that point, I still didn't know what NPD was, although I thought this was insane. I was furious but also  confused and hadn't expressed my anger yet. So he probably still thought he could easily trick me. 

 After the second discard, I sent him some naughty pics and he sure did come back to get in my pants. He even said he loved me again and that there was hope for us in future. However, it soon became clear to me that this was all bullshit and that his actions didn't match his words at all and I went bezerk at him. I told him EXACTLY what I thought about him. He's blocked me and I haven't heard from him since (early December). But I think that's because I stood up for myself. I think he may well have hoovered again if I hadn't lost it. I'm not convinced mine won't come back though, it hasn't even been 6 months. 

Your Nex may interpret your heartbreak as possible future supply. I've heard people say though, that it's YOU who does the final discard and not him. I think it certainly is possible and maybe even probable that he'll hoover, but you're better off without him. I'm glad I haven't been hoovered anymore and I've blocked my Nex everywhere. 

Stay strong :) you're awesome and you deserve way better!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fod1dny,t3_g6uypy,1587678652.0,"Well done for going no contact :) I know it's incredibly hard in the beginning, but you'll be better off in the long run. You deserve way better!! You absolutely do! I was only with my Nex for a relatively brief period, and for me it was already hard to grasp that he was no longer part of my life.  

In terms of withdrawal, it really can be like any other kind of addiction. I was also addicted to other substances, so I'm currently being treated for that, but the process is very similar. I'm not saying that everyone who has 'narc withdrawal syndrome' is an addict, but I think it's very important to go cold turkey. It's very good you've blocked him. I've done that too, and every now and again I feel like reaching out to him again. But I  tell myself that's the same as any other kind of relapse, since you'd be back in square one. Also, as with any other addiction, I believe that your cravings will eventually disappear, assuming you stay away from your 'drug of choice.' 

As for the panic attacks: I've sought different forms of therapy so I definitely think it's worth looking into that. I'm having some great online sessions now, for free. I wouldn't have been able to do it by myself and I'm not embarrassed to admit that and reach out or help :)

So well done, you've made the right choice. It's been about 6 months since I last heard from my Nex, and my life has only improved since. :) Stay strong! :)"

Actually, I was drunk when I made that call, I never would have done it sober. Or, if I had, I would have used some politer language. It did give me some peace, but it to an outsider, I probably did sound like I'd gone cuckoo.

NarcissisticAbuse,fn3dd4p,t3_fyotea,1586618398.0,"I've felt the exact same way. The Nex discarded me twice, the second time was completely out of the blue to me. I was devastated and begged for an explanation which he didn't give, other than that I was a horrible person; cuckoo, hysterical etc. He flat out told me he'd have a new girlfriend in no time, but had no problem stringing me along and hooking up with me while he saw what it did to me. Luckily, I had the self respect to call it quits. I haven't heard from him in almost 5 months now so I don't know if I'll ever be hoovered, but I think he's already gone through at least another 2 new supplies in the meantime. I don't actually know that, but it's a logical assumption based on his past behavior. 

As others have pointed out, unfortunately, he never loved you (or anyone else for that matter). It's hard to swallow, but it actually helped me understand how his 'feelings' could seemingly flip 180° overnight. 

For my Nex, I'm one of many. My narc was quite a bit older than me so he's probably been through over 100 supplies. And none of those could give him the happiness he wanted. So you and I will be hurting for a short time, but he's stuck with himself forever. 

My Nex lives in the same area as me, and I've actually found out the about half the town hates him. Not just his exes, but also (ex) business partners, former employees and even his own family members. 

Right now, I'm glad he's no longer part of my life and that I can now go on looking for someone I deserve and who deserves me. I'm also working on myself now, codependency and some other addictions. I think that once I've sorted that out, I probably won't understand how I ever could have fallen for the Nex in the first place. 

My life has actually improved a whole lot since I started working on myself after the discard and I'm doing better than before I met him. He's out of my life now, and again, the Nex will always be part of his own life and bring his misery along. So even though it looks as if he's moved on, he really hasn't, he's just changed some external factors.

A lot of people told me to leave it alone and move on, and even though they're absolutely right, it's not that simple. Obsessing about it and talking about it/sharing it, actually helped me a great lot. The more I learned about the disorder, the more I realized that he was the problem and not me. 

I got counseling and I regularly call people who've been through the same thing. Thanks to them, I've come to realize that I'm actually incredibly lucky to have been ""freed"" from the narc. I certainly don't consider myself lucky (yet) but I believe I will eventually. Also, I've started saying affirmations for my own peace of mind, and that actually works. 

I still think about the narc, but my life is actually even better than before I met him. My lifestyle is a lot healthier and I've kicked a lot of old bad habits. I'm not grateful to the narc because of that, but the situation definitely made me a whole lot of stronger. 

I know it's a cliche, but everything does get better in time. I'm no mental health professional but I think it's perfectly normal to be obsessing. To me it was inevitable, so talking about it was a huge relief :)

I don't feel sorry for the narc, nor do I think this excuses his behavior, but he's the one who's stuck with himself for the rest of his life. He probably has over a hundred women ( and lots of other people like business partners) hating him the way I do.  So I'm glad I left. I've blocked him on all social media so that he can't reach out to me again. I'm pretty sure it's only a matter of time before my narc ends up miserable and alone. That's not my wrathful, wishful thinking, that's just a natural consequence of his behavior. Almost everyone around him that I know, in all aspects of his life, has had a bad experience with him. 

So I wish you the very best, stay strong and I really think no contact is the best option. You deserve way better. :)"
unpopularopinion,fm3wf44,t3_fsqcwk,1585739479.0,"I completely agree. Perhaps not necessarily when consumed in moderation, but in large quantities, over long periods of time, it most definitely is a 'hard drug.' I' personally have done lots of drugs lots of drugs in the past, but the only one I actually got hooked on and it's taken me an innumerable amount of tries to finally get sober.  

Also, considering all the violence and accidents and addiction causes, I most certainly consider alcohol to be a hard drug when consumed in large quantities."
NarcissisticAbuse,fm2aibh,t3_fsamnv,1585693635.0,"Affirmations. What helped me was saying affirmations about forgiving him and wishing him the best. Yeah, I didn't mean A SINGLE WORD when I just started, but2 weeks later I was a lot calmer.  So the idea is that the affirmations get imprinted into your subconscious. So I basically kept repeating those phrases, the idea behind it is pretty much ""fake it till you make it."" :)

Trust me, I know exactly how you feel. I've never harmed anyone physically but I imagined the same kinds of things. It's been just over 4 months since the last time I interacted with him, and the urge for revenge only JUST started getting less. People told me the usual ""he's not worth your anger."" They're 100% right, but that wouldn't came me down.  

&#x200B;

Of course, as others have pointed out, hobbies, distracting yourself etc  helps you forget about him temporarily. Despite the fact that this has been incredibly beneficial, this didn't take the actual fury towards him away, but affirmations did.

NarcissisticAbuse,fm06isq,t3_fs52c0,1585646683.0,"Hey, I'm sorry you're going through such a hard time! 

But the short answer is yes, therapy has definitely helped me. I got 2 forms of therapy. One was 'regular'  therapy with a psychiatrist, and it really helped me to have someone to talk to. 

What helped me most though, was a form of holistic therapy with a life coach, who is slightly more expensive.  Her program includes a lot of meditation, and a healthier diet, I guess a lot of self awareness. After just one session with the coach, people noticed that my state of mind had taken a tremendous step forward. 

Because her help is rather expensive, I only see her like once every 3 weeks, but I think that's actually better because you're gonna have to go without counseling eventually. But the meditation is something I can do on my own every day. 

Also, I haven't tried this for NPD  abuse, but for some other problems, there are online Zoom meetings for people recovering from a similar problem. The ones I've joined are usually (as good as) free. I actually think that talking to people who have gone through the same thing has helped me more than therapy, I'm not sure if there's any costs attached to that though. 

Anyway, I wish you the very best, stay strong :)"

alcoholic,flyk2u5,t3_fk13yo,1585603628.0,"Hey :) I know this question is 2 weeks old, but I'd like to give you my take on it. I just turned 27 and I'm currently three months sober after 5-6 years of chronic alcoholism. I believe (based on a recovery program) that the disease of addiction/alcoholism is in some cases innate. In that case, age doesn't matter. Also, an alcoholic can technically drink as much as a non alcoholic, or even less. The difference is that an alcoholic develops a craving, and is unwilling, or sometimes even unable to quit drinking once s/he's started. I could technically stop myself after 2 drinks, even though I'd have hated to, but I'd keep obsessing about alcohol and go on the next day, until I had 'enough.' In my case, 'enough' would mean a black out. 

Also the fact that you're drinking alone is something a lot of alcoholics, including myself, can relate to. 

By the way, I was never the ""stereotype alcoholic'', aka an old tramp who sleeps under bridge with a bottle of stroh rum in his hand. A lot of people actually had no idea I drank too much. 

I obviously don't know you, nor am I a mental health professional, but the fact that you're on here asking if you're an alcoholic, sounds like you're an alcoholic in denial. Please don't me wrong, I'm not saying that's you, it's just the way it sounds to me based on my own experience. 

During my drinking career, time and space meant absolutely nothing to me. I'd drink in the morning, the afternoon, the dead of night, before job interviews, during classes....

Also, I could never drink at a normal pace. I'd shotgun/chug every single drink for the effect, whereas a non-alcoholic mainly drinks for the taste, certainly if they're in a restaurant or at a conference of something. 

I really couldn't quit drinking despite all the problems it caused me. And I think that's another indicator: not being able to quit despite the negative consequences. 

Sometimes I'd make limits for myself, like ""no more than 3 drinks in one occasion, and only 3 times a week."" I always broke my own promises and really had to learn the hard way in order to finally realize I couldn't go on.  

So I hope this doesn't happen to you, and great that you're asking this question at so young an age :)"
NarcissisticAbuse,fly837u,t3_fqjwah,1585597275.0,"After the second discard, he still kept stringing me along. Once his games had become totally obvious to me, I called him up and yelled at him and told him the truth. From then on, I never heard from him again. I got drunk in Berlin on NYE and I threw a few more insults at him on WhatsApp, and he's blocked me ever since. I haven't heard from him since, no do I expect to hear from him again in future. I'm not proud of the fact that I insulted him in a rather childish way, but I think he treated me way worse. Still not an rationale for me to act that way though. But I made it clear that I was absolutely fed up with him and that I was no longer guilt tripping.

I'm feeling free, and recently, I've actually come to terms with it. That is, I no longer wish to try again with the Nex, nor do I wish anything bad to happen to him. 

I feel like a worthy human being again.  He said I'd  gone cuckoo and that I was hysteric, while he often got into physical fights and problems with the law. 

Now, I can focus on my personal development, improve my foreign language skills, creative arts skills and cooking skills. And can do that for myself now, at my own pace, without having to prove myself to anyone. And yeah, I feel like I've dodged a bullet. 

I guess that before I met the narc, I was incredibly naive and believed that everyone (at least in my direct environment had the best intentions. Now, I know better. I'm not going to let the Nex ruin my world view and my faith in humanity, but I'll know a little better when to keep my guard up.

NarcissisticAbuse,flxzw2j,t1_flxwwyv,1585592967.0,"PS 

The reason I consider 3-4 months relatively long, is because I was only with the narc for a short amount of time. It was a very intense relationship nevertheless, but very short lived. 

I understand though, that if you'd been with the narc for like (this is just an example) a year or more, the time to heal would be significantly longer"
NarcissisticAbuse,flxwwyv,t1_flxu023,1585591372.0,"Well done for making this the final discard! It really is one of the best choices I've ever made. 
 
The short answer to your question is that it took me about 6 weeks to be able to lead a seemingly normal life again, and about 3-4 months to regain by peace of mind (but I think that's longer than average)

I was discarded on the 22nd of November and the first month was pretty hard, but it was generally because I had no idea what was going on and I was constantly blaming myself.  

On the outside, I've actually been doing pretty well from the beginning of January and on (meaning I hadn't processed it yet, but it no longer manifested itself in my daily activities). I ended up picking up my old hobbies like music and working out (from home right now), and it really helped to be in touch with people who knew where I was coming from . 

Once the guilt went away, it mainly turned into anger but the fact that I got counseling and started meditating greatly helped. 

These past 2 weeks, I could say that it no longer really bothers me 'at all."" I genuinely felt bad for the Nex when I realized his business would probably be hit pretty badly by the current economic recession. So at this point, I just don't really care anymore, I don't want to get back with him, nor do I wish anything bad upon him. 

So I guess it took me about 3-4 months to get over it completely, but I think that may be a bit longer than average, since I have some of my own mental (cluster B) issues as well."
NarcissisticAbuse,flxookg,t3_frt7ye,1585586923.0,"Hey, I'm sorry that you're going through this right now, I've been there too. I really was addicted to the narc the same way an alcoholic or junkie craves their drug of choice.  Anyway, there are some things and thoughts which helped me :)

Delete his number and delete him on all social media. If you simply don't have any way of contacting him anymore, you can no longer be tempted. Some people have even said it has helped them to get a new number and to (temporarily) deactivate their own social media accounts. 

What helped me was reading articles and other people's posts about NPD, which made me realize how similar the narcs behavior seemed in a lot of the stories. This made me realize that mine (most likely ) wasn't the exception, and that sooner or later relationship would have ended anyway. 

Eventually, I came to realize that the person I thought I was in love with, didn't really exist.

I was completely confused at first and had no idea what had just happened since I had no clue I was dealing with a narcissist. I was also completely heartbroken and I had been made to believe it was all my fault. Because I was so convinced about this, and because the narc had set me up in an incredibly clever way, many people around me also thought that he was being reasonable and that I'd blown it myself. 

I soon realized the truth though and started working on myself through a healthier diet, counseling and picking up old hobbies. 

I'm currently in a better mental state than before I met the narc and I hope you will soon feel the same way too.

NarcissisticAbuse,flqklol,t1_flph9iy,1585398318.0,"Hey there, sorry for the late reply and I'm glad you had calmed down a bit. 
I can't tell you what you're supposed to do and I don't think anyone else can either, but I don't think you should cut off the positive things they taught you. Were these things you did together with the narc, which therefore remind you them? In that case I can imagine the painful association, but if you're into that it's YOUR hobbies,and yours alone. I think the same applies if these are activities you did on your own in order to get over the narc. 

I can't answer your questions for sure because I don't know you or the narc, nor am I a mental health professional, but the fact that you're feeling down, guilt tripping and doubting yourself more or less 'proves' to me that you're not a narc.  Despite all the posts and articles I've read about narcs' way of thinking, their mind, motives and intentions are still a mystery so I don't know whether or not they've done that to hurt you (intentionally). Based on what I've read though, it does sound like a very narc thing to make their victims obsess about them. 

It really sucks that even helping yourself reminds you of them. Something that worked for me, is to see the thing/hobby as something UNrelated to the narc. For example, a narc I knew and I were really into the French author Albert Camus. Since I hated the narc, I didn't want to have anything to do with Camus' books either, since it reminded me of the narc. But then, in reality, the narc has nothing to do with Camus. Camus was active during the first half of last century, he has millions if not billions other admirers and there's no connection between him and the narc at all. Neither is there any 'real' connection between your hobbies and the narc. He wasn't the inventor of those things, nor is he the only one who practices them. I don't know this is what you're referring to, but seeing the hobby as a separate thing, really helped me. 

Hold on and stay strong, I wish you the very best, and the fact that you're grateful to the narc and looking at his positives sides and showing humility, means you're a wonderful person :)"

Your dad is powerless over the alcohol, and he can only stop when he genuinely wants/needs to do so himself. The fact that you're trying to hide his booze from him proves how much you care about him, but this is no long term solution of he doesn't want to stop drinking himself. Like others have said, acute withdrawal can in fact be very dangerous. It does, however sound like your dad needs help. If he won't listen to you, are there perhaps any friends/family members who he would listen to, and maybe do an intervention with them? Again, whether he'll follow through or not will depend on no one other than himself. 

Now regarding yourself: you really do need help, and at the moment, you can only help yourself. As someone else pointed out,  Al Anon (related to Alcoholics Anonymous) is a very good program for addicts friends and family, but there's also plenty other support groups.

Luckily, thanks to support groups like this one, I'm currently in a better mental state than I was before I met him, and so will you! 

Now to answer your question: I'm sorry to tell you, but a narc never apologizes, because in their minds, they are perfect and invincible, and if they do apologize, it's probably fake. They've created a facade, referred to as the false self, which they see as perfect. They can only see themselves and others as perfect or failure, and admitting they are wrong would mean they're imperfect and therefore a complete failure.

The fact that you've unmasked them, meaning you've seen through the facade, makes it even less likely that you'll get an apology. If you'd have gotten an apology, it probably would have been a false one to suck you back into their vacuum (hoover), and manipulate you over and over. The fact that you've unmasked them means it's going to be a lot harder (if not impossible) for them to trick you again.
