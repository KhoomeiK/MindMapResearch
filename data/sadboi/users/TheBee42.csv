That's absolutely not acceptable.
I know it's sometimes hard to say no. I had a boyfriend who wouldn't take a no. Not that he'd get aggressive, no he would start making puppy eyes and quite literally beg for it. And not in a sexy way, in a desperate way.

So at some point I figured it's faster to just get it over with instead of arguing, getting asked again and again and again and even being woken up. He literally didn't care how I felt, even if I was in physical pain he wouldn't back off until I said okay just whatever.

This. Is. Not. Okay. 
Complete disregard for your feelings is not okay. 
Putting his ""needs"" before you is not okay.
It shows how little your worth to him and it makes your relationship really unhealthy."

This is abuse on so many levels... I'm really sorry you have to deal with that.
Do you have a friend's place where you can crash? It seems like you are living in a very toxic environment. You should definitely consider counseling once your out if that hell, otherwise you might not notice the toxic traits you picked up from living there.

Since you are living in Germany:

- there is free counseling for university students so i'm quite sure something similar exists for pupils 

- there are a lot of support systems for teenagers in your situation. It's possible to get bafög even if you are still in school and once you have that you can live in special cheap apartments which are only open for people with bafög support (I had one ~20 square m, small kitchen and bathroom, everything very clean with huge windows and around 250€/ month including everything from internet to water cost)

Please consider talking to someone who knows a bit more about this stuff. Since you are already 15 it's very possible that you can get out of there an get your own apartment with the help of the government. 

Good luck!"

He'll ""balance"" on pretty much anything that's at least 10cm above the ground and I have to hold his hand so he won't ""fall"" while he pretends to be a 5yo again.

We bike around ever other day or go bouldering. We'll pack some lunch/snacks and just spend a few hours in the forest climbing/ biking. 

When I'm excited I'll jump up and down like a child. We build Lego, play board games, anything we want really!

Sometimes we'll spend the evening with old school friends of his. He always says he feels like they pretend to be grown up. They can't laught about the same things anymore and in his option it's because they think they are too old for that.

My friend are the complete opposite. They don't care about age, they just do what makes them happy. Sometimes it's sitting around reading a book and sometimes it's festivals or camping or finger painting like kids. 

There's nothing like a age limit to these things. The only thing you need is someone you can be childish with. Someone who's comfortable with goofing around. It's never too late to be happy :)

Ps: My advice for you: Just start doing whatever it is you want to do. Especially with sports there are always communities with cool people who love to welcome new people. I started doing a lot of things I used to be scared of because my boyfriend supported me and I realised there was nothing to be scared of. Everyone in the bouldering and biking community has been super nice. So now I even go alone every now and then and there are always nice people I can talk to :)"

I'd ask myself where he picked that up, if I fucked up or how I should react to that. And I'm fairly sure a kid will go through a few gross interests during childhood but never really hold on to them.

But your son is 18. After 5 years it's not just a phase and he isn't a little boy anymore. He's a grown adult and it's his choice to draw these things. It might have been okay to freak out when he was 13, to tell him you think it's weird and things like that. I might have done the same simply because I would have been overwhelmed with the situation. But you'll have to admit that he has shown that he doesn't care what you think about it. And you can't force your believes onto him, it'll just force him away from you.

If it bothers you so much maybe tell him to just keep it in a drawer where you can't see it? Tell him he can draw whatever he wants you just don't want to see it or talk about it. You don't have to approve everything he does but I think it's time you accept his decision and give him some freedom. It's not like you have to be involved in everything he does.

Well than that means this and that"" and I'll be like ""no that's not what I meant!"" So I'll correct myself again and again until he is in a ""corner"" meaning he can't twist my words anymore and has to actually react to what I said. But I don't force him, I ask if he wants to talk at the beginning and it's okay he says he doesn't want to talk about it anymore at some point of the conversation. 

And I never start this conversation myself, it only happens when he ""jokes"" about being a disappointment or suicide or something like that. (""Jokes"" because his tone is completely serious)
Or when he rants about not understanding how other people can be so happy/ why others seem to have it so muche easier etc.

I usually tell him that I'm concerned when he ""jokes"" about things like that. At first I had to explain to him why I even care about that(/him) and after that he just keeps saying something like ""just take care of yourself you are more important"" of ""you're overthinking"".

Sometimes I see dads with their children. Doesn't really matter weather they are babies or in my age, it just hurts. Sometimes I hear a voice similar to his or someone who speaks like him. First I'll get all tense, looking around to check but once I'm sure it's not him I get really sad. 

I'm vvvvvlc with him cause every now and then I need some info from him for get financial support (I'm a student). Just yesterday he texted me asking if I needed his info again. This little message is enough to throw me off for days. It just reminds me of everything.

For twenty one pilots I recommend to read the lyrics while listening because they are hard to understand if you don't know them. 

I recommend 

migrane (it will not let me sleep, I'll get some sleep when I'm dead and sometimes death seems better than the migrane in my head)

Kitchen sink (No one else is dealing with your demons

Stressed out (I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink but now I'm insecure, and I care what people think)

After that I went no contact for some years but then slowly started to build up contact again. Well at some point he started calling me names, accusing me of all sorts of stuff and I cut him out again.

For some reason I decided to give him another chance which ended pretty much the same way. Both times I felt incredibly hurt even though I should have anticipated that. I still want to talk to him.... I just want to have a dad like every kid does. But in the end I'll just get hurt because of who he is.

So for your own sake remind yourself of how he made you feel. Remember the hurt and the pain. If he doesn't even apologize he didn't change so he'll just hurt you again and again and again."

You might remember the ""black death comeback"" in China (at least I think it was China).

While it was some kind of the black death but not the exact one you red about in history books because it mutated and evolved since then. So you need new medicine against it. But that again leads to the virus/ bacteria/whatever developing resistance so you have a new type again where you need a new medicine."

depression,fdkfbip,t3_elv8fk,1578502661.0,"Hey there I sort of know how you feel... I used to be rather extroverted, always had my little group of friends with my bestie always by my side.

Well we moved away but due to some family stuff came back somewhat around 6 months later. There's been some changes in my little group and my best friend had become close with someone else. And that person was afraid to loose that status cause I was back so my best friend had to decide. Well it hasn't been me and I never managed to get a real social life after that. Even after school when I started to study it's been hard for me to get real friends (probably because I didn't think anyone really liked me).

The best thing that happened to me was that I started bouldering. There a big community where I live and they are amazing. Even if you go to the gym alone there will be people who try the same routes so you think about the problem and discuss and just get to talk. Just being there makes you part of the community. 

So that's my advice for you: explore new things, do what you love and get into the community for that. It's so much easier when you have something bigger in common. No matter what that is for you I'm sure there's other people who enjoy the same thing and would love to talk with you about it."

So for me there are some reasons for having sex toys. 

1. I used to be single and even now there are times when I don't see my boyfriend for a while

2. Me and my boyfriend are very comfortable around each other but we both think sex is overrated. But if we want to feel pleasure and the other ones not there or not in the mood there's always the option of self stimulation

3. Even if the toy is something like a vibrator we can still use it together. It's nice to play with each other with toys.  And vibrators are a good for teasing during foreplay ;D"

The only thing I can say is: family is optional. It might hurt, especially when you look at other kids and how they grew up and so on but in the end you have the option to cut them out. Maybe not right now but eventually you'll be old enough to take matters into your own hands.

I'm not an expert but my eating disorders as well as my anxiety are strongly linked with depression and I don't need a real reason to be depressed.

I just get sad. Nothing is fun anymore. And I hate it. So I'll get mad and even sadder because I hate myself so much for being like this. Why does my brain prevent me from enjoying the things I love? And my friend will look at me and say ""why are you so sad? Why are we here if you don't like it"" and I'll start crying because I don't know. I love me hobby and I don't know what's wrong. And I can't explain and I know I scare them away. And I hate myself so much for this. There is no reason and without a cause I don't know how to fix myself.

And then it stops. And I feel ok again. But I know it will be back. If it's a week or months, it doesn't matter. At some point I will start feeling weirdly disconnected. And then I'll be numb again. And the next moment I'll cry in public with no real reason. I'm just sad and I don't know why."
depression,f8mn548,t3_e108mg,1574632961.0,"Hey there! I know it's shitty... Not sure if you want to read any of this but I wanted to share a bit of my experiences.

One thing was when I was a kid in elementary school. Some other kid in my village invited me over to play. I had fun and I thought he did as well until he and his sister turned the clocks ahead so I'd go home earlier... they could have said something but I guess it was funnier like that. Most of my childhood and teenage years had been like this. Most people would only interact with me to make fun of me... Or use me

Another little story: we lived in a small village. my parents had horses so we had a lot of space (little money so most things were in more or less okayish condition). My parents split because my dad got violent towards my mum and we moved away for half a year. When we moved back we moved in with my grandpa and the few friends I've had ignored/mocked me. Around a year later my former best friend started talking to me again. When her birthday came around she wanted to celebrate and asked if we could go to my place. So I reached out to my dad and got it all planned (she knew what happened and that I didn't have much contact with him). And nearly everyone from our class plus some other people showed up. I knew everyone but most people acted like I wasn't even there. Even though it's basically been my home. Even though I talked to my abusive dad to get that done. 

I've always been too stupid to see when I'm being used because I craved any sort of social contact. Just be smarter than me and it's gonna be alright :)

Ps: I'm doing fine now :) got a great boyfriend, my own apartment, two cute cats and some really good friends. Sometimes I'm still a little uneasy because I'm afraid of being annoying and everyone leaving again but most of the time I'm fine :)"

 My mom had some beef with the people at kindergarden so i got into first class when I was 5 (usually it's 6 in Germany - just in case its difference in other countries) which means - again - no kid was my age.

I gotta say sometimes it's better to have friends your age cause you get easily left behind when they want to go out but you can't cause the club won't let you in or stuff like that. Also you might get pressured into things even though your not really interested in them yet. But that's really just a thing if all your friends are older than you (and a bit dickish)

I've had an eating disorders for some years and i never took it serious because I still managed everything fine. It's got really bad when I started going to university because

- I really needed some sense of control

- I didn't have much money

- I didn't even want to feel good... I craved feeling dizzy because I deserved it, because I felt strong when I still managed to drag myself into class and because I didn't have anything that needed energy like friends or hobbys

So your post sort of reminds me of myself. No matter what my mom said I'd just shrug it off.

The turning point for me has been when I started to randomly bleed (female and on the pill so that never happened before and really shocked me). I started reading about the health issues caused by malnutrition and convinced myself I needed to get better. It took a lot of breakdowns in front of my boyfriend (only person close to me during those years) and cutting out some toxic persons  but I managed it.

Now I live relatively healthy and do some sports and found work I enjoy :) 
Whenever I feel like not eating I remind myself about the things I've planned for the day and it really helps feeling like I have some reason to stay and a reason to care about myself :)

That being said: its worth holding on, it's worth getting better. You deserve to treat yourself well."
