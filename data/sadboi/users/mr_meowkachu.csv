Celiac,fq8u5y3,t3_ghbme6,1589175617.0,"There is a lot and I mean a whole universe of Indian food which is not wheat based. Restaurants in other parts of the world usually have the recognisable Punjabi and some north Indian food which revolves around wheat. I am from South India originally and until my Coeliac first manifested I didn't cook as much. But now I fall back on those recipes from home. Rice based stuff. Rice cooked normally, rice powder with coconut steamed, wet ground rice and pulses fermented and then steamed into idli or fried into crisp dosa, made into flat savoury pancake like things and I forget what else. Also depending on the region there are many different ways you can prepare meat or vegetables which are usually not available in Indian restaurants in other countries. Also a north Indian friend has told me that outside the cities alternatives for wheat were always used frequently as a nutritious substitute to flat bread. But he admits it is challenging to form because gluten makes everything elastic and hold together. I don't trust restaurants much anymore even where I live in Germany. Have been glutened many times and it gives me the worst sleeplessness and stress. Unless it's upscale and advertises as Gluten Free I cook for myself. 

You could try some recipes from the Internet to see if you like something."

Kerala,fotyokw,t1_fotydmh,1588070824.0,"In Germany. Specifically. What's to expand. Got shouted at by bouncer to stay out before I could get in a word edgewise in Stuttgart. Same place hosts InterNations events when it's convenient for them. Disgusting pricks.  There was a big group of people Indian guys and girls who were working in Bosch. The bouncer first refused and after the German guy accompanying them did some talking said the girls could go in first and maybe later the guys could. This kind of behaviour sums up a lot of things for me. Don't ask me what though.Rudely gestured by bartender in student bar in Aachen for almost a minute to get out. I couldn't fathom what was happening and was staring in disbelief for a while. Lot of curious onlookers, zero empathy zero intervention, everything continued as if nothing happened.  Countless stories from friends who were denied entry even with female company. They have a quota for Ausländer in many of these places. And on some important occasions you are not welcome when on other days you might have already been. In many many cases you need to have the company of German people for it to be okay. Exceptions are usually bars with a cosmopolitan outlook on the outset or Cuban and Irish places in my experience. 

Ah I forgot during my student days they needed our passport to gain entry to a place where I've been multiple times before. We were a group of 3 guys and girls all Indian.

Not the same in other European countries. Need to see on a case by case basis. I've had zero problems in big cities in Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic and even small towns in Croatia. They were quite welcoming tbh."
Kerala,fottrr1,t3_g9iyko,1588065841.0,"The west is not a monolith. For instance where I live there are many people who are still uncomfortable with sharing space with someone of a different skin colour. I've had looks of disgust when going in to a slightly upscale restaurants from some of the other patrons. This kind of attitude shows a huge intellectual weakness in my understanding. Just one of the many experiences I've had.

Also when it comes to sexism. It's not the same scale as in India but it exists. I have examples of that too. What comes to mind right now is an air BnB owner in Switzerland telling me to ""keep my woman in order""; a friend of mine who caused us to check out pretty late by taking her sweet time.

I've been a decade away and in sure im ignoring a lot of problems back home. But acceptance of different people is a very very rare trait when you look at the entire world. Tourists and the US,UK and Australia are not representative of the entire west. This is a very simplistic way of thinking. You need to live in other places and outside major cities to realise the true picture. Having lived a decade away abroad and seeing how the society where I live functions I think Kerala is quite special. Your experience is different but it is impossible to coalesce the west into some liberal utopia. Man, things are bad in unexpected ways in many other places.

Edit: Also the bar scene lol. Try to get into a moderately good bar as an Indian male in Germany on an important occasion.  There might be the odd one which does not have a problem but ho ho are you sweet summer children in for a surprise. Outside Cologne and Berlin of course. They are not at all representative. At least people don't treat me like shit if I want to go to an upscale bar in India. Don't laugh but it's fucking traumatic for me now. So many humiliating experiences."

I stick to German to make them comfortable even though me speaking in English would mean better clarity and efficiency in communication. What I've seen and experienced is there are people who can speak okay English but don't want to look foolish and hence don't try. Maybe it's different in different regions.

Also pet peeve. The foreigners office does not speak German. Imagine that, first point of contact for foreigners where you , as a foreigner who just moved to study for instance, need to speak good German to get things done and in some cases treated with normal amount of respect. All from my experience. With real consequences which changed the course of my life. Just because I couldn't speak good German I got screwed over at the foreigners office once during my student days.

AskReddit,fkmyc5f,t3_fj9mls,1584345050.0,"About 6 years ago, I was studying for my master's degree in Germany as a foreign student and towards the end of my studies I was in a bad place. Till then I was a decent student and got good grades. But midway through my master thesis I got hit by anxiety attacks. There was a lot going on in my life then. I was a naive idiot as well when it came to people and how cruel they could be. Suffice to say some people screwed me over emotionally and on hindsight that was the first time my coeliac disease hit. I woke up one day and simply couldn't face anyone. I stayed in my student room for a week and only mustered up enough courage to venture out to buy groceries. My thesis was the chance of a lifetime and I was ruining it. My whole sense of self was wrapped around my academic performance and it was shattered. I ended up doing just okay after I recovered a little but it was like I was crippled emotionally afterwards. 

During this time there was an American server for team fortress 2 where I used to lurk late at night because of the time difference. In the absence of reliable friends at the time and since I was unable to face new people in person this was like a godsend. Every evening I would look forward to pushing the cart on beerbowl, bad water, pier etc with a group of stellar people who used to speak on the mike. I only used text because my confidence was so low at that point I was worried about being made fun of because of my accent in English. But it felt amazing when I was able to hold a hotly contested point as engineer or when a last minute ubercharge turned a game around. Also I loved how conducive to humour team fortress 2 inherently is. I have fond memories of retreating to Monty python references with someone screaming 'run away' with a Brit accent. Nowadays most of the regulars from them have moved on but some part of the community is still active but I think my time with that is done. 

I am thankful for those people because they were support when my world was crumbling so to speak."

But I would have appreciated the fine gentlemen sitting at the bar to step in and say something instead of staring at me with genuine cold curiosity when the barkeep rudely gestured me to leave the bar with a disgusted look on his face. Right in the middle of a busy student town in Aachen.

I have been shouted at by a bouncer in Stuttgart before I uttered even a word when he abruptly jumped in front of me as I wanted to get a beer from the bar of a club where my then girlfriend was just 5 minutes ago. Not one person blinked an eye. It was like everything is normal. Me getting treated like trash while I was polite all the way was normal everyday stuff.

Middle of student district at 9 pm some tattooed fuck punches the dustbin as me and a friend are walking back from a study hall. I look back and having faced a few of these incidents and not reacting the last few times I reached for my phone to call the cops. He shouts at me thats all you can do and he comes right up to my face and shows me his forearm tattooes, points at them and says something. I am frozen at that point not knowing what to do for a second. His friend grabs him and they move away laughing afterwards. Not one person intervened or even asked if I was okay. There were at least 10 people witnessing this. There was no reason to think that it was a private thing because of the obvious difference in clothes.

Even today in front of my own home as I am removing frost from the windshield of my own car, the lady who walks by me looks at me with such unbridled hate I need a few hours to get my mind off her. Which is funny because I have a rather pleasant face lol.

Last week some random idiot just walks up to me when I am standing in the Stuttgart Hbf mutters abuse at me in Hindi(God knows where he learnt it from) and walks off. I look at him perplexed because wtf.

Many people here really have a problem and that is not having the guts to ""individually"" intervene even if they witness something. It is very easy to make grand gestures and denouncements. I see the same sickness in my home country and frankly it is doing a lot of damage. All the hand wringing is not going to help till you make it clear to people next to you feel in their bones that it is not okay to behave like this or at least that if they behave like this there will be immediate social ostracism if not legal ramifications. It is no more freedom of expression at that point. In civilized society it is not okay to be an asshole and you should have fear and shame to express your base tendencies.

When someone utters unacceptable jokes at the workplace. When something ""mild"" happens to a stranger in a public place. Please say something. Try and do that for once. Intervene immediately. It will be appreciated. And that will be a clear signal.

I have been told of waiting periods of more than a month in a smaller city for an appointment for a skin ailment. Same experience over a decade for other issues as well. I still cannot fathom that in a developed country it is a literal chore to get access to a doctor.

I am talking about appointments in clinics. Directly going to a hospital I would possibly get treated on the same day but the times I have gone I have had to wait from 2 - 4 hours. Also some doctors have been very unprofessional, on one occasion giggling while prescribing treatment for constipation(I did not know that my stomachache was because of that prior to the appointment). On another, the examining doctor literally bruised me while checking my abdomen for same above mentioned stomach pain.

Back in my small town in my home country for the 25 years I lived there, I have always had very good and prompt care at any clinic or hospital I have had to go.

A better response would have been to pull his friend away and chastise him, being police and such.

Most people are not like that. But the minority of assholes seriously do not fear behaving badly here I must say. Which is why it happens. I've had glassy eyed looks from onlookers right when some idiot said something racist or gestured rudely to get out of a bar or when a bouncer shouted at me to stay out when I was about to talk to him. Usually you encounter such behavior outside decent society in my experience. More intervention is in order people, seriously. Please do something and shame people like this even if it is your friend. If you can't talk sense into a friend or an acquaintance you have no business staying with said person or tolerating them."
germany,fegwjdi,t1_feeq6nw,1579104117.0,"I'm still here because I have to be because of financial obligations but I plan on moving as soon as I can afford to.

The only people from elsewhere who I know are successful here(**who are not sycophants**) have an exceptional level of emotional intelligence and are with their partners and spouses. They have a system to navigate the pitfalls here and do not really speak their minds in the general public. They do well financially and in their jobs so they give more weight to their success there and ignore all the issues above. But it' such a strain imo. Why live a kind of double life just to avoid sticking out in a society which considers you as errant children who need to be chastised.

On a psychological level that is the problem according to my observation. As a society, the parent part of their personality in the transactional analysis framework is too dominant(Check out games people play and im ok, youre ok). Hence the need to criticize others using poorly constructed stereotypes and generalizations. And on the other hand most people who have not smothered their child part are so far off to the other extreme they come out being obnoxious and or/riddled with weird ways of compensating. Hence the maniacal pursuit of travel and wellness. You can observe the lack of balance. ""Specialization"" is only gonna take you so far in improving your quality of life.

A friend of mine observed that many people here are so mean to each other that maybe it's just how it's always been and I think people from other races/cultures are just easy targets now. As for the housing thing and so on I already made peace with that. I've had people on dating websites abruptly stop after learning that I am Indian lol. They assumed I was hispanic or something in the beginning since I use my pet name. That was kind of funny but enlightening.

I was lucky with my room. Somehow the landlord learned that I like video games and apparently even his father used to play Doom in its heyday  😂."

You can filter out food which fit your allergy/dietary restrictions and order them in bulk. They usually deliver in 3-4 days. Most brands available in supermarkets will be on stock. They even have relatively freshly baked items available depending on what day of the week you order. If you live/work in a small town this is definitely a good option as compared to the local supermarket. 

I used their service for a year and was happy.  I filter out gluten/lactose as well ;).

Edit: Schär has an app listing restaurants with gluten free items on the menu. Also big cities should have cafes which have limited gluten free pastries in stock."
germany,fe3clda,t1_fdtu4dh,1578848052.0,"I've been here almost a decade and could give you some tips to help you avoid mistakes in case you are interested. 

But before making the decision, if you are from a tier 1 or 2 institute in India I would highly recommend you avoid Germany for a master's degree unless you have a specific reason for being here. There are many challenges which are non issues in the usual higher education destinations like the US and UK. And yes racism happens. You mostly only hear the good stories on this subreddit. Not their fault. Ranting is not encouraged and that is fair. But the people who have negative experiences seldom speak out."

I love how you so effortlessly assume that it was some kind of argument between people having a difference of opinion. Keep enjoying the illusion. It is not you who suffer the consequences of such bad behaviour but people who are supposedly vulnerable and easy targets. I can't count the number of times I have been humiliated just for kicks. And I am not alone. There are many of us who get by with our heads down. It's just that they are not vocal on echo chamber subreddits.

germany,fdqsaxb,t1_fdq64gn,1578673809.0,Oh come on man. I've lived in Germany for a decade and have got 'fuck you stares' for things as simple as parking in a public place where I was not a resident. Actually in front of my own home while in my car many times. I've got curious stares when I go to a part of India where I'm not originally from. There is a difference between curiosity and what the fuck are you doing in my backyard kind of a stare.  I just visited Bhutan and I got stared at as well out of curiosity but I can always tell the difference. Please do some justice to that free education that you enjoy here.
germany,fdqqbbg,t1_fdq3qhq,1578672591.0,There are culturally sensitive Germans. But quite a few are lazy and stick with stereotypes when they encounter strangers and are shameless in spouting nonsense related to same stereotypes. Exhibit A is the comment to which you replied. This is my assessment after a decade of living here and speaking the language and going about my business. You can usually tell apart genuine curiosity about your culture and judgemental behaviour. These things can be perceived without confusion coming from all races and cultures. From my experience many Germans struggle with social interaction with different cultures because they lack the capacity to navigate complexity in that realm.

Kerala,f7kufp4,t3_dvd7f5,1573826184.0,"In most of these car vs bus/truck accidents you see that the front of the car slides under the bus and that's when the casualties are maximum.

Cars have a crash member in front of body frame to absorb the brunt of impacts and collapse while preserving the structural integrity of the rest of the frame, in order to best protect the passenger compartment. When two cars collide head on the crash members align so it is not as deadly. The impact is absorbed better and the passenger compartment has a better chance to remain intact.

&#x200B;

When a car collides with a bus though both their respective crash members are at different heights and the crash member of the bus goes above that of the car and the passenger compartment is pulverized.

Maybe an SUV can get around this issue because their clearance from the road(average height) is more, so there is less chance of such grisly accidents. Again, rich(relatively speaking) people can afford safety(SUVs airbags and what not) and probably are in a position to give more importance to it.

PS. Airbags would have mattered little seeing the pictures of the accidents

Celiac,ey4el96,t1_ey43fel,1566789796.0,"Ofc yoga is not magical. But there is a science/principles behind Hatha Yoga which is what is modified and marketed in the west as hot yoga and other types of yoga. I'd love to suggest some reading but I'm not that knowledgeable about the source. I've read commentaries about different kinds of yoga most of which has nothing to do with the physical practise of Hatha Yoga. Why I mean to say all this is there is much more depth to these things which the average person like you and me does not and frankly need not delve into unless out of curiosity. Also, a knowledge of Sanskrit is needed to read the original books as it is, though there are many translations. Most of the founding works were written down after being solely transmitted through oral tradition under a teacher for a long, long time. So there are difficulties in interpreting the verse as well sometimes. 

Anyway I agree other physical activities should  be equally good or better if done right. It's just that today's priorities differ. Look at yoga as a product of the climate and times it was developed and it makes more sense. It was developed by people who at their time spent their time contemplating the nature of truth and so on. It was a way to be healthy to pursue ""liberation of the soul"". I hardly have a good understanding of all that(there are enough books on the subject) so I put it in quotes ;). I read recently that a Hatha Yogis objective is physical health and longevity. Considering how it's exercises are relatively impact free on joints as compared to running or weight training it makes sense. But that's just my own conclusion.

Sorry about all this extra info. I just go on these long monologues sometimes. Take what you need from all this. Peace."
Celiac,ey1rpoo,t3_cusr39,1566708736.0,"Who knows something like yoga might help in alleviating symptoms with other chronic illnesses. Not sure about coeliac. I have a story about childhood respiratory problems. Had cold and a runny nose for about a couple of years. Almost every other week when I was around 10-12 years old. Tried nasal drops from Pfizer, Tiger Balm, steam inhalation. Nothing really worked. Funny thing was sometimes it was allergic so antihistamines helped bit sometimes it was just a regular cold. Anyway, It always came back. Ended up with the ENT saying I needed surgery in my ear canal because the fluid backed up through the eustachian tube and my hearing was impaired. Somebody suggested Pranayama and Yoga to my parents as improving respiratory health. I was enrolled for a kids course which taught basics of both and had their own breathing exercise routine. That was for a week. I continued practise every day. Within a month no more cold. Went for a checkup for my ear after two more weeks. Everything fine as far as my hearing was concerned. I think I got a cold only twice or thrice again in the twenty years since. I kid you not. I have other chronic illnesses though like IBS and probably Coeliac(didn't get diagnosed yet). So it's not a Panacea."
