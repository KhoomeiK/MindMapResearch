Silver was deemed to be too pure so vampires could't be reflected off of them due to their impurity. These days mirrors are made with aluminium and other metals which aren't pure so a vampire could definitely see themselves with a mirror now.

If you give it some thought then it makes sense that a vampire would definitely be able to see their reflection in water and many other liquids but not gold.

OCPoetry,f1hcs5a,t1_f1hbfwd,1569490654.0,Thanks. I did feel that the first stanza wasn't as well constructed as the rest. The poem is written to be more of a confession to myself than to others. As a way to recount the details before setting it in stone. Your comment on the line about apathy is very useful and I'll try to keep that in mind th next time I feel like writing.
OCPoetry,f1gv63j,t3_d9fl49,1569478490.0,I did post this on tumblr ([https://jane-meki-jane.tumblr.com/](https://jane-meki-jane.tumblr.com/)) originally. Was curious of what people on this subreddit would say about it.
OCPoetry,f1gtzhx,t1_f1gpj43,1569477278.0,"You could try and give it a title that insinuates repetition. I'm not sure of the exact specifics you could put in the title but I feel that repetition is definitely the sort of path you could take with it and would suite nicely with  the idea of recurring episodes. Not that mixed episodes are nice to experience. I would like to say that it does take a fair amount of effort to read the poem as it isn't presented in a particular pattern or structure throughout. It can be frustrating to some readers to the point  that they don't finish reading the poem.  I don't think you should change this aspect though because I personally like how it feels spontaneous and therefore go well with the general meaning but it is something you should still keep in mind. 

Non feedback related, I can relate to this poem very deeply. I write sad poems on tumblr about my life all the time and sometimes share it here. My most recent one was simply called ""I'm depressed but I won't tell anyone"" and describes how I'm depressed and won't tell anyone. So i'm not that much better at titles than you are. I hope we both overcome our struggles eventually."
OCPoetry,f1grp33,t3_d9cep1,1569475168.0,"There is not much I could say about this poem because I personally think it's nicely brief and descriptive. However the lines (1) ""The heart-shaped places water"" and (2) ""Might then settle for a spell"" do feel a little out of place. *PERSONALLY (*emphasis on personally because it is just my opinion*)* it feels as though you stopped to start a different story and then suddenly shifted on track again. This is more so for the 2nd line I pointed out rather than the 1st but i thought to just mention both of them as it seems you wrote this poem with each set of 2 lines holds a meaning together."

overcoming,exk2u27,t3_ctbc9z,1566370215.0,Now this is only my opinion but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion of depression so quickly. You should take your time. What you described about what's happened does make sense to lead to depression though. I'm no expert so my advice isn't perfect and it's more of a suggestion really. You could try and find a hobby and/or get to know people of similar interests.

OCPoetry,ex1ejb6,t3_cr2xn2,1565941690.0,"I can really relate to this poem's theme. The only thing I would give advice on is the first stanza (paragraph). After reading it many times it feels as though you were focused on making it rhyme rather than pushing the meaning, but I could be wrong and those words do make sense to you which is fine. I can see what the purpose of the poem is and I write poems with similar purposes but possibly just with my own personal experiences projected within the words."
OCPoetry,ewxg9fq,t1_ewxfntn,1565856206.0,Yes those changes do sound beneficial. I often wonder If I'm giving good advice at all when responding to different peoples poems because I know that it is only my personal opinion. I have my own  style and preferences and so does everyone else so I always try to make sure people don't forget that the poem is of their creation and not mine so what happens next is their choice. I believe that by being part of this subreddit my job is only to give the author a perspective other than their own so they can experiment with what I  have said. I hope that I was able to do the same for you.
OCPoetry,ewxf18p,t1_ewxc3i8,1565854950.0,"I think that this poem requires being read multiple times in order to properly understand the story line because of how cryptic it is. It doesn't need to be clear but I would like to point out how there wasn't really a justification for why one of the group left. I don't think that is bad but from the perspective of a reader it can cause confusion and an unsatisfactory feeling. This is because of a sudden shift in focus. At first the focus was on the ""person"" who acted differently and then it changes to how the group is reacting to that person after they disappeared. I do think all the stanzas (paragraphs) were written very well it might just be a little too long. I personally think that to get the full effect of uncertainty or ""forever"" then it should be just a little bit more brief. This is only the advice I can give you and in the end this is your poem so it is your choice to change anything and you don't have to."
OCPoetry,ew3fgch,t3_clw5lh,1565076241.0,"This is my most recent poem on my tumblr blog ([http://jane-meki-jane.tumblr.com/](http://jane-meki-jane.tumblr.com/)) and I was just wondering if anybody got some advice on pace. The first stanza feels like it moves quite slowly whereas the second stanza feels like it moves very quickly. It should work with the theme of this poem but I feel as though it's a little forced. I'm not sure.

# I SURVIVED TODAY

I got out of bed today  
For once in a while  
I felt okay  
Yesterday I was in pain  
There was so much pounding  
Inside my brain  
Last night I could barely sleep  
I twitched and turned my feet  
As I spent so many hours  
Counting sheep

So now I’m heading to class  
And I can’t waste this feeling  
While it currently lasts  
Oh this is so much better   
Than in my recent past  
But oh dear  
Time just moves way too fast  
Now it’s the end  
Of my perfect day  
And tomorrow might not  
Be the same"

OCPoetry,evexc6d,t1_evewd7e,1564482223.0,"No worries. I think I should have been more explicit as to why it felt like a recount of a true story because being vague isn't always too helpful. I guess that it's because around the end you started addressing the love interest directly as though it was a special message meant for them and for me that just makes the most sense if the dream was real. Maybe in between that part and the part of the poem before that you could try and add a detail or so just to make it more clear that one part is about the dream and the other part is about reality. That's just a suggestion of cause, your poem should stay true to how you want it to be and how you feel."
OCPoetry,eveulxw,t1_evehcf5,1564479493.0,"You know what, I really love the imagery you used. It does feel repetitive though not that by doing so it is bad. I think that by treating Life and Death as people, you create a story and characters that real people can relate to."
OCPoetry,evepd85,t3_cjaa7m,1564474263.0,"Honestly this poem has a very sweet vibe. I don't have much to say other than it sticks to the main theme and story line very well. However the first line talks about this being a dream but throughout the rest of the poem it feels like a recount of a true story. I'm not saying that it's a bad way to write a poem I was just wondering if this was what you where aiming for. I do like how there appears to be two people fighting over the chance to sing with someone they love but then it shows that the love interest them self continues to be happy and cheerful. It is also nice how ""two might as well be three"" is showing that the three people except each other in a way."
OCPoetry,eveobkm,t3_cjlni5,1564473208.0,"I really think that this poem is written very nicely. The first stanza (paragraph) does well to introduce the reader to the symptoms of an anxiety attack. The second stanza cleverly describes how a person feels as they loose control of what's happening. The third stanza shows that the person having a the anxiety attack is becoming desperate as they try hard to control their arms. I personally really like how this poem that you have composed doesn't have some kind of happy ending or resolution, as seen in the last stanza. Instead it gives you a similar feeling of watching an epic fight seen in a movie but with no sound or with sound but no image. It is hard to describe the exact feeling but I think that you get the general idea. Explicitly stating that anxiety is the enemy at the end adds a nice finishing touch. All in all very good work"

introvert,epghcnv,t3_bundbm,1559213466.0,"Maybe you can try and show her that you like being alone. Maybe read a funny book that'll make you laugh out loud. Maybe you should let her read  ""Quiet: the power of introverts in a world that can't stop speaking"" which might help her to understand why you changed so much. A lot of people might not quite understand how you feel if you tell them directly and explicitly because it completely contradicts there understanding of how things should be and that may lead them to think your lying. Remember that you can't change a persons mind, only the person themselves can do that. You have to set up evidence for them to realize that they may be wrong and then adjust their belief accordingly."

Anxiety,epa59wb,t1_eoz34qr,1559122140.0,I understand how I can be a perfectionist in that sense. It also boils down to how much I want the potential good outcome.

I have failed at many things in the past but only because I tried to complete the task I need to do which is only because I had the motivation for.

In my case it always feels like a lose-lose situation."
