Depends: If we're talking islam then i'll probably get banned as i believe it is the most vicious concept every conceived. 

So lets assume you're saying i have an anti christian bias. I was baptized catholic six months after birth and my practicing catholic family members (paternal grandparents) were very nice people. My name and my brother's names the names of christian saints. Altho i've made a concious decision to be agnostic in my beliefs i dont think i've left the church. Unless i'm excommunicated by order of the Pope in Rome ill be registered as a catholic as long as i live. So letd get that out of the way.



>You'll just go ""muh Inquisition, muh Wars of Religion, muh Reformation""

I don't think think the christian faith itself is responsible for those conflicts. The faith is one thing and people who follow it are another. Wars are fought by people. What i was saying is that religion has been used as an excuse by people (who dont represent god and chirst in any way shape or form because they were mortals) to wage wars that were percentually bloodier than modern wars.

>Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Literally everything I listed was born out of a visceral hatred of religion and anything having to do with it.

People hated the ones that used religion to fuck with other people. Not the concept of religion, but how badly it has been abused. There are churches today that are comparable to big corporations. Preaching shit that its not even in the bible and charging money from the ""flock"". The rise of secularism came from the natural desire of men to express himself freely and not be controlled by anyone else. It is benign. 

>Marxism hates religion.

True. But marxism is a dogmatic retarded ideology created to control people. Its a cult. You cant blame secularism for marxism. Secular thought brought way more good ideas than bad ideias.

>And you know that the whole monarchy system is not independent of religion, like the whole ""the king derives power from God and is a divine agent"" thing, right? If you hate religion you're gonna go kill/depose the king.

The monarchy derives its power from the fact they command an army, a government and enourmous wealth and normal people don't have that. The whole ""divine right to rule"" is what european's nobles used to legitimize themselves from the 500s to the 1700s. But by no means that was the thing keeping them in power. They were in power as long as they made the system work. When a monarch was hated he was overthorwn by another who took his place, or by peasants that had zero idea on how to run a country and were massacred by the other monarch's armies.

>Not all secularists are marxists but all marxists are secularists.

Yep, not all christians fought in the crusades but all crusaders were christians. Meaning absolutely nothing.

>, neither secularists nor bolsheviks believe in an objective moral standard -- Morality comes from God, if there is no God, there is no moral standards... except for what the oh-so-benign state (be it Communist China or the UN or Secular Sweden) imposes

Morality develops in any community in order for said community to work. Lets take african villages for example. If one dude goes raping all the women than that dude is causing problems. So the villagers gather and kill said dude or bannish him. Morality comes naturally because human society does not work without it.

>Also pretty much no human society ever has been irreligious (for long, at least...) if not at gunpoint.

Alright here is the thing: Humans need to believe in stuff that they cannot verify. Yes we live ""without religion"" im the west,  but people make up their own ""truths"". A housewife reads on tv that giving supermakertmilk to an infant is bad. So she creates the belief that she should breastfeed. Donald Trump says hes going to fix the US. No one knows but people belief it to be true and vote for him. We need to believe in things we cannot prove. This is religion. There is no proof of god, but people believe. There is no proof that marxism works, but idiots believe. We never lived without religion because everything is religion. 90% of what you believe you have been convinced to believe.


I wrote this more for myself than to answer you, because the way you spoke made me it clear you are a chirstian and the entire basis of my argument is comming from an agnostic standpoint.

So in my view the problem is not a lack of religion, but the fact that the sychos are running the show. As they tend to be fierce atheists and devout marxists people assume thats why its all going down. The problem does not lie in the lack of god, it lies in the lack of common sense.

If the source is a video called: 10 badass one man army last stands than its probably full of dubious info. 

Since this is not r/askhistorians i wont bother to say more about sources. But i will say this:

It's extremely unlikely that a single individual could defeat more than 4 others in physical combat. Yes even if he is a total badass. Why? In video games and movies enemies take turns to attack. In real life you'd be attacked by everyone at the same time and due to being sourrounded all your training wouldnt matter in that situation. You'd die pretty easily.

 Also good fighters tended not to get sourrounded in the first place, and if they did they would surrender to live another day (yes including Samurai, who would surrender just to proceed to take his own life). 

If we're talking about gun combat i'd say its possible to fight against 10 people and win, assuming you are highly trained and is in a position where you can't be outflanked. There are accounts of last stands in armed combats that are mindblowing. Most of them dont have video documentation because who would be filming that? The guy worried about 20 dudes? Those 20 dudes?

Most people can't. They have intuition but its hard to know for sure. We are better at being false and deceiving other people than at being true, genuine and charismatic.

 Thats why you see loads of coaches and videos and buisnesses focused on helping people being charismatic and friendly and overcoming social anxiety and almost none about learning how to decieve and lie.

I'm a student of International Relations (diplomacy) and by hobby a history buff. All i've learned led me to believe humans are really good at being mean and no so much at being nice. That's evolution. Altho in 10,000 years we've created a complex civilization with a complex morality system the natural evolution of the human species changed little. What separates you from a prehistoric man or woman is more knowlege and more civilized beliefs, but deep down you have the same basic instincts. Back then it paid off to be mean and being nice could get you killed. We've evolved for millions of years to learn how to decieve, lie and be agressive in order to survive. It comes naturally.
Being nice and charismatic and funny and eloquent is not intuitive to the homo sapiens, """"goodness"" is learned. Of course you can desbelieve all of this because altho i love the subject, i'm no certified expert. But it comes from a long time of study. 

Hence why i think people can conceal emotions with ease and actors need to dramatize everything to let us know what's up.

You'd be very surprised how people are able to believe a character is actually real. In my country we have something called Novela, which is tv series but it has a new chapter every work day, runs for half a year, and the plot changes based on popularity polls of the characters (albeit the results are not open to the public as to not ruin the whole thing). Anyway, some Novela actors and actresses have bee verbally and even physically attacked in their everyday lives because of something their character did in the Novela.

Of course that is not the majority of people, especially in the US, but many people are so immersed in a performance that they end up believing its a real thing. 

Of course its harder to have this level of immersion if we're talking an actual theater with stage plays, but my post is about TV acting (movies and series)"

I believe an actor is lying to the audience to make said audience believe he is not an actor, but the character that he is playing. If i pretend to be someone else, i'm deceiving (a.k.a lying). I could be doing this to cause harm or to cause good. Actors do it to cause good (i.e great performances for the audience) 

>When acting, you have to exaggerate your expressions. 

Precisely my point of view. Acting situations are different from real life situations because actions and emotions are exaggerated.

changemyview,fqdihjm,t1_fqddevk,1589290393.0,"Yes, but my view is that acting is way more exaggerated than what happens in real situations. 

I know different people react differently to situations, my example was myself but feel free to think of another.

Lots of videos and memes and even reddit discussions poke fun of acting in the vein of ""Movie X IRL"" or ""Real life situation X in a movie"" or even ""Things that happen in movies that are b.s IRL""

>my antidepressants didn't dull my emotions when i was taking them, so maybe we have different perspectives.
