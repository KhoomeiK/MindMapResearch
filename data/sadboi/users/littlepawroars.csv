My advice is to take the time you need to decide what you want, specifically identify and reinforce your boundaries and determine what resources you will need to achieve your goal (therapy, leaving, moving out, or couples counseling etc). 

Naturally, every moment you keep this to yourself can feel emotionally draining so find a trustworthy person to vent/process/ brainstorm ideas with. This way, when you take action it isn‚Äôt overwhelming and ‚Äúfresh‚Äù so to speak.

He gets mad and fights with you because you are calling him out and he is trying to make his problem your fault. A dead bedroom before being married is a HUGE no! You don‚Äôt deserve to ve tied down to someone so incredibly selfish! 

I too thought that I was being shallow because outside the bedroom things seemed great. In the end, my ex was cheating and treated me worse and worse because I would keep bringing up my dissatisfaction with how little sex and affection I was getting. 

He basically ended up confessing to me that he couldn‚Äôt get hard with me or real people and he needed porn to get aroused and climax. 

When we did have sex it wasn‚Äôt intimate and I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. He didn‚Äôt care about my pleasure, left me hanging more than pleased me and he acted like our bad sex was ALL on me (I wasn‚Äôt exciting enough, skinny enough or kinky enough). If I didn‚Äôt do him like a porn star he would go limp immediately.

But honestly it wasn‚Äôt good at all! I have yet to meet a man in rl who has effeminate characteristics who isn‚Äôt toying around with women‚Äôs emotions and confused about their own sexual preferences. 

My last two exes were like this. Ex husband pestered me to stick toys up his ass. He ended up  being a raging alcoholic and a cheater. 

Then right after him I dated my ex bf. Now this guy is really messed up! He is porn sick, violent tendencies (assaulted me when we ended) and definitely a controlling, sexually frustrated closeted bisexual. I wouldn‚Äôt of cared if he liked both sexes but just him being super fake and judgemental of gay dudes while checking dudes out was a huge red flag.
