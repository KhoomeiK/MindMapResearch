AskReddit,fc2xo8k,t3_efqzp6,1577376780.0,My fiancé got drunk and told me how upset he was that the woman he had an emotional affair with earlier this year stoped talking to him and got a boyfriend.
JustNoSO,fbb53jy,t3_eceuou,1576693489.0,"My fiancé and I are going through something similar. We’ve been together 8 years and got engaged 2 years ago. That was about the time I started to notice changes in his behavior. He started to become more depressed and distant. I later found out he was having an emotional affair with a co worker. We’re trying to work through things, but his mood swings are so hard to deal with. At night he becomes so agitated and he twists everything I say to him so he thinks I’m bad mouthing him and trying to make him feel bad. And then he’s sweet and loving and apologetic in the morning. I hope you get some answers."

sad,f70kr6o,t3_dtrg69,1573329522.0,"This made me tear up. We lost our beagle girl almost 3 years ago and I still find myself waiting for her at times. It gets easier, but I still cry when I’m missing her. Much love to you during this hard transition in your life."
depression,ez5s5dq,t1_ez5qwij,1567704104.0,"Thank you. That is something that I and I’m sure many others deal with, is the pressure or social obligation to have some kind of response when someone opens up like that. I’m slowly learning to just be supportive, but when I suggest trying to move on to something they might enjoy or even trying to sleep when it’s 2am, I worry that he will think I’m just trying to change the subject or just move on and bury it."
depression,ez5r19a,t1_ez5plwj,1567703405.0,That’s what I’m trying to do but it’s hard. My biggest fear is him leaving because he “doesn’t want to hurt me anymore” I just don’t understand that and wish he could see how much I want to support him through this no matter what.
depression,ez5eqhb,t3_d01jay,1567698595.0,"I’m struggling with this with my fiancé. He is struggling with depression and feeling numb. He’s trying to open up to me, but a lot of things he says scare me because I can’t imagine feeling that low and that bad all the time and I literally don’t know what to say to help or if there is even anything. 
Last night we were up until maybe 1am talking and he kept repeating how alone and horrible he felt and that he doesn’t think he can go on and and do this much longer and that terrifies me. I don’t what I can/should do to help. Is there anything? Probably not."
drycleaning,ex2f1p8,t3_cr79pc,1565968262.0,"I know of a mail in cleaning service based in Kansas City called Arrow specialty cleaners. I manage a dry cleaners and I have seen several items say only send to Arrow cleaners. I have never personally used them since we aren’t affiliated with them and I’m not sure if my customers ever followed through and sent their items in or not, but it might be worth a try.

n64,esl7za8,t3_c89faj,1562080879.0,"Definitely Diddy Kong. For me as a kid it was more fun to play solo as I had an older brother who would never play with me unless our mom made him. I liked the cute characters and all the mini games and challenges. It was enough to keep my busy for hours. Even when I play them now I still prefer Diddy Kong. I usually only play Mario Kart because everyone else wants to play that. I still enjoy Mario Kart, but Diddy Kong holds a special place in my heart."
