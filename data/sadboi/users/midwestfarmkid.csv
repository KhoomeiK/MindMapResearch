therapy,fqemia4,t3_gid0b6,1589310013.0,"Wow, first of all, I am so sorry your parents would violate your personal space like that and then have the audacity to hold it against you. That kind of selfishness blows my mind. You are entitled and allowed to feel what you feel, and they have no place minimizing your feelings into something to hold above your head for their own benefit. Sounds unhealthy on their part.

As for the journaling, I haven’t found anything more helpful for me. It is the only place where I can spell out exactly what I want to say, how I want to say it, in as many words as I want to say it. It has been a place where I can explain what I feel in my own terminology and not feel the need to break it down for someone else when it feels very raw.

If you are comfortable, I would absolutely keep journaling if you can. Hide it would be the first option, or if that is not an option, use code words or phrases for things so that it is not as obvious for someone who might be nosy and think your feelings are their domain. Perhaps keep an online journal somewhere? Keep a journal in something that doesn’t look like a “journal.” Prioritize your feelings and keep writing if it offers you a relief. You deserve that."
mentalillness,fqelgwz,t3_gih5m4,1589309523.0,"This is incredible for you. When you say you click on a fundamental level, this is a feeling that has to be unmatched in conversation and truly relieving to experience. I am very happy for you and I hope this understanding in your friendship helps you in more ways that we understand!"
therapy,fqejfha,t3_gid47l,1589308550.0,"I totally agree with the “feelings are feelings” statement. It is good not bad that you feel upset, uncomfortable, jealous, and betrayed, you just feel those things. And it is just fine to feel those things. While it is true that you don’t own your FWB or their actions, it is a normal reaction to a friend violating a level of trust you might have established. It does seem like your sister and your friend both have reacted to your emotions in a way that prioritizes their emotions over yours in a situation that affects you directly. That in itself is very frustrating. So good and bad? Not necessarily. Irrational? Also not true."
therapy,fqe9rdp,t3_gieb9a,1589304052.0,"Hey there - first and foremost, NEVER be sorry about using lots of words or a long post. It is so important to use as many words as you feel like are necessary to explain what you feel to the best of your ability. Everything you say is important, especially when it comes to your mental health. Why else would you say it? So thank you for sharing this, sincerely.

I (24F) don't know if I can tell you exactly where to look for a therapist or how to go about it (depends on your location, financial ability, schedule, etc.) but I can tell you it is HARD to get over preconceived ideas about therapy. Society tells us that seeing a therapist is bad, worrying about your own mental health is selfish, and that a ""strong"" person can get over it themselves. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. Thinking about your own mental health is one of the MOST important things you can do, and you are already doing the right thing by even leaving a post on reddit and asking for advice.

Looking for a therapist when you don't know where to start is *absolutely* mentally and emotionally exhausting. It's like being put in a boat on a lake and handed a fishing pole. They tell you to catch a fish when A) you don't know where to find the fish, B) you don't know how to use the fishing pole, and C) you're afraid of the water. It's this big menu full of options when you can't even understand the menu. And yes, it is discouraging trying to navigate finding a good therapist and handling rejection all at once when you're at a low point in your life. There's not a lot of empathy when it comes to the process of finding someone.

For my own personal experience and dark trouble with depression, I was very much in your shoes when thinking about getting a therapist. An unsupportive family, boyfriend, and community made me feel like I was an absolute failure for wanting help. I had to go through a few therapists that I found via Google search and email, and I still don't even think I've found the *perfect* one yet (it takes work, I'm not going to lie). But what I will tell you is that you are doing the BEST thing you can do for yourself. I know it seems scary to talk to a therapist because they might ""judge"" you, but just know that they understand that once you reach out, they know you want to get help.

They know you are making the first step towards getting better. They know you are coming as you are, with whatever bags you carry or problems you hold. They know you aren't perfect, and that you've had a hard time coping. They know you are hurting or scared. And they *want* to help. Most therapists enter the field because they *know* they can help *you.* They want to hear what you have to say and they want to listen. I'm not going to sugarcoat and say all the preconceived notions went away and I told everyone I know about going to therapy, but dipping my toe outside of my fear and finally going to one (even though my first visit was pretty much just me crying the whole time) is something that I know is helping just a little bit, visit by visit. My therapists visits are a secret I keep for myself for now, letting it work for me on my own schedule, and I will share when I feel that it is necessary or relevant to others. But they have no say in how I want myself to feel, and you are *absolutely* entitled to building up your own mental health on your own terms. 

Even though I don't know you, and as someone who feels the shoes you are in, ***I am proud of you*** for reaching out. I would always be happy to talk to you more. Helping other people gives me life, and you are strong whether you know it or not."
Agriculture,fq0lvzn,t3_geu4mk,1589034043.0,"From my experience working with quite a few different agricultural companies and cooperatives (USA), most of the precision ag techs (or I am assuming you mean anyone who works precision ag at a field-level position) are hired by Agronomy Managers and Precision Ag Managers. I would look into jobs like Agronomy Sales, Precision Ag Specialists, and Crop Consultants/Specialists to respond and ask who their hiring manager would be. Precision ag has really worked its way into *most* agricultural careers at this point, and even if you can’t find EXACTLY what you’re looking for, I think you’ll get pretty close. LinkedIn is fine."
Agriculture,eqb6zi4,t1_epa8foa,1559945755.0,"I don't know if I would single out mid-level farms as those who are struggling most based on marketing strategy. Mid-level farmers might have a more difficult time because they are aiming to make farming a full time job, but might not have *quite* enough acres to make it pencil with a family living withdrawal. Smaller farmers often have outside jobs and farm on evenings and weekends to make it work. Smaller farmers also most of the time have smaller, older equipment that they aren't still making payments on (though 98% they are fully depreciated pieces of equipment), while mid-range farmers are still trying to keep up trading in 6-year old tractors with rising engine hours and looking for newer. Smaller farms in the midwest (crops that are in the heart of this tariff bailout) rarely (seriously) have a CSA or direct marketing scheme. We're just not quite in a part of the world that sustains that model like cities do. I mean of course there's a little of that, but proportionally WAY less. Usually those smaller farmers don't have the storage infrastructure to play the markets like mid-level and large farms do, and would have to sell to local elevators at price du jour.

Also, larger farms don't exactly have ""shareholders"" and ""top level execs"" - only if they're running the farm like a true corporation. That's very rarely the case in most large farms. Many of the large farms I deal with and work with are multi-generational family-owned business who have built farms through smart money management, years of building up land bases, good marketing, and quite often being in the right place at the right time. Now, I'm not saying that I agree with the monocrop system that subsidies drive, or how input prices have decreased farm profitability when they skyrocketed with $7 corn in the mid 00's and never came back down when crop prices tanked (different story for a different day) ..... there are so many angles you could take this conversation ..... but I would say small farmers probably hurt just as much or more as mid-range farmers. Volume is king in ag right now. And everything is proportional."
TheNSPDiscussion,eq4wpep,t1_eq4v1y3,1559787785.0,OH. This makes so much more sense. I feel dumb now.
TheNSPDiscussion,eq4updl,t1_eq4osfr,1559786382.0,"Sorry - all I meant was that were you implying that the main character was acting in a ""vegetarian"" way by refusing to participate in cannibalism therefore being more humane, or that he was *literally* a vegetarian, also being humane? I don't really want to drag eating habits into this, I just didn't see where you were going with that."
TheNSPDiscussion,eq4ny29,t1_eq4jvok,1559781164.0,Serious question: did you mean that literally or figuratively?
TheNSPDiscussion,eq4go7y,t1_epujmzd,1559776470.0,"I agree so, so much. All of the excitement of getting to Whitefall and what was ahead really was washed out by what actually transpired there. I know it's difficult to cover ALL aspects of what actual survival would be like in a month living in a fairly bleak bus shelter, but how am I supposed to believe that those oft-mentioned vending machines had enough food to split up for several weeks between approx. 70 people for them not to die in a few weeks? All these people had to have remarkable self-control... why didn't someone just wig out and eat everything in their ""camp"" one night? Know what I mean?

Also, I feel that a lot of the early on hostility was a little unwarranted. I understand some people are darker than others in terms of disposition (this is the NSP...duh), but why so much hostility towards other people if you know you're only going to be stuck in a bus station for a night or two, initially of course. Sure, you can be irritated, but I felt that attitude was a little to harsh too sudden. And then there's the annoying heroism of the Kris (Chris?) shunning cannibalism until the very end. Yes, he made the point about keeping your humanity, but when you have been STARVING for a MONTH I don't know how much of a humanitarian you would be. It felt a little forced.

I love the NSP, I have listened to every single episode they have, and have done so religiously.. But I just felt underwhelmed by this season. Maybe I've just exhausted myself on horror podcasts/writing and I've become either too desensitized or too big of a critic. Like everyone says, I definitely didn't hate it, it just wasn't a favorite."
