I didn’t mind it. Lost interest when he started “rating pps” just because the humor didn’t appeal to me, yet it somehow applied to the entire subreddit and they think it’s hilarious. I feel like Felix thinks he has to keep this humor up to keep his audience. Imo it’s only a matter of time before he needs another break."

PrequelMemes,fj3f133,t1_fj31bws,1582981344.0,"The sequels do a great job at a lot of things. The most frustrating thing that people hate is that two directors decided to play tug of war with the trilogy. JJ should’ve tried to adapt to TLJ opposed to trying to scrap it completely. Still, I enjoy a lot of aspects of it. Music is great, the movies *look* stunning, and the actors are all doing a really good job for the most part. Yes I would’ve rather had Disney not do these movies, but we can’t change the past. I’d give it 10 years or so until they start the prequelmemes cycle: people ironically make memes about the prequels until they fall in love with the movies and unironically enjoy them."
