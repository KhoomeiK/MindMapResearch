First few years after leaving I'd visit during Christmas at least, but as time went on and getting further away it got more expensive to travel back, and the further I got, the more different I got, too; so much so that the annual visits got a little less...friendly, I suppose.

Last time I was there, four years ago this Christmas, a rift between me and my family was cut the deepest it'd ever been. However, I had the random opportunity to reunite with old high school friends and had a much better time with them. Also skipped out a couple days with my wife and kid to Asheville; was the most fun we had. 

Mostly it was a reminder - to me, at least - you can't ever really go home again. I have many, many happy memories and warm feelings for the Triangle; but also some very dark, sad things that have yet to be resolved - if ever. 

Current residence has an uncomfortable, but doable cost-of-living and we're looking at heading east to somewhere, just not sure. We've considered Asheville, or Wilmington, but would likely not be in NC. Which makes me sad. I want to want to go back, but...it's just not there.

But there is a lot I do miss."
