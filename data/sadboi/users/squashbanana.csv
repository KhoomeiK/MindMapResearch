As for Dean sleeping with Gayle, my theory was sort of rooted in the writers having us find out when Beth did.

Just kidding, don't do that. As a woman who has been married for nearly 10 years with 2 kids, you need to ask yourself if you want to raise kids with a man who calls his partner disgusting for ANYTHING, first of all, let alone something entirely natural. Also, in marriage and with kids (if that's your bag), he's gonna see some shit. Literally. My husband watched my compacted colon basically release the kraken all over our tub in my third trimester with our first kid. I was so apologetic, and the man CLEANED IT UP HIMSELF without a single shaming remark so I could rest.

I understand that is a unique circumstance, but my point is also that I've been in relationships with the man who's shamed me for similar things. And in hindsight, now in my 30s, I can see that any man who would speak to you like that over something so absurdly accidental (instead of just fucking cleaning it up or getting new sheets and doing what he can to ease your embarrassment) is only going to set you up for more wasted time at the expense of your self esteem.
