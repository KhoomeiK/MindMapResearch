WhitePeopleTwitter,fqnqxo8,t1_fqnqitl,1589499752.0,"Good point. Unfortunately I feel like there’s a larger emphasis on masks than hand washing and disinfecting surfaces when we should be emphasizing all of it. On twitter there’s a bunch of people talking about the importance of wearing masks and I was talking to a couple of them and I asked if they also wash hands a lot and clean surfaces. They both said the same thing: I wear a mask, but don’t really worry too much about other things. They figure their house is clean despite not disinfecting surfaces"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fqnol81,t1_fqm22bi,1589498617.0,"I see people pulling their masks down and scratching their face all the time though. And if they have covid and are asymptomatic, whatever they touched at home (including their own clothes, car keys, hands and everything) would be another transmission source wouldn’t it? Its like “well I put on this mask with my hands that also touched my car keys before touching my face.”  

Considering this can live on surfaces for days, I just wonder how effective masks are. Can’t hurt I guess. I wouldn’t mind wearing one. Just don’t want a false sense of security"
iPadPro,fqlje5f,t1_fqks6fn,1589459640.0,I’m pretty sure its a 11. You can tell by the aspect ratio. The 11 has more of a widescreen look and the 12.9 looks taller

Doom eternal is a solid sequel too. Some important things like your chainsaw to get more life and ammo? That recharges like you’re grenades now! So you always have more ammo cause you can just chainsaw, wait for it to recharge and chainsaw again. No more looking for gas cans.

I’m also in Washington (Tacoma) and we are seeing food shortages already. My mom who is elderly and disabled has meds on back order because they cant be filled right now. 33 million people are unemployed and as we’ve seen from the past, a depression has an utterly terrible impact on society.
