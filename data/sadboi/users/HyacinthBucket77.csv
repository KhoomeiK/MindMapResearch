It's harder than I think it should be, I dunno. But I do wish I had one more moment with him to kiss the top of his furry little head."

However... some folks make it impossible to love them because they put up walls and leave relationships because they don't think they are worthy. But we all are.. we all deserve love and need to open up ourselves and realize that love is extremely difficult and not what others pretend it is on Instagram or how it's portrayed in the movies...it takes work."
femalefashionadvice,f0nmh7l,t1_f0lmdb2,1568774028.0,Just went down a pinterest rabbit hole looking for affordable hiking boots like the Woolrich ones you pinned. Perfection! And the wrap with burgundy grey and black stripe is going to haunt me. Any idea where it's from?
