I work at a hub store. A hub basically means, for the most part, more parts because they transfer all kinds of stuff to sister stores nearby. However, as you know, they dont always have certain things in stock. This is because the sister stores in the area do a lot of orders from the hub stores. So even though we have more it's constantly being transferred to other stores.

Most likely , another regular non, hub store will have it amd they will transfer it to your store. Just ask them to transfer in the missing item from a nearby store to the store you use."

bipolar,fnwp7zo,t1_fnv6or3,1587322725.0,"Wow, thank you very much for your response.
Yes, I have an emotional mind with the speed and intensity of a Ferrari engine with the emotional brakes of a bicycle. I feel everything in full effect and it's hard to slow it down and take a second before I react.

I've also created a bad habit of forming these great relationships and then wearing people down. I'm too much for people sometimes. I understand they're coworkers but I had this great relationship with them and I've managed to sabotage it. I've always had this unrealistic desire for almost everyone to like me. I put a lot of value in people liking me because frankly I don't like myself. So I use them for validation for myself so when theres problems it causes me some distress.

But you're right. I don't take other people's behavior in context. All my coworkers are stressed out like majority of us around the globe are. It's very hard for me to be objective with myself and relationships. I always assume the worst, I always take things personally. 

As I'm typing I realize I need to stop seeking worth and value with external things. I need to find it within myself. I would say to find myself again and be ok with myself again but I don't think I've been there.

I badly need a therapist. I have a psychiatrist who is willing to take some time to do some very light, informal psychotherapy but he's a psychiatrist so he has to kind of talk meds first. I need someone to go to who is safe, fair, guiding and all that good stuff.

I do take meds. Meds are the reason I am where in at. This is my first full time job ever, I'm 24. I've struggled a lot my whole life. But I've kept this full time job for a year. Which is the longest I've been at a job. I used to find that sad. But I am so, idk what word to even describe how thankful and somewhat proud I am. So I do keep that in mind too. I'm still in uncharted waters for myself. The longest I kept a job before was 5 months at a oart time. So it's still very new to me.

Finally, if I try to be fully objective, which is hard because I  think it's worse than this, but I think my coworkers care about me. They don't know I'm bipolar but that I take meds and I haven't always had it easy just like anyone else. I think they're concerned from my somewhat erratic mood swings, I also think they don't know what to do. And that they're more backing up because they don't know what to do and don't wanna make it worse. My mind does want to distort it and go fully to to otherside and say they just don't like me and think I'm crazy. But I've been with them throught their own crazy shit and behavior and I know they appreciate that. So as of 11:57am today, I will believe that line of thinking. I will also explore the links you posted. I'm so glad you posted. You've added to what others have said and it helped a lot. Thank you"

Your first point on others not knowing your struggle is true. My thoughts are so fast and they flood my mind frequently that at times I feel people can read my mind because my thoughts are so loud. I know I don't have it the worst, but I know my struggle is real.

It's funny, I just read all kinds of articles about people not liking you, and more specifically, people who once liked you and may not feel that way anymore. While there was helpful stuff, you're response embodies all those article's main points.

And I am struggling to even keep my head above water. It feels like I always have, but it gets worse at times. How the hell can I  fucking keep all my social relationships a float too. You're damn right, I cant let this consume me because it will be my downfall. I'm depressive right now, and in my personal journey as a man with bipolar disorder, I self destruct, but in an external way unlike, (this is a huge generalization I know) how women internalize things. That means I like to hurt myself and destroy things amd be angry. When really I'm sad, im hurt. 

And I didnt think what you had to say would be what I wanted to hear. But it was. Thank you so very much again. Man, I'm thankful for this community and everyone on it. It would be great if we didnt have this disorder, but sometimes I think we are a different breed, in a mostly good way. Someone shared this passage in a book that basically said, we seem to always be down or up and even when we're up, we're never quite ok. But when shit hits the fan for our friends, family and even our fellow humans with no special relation, disorder or no disorder, we help others rise up, we have this crazy ass ability to help others and be the calm in their storm even if we cannot do it for ourselves.
