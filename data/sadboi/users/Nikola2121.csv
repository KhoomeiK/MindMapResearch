TwinStarExorcists,fef3kli,t3_eosw4p,1579047355.0,"Better start from the beginning. It is not too much to read. The art is great and story goes different way from the early chapters. This is my personal opinion. If you don't want, you can start right after yuuto fight around chapter 20 (not really sure there).

Edit: Chapter 15. You can start from there if you don't want to reread, but I am not sure, if there were differences between anime and manga in earlier chapters."

So much hype for the holy war 3000 years ago, great panels in the manga, archangels vs indra. Disappointment so far. I expect the big fight in S3 to be bad as well..."

This time saying, he is the Seven Deadly Sin's Lion's Sin of Pride Escanor, was the most badass since his introduction. Founding a pride more befitting of a great and wise person, not of a arrogant one (that has his pride for his power). I literally think his character has finished his development. Whatever happens after this, i would be glad with it, the way it is."

NanatsunoTaizai,eonx1la,t1_eonjtmh,1558723680.0,"Ban is fast. He endures a storm that none of the sins could, when they fought dk. Mael could not do a thing against DK. Also I think Mael is a lot stronger than Escanor. Escanor had trouble with Zeldris, even if you consider he took him In the One form. Ban went on par with DK. Dk is stronger but none could go on par with him. Also ban has 1000 years of experience in fighting. We also don't know what his abilities are capable of after the purgatory. Before you say Mael=Meliodas>Escanor (The one), consider what Zeldris said In the fight with Escanor. Also also Meliodas was not at his full in assault mode. And the author meant Mael=Meliodas considering Meliodas was serious. THIS IS MY OWN OPINION.
He also can just wait 1 minute while running and then defeat him, even if this is not enough as he is indeed fast.
Edit:  before some say I am ban fan. I like escanor more than ban, but I think he would lose as ban is this way now."
