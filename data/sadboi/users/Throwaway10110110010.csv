https://basicincome.org/news/2016/11/will-basic-income-cause-inflation/ 

The basic idea and as the article says it depends on implementation, however if you increase the populations buying power, and their willing to spend their new found “free money”, the increase in demand that could cause, would potentially inflate the price. Which means people will fall back below the poverty line because spending the money they are getting is inflating the cost of some of the products they buy. 

Which with my original idea, wouldn’t be a problem. Because the individuals wouldn’t have increased buying power or at least not much

ukpolitics,fqwuu3l,t1_fqwt72f,1589718308.0,"I could be misunderstanding what you are saying, 

Of course there would be a tax increase, if more people are receiving UBI than the current benefits, but the current benefits is paid for by higher taxes on higher earners, if you’re just adding equal amounts of money to those who qualify, its the current system, but with maybe more money and more qualifying people, it’s nothing different and yes it will have to be taken off the top through taxes. 

But there is still the issue of increasing costs because now everyone has x amount of money to spend. People can pay more so companies will try to get them to pay more."

My personal opinion would be that a UBI model without cash going to individuals, this means the prices are less likely to increase because of lack of freedom to choose, there is also less ability to abuse the system and it also means that people who rely on The UBI can’t forego things to have more luxuries and requiring more assistance in the future. I would imagine this would cover rent basic food essentials, and basic utilities. 
We’d keep the current benefits system (but make it better) to give people their freedom to spend how they like without risking starving their children or becoming homeless. 

To cover the costs of that scenario would be an increase to income tax as it would be for everyone not just the people who need it. It would also potentially solve issues with relationship break downs where a reasonably well off couple split but one ends up sleeping rough while things settle.

If the model was in the form of a fix poll tax the poor get poorer and the rich are less effected, which is just not what is needed."

Hopefully this will pass or my psychologist will give me something to help, but I will probably just end up moving back to my parents next month and going back to step 1. Where the mental health team is terrible. 

My advice is find someone to live with that can take you out of bad moods, my housemate likes to go on walks, joining them on those helps. I don’t want to put you off moving out, it can be extremely rewarding, but it can also be the loneliest time. 

Sometimes things will get too much to the point you feel like breaking down but with a few changes and knowledge of yourself that can change, for example I often go on a deep cleaning spree, where I spend hours cleaning every inch of a room, while listening to music. 
On the other hand you have freedom, the ability to have friends visit and cook a meal play games have a few drinks and you don’t have to be continually looking out for things other people want you to do. Everything becomes your choice and that is wonderful. Nobody will shout at you for not hanging your towel up to dry properly.

It’s all about learning how you work yourself, and not having anyone to blame, if you have been depressed and not wanted to do anything and now have no clean clothes to wear, well that’s your fault and you need to at least do your washing even if you don’t feel like it. The same for dishes and vacuuming, but the comfort is that it is my fault, and nobody else made that choice and I have the power and responsibility to fix it, and it isn’t much work.

One last thing, calling hotlines is ok, calling the police in an emergency is where in my experience things can get rocky, the police and mental health professionals have the power to admit you to a hospital if they believe you will be a risk to yourself or someone else. It is a horrible experience, for me it was 4 years ago, and I still haven’t spoken with my father after he called the police he will never be forgiven.

britishproblems,fpt1fia,t1_fpsbumt,1588883199.0,"Theoretically the police would have to prove it wasn’t reasonable, but yes I understand what you are saying.

As you rightly point out the guidance and the law are different, and the interpretation well that’s the same with all law, but in the legislation it specified exercise as a reasonable excuse, and did not specify a quantity or length of time. 

An example a dog owner normally takes their dog out 2 times a day because they’re a very muscular breed, after the guidance that dog would only be taken out once a day instead of twice, even though twice would legally be fine.

britishproblems,fpsl4gq,t1_fpsi5wm,1588875306.0,"This is my point, the actual legislation states you can leave the house with a reasonable excuse, an example of this is exercise.

Boris said once per day, which isn’t mentioned anywhere in the legislation nor is the length of time.

Sturgeon has made this even more confusing, I’m not 100% that the legislation is the same on both sides of the border, but there hasn’t been anything I’ve seen to suggest it is different.

It’s meant that people have ended up thinking They can only go once a day in total, and variations on what the actual rules are.

I’m not saying people should abuse the rules, but simply the knowledge of more freedom if they feel they need it, would help people even if they don’t use the freedom.

Another example is it is perfectly within the law to go out and have a walk with a friend, they don’t want everyone and their dog to do it as it is an increased risk, but as long as you are both out with reason (the exercise) and it is no more than 2 people, it’s actually legal. 

I advocate for this knowledge to be shared because I believe there will be a lot of people suffering with mental health challenges simply because they are following the wrong guidance too strongly, and it is unfair.

There is a mix up between the law and the guidelines and it needs to be made clear with clear language."

I started looking for a relationship about 5 years ago, and I met this guy from Spain, who was over studying, it was near the end of term and our first date was a simple meal out, but this guy said all the right things to me and I had a rush of feelings and impulsive behaviour.

On our second date, he was asking about the best way to get to the airport by train, (it's a couple of hours away and have to change several times) I offered to take him in my car, it'll be faster and cheaper, once he said yes, I started looking at plane tickets, thinking I could do with a holiday.

I found some flights to Madrid (where he was going) and a hotel for a reasonable price, I sent him a text saying can I come to Spain with you for a weekend. I then had a fantastic time with this guy, ended up spending way too much, but the hotel had a spa and we got a great room with a balcony, it was probably the most romantic situation I've ever been in, but it was our 3rd date and I'd only known they guy 3 weeks, I went to a country I've never been to, with a person I don't really know, unable to speak a word of Spanish, we stopped talking to each other after I declared I was in love, and I just wanted to stay with him.

This is certainly not a healthy approach, and you have to know what you can do in what amount of time.

Bare in mind, I was doing a computer science degree, which has a lot of Internet resources available and such. I also aimed for the bare minimum to get the grades, like if the grading guidelines said do x y and z for 80% I would just hit x y and z but not make them fancy or elaborate more than I had to.

From another perspective what I think a healthy thing to do is, book up a specific time slot to do work for each assignment, with a goal to reach by the end of it that session, allow yourself to reschedule once or twice, but you absolutely must reach the deadline before the time you have allocated is up. Feel free to tune in and out I used to watch friends while working, it meant I would spend longer doing it but it was easier to withstand.

I don't think voters are dumb either, but I think they are less informed than they should be, I think most people's view on the election is based on

Who is likely to win? 

Which will do what I want about the current big topic?

A lot of people don't remember the past, I'm 28 the last time Labour were in No. 10 I was 18, I hadn't paid much attention to politics from before then, so I have no real knowledge of the UK under labour and the saddest part of it all is my vote is pointless, because I want to vote for a smaller party but because they have so little following they just won't win. 

I've always read the manifestos since being able to vote but they don't explain in real terms what is actually going to happen, because it's just a list of possible promises. What actually would £450 million get done? Nobody really knows but it sounds like a lot. 

I don't understand how you can blame the voters when they aren't given accurate information to base their decision on, if we had a more direct democracy, sure, but politics is just a jumbled mess of misinformation and plain lies, and Parliament holding the government to account is also bollocks because party politics means that either the governing party just walks through or the opposition is able to swing a few people.

It doesn't matter if the UK is overcrowded or not, we have to look at the big picture, although I think you'd struggle to support the UK if we didn't import such vast quantities of food.

China has restrictions on births, and as you point out, it is still growing, the problem is births are exponential, if you have 10 people (5 fertile couples) and they have 3 children each, after 1 generation that is 25 people (15 children and 10 adults) another generation and its 47 people (22 new children 25 adults ) then generation 1 dies that leaves 37 people, a population increase of 370%, now rather that 10 people imagine that was 10 million people. In a single generation's lifespan, that growth is unsustainable.

Now whether its our country or not if population increases demand for food production grows, if we aren't using our own land we need to depend on importing but if other countries are also growing they will want to export less to sustain their own country.

If we stop exponential growth, quality of life will improve for everyone globally, because the generation working now won't have to grow and harvest food for a large population that is too young to work, using my example from before the original 10 people have to grow and work for 25 people's worth of food, it will soon get out of hand. Eventually if we lower population growth the food required and number of people required to produce it will balance out so we won't need to keep increasing production because of increased demand."
ukpolitics,fomsbz0,t1_fomr10k,1587902121.0,"This is madness, we can't increase the population just to look after elderly people, according to some research, we are currently at 75% of the capacity of the earth and by 2050 we will be struggling to support the population through lack of resources.

Immigration will happen regardless, and if we ignore that for a moment and focus on global population because that's what my previous point alludes to, an influx of children now will require more children in the future to again look after the elderly. We need to lower the number of people needing support as elderly people, and the only way to do that is to balance the population, so we have enough people to care for them but not too many it will increase the population in the future.

This would require training more people in elderly care rather than just making the population bigger, an incentive to train and an incentive to lower the population growth is the best way forward in my opinion. Otherwise we will have a global crisis where we cannot grow enough food to feed the population."

unitedkingdom,fojfkg8,t3_g7sjux,1587819477.0,"This would be a good incentive if it was a viable thing to do, however from my understanding, the companies that evade tax still pay some corporation tax, and move a significant amount of profits out of the country, but also invest locally, which means you'd then have to investigate which companies are evading, while taking in to consideration how some companies work and where the money is going.

Take Mcdonalds for an example, they are a franchise company, which means the franchisees will be paying to a bigger company legitimately, just because that company is in a tax haven does not mean they haven't paid the tax, Mcdonalds International (made up name) doesn't have to pay tax in a country it does not operate in, because that doesn't make sense, but the individual shops will have to pay tax as they are technically different companies, that have to pay a licence fee to use the brand name and that could be like 90% of profits, some of that money will be reinvested to create more branches and more jobs and more profits in the future.


This is one reason why it is not illegal to evade tax, because depending on company structure it could be a legitimate system. 

The franchised company has paid tax and the umbrella company has paid tax in the correct locations, so you can't do a search for companies that just haven't paid tax because that would be illegal and is relatively kept under wraps, big companies are smart, they pay a lot of people a lot of money to manage these things so they aren't caught out by things like this and making their company bigger better and more profitable. 

A quick disclaimer I am not an expert, all I know is that it's not just a matter of finding the companies."
