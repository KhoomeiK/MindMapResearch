dataisbeautiful,fddew1v,t1_fctzcfv,1578309107.0,Not all countries rely on insurance to afford healthcare. We think that 'I can't afford it' includes insurance related issues with accessing therapy.
dataisbeautiful,fctxlf8,t1_fcturoo,1577964638.0,"Hey, our app isnt live yet. This was a survey circulated through Facebook and our friend circles. Definitely an interest bias on this with it being a voluntary mental health survey, but it certainly wasn't all people who were forthcoming about their mental health and personal struggles."
dataisbeautiful,fctx9ag,t1_fctksox,1577964177.0,"Yes, participants could choose more than one option. Yeah there are so many possible reasons someone might not have been to see a therapist. 

This was specifically for people who had never been to see one and we were trying to make the survey as simple as possible to get a broad idea. 

Honestly, it blew up more than we were expecting and got 3x more responses than we had anticipated."
dataisbeautiful,fctx3bl,t1_fctlk33,1577963945.0,"Yeah we were really impressed with the amount of people that had been in therapy, it was just over 50% (sample is skewed to an interest in mental health)."
dataisbeautiful,fctgxo6,t3_eitxhk,1577942921.0,"Hey!

We undertook some user research last year as part of our app development. We've been going through the data and pulling out various insights as we go, and this is a graph (made in g-sheets) that we thought was quite interesting!

This question was only answered by those who had indicated they had never seen a therapist, and these were the multi choice options that we offered. There was an 'other' answer but there was little in there that indicated a significant trend.

We are conducting user research prior to launching our app at the end of the year. We've been going through the data and pulling out various insights as we go, and this is a graph (made in g-sheets) that we thought was quite interesting! This question was a multiple selection, asking what methods people use to cope with distressing feelings.

We had a previous version of this posted a month or so ago, and there were many great suggestions to swap age with strategy (check our previous posts to see why they were right). So easy to spend a long time looking at data and not notice flaws in layout...

dataisbeautiful,f6ytgc3,t1_f55g5zs,1573296494.0,"Yeah great point. None of us are religious followers, and we had never thought of that! We will be sure to look into it for future research! Thanks."

Follow up surveys are planned to begin soon, we are going to do a final bit of user research as well as some longer term research on how people are using the Bravely app."
dataisbeautiful,f0lk7ng,t1_f0lg8ky,1568721234.0,"No direct income filter but it can be inferred rudimentarily, we have a field for occupation but not income, I haven't dug further into any of that data yet but that is something I will look into. Yeah this question just asked about drug use in a loose sense, so no way to know the type unfortunately, however it is a question I will see if we can explore down the track.

Thanks for your interest!"
dataisbeautiful,f0lk0ph,t1_f0lad3e,1568721036.0,"Thank you! yeah great question, we did not differentiate between prescription and illegal, in hindsight we definitely should of!  But this was our first user research survey, as the app develops we really hope to push for further research to answer questions like these. We want to collaborate with researchers in the mental health space to support further research and promote good science communication/implementation,"

This question was a multiple selection, asking what methods do people use to cope with distressing feelings.

Our favourite trend is the increase in exercise as a coping mechanism for people up until their mid-40s, with a slight dip in the early 30s (perhaps due to the onset of parental demands?). Any trends in here that you can spot and life patterns you would associate it with?
