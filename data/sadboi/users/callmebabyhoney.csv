I actually bought a threadmill, plugged it in once hoping to run for a bit and caused a power outage in my building and also almost set my apartment on fire.

Since then I’ve been medicated, hospitalized and got better. I still stand by the point that my mother is a narcissist and she manipulates me emotionally but I still love her and she is my mother who is sick. Society and family members made sure I always felt guilty trying to distance myself from my mother. 
However, since going to therapy I’ve learned to stop taking everything personally and to be more forgiving or ignore certain things.
Sure, my mother sometimes tells me very hurtful stuff or calls me names or threatens to kick me out or cut me off or thing like that (she hasn’t since I said I could move out.) but she is still my mother. Who doesn’t really hug me or tell me she loves me or other stuff parents do but still.
My therapist told me I can still love my mother even if I cut her off from my life. But I realized I don’t want to. I don’t know how long she will live, 1 year or 10 and I don’t want to wish I was more forgiving while she was alive. 
My posts were dramatic as you said, but I’ve matured and changed. As to what might be doubtful or sounds untrue I don’t know.

I don’t understand why your MIL is there if she isn’t helping your wife with the baby. And if she is helping how does she have the time to observe you and nag you about stuff while you work? 
Also, to me it seems like you do enough if what you say it’s true. 

And the fact that you asked your wife for help and she replied with “too bad” makes me question what type of person she is. I understand being a new mother is hard and she needs some support because you are an essential worker and can’t be with her 24/7. 

My advice is to remind her your work is important for you as well as your family and her mother is preventing you from doing it right. 

I’m assuming she doesn’t currently work so you should remind her that a big part of the income of the household comes from your work. If she still refuses to talk to your MIL then tell her you are not going to stop going to the parking lot.

In my opinion you’re NTA and I don’t understand your wife at all. She’s married to you, shares a house and a bed and a child with you, not with her mother. At some point her mother is going to leave but you won’t and since she married you and had a kid with you, and not her mother, why is she ganging up on you?"

You bought a woman in your daughter’s home locked up her dog( animal abuse) and gave her insomnia and anxiety because of that, accused her of lying because you trust your girlfriend and not your daughter (what the freak) and then you gave her dog away for good which made her psychological issues worse. 

I wish to say a few words, that’s how mad I am but I need to be respectful even if you don’t deserve it.

Also, you got your daughter a dog at 6 YEARS OLD, and then complained she wasn’t taking care of it... She was a 6 years old. They barely learned to take care of themselves.

Firstly, your girlfriend has a daughter. Unless you are reasy to have a daughter I suggest you cut things off now. 

Secondly, you sounded like a child. Your girlfriend and her mother were spending time togheter instead of catering to your needs so you decided to cook food just for yourself instead of making something everyone could have. 

Thirdly, you are living at their place from what I understood. They don’t have to applaud you for doing your duty, aka taking care of your girlfriend’s kid or doing chores. You knew your girlfriend had a kid before getting serious and you accepted that. That means you accepted the responsibility that comes with it.

As someone who struggled with an eating disorder you using emotional manipulation and using your baby as well is going go do nothing but make her distance herself from you. I don’t think you want a pregnant, underweight wife who doesn’t talk to you or doesn’t confess anything.

Also, I don’t really understand. Did she want a baby or not, cause you didn’t mention how she reacted to the pregnancy news or the idea of getting pregnant. There are plenty of women who do not wish to get pregnant or become mothers so I am not sure if it’s an eating disorder or another issue."

I highly recommend starting to seriously lose weight. I don’t know your height but you should lose at least 10 kg to get out of the 100. 

Exercise:
Untill you get your heart checked up I don’t recommend high intensity exercises that would tire it out. I would suggest walking but i know it’s kinda impossible now.

Diet:
Remove fatty foods, processed sugar, too much salt, fried food etc from your meals. Use grilled lean meat, replace fries with baked vegetables and always have a small side salad. Cut out on the bread, pasta or other refined carbs.

Other:
Quit smoking and alcohol for good. You can reserve alcohol for certain ocassions like celebrations or stuff. Try to work on your mental health as well. Stay away from stress.

These are all stuff my doctor told me when I had my first heart attack at 18. For me it was a combo of starving myself, drinking too muck energy drinks and coffee and being stressed out from exams.

What the numbers say currently is that we have over a million infected people but just over 700.000 active cases, which means around two hundred thousand cases had an outcome and a big chunk of people got healthy and survived. Stay clean, wash your hands, avoid going outside unless it’s mandatory (pharmacy, doctor, grocery store etc) and focus on the work or school tasks you have. Panicking or listening to people panick won’t help you. All the love!"

Advice,flmu8j5,t3_fpseho,1585296870.0,"You’re still so young, you have plenty of time to decide.
Planning out your life seems such a huge thing to do at such a young age, and I also felt very intimidated. 

Try to pursue things that interest you, like your art, step out of your confort zone, try new things, volunteer and try to work or do internships, take part in conferences in subjects that interest you.

For me it was always science. At 14, I was 100% I would become a science teacher, but then in highschool I started an internship at a pet shop and I got to watch some minor interventions. I loved it. So I decided on becoming a vet.
First year of vet school I was the most miserable ever because I hated it. It wasn’t what I wanted.
I realized that I prefered to work with people but I felt too stupid for medschool so I chose nursing school because people told me it was easier( it’s not. Just as much info, pressure, long hours etc) so here I was 21 years old trying to get into med school after a year of veterinary and a year of nursing school. 

I failed and tried again at 22 and now I’m in my second year of medschool and I still don’t know what to do with my life. Idk if I want to go abroad, or to another city, do I want to teach, be a surgeon, or maybe pediatrics? 

Another fact, I have classmates that are over 30-40 years old, my favorite is this flight attendant that after witnessing a passenger have a heart attack decided she wants to be a doctor. She’s 35 now. 

My point is, nobody has their life planned out and even if you feel like you decided, you are still changing, everybody is. What you are hell bent on today you might not even care about in 5 years. 

Enjoy your age, you’ll never be this young again, and try out stuff but don’t stress. Success isn’t measured in money but in happiness.
If you want to do art do art, if not, try out stuff and see what you enjoy.

You have your whole life ahead and a world full of possibilities. 
Good luck!"

Things like “I love our stories but I an very tired so we can only do 30 minutes today” or” I love spending time with you but I would like to spend some time with your mother as well” etc is close to how you should deal. I used to be Katie and cling to anybody who showed any kind of interest in me. For me it was a lady librarian. It was the only moment if the day I ever felt normal and like I belong and I felt somewhat close to happiness. I understand what you say but avoiding her would hurt her a lot more than setting some healthy boundaries.

It’s normal to need privacy and sometimes need to be left alone when dealing with stuff that makes you feel vulnerable.
First, I wanted to go for the nah but actually your husband’s reaction upset me.
When I was 11 and all the way till 16-17 sex, boobs,  butts etc were what everyone was talking about. So I don’t think the stepson’s gaze is just “childish curiosity” knowing the boys in my school. And that was when pornography wasn’t just a click away.
