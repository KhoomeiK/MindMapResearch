SuicideWatch,esis5xz,t1_esirsbu,1562019208.0,"Actually met this girl who I clicked really well with, she actually knew I had depression and comforted me perfectly. She was amazing but my toxicity got into play and we turned into a long distance thing, i stopped talking to her for 8 weeks and she never tried, just saw she got a boyfriend so i blocked her on everything which fucked me up as well"
depression,esirn48,t1_esiqwrs,1562018934.0,"There’s a new drug trial going around that I recommend you do research on called esketamine but its rather pricey, practically the same as ketamine but done legally. To get LSD or ketamine illegally, black market would be your friend but you need to do a looooooooot of research because jail time is a real thing"
