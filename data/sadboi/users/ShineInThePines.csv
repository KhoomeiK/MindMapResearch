I finally cracked and asked my mom to help find me a short-term care facility. Instead, she set up some psychiatrist appointments and helped me coordinate care with my therapist. Been on Effexor and haven‚Äôt felt that way since.

Recovery is possible. Don‚Äôt give up. Ask for help. Small tasks, like cooking and cleaning, can feel monumental. But if you have someone that can lend a hand, it will go a long way."

Irritability is a sign of depression, so if he‚Äôs not usually as quick to snap back it could be due to the depression. So is social isolation.

One of the best things that helped me get out of an episode is my mom came to visit in my new apartment. I hadn‚Äôt unpacked after living there for two months. I‚Äôd been telling her things were great (and I genuinely thought they were fine), but when she saw my place she insisted that we unpack and decorate. This was over a weekend we were supposed to be relaxing together. She recognized the signs before I did. I felt a lot better once it was done and it help me hold space to focus on getting better."
