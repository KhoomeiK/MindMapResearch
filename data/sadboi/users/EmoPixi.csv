AskReddit,evrkoii,t3_ckxje3,1564710890.0,"I have been teaching for 6 years now. I love my job. I love the kids and I love the atmosphere. But, what I hate the most is the parents of children with clear learning or psychological disorders that says their children are perfectly fine. A year ago I had a little 5 year old. He couldn't speak, he would hit other children for no reason,he would shit on the floor, he had clear gross motor and fine motor delays. I suspected that he might have autism. Now as a teacher you're not allowed to ""diagnose"" a child. So my co teacher and I decided to tell the mom that we think that he needs testing. She started screaming at us and telling us that there is absolutely nothing wrong with him and he is just shy, that's why he doesn't speak and that he is just being a boy. We later got our grade head involved and she pulled some strings and got her an appointment with an occupational therapist. FOR FREE. She never ended up taking her son. That child was like my baby. I started noticing his triggers and figuring out ways to calm him. I also started my own subtle therapy with this child. I was removed from the classroom about 4 months in because I was required to be in another class, so I don't know what happened to him. Sometimes I still wonder what happened to him and if he is okay.

TL;Dr crazy mom refuses to get possibly autistic non-verbal 5 year old any help."

relationship_advice,evful4h,t3_cjmtco,1564501526.0,"Okay... So your nephew is doing this all to either get attention from your brother, his wife and your mom or he has a learning disability or psychological problem. Possibly learning disabilities can be ADHD. It often makes children violent. He could be looking for a reaction from your family because he otherwise doesn't get any love or attention. I also assume that he is the only child which makes this worse. I would calmly sit down and talk to them and explain that you don't want him close to your baby because he hurt the baby. And tell them that they need to get his eyes and ears tested as well as get him to a EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST or an OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST. They are more capable of testing for these things. Trust me... I'm a teacher"
