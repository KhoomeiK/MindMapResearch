I think it's better doing it by time because you end up remembering why you might have saved it if there's a lot 

Although,. It does seem like you want to decide videos v screenshots. I think screenshots is easier for some reason to begin with. I find there is always loads I didn't need anymore , whereas videos (I assume you've taken) will take longer cos you have to watch them ?"
declutter,fqwlpws,t1_fqw9beh,1589709103.0,"I only had them in 2 places, so it wasn't disorganised, just the quantity was too much. I guess my motivation was this is the most free I will ever be to do it. When I start something, I have to finish it.  I was motivated to do it because I no longer want to see photos of some people anymore. It was something I knew would be difficult but I knew I had to do it eventually, so if not now, I probably wouldn't ever finish it. 


I would start if you can to put everything in one location e.g. on your computer. My photos were on both my computer and external hard drive, so I put them all just on the computer. 

I made my folders by year and then the month then the event. I don't use software and I didn't have duplicates. 

 When you have a lot to go through There isn't a way I could sort that much out quickly so I just thought If I keep going eventually it will be finished. I did more everyday than I thought I would. However I wouldn't pay attention to the number you've done each time because it could be overwhelming how much is left to do

 I  deleted photos I didn't like the look of, or I had multiple similar shots /angles of, or just didn't want to remember that time. After I finished each day, I backed up my progress to my hard drive. 

Additionally I had some videos I took too that I didn't even realise I had. I didn't keep any of those so that helped."

I more so have depression and anxiety is less so but yeah. 
So before I saw therapist  recently  & even some other days 

I find it hard to get out of bed. In bed, is where it's safe and no one will disturb me. I'm not trying to be lazy, rather that everything else even going to the bathroom feels impossible. 

I find it hard to keep up hygiene daily. 
I find it hard to sleep normally 

I find it hard to remember to eat 3 meals 

When it's very bad, even if something small happened that was upsetting or annoying - my head immediately says to me ""wish I was d word"" and it just basically never goes away. It seems to always be telling me that. How can you do everything everyday if even tiny problems make you think you're better off d word? It is horrible to deal with. 


When I'm depressed , I don't just cry or it's not the same as being ""sad"".. I feel like everything is weighing on me, I don't want to see anyone, I don't want to talk. All I can do is maybe eat a little and sleep. I just feel like I'm worthless, I'm better off d word, no one likes me  (even when my partner says it's not true and they obviously like me). Just so many negative things that stay in my mind for days, hours however long until I somehow pull my self out of it. 

Nowadays when I try to wake up early in the morning which I'm not used to, my first thought is usually the whole being d word thing is better than this. It's ridiculous , it doesn't make sense but it happens to me."

You could even write down stuff if you find it hard to say to them, and then it could be easier to discuss after

depression,fi1akoc,t3_f5w1q6,1582053922.0,"Hi I'm sorry I'm currently super tired so I'm hopefully responding to what you've said correctly 

When I first saw mine I didn't know what I would say 

Then they asked some questions and it all came out of me easier than I thought it would. I think I have been waiting my whole life for therapy and I didn't realise how helpful it would be (as if I didnt realise how helpful and supportive they can be to talk to)

Don't be too worried about not knowing what to say. Sometimes I would turn up and be doing extremely bad, and they would ask me questions like how things have progressed or changed about something going  on in my life. They are there to help if they're good therapists. They will help you work out the mess in your mind. I am in no way fixed or whatever, don't think I ever wil be completely but they are there to help you work things out 

Don't stress or worry about it, try your best not to. Also, you're not whining. I  know there are others in the world who have it worse than me for various reasons. But that doesn't stop me from feeling awful many days. Even people who have everything they possibly could want - family, relationship, money whatever .

So when I went home for the holidays , I tried to act like I used to.


So like hanging out in the room with them, eating dinner together, taking about random things, watch stuff together . Sometimes I went to the local library to study instead of staying at the house. 


It was hard but then I remembered I did this for my entire life. I could pretend and act cos I knew exactly what I used to be like around them. Sometimes they are predictable, so if I could feel for even a moment they were starting to bother me, I would say I needed to finish an assignment or something (lol) and I would leave the room. Also, I knew it was going to be over soon so it was not that much longer to pretend. It drained me so much but I knew I could keep it up a little longer 


For phone calls though, I literally only stayed on the phone as long as they wanted to speak. But most of the time I acted like I was too busy studying (lol) or doing something important (lol) to call, and so they could message me if it was important. 

I think they could probably tell based on the phone calls I was acting different but they were miles away, and I didn't care."

Then I did during graduation slightly , but it was like the first time I felt proud of myself massively instead of negative. And I didn't want to bring myself down on a celebratory day. 

When I went NC  I also felt finally like I had control of my own life. They can't do anything about me anymore. They can't find me. They cant message me , or call me. Its the best feeling , like no you aren't invited to my graduation, no you can't do anything about it. 

But I do feel guilt about my sibling. I go back and forth if I hate them or not. They did a lot of horrible things as I think they could be narcissists too. We don't talk anymore. 

I think the guilt gradually goes away, I certainly didn't regret it with my nparent, I probably won't either about my sibling although it makes me feel sad in a different way.

For instance, I asked my parent to decide about 2 separate kinds of items - let's say, a bunch of boxes and free food trays we got. 

I started off asking gently, a few days ago, if they could take the time to sort it out. Today, I asked them to again, and they kept sort of avoiding it or talking about other things.

 Eventually, I was more firm about the fact they promised to decide tonight and they finally did. I will say it made me very frustrated that it took almost a few hours before they took action.

I definitely do think they will only budge if they want to change it themselves. I have lived before in a very cluttered environment and I am determined not to let that happen again. My parent still has boxes and bags of possessions they need to sort out, but I don't ask them to do those, because I'm not trying to push them to do it.

I also sometimes tell them how I would think about it- like that it is taking up space so we can't reach stuff, or that we trip over things, or that we won't be able to use the things we want to because this is in the way.

There's nothing wrong with leisure. I think being happy is most important if I could achieve that. I was surrounded by friends who were the smartest kids, and I felt inferior.

depression,famv2lh,t3_e9unni,1576213717.0,"Hiiiiii. So I also have issues with my teeth - I believe it must be as I didn't make sure I brushed my teeth for years. Only every few days. It terrifies me to Google anything about my teeth problems. I also had a period of time where I managed to finally shower everyday for like a few months and now I stopped doing that again... Sigh 

I think I just had a massive fear of messing my teeth up any further after years of not looking after them . I did exactly what they told me to every single day, went back for an appointment recently and they said I still had issues. I literally cried in the appointment lol. I felt embarrassed later, but oh well.  You could try , like me to try and just do your teeth at least everyday. Then eventually try to add the other hygiene parts later. We can only keep trying our best, you know? It does hurt knowing depression messed up my body in numerous ways. Hoping the best for you. It's ok."
raisedbynarcissists,famumg6,t3_e9us2h,1576213334.0,"Well I have been in a relationship for a few years but not anywhere near close to marriage or children yet. 

My nparent was extremely against it from the beginning and terrified me into trying to not carry on with it. I took the time to do what I wanted, which was to stay with my partner despite nparent attempting to persuade me out of it. Nparent became quite obviously awkward with Me, I felt afraid to go back home (visiting ) and stuff. Same with calling and texting, they were so angry for a long while.

 Eventually they acted normal with me again, then they basically acted like my partner didn't exist. I was afraid to bring them up in conversation. 

Then later on, they met my partner and acted fake nice and was weird as always in their own strange way. I regret that moment, they never deserved to meet my partner.

Since then I don't speak to my nparent anymore best decision I made."
raisedbynarcissists,famu2lc,t3_e9uscq,1576212878.0,"I messaged my n parent I was leaving, and I don't want to say anything more (they kept ranting at me). I haven't said anything since


 I didn't want to say anything more and I felt like it was enough? It was already a shock to them I said it. I messaged it because I was afraid of calling about it and stuff. It was the quickest way I knew they'd find out. I was putting it off for a long time out of fear. 

 I guess it wasn't exactly clear I wasnt planning to speak to them ever again, but they got the message eventually. I think I was too scared to actually state that I didn't want to have contact ever again though."
depression,famttex,t3_e9v975,1576212675.0,It hurts doesnt it. I hate that is a reality. We somehow have to hold ourselves up. At the end of the day. How do we carry on? I barely understand how.
depression,famti8p,t3_e9vfcq,1576212430.0,"Very similar with some parts not. I haven't slept properly for years. I haven't eaten properly for years. I sleep too much, too little, and the same with eating. It's really messed up. It really is a huge problem for me and probably a big root in my depression and depressive habits if that's a thing. Its so hard to break out of.  I have done it a few times and went right back to this. I'm supposed to be asleep right now."
depression,famt843,t3_e9vs0a,1576212211.0,"Well I agree that people don't understand or only care when they want to come across as caring. I have certainly also had my moment of being annoyed / mad about it too. But I don't want to wish this feeling on anybody. Its like a never ending suffering. I think people just don't get it because they haven't been through it so they find it really hard. I'm sorry. I hate it, but I know deep inside only I can change things, no matter who speaks to me about it and tries their best to help me"
depression,famt22g,t3_e9vtei,1576212084.0,Yeah I think that too it hurts so much I will never eescape I guess.
depression,famsz7k,t3_e9vuag,1576212022.0,"I like listening too music , or talking to my favourite person - my partner. Sometimes watching a movie I like, or TV I like. At the same time, sometimes nothing works. You have to just wait it out. I'm sorry. I hope you feel a little better soon."
depression,famswab,t3_e9vvkm,1576211959.0,Don't have any close friends haven't for many years.
depression,famssd8,t3_e9vyby,1576211874.0,Hi I used to follow people I believed to be prettier than me on social media and it was better when I unfolllwlwed them. I don't totally like how I look right now but I was always comparing myself to everybody. It would be nice to have a bit less weight but I think it would make me even sadder somehow (as in how to achieve it lol) . You are awesome the way you are. Trust me :)
raisedbynarcissists,famslzd,t3_e9w5hq,1576211734.0,"No, I am still a child inside somehow. I feel that . I wish I knew how to be. :("
raisedbynarcissists,famsjco,t3_e9w7aa,1576211677.0,"Well no, but my nparent used to actually have conversations , ask how people are, and generally act like a nice person. At home , they were horrible, shouting, rude and when not , they barely acknowledged I was there. Not exactly the same but yeah"
depression,famsgcg,t3_e9wb2j,1576211613.0,Same. But we can't let it happen. We need to hold on somehow
depression,famsejv,t3_e9whzt,1576211575.0,"I'm doing really bad with eating properly as well as sleep, which I should be doing right now.  Eating 3 meals is not something I've done properly for years. :("
depression,famsc5z,t3_e9widl,1576211524.0,I hope the best for all of us :( I don't think I've been alive properly for a long time
depression,fams7up,t3_e9wklq,1576211433.0,"Lol absolutely I barely let anyone know cos I don't have close friends anymore and I don't want them to dislike me for being sad. I try not to say much about it :( it really feels like endless suffering and you really don't get it unless you're going through it, but I don't want anyone to go through it either. It's hard.   people that try to understand and listen are the best people to have around"
depression,famry5b,t3_e9x6vw,1576211231.0,Yeah I barely feel like I am living most of the time lol
depression,famrw1a,t3_e9x8ct,1576211188.0,"Hi, ok so this girl - she really will not matter in the future. Even if she is around somehow in your future, it doesn't matter - because looking at how others do isn't good for people like us. I don't use Facebook anymore and things like that for that reason. I compare myself , and feel like c**p. It only matters is your life. And I'm sorry you didn't get into the college you wanted. I really am. But trust me, far into the future you will see there is nothing wrong with going to a different college or taking a route that might not have made your parents as proud - because it matters more how you feel. Of course it's nice a feeling to make them proud. Although, I personally took a degree that I realise now I don't think I even liked because I thought I was ""meant to "" under my parent influence. I hope the best for your future OP. You matter in your life. :)"
depression,famrg2u,t3_e9xdfz,1576210862.0,I also feel like everything turns for the bad :(
depression,famr9ni,t3_e9xm3b,1576210732.0,"Listen to me. I struggled very hard at college too. You can only do as much as you can. From what you said, it seems like you have tried as hard as you can. Please don't be too hard on yourself. We aren't like everyone else, and things are different for others - I from the outside might have seemed like I had things together, but I was wanting to die inside everyday at college. It is ok if it takes you longer to finish your studies, or if you take a long break, or decided to not return for example. Theres only so much you can do , you are a human and if you find things hard, then it's ok to find things hard."
depression,famqxs7,t3_e9xr5h,1576210490.0,"It's not the same at all, but someone was extremely rude to me  recently. I don't know them , but they made comments about myself, I guess not that bad but it made me want to die - it's been at least a week and the thoughts have  not stopped.

 I'm not sure how, but I know we can't let it consume us like this. We are more than these people make us appear to be. 

I grew up around a parent that was never positive but  mostly critical, and as a result I think it made me really overly sensitive when people are like that to me. I am unsure how to not take things so hard, but I know we aren't failures or their comments they say. 

They say these words without thinking how it might hurt or whatever, but it stayed with me for days right? I don't know how to let it go, I hear the words in my mind. 

There is no measure to how we are meant to have done good or whatever in our lives.  I know you're not a failure. No matter what. We can only do as much as we can. I don't know if this made sense, sorry."
depression,famqhqd,t3_e9xzqj,1576210161.0,"I thought for a long time I'm just so lazy and suddenly it makes all the sense in the world I'm depressed. I personally wasn't sure until my counsellor told me they thought I might be depressed and I thougt it over myself, and accepted that is how I probably am. I went from being lazy possibly and not understanding my behaviour, to it getting worse and worse, suddenly feeling like wanting to not be alive. Then I realised maybe all those years of feeling ""lazy"" were depressive sides of me that weren't so strong yet like it is now. Don't let it get to this stage if possible please., It feels impossible to get out of it. Maybe some people would say you can get diagnosed? I'm not sure. But I felt like I didn't want to believe it at first when I researched online , and only did after my counsellor told me."
depression,famq75g,t3_e9y9q2,1576209953.0,"I feel the same people say it will go away it will get better I think it'll always haunt me, it always comes back and I'm somehow feeling like this is normal for me now. Hopefully some day it will be less frequent for us :("
depression,famq184,t3_e9yhoe,1576209837.0,"I also have times where I feel like I'm doing good I'm doing productive things and it feels scary because I'm so used to being sad. This new feeling is scary, and I haven't much to offer in advice. Maybe someday we can hold onto our hope instead of letting it fall away so quickly"
depression,fampvvv,t3_e9yjov,1576209735.0,"I hope you keep holding onto what you are aiming towards with studies or what makes you happy.. it affects us all, no matter our circumstances even if it differs. I'm sad right now too, but it almost doesn't matter why. Let's hope we all will be better with time."
depression,fampmaw,t3_e9yqw5,1576209550.0,This is a nice and kind post I don't see often thank you
depression,fampk1q,t3_e9yrce,1576209507.0,I can relate. I don't have any friends anymore since school. :(
raisedbynarcissists,f6z7n1e,t3_dtsaqk,1573311409.0,It's hard to accept when you keep wanting them to be a good person even though you know they arent.
raisedbynarcissists,f6z7hhh,t1_f6yl7ek,1573311284.0,"Thank you this was written how I feel. I realised my sibling is narcissistic and nearly as much as my nparent. It was eye opening to realise they were bad people for me, but also saddening."
raisedbynarcissists,f6y8pkg,t3_dtalgt,1573271124.0,I only do in my dreams. I push the feelings away and I make myself remember how they hurt me. I will never let myself have them back in my life. I have to remind myself that they were rarely good.
depression,f5kovw8,t1_f5ko5a7,1572267592.0,Just empty inside. Very empty.
depression,f5kl4g8,t1_f5kkhc6,1572265685.0,I kind of know what activities help me but then I have days where I don't even want to do the fun stuff. Like today. I like doing art but I don't feel like it. It makes me so sad seeing everyone on here in pain. I wish there was a way for us all to be happy again...  I forgot what that  is like
depression,f5kjs2p,t3_do3s3e,1572264882.0,I am having that day today.
depression,f5khzdd,t3_dnvq2h,1572263770.0,I had a dream that I had a nice supportive kind family again and it basically was how I used to pretend to myself my life was when it never was like that. It was sad. I kept trying to get back to sleep. Then I properly woke up and remembered that I don't speak to half my family anymore bc they're not good people
depression,f5khsgs,t3_do2inj,1572263647.0,I felt really negative and like I couldn't do a lot of basic things easily.i took like an online test and it said i might have depression and anxiety. I went to a counsellor at uni and they told me they think I have that.
depression,f5kh0gx,t3_do2l1p,1572263140.0,I am afraid this will happen to me as we are also long distance and I am pain to talk to. I can only say I hope you will find the strength inside yourself. I don't know much more. I'm really sorry.
depression,f5kgvik,t3_do5uf1,1572263056.0,I'm kinda pissed off I already slept like 12 hours I wish I could sleep even more. Being awake is being in pain. I understand you completely. It lets us escape from feeling like this.
depression,f5kgswo,t3_do6ywm,1572263013.0,I cried and told them what I felt was wrong and they gave me a piece of paper saying you self refer for counselling cos I didn't want to take any medication. I have been in counselling before and mentioned that . They listened and didn't say much else.. asked a few questions. Kind of wish they said more than just self refer. I don't even know what I would've wanted them to say. Sorry if it not helpful
depression,f5kgjns,t3_dnwq19,1572262856.0,I also hate waking up. I hate every second of everyday. Nothing helps anymore.
