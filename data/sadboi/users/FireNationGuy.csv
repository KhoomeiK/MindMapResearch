WhiteWolfRPG,f2iz436,t1_f2h0f37,1570264833.0,"To be fair, it was a time of world wide consensus shift. They faced paradox as the force we know today for the first time.

Think about it in a hermetic perspective; you have formulae that has worked for centuries that suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. Even the simplest spells are getting harder to do each passing day. And you have no idea why.

I don't blame them for thinking that magic was dying, and their instinct to preserve magic was noble. But what kind of an idiot thinks that the next logical step is becoming a lifeless blood sucking monster is beyond me."
DaystromInstitute,f23c89c,t1_f1ypszz,1569916217.0,"In all languages, including sign language, the average time for language acquisition in babies are fairly consistent. This includes certain phases of language acquisition, like pointing at something and making sounds to form a proto-sentence of sorts (However I do not know if that is the case for blind babies). 

I think universal translator would disrupt this process if it works by analysing the brain waves, hindering the baby's need to form a sophisticated syntax, and maybe even eliminating the need for coherent words. 

They would have to turn off the translator so that the baby could learn.

Babies can understand the difference between languages, and learn all of them perfectly if they are given enough raw data to process. This mechanism (if I'm remembering correctly) works only if they are given enough reason to think that they are different languages; mostly in the form of different people talking in different languages. But there are circumstances that can hinder language acquisition, like one of the parents switching arbitrarily between languages, making the baby think that multiple languages are in fact a single one. 

So, in my opinion, living in a space station or starship wouldn't be a problem, as long as people around the baby talks consistently in one language, and telepathy doesn't intervene."

Disciplines would be presence, auspex, and a clan discipline that is a cross between necromancy and dementation.

Curse: The more they dabble in the supernatural, the more the clan members slowly stray away from this reality. For every five points of blood they use in a single night, they get a cumulative penalty to perception, socials, or willpower."

WhiteWolfRPG,et6rzz9,t3_ca6ako,1562518302.0,"In ascension, reality relies on the will of the masses. It is mostly affected by what people believe in. For example a local legend may allow a cryptid to exist in a village, but as soon as you carry it somewhere else it transports to umbra or simply dissolves because of paradox. Or people of a culture can do rituals that border on sorcery, but they only actually work in places that the particular culture is dominant. 

This much is expected. What is hinted through many editions and books are, however, that it doesn't just end in beliefs. People's subconscious also effect reality. I can think of very few examples. Nerve gas, although completely mundane, is so malicious that werewolves can sense it with ""sense wyrm"". Ancient Greeks armies were so unified with experience, sense of kinship, and homoeroticism, an army of soldiers counted as a single entity for some spells. (Those two examples are from books.)

So, even though nuclear physics is a part of the consensus, atomic bombs are such atrocities that the consensus subconsciously rejects them. As a general rule, if something isn't part of the consensus, it requires magic to operate. So they aren't sacrificing the technocrat as in human sacrifice. The technocrat is casting a spell to make the bomb work, and facing the high amount of paradox, which risks his/her life."
WhiteWolfRPG,esps9ab,t1_esplpq1,1562189190.0,"This is how my group still uses it. Appearance is not a measure of how hot you are, it is a measure of how well you make first impressions.

&#x200B;

If I remember correctly, there was a skill called 'style' that literally added its ranks to your appearance and did nothing more.

Also, as a ST, if I deemed a NPC shallow enough, I'd make players roll with appearance instead of charisma. But I am aware that it is a highly questionable choice."
