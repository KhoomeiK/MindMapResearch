Io questo post l'ho fatto contro chi spaccia l'italiano per semplice.
Ovvio se mi chiedi ""ma le lingue sono complesse?"" OVVIO.
Inoltre non ho paragonato l'italiano al cinese bens√¨ al francese ed allo spagnolo, non passare dalla padella all brace perch√© qui si parla di lingue romanze.
Non posso sinceramente reputare n√© il rumeno n√© il francese romanze, hanno influenze forestiere.
""Il cinese √® difficile"" non √® vero, lo √® per me che parlo latino ma per un giapponese √® pi√π semplice.

In pratica mi tacci di sparare cazzate quando non capisci il mio ragionamento e non chiedi su che basi si pone.
Beh, si basa sulle lingue latine e non credo si possa confrontare una non latina con una latina.
L'inglese deriva dal proto bretone, quindi francese ed inglese hanno la stessa matrice e quindi posso fare un paragone.
Posso paragonare il latino all'italiano ma non potrei col francese o col rumeno, difficilmente con lo spagnolo.

In pratica tu mi parli di cinese quando io parlo di lingue romanze, se parliamo di francese di riflesso aggiungo l'inglese."

You should know where put a verb like 'credeste' and not using alternative like everybody.
Spanish and french don't have such complexity because they involve only a few.
Advanced italian grammar is much more complex than german's one that is difficult in the start only.
Italian is the only latin's language without rules and so basically i can write everything...is cool but italian's are obsessed with grammar.
We dont say 'they/it' but in our phrases are important and not always is what you're thinking so not always gramarly there's rule.
