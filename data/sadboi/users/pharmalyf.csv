newzealand,fm3pd58,t3_fsfh85,1585731964.0,My husband is currently just getting the Covid-19 wage subsidy and no employer top up. (Employers can’t afford it as not trading) -are we likely to be eligible for more WFF over this time and should I apply? (Also how do I do that? We’ve never been eligible before) or will it all wash out at the EOFY (which doesn’t really help as the wage subsidy has only just started)

You don’t go unless you have something you need, you know exactly what it is and you can get in and out and keep 2 metres from people.

I’m a contractor so he wouldn’t have had to pay me sick pay, and HE WAS THERE, so he could have worked and not had to shut the pharmacy (I’m a pharmacist so if you can’t get cover the pharmacy has to close). He just told me to take a triple dose of zinc, never mind that zinc makes me incredibly nauseous. Health professionals can be absolute jerks, I think he was trying to drum up business hoping I would infect all the patients so they would buy some more of his bullshit echinacea potion. Yeah, I’m not bitter."

I had an amazing one once, only short term though.
He was away more than he was there, his company paid his rent and he was a highly paid executive at the company. He left the place impeccable and exactly as he found it. Very friendly and polite. Total Unicorn, I don’t imagine I’ll see one again."

Which is ironic as one of the reasons I’m here is exacerbation of PTSD from a robbery I was a victim of due to finding out the robber has been released from jail. I actually went to a restorative justice meeting with him in jail and I can confirm it was far nicer than this psych hospital"

I’m really struggling but I have to say, money and a career won’t make you happy, though they might take the edge off. Finding a partner won’t. Having a baby (if that’s what you want) won’t. I’m always thinking ‘I just need to get through this and then I’ll be happy’. But it never fucking works. I have a good career, a fabulous husband, our dream house, two rentals, an overly loyal cat and a baby that we tried for for three years. I always kept thinking I’d be better out the other side-once I had a partner, once I finished study, once I had a job, once we had a house, once we had our dream house, once we had a baby, once we had a fancy car and boat, once we’d been to Fiji....you know what? The depression is still there and still gets me. You have to find ways to be happy and then seek out the stuff. Unfortunately I have no fucking idea how to do that-meds help sometimes but I seem to always get back to the same spot. At least I’ve been here enough times I can convince myself now that it will get better, and it will for you too, even if it seems fucking impossible right now."
