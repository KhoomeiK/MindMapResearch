Anxietyhelp,fj61ipx,t3_fbgp3n,1583052116.0,"yes I get this with most social interactions (getting the bus, shopping, ordering food etc) and I think it’s because I get anxious about my voice/stuttering? I can’t really place where its come from, but I think also because I’ve been anxious in that situation before then it comes back every time- its a bit of a cycle ygm"
Anxiety,fj60pqh,t3_fbq6n2,1583051042.0,I do this so much especially at the moment. I like being on my own as I’m v introverted and quite independent but I’ve got into the habit of declining invites to things just because I can’t face social interaction. As a result of this I’ve started feeling really isolated like everyone is forgetting about me. I’ve started feeling like all my friends dislike me and find me boring and miserable so this makes me wanna be on my own more
Anxiety,fcz0oxs,t1_fcz0ee6,1578091304.0,"yea that’s what happened to me, I was with some friends and just started screaming so they called an ambulance coz I wouldn’t stop. It just feels like the world is falling in it’s acc so scary all u can do is scream"
