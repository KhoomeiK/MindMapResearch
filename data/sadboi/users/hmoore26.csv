nonononoyes,ff8zadw,t3_es9s7m,1579700764.0,This is really hard to watch.... poor little ducky:(
depression,fe4r99t,t1_fe0xhf2,1578862034.0,Thanks I appreciate it. Iâ€™m working through it with a therapist but itâ€™s slow going.
depression,fdxisi6,t1_fdxaudm,1578769123.0,I know and the hard part is that I still believe in God but Iâ€™m so used to being told what to believe and what to do they I have a hard time living my own life. This year Iâ€™m trying to be more me and live the life I want to live. Just hard to get there.
depression,fcz8fk2,t1_fcz69k5,1578095770.0,I get that my first post on here was hard too. But I am glad that I am able to talk about things Iâ€™m struggling with and people understand.
depression,fcz85v6,t1_fcz4lrd,1578095614.0,I definitely understand that kind of pain. I feel like no one makes the effort to talk to me and make sure Iâ€™m ok.
depression,fcz7x4o,t3_ejnao7,1578095473.0,"I definitely feel that way. The only people I can talk to is my family and I always feel so bad after. I always end up apologizing afterwords and I can feel like they donâ€™t like talking to me for that reason. 

In fact they never call me I always call them and that upsets me when I think about it because it makes me feel like they donâ€™t care. I suppose it could be because Iâ€™m such a depressing person to talk to."
depression,fcn9a26,t3_ehzwxw,1577806551.0,Group hug from me:) hope this year is the best ever.
depression,fbxgtld,t3_eez173,1577186733.0,"I am so sorry that you feel this way. I struggle with the same feelings you are dealing with and am very lonely too. 

If you feel like you would like someone to talk or vent to I am always available to talk to. Please hang in there."
depression,fbelven,t3_ecedu0,1576788597.0,Thanks all for the answers and support. I hope I can find what works for me soon and I will let you guys know when I have more ideas.
depression,fbc3ezv,t1_fbc3d2b,1576714703.0,I know that is the worst. I canâ€™t stand that
depression,fbasbmz,t1_fbartg4,1576685688.0,I hope you find someone soon too. You deserve to feel loved and cared for.
depression,fbarn6v,t1_fbarczh,1576685258.0,Exactly I think that is something that really bothers me. I really have a need to feel love and affection from someone and I have never had that. I have never had a boyfriend either and Iâ€™m 27. I really hate it.
depression,fbaqx1b,t1_fbaqlzk,1576684790.0,I guess it varies for different people. I also like to write but I find it hard to motivate myself to do it most of the time. I wish that nighttime was not a thing. I sleep fine during the day. I just hate feeling lonely ðŸ˜ž
anime_irl,fb5z521,t3_ebeutf,1576537417.0,I really hate it when you guys take manga out of context. Lamo
depression,fb52iyr,t3_ebe58m,1576519759.0,I really hate it too!!
depression,fb4o6hv,t3_ebcuhl,1576512556.0,Itâ€™s a lot of things. I grew up with a really abusive dad and it has caused me to have really bad anxiety most of my life. I donâ€™t have a job or any friends so I end feeling alone.
depression,fb3u7sg,t1_fb3u06t,1576489420.0,I canâ€™t tell if you are being sarcastic or not. But either way itâ€™s too much to talk about right now. Itâ€™s a super long story
interestingasfuck,f93jjyl,t3_e3csx0,1575060655.0,I legit sat here way too long waiting for the clip to end lol ðŸ˜‚
depression,f8w0oww,t3_e2gnrw,1574881017.0,I totally agree. Itâ€™s definitely a way to escape for me. I wish that I could really die but Iâ€™m scared to do that to my family so itâ€™s the closest I can get.
me_irl,f7dmaa1,t3_dvlhqf,1573621113.0,Oh no!!!! I really donâ€™t like this!!
nonononoyes,f7bxv6j,t3_dvazpo,1573580052.0,The guy didnâ€™t even look that upset just mildly amused lol
mildlyinfuriating,f77a3mf,t3_dukfk8,1573448436.0,KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
nonononoyes,f3laxl7,t1_f3khu0x,1570974180.0,That would make sense youâ€™re right
nonononoyes,f3j2uel,t3_dh528y,1570946070.0,Why is the fence there lol. Itâ€™s clear they can get through it. Maybe for the people?
somethingimade,f1d475w,t3_d8q3h9,1569373444.0,That is so awesome! Well done:)
mildlyinfuriating,f0xxopj,t3_d768zi,1569052491.0,ðŸ˜¢this makes me so sad. Come on people thatâ€™s disgusting!
movies,ezik44m,t3_d0vf2t,1567928450.0,Gosh I find that hard to watch....
