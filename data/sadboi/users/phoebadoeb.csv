Get rid of her.


She's not your friend. She is manipulating you. She may not be doing it maliciously, but you have repeatedly asked her to stop and she has not done so. You should not be putting up with her crap, and if you feel obligated to her because of your friendship, stop it. You don't owe her anything. The way she is treating you is unacceptable and if she doesn't realise it, she damn well should.


One day I deleted my friend off Facebook and never spoke to her again. Totally ghosted her. While I don't necessarily condone ghosting, it was the best thing for me in order to keep my sanity.


She is not your responsibility, and at 16 years old I'm sure you have many other things that are stressing you out without her making you feel like shit as well. Have courage, and stand up for yourself.
