SuicideWatch,ffa5xld,t3_es07op,1579728520.0,"I feel this. Especially while driving I often fantasize about dying in a tragic accident. However I try to avert these thoughts now, the last time I had one of these thoughts I ended up rear ending someone in traffic. Not my proudest moment but luckily everyone walked away without a scratch."

SuicideWatch,ff9zybv,t1_fcbmsf6,1579725089.0,Wow glad I’m not the only one living in this reality. I often have to supplement with drugs and alcohol just to feel emotions otherwise I feel complete emptiness and at times it’s so overwhelming I have these ridiculous explosive panic attacks. Like how in the fuck do I fix this cause being dependent on weed and other shit is only making it worse when I’m forced to be sober.
SuicideWatch,ff9ytg7,t3_egyeqz,1579724425.0,"What if your problem is not temporary. I think my brain is just wrong. Nothing happened to make me start feeling this way. I often thought about killing my self before I could even grasp the concept of suicide. Sometimes I think I was an accident and my whole existence wasn’t meant to happen. I wasn’t meant to be born or to feel or to have relationships. But now that I’ve gone on for so long I’ve complicated things. I care for others more than I care for myself and that’s been what’s keeping me on this earth. But I know that if I was to burn every bridge in my life (which I have contemplated quite often) I could end my life with no guilt or remorse and just be at peace. I love my family and friends of course. But I know if they did not love me back there would be nothing stopping me from ending my life. I’m struggling here trying to do something to change this cause I do want to live, but I’m finding it difficult to see why. I’ve even thought about having a child so that I could have a pretty solid excuse to stay around a while longer. I do not feel sad and I do not feel alone. I am conflicted because on one hand I don’t care about much but at the same time I do care about hurting others. I don’t care about hurting myself. But I know if I do I will hurt others. I’m not quite sure if this makes sense. Just a train of thought."
