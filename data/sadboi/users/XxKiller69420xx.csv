I *HATED* Cadsuane.  100% i would have tortured her slowly, flaying her skin from her body and cauterizing the flesh.  Then forcing the best aes sedai oathbound to obey me to heal her. Then starting over and over forever. I would have done my best to make Semirhage shrink away in horror. Once her mind was broken completely i would balefire her as hard as i could so her thread was gone from the pattern forever. Then i would do the same thing to every bloody seafolk. And then to every Aes Sedai who wouldn't kneel.  I love this series, but the entitled b1tches i had to read about had me gritting my teeth and wishing Rand would snap and rip them apart."
