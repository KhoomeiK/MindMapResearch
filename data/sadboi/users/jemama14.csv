bipolar,fhgn195,t3_f33y6y,1581571858.0,Therapist told me. I was in therapy and said that I had been in a “low” for a while (a couple months) but figured an “up” was coming and then I always anticipated the up cause I felt more like myself. We then did a questionnaire and I got an almost perfect score. Then a psychiatrist confirmed.

bipolar,fh1y8f8,t1_fh02a1c,1581228000.0,I honestly don’t know. I don’t know if daydreaming is as vivid as these are for me. I can feel the emotions that I *think I would I feel in these moments/scenarios. I can hear other people’s voices in these things.

bipolar,fgu6tux,t1_fgs6jsu,1581114239.0,Writing is a good idea! I do that when I have racing thoughts sometimes. It’s also the only way I can generally work through a flashback.
bipolar,fgu6qhw,t1_fgs2laj,1581114189.0,Yes! That thing about conversations is also me. Constantly. I’ll remember a conversation from forever ago and go over it and over it in my head.

harrypotter,fgpus96,t1_fgpqbya,1581012412.0,"He gets tons of kisses! He got his name because he’s grey, our cats all get Harry Potter names and because I knew he was a mischievous little thing lol He most definitely lives up to his namesakes reputation lol"
bipolar,fgp9rra,t1_fgomjz1,1581000267.0,This is the side of mania that does scare me. I had a rough night the other night with it and almost checked myself in.

bipolar,fgnqxkw,t3_ez9r3b,1580950922.0,I overshare with coworkers. Literally thought about this earlier. Like we will have a small convo and I just keep talking...and talking...and tmi’ing and I can’t stop. Like I absolutely have to tell you this thing right now or I’ll explode.

bipolar,fgjg0o9,t1_fgj40om,1580843264.0,"This episode was probably one of the worst, if not the worst I’ve had. Which is why I’m even considering meds. It freaked me out enough to get me back to that decision crossroads."
bipolar,fgjfvdx,t1_fgj3856,1580843173.0,I want better I’ve just had such a rough experience with them in the past. I also don’t trust them. Like I don’t trust what is in them and what it does to your body over time. But I’m definitely looking into it.
bipolar,fgiwshw,t1_fgiwkeg,1580832602.0,"Thank you for your kind words. I remember being on risperidone and klonopin. The klonopin was crap. I was on a stabilizer, anti depressant and one of the above mentioned anti anxiety meds. And I was a zombie. Lithium scares me."
bipolar,fgiwb22,t1_fgivbfg,1580832302.0,It’s been a few years since I was on anything. I just remember being a zombie. The only thing I liked was Xanax. It was incredible for my anxiety. That’s also when I was having pretty strong panic attacks and was diagnosed agoraphobic.
bipolar,fgiuf05,t1_fgiu9zw,1580831140.0,"I was good for so long. Like leveled out. I was, I think, slowly going down but the other night was just really bad. And then to be way up like I am right now. I just don’t know."
