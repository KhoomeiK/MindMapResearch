Know that this is just their insecurity speaking. Remember they also have BDD too. These people are simply reflecting their self hatred and frustrations on everyone else. Rationally speaking, most of us are just normal people. Some are ugly, most are average, and some are beautiful. There is no different ugly to pretty ratio when it comes to this disorder. The numbers are probably the same when you put an ugly/pretty ratio on every single person in this world. 

Instead of focusing on the what-if I’m ugly thoughts, maybe consider the what-if I’m beautiful? Try to ignore everything you obsess about and list some things that you actually like, even if it’s just occasionally."

That’s what a little boy would be burning a day, not an overweight older woman. Hell, anorexics with very low body mass and slowed metabolisms would be burning more than that. So it restrains us so much. If I could erase this disease I would. Losing weight, water weight or fat, is so hard. And not just because we don’t burn as many calories — our bodies literally hold onto fat for dear life. And gaining weight is SO EASY.

SuicideWatch,fkiwp2f,t3_fince4,1584230426.0,"I’m a f15 about to turn 16 in July, and it’s completely humiliating to talk about anything sexual in nature with your parents. I totally get that. But they invaded YOUR privacy and it’s really brash and horrible of them to willingly even bring something like that to the table. I’m sorry, but if they had any human decency, they would never do that to you. My parents avoid the conversation of sex with me as much as possible because it’s embarrassing on both ends. I guess were a little conservative in that way, but it’s alright with me. The only time they should get involved is if you’re into CP, which of course is illegal and disgusting. I had a similar experience: I won’t go into details but it was with just my mom and we don’t talk about it but she always alludes to it when we argue as a way to “get back at me” or make me feel horrible. But we aren’t horrible for being human and having these feelings and thoughts, especially at our age. We shouldn’t be ashamed of that. 

My advice to you is to not talk about sexuality with parents like that and find something you’re passionate about. I’m pretty ADHD in terms of finding what makes me happy, but stuff like drawing, writing, and music lifts my mood or at least distracts me from the things that weigh my heart down. 

I don’t know what else to say. I’ve been suicidal since I was thirteen and attempted suicide once and OD probably five times, but it’s because of my mental health more so than any experience. I think of suicide almost everyday, but there’s other times where I think of my future without that involved. That gives me a little hope. There’s still a piece of me that really believes that someday I will go to college, get a job, have a few pets and hopefully live contently. Not happily necessarily, but peacefully.

Know that it’s not you, you’re not making up this hunger in your head, it’s not your fault, your body is just getting what it needs. Once it reaches a weight it is comfortable with (which is usually a healthy weight) and begins to trust you again, you won’t feel the need to binge eat anymore. But once you start restricting again, the cycle continues. You’ll be so hungry you’ll binge more. So... don’t do that.

rant,fhlyaqi,t1_fhls8av,1581706139.0,"I’m a suicide survivor and although I’m aware that is true in some cases, the majority of us feel guilty as hell when it comes to leaving our close ones. Honestly, it may be the most painful feeling in the world — wanting to leave so bad, but remembering that you won’t be able to watch your niece grow up, thinking of who is going to find you when you’re dead, wondering how the hell your sister is going to deal with your forever absence... a lot of the time the only thing keeping us alive is the thought of how much despair our family and friends would be in if we were gone. I think if someone was truly alone in the world, they would be able to pass peacefully. 

That is why reaching out for help is so important. That is why it is so stressed to listen to what a suicidal person has to say and to just be there with them when things get really hard. We are horribly lonely, and I believe if there was someone to talk to me before I attempted, if someone pleaded for me not to and truly showed that they cared, even if they only said, “please don’t do this, I care so much about you”, I would have paused for a moment and second guessed my decision. Because we don’t want people to ever feel the pain we felt.

I was prescribed that exact amount and I was literally brain dead for weeks. It made me so tired and desensitized. I went to a doctor, not a psychiatrist, and I don’t think she really knew what she was doing. If you’re worried about it, I would recommend you to ask them to put you on Prozac instead. Just 20 mg worked for me and those drowsy and low-brain function affects weren’t there.

Why don’t you try to go see a therapist that specializes in eating disorders or food addiction? I’m positive that it would make some sort of healthy impact. Even if you think all of it is shit, at least it’s a good start. Might take some strong encouragement but I’m sure that it would be worth it either way.

SuicideWatch,fbhpbtr,t3_ed9ci5,1576879163.0,"I am so sorry. I probably shouldn’t say anything, since I have extreme body dysmorphia as well and I’m also a perfectionist. Almost anything and everything gives me anxiety. I have attempted suicide before and the mental health professionals suspected OCD in me as well, but I never willingly opened up to the obsession about my body and face and I literally can’t walk past a mirror without looking in it. Average isn’t good enough for me — I need to be perfect. All the time. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? As long as I’m completely in control, I’m okay, but once I gain a bit of weight or a little acne, I want to die again. I cannot imagine having scars all over my face, and it also being my fault. I would seriously despise myself. 

But here’s the thing — have you ever tried spiritual practices? Have you ever researched past lives, current lives, and future lives? I don’t know if you are into that kinda thing, but even if it’s not real, it may make you feel better.

Each life that you live is one to teach you something. Maybe this life is trying to teach you how to love yourself for who you are, despite the worst of the worst happening. And if you kill yourself, you’re going to fail that lesson. And the next life is probably going to be the same. The zodiac is intertwined with this. There’s a sun, rising, and moon. Whatever sign is your sun sign is like the one that you’re set out to learn for this life. The moon represents your past life. It is likely in the next life your sun and moon sign will be the same if you kill yourself. Mine is the same — I’m a cancer sun, rising, and moon. Part of that means that I didn’t complete whatever goal I was supposed in my last life and I’m supposed to try again. I suspect I lived a similar life as I do now many times before. And I think that I’m learning a similar lesson as you, because I attempted suicide a lot and have many of the same challenges.

This is kinda pointless if you aren’t spiritual and don’t believe in any of that bullshit, but I really think you should research it. I’m in no way in any religion, I’m kinda torn between my beliefs actually, but it is kinda nice to live this life thinking that there’s a goal I’m chasing and I might finally achieve it if I try hard enough. Silly, I know, but it helps with my “perfectionist” mindset. I hope you will try to heal your soul by combating this challenge and difficult life. You will be happier — in this life and in the next.

My friend says she’s here for me but never reaches out and I sent her a poem that was quite sad and she responded that it was a “sweet poem”. I told her it was sad not sweet and she didn’t answer so obviously she didn’t care to even click on the link. I fucking want to die.
SuicideWatch,f9woxlx,t1_f9we38v,1575696265.0,Are you judging me? About something as fragile as suicide? Are you going to make me feel bad for my suicide attempt and not “trying hard enough”? Well when you’re not really there and your brain is foggy and you’re forgetting things every five minutes I’m sure you wouldn’t be thinking straight. I was also 14 years old. Putting me down on how I executed things about SUICIDE. You are a heartless motherfucker
SuicideWatch,f9w1ao5,t1_f9w14z4,1575685288.0,"I’m sorry😬
I wish I could regret it."
SuicideWatch,f9w10t7,t1_f9vxd4q,1575685112.0,"I survived a suicide attempt and don’t really regret it. It sounds so stupid but I would do it again and try harder next time. The only ones who regret it are the ones who don’t wanna die anymore. All it did was gain me more knowledge on what not to do — don’t tell your sister you took a bottle of pills. Damnit, if I didn’t do that I probably would’ve died"

BodyDysmorphia,f9qthii,t1_f9qqh9u,1575566684.0,"You’re absolutely beautiful and honestly as someone who suffered with BDD I don’t condone this post at all. I don’t think only one percent of us are beautiful. I think at least fifty percent are attractive but we don’t see it. Please be confident, this is just a way for this person to release their frustrations on others and comfort themselves by saying that we are all average or downright ugly which just ain’t true."
