I tried watching kpop songs but still not hook with it.  Maybe because growing up, i'm a big fan of one direction. Until recently, Sf9 was one of our subject at work. I got curious, heard some of their music, had a personal background about them, finish ""Extra-ordinary you"" in just one seat, fell inlove with Rowoon and currently got addicted to their music! Now Dawon is taking my heart too. üò±  My favorite songs are Dear Fantasy, Mamma Mia and Sole Mio.  I'll be attending #2019SF9LIVEFANTASY2UNIXERSE in Manila!  See you there!  üòçüòç"

selflove,f2dkz65,t1_f1zlqh3,1570157021.0,"Actually me and some other people are the one who are telling those words. One time,  an old man ask me if I already have a children. I said no,  I don't have any children or even a husband. Then the old man told me that he don't believe me because I looked like a married woman with 2 children. What hurts me is that he told me those words in a angry tone. That time, I was so speechless and just smile. 

Also,  some of my relatives always telling me that I'm getting bigger and bigger that I need to loose some weight. Hahaha


Gaining weight makes me feel ugly but I can't help it because I tend to gain weight when I'm stress or depress but I am still thankful knowing that all of my friends or some strangers still find the beauty in me,  inside and out.

Btw, thank you! I really appreciate your comforting words. üòçüòç Godbless you!"
