If they are freash wounds, dont mention them, but just ask if they are ok and let them know your available if they need some support.
If you point them out or shoe pitty they will shut down.  And be less likely to talk or reach out to anyone."

You had to live in the flat for more then two years before i could be on the tenency. The houseing services found me a place to live in an under 25's homeless accommodation, because of my disability they made sure i was in a place with similar ages people, to ensure i would be safe. 

I moved in wirh £10 in my pocket, to a place miles away from my family. No support what so ever (i fell out of the catchment area for the servics for my disability)  i had given my cats for a friend to look after. I balled my eyes out, had a panic attack and self harmed.

The place was not safe. There was regular drug use, violence and the ammount of times the fire brigade and the police came out was ridiculous!! And one of the people in the building was arressed and sentenced to jail after raping a girl who then trided to kill herself. 

I was living there for 2 and a half years. My cats come with me several months later when a psychiatrist wrote a letter saying my cats where imortant to my health. 

I eventualy found a flat after several supportig letters where sent because my health was deteriorating because of the constant anxiety and the police i found out were planning a drug raid on the building but wanted me out. Because of my state of health.

I dont know how i coped but i had alot of intencive support to keep me some what sane. On the positive side i received alot better help and support by moving into the area.

P.s the building only housed 4 homeless people age 16- 25"

I get really angry at:
-scientific inaccuracies( e.g vacines cause autism ect)
- any type of discrimination/ injustice
-anyone who talks crap about prople with mental health issues/Autism/ Self Harm and Substance misuse issues(i my self and close family have experiences this)

Its not something i can logicaly say to myself that i shouldnt get angery about because most of it is something to get angery about. I dont go out much for fear of just upseting myself as everywhere i go i seem to get so angry and upset"

BorderlinePDisorder,evziugh,t3_cltf45,1564958732.0,"Dissociation it self can be split into several categories:  dissociative amnesia,dissociative fugue, derealisation, depersonalisation, identity alteration, identify confusion. You can take a look at them all here 
www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociation-and-dissociative-disorders/#.XUdd1R7TU0M

I exporeoence derealisation and depersonalisation on a regular basis. I exprence out of body exprences.,Not being able to move or talk, seeing/feeling parts of my body are not real, seeing that the area around me isnt right. Peoples faces morphing into my abuser. To me thw most scary is not being able to move or talk, this often happens in thereapy or i am confronted by something the triggers me immencely, my body essentially shuts down/plays dead. As that is how i got by. 

HOWEVER, there are lots of tipd or tricks to help. I  am tactile and touching or feelimg things can help me ge out of a dissociative state. (Touching a object like a soft toy, tapping fingers or feet. Splashing cold water, peting a cat. Playing with slime  ect) its about finding what works.. hope i helped, any questions just ask :)"

However today we know its not trie and ASD presents more subtlely and diffrent in women. It takes twice as long to diagnosis and most women  don't get piked up because of this
BorderlinePDisorder,ev2myr9,t3_ci4o0v,1564179992.0,"No i don't. I have bpd and i have siblings on the Autism Spectrum Disorders, i have worked with people with autismand i have friends with autism. Although i can see some overlap in certain areas the conditions are different. However in some cases this is true. I know for a fact (Although it had been suggested i do) that i do not have an Autism Spectrum Disorder that i fully and completely fit the diagnosic criteria for BPD. I know this because i grew up amd continue to work with people on the spectrum. Most of my friends are autistic because they tell me how they feel and if i have upset them, this is a great gor me as i know where i sand and dont have to panic and stress about if a persob hstes me. I find its easyer to trust them. And im crap at socialising with  'normal people'. :)"

 last year got my flu vaccine as i have asthma.. i was in my art class and another woman said she felt ill after her flu jab. I (being me full of fun science facts) said 
""did you know you cant get flu from the flu jab because it isnt active, however your body can produce flu like symptoms because your immune system is active so it can recognise the virus"".  
This hippy dippy man had to have his say. 
"" well thats your opinion but they are infact poison"". I was shocked those man was usually so 'inteligent'.i said
