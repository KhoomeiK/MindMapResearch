His motivations could have been anything from saying he wanted to be friends but not really sincerely, to actually wanting to keep you a bit on a string, to going thru some stuff that leaves him completely unavailable right now. Or something else but...

What you are describing isn't a friendship. You don't need to be contacting him over and over when he isn't reciprocating. And anyway, I'm not sure how either of you would expect to move on if you were engaging all the time. 

I've been friends with exes, I've had exes I hope to never speak to again. But in the case of the former, our friendship came to be well after we broke up. Neither of us were waiting around for it to happen. If we were, we'd just be doing that same dance that didn't work in the first place.

He was sometimes bumbling, a little socially awkward, and was great at missing opportunities for himself. None of that was ill-willed and none of it made him worse at his job than any of his colleagues. 

He was also earnest, and lost his good job thru absolutely no fault of his own. Even though he was a good and dedicated employee, no one bothered much about it. People bent over backwards to help other servants down on their luck, or giving them thousands of chances after they screwed the pooch. (Uh Ethel much?)  For Molesley Isobel basically gave him a kick in the ass on the way out the door.

It was gross how Carson humiliated him while he begged for a job. The Dowager's attempt to help was sweet as usual but really, really half-assed.

But the covert who hung from my neck for a decade? Yea that took everything I had to figure out and kick to the curb. Unlike the overts who blustered, he made much more nefarious threats and followed thru on some. And he's still trying to get at me after years on no contact. 

Ive never been in a relationship with an overt so I don't want to minimize that. Obviously there are plenty who are Incredibly dangerous and can hold onto people with all kinds of methods, violent and otherwise.

The much crappier behavior of insulting replies or even just initating insults is plenty prevalent.

When I am around my straight friends and at straight bars (I'm on a blue dot so that's a privilege), I meet new people more easily, people are more conversational and open to people they don't know. If I go somewhere new and say I'm from out of town, I'll often get welcomed,  invitations to do things, tips for around town. At gay bars, once in a blue moon I've had this (which is a joy)...but far more often its cliques of guys who are standoffish. If I go with a crew of friends or someone I'm dating,  it's better because it's easier to ignore that. But its still bothersome to me.

S20 on the Samsung Keyboard (only) has some great taptics. Interestingly, the good stuff is on delete and alternative  character choice. Space still feels like just heavy vibration to me. Regular keys just feel like extra soft vibration and not that more realistic tap that have. But of course, that could be me.

The settings toggle feedback in amazing  camera too. 

 Haptics are one of those subtle improvements that can make a experience difference especially combined with other cues. It's not the kind of stuff Android phones are exactly known for. I had no idea why it could be an improvement until I borred a friend's iPhone X for the first time, and in my head I was sheepishly like... ""oh."" 

I'm very impressed for the S20's haptic motor and implementation, altho of course it's not quite the same as iPhone and no one would expect that anyway (iPhone has gotten the button-push feeling to a very high level of realism.) 

What holds back the S20 haptics tho is that the good stuff is able to be used in One UI and the Samsung Keyboard, etc. So if you are wanting to use another launcher, and we know you are wanting to switch keyboards, you just feel the regular old vibration style.
