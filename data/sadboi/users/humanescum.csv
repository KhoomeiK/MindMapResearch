That's a very good tip. I might be scared of losing myself even more though. Did you take your phone/computer with you? Or were you completely shut off from things?"

lexapro,es42vvb,t3_c5qp9v,1561575934.0,No difference
lexapro,es2s030,t3_c5m5o2,1561537335.0,"It's good to filter depression out because indeed, the two can look like one another. Less interest, passiveness, inattentiveness. But, at the same time there's a big comorbidity of depression when you have adhd. This partly may comes with the feeling that you dont fit in, that you're different, not able to follow. And depression at its turn can make the adhd worse, you get even more inattentive and chaotic. 
I guess it's a good thing your doctor wants to make sure it isn't 'just' depression but tbh they could also look into your past and childhood and run other tests to see if it could be adhd. The statement they said goodbye with is just inaccurate and lazy to me. Is it possible to find another doctor, maybe one specialized in adhd?
I take lexapro and because I have depression that worsens my attention span even more, it helped. But the lexapro alone is not enough for me. 
I'd very much hold onto figuring out what's exactly wrong. Dont give up!"

Serving cliches here but it's no use to compare yourself to others as your journey is unique to you and only you. A thought that might only make sense to me: if you put all factors, your opportunities and disadvantages together that make your life your life, there is only one outcome and that is my life as it is. I think everyone does there best within the knowledge and power that they have, and if anyone else would've had to operate in my circumstances, I know that the outcome would've been exactly the same."

CancerFamilySupport,es06cou,t3_c4yyru,1561467076.0,"My father was 53 when he was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer. He was given 12 months to live, but was with us for 11 very hard months. The prognosis for this cancer isn't good. However, there sometimes are cases that outlive this peniable prognosis. Most people think it'll be them outliving their prognosis and that's ok. Hold onto hope until her/your last breath; it's not what saves you but it makes a it less unbearable. In my language they say 'as long as there's hope, there's life'. I wish you, your mom, your family all the strength possible. Sending love from Belgium"

lexapro,ernv9wf,t3_c30fru,1561061873.0,20mg doesnt work as good for me anymore either. My psychiatrist says that chances are big that the side effects would outweigh the pro's if the dose would be upped. It also heightens the chance of seizures. I would definitely ask the guidance of a dr before changing anything. Maybe it's time to try something else.

I wish you and your family all the courage."
lexapro,erms7an,t3_c2mu50,1561035561.0,"I take 20mg as well.   
I don't feel like it's being said that it's impossible, it's just way harder for the majority of people. Especially in the beginning and especially on higher doses. For me it got better over the years, you learn about the new ways in which your body works and you get in a way used to it; but for me it's still not the same as before."
