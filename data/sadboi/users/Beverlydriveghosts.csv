Go to a different doctor and tell THEM what you want. I found this worked better than telling my symptoms and waiting for a recommendation. 

It also depends what issues you’re having, The therapy may have worked if it was mild symptoms, but it’s not gonna help if you wanna kill yourself right there. Sometimes 1 to 1 therapy can be more helpful it depends.

The story is also anchored in realism, particularly in the children's racist remarks and behaviour towards the narrator and Jenny (they protest them having first pick of crayons etc). Also kids are fuckin weird- ""I spoke to my balls every night"" yep, that's realistic of kids, as well as being metaphoric. These factors make the message of racism so much more effective.

Not only that, but there's a demonstration of the effects of that internalised racism on the minority narrator in the form of shame and a rejection of one's identity. This is seen in the metaphors where the narrator wishes his nails to be cut down to the quick, and the scraping of dirt from under their nails. The only member of the classroom who recognises narrator's beauty for what it is, dark skin and all, is the fellow minority. The narrator cannot reciprocate because they are too occupied with rejecting their sense of self. The narrator would rather live in the pain of the light in their eyes, as long as it means their picture on the wall looks of a lighter skin tone. This metaphor could be applied to all manner of situations, but particularly speaking out against racism: Jenny would rather speak up about the light in her eyes, hence the truth always won.

offmychest,fnfsaaw,t3_g1gdvb,1586914408.0,"I’m not going to diagnose you with OCD, I’m just going to describe where your experience falls in line with it. Maybe you can do your own research. 

1) The initial worrying symptom
2) intrusive thought (obsession) what if that means I have cancer? What if they missed it last time? 
3) anxiety feeling “I have to go to the doctor to check” 
4) compulsion- going to get checked out/ checking online to see if your symptoms match up with cancer/ asking friends or family if they think you have cancer 
5) temporary relief 
Back to 1

Some people completely manifest their symptoms. So when you have physical symptoms and you have websites telling you that as symptom of cancer, and a doctor that can’t say for 100% that it’s not either, you can understand why your brain goes “aw shit here we go again”. It’s that uncertainty and fear that feeds the cycle. 

When you don’t fear it anymore it loses its power over you. You don’t go to the doctor therefore you don’t maintain the cycle of OCD. 

This happened to me with my obsession. The funny thing is tho is that this bitch will come back in a different form (if it’s not cancer it’s psychosis if it’s not psychosis it’s something else) so it’s best to fight it at the source. Maybe talk to your doctors about the possibility of getting some therapy otherwise I think this will just continue to come back again and again. 

There is absolutely the possibility you just get migraines like many other people in the world. But until you deal with the obsessive thoughts about the cancer you won’t be able to live normally"
offmychest,fnfqd5y,t3_g1gd2e,1586913272.0,"I can absolutely understand that your brain has made this connection between watching porn now and the traumatic experiences with porn at a young age.  

I’m gonna be quite presumptive in this comment but I kinda need to. So disregard if there’s anything you disagree with I’m just going by what you’ve put. 

You need to remove this black and white thinking. That porn is bad and it made me this way and when I watch it it makes me a bad person/ brings out the bad side of me. 

It’s not the porn. You have an unhealthy relationship with it but fearing it and avoiding the actual issue isn’t going to help. 

You say there are things you’ve never talked about, that youll take to your grave? These things that are so awful to speak aloud, they feel like they’ll crush you. What good is keeping this evil inside? To tear you apart and keep you awake at night? 

Your question of how you move on from trauma is a difficult one that some paid psychologists can’t fully figure out since it’s different for everyone. All they know is when you dig deep into what happened, pull the horror out, lay it on a table in front of you and say “yep that’s how it is. That happened” You will probably be able to move on and have a healthy relationship with sex and porn. When you make the connection between the self harming behaviour of wanting to be an object and used and abused, and the actual trauma.

There is nothing wrong with the kink you describe. There are ways it cane be explored in a healthy way and it doesn’t make you fucked up for wanting that. However, where it gets murky, is where you want it almost against your will, and to be hurt as a punishment, as self harm. All I’m hearing is guilt and shame. Why would you feel this way If it was truly enjoyable and consensual?

This isn’t you. You’re not a monster you’re not an evil product created from porn. You’re a person with deep rooted issues that cannot cope with them alone, so it’s manifesting itself elsewhere. I always think that the things we repress or just push into the back of our mind ALWAYS come back. They’ll come back in different forms but it’s the same bitch every time. 

I’m sure you’ve received some amount of catharsis from posting this, if you have that’s a positive view that talking about this may help you recover from it. Just talk about it man that’s all you can do"
offmychest,fnfnjsl,t3_g1g00s,1586911625.0,"I think it’s normal to have repressed these memories. When children go through things that are too traumatic to process they literally don’t and completely forget them. Sometimes those memories come back and sometimes they don’t. 

Don’t worry about whether these things come back to you, because they haven’t yet. Don’t worry about things that haven’t happened that doesn’t help anyone. 

I’m not surprised that you didn’t realised how fucked things were cause you grew up around that- why would you think it’s weird if it’s all you’ve ever known. 

It’ll all come to a head in time. You’ll be able to put it all behind you and move on. That might not be now but it’ll eventually happen. Mainly try and accept what you know. Things weren’t normal and that’s just how it is. But you’re here and breathing and you’re aware the behaviour is wrong so you won’t imitate it"

It appears as a poem about mourning but the line “the way I’ve made us hurt” makes me think it’s a breakup poem so I’m not entirely sure. The narrator feels at fault for this pain/ death so it wasn’t an accident/ natural? Not sure.

depression,fm2vk4i,t1_fm2usrk,1585706410.0,"I love reading /r/latestagecapitalism and /r/antiwork for some of what you said. 

And I know- you’d rather die than go to work but not being at work makes you feel so guilty you also wanna die. 

It’s re-evaluation time. What do I rly wanna do? What do I really need to survive and thrive and be happy? The media tells me I need this specific product- but it’s all bullshit. I don’t wanna go back to doing this. I’m thinking of switching up my plans- of going into a high pressure but well paying job- all up. 

When you’ve lost everything you’re the most free cause they’ve nothing left to take from you- so fuck it lol let’s hope this shit lasts as long as possible"
