personalfinance,fo9m25h,t3_fkyu8h,1587623548.0,"Hi, I survived a round of major layoffs but have had my salary cut significantly – by 20% along with many non-salary benefits such as extended learning and fitness expenses (obviously in these times.) I work at a tech company but am still young in my 20's and paying rent for a one bedroom in Los Angeles on my own. I am pretty frugal regardless and have a savings account. However, thinking about how I'm going to pay for monthly rent with this significant pay cut is starting to concern me. Is it unethical or reasonable to ask my landlord if she will negotiate a lower rent for a few months? I don't want to have to pack up and move apartments or back home right now when it comes down to it. Meanwhile, I am continuing to save and look for other jobs, though I feel like prospects will be low and salaries will be about the same, if not lower. What are your thoughts?"
MadeMeCry,fk9w3go,t3_fgz1l2,1583985023.0,This hurts. I hope the Uber driver is reported and there is justice for this.
identifythisfont,fk9bapp,t1_fk5vm7g,1583972550.0,yes this is it! thank you so much.
Anxiety,fjg1qsi,t1_fj6ujq0,1583307719.0,Yes! My only socialization that actually pulled me out of this hump was having my dad drive across time and come over for 5 min to help with a house fix-up. We then planned for lunch after and it amazingly pulled me right out of it. Like it never happened.
Anxiety,fjg1nrn,t1_fj6sfjq,1583307626.0,"Wow. This thread just ties into so many other underlying issues I’m working with. I always try to work towards minimalism and letting go of clutter but I have such trouble with it. I’ve read and watched all of kondo mari, listened to minimalism podcasts, have had cleaning out my house on my to do list for years now and can’t do it. Recently debating making a drastic move to NYC and thinking about living in a tiny space scares me but excites me at the same time, would be forced to live with less and have a richer intentional life. Again the hoarding and saving has so much to do with my immigrant parents and how we grew up. Buy cheapest, keep everything in case, waste nothing. Just can’t get past the initial hump, but the way you phrased it is really eye opening. Would also  probably help with my tardiness and “busy mind.”"
Anxiety,fjg182g,t1_fj5zwxu,1583307134.0,"Any reccos for social activities that aren’t primarily social? I’ve given a ceramics studio a shot for a few months, but I still had anxiety. I got through it and made some stuff but ultimately it wasn’t my thing. Used to try going to dinners, concerts, gallery openings and receptions alone, but I could only fixate on how alone I was and didn’t know how to interact with anyone or myself There. Pure discomfort and feel like the entire world is aware of how out of place and alone I am, even though nobody actually cares."
Anxiety,fjg0tcw,t3_fbq6n2,1583306677.0,"Additionally, intensely relate to the small windows of time fucking me over. I plan so much that sometimes I’m too early and it’s what to do with that window of time that paralyzes me and makes me late. I’m chronically tardy no matter how hard I try and it is exclusively due to anxiety and having to come to terms I’m going to need to leave the house. Or the awkward windows of time.

On Sunday at brunch, we planned to meet at 12:30. I left my house at 11:15 to pick up some flowers for my sister in law and realized id still be an hour early so I ended up doing some “pre-grocery” shopping to make productive use of my time. Ended up being stuck in line, in traffic, and showing up 30 min late feeling like a piece of shit the entire time.

But maybe I’ll move this into a tardiness/time management thread i find."
Anxiety,fjg0l6r,t1_fj9euvp,1583306428.0,"Yes exactly. If someone else is involved there’s so much at stake but if it’s just me I’ll waste the entire day and can only blame myself. If someone invites me out for lunch, I’ll have “wasted” 3-4 hours of my precious day I’ll never get back. Then I think, how selfish and self centered can i be? My family invited me out to brunch (not knowing the state I was in) and I was distraught at the thought of hanging to pick a time that worked for 5 people, then a restaurant we all could agree on, with us coming from 3 different parts of town. Went back and forth and told them I’m really busy and don’t know if I can afford to spend half my day traveling across town to have a meal together.

But hey, I agreed to it and it got me out of the house finally. By default I started my day early and after I was out of my house I tackled a bunch of things: grocery shopping for the week, stopped by my studio and worked straight for 6 hours on a personal project I’d been putting off for months, then was so motivated I came home and didn’t plop on the couch. Tackled the pile of dishes, even bleached my god damn shower tiles. I gotta say, this week feels fucking great because I got out of that funk. Once I’m out of the house, I’m up and running and can’t stop. Just stood in line in the cold for 3 hours to vote for the primaries surrounds by strangers and felt such a comraderie I didn’t mind it at all. Once I’m out of the funk and busy again jam packing my week with errands and socialization, I’m completely fine again. It’s when I fall into the hole that it takes forever to come out of it. Or triggered by something."
Anxiety,fj71xtw,t1_fj635bb,1583084784.0,"Yes exactly this. The virus and paranoia going around is heightening this anxiety. My parents are extremely paranoid people, my moms been all my life. I love her and try to just chuckle about it and shake my head / dismiss it but it finds its way to get to me, and I in turn inherit the paranoia secondhand if that makes sense. It’s exhausting.

My parents spent a whole weekend driving around town to find face masks a month ago when the virus first broke out. They were sold out everywhere, every single 99cents store, CVS, rite aid, Home Depot, Target. I thought they were crazy and they finally found a Home Depot and wiped the shelves clean. I had been visiting them at the time and ended up being dragged on that terrible adventure to find the masks with them.

They text me constantly when they’re at Costco, pictures of shelves wiped clean of rice, hand sanitizer, water, toilet paper, oil.... i reject it and get annoyed they pollute my mind with paranoia but then get sucked into it in the end. They won’t stop sending news articles, I live in koreatown and they tell me to not go out to eat or grocery shop because of the false article with a Korean Air flight attendant. I know that all this behavior is ludicrous and all we need to do be is be cautious and wash hands frequently and not live in fear. But here I am, locking myself in my house for 3 days straight. Half due to this funk/depression I’m in (which I can’t discern from laziness) and half thinking about how unnecessary it is to go out with a virus going around (parents got to me.)

Meanwhile everyone else is living their life, going on dates, concerts, shopping, and I’m just at home in isolation all from my own doing. I even decline dates because I think about how on the outside I seem super outgoing and charismatic, but behind closed doors I’ve got some heavy baggage going on. The last thing I want to do is drag someone into it."
