BPD,fq9eg45,t3_ghh9ky,1589195574.0,"Yup. It's why I don't tell my friends when I feel crappy or down deep in the hole depressed.

I know one of the reasons why I constantly feel this way is because of how I was raised: Emotions were rarely allowed. I was always told not to tell anyone how I feel because it'll be used against me, it's none of their business, and no one really cares. I'll just be a mad attention-seeking whore, and no one wants that. Plus, who knows, I might just be faking it---it's all in my head, right?

But one of the things you have to remember is that you just have to trust your gut sometimes. When you feel that person is your friend--someone you feel who won't judge you and be there for you--it's okay to reach out. Venting online helps sometimes, but having an actual friend whom you connect with feels 100x better.

It's easier said than done, but don't listen to the trickery of the voices in your brain. You're not your BPD. YOU are worth it. ‚ù§"

This was the episode that had me jaw dropped because of how beautiful, simple, and just heartwarming it was! And yet, when you think about the whole story of the episode, it was anything but. It was a story of struggling--finding courage, heart, and brains. It really showed the life in and out of the hospital as health care workers. Personal or career, there are always struggles, you just gotta find the right person to lean on when they happen. Very touching and lovely episode.
