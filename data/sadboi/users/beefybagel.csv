lonely,evywc1v,t1_evys6cu,1564943017.0,"I’m sorry to hear that. No one should have to censor their bodies just to feel safe and comfortable around others. I hate it. It fucking sucks. I personally love wearing tight clothing and showing my skin. I feel most comfortable that way. However people ruin it with their blatant stares and vile remarks. I go to college in NY so walking around by myself (which is 80% of the time) can be scary and intimidating. Sometimes I’m so self conscious about the attention my body gets that I even walk differently so certain parts don’t move. Sometimes I dress differently too. 

As much as I HATE conforming, our safety is important too. Although one’s clothing is never to blame for sexual assault and/or harassment, there are some precautions we have to make. I wear my AirPods all the time whenever I’m walking alone to avoid talking to people. It drowns out the catcalling and lets people know not to fuck with me. Of course it doesn’t always work, but at least I have something else to focus on. Find a way to tune people out, be aware of your surroundings, and be as assertive as you need to be to protect yourself. 

You are most likely relationship material. I honestly don’t know why the life is depriving us in such a way. Keep being yourself in the safest way you can. You’re valid and worthy. I’m trying to affirm that myself as well. Good luck and talk to me whenever."
lonely,evysk94,t1_evyqfnt,1564940358.0,"You are so right. Society has a significantly heavy influence that’s seriously fucking people up. Including myself. When I started college this year, I worked hard to discover my own identity and be comfortable in my own skin. It just sucks that I get harassed while trying to achieve it. Now that I’m growing up and having new experiences, I try not to rely on validation from others. However when people seem to only want sex from me, it makes me wonder... what the fuck is wrong with me?

You’re providing great advice. It does get old after awhile. I can’t even lie tho, I didn’t have any interest in having a serious relationship with the people I was sexually involved with. I think it’s mainly because it was clear that they didn’t want that in the first place. So I’ve always kept things casual- even now. Part of me is perfectly okay with that. The other part wants more. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. When I don’t make any effort to find a partner, nothing happens. When I do make an effort to find a partner, nothing happens. I’ve been waiting on the Universe to do its thing but nothing has happened. Now I’m here, regretting letting certain people into my life, and scared of opening up for more disappointment.

Depending on someone financially and disguising it as love or interest is pretty messed up. I hope I never find myself in a situation like that.

Not everyone can afford to live on their own just because they don’t get along with their family. If he infuriates you THIS much, then obviously having any contact with him isn’t your first choice. You’re just doing what you have to do until you can thrive on your own- better than killing him. I’d keep as much distance from him as possible and tune him out with anything you’ve got.
