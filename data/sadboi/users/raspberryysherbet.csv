- User is annoyed by ads
- Spotify promotes premium, which includes no ads 
- User subscribes, because ads are awful
- Spotify earns profit based on monthly subscriptions

Do you have any advice about the falsetto part too? That’s especially tough for me to nail, as well as the sort of “grunt” that she does in the bridge. I decided not to try that as it never works out when I try, but it’d be nice to learn how to do that."
