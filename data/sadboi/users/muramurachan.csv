I don't know when this started, but change isn't going to be instant. It seems like he is growing to express his love for you more this recent month, so it could be the first effects of this individual therapy and might be more permanent than you think.

>I feel horrible for wanting more when he isn't capable of more.

That is a pickle, and I've been there. My boyfriend still need his own space and gets anti-touch. Maybe there are things you can do instead? Physical touch sounds very important to you, but are there other ways like seeking comfort from a close friend? Or doing other non-physical bonding activities with him?

>I'm worried that if his depression finally goes away, what if he doesn't want a future with me anymore? His depression being gone doesn't mean he'll return to the same guy I fell in love with...

The truth is people change all the time. Even if he didn't have depression there is still no guarantee 1, 2, 5, 10 years from now he would be the same person who loves you the same way. Change is part of lifelong relationships, and adapting is how people stay together. While having a depressed partner sucks it can also be rewarding. Say what? You heard me right: depressed people are still awesome people. I am more independent, self-aware, and empathic since choosing to stay with my boyfriend. Yah, I could have worked on these things without him but I don't think I could be the person I am today without him in my life for these past 4 years. He has taught me a lot about depression, life, and pain without having to experience it myself. That gives me a deeper view of the world, and I can relate to other people who suffer from depression.

> I feel like I'm a dating a ghost.

My boyfriend also has social anxiety and hardly goes out. Only very specific things will get him out of the house, like hanging out with our mutual friends playing video games or meeting up for coffee. Anything with strangers, big groups, no way! So I understand where you're coming from. I think being insincere will end up hurting the issue, what if he found out from your family somehow that you said you were broken up? That would be devastating for him, especially since it seems like he is trying very hard to work through his depression. I think it's better just to call it what it is: he is depressed and he is working on himself. Hopefully your family can understand. Depression shouldn't be a shameful thing hidden and lied about, it's a condition many people have under the surface. And if we talk about it more without shame or blaming, it helps depressed people feel less weird and isolated and allows them to relate to others."

1. Younger children don't understand why they're being hit just that their caretaker suddenly hurts them.

2. Studies [show](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/health/spanking-harmful-study-pediatricians.amp.html%3f0p19G=3248) it isn't any more effective than other non-violent forms of discipline.

3. Even if beating was more effective for some kids, the mentally handicapped, autistic and otherwise sensitive children are severely traumatized by ANY physical contact, especially the negative kind.

Yes, some few kids grow up fine without any anger issues or relationship issues, but if you're a parent willing to gamble your kids' mental and emotional health because of your personal ethics, you don't deserve kids.

I have a lot to talk to him about, and I appreciate your input. I don't think I am gaslighting or saying my partner owes me anything, but that is an important thing to bring up because that's always a danger with topics concerning body autonomy. 

Perhaps my partner thinks more like you and the langauge I am using makes them think I'm saying they owe me something. The only thing I would like would be to come to an agreement rather than a rule that excludes consideration of my feelings. If he had said something like, ""I see where you're coming from.

Yes what we each do is individual and I'm not trying to ask for the same type of sex, but the same level of sexual freedom. Like he has no obligation to ejaculate ever, but when there's a rule that limits that with me seems like my freedom of sexual expression with him is being taken away to provide security for another relationship.

I also deal with his issue with ejaculating, so while he gets more time with me I am still stuck in the same boat. I personally don't care and enjoy sex anyway, and my metamour has expressed the same thing, so the rule doesn't make sense and seems to be a bandaid to solve a long-term issue.

We are not the same person so my partner and I have very distinct differences and cannot meet 100% of each other's needs all the time. I truly believe no one can understand you better than yourself. So, to use dating as an escape from loneliness seems like it doesn't actually address that loneliness, just distracts you from it.

I found what works best for me is to find peace in being alone. Solidarity makes me strong and unique, I walk my own path with confidence. I am my best friend so when I am suffering alone I am always the first person to say, ""be kind to yourself."" I wouldn't have it any other way."

polyamory,fiuf6qp,t1_fiucl7e,1582740241.0,"Yes, I totally understand. And there are some ways to make it easier. It sounds like your partners are trying their own sympathy with your feelings, because maybe they can't fully understand you and how you think. That's awesome, and I'm glad they are giving you that support. Things to avoid are blaming or isolating language like, ""you don't understand me,"" or ""why don't you feel this way too?"" 

I've dealt with that kind of language and it is important to remain firm in your sympathy. It is okay to not understand or empathize sometimes because we are each individual and there are some things we just don't understand no matter how hard we try. 

For instance, I have never been suicidal, but one my partners and a couple metas have experienced suicidal thoughts. When a suicidal episode happens in our polycule, I am usually ""out of place"" because I can sympathize but I cannot empathize. The reality is I don't want to ever be able to empathize because I don't want suicidal thoughts, and I'm comfortable with that. That also means I won't truly understand anyone in that state, but I can offer help and listen to them."
polyamory,fiudcp0,t3_f9vcci,1582739274.0,"I totally understand, one of my partners has intense anxiety. I have to be careful that our plans don't affect his anxiety or put him in a potentially uncomfortable place. I understand why you want to be supportive but I also understand why your anxiety has spiked. 

Your home is your home and even though you might not consciously recognize it as a safe space, it probably is. So, when this guy whom you've never met is spending a whole week there with your wife, doing things you might be excluded from, that's a lot of stuff to process. 

I have a similar story. My school friend needed a temporary place to stay when he was moving across the country and looking for a new place. He asked me if he could stay over for at most a week, but it made my anxious partner very uncomfortable. We had our routine, and our one-bedroom apartment was his safe space. Luckily, my friend stayed overnight at a hotel and found a place the next day, so we never had any issues. 

So, I would suggest at least getting a hotel for a couple days. Then, try setting up a meeting with this guy so you can get to know him as a person rather than a name who is dating your wife. If you end up comfortable enough to let him into your home, then transition into it with clear and secure boundaries, like no loud sex when you're trying to sleep or excluding you in conversations, etc. It's all up to what you're comfortable with.

Just because you are uncomfortable with a new person in your home doesn't make you unsupportive. Working through your anxiety together with your wife is showing support because you're doing your best to make your wife's date awesome while also addressing your needs."
polyamory,fiub3ld,t3_f9wbfp,1582738178.0,"I am anchored/grounded and I'm solo poly so I tend to have unique opinions and feelings from my partners and metas. I'm more of the thinker and not the feeler, and this makes me feel a little isolated in my approach to feelings. I find I am the one arriving at a grounded or neutral state first during emotional turmoil, while my partners and their metas tend to take longer to process their emotions. It can be frustrating and isolating, and I've had my own struggle with feeling ""out of place.""

I do think that many people fall into this dilemma. Sometimes, we can't directly relate to someone because their response or issues are way beyond what we can personally empathize with. I think that's perfectly ok. You can still be sympathetic and emotionally available. Plus, your feelings of ""out of place"" are equally valid. If you decide to express those feelings with your partners, perhaps that will ease some of that feeling by allowing your partners to be there for you in return.

polyamory,fis95gc,t3_f9gehn,1582680406.0,"I find a few things and beliefs help with us, and I can outline them for simplicity:

1. Jealousy is a feeling and should be validated like any other feeling. Being jealous and having your partner ignore or otherwise invalidate that feeling just causes resentment and distrust.

2. Jealousy is the jealous person's responsibility. Meaning, if someone feels jealous it's on them to asses why they are jealous and to bring up any possible reasons or solutions.

3. Insecurities are human, we all have them.

4. Insecurities are not reasons or excuses. This especially pertains to rule-making. Just because someone is insecure with their relationship does not mean they can make a rule like ""no men allowed."" Address the insecurity, talk about it, express love and compassion, but do not place rules on other people because of personal insecurities.

5. We all make mistakes, let's learn to forgive each other.

I am currently working on #4 and #5. I'm lucky that my relationships don't have many rules, but we are working on a new dynamic with a quad (4 people poly group). With that there was a scare that people felt their individuality was lost in the group, so we ""broke up"" to be more individual-based. I am still in a relationship with one of them, with growing relationships with the other 2. We might not all be romantic with each other but we're at least on FWB level. You can imagine there is a lot of insecurity and mistakes being made all the time, having 4 people actively interconnected with each other is a crazy chat queue, but #5 helps us out a lot. At the end of the day, as long as no one did anything malicious, we forgive or we do #6:

*6.* Know when to move on. Sometimes, even with all the forgiveness and love, there are incompatible relationships. Just because poly means loving multiple people doesn't automatically make every relationship work. Sometimes people have different poly needs, sometimes people change, sometimes people give up or abuse someone, don't be afraid to move on when it's not working out. 

*7.* And after #6 and always: Love yourself! Love your feelings, insecurities, strengths, and weaknesses. Like Ru Paul says, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love somebody else. Can I get an Amen?"""

It seems you have wonderful relationships with both the husband and the wife, so I am curious about why the couple isn't discussing including you in their household. It might be because your relationship with them isn't as advanced as you think, or need, for that to happen. It might be that they have a boundary and consider you a secondary who will never live with them. 

So yes it might be that you never get your fantasy, but you can still have the relationship you currently have with them.

You're right that NRE can cause us to neglect established relationships. What he is doing to you is very painful and I cannot express how much I wish you could just take all the pain away with some simple action. The sucky and liberating thing is that you can't control his actions, but you have full autonomy over your own actions. And you do have options to make sure *you* are cared for.

What he is doing is not okay, and you don't have to wait for it to get better. It seems talking about it didn't work, but you can still make time for yourself and start healing yourself, do meditation or work on a hobby you neglected. Instead of going on dates with him, go on dates with yourself. You might find the pain reoccuring and the best way to heal is dropping the relationship, that's up to you.

So I hope you can focus on healing instead of the pain. It's horrible to be emotionally abandoned, but think about the strong person you were before any relationship. Think about all your positive qualities and accomplishments, all the shit you deal with and overcome, and don't let this tear you down."

Opening a relationship shouldn't be a quick thing. In fact, the most successful relationships I know of are people who start in stable relationships, have great communication, personal autonomy, and constantly check in with each other throughout the opening phase.

I am completely different than my partner, like night and day. We have our individual strengths and weaknesses, and to expect a single person to be enamored with both of us completely disregards how unique we are from each other. It also disregards what the third person wants or expects from a relationship, and it limits how relationships are formed.

By dating singularly, my nesting partner and I have found people who uniquely fit us and compliment our personalities. There is no pressure to have equality as a trio or as a couple with a unicorn, we have much more freedom. 

Funny thing, my partner might be starting a trio with one of their metamours, but that is because they all have had strong feelings for each other for a while (1 year). I find that this progression is usually more successful because there is more experience and maturity in all partners involved and the relationship evolves naturally.

Over the months, our friendship grew and grew to the point we could pretty much tell each other anything.

I believe social media like every facet of life should be regulated for children in order to teach them responsible behavior. That girl acting older and wearing risque outfits is not a good role model, teach the kids that. When someone tries to cyberbully anyone, report and block them. There are ways to use the Internet responsibly, but the issue is that most parents don't teach their kids these lessons.

I can agree to disagree with you on this. Take it what you will, but I don't agree with calling something homophobic when it isn't.

I do believe the language used in your example is homophobic because it cites gay people and ""normal"" dudes, saying these gay people don't speak ""normally"" and that's discriminating. The other examples not so much, but I can agree on this. The distinction is whether or not someone's statement is about gay people and not just a type of speech.

I am not making it my mission to counter every homophobic comment on Reddit. I don't think that would help anything, but I do plan on speaking up if I come across homophobic behavior in my daily life or if something on Reddit is hate speech."

I have a 4-year relationship and I've found that I feel better when I don't rely on my partner for emotional comfort. It sounds whacky but just hear me out for a second. When my partner isn't emotionally available, I turn to my friends, mom, and coworkers to rant about daily life. This gives my baseline emotions some validation. For more personal things I would only talk to my partner about, I journal them. I also talk to my own therapist. The only situation I feel like I NEED to talk to my partner is an emergency scenario like if either of us gets hurt or there is an unexpected change in finances, etc.

So, perhaps you can find a method that works for you that validates your feelings while also giving your partner some space.

unpopularopinion,fi474uk,t3_f6am7x,1582135313.0,"I can see why there is some confusion here and I've long believed that it is perpetuated on both sides, by men and women. 

1. Women are not objects no matter what they like, how they look, or what they say. They can be dumb as rocks and still they are human with feelings and opinions that might be crazy or inaccurate to you but they are still not objects. Therefore, treating them like sex objects is never right unless that is the specific sexual dynamic or kink you agree on beforehand.

2. Women, all people actually, should be clear in what they want and ask for clarification before getting offended. That's just basic communication skills. I personally believe men ask for what they want much easier and they often get burned by it. I have seen a woman get offended by one of my guy friends asking her where she got her dress because he thought it looked cute and he was thinking of buying it for his WIFE. It's like some women have over-inflated egos and think that every compliment or conversation revolves around their sex life.

3. If a woman ever feels threatened she should have the power to say ""no"" and leave, and that should be the end of it. Same with guys. No yelling or demeaning anyone, just leave it alone. So if a woman says no thanks and walks away, leave them the fuck alone and find someone else to talk to. There are a few exceptions like if someone is in your personal space and is overtly threatening then sure kick them in the groin. 

4. Society thinks sex is shameful. Maybe a guy just finds a woman hot and wants to approach her but only for sex. Sometimes the easiest and honest way to get what you want is to clearly ask for it. But when a guy asks for sex, that's demonized. Suddenly, they're a pervert. When a woman asks for sex, she's a slut. Stop shaming people for clearly communicating what they want and just say no if you don't want it. It isn't shameful to ask for sex, but it is wrong when someone keeps asking for sex after already being told no. Don't do it.

So women can be free in their sexuality, but not want to have sex with someone. They shouldn't be treated as an object just because they put on certain clothes or makeup. Clothes and makeup are part of an identity, it doesn't mean they aren't human. It is not okay to yell at or demean someone when they clearly and respectfully ask for sex, it is only wrong if they continue to do it after being told no. If a woman or anyone says no and walks away, clearly expressing they don't want any further conversation, let it go and don't pursue anything further.

On both sides, men and women seem to have large egos that get in the way of clear, respectful communication and it ends up hurting everyone."

depression_partners,fhfvyro,t3_f2xxen,1581552591.0,"Sorry you're going through this, sending lots of support for your family. Loving someone with severe depression is difficult, and can be very frustrating, and it's important to know when things have gotten out of hand so you can establish boundaries and techniques to validate your wife's feelings.

Do you guys do couples counseling? Or does she have a therapist? My long-term boyfriend and I started counseling a few months ago and he is currently searching for a private therapist because counseling helps him get out of his own head and start focusing on the present as it is, not how he sees it. A lot of people with depression experience alternate realities where the worst thing happens, people hate them, and everything someone says is an attack, and it's very difficult to get out of that mental state without help. Your wife might benefit from similar counseling, because it can be a huge burden for you and your family to always validate her feelings all the time and act like the family counselor.

I don't have children, but as a young woman myself I'm assuming your 2 older daughters are now grown adults and don't live with you (if they do then skip to the next paragraph). In this case, if your wife or your daughters choose to not interact that is their choice. You can make your opinions and thoughts known about the family situation, but who your wife or daughter chooses to keep in their life isn't something you can control. You can support all of them while they are not talking. It will take more effort but it can be done (my brother didn't talk to my step-dad for a while, and my mom still loved and supported both of them). 

As for your younger daughter (16), you can try to set boundaries in the house to ensure your daughter gets the love and comfort she needs. Like if your wife is experiencing an episode, ask her to relax in her room and don't expose your daughter to it. Or if your wife needs some space, maybe you and your daughter can go out to the mall or a movie? If your wife ever tries to yell or become violent, make it clear that it isn't allowed in the house and she can take it elsewhere. Also, make sure these rules are followed by all members of the household or else it just isolates your wife.

I don't know your wife's domestic situation but if she is a stay-at-home mom that could make depression worse. She should develop some hobbies, go out, and socialize. If you find she is becoming increasingly isolated, perhaps she'll benefit from a talk group or a local yoga class. When my boyfriend, who suffers from depression and social anxiety, and I started going out more he instantly became more cheerful and vibrant. We went to a bunch of parks, did some indoor yoga, and we're currently working on learning some new skills like advanced baking and cooking (he wants to be a pro chef). 

I find in my experience doing the above suggestions together makes depression easier to handle. However, if you're short on time or opportunity, encouraging your wife to start treatment either by seeing a therapist or working on a hobby will also help. It'll take a lot of patience and compassion, but I think you guys can pull through!"

But finding a quality partner requires you to be a good partner for someone, and a lot of people who blame their sex identity ignore that maybe the issue is with you. My boyfriend has 2 girlfriends and I have him. A lot of guys in open relationships have just as much success as their female counterparts, and if they're bi or pansexual sometimes even more so!

If you're trans, then there are benefits for switching to your preferred sex and gender. However, for people who aren't trans, saying one side has it better completely ignores what the other side deals with on a daily basis.

For instance, I'm biologically female and have had all the positives and negatives of that reality pushed on me because of it. Some people think that men have it better and they don't in many aspects. Many of the men in my life don't know how to cry or express emotion constructively, and there are some women who look down on that and call it ""immaturity."" It's not immaturity, it's a lack of opportunity, it's not knowing how. They weren't encouraged to express themselves and so now they don't know how as an adult.

Clothing is also female dominated. My boyfriend likes crossdressing sometimes in feminine clothes with earrings, makeup, and painted nails, but he constantly faces anxiety about how other people percieve him. He really wishes he could just wear whatever he wanted without being judged for it. As a woman, I can wear masculine clothes and no one will stare or ask if I'm a drag king. 

Additionally, the divorce courts are so skewed against men it hurts children. My friend who has a steady job and is responsible with his relationships and money lost a custody battle for his kid to his ex-wife who is a recovering drug addict and severely bipolar. After a year of divorce from a marriage full of emotional abuse, she still tries to blame him for all her problems and doesn't take responsibility for raising her kid. He's always the one who makes sure birthdays are planned, his kid's picked up and dropped off, etc. She can barely keep her shit together.

Second, the way that person sent that message does not take into consideration your feelings. You're right, people aren't replacements or need machines!

But we talked about it *in person* and I explained to him why it was important for my personal growth to explore that side of me and I expressed clearly I wasn't trying to replace him. We set some boundaries and we both learned from it. He has joined me in some BDSM activities now because he sees how happy it makes me.

The big difference is when your partner blatantly does things without consideration of your feelings. Everyone has a right to be happy and fulfilled, but to add another partner without 1) notifying other partners beforehand, 2) establishing any boundaries to make sure people already involved are okay and cared for and 3) hearing your partner(s)'s feelings out on the subject, it's just irresponsible and inconsiderate.

For instance, I rent an apartment and I can't just put a solar panel sticking out of my window. 

Now, if the infrastructure design and governing laws allowed it and solar panels were indeed allowed everywhere, I could see how your theory works out. If the energy grid was more localized and it was easier to connect new supply lines then solar would be like you described, easy and cheap.

unpopularopinion,fhbzptw,t3_f278uo,1581453281.0,"Hi, ex-Navy Nuclear Technician and current Defense/Energy Contractor here. 

To address some key points that people have brought up about nuclear waste, disposal, and true efficiency/cost:

I happen to work for a company that is researching fusion technology and nuclear waste management. There are [plans](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-general-atomics-nuclear-20160724-snap-story.html%3f_amp=true) to try and reuse nuclear waste, essentially re-purposing the left over uranium for smaller plant generators, reducing current waste by projected 97%. It also outlines smaller, more efficient reactors that won't cost what current civilian plants cost to build and maintain. Additionally, discoveries in fusion technology would eliminate waste all together due to the lack of radioactive materials generated by the process of fusion.

For those who think nuclear tech is inherently unsafe, news flash: Every U.S. Navy carrier and submarine is nuclear which in total numbers over 100 mobile reactor units scattered across multiple countries. Has any of those units ever experienced a meltdown since the start of the nuclear program in the 1960s? Nope. From a technician perspective, it is possible to operate a nuclear system safely with multiple redundancies and ""kill switches"" in place to prevent ever experiencing a meltdown. 

Now, there are challenges for civilian plants that naval fleets do not account for. Natural disasters, like what happened to Dai Ichi in Fukushima, caused 3 meltdowns. That was because their generators were taken out by the tsunami, and even with their redundancies and backup power supplies they still couldn't contain the incident. I totally agree that nuclear safety when it comes to potential natural disasters needs to improve to address this issue.

As for Chernobyl, that reactor was a completely different design than the current water-pressure reactors that make up the majority of civilian plants in the US. Chernobyl had a different fission process that made the reactor ""hotter"" and more reactive with a positive change in temperature, so when temperature went up due to more reactions, more reactions were made to the point of meltdown. Our current systems do the opposite, and so are inherently more stable and wouldn't meltdown like Chernobyl did.

Hope this gives some more perspective on nuclear energy from the technical side."

I believe intense fictional genres that require a large suspension of disbelief like fantasy and science fiction benefit from a strong, captivating introduction phase. Rising action is crucial in complex story lines that have many factors at play like a mystery and/or suspense/triller. A poor climax after awesome rising action has killed many a story (or HBO series), so climax can be argued for many stories that have an intense pace and capitvated audience. 

I would say second to resolution, the falling action isn't as important but still necessary for stories with a continuing plot or unresolved issues. It might provide further insight to the new character development or how the world has changed now the climax has happened. But both resolution and falling action are not as important as the others in my opinion."
