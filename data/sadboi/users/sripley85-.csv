Anxiety,fpe562x,t1_fpdil9e,1588540557.0,"You’ll never be alone, just post here..there’s always someone to talk to. Although we have our unique issues, we all have an understanding of anxiety (and depression as they generally go hand in hand). 
I also recommend the CBT therapy, it’s not a ‘cure’ by any means, but it gave me the tools to move forward. I still have dark days (and weeks) but I get through them with the tools that I’ve learnt."

Anxiety,foq559t,t3_g8v0l8,1587983366.0,"Yes, completely...I couldn’t put my finger on why I was feeling so anxious as I’ve adapted to the isolation situation. I think, for me, it’s all about change. When I’m in a routine, I feel better - not great, as my head always finds reasons to be anxious (GAD) - so I feel any change to any routine makes me feel bad again. Just as I’ve got used to one way, it changes. But that’s the challenge I guess."
Anxiety,fofq0mi,t3_g78nn7,1587740758.0,"Oh wow, that’s great! I did french at school, failed horribly. But, to be fair,  being dyslexic meant my grasp of English wasn’t the best. 
I made myself read as much as possible to overcome my issues, which has given me such a love for language in general.
I’m so, so happy you’re so committed. You put the work in, you get the rewards!
Good luck on the oral interview, you’ll have to post to let us know how it goes!"
Anxiety,fo838u4,t3_g66te9,1587589122.0,"Hey friend, I know how it feels to be lonely, I guess most of us do. If you need to chat, anytime, just message me on here. 
Heck, we could always Skype or something. I’m married yes, but having a significant other doesn’t stop the feelings of being lonely, that’s mental health for you.  Anyway, me and my husband are always around for a friendly chat."

Anxiety,fo0j5b7,t3_g4rlji,1587414075.0,"Completely. It feels to me like a blanket of this feeling coming over, and I just feel so tired and wobbly. If I’m able, resting and doing something to distract me helps. Though sometimes, the panicky feeling of worriedness means I just can’t do anything...in that instance, time Is the only thing that helps, time and for sometimes, eating apples (I’m a unique one I know!)"

Anxiety,fnvzomc,t3_g3q6ga,1587308414.0,"Like others, when I got out. Very annoying most of the time"
london,fnv77gz,t3_g3x2iy,1587282619.0,"Agreed. Went to my in laws yesterday, and while walking, the blossom was floating down all around us. Beautiful

Edit: Can I just say, I went to my in-laws who are in their 80s, to deliver some food shopping as they are unable to do it themselves at the moment due to their individual health issues. I forgot to justify why I went to see them."

Best advice is breath through it and maybe distract yourself - watch tv, read or browse the interwebs. I’m not an expert by all means though...if you need to chat, you can always message me."
