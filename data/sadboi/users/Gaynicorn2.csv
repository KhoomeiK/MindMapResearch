I think it would be good if you did contact her clients on her behalf (as long as you are just informing them she is unavailable without including any specifics of course). If you are both always very open with one another, I‚Äôm pretty positive she will greatly appreciate it when she gets out. 

Also I‚Äôm not sure if you know but there is a subreddit for people with bipolar partners. I believe it is  r/bipolarSOs

bipolar2,fnn9582,t3_g2r95q,1587087137.0,"I‚Äôm diagnosed with bipolar 1 and adhd. For the longest time, I thought my bipolar diagnose was type 2 (which is why I‚Äôm on this sub) but it‚Äôs actually type 1. 

Anyways. It was hard to tell if my inability to pay attention was due to being depressed or hypomanic (depending on which I was). But once I was stable for over 8 months, I realized I really wasn‚Äôt able to pay attention. 

It was a hard call for my psychiatrist to make because she was worried that it was my bipolar making it difficult to focus. But after a few sessions of talking, she did prescribe adhd meds. 

It‚Äôs hard to say how much my bipolar influences my adhd and visa versa. I know that when I‚Äôm depressed and I am not treating my adhd, it makes the depression worse because not only do I lack the energy or desire to do anything (depression), I‚Äôm also unable to do anything even if I want to (adhd). And on the opposite end, when I‚Äôm manic, it is a challenge to focus on one specific task because I have so many ideas. So when I am not treating my adhd, it becomes even worse. 

Not sure if that helps at all. But know that it is more common to have both than you think. And if you ever need to chat, message me."

Deep cleaning your home is another great thing to pass the time. 

Another big thing for me has been talking to people I don‚Äôt usually talk to much these days. I‚Äôve been in contact with my parents every day, reaching out to friends whom I haven‚Äôt spoken to in a long time, and having daily video chats with the people I typically see on an everyday basis.

I receive 1.5x for exams, always in a private room.

I also have notes sent to me by another student, so long as a classmate volunteers to send their notes. 

It made the world of difference to get accommodations. First time I became registered was after my first proper manic episode and subsequent hospitalization.
