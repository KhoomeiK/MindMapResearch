ptsd,forruh4,t1_forljgv,1588017411.0,That’s exactly how I felt. I still struggle with that and kinda dance around my root causes too. Cbt honestly isn’t bad. I think that cbt will be worth it though. Sometimes you just have to face those things. Usually when I get overwhelmed we stop for a bit and I get to calm down. I wouldn’t stress too much.
ptsd,for9e94,t3_g94e40,1588008406.0,CBT can be intense sometimes but it’s not that bad. The only thing is I end up feeling bad after the sessions because it brought up everything that I have to deal with. After the sessions I needed to be easy on myself and just relax. I also need to be prepared to actually put the work in and face everything. I wouldn’t agree too much about CBT. Its helpful.
ptsd,fopjap3,t3_g8qwsx,1587962979.0,I dream about things that happen in the future. It’s kinda weird because I don’t believe in that stuff either. The name for this is deja reve. I would suggest looking into it.
