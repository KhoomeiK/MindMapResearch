depression,ff5hutd,t3_errcts,1579593566.0,"People almost always keep goals in mind, and with those goals they form their lives. While it’s true that some people are too involved with their own goals to notice someone else’s, so too do goals intertwine. You can’t simplify the entirety of life down to a simple thing, because it isn’t. Life is what you make it. Those who don’t see you aren’t bad people, they just worry about personal issues such as feeding their families, keeping themselves alive and many other things. Seeing the entirety of the world as uncaring is wrong. While it can be said that a vast majority is too involved with itself, there is the part that focuses on helping others. There are people whose sole job is to help others grow. There are people who care for one another. There are people that know how the world is. Ignoring each and every good thing that people do for each other is just as narrow minded as you say the world is. The world is fucked in many different ways, but ignoring the good won’t do you any better. Joining those with dreams and aspirations is easy, you just need a goal that people can accept. But unless you decide to join the world, including the good and the bad, only the latter will be there."

Feeling like a burden means you don’t want to force yourself onto others, but if someone invites you to go out by chance then you wouldn’t feel that way. Friendship is something that takes time. Start spending more time with those who enjoy your company and by the end up the year everyone will want to hang out. If being a burden is what bothers you most then talk to people about that and stick with those who understand."

When you surround yourself with so much as a handful of people you’ll feel happier."
depression,fbq2ric,t1_fbppcc0,1577027730.0,"There isn’t a way to get an idea of what she’s thinking unless you can get inside her head. You can’t hear something from someone and think it applies to everyone. Every situation is different because people themselves are complicated. Depression is a pretty complex thing to understand but at the same time it isn’t. It’s confusing and contradicting, but that’s just the way I see it. I hate when people talk about depression as a disease and try to make it look like there’s something wrong with it. I see it as a chemical imbalance that I have to learn to deal with, not a cancer that has to be cut out. If one grows and learns to deal with the depression they grow as a person. But that certainly isn’t how other people see it. As for my comments, I certainly don’t want to say something untrue or something that will worsen the situation, but at the same time I can’t give a solution or say it gets better. There are so many variables to life that I can’t give one specific solution. 

In other words, you can’t know how one person thinks without hearing it directly with them. It’s a hard thing to talk about. The only way you’ll get anything relevant is by hearing it from her directly, but if she doesn’t talk about it you’ll have to live without knowing. It’s better than bringing in false information."
depression,fbot6kf,t1_fboidez,1577014087.0,"When it comes to those problems there isn’t much you can do but voice yourself. I myself don’t like talking about it to much, and most of the people I know are okay with that. Depression is something hard to deal with and it affects everyone differently. If she doesn’t want to talk about it then let her slowly open up. Most people would get bothered if someone insisted on something they don’t want to do. I don’t doubt it’s hard to be on the receiving end, but try to not worry."
depression,fbo7kcg,t3_ee35ae,1577007600.0,"Many people deal with the same thing because of disregard and ignorance from people who don’t know better. There isn’t anything you can do about people not knowing except cling to those who do. There’s people who do care (as shown by everyone here) and they know what it’s like. Ignoring family isn’t easy, but try avoiding the situation as best as possible. Talk about your feelings with those who understand and show concern. You’ll get nowhere by talking to people who don’t care enough for a quick google to help someone out, so form a close group with people who show an interest and understand and support you."

Not a single person is the same as another, depressed or not, so if you want the most accurate results the best idea would be to talk to her directly. Everyone is affected by depression in a different way and to different degrees, and many different factors can alter this as well. There are the basic outlines that make up an overall explanation, but only people with direct insight can really know what’s best."
depression,fbo4k6j,t3_ee30aa,1577006755.0,"Some people don’t understand depression and anxiety and so many other mental disorders, but there’s nothing you can do about that. It’s hard dealing with built up stress and it only grows the longer you don’t take care of it. There are so many things you have to take care of in life and it certainly doesn’t get easier. When it comes to problems and being repeatedly hurt by all of them the only way you’ll get it to stop is by picking yourself up and taking them on one at a time. Mental issues are the hardest thing to take care of. They take time and dedication to be made that much bearable.

That change isn’t always immediate and sometimes you may feel it’s minimal, but if you show people that you care and want to do better they won’t stop loving you. There isn’t one set solution for anything, but many different things can help. I can’t really suggest anything as it’s always a different case with these kinds of things, but do try to find what you think is best; but if you can’t, then look for outside opinions."

But if quantity is still something you’d like then you can always go to extended family and make new friends along with friends of friends. But do try spending quality time with one or another person if you can. You’ll feel better making one person’s day than staying at a party with many other people."

I do think some people need breaks at times, but that doesn’t mean the love is gone. I don’t know whether I should talk about the future because I know of nothing when it comes to that. Being understanding is the least you can do. If you think she will leave or she already did, then take everything you can from the experience. Having close people always helps if you end up losing one or another. But if she doesn’t leave and you’re back together after the short break then work on being understanding. Tell her how you feel about it and ask her how she feels. Understanding and communications are the most important things in a relationship."

But building a schedule and organizing yourself helps. When you’re feeling better try to find something to strive for. Something you have the determination to do. It always begins with small things though. Work your way up to something that you want, but don’t take shortcuts. Start with getting up from bed, and then taking a stroll every so often, and then work onto studying, and more and more. It may seem long and tedious, but in the end it’s worth it."

But then again, there’s moments of peace and happiness everywhere. We live to appreciate those moments, whatever form they may take. But at the same time there’s two choices to make. We either let the world go to shit, or we put in more effort than the world is putting to end us. Yes, life is terrible and cruel and the absolute worst; but those few moments that bring you joy and happiness make it that much better. All of us have the power to change the world and help it, even if it’s one person at a time. Certainly there’s some of us doing worse than others, but we still have the choice to go against everything and keep on living. Words like these really are pointless in a matter of life and death, but it’s for those who are on the road to that decision.

You’ll find something to invest in, hopefully someone trustworthy, but in the meantime you have to get back up and dust yourself off. When we’re hurting we look for ways to let it out the fastest way possible, this isn’t always bad, but try releasing that stress in a good way, whether it’s crying or punching a pillow, just focus on yourself and yourself only right now. Try sleeping if that works. If anything set up a schedule. Organize yourself and make up something to look forward to, no matter how trivial.

It’s hard to trust anyone after going through that, but it’s good to reach out to those who you do. Being with people who really do care for you helps, whether it’s friends or family. One thing that’s unhealthy is to look for a new partner for the sake of feeling better, that normally worsens the situation. But do try to invest in a new relationship. Take things slow and find someone trustworthy and stick with them. If there’s no one you trust enough then it isn’t a bad idea to meet new people. You have the power to change this situation. Look back at your past and improve on what you can, whether that is finding someone trustworthy or not rushing things.

Doing things for others or someone close can really help. One way to look at yourself is seeing where you began to where you are, not the other way around. When you find something that you enjoy, whatever it is, it will be ten times more satisfying than anything else. Keep looking for something to invest in, whether it’s trivial or popular.

You’re a kind soul, I can tell; from considering quitting your job to not be a burden, to feeling bad for ranting to your friends; so put that to good use. Offer help for others in every way you can. When you see yourself as worthless doing things for others out of selflessness can help.
