BPD,f5ujiu3,t3_dp5p0v,1572474655.0,"I came across this post at such a perfect time. I've recently just started getting my life together again and I'm finally where I wanted to be for years but now that I'm here I'm constantly scared of messing it up by doing something stupid. It's so bad to the point where I never allow myself to have any fun and even when I do I'll feel guilty and feel like I dont deserve it and feel miserable during social gatherings. I honestly dont want to be a part of any social gatherings anymore but I fear that by not going out, I'll lose all the friends I have and miss out on life. I have a big party coming up tomorrow and I honestly dont want to go but if I dont go what if I never get a chance to hang out with these people? What if they get really mad at me? The guilt and fear is eating me alive"

leaves,f1n0c46,t1_f1n02n0,1569606092.0,"One of the main reasons it took me so long to quit was all the people around me telling me weed has no adverse effects and that if it ""helps"" me then it's okay to have it every single day. I even saw a therapist and other counsellors about this issue and that's exactly what they told me. I knew about the small chance of developing schizophrenic but that was about it"
leaves,f1mzphg,t3_da0am7,1569605696.0,I've been getting severe stomach cramps and my appetite has been all over the place. I even fainted 2 weeks ago but I wasnt aware of CHS symptoms then. I decided to quit cold Turkey 2 days ago for personal reasons but this is completely new information. Someone also mentioned that there were fatalities due to this? That's insane. More people need to know about it.

I always assumed that ""smart"" female leaders dont become potheads so I always put myself down and told myself I couldnt do it hut hearing your story really inspired me. Good luck with all your work and your master's degree. So so so proud of you!!!"
leaves,f1mwnz5,t3_da23qo,1569603778.0,"I can totally relate to what you're going through because I went through the same thing myself. For me, the main thing that pushed me away from weed was noticing how bad my performance had become in school. That was the wake up call for me and after that i came clean to everyone in my life about having this addiction and cut out all my friends or anything in my life which made me want to smoke. Just try to change your environment and keep a list of reason why you want to quit. Maybe even hang up some motivational posters on your room? Another thing that helped me was quitting cold Turkey instead of tapering off but it also depends on the person. Have you tried cold Turkey so far or tapering off? What do you think is making it harder for you to quit? Let me know how things go for you."

I also think that at this point you should seriously make that appointment with your doctor or I'm afraid you may relapse.

leaves,f1izlkl,t3_d9illg,1569516822.0,"I know exactly what you're going through because I was a daily/hourly smoker since I turned 18 as well. Most people who smoke like this, myself included, are people who are trying to numb themselves for a reason. I'm sure you were just trying to run from your emotions and the events in your life were too overwhelming at some point which lead you to be here. Be kinder to yourself, you are the only one who knows your story and all the pain you've faced in your life. The fact that you're even alive today is a miracle and I'm proud of you. The fact that you can even admit that you have a problem and you want to better yourself not just for you but for the world as well, says a lot about you. Please dont ever think of hurting yourself. You are kind and you are brave and people like you are needed in a cold world like this."

It used to be a huge problem for me when I was smoking 24/7 but now I've cut it down to twice a day so it iant as hard. I've been throught he exact same thing as you and the only thing that helped me from buying another ounce is keeping all my money with my mom. You can try keeping your money with a trusted friend and just keep enough for actual necessities. Another thing that's helped me a lot is going to the gym and playing video games."

leaves,f1iuqy0,t3_d9lbzi,1569515173.0,I had a boyfriend similar to your wife and to be honest he only made my addiction worse. If she truly cares for you then tell her to quit with you at least for 3 months. Itll be impossible to quit while being around a daily smoker who you used to smoke with.
