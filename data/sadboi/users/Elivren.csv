I preface with this as given the right conditions in a very relaxed state of mind, I can experience ASMR without watching or listening to a video.
..I guess I attach parts of the video to a memory of the feeling.. I learned how to 'hold on' to those feelings at a young age.

One the other hand, watching too much ASMR does reduce the effect of the videos, so to mitigate this I vary the particular videos I prefer to watch and go for quality not quantity with the frequency."
