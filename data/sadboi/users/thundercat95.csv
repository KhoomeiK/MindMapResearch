depression,fp6rjqr,t3_gb8bjf,1588357365.0,"Apparently people who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and survived had a similar feeling of immediate regret when they had jumped. The second they couldn’t change their mind that feeling of I want to live kicks in. That’s why so many people who attempt suicide end up living long lives. Lot of suicidal people don’t get a chance at that feeling of regret depending on the methods.

That’s what popped on my mind reading your story. For you that news about your cancer was similar to that oh crap feeling they must have felt. I don’t have much experience with cancer I won’t pretend I relate to that experience. I’d say with whatever time you have left to just do anything that makes you want to experience another day. There’s a certain freedom in knowing when your time may end I bet.
