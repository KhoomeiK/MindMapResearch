What I did to get rid of them was to just accept them. Yes, they‚Äôre uncomfortable, but it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt agree with you. HOCD won‚Äôt make you gay, it simply tricks your mind. Let the thoughts flow by accepting them and eventually they will reduce in temperature. Hang in there."

HOCD,ezn82nx,t1_ezmxiri,1568002184.0,"You won‚Äôt for awhile. HOCD confuses your mind. Whatever sexuality you say you are, you are."
HOCD,ezmfo4n,t3_d1d6b3,1567991245.0,"Well, let me tell ya ‚Äî you definitely can stop. The fact that you are telling yourself you can‚Äôt says it all. OCD is a mind game; you gotta play your cards right. 

The depression along with OCD is very common. I got it all the time. You will continue to get it as long as you fight it. You need to let the thoughts flow, otherwise they‚Äôll continue to control you. You might think you aren‚Äôt strong enough, but you are able to control them.

I‚Äôll put what you‚Äôre feeling into a different light: If the anxiety comes along with the depression (both will fluctuate; might have one, the other, or both at the same time) then the feelings aren‚Äôt true to who you are. They‚Äôre definitely real, as all thoughts are ‚Äî telling you that they are fake will only make it worse. However, given that the depressive and anxious symptoms come along with the thoughts, not to mention the compulsions, you‚Äôll need to understand that whatever sexuality you say you are, you are. No thoughts or actions will say that UNLESS the input is who you actually are. If you were actually attracted to the same sex, which there are many people that are the same sex that I‚Äôd consider attractive, doesn‚Äôt mean that you want to be with them. Observation > True Attraction

Remember that OCD can fuck with your head and make you do crazy shit that seems otherworldly to you ‚Äî recognizing that they‚Äôre only thoughts is the first step. Hang in there and message me if you need anything."

Come to terms with the fact that even though you aren‚Äôt sexually attracted to women, you can still recognize that they are attractive. Same thing for guys (although you are sexually attracted to men whereas I am sexually attracted to women); I pass by guys all the time.
