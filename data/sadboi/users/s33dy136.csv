They will assess you and refer you to the psychiatrist/psychologist or both whichever is more appropriate. The same process applies for seeking help at polyclinics. If you find that the UCS waiting is excessively long (1.5months baaed on what the pthers say), please go to a polyclinic the waiting time might be shorter. You can also go to CHAT at scape to get a free diagnosis and referral. 

Hope this helps :)"

Might be a good idea to focus on your (mental) health during hols (while studying ocassionally) especially if you are feeling pretty stressed out already since it will only get worse from there leading up to As. After all, it is a holiday, so do tend to those health needs first, especially if you don't have close friends through this journey with you.  I guess find someone u can clear your doubts with"

Your title is a nice goal to work towards but it's not exactly good advice.

Your *unsolicited* advice leaves me feeling uncomfortable, and is doing more harm than good. It's like saying asking someone why they are depressed and then telling them not to feel depress. Just because you say/advise something, doesn't make the feelings/issues go away. By posting such post that blankets everyone, you are simply enforcing the existing social discrimination against mental health. Please be more sensitive about it, and read up more about it."

intj,eoedmzr,t1_eodnnab,1558493867.0,">it can be a good idea to eliminate as much sensory and tangible work-product from your paid work as possible, as a way of biasing your work toward natural INTJ gifts. Mental models, contingency planning, standards, broad-minded, intuitive things like that where the sensory impact on you is pretty low

I did consider these factors, which is what had me interested in Industrial and Systems Engineering. The modules offered at the only school which had ISE in the area were a pretty equal mix of social sciences and statistics so to me it felt like this thing where you basically use statistics to justify your intuition and stuff, kinda like the least hardcore stuff. Sadly my mental health was pretty bad during my exam period so I couldn't score well enough for it :/

&#x200B;

>Doing highly sensory math, troubleshooting, and sensory technology development

I like troubleshooting to some extent because it's largely where there's a lot of potential for action to be taken, especially when one considers the fact that there are already existing ""solutions"" to a problem but most of the time they are really one-sided/blind to the other factors. It would be much more effective and efficient to manipulate the existing systems to put those mental models/ contingency plans/standards in place lol ;)

I might be wrong about what ISE is tho :/

&#x200B;

The thing about MSE for me is that the school that offered is actually research-intensive and the biggest MSE faculty. The school only offers a minor in systems management. The school which offered CE is more IT-based and is the only school with ISE as a major. I'm also considering if I should appeal to this school's MSE department. I might be overthinking this as my therapist suggested but I cannot decide if that minuscule chance to double major in systems engineering or double degree in ISE is worth the leap. If I took MSE for my bachelor's, there's still a chance to take a masters in ISE. Am I harping too much? Does anyone have problems with such a strong fixation on something? How does one overcome that?"
