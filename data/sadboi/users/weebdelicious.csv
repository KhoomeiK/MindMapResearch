AskReddit,f4gep15,t3_dkjju6,1571580343.0,"So I was 6 months pregnant doing website support and we had just and a major update to the site and lets just say it was not going well from the customer end. Everyday, all day people would call in SCREAMING  how they hated it and all the usually shit people say. We also got calls from our employees that helps the customer in the field angry about the update too. Employees were instructed to submit feedback when they ran into issue with the update or when they had suggestions they wanted to make. 

This one employee called in and I’ve got the angry preggers going on something fierce on a Friday, 10 minutes before 5pm and I’m supposed to be going on a little vacation with my spouse for 2 weeks. They call in screaming about how terrible this is, their customer aren’t happy, why am I not doing anything about it, bla bla bla. I snapped and said in my complete ‘un-customer Service Voice’, and full momotoned and additive filled“ if you don’t like it, use the feedback form!”. Now I sat next to my department trainer and my team lead and I am that person who is 100% happy all the time and never break customer service mode but that day I heard them stop clicking on their keyboard and gasp. The person on the phone of course was caught off guard and said “what?” And nervously/angrily laughed back ( I’m not sure what emotions they were feeling) and me still pregnant angry repeated my self but slower for some reason” if. You. Don’t. Like. It. Use the feedback form. Or send and email to ______________ and i can submit it for you”.

Both my trainer and team lead are dying of laughter and shock at what’s going on and my new boss had just heard me repeat myself and was listening in to the call is also laughing. That was my last call of the day and let me tell you! The email they sent was just as angry as the call and somehow I got that email to work and replied back with a prewritten prompt telling them that they could submit the feedback them selves."

My friend was going to take me to pick out a vape since I used to vape a while back and was in need of a new one. We couldn’t find parking and just drove around and started talking about life and somehow got into a tangent about our childhoods and things we went through and one thing led to another and I told them how I had serous thoughts of killing myself multiple times this year, how I had almost done it a few times and how I had told my spouse but felt like they didn’t really understand it all. 

It was emotional for both my friend and I and they surprised me with telling me that they didn’t want me to feel that way and we’re sad that I didn’t come to them sooner about it. I had never opened up to any friends like that before. I didn’t know what to expect at all but they comforted me I really needed, they cried with me and even gave me the number and address to a councilor that would listen to me if I ever felt like I did before ever again. 

Trust me when I say I was 100% terrified when I told them.  I was imagining the worst. And I got something better out of it. It’s going to be scary because you will be telling yourself that they aren’t going to understand but they will. If they are a close friend like you think they are, they will be There for you."

Our department was only 15 people so with 4 having to go maternity leave back to back and only 2 of us returning from leave it was ALOT to deal with for everyone. Thankfully my boss who was new to us and our team handled it extremely well. She made sure we all were mentally and physically ok, didn’t stop us from taking time off when we needed it, if we didn’t have courage she would encourage overtime or make up hours. If you needed to work from home because of something, that’s fine do it.

I know they would eventually get over it but the thought of doing that to them stops me from going any further then a depression spell. I have a 1 year old and the idea of leaving her to live her life with out a mother kills me inside and I wouldn’t want to leave someone so precious behind like that. I’ve had to uproot myself to a completely different country, give up my job and stay at home so that I could stay with my family, which is my one thing that keeps me bouncing back. But the fact that I did that pushes me down so deep! Then I tell my self “ you get to go to a completely new place, see things you only fantasized about and do it with your family and live here? Freggin awesome!!!:)”

There are days where it does get hard and the whole world smashes down on me or something makes me feel like nothing is worth it. Sometimes it’s the very fact that I have all those people to think about it that I’m a parent and I have to give my whole being for someone else. It does all push me into this horrible box to where I think “ I could make it all stop if I just wasn’t here!” And then, I’ll get a phone call/face time from family or my daughter with say or do something that just makes it all go away. Other times those things will bring my down farther and it makes it harder to get back up. the fact that I’m a stay at home parent, in a place that’s completely foreign to me, and I have to depend on someone else to live off of destroys my spirit some days. Then I think about it another way like “ I get to sleep in, not get verbal harassed for other people benefit and watch anime with my kid all day? Yes!!!!” 

All you can do is look at what you have even if it doesn’t look like it’s worth it or even if it’s what is being you down at the time, just think to yourself “ I felt happy before this, I can do that again. I just need a minute or two to get back up there.” Or turn the perspective around somehow.
