depression,fmejboa,t3_fuqtmi,1586005732.0,"Yes, I felt the same way for the longest time. And yes, when I voiced it out, people disappoint me more by telling me, "" If you're living that way or are offended by so many things, you can't make it in life"". That's what my father told me when I was 11/12, and those words stuck till today. It seems that people who close their eyes to the cruelty of the world or those who decide to ride on those cruelty for their own benefit/ ignorant people who don't care are the people who live life without feeling slightly upset about the way it works. 

I am still very much depressed even till this day. I tend to think of this world as temporary. Let the evil rule, because I lack the power or the ability to stop that. Let the two-faced people thrive. Let the world spin around this axis of all the negative values we were thought not to do. Corruption, murder, lies, misuse of power. Because I am a hopeless mere mortal. It is not up to me to change this whole world into an idealistic one.

Am I unhappy? Yes. But I am too tired to care nowadays since no one appreciates it when you are trying so hard to make the wrong right. Everything is just relative. There is no right and wrong and we are just cells with an expiry date."

If I was brought up in a more chill and loving and easy going family, I wouldn't react so aggressively/negatively to certain things. Which sucks. And I am very aware why I act a certain way to certain things which might not result in the most favourable circumstances for me."
