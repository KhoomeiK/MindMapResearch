culturalstudies,fqqiown,t1_fqprqku,1589566201.0,"Here’s the thing though. Religiosity is actually counterproductive to staying married. Here’s why. Overall, religious couples marry younger. They get less education and start having kids earlier. Therefore there is more financial burden given that most likely both parents only have HS diplomas. Financial struggle leads to marriage problems, marriage problems lead to cheating or marital strife. Younger couples don’t have the time or maturity to develop healthy relationship and communication skills before the stressors start. Then divorce. (Source: masters

Soap,fq11yeq,t1_fq10tc4,1589040681.0,Yeah. I meant is there a brand. I’m thinking of Lush. They use ingredients in their stuff that could go bad. But if it’s a solid bar of soap it will just get better with age.

mentalhealth,foeohty,t3_g72fqb,1587709540.0,He at least needs therapy. Do you know if it’s just ideation or does he know how he would do it? Does he have the means to do it? Early 20s is when a lot of mental illness starts showing up. This is not a secret to keep. Either get him to get help or tell someone who can get him to a therapist at least to assess the danger
mentalhealth,foenw92,t3_g72tar,1587709019.0,You’re right. Men get the short end of the stick when it comes to mental health. You aren’t taught to be vulnerable and open to others. Here’s what I’ll share as someone living with major depression and anxiety for decades. It’s easy to find a reason not to get help. It’s hard to advocate for yourself and make change. You made the first step in visiting the site. The next step is realizing your happiness and wellness are worth the investment. Mental heath issues aren’t your fault but they are your responsibility. It won’t be easy and it may not be fun at times but it’s worth taking control back.

Siamesecats,fo1kdbx,t3_g532d2,1587435193.0,Absolutely keep her inside. It takes two weeks for a cat to adjust/accept a new place as home. Earn her trust by always being around when food is. Get her used to you being there when she eats. It may take a while but it won’t be long before you get marked as hers and she brushes past you or let’s you touch her. (Former feral foster/socializer) I’ve had the most “feral” cats end up being total sweethearts.
