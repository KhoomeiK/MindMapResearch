I can’t tell left from right unless I think about it very hard. I can’t hear in noisy environments. If I am focused on something I can’t hear another person speak to me, even if they yell.

I also struggle with the concept of time. I lose track of time or I’m not great knowing how long I have to be somewhere so I’m usually too early because I’m worried I’ll be late or I’m late. 

I also have trouble putting my thoughts into words, I feel like my thoughts are more pictures so it’s like I have to translate everything to words and it’s challenging and I can never get out exactly what I am thinking.

I have an exceptionally strong visual memory. I can memorise a page and go back and read that page. I can’t remember something I have been told 5 minutes later though, unless I really make myself but it takes a lot of mental energy.

The hardest thing about weight loss is to keep going even if you are not losing. If you are doing the right thing, you will lose the weight 

I was told the fat cells that were expanded to be massive, fill with ‘water’ while in calorie deficit and one day it gets release and you get a whoosh. I definitely saw that after losing 65kg. There will be weeks where you lose and gain the same 1kg and then suddenly 2kg drops and we go again. 

After losing 15kg she will definitely be at the stage where you are losing fat, some muscle and even bone density as you get lighter and need less. It’s a slow process, you just need to keep going. Shake diets work, it’s just hard to not eat and only drink for such an extended period of time.

If you have any pain radiating down your legs, any pins and needles or numbness, pain waking you up at night, unexplained weight loss or difficult controlling your bladder or bowels please see you doctor urgently.

Otherwise, if sprinting hurts your back, don’t sprint. Find physical activity you can comfortably do and stick with it. Your back is strong and was made to move and bend. Don’t linger too long on pain. Rest if it’s sore, use non opiate pain relief if you need it. Enjoy to move. Mild pain isn’t always bad or a sign something major is wrong.
