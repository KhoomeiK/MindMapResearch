depression,eptxdu7,t3_bvup45,1559499537.0,"I’m able to enjoy my friends company and just be in the moment with them, but I do just get moments in between when I think about how sad I’m gonna be when they leave. 

Sometimes I get depressed looking at them because despite them being my friends I can’t talk to them about my problems and how I feel. We’ve been friends for 2years but I still don’t trust them that much and I hate it. I hate being around people but still feeling lonely."
