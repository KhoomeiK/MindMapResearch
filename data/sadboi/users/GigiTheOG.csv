High school years were decent. Almost 27/4 public transportation, so going to parties (anyone remember Hales Homecomings?) and having easy access to up north was fun. 

As a 20something now, I stay in the house. Those closest to me feel like we’ve done everything chicago has to offer. The drugs are superior than any other state though."

I thought I need to visit a mental hospital, because I catch myself thinking negative thoughts (Bipolar II with anxiety), but these educational/ job opportunities are once in a life time. I just feel very sad and alone."

What happened to “it takes a village to raise kids”? 

To OP: I’m sorry about the interaction with your sister. My cousin has twins as well, I babysat them a couple of years ago when they were infants. I was in my early 20s and two infants crying and doing baby shit drove me crazy. I understand your frustration."

I don’t know your friends, but what I have previously took as anger in my mom was actually frustration because she didn’t know how to help at that moment.

I say all that to say, if you don’t feel comfortable telling the close people in your life, have you tried journaling? Maybe soaking in the tub with bubbles and music. Just little things to take care of yourself. 

I wish you well."

hiphopheads,f3g74nr,t3_dgwlkw,1570908062.0,"I was a solid fan after hearing Under Pressure years ago. Then my like of his music slowly started fading away, especially after that “1-800” song. As someone who deals with those issues daily, the video triggered a huge depressive episode and it just did not sit well with my spirit at all. 

Also, unrelated to his music, I didn’t really understand and empathize with the divorce from his then-wife. 

So, I say all that to say: logic is a no from me. 

My friend’s joke: remember when you used to like logic?
Me: ...please spare me."
