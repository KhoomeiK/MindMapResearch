ankylosingspondylitis,f0kohme,t3_d581r5,1568684055.0,"I also have AS and have had a bulging disk for almost 2 years,  I'm in almost the same situation with the epidural shots after having 4 done they said no more and I had to get surgery,  went to the surgeon and he said he wouldn't  do surgery,  or give me pain meds, or continue  to do the shots so I went and got a third opinion this doctor said to try a few more shots and of they don't work my only options are to do nothing or surgery so he sent me back to the first doctor who said he wouldn't give me any shots in the first place.  It was a vicious frustrating cycle but I don't know what different types of surgeries  there are for bulging disk but the one they were going to do to me was called a ""band aid surgery"" very quick and minimally invasive the incision is so small it can be covered with a band aid hence the name most of the people who get it are in and out on the same day. I assume you're already in physical  therapy but if you aren't definitely  start asap and if you have amu doubt that the physical therapist isn't helping switch offices physical  therapy  is the most important  thing for your disk and the only thing besides the shots that have helped me.  So if you're completely  against surgery I suggest just finding a really good physical therapist and maybe start going to a chiropractor. Best of luck :)"

I was on Effexor for around 6-8 months and It is my most hated medication to this day it made me feel like a depressed zombie just constantly sad, numb, and slow. I had a really bad serotonin syndrome episode on it but that's not really the meds fault although it was terrifying and also discovered a withdrawal symptom I never knew existed called ""brain shivers"" it felt like grabbing an electric fence but only the upper half of your body is being electrocuted. After the Effexor I didn't use any medication for mental health for 2 years until around 5-6 months ago I got prescribed Cymbalta no complaints for it so far, except it gave me an even more horrific serotonin syndrome episode but again not the meds fault. Just wanted to share because my father had the same experience with Effexor that I did and its super not fun but in the end we all react to medications differently you should get a genetics test done my results told me I would've reacted badly to Effexor after I already stopped taking it lol good luck :)"

I tried to get my life together go to school,get a job,have a social life ect. but I realized I was slipping back into my old behavior and needed a change, so dropped out of school and I moved in with my dad who was the only one taking care of my sick grandfather, my dad never being mentally stable or able to be independent and take care of himself obviously needed help and I didn't want him to go through it alone. After I moved in about a month later (right around New years) my pap was admitted to the hospital and was in there about a week before he passed away with my dad,aunt,cousin, and myself to be there with him when he went. After he died everyone was obviously devastated especially my dad because pap was basically his best friend and his father they were extremely close and I was worried about his mental health, so I stayed about 5 more months to take care of my father before moving back up to live with my mom. While it taught me alot trying to take care of someone before you're even an adult is alot for a 17 year old who doesn't know anything about life, but I will always value the time I got to spend with my grandfather and the bond I got to build with my dad. I now have my GED and I'm actually getting my life together things turned out ok."
