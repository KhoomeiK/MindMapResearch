In your prayer make sure to not rush or something, try to just take a deep breath and take your time. Try your best to not think about other chores and such.  As for the side of controlling anger, coincidentally I've had a problem with that as I was quite hot headed when I was young. But I feel like you can get better at managing those bad habits and controlling your anger once you start praying and trying to invest more in the religion, over time you'll just find yourself trying your best to cut down those habits.

Maybe there is some underlying issue which you've yet to tackle thats causing this harm and your decline in imaan. Perhaps reading an english translation about the Quran and such would help you feel more connected, as I find that helps me in better understanding it. Just try your best to pray as much, and try to take your time while you can, as that might help you feel a better connection with Allah (Certainly helped me). InshaAllah you'll be better, just the fact that you feel guilty means that you're on the right path (trust me I lost the sense of guilt for many years at one point, days would come and go). Be sure to ask Allah for guidance, to improve your imaan, to make you a better muslim, as those are things which I ask for as well.

We've all thought that here, and even if that's true or not Allah knows best. But the truth is by blaming ourselves in such a manner, we end up being stuck in the addiction more and more. Trust me we've all seen horrible things and we've all done them, but we shouldn't compare our sins, instead we should reflect upon how we can stop doing them and seek for repentance. I still get hung up on the horrible filth I've consumed and done as well, but I can't change the past, if anything those things will just act as a trigger. The only way for me to move forward is to move forward, sure you should look back in order for repentance, but don't look back and think you are unforgivable. I know it's easier said than done, it's taken me a long time, about a year or so just to reach about 16 days or so. It's not easy and it never will be, but just like everything in this life this is also a test. I've been there too when my imaan was low, I didn't pray at all, I didn't even feel guilty. But sometimes it takes one push, and I think truly think, it took this Ramadan for me to change myself. While my imaan still isn't the best as much as I want, I ask and you should as well, from Allah that he guides you to the right path, that he makes you a better Muslim, that he fixes your imaan. Because PMO and the decline of imaan go hand in hand, one can't be fixed while not fixing the other. These are the last 10 days of ramadan, try to be a good person, a good Muslim, pray, read the Qur'an and ask sincerely for repentance and don't stop, as well i. I hope this helps you in some way brother, don't give up."

MuslimLounge,fqjbbq8,t1_fqezugu,1589407564.0,"> I'm happy to live here tbh, I'd rather live here than in a non Muslim country. Unpopular opinion but my personal opinion is that if Muslims have the opportunity to, then they should stay in Muslim lands, unless they are da'wah people or have whatever other legitimate reason. I know many people who move to the West for no legitimate reason, their financial situation was good in the Muslim countries yet they choose to leave. I get that you're trying to spread the message of Islam, but it's the job of the da'eeyah and many times they just end up corrupting themselves and/or their children.

Maybe that's true but there are other reasons. Some families move to the west for giving their children better education which I feel is one of the major reason most move.

>It's incredibly corrupt no doubt and I'm not even allowed to speak ill of the country. Of course that's not nice. But I don't think KSA is my ultimate enemy or something. 

I can't imagine living in a country who's authority and government I can't question. I can't live in a place where I'm not even allowed to speak ill of the government or they might take action against me. That's a bit scary to me, tbh, like I criticize my country's government all the time and I can't imagine not having the ability to do that out of fear"

As for a car and home, you don't need the latest 2020 BMW model for a car, you just need a car, and most people nowadays are able to get one. As for a home, again it matters, you can live in a townhouse, not necessarily a mansion. Sure some people might not think this way, but I think the majority of sisters think in a similar way."
