I just wanna be held.. I want my FP back.. everything seems so pointless"

BPD,fimo3fp,t1_fime3uj,1582539471.0,"This is so true.. It’s just hard getting started when it doesn’t seem like a choice, but an addiction, but I will try to fight it and try to survive all the lonely nights and hope it will be worth it.. I too wanna be my own person! And I hope the feeling of only feeling complete when I have someone, will disappear"
BPD,fimnwn8,t1_fim4ini,1582539195.0,"I feel this so deeply! i like theatre and acting, and I wanna pursue it, but not as much as love I’m addicted and it comes before everything else.

BPD,fdjht2p,t1_fdho3qg,1578471437.0,"Thank you I took your advice yesterday and opened up to a very close girlfriend who is bipolar and even tho she said she couldn’t relate to the validation thing, probably because, as she said, she has had great parents. It was still so nice to get it out and to get some comfort even tho it was over the phone. 
The thing that I really struggle with are those daydreams from hell... I keep making up scenarios in my head where I change what I said to make him like/ validate me..  or about bumping into him in the presence/ future and what I’d say... 
I think about it all day.. I obsess over it and it’s so sad and I don’t want to..."

I can only obsess over so much...."

BPD,f84brzv,t1_f83pvmg,1574239996.0,"I totally agree with everything, but it’s so hard especially the letting go of addictions and coping mechanisms, for me it’s people and sex, but I’m trying."
BPD,f7xoeab,t3_dxx4ki,1574066808.0,And when you actually do get rejected it’s like you loose your sense of self and your purpose. I hate it.
