I try to get him out and walk him twice a day as well for about 20 minutes each walk. Walks usually tire him out, but once he takes his nap he just winds back up and stops listening and starts bitting and peeing all over. I know it takes time but it seems like my progression with him has just completely reversed."

birthday- glittery and shimmering with an amazing smell. the smell is what you would expect a birthday cake balm to smell but 10x better. also glides onto your likes nicely but adds shimmer to your lips which is really cute. 

these are the two i have tried that you listed. i prefer the mint over birthday just because its clean and simple but smells really nice. i do wear birthday when i go out sometimes though as i feel it gives a nice classy look with the shimmer. both are 10/10."

This is just killing so many people, and putting peoples lives at risk. People swear God made the virus, no, it came from an animal, who then gave it to a person, who then spread it to other people. That‚Äôs it. They are brainwashed to believe that any time something goes wrong that it is just ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs plan‚Äù when in reality, if there were to be a God, he would not let anything bad happen. Is it ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs plan‚Äù when a baby dies from this virus? Is it ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs plan‚Äù when a single mother of 6 dies leaving her young kids alone?

puppy101,fm8oq10,t1_fm8i95x,1585853217.0,"Thats what I‚Äôve read too, I think we expected him to learn way to fast which I know is very unlikely. We started taking him out again a couple minutes after he drinks water, right when he wakes up from naps, and when he starts sniffing. It‚Äôs weird too because he only pees inside when there is more than one person around, so it gets me thinking that maybe he also does it for attention. When there is just one person with him he goes to the door and pees outside, but when there is 2 or 3 people around he goes inside. He is not excited, but it also just might go back to him not being potty trained yet. Thanks for the reply!"

I did not know crating was bad, I thought that was what most people did. Whenever we left the house we would put him in his crate but would take him out when we got home. We would also put him in his crate to sleep in. I thought usually dogs went in crates to sleep or when the family is not home to watch it."
highjump,f08bjqz,t3_d1v3oi,1568478901.0,"Okay, I can guarantee that if you just rotate and arch your back, you will be jumping at least 6‚Äô8. For example, if you watch how people do lay ups in basketball, they drive one knee up, which is what you need to do. You also need to rotate and arch your back. Do a backover on the floor, where you arch your back while on your hands and feet. What you‚Äôre doing is sitting in the air, which is not the correct way to do it. You should be flopping in the air. Look up high jump technique and start practicing. I can 100% guarantee you will be jumping 5-7 inches higher by getting your technique right. I did my first year of high jump last season and at first I would always stay sitting in the air and not actually flop. I learned during season the correct way to do it and I increased my PR 6 inches. Good luck bro

PS: You also need to work on your approach, you aren‚Äôt really doing a J curve and your sort of jogging it, to get some momentum you need to actually run so it‚Äôs like your pushing off something, when you don‚Äôt run as fast you don‚Äôt have that much momentum to push off of"
