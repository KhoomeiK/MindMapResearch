I used to use Suave’s Captivating Curls mousse (ridiculously cheap); I’d split my hair in half and use a quarter size amount per side. It seems like a little but it was very creamy and sticky which I now know is because it has silicone. It worked pretty well though if you don’t mind it!

The Herbal Essence mousse has no silicone so don’t rub it in your hands much or it’ll literally disappear lol. It’s a lot lighter so I use more, less than a baseball’s worth for my whole head and rake it through once I’ve detangled. 

This was a particularly successful day I think because I styled it in a wetter state (squelchy sounding after product). Mousses traumatized me as a kid because my mom would use it on damp hair so it was all a crunchy mess when it dried. Definitely keep a spray bottle handy, especially for summer.
