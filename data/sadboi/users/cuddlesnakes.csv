But absolutely worst was psych ward. I can't count the many incidents of maltreatment, misdiagnosing, being left absolutely alone. And they used physical force, a lot of things that should have been last method if absolutely nothing else worked were first choice. Not legal btw. In five different hospitals. Not a single one did anything helpful. 
 I was underage and absolutely no one believes you when professionals say you're crazy. Can't even visit a dentist or any health care professional anymore without problems, it's the feeling that a doctor has some amount of power over me. Tried to go against the law order that I had to stay in hospital, but no chance.  Law does absolutely nothing to protect or compensate in these cases. 


Law and especially (emergency) medical care and CPS are supposed to be the last instances of help and it's terrible when they just aren't and increase the suffering. 
Everyone will send you to psych ward if you are at your worst and say it's the safest place to be. Except it's like hell for some people."

As long as I decided myself to stay at home it was kind of fine, but having the order to do so is horror. I swore to myself to do absolutely everything to not have my rights taken like that ever again in my life, and now it's not even something I did wrong that put me in this place again.

I think psych ward is the main reason for my cptsd. Before, I was in a bad place with self harm etc, but psych ward made me seriously suicidal. Main reason was they didn't realize I was having less obvious and lesser known signs of trauma and misdiagnosed me. I was underage that time, and there was absolutely nothing I could do or say, nobody gave a shit about my opinion. The worst part for me was being tied down and forcefully medicated many times while/because I was having flashbacks. I was kinda gaslit by the misdiagnose of shizophrenia, I was told I couldn't trust anything I felt or thought, that things I experience aren't real, etc. There were so many small and big incidents that combined to me being absolutely terrified, I would do absolutely anything to never ever set a foot into psych ward again. Haven't had therapy for years because I was way too afraid of psychologists, got one now that I feel relatively safe with, but the experiences in hospital lead to feeling absolutely unsafe with every medical professional, like dentist or whatever. 
Plus, having ptsd, many med professionals always think of treatment for it in hospital and I hate it. They think of it as the ultimately safe space, and for me it's just hell."
CPTSD,fiq4r19,t3_f98g2k,1582635056.0,"Absolutely. Sometimes it calms me to imagine revenge in detail in my head. Sometimes it's just rage about what has happened and that nobody involved faced any consequences for their actions. 
Of course I don't do anything to take revenge, but I learned not to beat myself up for the thoughts as they're just coping mechanisms for me."
CPTSD,ffiyqcl,t3_ettbpi,1579986012.0,"I'm definitely not scaling high on empathy as well, but I don't know if I've always been like that as I remember situations years before trauma happened. 
I kind of manage my way around in situations where empathy would be expected, and use cognitive empathy to think through what's happening and what the other person is going through and what would be an adequate response. 
I did decide that I won't be like my abusers, and as long as I act how I want to, it doesn't matter if I feel something or not, the vast majority people won't even notice and with close people, I do care at least on cognitive level. When I am annoyed by someone complaining about ""minor"" issues, I try to remember that it's not on me to decide what should bother other people and what shouldn't. My triggers seem absolutely minor to someone else. Most people don't expect a huge reaction when they are complaining about every day stuff, so no problem. If someone does have bigger issues, it's okay for me to not feel with them, i can think of solutions or just let them talk when they need nothing else. A lot of times, people don't want an answer, they just want to let it out. When I absolutely don't care at all on a cognitive level when someone has bigger problems, I'm probably not close to that person and someone closer will take care of them. 
For me, it's about the cognitive decision to care and/or not to react negative, and over time I decided that aspect has to be enough to be not like my abusers, as I act well and it's unrealistic to suddenly get a lot more empathy."
CPTSD,ffd3d3t,t1_ffcuchp,1579812618.0,"I don't know about your situation. Depends on what exactly you mean by ""making it up"" and what your definition of real is I think.

For me personally a huge part was that I couldn't stop them from happening, even though it was the only thing I wanted so desperately and no matter how hard I tried.  Plus that my symptoms didn't disappear even after years in a non destructive environment and that I was pretty fine before certain situations happened."
CPTSD,ffcbkoa,t1_ffc9afd,1579795907.0,"
First, why are feelings true? They aren't, but they aren't wrong at the same time. Feelings don't accurately represent what happened, but your reaction. But they are real the moment you feel them, and your brain continues to work with those feelings as something that has happened. Neurons and neurotransmitters exist and to them, the feeling is something like a fact. Feelings also cause neurons to form stronger connections, if you had a strong feeling, positive or negative, simultaneously to a presented fact, you're be much more likely to remember it. 

In my opinion, if you try to move on and it works, you're fine. If it doesn't work, well, at least then you know it's not an overreaction. The severeness is usually determined by the amount and severeness of the symptoms, and how long they exist and how good someone manages to cope with them. So if you have a lot of different symptoms that have a huge negative impact on you for like longer than half a year daily, thats obviously not exactly good. If you want to know the different symptoms, just Google for a list of symptoms"
CPTSD,ffc8rno,t1_ffc51q4,1579794133.0,"Do you have negative effects because of those situations? Did you write a post on this sub because you could relate to other posts on here? Psychology doesn't deal in absolutes because everyone is different and everyone has different mechanisms that lead to different ""outputs"". Even though that is confusing, I think thats one of the reasons why the relevant thing can be the well-being of the patient. If your well-being is not how you'd want it to be for a longer time, you'd might want to fix it. 
If you had a house and there are some things that are broken or don't work, and you don't have the skills to fix those things yourself, you probably would pay someone to fix it for you. If you still feel comfortable in that home and don't really notice the things that aren't working, you might not call someone to take care of that, but if you don't like it, if things don't work that you need every day, you might be better of having someone to take care of it. Someone would be absolutely fine if the stove doesn't work cause they never cook anyways, but if someone does cook a lot and loves doing so, he might feel okay for a week, but after that he would definitely want his stove working again so he could continue doing what he likes. 

I don't think it matters that much in the beginning, even if it would be an overreaction, you would still have the output, the symptoms. And usually there's a reason to why someone does overreact severely. I don't think it is an overreaction, but even if it was, it would still be legit to seek help."
CPTSD,ffc2aum,t3_espisb,1579789756.0,"It can. Violence is violence. And ongoing violence can lead to cptsd. 

I was bullied for some years, and even if I can't say for sure that it would be this bad today if I didn't have different ongoing trauma, I do still have emotional flashbacks and triggers directly connected to the bullying. But I did feel like an imposter for a long time, cause ""it was ""just"" bullying, I haven't been in a war or something"".

CPTSD,ffc158o,t3_esl1y6,1579788889.0,"Absolutely. If a baby cries, I lose my mind. I don't have children on my own, and I never ever want to. 
For me, I get so upset that I instantly become kind of angry and aggressive and I can't focus, it feels like stabbing my head. I tend to leave the situation if possible or try to cover up the screams with loud music, but of course that's possible because they're not my children. 
The worst thing for me is that I feel I can't say anything because it's socially unacceptable that you don't want to be around children as a woman. Like when a girl bought her baby to lectures at university all the time, it was horror. 
I know one situation that caused it, and  different traumatic situations before that adds to it. Plus the whole thing with sudden loud sounds that get me startled, the whole hypervigilance thing."

Thankfully, she accepts that and told me it's understandable and okay and good for me, that I am careful and don't trust that easily anymore. 
But I was told by so many people ""oh, they were medical professionals, they surely had their reasons and it couldn't have been that bad, they studied for years and you didn't"" and that's the worst part for me. Especially cause they were the only people that could have helped me, and didn't. And I can have reasons to do really bad things, they still are really bad things. So many people, even friends, immediately tried to explain and make excuses for them. Fuck you, no! I do study psychology now, and being uneducated and ignorant is no excuse."

CPTSD,f4kga0e,t3_dkvlwy,1571650232.0,"I dissociated as soon as I thought about past situations. So I never managed to have the full EMDR treatment, my therapist used a lighter version for me, where I didn't have to dive as deep into my memories. 
And I really struggled to find positive situations or sentence as an opposite of the bad experiences. Because sometimes, every ""positive"" aspect made me feel terrible or I just didn't remember anything. And sometimes it terrified me not to have a lot of control about what's happening in my brain. Plus, I have type 2 trauma, a few single times wouldn't have been traumatizing, so I felt overwhelmed by all the possible situations to look at and couldn't say which situation was really bad.
But for the most part, that therapist wasn't the right choice for me.

I stopped doing EMDR atm and started ego state therapy with a different therapist. Was a good choice."

Oh well, sounds really hard to deal with like everything for such a long time. Glad to hear that you got help and managed to improve!
I think mine was inconsistent because I didn't know about my triggers and was exposed often, but irregular. 

Thanks for sharing that technique, I'll try it! Having those symptoms stresses me out so much more, so it's like a bad cycle. Usually, I just went to bed and tried not to think of it which is hard when having pain. 

I'll have a talk with my professionals, but I would be more than glad if I don't have to talk to/""trust"" another medical professional. After 8 years of medical maltreatment I'm kinda careful with that."

CPTSD,f0j43hy,t3_d527gm,1568650896.0,"I often had the feeling that there is too much of both sympathy and empathy. Like, that's all people do when they notice your pain. What people don't like in my experience is pity or just someone feeling sorry for you. 
Compassion is what I think is lacking. In psychology  it's defined as ""deep feeling for and understanding of misery or suffering and the concomitant desire to promote it's alleviation"". Whereas empathy and sympathy are understood as lower levels of feeling and wanting to help. 

I don't like sympathy nor emotional empathy. For me, knowing the other person is emotional because of my feelings makes me feel bad because I think I bother them or I get the feeling that I have to deal with their emotions as well as with mine. And if someone feels pity for me or something like that, I absolutely hate it. Like its a kind of humiliation for me. 
Maybe it's because I don't have emotional empathy or sympathy, only cognitive empathy myself, so I don't like it cause I absolutely don't know how it feels and what it does to a person and that makes me insecure."

I am getting professional help, but we didn't manage to figure out what to do in this case yet, as the usual techniques to manage anxiety/flashbacks are corrupted by this. My therapist suggested to tackle it with ego state therapy, but I'm not okay do it atm cause a previous therapist tried it and it went wrong. 
The staying in bed thing isn't that much of a depression part, but rather the only way to not do something ""positive"" and holding back not to do something harmful."
ptsd,ey283j1,t3_ct0fqm,1566729547.0,"Late response, but I can kind of relate. I don't have a physical condition that caused it, but maltreatment and so on in mental hospitals. From that, I got really afraid of every medical stuff where I felt not in control, like going to the dentist, especially when I'm not supposed to move or someone touching me.
For me, the worst thing was, everyone telling me that it couldn't be that bad cause they were medical professionals and they had their reasons to do it. 
Finding a good therapist and telling right from the beginning that I'm scared, being allowed to be scared helped a lot. But can't do this with normal health professionals yet, cause I am afraid they won't understand it.
