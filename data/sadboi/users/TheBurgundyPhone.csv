Advice,fhgskx6,t3_f35v85,1581577410.0,"I think there are a few layers here. If you switch religions, would you resent your partner? Could you have a happy healthy relationship after that? If you know right now that yes, you would resent them, that's not a good space to be in. I would say move on and save yourself the heartache of either losing an identity you want to hang on to or the person you love. 

If you're genuinely open to converting, you don't have to make that decision now.  Explore the relationship first. Is this a relationship that you would switch religions for? You may not know that for a while.

When you know, and I mean know for sure that it has serious potential, then I would say look into conversion seriously. 

You may get a tidbit here or there during your relationship that might tell you that you would really like or hate this religion.. and some things might be a deal breaker for you. 

Also the level of expectation for your involvement might be a factor too. Do they want you to go every single Friday night? Will you be expected to be the lead on family traditions? 

There is a lot you don't know. And at this point, you may not have a sense of what you don't know. 

So I would say that unless you know in your heart that you really don't want to convert, don't worry about it yet. Enjoy all the trappings of a budding new love and see where it goes. :)"

I moved to another country when I was 17 to go to university. Same continent though. And I wasn'tt going to do the 'but you're so young thing...'. I used to get that bullshit too. It's not helpful. I feel your pain. :) 

I'm not sure if we have this in common, but I'll tell you a bit about me. 

I hated school. Like. Really. Fucking. Hated. School. Every time I tried to drop out, my parents would give me verbal hell. And I was truly miserable. I look back and wonder 'why did I do that to myself'? I know the answer now: to make other people happy by fulfilling their expectations. And looking back on it now, I wish I would have dropped out. But only because during my education, I changed so much that my professional goals changed. And the degree I got was no longer relevant to my life. It's useless... Pretty much... I've never used it professionally.

After I figured myself out more, I ended up going to school again, but this time (even though I still hated it), knew it was worth it. And I work in the field I studied this second time.

If I would have dropped out originally, I know that my life would be so very different. But that might be ok. I'm happy now, but whose to say that I wouldn't be happy in my alternate life?

And as I've aged, I've developed an appreciation for my youth and how short life is. 

I think we teach our youth to live in the future: what's next, sick it out because it's 'worth' it, what are your plans, what do you want to be, etc, etc... This mentality does not teach you to live in the present our how to be happy. We leverage our present and our youth for hope that we will be 'successful' in our futures... 

At some point the pain of the present outweighs the hope for the future. Everybody's line is different. I only figured mine out years later. You'll have to figure out yours too at some point. But there is a balance that exists somewhere: a good amount of hope for a reasonable amount of discomfort. And that comes with its own set of sacrifices too... 

I believe your pain. It sounds like you've got a lot of thinking to do. And while you might be too young to make decisions without parental permission,  you still have the power to influence your life.

I don't know the details of what you've got going on, but you are the best expert on yourself. And when you look at the pros and cons of this and other options, only you will be able to say what's worth it to you in the short and long run."

AskDocs,fh1wuwy,t3_f11bwk,1581226682.0,"NAD. I am bipolar. I can only give you advice on what would convince me/get me to consider that I had a problem.

I religiously keep a mood log. If my spouse confronted me with data that I had recorded, I would have to take that into consideration. If I suddenly had stopped recording, ask why. 

If my behaviour when told to me aligned with a list of symptoms and the two corresponded. 

If my spouse contacted my therapist and has a joint sit down with them. 

If my spouse, for the safety of our finances, asked to put a limit on my debit/credit card so I could only spend $x/day. Especially if shown my recent spending habits on paper.

If my partner independently tracked my random behavior/sleep/very obvious symptom and then head a serious discussion with me about it.

If a friend who I don't know well and I had not disclosed my condition to asked me if I were ok because I was acting strangely.

For me, with the single above exception,  it would have to come from my spouse or parents. I would dismiss almost anyone else. And the more people involved, the more hurt, volatile or angry I might be. And that would be counterproductive and potentially trigger me more. It would also have to be sincere, and from a perspective of concern, no anger or frustration. Just either pity or worry. Anger could make me defensive or trigger my manic anger.

Again, this is me. Your partner might be different. And maybe r/bipolar could offer more advice on approaching this too.

Advice,ffvwboa,t1_ffvlnhf,1580275230.0,"Your wife works in job placement? Awesome. What a nice advantage. I've worked in a similar role in the past.

If you were in Canada, I would be able to help find services for you, but I know zip about the US system. :(

Ok. So here's my advice:

Don't do a chronological resume, do a functional resume. While, it won't be as compelling as a chronological, it's easier to fill up and is focused on skills and abilities rather than experience. Employers might think she's hiding something with this format, and she is. The purpose of a resume is to get an interview. It's marketing, and she'll be competing against others. It's an uphill battle regardless of style, and it might or might not lead to interviews. 

My gauge for a resume is statistics: how many do I put out to get an interview over time. If an average hiring cycle (Canadian, metropolitan general business. The cycle your working with will be different) is around 6 - 8 weeks from job posting to hire, then in 8-10 weeks, I'll have my stats. I consider higher than a 10% return rate to be great. But again, change the field to culinary, and 40% return is good. But if you're not getting anything back it could be volume, marketing (resume) or both.

For the resume, I suggest reviewing a bunch of jobs she's remotely interested in with her. Have her literally highlight the skills and knowledge she has that are in the job descriptions. Start building the resume out of those. Don't over think it; mirror their language. And go broad. The job description says 'experience with petty cash'? I bet she's managed the equivalent for her household. The skill doesn't need to have already been used in the workplace to be relevant in the workplace. 

Focus on the three soft skills every employer wants: motivation, reliability and dependability. They come through during a phone screen and when cold calling.

And since her resume is fighting an uphill battle,  I would tap into the hidden job market: cold calling. It's not a computer-based skill, and it could highlight a good phone manner. Find 50 companies in her general interest and geographic area that she can call herself. I suggest encouraging her to call 10/business day. Will they be looking for anyone in the near future? If so, when, who should she connect with? Have her write down all the details including who she spoke with and schedule a call in her calendar for follow up (not with the company, just on her own). Excel works well for this, but it can be done on paper. Aim for the follow up call to be at 3-4 weeks before they said they will need someone. Catch that job before it lands on Kijiji. Repeat with a new list every week. This turns the cold call into a warm call: 

""Hi, may I speak with Stan? 

Hi Stan, I'm ____. I was speaking with Donna a few weeks ago, and she mentioned you might be looking for an x around now. I just wanted to follow up and see if a vacancy became available. I've got some experience in y and z and would be interested in applying if it is...""

Folks will ask her for her resume, and she should be ready to email it. And she SHOULD WARN them that it will suck. Don't surprise someone who just got off the phone with a competent sounding person with a resume that would normally be doomed to the circular file. That's not a good way to start a business relationship, and if they're caught by surprise, they'll likely end it there. 

Lastly, encourage her to do something for herself. Anything that's remotely related to networking or professional development. Take a class at the community college or school district or library or free online (resume builders!). Will she need first aid or something? Maybe she can get her certifications taken care of. Or doing a regular volunteer job (ideally related to the field she wants to be in). It's unlikely that the volunteering itself would lead to employment, but networking and resume building will be helpful, even if the results take a while to see. 

And of course, she should tell everyone she's looking. No shame! No one can say to their boss 'hey, I heard my friend's, friend's kids' friend's mom is looking for a job like this' if she doesn't say something. 

And she might benefit from some professional help too. This isn't easy. And looking for work can be very trying. So motivation can be challenging too. 


I hope this helped and that she finds what she's looking for soon. It's really nice of you both to be assisting her with her search."
Advice,ffvl92i,t1_ffvhue6,1580266762.0,"Ok. Thanks! The fact she lives close to a metropolitan area is very promising for finding opportunities. She might have some character references or there from her community activities... 

I'm sorry, but I'm going to ask some more questions. 

What's she looking for? 

What are her computer skills like? And does she know how to look for work? If she hasn't looked for work in over 25 years, a lot has changed in job applications in 25 years. 

The good news is resumes can be written.  R/resumes might be a good place to get some help with that.

 Searching for work might have a larger learning curve. A lot of folks will revert to their last successful method. Example: faxing their resume everywhere in the phone book or walking in some place and just asking for the hiring manager with a paper resume. That won't get her very far unless she wants to work in food services. 

And frankly, she might need some professional help. Searching for work and interviewing are skills in their own right. She could be perfectly employable but lack the skills and ability to find an opportunity and pass an interview. (My mom certainly couldn't.)

Advice,ffvjrdu,t3_evft6p,1580265759.0,"Well that sucks. No way around it. 

The only thing I can tell you is that I know of only three people from high school who achieved their professional goals from the time. 

This isn't necessarily because life got in the way (accidental pregnancy, family problems, money problems, health issues, etc.), Even though I know that happened for some folks.

It mostly happened because they changed as they got older. They gained experience, and the aspiring doctor discovered they hated pre-med, the aspiring writer decided that they didn't want precious work, the aspiring business student discovered their love of photography. And so their goals shifted. And they are all happier for it. 

I'm in my mid-30s, and I didn't find my career path until a few years ago.
I've had lots of jobs, some really enjoyable, some not. And it took me a while to figure it out. 

I think back on the life I wanted for myself, and I truly believe I would be very unhappy if my high school dreams came true.  And at the time, I didn't even know that my career path existed. Hell.... I don't even live in the same country as I did then, and I certainly didn't consider that in my life projections!

We don't know what we don't know. And you may not even know what job or field of study is going to capture your interests yet. 

If you were going to find this out, I'm glad you found it now. It's much better now than 3-5 years into an education that won't lead you where you thought you were going. 

This does suck. And I can only imagine your mourning the life you thought you would have. It will get easier, and when you're open to it, there will be more possibilities than you can imagine waiting for you to discover them. 

I wish you a wonderful journey."

Do you live in a densely populated area? Or are you rural? 

Does she have hobbies? 

Is she active in any communities? 

Does she have any references? 

Does she have anything else going on that would make it hard for her to find work: live in a tough neighborhood, person of color, disability, etc.?

Advice,ffjt009,t1_ffjpn3s,1580006131.0,"Well that's not very helpful. 

I don't know what to tell you. While it's very unlikely that she's pregnant, it may be hard for you to feel relief until there's certainty by taking a test.

I also want to point out that this is a red flag for you. There are a few possibilities in my mind: 

1: she's not responding to this situation maturely. And if you can't address the consequences of sex, IMO, you shouldn't be having it. Do you want to risk accidental pregnancy with someone who can't take enough responsibility to take a dollar store test? What would happen if she were pregnant? How would she respond? Because this isn't promising, that's for sure. I'm not sure if you're questioning if you're going to have sex with her again, but I would.

2) is there a possibility of her manipulating you? This stuff is super emotional. And while some ladies are just naturally on high alert and have high anxiety around this, not taking a test to relieve the anxiety is a flag that this might be more about your emotions than her actual fear of pregnancy. And if that's the case, it's likely not a healthy relationship. 

3) Like I said, some people are naturally on high alert (I sure fucking was, so I get it), but if that's the case, I would suggest considering additional forms of birth control: add condoms or spermicide,  or help her get an IUD (the good standard, IMO). And having a very clear conversation about being willing to take a pregnancy test and what would happen if it's positive. Firm plans of action and assurances that she will follow through. 

If after that conversation, this happens again, I (personally) would at the very least stop having sex with her."

I've got dermatillomania: I pull my skin off compulsively. It's the cousin to her condition. I agree with the other poster about therapy. And not knowing you're doing the behaviour is very common. 

Ask her if she wants you to help or point it out. If not, you might be accidentally aggravating anxiety which she may be using the behaviour to cope with.

To address the not doing the exercise right, do you think you could book a trainer for one session? They would set you up with a basic routine, but would show you how to do the exercise correctly. That might help with some of the anxiety. But the challenge is, nothing is ever perfect, and practice is key to improvement. So it might still be a catch 22.

Alternately, do you have someone to go with you the first few times? Someone you trust. I'm thinking moral support. Or an introductory class you can attend? This is where you can see most people doing it wrong half the time. So you'll blend in.

And lastly, there are things that don't require any form or a gym. Walking, for instance. 

My mantra has been 'something is better than nothing, and late is better than never.' there's gotta be a way to take a bit of the pressure off...

I have two pieces of advice: my first is to go slow. Habits happen over time. Pick one thing you feel confident incorporating into your diet this week. Go for it. Eat fruit three times a day for snacks (example). There you go. 

My second is focus on basics. How do you wash fruit? If you eat meat, how do you measure the internal temperature to make sure it's cooked properly? How do you make sure there isn't cross contamination? YouTube will certainly have instructional videos. And you can learn at your own pace.
