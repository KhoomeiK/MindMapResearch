A lot of it was linked to this mirror in our upstairs bathroom.  One night I, for some reason, became convinced that the next person to look into the mirror was to be doomed to hell whenever they died.  The altruistic little fucker I was was not about to let that happen to my family, not even my older sister who I hated.  So I went to go take a peek into the glass.  The second I did, I heard a voice, clear as day whisper, “Now I’ve got you.”  I only told my boyfriend this recently, never another soul.  Now these days I’m not sure that I believe in hell, and if I’m going there I’m sure it’s for a litany of other misdeeds I’ve done throughout the past 32 years.

Which means my heart would’ve just slowly stopped and I’d have gone to sleep, damn how accidentally peaceful.  Glad I freaked out and told her.  The big oopsie was that while the psych unit was waiting for a bed they were supposed to keep taking my vitals, but forgot until I had dangerously low blood pressure.  At that point I was regretting the decision to like, die and ruin my friends and family’s life.  They rushed me bank into the ER and fed me some gelly shit that made me immediately vom profusely and sweat - I assume to restart my literal cold, dead heart, all the whilst apologizing.  Hey guys, if anyone is questioning suicide:  don’t do it.  It hurts so many people, it fucks in your body, and is super embarrassing.  I watched a documentary about people that survived jumping from the golden date bridge and every single one of them regretted it.  Granted, I learned a lot about myself and what I needed to recover, but seriously.  I’m forever the girl that tried to kill herself.  Well, to me anyways.  Since then, I’ve found a lovely man who knows about all that, I have a job I love, I’m still depressed as fuck but I realize life is kind of meaningless anyways, so you might as well try to have fun with it.  Don’t do it.  Don’t look into your dog’s eyes and realize he won’t understand why he’ll never see you again after the scary flashing light people come to take you away.  It’s just a steady supply of guilt and I realized that the biggest problem I had was tormenting my loved ones and dying wasn’t gonna help them at all.  Also, hell is real.  It’s just not what you think it is; it’s a gurney in an overcrowded hallway where you get to think about every way you went wrong.  Please, call someone, reach out if you’re there.
