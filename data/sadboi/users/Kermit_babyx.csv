I became friends with this guy and we had a lot in common and we would vent each other, I thought if him as a real good friend. Then, it got too nice. He was always offering to do things for me, gave me up 50k in onlines games constantly and would do the same for my friend (we‚Äôll call her n) by spending money on her to get her to play an online game with us. He was always too nice and seemed to linger around me and constantly message me. He, for some reason, always tried to coax my two friends (we‚Äôll call them E  and J) into coming with him to a vacant classroom that we had access to (hung out in there often before he became creepy). E and J always found that he was weird. So after him being extremely nice (/creepy) and burning into my soul by staring at me, we all unfriended him. I even dropped hints for him to notice that I wasn‚Äôt interested by being dry. I blocked him.
He was so creepy that I told my friend, N, that she couldn‚Äôt hang out with us because he was so offputting. 
He was also really sleazy.

Tl;dr being way too clingy, it‚Äôs downright uncomfortable and creepy."
