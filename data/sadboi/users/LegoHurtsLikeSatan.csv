Once I left uni, I started my life with my fiancée in a new city with a new job. That job almost killed me, honestly, did almost jumped off a bridge on to a motorway. That's when it got bad.

Started CAT therapy and left my job. Been on disabilities for over a year now and I have to say, I've been the happiest and healthiest I've ever been. I don't have any plans for the future at present and that is okay I think. I do little things that make others happy. I bake, cook and have basically become a full time housewife and I'm okay with that. 

I'm happy where I am at the moment, I have a wonderful wife, two beautiful cats, a roof over my head, food in the cupboards and a few close friends. I am happy and if I'm not happy in the future, I will reevaluate but right now, my therapist and doctor have supported me enormously and I can focus on me."
