plano,fqzcb2g,t3_e1t3lg,1589764373.0,Any updates on this? When is the expected opening?
depression,fpcjnuj,t1_fpcdvkg,1588503044.0,"Honestly talking about it won’t help. I’ve spoken to counselors and therapists in the past and I’ve been depressed for over 10 years. I am determined that this is what I want to do, I just want to know how I can lessen the blow for people."
SuicideWatch,fpan2km,t3_gcb15q,1588451560.0,I feel the same way
SuicideWatch,fpamhc1,t3_gc5dro,1588451209.0,Me too
depression,fjpjopj,t1_fjpjlhu,1583552621.0,It’s really hard. Always hoping when I go to bed I just don’t wake up.
depression,fjpjfmb,t1_fjpj9ss,1583552422.0,Idk I think about it often especially around this time when I don’t really have friends or anyone to socialize with. My natural instinct to survive usually gets in the way.
depression,fjpj66p,t1_fjpj3dh,1583552218.0,Why is it so damn hard
mentalillness,fgv3nl1,t1_fgv2bbc,1581136205.0,Honestly my mom. She would absolutely be devastated
SuicideWatch,feb6gcy,t3_elkfda,1578955821.0,Thank you for providing these resources
depression,facbn7d,t1_facb74y,1575936622.0,Oooh nice. What kind of game is it?
SuicideWatch,facaiip,t3_e85va3,1575936103.0,Yeah I called once and was on hold for 40 min and once connected it basically solved nothing. I know these people aren’t professionals but the guy was basically telling me I was over exaggerating like what???
depression,faca7id,t1_fac9zdt,1575935965.0,I’m sorry to hear that. What game is it if you don’t mind  sharing?
SuicideWatch,f9ucgkb,t1_f9aqnuy,1575648275.0,I mean they basically gave me activities that I could do if those thoughts ran through my head but nothing pivotal. I did counseling for 3 years and o still adamantly feel this way
depression,f9agbdb,t3_dsgdf3,1575202380.0,Yup
SuicideWatch,f9ag788,t1_f9a6h9i,1575202322.0,I’ve done counseling in the past
SuicideWatch,f87tgui,t1_f87sw95,1574342102.0,"I’ve thought staging an “accidental” car crash but likelihood of dying is 50/50. I also thought of self-drowning, but still need to think that one through."
SuicideWatch,f87std7,t1_f87rz0q,1574341684.0,"A lot of people keep saying that but frankly no, this isn’t a call for a help more of just genuinely seeking guidance on the subject. I’ve searched through google but google’s results are pretty censored in the fact that they won’t tell you everything. I found that Reddit is pretty open so I wanted to ask the people. Essentially, I’m looking for details bc if I’m going to do this I want to make sure I do it well, no failed attempts. 

And I’m aware of my resources, and have tried most but nothing has worked so far."
SuicideWatch,f87pgsu,t3_dzi90z,1574339432.0,What did your checklist have? I’m looking to create one as well.
Advice,f86pq7r,t1_f717f6k,1574303946.0,"Thank you, and yes I’ve done counseling, yes I get exercise to help, but at the end of the day I’m just incredibly unsatisfied and it’s not the form of living I want to continue. Also I’m new to reddit and this was the first community that popped up. If you have one in mind that would be better to post this to, I’m open to the suggestion."
Advice,f86pa2k,t1_f728h7k,1574303655.0,I’m sorry to hear the condition your friend is in. I hope you’re doing well!
Advice,f86owkq,t3_du1xky,1574303411.0,"Thanks for everyone’s replies,

Honestly, I know the risk of failure is very high. That’s  why I’m trying to organize a plan to execute this properly. I understand the effects it can have on others and as shitty and selfish as it may sound, I’m at a point where I want to go through with it anyways. However,  only person I care about hurting is my mom, so that’s going to suck. Anyways, I want to get a proper plan and timeline going so I can say my final goodbyes and make my exit. 

Please, if anyone could provide more guidance on this topic I would really appreciate it!"

Advice,f71cg2j,t1_f71beos,1573339088.0,The thing is I have done therapy already and it didn’t really lead anywhere. This has been a decision 10 + years in the making so I have had a lot of time to think over it.
