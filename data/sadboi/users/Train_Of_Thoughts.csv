I used to work in an operations Center of a company in India (not IT) and being a fresh out of college graduate I was so amazed at how people were doing everything as a process. No one had any ideas to improve. I got out of the team and joined the team that we were actually catering to.

A few things I got from my experience :
- Some of it is cultural. It's respecting the hierarchy. When I say cultural, it's organisational culture as well. People just would not want to come with ideas to make other's look bad. 
- lack of initiative is also bound to following of processes. A lot of these outsourced centers are measured on strict KPIs and their goal is just to be in those. They have no incentive to do more.
- Management plays a huge role. Often I found that the mangers were over protective of the deliverables and wouldn't leave scope for creativity."

They track the user demographics such as age, location etc. and as a website owner, all you need to do is just add their plugin to your website to monitise it. This means you get paid via them, not the advertiser directly.

As for the advertiser, they'll reach out to the provider and say, my product is suitable for this range, please show the add. Next is all algorithms which find and target those users.

This is the reason why you might start seeing more of some stuff when you search something or like it. Because the algorithm puts you in the demographic and shows you similar advertisements."
