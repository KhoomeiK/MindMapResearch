breakingmom,fqzimok,t3_glqq4z,1589768174.0,"First of all, I am a big believer in ranting, I’m glad you did it. I also find positivity can honestly be a pain in the ass when you’re down. But I can’t help but point some stuff out to you. 

1. You’ve been dealt a shitty hand, but you’ve managed to secure an apartment for you and a human who completely depends on you who you’ve kept alive for 4 years. That’s awesome! 

2. You threw out an asshole who got physical with you instead of putting up with that shit. 

3. I can’t imagine how hard driving is if you’re blind in one eye. That must be really tough. 

4. Not everyone tests well, in fact tests are BS and really are a shitty way of evaluation. Don’t beat yourself up. See if there are alternative ways to prepare or do it. Have you ever been evaluated for learning disabilities? I have LDs and ADHD, I got extra time to write exams in university because of it. 

5. You are young. I work with unemployed people. I’ve had clients in their 50’s and 60’s lose a job they did their whole life and then they can’t get a job In their field anymore. They have to change careers, go back to school etc. Most people have to change careers a number of times. Your generation is predicted to have numerous career changes in life because of the way the world is now. You still have time. I’m not saying it is easy...it’s not...however it’s possible to go to school. It may take longer. So much is going  online now, which means you can do he work when you want. Maybe a 2 year program will take 6 years in your situation, and that may seem like what’s the point-but when I was pondering going back to school after getting a useless degree, I said how it was going to take two years to complete and it just seems so long and someone said to me “what if you had started two years ago, where would you be now?”, it always stuck with me and I use that a lot when I am counseling my clients. 

6. Not sure what culture your neighbours are. I do my best to respect everyone, but seriously fuck people who don’t talk to you because of cultural differences...not talking to you is their loss. 

Hugs to you💗

Months old and they are still in that getting sick constantly stage.

There was recently an article I saw of a working mom calling SAHMs “the real superheroes” because she is now home during the day and now magically “gets it”. Like seriously lady, being home with your kids for a few weeks means you get it? Like all articles about SAHMs it gave the laundry list of all the things they do, but of course these are all things working moms do as well. When I was at home I said “I am taking care of children all day and that takes up a lot of time”. To be completely honest, as a working mom these laundry list articles praising SAHMs just annoy me because all those things are things I do on top of working full-time and commuting. I was on mat leave for a year and even though I was caring for a toddler and infant twins, I had a lot more time to deal with  that laundry list. I also feel they insinuate working moms don’t do certain things. I’ve seen SAHMs say things that make me think they think working moms all have maids and nanny’s doing everything and it’s like we go to work and forget we have kids and houses to take care of."

Twins,fo4naf7,t1_fo4joje,1587507536.0,"It’s very common for twins to differ in birth weight, especially if they share a placenta as one twin can take more from the placenta than the other, sometimes the more dominant twin can actually kill the other twin. My twins are fraternal Di/Di. Twin A weighed about a pound more than his brother at birth which is pretty significant. Twin B was smaller and much weaker. I met 2 year old twins last summer and thought there was no way they were identical because  one was so much smaller than the other, but they were and the small one was very small at birth and didn’t catch up."

Twins,fo3x80p,t3_g5jd32,1587494479.0,You’re most likely Monochorionic/Diamniotic (Mo/Di) twins. Identical twins can be Monochorionic/ Monoamnionic (Mo/Mo) which are identical twins sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta; Monochorionic/ Diamniotic (Mo/Di) which are identical twins that share the same placenta but have their own amniotic sac or Dichorionic/ Diamnionic which can be identical but more often fraternal where the twins have their own sac and placenta. Sometimes Di/Di twins placentas can fuse together abs they can appear to be Mo/Di because of this. People use to always think Di/Di twins were always fraternal which isn’t the case. With identical twins it’s all about when the egg splits after being fertilized. For fraternal twins it’s two different eggs and two different sperm. Tone sure have a DNA test done.

Here is what it says because the link doesn’t go directly to this part:

“If your employees are directly affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) and they are no longer working, you must issue a Record of Employment (ROE).

When the employee is sick or quarantined, use code D (Illness or injury) as the reason for separation (block 16). Do not add comments.

When the employee is no longer working due to a shortage of work because the business has closed or decreased operations due to coronavirus (COVID-19), use code A (Shortage of work). Do not add comments.

When the employee refuses to come to work but is not sick or quarantined, use code E (Quit) or code N (Leave of absence), as appropriate. Avoid adding comments unless absolutely necessary.”"

Though it’s hard to know 100% in this situation I agree with what one person said. I’m sorry I can’t remember if it’s your mom or hers you live with, but I think grandma needs to step back a little. A clear routine could help as well. It really doesn’t help that she can’t get out and get support with other moms as they can be a big help. I was able to get out and go for walks at places like the mall after having my first, but once I had my twins (and a 2 year old) it was not possible to go out and the monotony really got to me. 

Another thing that helps is exercise...but I know it’s hard to motivate someone to do that, but it helps."

workingmoms,fmpruv3,t3_fwp0o4,1586286194.0,"There is a HUGE difference between being a working mom and a working from home mom. I’ve only been working from home for ...good lord I don’t even know-that’s how messed up it is...a couple of weeks I guess? And i am losing it. My husband is home dealing with the kids, but it’s still beyond difficult. I love them more then anything but going to the office and getting away from them helped me a lot...I was on mat leave over a year (yay Canada) and I ended up with bad PPA/PPD, I went back to work and it made a big difference. I work full-time, and don’t get me wrong it’s very hard, but working from home is very difficult. I’ve been having panic attacks and stuff. I hate it. 

Do they have subsidized daycare where you live and would you qualify for it? Working outside the home may be better for you."
workingmoms,fmpqnl8,t3_fwp4j9,1586285579.0,"Depends on the day. I have 17 month old twins and a 3.5 year old, but my husband is home because he’s laid off (otherwise no way could I work). I have a pretty strong work ethic so I try to put in my 7.5 hours, but really it’s probably 5-6 when it’s all said and done. I’m getting all my talks completed plus some other stuff and tracking things. I don’t work 8:30-4:30, I take a lot of breaks and stretch things out through out the day so on and off sometimes until 9pm."
