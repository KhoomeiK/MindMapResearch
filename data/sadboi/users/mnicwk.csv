depression,fpen3ok,t3_g9ndgw,1588550752.0,"Same, mine was at 12, and i still remember exactly what day what moment i stop living, i was depressed and anxious for about an year then one day all of a sudden when i was lying in bed i felt all those negative feelings were gone, they all gone but so did other feelings. I was like i have to act to be myself, trying hard to remember how should i interact with others, and every time someone talked to me i don't feel they were actually talking to me, i was like another person that stuck in my own body and just hearing them talking to my body through a dull glass, everything is distant and unclear."
