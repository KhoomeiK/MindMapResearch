We are still in almost Muhammad's Era while every other nation we are told to hate is progressing. for example India, Isreal and every other yahood o nasaara nation. but we are being told its test from out God. ok i am agnostic and would keep my mouth shut. 2: yes i met several Israelis and they were fun ppl. I met several Israeli women and despite how much freedom they had, I did like how they loved their culture, religion and were contended with their rule in life. specifically I was surprised that kids were recognized with mother religion and not fathers only. It might be different  for others (? I don't know) but I am genuinely surprised and envious of Jewish women.
3: Israeli passport is one of the good ones so at least they made more friends than enemies in world.
