dating_advice,fbgynjj,t3_ed6llp,1576861586.0,"Honestly I’m a total introvert too and find it really difficult to meet people that want more of a relationship rather than a hookup bc I feel like most introverts would rather do that. My advice would be to go to public places that aren’t necessarily social events to meet people. What I mean by this is to go to a coffee shop, grocery store, park, etc and just practice talking to people even people that you have no romantic interest in. It’s a little nerve racking at first for introverts, but practice is everything and at least it’s easier bc there’s not the added stress of it being loud and crowded. Trust me too, you’re not boring and honestly most introverts would you cute and funny. Hope this helps :)"
amiugly,fbgy5kg,t3_ed0go4,1576861259.0,No joke I have pretty high standards and you would meet them. I know it’s hard to be confident and saying “be confident” won’t help much so I suggest getting help bc a lot of my confidence and insecurity issues were rooted in social anxiety and as that has been treated my confidence has really been on the rise. Good luck with life (:

dating_advice,fa92z9n,t1_fa8z0kr,1575861088.0,It’s actually so nice to here that it’s not just me being oblivious or an idiot and that this is simply a pretty common thing... also I have felt like asking to hang out I’m just so scared of losing one of the few things in my life that currently gets me out of bed which I know is something in and of itself I need to change. Thank you so much for your response it helps to just have a little support!!
