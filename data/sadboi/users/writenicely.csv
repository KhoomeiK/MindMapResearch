And usually I'm considered an intelligent person who does well and at minimum, shows up. 

I understand the anxiety you feel, as well as the disappointment you must be experiencing. Especially as technology, contrary to making things easier, feel like they make things worse. 

All of these feelings are temporary, we don't know when the pandemic will end, but what matters is that you're thriving and surviving as a human being a day at a time.

If you're a hands-on learner, you will need to supplement what you do in class with short activities. Perhaps keep a hard, physical agenda or notebook onhand to record the due dates for assignments. But before anything else, you need coping skills. You need to take care of yourself and relax within the moment before you internalize more anxiety than you need to. You can do it, its only a few more weeks!"

1. Saying things like ""how can these people function in real life which is a lot times more toxic, hard and unfair to people"" cues me in to feeling that you genuinely may have some kind of bias clouding your understanding of what they deal with. Games are experiences that people turn to and play in order to get away from the grind and prejudice they experience in real life.
2. I understand the general frustration with her demeaning voicechat as an inherently abusive tool, but consider this- Its not just a matter of people hitting a mute button, its the fact that the tool opens them to abuse to begin with, and can even be seen as a function that ends up ""outing"" them (a masculine-presenting gamer using their naturally occurring feminine voice becomes an immediate target).

AskReddit,fr15pa4,t3_glr6jd,1589813747.0,"No, I do not want to have serious, long and drawn out discussions about videogames in schools. But hear me out-

I enjoy games, even though I rarely if ever actually played them. I would devour wikipedia entries and youtube videos demonstrating glitches and other phenomena I found interesting in the 2000s before gaming related content on Youtube took off. I enjoyed reading and being able to explore this content, it was similar to a museum experience, and I was privileged just enough to have a computer with internet to do this, even though my family was low-income. Reading about games, being able to enjoy it in peace and solitude was divine, it was like a language I got to decode and learn (even though I know very little about literal programming/coding- I mean in terms of storylines, game plots, settings, witty humor and tropes and themes and easter eggs and what the music sounded like and coming up with fantastic questions I related to videogame creepypasta and being able to envision it all even if I didn't know what the real thing looked like).

Placing that in a sterile environment like school, especially what our current American public education looks like- Its a recipe to kill something that's taken off and really expanded over the years. I'm genuinely trying my best not to come off as an anti-intellectual, but there is a bizarrely alienating aspect to discussing cultural works, even videogames, within class, that are best experianced on your own in unique ways. Especially if there's income disparity and not all of your students can literally afford to be part of the discussion, because you risk alienating the children who haven't played videogames/can't play videogames. And you can't remedy that unless you offer to make videogames homework/classwork. And you do that, and you just make it something else they have to miserably slog through, with limited hours that their peers can continue getting brilliant at because they have access to it at home, while these less well-off children probably only have a smartphone at best, no internet service provider for a laptop. Especially when there's always a caveat with school-provided laptops like invasive webcams.

This would seem like a more appropriate idea for a specific literature-culture elective course in college, where you can just not enroll for the class while everyone else who can afford the course materials and already have a vested interest in it can opt-in. Introducing it at any point prior to college just seems ignorant of families who don't have a gaming pc rig or a bunch of hardcore console classics at home."

I know that Greystillplays doesn't represent all men but he's an example of a male who seems to genuinely enjoy playing as woman characters, possibly because he views their stories as being more entertaining, and more open to relationship based things, or ""more hookers, damnit XD"" \*Yes, sometimes he'll play a simulation game that's in all text with no simulated sex whatsoever, and have his female character do something with her life like become a stripper as soon as humanely possible, and murder multiple husbands, or something\*

I know at least one female bully, and one male bully from my childhood who made me feel like I was lame.

Girls who were nice or friendly to me, did it on a temporary basis, just to be nice, and I appreciated and accepted that. I'm not saying they were mean, but they definately were well-adjusted and normal people who didn't really plan on sticking around me longer than nessacary, or maybe we had nothing in common.

Meanwhile, I had guys approach me. I was already unattractive so to be next to the same few guys actually attempt to integrate me into their groups, meant something. But I was never ""one of the guys"", or one of anyone. I'm not a group person.

Though there was something especially validating about males seeking to be friends with me, seeing that they were neither sexually or romantically interested, and had nothing to gain except for some chitchat about why I was the way I was and how I could do things differently.

Sorry for rambling. I know, I know, I seem narcissistic, but its mostly just being introverted with a side of probable autism and a childhood with no socializing and constant anxiety and being told to focus purely on my grades and blah blah all men are trying to fucking sleep with you so you better not be caught talking to one or else you're a whore. Oh, yeah, I'm Indian, too. So its not like I CHOSE to put myself in danger by taking advantage of the fact that dudes were the only folks willing to try with me.

I've read plenty of books and classic American literature that has tons of stuff thats never pointed out, never explicitly referred to, or can be easily lost on the reader for whatever reason (Especially if you're not particularily informed on religious stories, and are somehow expected to make biblical analogies with East of Eden in your public highschool english class).

How it happened isn't going to matter.

What matters is that Harry Potter is a book with a world that people actually CARE about because they're allowed to envision themselves there at Hogwarts.

I had turned 18 not too long ago and he would listen to me typing. I was writing to an online friend of mine, who actually gave a crap about me, over on google hangouts. He ran in. I immediately closed the tab. JHe came over my side, saw I stopped typing, and I was slapped in the face and had abuse hurled at me. I'm 25 now and To this day I just want someone who cares about me and can repair the damaged person I've become who isn't confident about anything and has suicidal feelings all the time."

unpopularopinion,fpuil6i,t1_fpuhkw4,1588913845.0,"1. She is a rabbit. She doesn't ""catch"" its own food, she nibbles on it. 
2. My rabbit is never caged precisely because I believe in some amount of personal freedom. We have hard limits for her, basically don't gnaw on the damn furniture and wires, no peeing and ripping on the sofa, and thats it. We provide her cardboard and pet and fawn over her as a daily thing. We've bought her toys she legitmately has no interest in/doesn't play with. Emphasis on ""we"" because no one here just dumps all the responsibilities on a single human, we all look out for her as family.
3. If you release a rabbit or other domesticated small animal, its going to die in the wild. No domesticated non-carnivorous animal is going to know how to survive out there, and sadly, rabbits and guinea pigs HAVE died from idiots who do precisely this instead of taking them to a shelter or animal rescue society. 
4. The outdoors in general are very dangerous for buns. We rent an upperstory two family, and its not really necessary to take her outdoors where it may risk her. In fact the local rabbit rescue group makes it a point to say just keep your rabbit indoors at all times.
5. Yes, we want to get her a companion rabbit as soon as we can move to a nicer, bigger home.
6. She was an impulse purchase by my kid sister. I'm the one who had to do a lot of the research and before we knew it, she already became a loving member of the family. I had to suffer a lot to make sure her actual needs were being met and I had to school my ignorant family that didn't believe how serious those needs were. She's 3 years old now. I know her likes and dislikes. She lets me pet her now and begs for it. She binkie'd yesterday in my bedroom. 
7. I spend $260 on her last vet trip and intend to do it again either annually or as soon as the need arises, don't fucking tell me I don't try my best to take care of my baby."

Tell him that if he attempts to kick you out, that even though LI has an unreasonable renter's market, that you can at least find better digs for the amount of money that he's asking for. 

(No, don't say that). Take the advice of the other persons under your post- I'm so sorry to hear that you're dealing with a jerk who has the nerve. You already live in a hostile environment right now. Right now, you can't be evicted until June. Take what time you have to start looking for a new dwelling, right now."
longisland,fpjl80c,t1_fpgkqww,1588672709.0,"I'm going to be incredibly generous, and assume that maybe, she wanted to discuss renting the horse for after-the-quarantine, or something (I don't know about how people plan for horse riding). I mean, its not like she was gonna come over and be all ""hey, can I ride one of your horses right now?"". So, yeah, lets be charitable and pretend for a moment, that maybe she came to ask about something reasonable.

One thing is evident- That she is wealthy/financially secure enough to afford horseback riding lessons, and that she is entitled enough to whine about customer service over social media. These things together, along with specifically naming and shaming the business in question while being vague and nebulous about most of the actual dialogue that occurred, makes us roll our eyes at her privileged non-problem. The insinuation that she was going to attempt at in-person contact for horseback riding making it worse because its something that can be accomplished over a phone call.

I should also mention that right now, stables are suffering and they're struggling to make sure the horses are actually being cared for and looked after. A person showing up at this time is endangering the safety of the animals as well as the people who work with them.

Plus, her language use follows a pattern that just screams entitlement.

Also: When people write social media posts, we can usually understand that they might not be telling the complete story. They may be omitting parts that either hurt how they want to appear, or that they deem irrelevant.

I know that to anyone taking her words literally, one could imagine her getting lost, and being called a bitch/asshole by the manager, who we are to assume wasn't yet informed of her intentions for being on the property. However, this all seems unrealistic.

It is extremely likely that the manager engaged in an actual conversation with her, where she revealed her intention for being there. They, upon disgust, told her to leave. She decides to trash them over Facebook, calling out their use of profanity towards a customer as if to make a point, so she doesn't have to deal with the fact that she was actually in the wrong/ as a petty form of payback for being denied her horse-riding.

Actually, we don't even know what the actual dialogue was, at all. She could have completely fabricated the use of profanity. I don't know, and you don't know. I could be wrong, but she just ticked a lot of boxes for being a Karen otherwise."
