I highly disagree with the characters being one dimensional. We saw how his time at Jangaa distorted Geun Soo's ethics but he had one goal in mind. (better demonstrated in the webtoon.)
So Ah standing up to Jang Dae-hee revealed that She was fighting her own battle this whole time. she had a determination to pull off a plan that took a decade of planning. At first she came of like she was dealing with the shit for no reason.
Saeroyi sees injustice and wants to change that. Less revenge more retribution. 
Geun Won starts out a spoiled, stupid, and lacking of respect for human life. Then he ended out an actual maniac. He is one dimensional in the fact that he is a dick but it's bit deeper than that. Not all dicks are the same. From seeing him and his father's interactions it's clear to me why he is how he is. Seeing his warped sense of reality was entertaining (How him serving time for a crime he committed is equivalent to abandonment.)"

ItaewonClass,fjw30wt,t1_fjulguc,1583633917.0,"I can see it it happening thohgh since So Ah was like ""don't like me"" and Saeroyi was like ""too late"" while Saeroyi was like ""don't like me"" and Yi Seo was like ""don't tell me what to do, bitch"" She is as stubborn as Saeroyi.
Honestly dont ship So Ah and Saeroyi either because she trys to make her decisions Saeroyi's fault. No one else brought the plant but So Ah, she chose to work at Jangaa. The way I see it's like getting mad at the person you stab because you feel remorse for stabbing them. It's okay though because you were hired to stab the guy. May sound like being a unbiased messenger to you Soo Ah but it sounds like being a hit man to me. She had a letter of resignation + some reflecting in the episode in the most recent episode so I'm excited to see how that goes. I've come to understand that I won't understand the any of these characters s ok I just like to see what they do and enjoy the ride.

 I guess part of the reason I don't ship was the beginning when Yi Seo is like ""Life is a pain"" and Saeroyi is like ""Why don't you just die then"" 

So long story short I don't think Saeroyi deserves either of them. He deserves better not to say that he's perfect but he tries. He tries to understand people and takes accountability for his mistakes. Yi Seo is stubborn and does stuff to get what she wants to happen. Can come of as rude and make poor judgement but has a reasoning behind all of her actions. Is also accountable for her mistakes. So Ah is considers peoples feelings just chooses not to listen to them. Looks out for #1 yet doesn't think that her actions that affect other people will affect her (which the do.) She is talented, independent, and stands up for herself yet has emotions dictated by orders she feels she has to follow for some reason. 
After think a lot thinking on this Yi Seo is the better option but Saeroyi does not like her. I guess I like them all separately but don't ship them because 1. He don't like her and 2. Toxic."
