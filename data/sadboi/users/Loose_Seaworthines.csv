SuicideWatch,fqn99ug,t1_fqn3d7u,1589490837.0,That’s kinda true too. It just depends on what you think will be helpful and safe for you. Dropping out is just a suggestion so if you think you’ll spiral then stay with the routine.

I also smile when I see people but sometimes if I’m not in the mood my natural face is a resting bitch face and people still judge me and give me weird looks. 

So yes smiling does help initially but at the end of the day I think it’s pointless to smile because it’s in a way for some people it’s being fake if you’re forcing it. Also it’s hard to like accept this but you really shouldn’t care about what people think. And in the workplace it’s probably different but show your colleagues that you’re still the same person."
