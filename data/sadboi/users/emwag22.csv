panicatthedisco,fq6v934,t3_gh31c4,1589138285.0,"I honestly see every album as a progression of Brendon’s life and change in interest, experiences and musical ventures. It makes so much sense to me that PFTW is a pop / broadway style because that ties into what has been going on in his personal life. Panic! will always have a mix of genres and it’s okay to prefer some albums over others depending on your own style of music, but to call him a ‘sellout’ is so unfair to how honest and himself he’s always been!"
panicatthedisco,fpq6ypm,t1_fpo0n39,1588816414.0,That’s such a wholesome memory to have attached. Your dad has good taste!!!
panicatthedisco,fpq6wud,t1_fppm7bb,1588816383.0,Let’s kill tonight is definitely top ten for me! So many memories attached and I think it’s one of the most Panic! songs out there if you see what I mean
panicatthedisco,fpq6tv2,t1_fpp3bpz,1588816336.0,"Memories is so amazing, that entire album actually I so underrated and for me is up there with first album. Vices and virtues was the album that got me obsessed back when it came out soooo long ago now !"
panicatthedisco,fpq6pc6,t1_fpo2pyr,1588816266.0,"I remember getting the bus to school and blaring this so loud when it came on, boring story too but it holds a place dear to me as well !"
panicatthedisco,fpq6mgy,t1_fpnxynv,1588816221.0,I adore Ryan’s voice I wish we could hear it more ):
panicatthedisco,fpq6k9f,t1_fpnytf3,1588816185.0,I’m so glad high hopes received not only praise from us fans but in the mainstream too because Brendon so deserved it for the past couple of albums he pretty much did by myself !!!
panicatthedisco,fpq6gq0,t1_fpo011i,1588816127.0,Sarah smiles was one of the first songs I remember playing on repeat so I’m with you on that. His relationship is so wholesome it brings me joy!!!
panicatthedisco,fpq6e2c,t1_fpnkrie,1588816085.0,I adore that album and saw them on that tour twice so it will always hold a special place in my heart!!! Where did you see them (-:
panicatthedisco,fpq69uq,t1_fpntsrd,1588816016.0,"Yeah the first album has this whole affect for me to, the truly raw storytelling of a struggling young man still naive to the consequences his poor choices will have. But it’s better if you do 100% captures that good choice !!!!!! 

Golden days is just one that makes me smile so much"

BPD,eyjvsd0,t3_cwytkx,1567129593.0,"I completely relate, sadly. I also often feel like every time I try and express this to someone who has seen me do wrong or been directly affected by my actions / issues they just think I am trying to put the blame on something else rather than 'owning up' to my wrong doings. It's very painful. Has caused recently the breakup with my FP and SO... So frustrating when an illness literally makes you ruin your own fucking life."

AskReddit,ewffhhc,t3_cnqfpj,1565359581.0,"I work at a nursery (for children not plants) so I’ve witnessed a lot of wholesome moments over the past couple of years but one really warms my heart. There is a 3 year old in my class who amongst other things really struggles to socialise with other children and often comes to me for comfort or if she is feeling super shy that day and needs someone to sit at the activities with her. I’ve seen her often watching the other children drawing but becomes too shy to join in herself when the other children start to ask her questions or ask for her pencils etc. So on this day I told her I would help her draw a picture for her mum and baby sister (who she adores and I also look after). She looked sad when she couldn’t draw ‘like Emmie’ (me) and the other children so I said I would draw some and she can colour it in an sign it herself. It look a bit of convincing but she agreed and for once seemed very calm - I use this with her now to take her out of her anxious state. When she has finished I wrote ‘To Mummy and Ella (her sister), Love Chloe and Em (me and the child) and helped her put it in her tray. I forgot all about it as it was just a normal day at the nursery until one day Chloe’s mum picked her up and saw her run to say goodbye to me. As she said my name her mum said ‘Oh so you’re the famous Em! We’ve had your photo framed on our living room wall ever since Chloe showed us!’. I was flattered but asked why that photo was framed and not any others, until she told me that Chloe had never shown her mum any photos from nursery, she had always been too anxious or wanted to bin them and that it was the first bit of artwork they had seen and that she had been drawing everyday at home since! The mum seemed so grateful that I had taken the time to find her child an escape and I can honestly say it was one of the most wholesome, heartwarming things I have ever experienced. I felt like I had truly done my job!"
