I don’t know if I’m too late for this but I am sorry your life has come to this.

I mean no disrespect, but I’d like to challange the logic behind the ‘peace and rest’ narrative that a lot of us wish for. I can relate to it a lot, I just want some relief. Thing is; peace, rest and such require an active concious experience. I can only know that I enjoyed that nap once I wake up, right? Death is (for all we know), not that. It’s, well, nothing. No peace, no rest, no relief, just nothing. 

So if peace is truly what you’re looking for, I’d urge you as much as I can to seek it in life. Maybe you need to find a way to rest and rechaege at the moment, somehow or someway, and then make a focused effort to reach a point where you’re at peace. Might take a lot of back and fourth; I mean really a lot, but in the end, a it’s going to be a concious, real, living relief that you’ll experience."
