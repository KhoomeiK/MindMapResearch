Judaism,flf32cv,t3_fngzct,1585096953.0,You definitely have a connection to Judaism and it’s never too late to get close to God. You have a connection to Christianity too. I’m guessing you feel lead to deepen your spiritual walk. Explore both and see what feels best for you !!!

depression,fi6sipk,t3_f6hi88,1582206268.0,There is hope. I used to just lie on the couch. Feeling sorry for myself and so negative. I have changed thank God ! Get up. Shower. Get your day started. Plan something for the day. Start slow. Things will improve. I’m working. I enjoy my job and put my heart into it. As far as music goes. Piano music. Tons on YouTube I find very relaxing and helpful 🤠
depression,fi0cr6m,t3_f5ps58,1582033677.0,Good therapy to vent. I can relate to what you are saying. I believe everyone has a purpose in life. You have one too.

booksuggestions,fdp5n41,t3_emhhhs,1578620562.0,Welcome back ! Reading is a fantastic way to pick you up. Personally I like detective thrillers. Peter James is excellent if you want to give him a try. Get your favourite beverage and/or snack food and read away. All the best !!!

Agoraphobia,f8v5evk,t3_e2azua,1574860086.0,Totally understand. Stay home. Why don’t you invite your family over for a visit. Like coffee and dessert during the holidays. This way you have spent some time with them but not too much. Helps you keep calm and less negative feedback from family members. What don you think ???
religion,f8agmz2,t3_dzcsd1,1574396742.0,I understand. You want to please God not man. Make a list of things you want to be for God and what you would like to do for God. That’s a good start. When everything is written down in front of you. That will help you decide. Pray God will show you exactly what he wants you to do. BH !!!
religion,f86vm0k,t3_dzcsd1,1574308026.0,"You will never find the perfect religion. I am Jewish. I was brought  up conservative but also have been to orthodox congregations as well. As long as you are following the Torah, customs as you call It, after prayer God will show you how and what he wants you to do to be the Jew he wants you to be, God knows your heart and he will show you how to live the life he wants you too. Hope that makes sense to you. Please feel free to comment,..."
