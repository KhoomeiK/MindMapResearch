Like I said there are definitely battles where she comes in handy, but she's more of a niche and I was rating based on character themselves versus whatever extras like grasta etc."
AnotherEdenGlobal,fnxrzjd,t1_fnvjpcu,1587345125.0,"My opinion, useful but not S tier useful. I would put her at probably B or C.

When I am making a team that needs a tank even, she plays a very niche role.

The biggest problems I run into with her are her power debuff and rage attack doesn't always stick, and only hits a single enemy at a time. For bosses you need that to consistently hit or it screws you. Also if the boss had adds the adds can still attack your other units.

The other downside is her limited mp. OG Yuna usually fills the role of debuffer better even without the tanking.

Also, she's a slow unit, so often the bosses or whatever gets their hits in before the rage or debuff hits.

That said, Annabelle's ability to temporarily increase everyone's max health is very very useful. So that is a major plus about her."
