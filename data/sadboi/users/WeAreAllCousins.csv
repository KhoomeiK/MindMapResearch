SuicideWatch,fnmiw4t,t3_g2jkre,1587072233.0,"I hear you. This last year sucked, but I for one do not like the question you mentioned. This last year has been the worst year of my life. People I loved died, I failed at everything and seemed to only get worse the more I tried. The harder I tried, the farther I slipped. So I just said fuck it and did my best to stop caring for a while. I gave myself permission to use drugs for once... without feeling guilty. As much as I wanted. Found out that they only helped so much, and that the sweet spot was less than I thought.

I don't like the question you mentioned because it's putting the past year on some type of weird pedestal for no good reason. There are a lot of people who like me and you OP, for one reason or another, went through the worst year of their lives last year. Shit really hit the fan and it was one bad thing after another.

Maybe I'm just a sadist, but I still see beauty in a lot of things, and rarely happy things. Is it beautiful that two friends go to a movie together and have a nice time? Not so much. It's fine but boring. Was it beautiful when I woke up for 100th or so day in a row, still tired after 10 hours of sleep, and tried yet again without success to get stuff done that's been on my to-do list for ages? Yeah I actually see a lot of beauty in that. It's painful but beautiful. I see some beauty in trying and failing at something over and over, or having the sun set on a relationship with a friend. Don't get me wrong, I don't like being sad. But I'll still get my kicks in while the shithouse goes up in flames or whatever the fuck that dude said. 

It was a horrible, tragic year full of my constant failures and repeatedly not learning from my mistakes. My mental state is the least stable it's ever been and it really really sucks to be in my head and body right now. But there's still an abundance of beauty around me and what I experience every day. 

I agree that suicide is not selfish. Living is a choice we make, and no one else gets authority over it. Even if other people rely on or care about you, they don't get a say in the matter. That said, I've realized that I'm way TOO SELFISH to end it. Fuck other people, fuck things out of my control. I'm going to live selfishly and do what I want when I want as long as I'm not stepping on too many toes in the process. I still have fucks to give, but a very limited supply and most of it's for me. *Middle finger*"

I have decided that my physical health is important to me and so exercising is not an optional. It's hard to lose progress and feel like I'm starting over again, but I know that's not true. Many of the most successful people are usually people who have also failed the most in order to get where they are.

Honestly, it sucks not being good at habits and time management, but I still find ways to enjoy the process. I like strategizing and making new plans. Everytime I get a little better and it gets a little easier. I tell myself that what i am working on can't be fixed in a day, but I CAN do it eventually, whenever that might be. I finally have a daily schedule that is flexible enough to account for unexpected things without throwing me off too much. I have spent time figuring out my short term and long term goals, and I forgive myself when I get distracted or need time to rest. It's a slow painful process, but progress IS happening. Even if it takes me years to be able to successfully stick to my schedule and get things done in a timely manner, it will be worth the struggle. Even if I never get there, I'm happy with myself as long as I TRY. I know that's a pretty low bar, but that's the only thing in my control."

I've definitely noticed I recover more slowly after moderate to heavy drinking. Sometimes I'm only just starting to feel strong again before Friday rolls around. 

Just because some people can drink and still hit good times doesn't mean that the drinking isn't holding them back from running better. Whenever I take a solid break from drinking or at least really reduce I see dramatic improvement. That said, if you ARE going to drink, then try to minimize the impact by drinking a couple cups (yes a full16oz) of water and electrolytes as soon as possible after, ideally before bed. Eating soon will also help jumpstart recovery and replenish your gut biome. Force yourself to go for a walk or at least get the blood moving for a few minutes when you wake up. 

Still, it's way better for your progress to just drink less. It took me years longer than it should have to accept this. I get it though, sometimes you just need to let loose. Pro tip then: just down 2-3 drinks in an hour, get you a nice little buzz going, and then tapper off until you've sobered up a bit before starting round two (if you must, you heathen). You can't just pound those bad boys all night and then go out and run like Rudisha the next day.... Yes, I'm talking to myself more than anyone else at this point. Cheers!"

Not that you were, but we also should be careful not to paint all of the homeless people as indecent here. The article mentions one person going in public in front of others. The people interviewed said they don't do that and that they clean up after themselves, which is more than a lot of dog owners here can say. When you live outside in an urban area and have nowhere to go, literally any place you're forced to relieve yourself will be next to a business.

Fortunately Denver isn't the only city dealing with this issue. 24/7 public bathrooms are for sure the answer to people needing to relieve themselves at night. Looking at cities about the same size as Denver, Seattle has six and D.C. has eight 24/7 facilities, and both cities have acknowledged that these facilities are helping but they need more. So both cities recently passed legislation to continue expanding. Denver has zero 24/7 facilities. Denver Public Works started to ""assess"" the issue in 2018, but hasn't taken any action to my knowledge. Most public restrooms in downtown Denver are open 10am - 8pm. That's 14 hours per day that the homeless population is currently forced to try to hold it. In 2019, frankly that's shameful for a major metro city of any size.

Then they will be someone else's problem and all the other WANNABE homeless people will put the word out that Denver doesn't give out free rides. Yes, I know more and more people are volunteering to go homeless everyday, but I think homelessness will vanish if we just take a tougher stance. These guttertrash deserve what they get and will be happy with it ALL the charity that we have historically given them. I mean, Denver is notorious for doing EVERYTHING possible to help these useless pieces of human garbage. Denver aready provides public restrooms, and most are open 10am - 8pm. So the other 14 hours of the day they can just hold it in! All humans can do that no problem. So problem solved. I mean, why would Denver act like every other major metro city in the US and provide access to 24/7 public restrooms? Looking at similarly sized cities, Seattle has six and D.C. has eight 24/7 facilities, and they passed additional legislation to keep building more because they are working. But I'm sure those are all infested with heroine needles and junkies who, as we all know, are invincible to police. That's why Denver has zero 24/7 facilities and will continue to complain when these subhumans continue to act like animals and sh*t everywhere.

I have seen incredible results, and haven't even been very consistent with the exercises. I was -4.5 a year ago and now I'm at -1. I expect to be at 20/20 within the year. I know I sound crazy, but here is an entire forum of people with success stories returning to 20/20 https://www.iblindness.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=6. The forum has moved to the Facebook group Natural Eyesight Improvement. 

All of it is intuitive. Stop wearing glasses and contacts (as much as is safely possible). Remember how bad your natural vision got when you started using glasses? Use your eyes to focus at a distance at least 15 - 20 minutes per day. Put your screen/book as far from your eyes as you can, and then slowly increase this range week by week. Reading small print helps. Turn on more lights. Don't live in the dark. This gives your eyes more to focus on throughout the day. Take breaks from reading. Going for walks during the day helps also.

Yes, I know people with astigmatisms will have a harder time with this. And I'm nearsighted, so the process is going to be different if you're farsighted."

""African American"" also can sometimes be used to imply an otherness to blacks, as if they are foreigners that do not quite belong in American that I think is divisive and uncalled for. While people sometimes think that they are being politically correct saying African American, it usually stems from being unfamiliar with black culture.

Yes, there are of course exceptions, for instance a black person might say African American when emphasizing their heritage. But far and away, this is usually not the case."
running,f9hqd1m,t1_f9g71my,1575319675.0,"While it might not be for everyone, it's not inherently bad, and it can go a very long way in helping your running form, which is huge! A point that is often overlooked with barefoot/minimalist running is that it can take a while to transition to, especially for older or weaker runners. Transitioning too fast can cause injury. Even if you are pretty strong, the impact can be brutal on the lower legs and feet. Still, I think most runners should at least try minimalist shoes a bit for form practice. Maybe start with minimalist shoes on only a couple easy runs per werk and move up from there. I also agree with the book that zero drop shoes are better for form and reducing injury. 

Personally, I had persistent patellar tendonitis (below the knee) from running too hard on hard surfaces in high school (asphalt track, I kid you not). If I don't run consistently and stay strong, it always comes back. Nothing helped until I changed my strike to more mid/forefoot, and using minimal shoes really helped train me. I don't see much difference between barefoot and minimalist shoes other than protection from cuts. I had good form before, but just shortening my stride and changing my foot strike made a world of difference. I do believe this is how my body runs most efficiently. A lot of runners I meet seem to think that the best form for them is whatever they do ""naturally."" I think they overlook how much of their form is from habit and conditioning the body. We know that we can change what feels natural by persisting in a new form, which may be uncomfortable at first. Looking at East African runners, they spend a lot of time when young doing running form drills, a concept that has not spread much. They meticulously work on each part of the stride. A shoe with a high heel and an overabundance of cushion really changes your form and the mechanics of your stride. These shoes weren't popular until very recently. They might be nice for walking, but not running. 

So again, everyone is different, and barefoot/minimalist won't help everyone. However, it helped me, and I think it's worth a shot for most runners."

I'm only now getting better at realizing when I do this. I realized that I needed to practice maintaining focus more and not letting things distract me. The more I practice this, the easier it gets.

If you or anyone else is curious, you can try a quick mental reset I like to do to help me calm and focus my mind before starting the thing that I'm avoiding. Try to take 10 deep and fully relaxed breaths in a row while only thinking about relaxing and the breath number you are currently on. As new thoughts spring up, shut them down and return to breathing and counting. If you feel anxious and you're a shallow breather like I am, it may help to hold your breath for a bit before exhaling. This sounds simple, and sometimes it is, but when I'm anxious I often realize that I didn't even make it to breath 5 before I started an extended daydream. Once you do make it to 10, you should be more relaxed and it should be easier to focus."

Belief in God requires you to say ""I don't know... I can't prove it... But I have faith."" Saying you somehow mysteriously know God exists but can't prove it will only push non-believers away. This is like saying you have a superpower but your powers only work when no one is around to see. Most people will just roll their eyes."

Christianity,ezvbum1,t1_ezuc2sg,1568172819.0,">Nope, you're just pretending to misunderstand in order to invent stuff. If you had used the powers of critical thinking I am convinced you have, you would have read, in context, that I accidentally ignored the questions in your 2nd reply, but then intentionally ignored the stupid questions in your third reply. The best answer for inflammatory questions is no answer.

I'm asking you the same single question over and over again. I'm not being inflammatory. My question is an honest one, and I don't mean to offend you somehow by asking this. I truly want to know: do you think it's ethical to send someone to hell for refusing to believe in ancient claims of miracles and gods? Since you say your god is always ethical, then your answer would seem to be yes. But I really want to know what you think. You might have a different interpretation of the Bible than me and the other Christians I've discussed this with.

>Your standard of righteousness is not objective

Yes of course. Every ethical standard is inherently subjective. You have your opinions and I have mine. Your opinion is that the Christian God exists, and my opinion is that there is insufficient evidence upon which to base that claim. Since I do not defer to a book to decide my ethical standard for me, I make up my own mind as to what is right and wrong. This is what all people must do on a regular basis, since even god worshippers are forced to do so in the absence of having direct commands listed in their holy books. Just because something is written in a book doesn't make it objective, since anyone can write anything down. All people must subjectively decide what they believe to be true.

>with the whole ""magical stories"", you're being a jerk.

I truly don't understand why the term ""magic"" offends you. What I mean by magic is any supposed supernatural claim with little or no basis in science or the observable universe. This is one of the standard definitions of magic commonly used https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/magic. Darth Vader levatating people with his mind is a magical, or supernatural if you prefer, power. I can also say that the Islamic story of Muhammed splitting the moon in half by pointing at it is a story about magic because he supposedly recieved the power from a super natural source. This is no different than Jesus walking on water, Moses parting the sea, or any other of the thousands of magical powers or miracles people have claimed throughout history.

>There's plenty of evidence for the events of the Bible.

Yes and the same can be said about many religions' holy books. Just because the Bible references historical events does not mean that it's supernatural claims are true. Another way of saying this is that just because the Bible isn't 100% ficticious doesn't make it 100% true. I am only talking about evidence of the magical or supernatural claims of the Bible, not the events or teachings of a man named Jesus. The Bible itself is only hearsay, and so can't be said to provide evidence for its own unsubstantiated claims. In my opinion, it is much more likely that the Bible is a collection of old stories and myths that contains many valuable teachings. Yes this is my opinion and I'm sure your opinion will differ.

>God is ethical.

Not putting words in your mouth. Really wanting to know what you think. If your god is always ethical, then it must be ethical according to the Bible to send someone like me to hell if they don't believe in the Bible's claims about the existence of supernatural beings and miracles. That's my interpretation from reading the Bible. Do you interpret the bible differently?

>You might as well be berating some random friend on my FB list that you don't know: same conclusion. 

If a random friend told me that miracles are possible I would continue to politely disagree in the absence of sufficient evidence according to my own subjective opinion. It's reasonable to be skeptical of any supernatural claim in the absence of evidence. Are you not skeptical about the story of Muhammed splitting the moon in half? I'm not berating by asking honest questions. I am trying to simply understand your views, cousin. I have no ill will to you or your personal beliefs."
vegan,ezua9xu,t1_ezrpla2,1568148292.0,And a follow up question. How do you justify killing animals for fun when you can just drive to the store and buy plant-based alternatives and avoid stealing the rest of the animal's life?

You are contradicting yourself, so one of those two statements must be false. Why are you avoiding the question? Because there is only one rational answer: No, it is not justified to torture a person forever because, while they might have lived an extremely righteous life, they do not believe in magic and magical beings just because of some old stories told them to. 

""What I believe should happen or not is immaterial."" This amazes me. I asked if it's ethical to send someone to hell for not believing in magic without evidence, and your response is it doesn't matter what you personally believe is ethical. You are telling me that you are ok with following a god that acts unethically in your opinion in damning humans to eternal torture. You might as well say ""I dont think god is ethical but I'm scared of going to hell so I'll say I believe in magic based on no real evidence that would actually hold up in court.""

vegan,eztgqak,t1_eztapog,1568129931.0,"You got two arguments going here:

1- eating meat is healthier than not eating it - This is not true. Vegans live longer, healthier lives than meat eaters and have less heart disease, cancer, and stroke. The National Institute of Health says that a vegan diet is healthy for people of all ages, including infants and elderly. The vitamins and minerals you get from meat are widely available from other sources. Therefore you can't justify killing animals when you can just eat something else just as healthy, if not more so.

2- animals would overpopulate naturally - This risk does not justify killing and eating animals now just because a few might starve years from now. That's basically looking at a cow and saying, ""Sorry bud, your family might get really big one day a long time from now. I don't know for sure that will happen, but it could. If it does, a fraction of you might starve. So I'm going to go ahead and kill you now and remove any chance you might of had at living a full and peaceful life.""     As overpopulated as humans are already though, I doubt cows and pigs have much of a chance to establish themselves in great numbers in the wild but I'd happily take that risk any day if it means stopping the mass abuse, killing, pollution, species extinction, and environmental destruction that happens every day due to raising and killing animals for food."

Other religions make similar claims but those are all made up by humans obviously. But take my word for it, ours is the one true God though. You want evidence?

ZeroWaste,ezat7gz,t1_ezaitrd,1567807155.0,"A quick and dirty rundown...

This https://www.vegan.com/how/ has some good resources. I like the whole ""don't focus on cutting meat. Instead crowd out the meat"" approach. My wife got a little sad at first switching when she thought about all the foods she couldn't eat anymore. That went away after she found new products and recipes she enjoyed. The reality is that there are TONS of satisfying vegan foods, it will just take some experimenting to find out what you like. I became a way better cook after going vegan (necessity's the mother of invention and all that). 

Because I always stay stocked on an assortment of fruits and veggies, I really just worry about making sure I'm getting enough protein. I recommend at first at least counting your daily grams of protein. Most men should aim for at least 70 grams and women 50ish each day. Add at least another 30 each day if you're working out. Here's some random food/dishes I eat regularly that are easy:

Breakfast:

- cereal or oatmeal with soy or oat milk (oat milk is amazing if you've never tried it)
- fruit smoothie (I use soy, almond, or oat milk and add chia seeds and a vegan protein powder for extra protein after my morning workout)
- Amy's breakfast burritos or make my own
- tofu scramble (with nutritional yeast and black salt)
- bagel with cream cheese alt such as miyokos

Lunch or Dinner:

- tacos and burritos!
- ramen - surprisingly easy to make
- pb & j
- tofurky sandwiches
- hotdogs, burgers, and brats with fries - the Field Roast brand is amazing. Buy everything you can find. I also like Beyond Meat and Gardein. Some people prefer Boca. Burger King now does the impossible burger. I tell them to hold to mayo and put my own veganaise and extra ketchup on at home. Side note, Earth Balance is the way to go for good vegan butter.

- Grain + beans + veggies - An easy formula for getting all the amino acids you need is any grain plus any bean. Try to not just eat white rice and pasta. Find whole grains and ancient grains and practice different ways of adding flavor. 

Grains I like: basmati rice, brown rice, some white rice sure, pastas, quinoa, couscous (normal is good but also try pearled/Israeli), ancient grains mix, and then whole wheat bread (Dave's killer bread is usually easy to find). 

Beans: buy cans of black beans and chickpeas (garbanzo). I always keep three of each because they are easy to dump on a lot of things to boost protein. One of my favorite quick lunches is a can of soup, usually Amy's vegetable or lentil, and throw in some garbanzo beans. I also do a lot of lentils, green peas, edamame, and frozen gardein meat substitutes.

Veggies: nutritionists recommend making green leafy things a significant part of your diet. For me that's usually broccoli, brussel sprouts, lettuce/kale, asparagus, and french beans. I'll do cold salads but prefer to cook the other ones I mentioned and mix them in with my main dish. Other good veggie staples: bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, carrots, tomatoes, zucchini, potatoes.

Examples of the above: 

- pasta and gardein meatballs or meat crumbles
- rice/quinoa/couscous + black bean/garbanzo + sauted veggies + either soy sauce or do a butter and herb seasoning + hot sauce
- indian or Thai curries with basmati
-roasted potatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts, and garbanzos on couscous 

Snacks:

- mixed nuts
- fruit plate
- tortilla chips and guac or salsa
- pretzel crisps or veggies with HUMMUS!
- chickpea puffs (Hippeas)
- plantain chips
- Terra chips

Dessert: (one area where vegans really are not lacking at all)

- SO Delicious ice cream is bliss
- popcorn
- find a local bakeshop that does vegan. Pretty easy to make most recipes with vegan substitutes

Spices:

Go ahead and buy nutritional yeast (has a nutty flavor and is popular flavor in vegan cooking. Full of B vitamins and amino acids). Also buy black salt if you want to make tofu scrambles (smells and tastes like eggs). You'll start to collect all the other basics the more you cook."

Minimize the time your foot is touching the ground by making quick, powerful strikes. Then make sure you are bringing your knees up high enough. A lot of people keep their knees too low, forcing your lower leg to waste time swinging back and forth and causing extra stress on the knee joint. This will also decrease your stride length a bit. Last, your whole body should then naturally be tilted a little forward starting from the ankles (not bent from the waist). Don't force the tilt too much, but it will help cadence by making the ankle need to work less.

If you are used to heel striking, it will take a few runs to adjust your muscles to toe striking, which I think is the more natural and faster way to run since that's how we naturally run when we ditch the extra padded shoes. Run on a hard surface barefoot and your body should automatically increase it's cadence and adopt the toe strike. That's why I think minimalist, low profile shoes with little to no padding are the way to go. They really help with form."
