I've been struggling with how to balance the belief that he is truly happier now (he was severely ill and would not have been able to recover here, no matter how hard he tried) with some sense of hope for this life - life on earth. I've felt very stuck/hopeless since he left.

I have never heard of someone preaching of the value of this life in the context of grieving the loss of someone else. It seems so common sense typing this out but something about your phrasing and this thread got through to me.

Even if you don't like it, just give them the kindness of sharing something they love with them. That's all they want. A shared joy. 

My biggest regrets are not taking the time to watch the movies or listen to the music my brother was always recommending. He took his life almost 2 years ago and now all those movies and songs are missed opportunities. What could have been a piece of art to go to for a special memory shared with my brother, is now an empty thing of regret. I have watched some things since, and I see what he loved in them. They could be things to bring me joy, but they're just sad. I could have enjoyed them with him and I didn't."

Also, I agree with others that it would still be best to tell her ASAP. Waiting until she is ""recovered"" is kind of a vague term and with twin babies, there likely won't be a ""right time"" where you both feel fully recovered. You just gotta tell her so you can move forward together."

We weren't a horrivle family, but we were humans and there were days it was hard to love each other and we said or did things that weren't compassionate. I have the most regret over those. 

I also was out to dinner yesterday with some new people who didnt know about him and we got on the topic of siblings and I kept kind of intentionally saying ""when I had a brother"" or ""now that I'm an only child"" but they never actually asked me about him so I left feeling awkward. Like I'd talked about him in the past tense without really honoring him or at least explaining. Idk. It was weird. Idk how to talk to strangers about siblings yet.

It's truthful but simple and I like saying ""sick"" instead of ""mentally ill"" because I think it softens the stigma.
