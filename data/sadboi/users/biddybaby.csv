BipolarReddit,fr057og,t3_glkx7s,1589784111.0,You say you wish there was a cure for this illness that plagues you. So switch to a different form of birth control so you can take your mood stabilizers. Getting on the right meds and taking them properly is one of the closest things to having a ‚Äúcure‚Äù in my experience.
