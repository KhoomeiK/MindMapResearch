Advice,fmkuu60,t1_fmkts0z,1586169533.0,"People say the n word all the time without the intent of insulting a black person does that make it any more ok? (of course referring to a person that isn't white) People say the f*g word without intent of insulting someone who is lgbt does that make it any more ok? You're just being insensitive and unsympathetic to many people's feelings. It's a slur not an insult. So many other words can be used in it's place that come without a discriminatory background. 

But other than whether it's ok to say it or not you should at least be able to see why someone would be sensitive to the word and politely ask others to refrain from it's use rather than call them ""butthurt"" and dismiss their feelings entirely. 

Have some empathy man."
Advice,fmksbbt,t1_fmklpgy,1586166710.0,"Have you ever thought about reasons why the guy doesn't the like word.

Maybe he works with people with intellectual disabilities and helps them with getting a job, how to take care of themselves, and has to witness discrimination of them everyday. 

These are two real cases I know from friends who also dislike the r word and discourage others from saying it. Try thinking for a second why someone feels a certain way before you start being a cunt."
