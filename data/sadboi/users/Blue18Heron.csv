DuggarsSnark,fhqr6g6,t1_fhqiy04,1581809501.0,"Here is the Publisher’s Description:  is your quest to love yourself more actually making you miserable?  

We’re told that the key to happiness is self-love. Instagram influencers, mommy bloggers, self-help gurus, and even Christian teachers promise that if we learn to love ourselves, we’ll be successful, secure, and complete.  But the promise doesn’t deliver. Instead of feeling fulfilled, our pursuit of self love traps us in an exhausting cycle:  as we strive for self-acceptance, we become addicted to self-improvement. 

The truth is we can’t find satisfaction inside ourselves because we are the problem.  We struggle with feelings of inadequacy because we are inadequate. Alone, we are not good enough, smart enough, or beautiful enough.  We’re not enough — period.  And that’s okay, because God is. 

The answer to our insufficiency and security isn’t self love, but God’s love. In Jesus, we’re offered a way out of our toxic culture of self-love and into a joyful life of relying on him for wisdom, satisfaction, and purpose. We don’t have to wonder what it’s all about anymore.  This is it. 

This book isn’t about battling your not-enoughness; it’s about embracing it.  Allie Beth Stuckey, a Christian, conservative new mom, found herself at the dead end of self-love, and she wants to help you combat the false teachings and self-destructive mindsets that got her there. In this book, she uncovers the myths popularized by our culture of trendy narcissism, reveals where they manifest in politics and the church, and dismantles them with biblical truth and practical wisdom."
