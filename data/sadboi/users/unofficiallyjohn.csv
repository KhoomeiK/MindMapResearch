I'm also not talking about the technical qualities of the image here as an issue. I'm talking about a photographer's decision to put the milky way in a position that didn't really happen in real life (which i found true in many occasions). It robs the value of landscape astrophotography. You can just take one good milkyway shot somewhere and never have to do it again. Just photoshop it in all of your images. 

I am not necessarily referring to this particular photographer, but many who do this and in many cases, poorly."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ezmi82v,t3_d1hgpw,1567992318.0,"Captain. This is a composite image (2 images or more combined) so we have no knowing whether the milkyway was really in that position. It could be, or not. You cant create this image in a single shot, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Even I do this sometimes, but I always keep it as close to what it actually looked like to preserve its 'integrity'. 

There's a group in facebook that has lots of this stuff: Nightscaper. The downside is that the amateurs abuse the power of photoshop and just put the milkyway in all of their shots. They call it ""blended.""

Nice image nonetheless. It gives people an idea what you can see out there in the outdoors, and promotes the beauty of the lack of light pollution. You can actually see it with the naked eye (but not as vivid) under ideal conditions: new moon, no haze, clear skies, no town lights in several-kilometer radius."

2. That would make ALL battles difficult which is very time consuming. I don't want to spend all day seriously battling trainers that don't matter. This could work better if it were only applied to bosses, gym leaders, elite four.
3. I think it would make the game easier than it already is. My suggestion is that HM's be modified into better moves and types. e.g. Rock Climb being rock instead of normal. Cut being flying type (aerial ace?). etc

I think it would not only be difficult, but very very time consuming to the point that the creator would lose interest overtime and will start focusing on finishing the game instead of making it a good hack. I say keep the size manageable and focus on the quality.

Also about crossover, try pokemon dark rising worlds collide to see how it could play out. it has digimon. havent finished it though

You can also do ancient instead of futuristic like Apocalypse's story from XMen Apocalypse, or something like Pokemon Gaia (big fan of) but with a different story. Maybe more woods or ocean instead of rocks.

and with a twist in the middle and another in the end maybe

I'd recommend you also watch some good sci-fi movies beforehand

I think it's not a good idea to put all 700+ pokemon in the game. Maybe just less than 400, mix from different gens. I think 700+ is too much to be enjoyable."
