I'm running supermicro Xeon-D boards, 8/16 cores. I forget the Ghz and don't have the exact model off the top of my head (SD10NV or something like that). For OSDs I'm in a state of transition, I was using 2.5"" disks, but the 5TB seagates I had been upgrading to proved to have a high failure rate, really high. So I'm migrating to 3.5"" rust for cephfs data. These are attached to the six sata ports on the mobo. For my rbd pools and CephFS metadata each node has 1 NVMe drive, partitioned into 2 OSDs. I have space for one more each node, 3 drives arrived today actually, so I'll be expanding that tomorrow.. THose are attached to a supermicro 2 port PCI-Express switch.

There just a couple weeks ago been a new major release, Octopus, I had some upgrade issues with migrating to cephadm, OSDs don't seem to be adopting or creating successfully all the time, I suspect a race condition somewhere. I was able to just use the old systemd ceph-osd@.service to start the OSDs and effectively rollback the adoption. My MONs, MGRs, and MDSs all are managed by cephadm now though and that's pretty sweet.

That aside and one bug a couple years ago where CPU got pegged to 100% causing my mobo heat alarms to trigger (they'd run still, was just annoying. That bug was fixed within 24 hours.) I've had zero issues. It's rock solid.

The boards have 4 ethernet ports, 2 1Gbps, and 2 10Gbps. I LACP the 10s together for the ceph storage network, with the NVMe drive paritioned in two I use about 5Gbps backfilling, so I'm a bit over-kill there, but once I add a second I expect to pass the speeds a single 10Gbps link provides by a little bit. The 1s I LACP together to act as the front end. I do that since I only have two openstack nodes, and they are attached to 1Gbps network ports. New network switch should be arriving so those two nodes will have 10Gbps networking, by 5 nodes by 2 1Gbps ports should do a pretty good job of utilizing things more heavily.

Given that I'm using weak xeon-d boards I could experiment with paritioning the NVMe disks into 4 OSDs, that was the old recommendation in general a couple releases ago, but things have gotten more efficient. Ceph is approaching a new approach to I/O in the next couple of releases, which will alleviate some of the CPU bottlenecks present right now, it's called Crimson. I haven't read too much about it.

Feel free to ask any other questions you have. I'm just a home labber, but I think I have a decent working knowledge of ceph and openstack."

At that age I would mainly want to be accepted by my parent's. Dysmorphia sucks big time, it is terrible feeling the incongruities in your physical body compared to your mental body.

Regarding hormone treatment. I honestly, even though I identify as trans myself, think that is a bit young to start treatment, BUT, results are better before puberty. So what to do? I think the answer here is hormone blockers. They help delay/prevent puberty and from what I understand the big side effect to worry about it your kid ending up a little taller. If they find themselves not feeling dysmorphia by the time they are a bit older or if they want to transition, then either discontinie the blockers and/or start HRT as appropriate.

schizoaffective,flwakbu,t3_fr6b2g,1585544312.0,"So this is a tricky topic for a lot of people with any illness with a genetic component. I think it's ultimately going to be a personal choice. My wife and I decided to have a baby, and did successfully (Ellie was born just this past December 19), I'm going to share our reasoning.

Our main concerns were both of our health. My wife has ADHD, anxiety disorder and Crohn's. Some history of depression. I myself have problems with anxiety, but as the flair says, schizoaffective bipolar subtype as well. It took my a good year of thinking on things before deciding I was okay with having a child that was genetically mine.

To help reach this decision I first looked around other posts for various illnesses (mainly schizophrenia, there's just a lot bigger communities for them), but there was a post i came across I believe in /r/parenting that was by a geneticist in response to someone's worries. His point was that basically everyone's genes suck. My genetic perspective is that pretty much we evolved to reproduce at a young age, that we can do so successfully is all that evolution optimizes for. Cancer, heart conditions, all that sort of fun stuff, tends to hit after peak reproduction age, it doesn't get ""breed out"" of our species.

To be more certain though we got refered to a genetic counsellor by our psychiatrist. They took our health histories, in a very long interview, and talked to their genetics people. Basically for our illness, given that I have it and my grandfather had it, the odds were 15% I'd pass it on genetically. They emphasized that that was the genetic risk, then there is the whole environmental side. My wife and I are stable in our health conditions and are familiar with which medications work for us, so if they do get either of our conditions we have a good start on which medications to try. We are good financially, so we plan already to put our daughter in regular therapy from a young age. Being a kid is tough, regardless of family history. Basically we want to try to avoid giving her any bad trauma, give her lots of love and affection, and for the ADHD try to keep screen away from her until 2.

For schizophrenia (more research on that than schizoaffective, though I'm sure the genetics are probably the same in a lot of cases) it's interesting to note that for identical twins if one has it, the other only has a 50% chance of it.

After we talked to the genetic counselor we then got a referral to a women's health concerns clinic to talk medication. They looked at mine as well, but there just isn't much research on men. We made their suggested changes and then went on to try for conception.

I can't speak to your financial situation, that's always a tough one. My wife and I are fortunate that she has a well paying job. But for the schizoaffective side I think one can make a good case for not ruling out children. Will you face criticism for it? Probably at times. but people judge for every little thing when it come to children.

I will warn you though that is our three months so far that having a little one was and still is very hard. We don't really have family here, so we were largely on our own, with some limited doula help in the first couple weeks. There were a lot of emotional breakdowns from both of us. We survived though, somehow. Now it's easier, but still very draining. I want my 12 hour sleeps back! But then I see her smile and know it's worth it. Now waiting for her to be able to laugh.

Feel free to PM me if you want to chat privately."

In Ontario, Canada, there is one Hamilton, we went there to talk about my wife's medications before we tried for a baby. They were very reassuring and helpful."
