It goes without saying, it's a must-play exclusive on the Vita. Developed by Bend Studio, the action in this 3rd person adventure plays and feels just like the home console versions.

Killzone: Mercenary - 
Besides being an excellent first person shooter, this Vita exclusive REALLY shows what the Vita is graphically capable of. It's impressive. I own and have played every Killzone FPS, and in my opinion, this is the BEST Killzone on any console.

Muramasa Rebirth - 
Wanna see the beauty and splendor of the PS Vita 1000 OLED at its finest? Play this action platform. Show your Switch owning friends what a real quality handheld display looks like and how to properly use a Katana using the Oboro style.

Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale - 
I don't care what anyone says, this game is just fun. It may look like a Super Smash Bros clone at first glance, but charging up your super changes the formula and the dynamic levels are really cool.

Persona 4 Golden - 
This dungeon-crawler-RPG-life-simulator is kind of difficult to discribe, at least not in a way that would do it justice. Some say it is the reason to buy a Vita, Some say it is the best game on the Vita. I say it is one of the best RPGs I've ever played. The story really makes you care about the characters in the game and the battles really challenge you to adapt as you level up.

Tearaway - 
The game was ported to PS4 as Tearaway Unfolded. But the PS Vita will always be the best place to play it. The game takes the more gimmicky features of the Vita and makes them feel useful. It's a lot of fun and encourages creativity.

Super Stardust Delta - 
A great pick up and play game. Cool sound effects, sweet particle effects fast-paced, arcade action."
