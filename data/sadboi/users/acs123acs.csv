check everything. not just like lights and radio. but your emergency stuff (is the jack still there... spare tire etc... window sprayers work...)does every button work like its supposed to. 

is it rusting out on the bottom. (walk away if it is....you are only seeing part of the damage/neglect

check the vin/carfax to see if its been in an accident

if you are at a dealer and you dont want a switch pulled on you. write down the vin of the car you want. that way they cant give you a different car that has the same make/model

NEVER tell them your budget.  they will either charge right at it or just over it. you can say things like this is a bit higher than im expecting but ill know the price when i see it. 

negotiate. you can almost always get the price lowered (sometimes by like 20%...i got mine from 5500-6000 to 5000 tags and fees include). in negotiation you can say that a price isnt good and give them silence... they sometimes will try to negotiate...

if you have your mind set on a car and in negotiations its still a bit to high. walk away. often they will run after you to get the sale. 

CASH is king. they will work with you for the sale (if you buy outright they do not have to worry about default on a payment... they will take a lower price)

see if you can get preapproved for a loan at your bank with an estimated price range before you go to the lot. that way you have a “blank check” to write and will not be subject to their more expensive loan rates/credit checks etc.

during test drive push it see how it handles under hard acceleration/braking (do it safely though) to see if the brakes are spongy (they might need replcing)

if you see damage that needs repaired during negotiations bring it up. can help lower the price when you explain how its going to cost more to repair X, Y or Z. (if its a minor repair they might fix it for you to make the sale). 

if you can avoid it dont by a car “as is”. certain states will protect you under lemon laws. others wont. buyer beware. (i.e. if the engine breaks on day 1 then they would not be liable if you bought as is. it will be your job to fix it. )

if a car needs major repairs/ has frame damage  walk away. the cost to fix isnt worth it. 

if you look at a car head on and the bumper/grill/lights dont look symetrical. walk away. most likely frame damage. (any damage to frame will not protect you as well if your in a wreck)

open up the hood. if there are different colora (say the hood is green on the bottom and the car coat is red) it
had components replaced/damaged at one point.) (at factory its all painted one color). 

check electrical (fuse box locations and is the puller still there). 

with electrical make sure your car isnt like mine. the highbeams turn off when you use your right turn signal. (electrical issue)

check the date on the battery. will let you know if you will need a new battery soon.

use kelly blue book/price estimators to make sure you are not getting ripped off

LifeProTips,fgetcse,t1_fger328,1580709282.0,"alright not sure about you but i live in a high population density area. not getting sick is partially about good habits and partially about preventative care (vaccines)

so alot of buildings around hear are considered high rise building. these building typically have a mechanical room on each floor that pulls return air from the ceiling plenum and pushes it back out through ducts amd diffusers. this is a cycle that is on a continous loop (over simplified i know). 

now because of this if a person is coughing up a lung in room A and air is returned through the ceiling plenum the airborne pathogen can travel all the way to the central air handling unit. if this unit does not carry the proper filtration systems the unit will take the pathogen laced air and redistribute it throughout the floor. 

while yes this is in low doses your body still has to fight it.  so in these cases you are “lucky” if you are not exposed to it. 



continuing on.

it actually is pretty accurate to say luck rather than anything else. for instance lets say your body is a car. you know the road you are travwling very well and know that a mile stretch ahead of you is covered in nails. now you cant go around this small section as this happens every year. what you can do is isolate the location and wait for someone to clear the way at the end of season. you could try to do things like prep your car with a plow to move the nails out of the way (washing hands). or not take paths others have taken since they piled the nails even worse (not share food drink). even still you could put on puncture proof tires (vaccines) but none of these will guarantee you wont get a flat (sick). its just that every bit helps."
