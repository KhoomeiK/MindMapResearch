When you lie down your body naturally tends to breath with the diaphragm. Overthinking about breathing doesnt help, but it'll - at least - allow you to figure out your diaphragm.

Second, hold something slightly heavy with both hands in front of you, like a small chair or something. You can let it slack so your not extending your arms, but dont let it rest on your stomach to hold it. (If it's too heavy, get something a bit lighter so you don't hurt yourself.) Your body will use your abs to hold up that chair which will project your voice. We would sing our show choir numbers with chairs sometimes lol.

Unfortunately, I can not compare it to the Harvest Moon on Wii - the real-time season one (I personally did not enjoy it) - and Stardew Valley.

Maybe the thing I didnt like was that you have all the buttons on the switch and you maybe use 3 of them. But I'm super used to BotW so that could be the button issue.
