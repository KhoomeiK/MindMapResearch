I’ve heard other reports like that too but the way I see it, if you’ve already smoked weed and have never had thought loops prior to psychedelics then I wouldn’t worry about it. You could however, smoke so much weed that you trigger flashbacks of prior trips but it’s not always the case. Even then, id say you should be okay, I would look recommend you stay off psychedelics for a few weeks if you just had a really shattering experience. Give it some time so you can process and heal, then return to the trip once you’re in a good state of mind again"

egodeath,fmgw5fe,t1_fmgvxix,1586059449.0,"Yeah thought loops can be a rollercoaster for sure, but I’d say we do free will isn’t as simple as having it or not having it, I think free will has a spectrum almost. Anyway, thought loops are definitely terrifying when in them but pay attention to them, you’ll learn about your habitual thought process or sometimes people will repeat their actions over and over and these actions could be telling you about your habits in every day life"
egodeath,fmfkjot,t3_fuw2lc,1586029178.0,"Ego traps are usually things like constantly pointing out what’s wrong in the world but not providing solutions or thinking you know more than others because you’ve had an ego death  or thinking you’re more spiritual than others because you’ve had intense revelations. Point of ego death is to realize that we are all the same, no one soul is different than another, it’s all the same energy. It gets the best of us though, we all fall to the trap sooner or later but I think getting back up and learning to let go of your ego again is part of the dance"

egodeath,fmb2l5l,t3_fu3mwz,1585916560.0,"Stay off of psychedelics and weed for a while, just get yourself in a clear state of mind to process everything. It’s completely normal, dude you had an ego death which regardless of dose is intense as fuck for everyone lol of course it’s normal to feel anxious and concerned about what you experienced. Maybe the lingering anxiety you’re feeling is depersonalization? I’m only assuming, if so then yeah take my advice of laying off of psychs and weed for a minute. You can always be the same person you were before, or you can be better than who you were before, just take the time to reflect on what you experienced and what you learned and decide for yourself what information will take you further. Take it easy on yourself for now! Stay safe, spread love and wishing the best for you on your journey my friend. Best wishes, hope this was a bit helpful  to you 💞🍄🦋"

bipolar,fkzjim6,t1_fkzfreh,1584672489.0,"Yes I do have bipolar disorder, don’t mediate as often as I’d like though it’s a tough habit to keep but one thing that has helped is writing down things I’m grateful for as often as I can and occasionally conditioning myself to change my mindset, on rare occasion I use psychedelics but I’m careful about when I use them so that it doesn’t trigger an episode. And about healthy people being happy by default that’s bullshit, everyone has problems trust me. Everyone is trying to find peace it’s a never ending journey but I think that embracing the struggle can be liberating because it’s empowering to know that despite the bullshit you can still get up and face the day. Even if that means just getting through the day, you’re still brace enough to face the day and that’s what counts. And you can fix this!! It takes time but believe me once you put the time and effort in you’ll look back and think “wow ive grown in such short notice” trust me because I used to have very long depressive episodes but I can feel myself getting better, still struggling with the manic episodes here and there but it’s all part of the process. I don’t think anyone reaches a point where they feel completely normal or perfect but I believe everyone can reach a state of contentment with their current moment and once you can have that, everything else will fall into place. This might sound like some corny bs if you’re depressed right now because I know motivational speeches don’t work on me when I’m depressed either, but just give it a shot! You got this!!!"
