I understand OP's idea and I agree with what others are saying, your parents shouldn't have to store your stuff. But I think its also situational, my sister doesn't have to pack toys for my niece when she sleeps over and we don't have to worry about finding a toy she left behind. Just make sure everything is sanitized! :)"

relationships,fq4gp3b,t3_ggnnxc,1589077525.0,"I had a slightly similar situation. I just had to keep talking to my husband, for example, I had  to tell him multiple times that I don't like having my butt grabbed all the time. 

In the beginning of our relationship we were more handsy then we are now, so as things cooled down and my preferences changed I told him I didn't like my butt being grabbed all the time.  He kept doing it (not maliciously, hear me out) so we kept having the same conversation. It was really frustrating because it was literally the same conversation every time but sometimes he'd forget (medication related). So eventually I asked him what did intimacy, romance, and affection mean to him. He answered that grabbing my butt meant affection. A-HA!! I explained to him that I didn't view it that way, I viewed it as he wanted to initiate sex or sexually tease me but because my libido has decreased and more often than not when I did get horny he'd lose interest (medication and illness related). I began to get mad whenever he did it. That conversation was a game changer. He asks if he can grab my butt or if he can do something else and respects when I say no. He also tells me when he wanted to do something but knew I wouldn't like it so he did something else. I sincerely thank him and the effort he's putting forth and acknowledge that he is trying to change a behavior."

He hid how severe his depressive state had gotten until it came out it a fight. Before the fight, he had told his therapist that he was doing fine and they agreed to meet when he needed to rather than a set schedule. We hen I found out how bad he was (thankfully he already had an appointment with his therapist that week) I wrote his therapist a letter detailing the fight, what started it as it was relevant, and what he hadn't told her.

My point is, even if she ends up finding a therapist she could not discuss everything. I see that your in mental health so I'm probably repeating something you already know. But just something to think about. 

Also couples therapy. My husband is very bad at talking about feelings and has a difficult time expressing his thoughts (which to his credit he has improved on) but I found that seeing a couples therapist helps better our communication.
