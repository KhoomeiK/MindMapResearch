The only idea I have for being able to continue working while you have the lotion on is gloves. For nighttime itching when lotions aren't working I put an ice pack on mine. The cheap hot/cold packs from the pharmacy section of stores work the best. At times when the itching has been the worst and most widespread I've completely submerged my hands or feet in a big bowl of ice water. It's not fun, but it's the only thing that stops the itching so I can sleep."

Dr increased to 150 BID and I had an absence seizure 2 months later. Increased again to 200 BID and I've been seizure free for nearly 4 years.

It is hotter than a normal blanket, so I have to keep the temperature in the room a couple degrees cooler than I used to."

Pete_Buttigieg,evm5pe2,t1_evgxo13,1564603618.0,"Did you hear the interview with Adam Schiff? I was all on board with impeachment, even knowing he'd get to stay. And I hate when they use politics as a reason not to do it.  BUT Adam Schiff said if they do it and the Senate acquits him (which they will) then we may not be able to charge him with the crimes once he's out of office because of the Senate decision. That's the most persuasive argument against it that I've heard because I want that monster in jail.

If they don't do it this term then I have a feeling if, God forbid, he's re-elected and Dems keep control of the House then they'll impeach him in January 2021.

I doubt there's a single person in Congress who thinks he's innocent and doesn't deserve to be kicked out of office. Mayor Pete implied as much last night."
