BulimiaAndAnaSupport,fr3oghg,t3_gm3qc4,1589862071.0,"I have done this. I got a Mallory weiss tear to the lining of my esophagus from the force of vomitting.

I think the rule of thumb is if you vomit up more than 2tbsp of blood, you should get checked out. I went to the ER but ended up being okay.

Fortunately in most cases, the tear clots on it's own pretty quickly. But you should let it heal fully before purging again. I waited a full 10 days after mine. To be honest I tried to purge before the 10 days but it actually hurt, I could feel the strain on the old tear.

If you continue to vomit blood, get checked out for sure. If not, take it easy for awhile and try your best to avoid purging.

Stay safe <3"

If it has been a long time, and it is worrying you, consider asking the advice of a doctor, if the bloat is significant maybe they can figure out the exact reason why it is happening (eg. Is it a lot of gas in the digestive system, is it swelling, is it water retention, constipation, etc) and recommend something or prescribe something to help."

I would say taking some time to think about it, and deciding whether or not you are ready to be honest with your treatment team.

 If you are honest with them, chances are you wont be discharged in 2 weeks, and things might change with your treatment and get better, because they know that what they were doing already hasnt been helping you.

omad,fncvhhy,t3_g0y0d3,1586848601.0,"You will lose some muscle no matter what, I believe.

I saw a youtube video by i think the Goal Guys (?) about alternate day fasting, basically doing OMAD every other day while keeping up exercise and training to try and cut fat without losing muscle, he did a DEXA scan before and after his routine to actually check his fat percentage vs muscle percentage  before and after I think 30 days or something and he lost some of both fat and muscle in spite of his training.

It was a really interesting watch, actually!"

TwoXChromosomes,fnb8w78,t3_g0hmgi,1586811272.0,"I mean. Surviving and overcoming rape doesnt make you a good person either.

If the allegations against her about her husband are true, her circumstances do not absolve her of that. The restraining order her husband had against her claiming abusive and threatening behaviour is already enough that I do not view her as a good example.

Basically no one in that show is a good person. They are all villains."
intermittentfasting,fn94pd4,t3_g08x2a,1586759330.0,"I mean...OMAD means no eating for 23 hours, and then a 1 hour feeding window.

So if you can eat a meal and then also a snack in that 1 hour, then yes.

If you eat outside of that 1 hour, you are not fasting, so you are either on a more lax schedule (20:4, 16:8) or you are just restricting your calorie intake by a lot without fasting.

Personally I like snacks, so when I do IF I do a 20:4 so i can have a snack while I'm cooking my one big meal, eat my one big meal and have one more small snack after. Kindof like OMAD but with appetizer and dessert. But even then, it's not technically OMAD, it's just IF."

Stay safe out there."

Spent a couple hours in the ER because I purged a bunch of blood (spoiler alert: I'm fine).

The doctor kept asking like what happened to make me like this in my 20s, saying it was weird because these usually start when you are a kid, asking all of these questions basically being like Y U A STUPID HO?

And I'm just like doc, idk why I'm so dumb just tell me if I need to be concerned about all the blood in my vom, and I'll be outta here real quick

I feel like shiiiiiiit."
