Also I like being busy and if people ask me to do this or that (obviously little things or its something really important) then I am happy to do it for them. Probably did it a lot in my first job and I bet everyone thought I do it for them but actually there is a big a** explaination why I do this for myself. Just never bothered to explain it so I bet they see me under them while I am good on my own here. Also I bet some friends of mine think I am a lesbian just because I dont bother to explain that I am probably aromantic. My point is tho that I like doing nice things just for the sake of being nice.

I'm glad to hear that you found out that this way of being doesnt fit for you and you got out of there. I too dont crave to much physical affection but I have to admit that when me and my friend had a breakdown on new years eve and slept beside while holding eachother in the arms, I dreamt about this days after it too. Got over it tho. It was great but I am good on my own and this is so important. The strenght to distance yourself from people can get you far and helps if it happens."
selfimprovement,fqx4kkr,t3_glcxft,1589725657.0,This is incredible! It so important for people to understand that you cant possible depend on another person. A partner wont ever solve all your life problems but you can. Lifting the stress lf your shoulders to find someone who can is the best you can do. You will have great friends that - if you need physical affection - still can hug you and caddle with you. But not to depend on this feeling is so powerful! And just by the way... I figured being so needy for a relationship can be very ugly. I have a friend like this and I understand but it wont get you anywhere. It also will be more hurtfull to have to be break up or be left by someone when you feel dependent on a romantic relationship

I have to admit that I dont see people too often for them to realize but even if it wouldnt bother me. I still shower and stay hygenic. I wash my clothes and all that so normally I should not smell. Most of the time at some point I get to this exact topic in a conversation and explain how I love being comftable with my clothes and not having to struggle with what I want to wear everyday. Most of the time people think its cool but still rather stick to having more options. Completely okay. The only thing I keep track of is that I can transform this look into something professional for which I have one blazer. You can wear that to job interviews and stuff. People can think its weird. I dont mind but if somenody would ""call me out"" I would rather think that they are weird. Why should they care?! I look good every day of my life without even trying. What do they want to call me out for? Why would you judge someone for a black t-shirt and grey jeans? I mostly wear stuff from H&M because I dont really have much money and they provide me with good basic stuff.

Btw: Did you know that if you buy the same black sneaker socks every time you can just throw them in the sock box in your dresse and match them with any other sock in there? If one sock is missing or has a hole you dont have a lonely sock since you can match it with every other sock in there."

I wanted the highbed since I moved into a place with an incredible high ceiling but I figured I am effing lazy and dont want it. Got rid of most of it. At the moment I am a little bit in a money hole because of corona but as soon as I have a little more I want to modify my bed so the space under it can be used as ""shelves"" while still being able to pull it out to sit on it if people are over. Then I can get rid of the one shelf of Ikea. Otherwise I am still about to sell the little ones and get myself a propper leg rest matching to my couch.

Thank you for teaching me to actually change something myself if I need it but this is no help for a 4th grader against a school! Years later my mom has serious problems with the ward management in the hospital she worked at.

It was horrible since she could do only so little since those people were over her in the pyramid. She also vent about it at home at dinner. My brother is really good at seeing things rationally and tho he doesnt stand on any sides it probably seemed like he is against my mom while he was thinking about the reasoning of those people that made the life of my mom shitty. I was just quiet. I dont know how to fix it and the whole situation seemed kind of weird for me. Then my mom broke down and told my brother that she felt like he is taking the other side and that she just wants a little support. Understandable but in that moment I knew why it felt so weird. She was literally in the same position as me (while still in a more serious place) and asks for just a few nice words. I nearly laughed so hard since this is what I wanted to and havent gotten from her ever when I came to school.

Keep in mind that the school failed so much to teach you about life that you dont even know what can be out there. Maybe take a year off if your parents or wherever you live allowes it. Maybe its completely useless that I wrote it but it just helped me so much to at least make the hole not as deep as it was before.

socialskills,fou7pjs,t3_g9jzdu,1588078313.0,"This is probably a good way to build opinions which I have problems with. Maybe I should really start fact checking everything. Thing is that not always your opinion was asked for. Sometimes its more about listening. Then one thing reminds you of the other. and so on. Another big problem is that a lot of people on this earth wont see this post. There are a lot that also dont know how to hold a conversation. And then you have to drag the convo on your own shoulders. I always felt like if you guys are people that match in any kind of way then it doesnt matter if its the shittiest small talk at the beginning. Talk about the weather in an ironic tone. If the other person is also interested in talking to you then this person will talk. Most of the time its just a matter of who starts. Also sometimes people dont want to talk. Then maybe its a good moment to just let them alone or just sit beside them not forcing anything. Once you learn how to be comftable in silence then a conversation will be less scary.

Little personal tip: I am weird. Of course it can scare people away but I figured a little slight taste of my personality combined with a question you have to answer with more than just yes or no can help get people interested and more willing to talk to you. You must know I am from germany. We have a TONS of different kinds of bread. Also from place to play the words for those breads can also change. It so happened that my colleague and friend asked me to bring her a 'Water bread buns' (Wasserbrötchen) to work with. I laughed my a off and couldnt believe that she called normal bread buns (brötchen), 'water bread buns'! I had to ask her first what she meant. We then argued if this is a normal word and where she came from people would actually call it that way. Now I can casually go to people and ask the random question ""What would you imagine when you hear the word 'water bread bun'?"" People get confused, I prove my point to my friend again and again that it isnt normal and the people I asked then asked where this is ckming from and we have a convo. Hope this is helpfull. Doesnt help always but I guess there are some people that cant stand weird.

Anxiety,fne9qur,t3_g14yme,1586885529.0,Those people are not supposed to judge you and most definetly not outloud even if she probably didnt wordly say you are a drug addict. You have a prescription on your name and a personal identifying document with you? You are free to go. But I understand that its hard with anxiety. Just be sure that those people arent everywhere and normally pharmacists should know how to behave in their job. You are not an addict because you need a little help with your anxiety. Breath and think about your options. You could go when someone else is working there. You could go to another pharmacy or make your psychologist/ therapist call them to make things clear but I think number one or two are the easiest. Take your time and this will be over soon. I wish you the best.
nosleep,fnanngb,t1_fnafc4l,1586800619.0,"I am sorry to hear that.  Your son is very young. I think if you do not want to talk to a psychologist you could try to actually teach him. Lay the focus on his problem to understand certain things. Hopefully it is just a phase but then he himself can learn out of it. Keep in mind that if he is realising what he has done that it could upset him so take your time. And when he grows up try to talk about it from time to time. Teenager sometimes remember random things of their childhood and start questioning their whole existence. They have questions but are too afraid to ask. He is not supposed to feel like a bad person. He should just learn whats okay and what not. Give examples. Explain death to him since he had already touched the topic and its important not to leave wholes in a learning curve. I know you probably do not want to hear about it since it got already disproven but maybe just from time to time if things shouldnt get better find a doc just to look if he doesnt has asbergers or something like that. Go to different doctors. A lot of people get overseen with it because it has such a large range of habits, tics or however you call it. Some things also form over time. But I dont want to go too deep into it. With some time and efford I am sure you can achieve something with your son. Kids can be weird. Some more and some less. And they do dump stuff. Let there be kids that do REALLY dump stuff. Its tragic yes. But it can happen. He thinks he did something good. Just keep in mind to look out for yourself too. If you feel overwhelmed you can go to a doc for yourself. I am sure its pretty overwhelming to see your own kid doing something like that. I wish you and your son the best."
escaperooms,fnaeicc,t3_g0igbi,1586796097.0,"Thats so cool. We had a magnet door in a room once that would open when you do the right knocking sign. Didnt work really well since this was a room my boss and his friends build together. Tho I have to say that it was impressive to even come so far it wasnt good enough for a public escaperoom. You had to calibrate it constantly as well as a skale you had to reach a certain weight. These are incredible cool puzzles but if they dont work its just frustrating.

To the video: Keep in mind that not every customer will have the right knocking speed and leave lager breaks with faster knocks or something like that. If they have the right answer but it fails because of this it could be a bit frustrating."
nosleep,fn9kd8l,t3_g0dxac,1586776306.0,"If you explain it carefully nobody will take him away from you. You should seek up a child psychologist. Like you explained to your son, he himself is in a good home. It just seems like your sons brain works a bit different which should be worked on. What happened is tragic and maybe even traumatic (for you guys and your son) but it was a misktake you son just needs to learn. Sometimes humans make little mistakes which turn into major consequenses that nobody could have seen coming. Try to be calm. Seek help and try to just keep it down for you and for him for now."

Please do not try to make it special because I will feel sooooo uncomftable. This is not the point of this. I cant even stress enough how much I hate to tell people my birthday.

AmItheAsshole,fmzdyab,t3_fy4dc0,1586516940.0,"NTA. Even if it doesnt affect them and they dont turn out homophobic kids when they are older sometimes remember little parts in their childhood. I bet they wouldnt feel good themselfes if they would remember playing this game. Also the could be a little ""ok boomer"" hidden in there when they think about why their parents lets them play this game.

If you need a good game for your kids, a good one I am playing with my former neighbours was this ""I am packing my suitcase"" game. (At least in german we call it like that for some reason). Normally it would be just
""I am packing my suitcase and I put a dvd in it""
""I am packing my suitcase and I put a dvd in it and my dog""
""I am packing my suitcase and I put a dvd, a dog and a lawn mower in it.""
etc.

Then you just go around and every time someone else is putting something new in the suitcase (not actually of course). We modified the game and did it with cartwheels, dance moves, handstands, etc. I hope it is kind of understandable how I explained it. It is really funny and it doesnt matter if you cant do a cartwheel or not. Its just about remembering everything and then doing it."

Its weird when you think about telling her something like ""yo you know this is not what we are obligated to do right?"". Obviously but I guess if you word it something like ""Hey. I love talking to you and doing stuff together but to be able to do this I sometimes need to charge up my social battery by doing my own thing by myself. Beeing solo. Not talking. A lot of people have this and I do too. I would appreciate if you could respect this if it looks like I am in my calm quiet space or in my room or something like that.""

Also me an my flatmate have this thing where we just leave our door open if we are cool to talk. If we need quet time its closed (also when we get intimate in our rooms obviously but thats not the point). You are allowed to feel good in your own space. Maybe she even feels uncomftable sometimes to but like I said doesnt know the concept of 'we dont have to talk'.

AmItheAsshole,fmj19xw,t3_fvfpkq,1586121021.0,NTA. I worked in a customer entertaining field (escaperoom) for a long time and I will never forget how some parents were fighting about a puzzle they had to do. Their little son (11ish) suggesting something and they shushed him down because apparently parents know more. Wasnt the first time something like that happens there but the little boy was so amazing he just ignored them and tried some stuff himself. He basically did the whole room by himself in complete calmness. I have to admit he wasnt exited eighter but at least he looked confident and knew how to work around his parents to get to his goal. It seems to me that you are just like that. Just doing your thing and knowing that thing is good. I wish you a great life!

If we all say the truth... could we still decide to say nothing instead of something bad? Because I mean we decide if we want to talk right? Why should it be different just because we say the truth now?"

This is maybe a harsh example but if shows how much you put yourself in the stagd light. The Pain of others is isnt as important as your pain?

But I could be completely wrong too. Maybe you have a psychological issure in your brain that keeps you from feeling empathy. This is not sarcastic and I totally mean it. Lack of empathy can be really serious."
AmItheAsshole,fmhtfp1,t3_fv72sd,1586092994.0,NTA. I assume you just exploded. Something like that happens. I do not know how good you can talk to your family but maybe explaining to them that beeing healthy makes you feel better physically and mentally. You wont force it on them but you need to live your own life. You will raise healthy kids and if they want to eat unhealthy they can do it anyways when they are older. If your kids heard all that stuff your family said about you having an eating disorder maybe talk with them about what is going on. Why you eat salad instead of fries and that this doesnt mean that you have an eating disorder. Just so they arent afraid of something they may not understand yet. Also I can just recomment going home. Its probably the best for everyone to keep the peace.

AmItheAsshole,fmhn263,t3_fv0n38,1586086906.0,"ETA. A pet can be great way for people to have a break from their mental health issues and learn about many things. You (or your wife. It should be a decision you both made together) decided to get her a dog and commited to everything that would come with it. Every exiting new thing but also every problem. You took the lucky card! You daughter actually cared about the dog and her well beeing got better. Other kids would play with the dog for a week and get bored of it quickly, leaving the parents with taking care of it. I get that it is sonetimes hard to train a dog and it also can be a financial burden but just imagine if you needed to go to the vet with it. You dont abandon a dog just because it gets hard. You didnt gave away your daughter when she turned out to have depression. You commited to it! Also it is taking a toll on the dog too. They do not understand why something is happening. They just notice how they dont have their family anymore. If that happens more often they will get trust issues.

In addition to this I have to say that the way you decribe how your daughter is talking to you could be defined as emotional abuse. Manipulation. It probably came together with her depression and I dont know her age but she is accusing you of not loving her. Beeing the villain in her story. You probably just thought you did the right thing.

Please overthink all this again. Figure out what options you have. Nobody can convert you so I dont want to say get the dog back but you now should see where you want to go. You probably dont want to lose your daughter. I promise you she doesnt want to hate you but she feels unheard and will act like it."

offmychest,fm2ogh7,t1_fm2l9cp,1585701781.0,Actually yes. I can interact with people outside of telling them to remember the rules but sometimes it just isnt possible. With that amount of people there (before corona) you need your eyes and ears everywhere. Also I could not leave my zone in that moment so I simply made clear that they cannot behave that way again or we have to remove them from the court completely. I also explained to my coworkers to have an eye on them and asked the kids to take a short break with their parents to cool down. To talk to both kids individually to asure them that they know what they did but also that they are okay would have taken too much time. Not in that environment with this much happening around them. Also as egoistic as it sounds I think raising kids is in the hands of their parents. They can influence them so much better. They can really get to them.
