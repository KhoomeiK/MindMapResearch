mentalhealth,fophuba,t3_g8sefi,1587961880.0,There is a genetic link the best place to start is to see a regular Doctor have him get you a referral to a Mental Health Doctor. They will give you an assessment.
mentalhealth,fn5satj,t3_fw15ry,1586674176.0,"In my opinion it is not always a serious problem. It can be a serious issue but not everyone who hear or see things are schizophrenic which is what most people jump to. I work in Mental Health and I have talked to many people and have had my own issues with the same problem. It can happen because of extreme anxiety,being tired,being manic, some people are just schizoaffective which is not schizophrenia. My son freaked out once in school he started yelling that they were all going to die because he heard nuclear bombs coming. Naturally it scared the hell out of his teacher and me. We were having him go to a counselor already though and guess what. He is just an extremely anxious boy that was watching to many youtube videos about nukes and such. He liked to study military things because his Great and regular Grandpa plus his dad had been in the military. He didn't actually hear bombs he heard the bang of a heater and his anxiety jumped right to nukes. He also saw bombs in the sky but they were clouds and etc etc. Sometime you just think you hear words or see people etc but it's something else. A normal noise that was distorted etc. Things like this happen for a lot of different reasons. So I would only really worry about it if it starts interfering with tour day to day life. Then if it's worse and you ate able too go see your doctor."

mentalhealth,fma1tif,t3_ftymoj,1585881738.0,Yep it can take awhile to find the right kinda meds I tried over 10 before I found one. However how are you doing now? Don't be to scared to call him or get get help. He is most likely just sad because he loves you. Love is a powerful thing not just between a lover but a family member or even an animal. Fight for love and fight with love. That's what I tell myself sometimes.
mentalhealth,fm9uf60,t1_fm98ky9,1585876809.0,Yes that is what I was going to say there are many other reasons it could be happening. Diffrent disorders etc etc.
mentalhealth,flzii05,t3_frqtcc,1585624486.0,"I agree don't pretend, let yourself be yourself it will help. I know it can be scary and you might feel to vulnerable or have to much pride. Sometimes you may just doubt yourself and dont want to burden others. Those kind of thoughts will try and stop you.  Even then you still have to be you. You will be surprised at the people around you that will react in a helpful caring way. If they don't then F them, be yourself for yourself."

mentalhealth,flg1vzk,t3_folchz,1585127039.0,Depends on tour insurance most people need to go to there regular doctor. Then they have that Doctor do an authorization for you to go to a counselor. Then you have to do an assessment with the counselor and then the counselor tells the Mental Health Doctor what they think you have. After being diagnosed you usually need to see a counselor and  a Mental Health Doctor that is in charge of your medications. Medical insurance has a lot to do with it. So I would go to  your GP then go from there.
mentalhealth,flegfu7,t3_fmfscq,1585083909.0,I am a Peer Support specialist now but 13 years ago I tried to jump out of a window. Now I am high functioning but I don't really know how I got to this point in life  but I did. I believe that you can too in time so try to hang in there. Even though it sounds cheesie and annoying but it can get better. I never believed that it could years ago and I hated it when people told me it does get better.I believe that mindfulness and self awareness is a very helpful tool that helped me. I hope you can find that place too. Oh and I am not rich I had to file for bankruptcy because of medical Bill's. At first I had minimal support in my life. I had only one person and they didn't understand it at all. I also don't go to therapy because I can't afford it. It will be ok in someway or another.

mentalhealth,fl5ityp,t3_fmfscq,1584837750.0,It took me years and years to be able to function and even then some days are not easy. I get through it all though and can hold down a job and many other things but it was not and never will be easy. Being successful and mentally Ill does not mean it's easy to keep being sucessful or just being ok in general. Some people are just in different places in life. Even then someone's life could be successful and good but then one episode could bring it all crashing down.
mentalhealth,fkx2qw1,t1_fkq28aq,1584616584.0,"I have been on meds for many years around 13 years. I am still considered to be in recovery. I will need them for the rest of my life. Know thinks they can recover when they are in a bad headspace. However it is possible I have helped people at work to reach recovery. Heck 10 years ago I tried to jump out a window...now look where I am. Either way I wish everybody the best. I know how hard it is and it takes many falls before things get better and that's ok. When you fall pick yourself up and try again. Never give up don't let the darkness win. Say Fook you to your head and fight. I did and I have BPD, rapid cycling Bipolar 1 with psychotic features,PTSD,Depersonalization/derealization disorder. OCD,Anxiety and panic disorder...
I'm pretty messed up but I did it I still have many issues and bad days but I have more good days now then bad."
mentalhealth,fkwwlld,t3_fl5duv,1584609068.0,That's why it is hard but all of your symptoms together are all of the symptoms of bipolar. Yes it crosses over all symptoms do. You can just have both which sucks because most of the meds for ADHD can't be taken by some body who is bipolar. I think you are on the right path though by going to see another doctor. If you can go to a Mental Health doctor. They will understand but for now there isn't much you can do. So don't Google stuff anymore and try to do something you love. You will have answers after you see someone. Hey do you get angry easily and frustrated easily every day more then once. Your depressed too right?
mentalhealth,fkww6s7,t3_fl4hec,1584608542.0,Fight don't let it win be a fighter
mentalhealth,fkwpjaz,t3_fl5duv,1584600462.0,Most SSRI's make Bipolar worse actually which might be why they seemed to make you irritated so logically speaking. you probably have Bipolar Disorder.  SSRI don't cause as many issues when you have ADHD. However some antidepressants do cause some people negative side effects and sometimes positive side effects. It all depends on the person. Also depression isn't usually a symptom of ADHD but it is a big symptom of Bipolar disorder. You do know that Mania only happens when your Bipolar not if you have ADHD? Just some things to think about because they seem like they are similar but they are also very different. I have Bipolar disorder and my husband as ADHD when I am manic we may seem similar but when you have bipolar your not always manic. So most of the time were not even close to being similar. Just something's to think about. I hope everything works out for you.
mentalhealth,fkq3f4l,t3_fjls1h,1584428897.0,"You can not recover completly from a mental illness but you can reach recovery. Recovery means that you can learn to have better days then bad. You know how to handle the bad times and get through them. You find away to get through life to survive. To enjoy those special little moments and to be ok when those dark days come. It is possible and to me self awareness of your behaviors your head and what it likes to do that you hate is important. I know when I'm having a hard day I can tell so I adjust accordingly so I can keep going. I know when I am down and when I am up. I know what I do when I'm not doing well. I know the damage I can cause I know the horrible things my head makes me think or say. I know how that hurts people that I love. I know when my head is telling me lies and when I have to fight. I know its ok to cry and to sleep to much. I know who to run to if I need help. I know the parts of me that are ugly so I can notice  when  things start. By noticing and knowing myself I can stop myself alot easier. I can adjust I know when to run and when to stay. I know my triggers and I know how to fight.
I am considered to be in recovery and because of that my job is to help others get to there version of recovery. I am a Certified Peer Support Specialist and I know things can get better I have seen it and felt it many times. There is hope."

mentalhealth,fkjtj6k,t1_firrv51,1584258999.0,"For every negative thought think of a positive thought....I hate myself...I am a kind person...I am so ugly..I really like my toes. Etc etc. Plus Try grounding tour self. For one minute be aware of your surroundings. Actively listen to the sounds around you. Touch various things and notice the texture. Identify the smells around you etc etc. It will distract your head,calm you down and make you be in the moment. Not the past, present or future but in that exact moment at that exact time. Mindfullness and self awareness are to me the keys to many of my Mental Health problems."
