depression,fbzgd7t,t3_ef7a53,1577245785.0,I lost 2019 to depression and depersonalization symptoms. Im trying to make the best out of life but every day feels like a battle. I hope 2020 regardless gives us good things. We can do it.

dpdr,fbpw6x0,t1_fbpofve,1577025660.0,"i know, though i get the feeling that if one dwells every moment on feeling like you go autopilot, you'll burden your head a lot more than you actually should. I know its a bit like letting your boat go down a waterfall, but maybe we should follow the flow? And eventually we can trick our brain into thinking we truly have control over whats going on."
dpdr,fbpi2j5,t1_fbp8tuc,1577021257.0,"Thank you man. At first, i took this hard. I ended up bedridden an entire week just staring blankly. I was terrified this would go on forever, and to some degree i still am. I still zone out a lot due to hating the sensation of derealization, but ive also noticed that if i immerse myself enough into something it kind of decreases in intensity eventually. Or i forget but it comes back. 

However, like you said, often i get scared of how blank my mind is, and how i cannot get my prior to this vivid imagination to work again. I try to think/speak loudly to comfort myself, but interal monologue is still a struggle since i think so many bad thoughts. I also tried sharing my thoughts and while my parents tried to understand, i know they just arent getting it. 

You're not alone either! I get times where my mind has a hard time comprehending it, but im not the only one feeling this way. I hope things get better for you too!"

At times, my own voice and the things i say sound unfamiliar even though im obviously replying in a sense that shows i understood what someone said."
dpdr,fborr3f,t3_eds3dr,1577013646.0,"i remember being stuck with the flu at the same time as this 2 weeks ago and it was a living hell. Constantly drifting in and out of the darkness scared me like nothing else. My empathy goes out to you OP.

I know you may not think its possible but you can do it."
