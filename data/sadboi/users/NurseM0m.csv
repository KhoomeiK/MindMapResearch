Nurse,fqniln4,t3_gjntbt,1589495505.0,"Very normal feelings for a new nurse. To some degree you won’t get the “full experience” and bulk of your learning until you’re on your own. You have to sort of decide how to make your practice your own. I would hope your floor would be supportive and keep an eye on you if you’re clearly drowning. But preceptorship is really just to lay some solid groundwork and make sure you’re not gonna be negligent/kill someone. I don’t expect my new grads to be completely proficient when they come off, just competent enough to mostly handle their patient load, know where their resources are and how to identify a patient in obvious trouble. Ask lots of questions! Keep a notebook to jot things down that you can look up later when you have time or on your off days. I think techs have a hard time thinking they need to do it all- learn to delegate appropriate tasks to your techs. You can’t do it all! 

If you really feel unsafe ask for more time but these are very normal feelings for a new nurse."

After 6 years and about to be on my 3rd cloth baby here is what personally has worked well for us:



Newborn: invest in a newborn stash, they hold resale value well and most babies will not fit right into OS without it being rly bulky. We loved prefolds or workhorses from Green Mountain Diapers and Nickis newborn covers or Thirsties Duo wraps in size 1 (both of these covers actually fit much longer than just the newborn stage, the duos fit well into 4 or 5 months even on my chunkier baby). We did not like rumparooz newborn covers, we didn’t like any of the newborn all in one diapers (bumgenius, Grovia, lil Joeys, China cheapies) we tried bc they were not absorbent enough with the exception of kawaii nb bamboo pockets and nickis nb bamboo aio. 


OS: there are very few brands we haven’t tried so if you have any questions about a specific brand I’m happy to answer. Everyone will have a different experience but again for us personally after all these years the following are our favorites when considering absorbency, fit, durability and price. Nickis bamboo AIO, nickis ultimate AIO, Kawaii heavy wetter pocket, GMD prefolds, nickis/thirsties duo/imagine brand covers, best bottom with the snap in inserts or as a cover over a prefold. 


For cloth wipes we used Yatsa Crafting off Etsy for our last and they held up amazingly well, I got a few Grovia wipes to try this time too. We just filled the peri bottle they give you at the hospital with warm water and a few drops of wipes solution (cjs carcass cleaner or lusa) and gave each wipe a little squirt before use. 


Hopefully this isn’t too much of an info overload!"

I didn’t really have to “train” either of them I think in part bc they have always felt wet/dirty since they wore cloth. In the beginning when we were going out I would just put a pocket diaper on but make the snaps kind of loose so they could pull them up and down. For my son he wasn’t ready until a month before he turned 3, my daughter decided she was ready right after turning 2. 

For nighttime my daughter now 3.5 still has accidents so we use a motherease fitted (side snapping fitted so she can pull it up and down) with a wool soaker."

I would just do a bleach soak in the washing machine followed by a regular old wash/rinse. Let em dry and start using them! If you notice issues then investigate further.

You don’t have to have it all figured out perfect before you start. Sometimes I would change my absorbency/inserts from change to change just to see what works, that’s the great part about cloth being so customizable.

As for out and about, it’s really no different than disposables. You put the dirty wipes (we used cloth wipes too) and diaper in the wet bag and add it to the pail when you get home. If there was a big solid poo I would just dump it in the toilet on the way out of the bathroom/changing area. Ebf poo just went in the wet bag dirty.

Storage wise, mine are just in a pile on our changing table shelf, truly no organization lol. And our pail is a small trash can with a pail liner in the bathroom. 

I say just start one day and if you don’t like it you can always switch right back. It’s not all or nothing."

Math we use life of Fred which reads like a story book and so far he loves. We supplement with other random math books like Bedtime Math or math board games because he enjoys it. 
We read a lot of books and play A LOT.
Science and history are loose and interest led. He has a  real microscope with about 100 slides that he loves and plays with almost daily and we have a large home library with lots of science books he frequently asks me to read to him. I work in a medical field so he likes to asks questions about my day at work or play with spare equipment in my bag. 
History usually comes in the form of questions about things, or pointing to somewhere on the world map and asking to learn about it.

I don’t have a yearly plan, I have sort of a loose idea of where I want to be by the end of the year, which I openly share with him and I’m trying to show how daily study habits and time management can help you get to your goals."
HomeschoolRecovery,ezuhvzf,t3_d28n47,1568152578.0,"I see a lot of replies citing difficulties with socialization. Is there anything you feel could’ve been provided to you that may have contributed to a more positive experience? For example, mainstream (normal rec league) sports, co-op classes, mom or dad making play dates with friends’ public schooled kids? 

(I really do want to be aware of the possible negative consequences of the decision to homeschool)"

clothdiaps,ey34tz2,t3_cvajsz,1566755394.0,Prefolds and covers with a viva paper towel as a liner to catch the bulk of the poo. Toss the liner/poo and hand wash the prefolds in a bucket (even if they’re not totally clean  to wear again jsut to get them somewhat clean so they don’t stink so bad)
clothdiaps,ex01v3c,t3_cqsqd0,1565903752.0,"Looks good :)
I would recommend some more prefolds and covers for the newbie days because they’re so easy to wash. And definitely look into cloth wipes! It makes the whole process go much easier bc you don’t have to separate out the wipes to the trash"

clothdiaps,et6dhrw,t3_ca5oy4,1562510255.0,"Currently preparing for cloth baby #3 (collective 5 years of cloth in our house!) I’ve used almost every style/combo and here’s a list of my tried and true favorites:

Newborn:
-Kawaii newborn bamboo (I think it’s called mom label sometimes) pocket diapers 

-green mountain diaper newborn prefolds with a best bottom cover or thirsties size 1 cover

-green mountain diaper newborn snapless fitted with a sweet pea newborn cover

-nickis diapers newborn ultimate aio 

One size days:
-kawaii heavy wetter pocket diaper

-prefold with best bottoms, thirsties, or nickis os 
diaper cover (daddy liked to pad fold the prefolds)

-best bottoms used as a AI2 (Snap insert) for daddy

-nickis diapers bamboo aio 

-hybrid fitted with no cover/pants for lazy days

One size nights:
-tots bots bamboozle stretch fitted with a nickis os cover

-nickis overnight bamboo fitted with wool

-sustainablebabyish overnight bamboo fitted with wool or cover

-one size up prefold, bamboo insert laid in a cover over top 

(I would use various combos of the above with relative success save for those occasional floods that no diaper can contain)

There are definitely a lot of the same products but I’ve found over the years that they’re made very well and gave us the best combo of affordability and functionality, but we have tried most major brands/styles and many different retailers."
ibs,esj7m9b,t1_esj5wre,1562027590.0,I use it in the morning after breakfast. I just use a spoonful once a day. You can do up to 3 times daily but one seems to be working right now

ibs,erakq9p,t3_c11601,1560646595.0,I was prescribed bentyl by my GI and that really helped. It also helped decrease my anxiety around going out because I knew I had something to take.
aspergirls,eqt22ls,t1_eqso1hc,1560300024.0,I was not good at explaining. I would find articles or blog posts or stuff that I would send him to help explain for me. And he did some reading and learning on his own too.
aspergirls,eqsdswd,t3_bzeh3g,1560282598.0,"I don’t know if I could accept a partner who wasn’t supportive of my needs. And it sounds like he doesn’t understand that medication is a need for you, he seems to be treating it like some optional thing. 
My husband needed a lot of time to understand why I am the way I am (still not officially diagnosed and am referring mostly to mental health issues in general), but now he is supportive and helpful"
homeschool,epdri1i,t1_epdpjy2,1559172305.0,"He LOVES when I read to him and he wants to read a very wide variety of books including some dense nonfiction picture encyclopedias about space, rocks and minerals, etc. so I am very thankful for that. I certainly don’t want to squash his enjoyment.
His reading comprehension I think is pretty good, he understands sequence of events, character traits, he can recount what happened and make guesses as to why or what happens next. But when it’s his turn to read he’s minimally engaged. And writing is just a fight unless it’s copywork. 

More than anything, it seems I probably just needed some reassurance from other homeschoolers that I’m not failing my kid lol"
homeschool,epdh4gd,t1_epda3hj,1559166110.0,"He did have a comprehensive hearing screening at a pediatric audiologist when he was not speaking by age 2 and everything was normal.

He does definitely have a tongue tie but I’m not sure how much that might affect his speech? His little sister had a laser frenectomy done on hers because she could feed well but he never had feeding issues so we didn’t get his fixed and his dentist has never even mentioned it. 

The only thing he hasn’t had is an eye exam which may affect his ability to see words but obviously has nothing to do with his speech. So I’ll at least try to get that done."
homeschool,epd2uvl,t1_epd03sz,1559161356.0,"I have read that! I consider myself pretty open minded, and so I guess I never thought it would be so hard to change my thinking about schooling."
homeschool,epcur7o,t1_epc35pr,1559158686.0,"His first experience In speech therapy was when he was 2 because he wouldn’t talk. We did so some signing which he did well with but they put him in a group setting to encourage him to talk more. 

Then he was evaluated again when he went to pre-k. They didn’t specify a specific disorder, just that he was hard for the teacher and other kids to understand because he would drop syllables and has difficulty with hard k, v, s/th. He seems to be more easily understood now but still has a lisp."
homeschool,epctpd2,t1_epbrzby,1559158336.0,I have only started noticing it since we started doing more reading. I am not quite sure how to seek an evaluation? His pediatrician? His speech therapy he did in pre-k was done through the school since he did go to pre-K at public school.
homeschool,epct701,t1_epbd2j6,1559158163.0,Thank you. I have read so many studies that all agree public school is pushing reading too early. Even medical/academic journals I have access to because of my profession. The words of encouragement mean a lot because it’s so hard to not compare and accept that we are going down a completely different path in terms of pacing.

homeschool,epb8hq8,t1_epb7gbh,1559139208.0,I agree! That was one of the reasons I actually chose to homeschool. I thought he needed more free play and exploration. I just never expected how hard that would actually be for me as a parent to go against the grain.
