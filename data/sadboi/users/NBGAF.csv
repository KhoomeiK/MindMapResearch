If you feel like you have to do something and have no desire to actually do it then why bother? A lot of things take an aggressive sense of purpose to do. But for most people this drive is innate so as an SPD it seems like just a thankless task.

If you're content then what's the problem? Unless you actively want friends, why bother? What is the benefit? Are you trying to alievate loneliness or build connection? Personally I've never felt more alone than when I'm around others.

ASPD is Cluster B. 

They're drastically different catergories.

Also there is a difference between Anti-social and Asocial. ASPD people lack empathy and don't just do things because they are bored but because they can and can get away with it. An SPD person basically doesn't give a fuck. It is annoying because people don't understand not wanting or caring to be around people is not anti-social. It is Asocial.

&#x200B;

 **The Schizoid Personality Disorder\*** is characterized by a pervasive pattern of **social detachment** and a **restricted range of emotional expression**.  For these reasons, people with this disorder tend to be socially  isolated. They don't seem to seek out or enjoy close relationships.

&#x200B;

* They almost always chose solitary activities, and seem to take little pleasure in life.
*  Antisocial, especially in  reference to the personality disorder, refers to someone with certain  traits that fall under the general description â€˜a pervasive pattern of  disregard for and violation of the rights of othersâ€™. 
* Asocial would not bother because they are just not interested in others. They lack the superficial charm that an ASPD would develop. 
*  Antisocial is someone who is  unable to conform norms of society, while asocial is someone who is  isolated and withdrawn from society.

 One doesnâ€™t care about others. The other avoids others. 

Schizoid personality disorder is  associated with decreased drive for social relationships and a deep  involvement in fantasizing alone. 

ASPD is associated with lack morals,  lack of remorse, callousness, irritability, impulsiveness and frequent  lying.
