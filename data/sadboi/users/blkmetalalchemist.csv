depression,f1ord28,t1_f1oqzt9,1569658949.0,"Oh. I know burdens and depression with the best of them. I'm not saying your statements aren't true. But it is what it is and it will be what it is. What you do with it is what matters. I could easily be a madman, and would love to be so. But I'm also a 6%er academic with a stable moral compass. Without that I'd match heaths joker... Just irl. You need to know you, when you fall into depression and mental illnesses of the like. I am diagnosed with MDD and have done two stints in state mental facilities. I know my limits before I become a danger. But to each their own. Everyones MH journey will be different. How you handle it will be different. Because none of us are the same. I don't know what you wwrw insinuating and I don't care to know. But look inside before you look outwards. Many of you seem to not even know yourselves, with due respect. I'm not here to please anyone. Just share my experience and subsequent thoughts. No need to be defensive.  I take 40mg of Paxil, 150mg Welbutrin, 100mg of Visteral every 4hrs and benadryl to sleep. I am better than none. Just got out of state hospital a little over a month ago."

What one won't, there's a hundred other that will. I don't mean to demean. But be real with yourself. It's not the end of the world. As joker would say... ""Why so serious?"""
depression,f1ojpqt,t3_czadw0,1569648280.0,He'll fucking no. Take this shit away as fast as possible. At 23 I'll never get to see a full life the way our planet is going anyways. Do what you must for you. And that will differ from person to person. I know where I stand.

Many factors play into this. I'm top 6% IQ Binet tested and I know if I don't take myself out. I'll take others. Out of the fact I'm a sheer sadistic psychopath. My wife has chosen to stand by me. I'll never know why. Genius or insane I say."

college,f0qskog,t3_d607jv,1568865597.0,"Dedicate, try your best and cross your fingers. It all depends on your major really. Put in that extra effort. The professors will see that no doubt. They may seem like hard asses but they are no different than me and you pursuing what they have. In orser to do this, you will have to have soft skills in which many don't. Make yourself stand out one way or another. Abd if not cees get degrees too. Best of luck to you"

college,f0qqa87,t1_f0qphcv,1568864296.0,"It's like a late register. Reach out to said professor and ask them if they will override into their course, and although you are behind, assure them you will catch up. More than likely they will override you into their fully booked class. Just be honest with your situation, nobody likes a liar. It's not respectable. And more likely than not the professor will cut you some slack to catch up. I'm going through this right now, but I also have built quite the rapport on my campus. Just do not make up some story because they will see right through you. I wish you the best in your studies. It's week four now."
