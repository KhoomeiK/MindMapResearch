AskAnAmerican,fqafz71,t1_fqabol6,1589218419.0,"Anyway, imma try and summary it. So... First of all, Uzbekistan is a central Asian Country that was under the soviets, Estonia is a fino ugric country in the baltics who was oppressed by the russians, Slovakia is a western slavic country who was never under direct sovietic rule. So regarding ""Why are there so many countries"", in Europe (more specifically eastern Europe) there are maaaany cultures and languages, starting with :



Slavs :
 
ex yugoslav countries--Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia (the only Muslim slavs) Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia (They are slavs, not greeks.)

Southern slavs--ex yugoslavs and Bulgaria (worth to note, Northern Macedonians are more bulgarian than serbian/Greek)

Western slavs--Poland, Czechia and Slovakia (czechia and Slovakia were up until the 90s Czechoslovakia, they separated from each other). Worth to note, these 3, Slovenia and Croatia don't use the Cyrillic alphabet.

Eastern slavs-- Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Belarus and Ukraine were oppressed by the russians for centuries.



Finno-Ugrics:

Hungary, Estonia, Finland (came from around the urals in the 800s). Estonia was part of the soviet union and Finland was under Russian-Swedish rule for centuries (not sovietic rule though) 



Others in Eastern Europe:

Latins--Romania (where I'm from) 

Balkaners (the geographic location)--Albanians (ilirians who are mostly Muslims), greeks, turks (only because of Thrace) 

Baltics--Lithuania, Latvia (these were under soviet rule like Estonia - basically sister countries) 




Now, having that covered, under soviet rule were:

Russia (where Lenins revolution started), Ukraine, Belarus, the baltics (Estonia Lithuania Latvia), all of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan etc)and Bessarabia (a romanian region more or less stolen by the russians, doesnt matter all that much) (aaand the Caucasus countries, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan) 

Under soviet influence (or Warsaw pact):

Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia (when it was a country), Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, east Germany 



A very quick ""history of eastern europe"" :

Indo Europeans (including India and Persia), Greek civilizations and thracian tribes (ilirian aka albanians and dacians aka romanians), romans conquered most of europe, slavic and other people (Fino ugrics, Mongols) come in the between the 400s and 1300s, ottoman empire defeats the Byzantines, and thus conquers the balkans (that s why most bosniaks are Muslims), Russian domination up until the 1800s, states gain independence (except for Ukraine, Belarus etc), Ww1, Ww2, and here we are today"
