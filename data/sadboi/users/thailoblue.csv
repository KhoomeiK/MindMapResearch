Companies can also still prohibit you because at the federal level it is still illegal. DEA could arrest you for smoking a joint in Colorado. So companies that operate outside one state are more likely to prohibit it and have legal grounds. While states legalizing helps more people, it needs to also change at the federal level, which seems to be an inevitability, for interstate companies to be ok with you using it safely."

That’s not even close to true. Legion was by one of the most popular expansions. It had it’s rough edges as all expansions do, but was very well received.

That’s kind of an unfair comparison though. It’s like saying Vanilla had more success therefore it’s better.

The main objective of expansion specific features though is to provide end game progression past the level cap. So by that very nature, some times it’s gonna suck. Which pushes players to find ways to get ahead. Either through force or workarounds. No class or spec is perfect and plenty of people change classes because their preferred gameplay was changed or removed. That’s kind of the nature of MMO’s.
