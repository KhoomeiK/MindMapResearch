BernieSanders,fjpp7yd,t1_fjpjrj8,1583557115.0,"Absolutely -- and fair point. Ending voter supression and giving everyone a voice in the political process is one of the main reasons I align with and support Sanders!

To be clear, my post was focused on those who are able to vote, have every opportunity to vote, have accessible polling locations, yet don't show up to the polls for, let's say, a less-than-genuine reason like ""my one vote doesn't even matter"". That's a real quote from someone I know for which I couldn't even muster a response."

unpopularopinion,fjp66hx,t1_fjox1vg,1583542805.0,"Thank you for taking the time to state that!! I wanted to but... ugh, to argue with redditors. The analogy is bad and his response is to attack your ""debate skills"" without an explanation.

I'm probably gonna end up deleting this later, but now that I'm already typing, allow me to further respond to the ""moocher"" argument:

The fact that most people wouldn't want 10 strangers in their living room, worthy of help or not, is why government programs are important for those in need. You don't know if the ""moocher"" is a moocher, or someone with cognitive disabilities, or a former veteran with PTSD, or someone with mental health issues and needs that simply weren't being met. And that's ok because you're likely not trained and licensed to recognize and know such things. But you know who can set up an infrastructure to help those folks and assess their needs? You guessed it -- assistance programs. And if 9 people can successfully get off assistance programs but 1 person fails to do so, these programs often try to clinically diagnose why the failure occurred and how to provide alternative support. As opposed to, you know, getting upset that someone is mooching off you.

So, yes, it's a bad analogy. It does contain a false equivelence. And although I understand the point and why it was made, the comment itself is exactly why professionals working for nonprofit programs are necessary and the burden, for lack of a better term, is passed on via taxes as opposed to assigning strangers to everyone's living room.

There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

ABoringDystopia,fhqc8x7,t3_f3dvz5,1581802164.0,"Why are we confusing net worth with annual income? A lot of folks have a net worth lower than their annual income (because most of their income is non-disposable and goes to things like rent, food, and transportation as opposed to savings and investments). If my income is $60k but I only have $20k saved and/or invested, then the Jeff Bezos analogy is more like spending only $25 to buy the biggest, most luxurious property in all of LA.

Edit: to be clear, I'm not trying to pick on semantics here. I'm just saying that Bezos spent even LESS for this purchase when using actual net worth for the comparison."
