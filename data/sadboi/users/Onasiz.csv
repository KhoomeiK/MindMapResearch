Petloss,fct9x5s,t3_eipcd1,1577936830.0,"I started volunteering with a rescue after my dog passed away. It‚Äôs my pay it forward. It was hard at times but it helped. It also made me realize by getting a new dog of the same breed, it would never be her. So I think it also helped me not try to replace her in that way. Check out local rescues or a humane society type thing, they usually need volunteers. 
If you decide to- it will be hard sometimes. Everyone heals differently though, this is just what helped me.
I‚Äôm so very sorry for your loss."
