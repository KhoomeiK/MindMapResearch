And I mean ALL contact. That way you won't have to deal with their toxicity, and (hopefully) they'll come to their senses and realize that what they've been putting you through was really sucky of them, and will actually want to create a healthy relationship with you. But even if this doesn't happen, don't let it get to you. Just know that you are better than them. And I'm sorry that you're going through this. My mom also had a sucky, abusive home life, and she started suffering from anorexia because of this as well. Please confide in your school counselors about this, but if they're sucky, confide in someone you trust and who will listen to you. And please stay strong, I know that times are hard for you right now, but staying strong will help you!"

And, while I'm noy saying you have PTSD, the trauma you've been through, even though you don't remember them or it, could be playing a part in this.

Also, whenever my disorders are getting to me, I draw or make art in general about it. It doesn't matter whether or not you're a good drawer, as long as you're expressing your feelings. You don't have to show anyone this art (unless you want to, but it can be basically a diary).
