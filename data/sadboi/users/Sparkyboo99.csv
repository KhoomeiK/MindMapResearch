Advice I have in the early days- can you change up your environment, work from a coffee shop or library, just for short term while you detox to get out of your house where you used to smoke during day and away from other smokers.  Get plenty of exercise.   Change up habits around your prior smoking behaviors ... ie if you used to smoke on your lunch breaks, take a walk instead.  Eat well but treat yourself if you need to."

DatingAfterThirty,fa0wpzk,t3_e7fane,1575761366.0,"The way I am trying to approach it is, dating apps are for finding interesting people to meet, in person. I used to spend more time getting to know someone over text with a lot of back and forth before meeting, getting to know each other via text. Now I still do some of that - but my main goal is to meet people face to face -before revealing my whole life story or getting his. 

Plenty of guys seem to be more comfortable texting and don‚Äôt want to make the effort to meet. There is no point (to me) in spending my precious time getting to know someone online, investing emotional energy and revealing personal details about myself to someone who I never end up meeting IRL.  Be safe and protect yourself !  You can‚Äôt truly know who is behind the other screen until you meet in the flesh.  And even then there is still much to learn about another person.

I have my friends to text with, I‚Äôm not on bumble to make virtual text friends. If the first coffee date can‚Äôt be set up soon- then I move on."
