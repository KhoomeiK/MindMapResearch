Chriswatts,fqzp0u7,t1_fqzoqzy,1589772110.0,Good points. I’m sure he would follow his father’s examples. He’s a moron just like his father too. They both had to be told what to do. The whole family makes me sick!

One day, I couldn’t take it anymore, and went through his phone and that’s when I found out he was cheating on me right, left and sideways. I wish I would’ve gotten out sooner.

I’m an Identical Twin and Twins have complicated relationships. You DO NOT put yourself in the middle of Twins and give your opinion. Let them hash it out. Besides that, no one wants to feel like everyone in the room is ganging up on you, especially if one of those people is your significant other. 
And I agree about telling her if they went to Grand Canaria, he probably would have proposed. He knew that she is desperate for a proposal and telling her that would cut her to the core. Just like asking her if she put on weight. Both comments were intentionally vindictive."
90DayFiance,fmt4s69,t1_fmssky0,1586366862.0,"Thanks for the update. I noticed that yesterday. I’m sure he tried to get Amazon to do something about those negative reviews as he threatened to sue the reviewers. They probably told him he had no case. They probably took down the page completely to shut him up. He doesn’t understand that reviews are opinions and therefore cannot be construed as defamation, as he called it. He portrays himself as a kind humanitarian but nothing can be farther from the truth. I’m sure he loathed having those reviews there as they offended his huge ego"
90DayFiance,fmpy1s9,t1_fmppto2,1586289400.0,"Exactly! As you said before, he probably called some lawyers and they told him he had no case and laughed at him as soon as they hung up the phone. After that, he probably tried to get Amazon to do something, and all they did was take down the page. Probably just to shut him up. He couldn't erase those reviews like he does with the comments he doesn't like on Instagram. Given his over-inflated ego, each review was probably excruciating to him. 

He needs to get a clue. And put some clothes on!"

90DayFiance,fmoohzf,t1_fmnyqdb,1586264912.0,"He tried to bully people into deleting their reviews. And it worked to a degree because some did. But when there were still at least 15 bad reviews, he stopped selling it on Amazon and is only selling it on his page now. But that still wasn’t good enough. Because the reviews were still there and people could see them. It probably ate away at him and he got Amazon to take down the page completely. Nothing comes up when you search for it on Amazon now. I guess he didn’t know that his dumb book was available for digital download for free on Kindle up until the other day. So he’s telling the truth when he says that no one has bought the book, but he has no way of knowing if anyone has read it or not. 

I’m sure he spent most of yesterday trying to get Amazon to do something about the people who left the reviews and they said that all they can do is take down the page. Any negative talk out there about him really upsets him. He likes to portray a person that isn’t bothered by that, but he really is, and extremely so. 

Amazon has so much going on with limited staff and trying to get things to people who are home-bound, but let them take time to take care of this crybaby’s problem. Bad reviews....boo-hoo!"
