BPD,foq5ri5,t3_g8x56b,1587984003.0,"Hi OP, I am recovered from BPD and I also have bipolar 1 disorder. I'm just here to validate your feelings about how you have been treated by mental health professionals. 

When I was at the point in my life where I met criteria for BPD, I had more than ten (I lost count) hospitalizations related to the disorder.  My experience in the hospital was that doctors and nurses didn't take me seriously, especially my suicidal ideation, and I was made to feel like a nuisance.  

Now I'm older (36) and recovered from BPD but have still had many hospitalizations for my bipolar disorder, mostly over the last year.  Let me tell you, the difference in how you are treated as a bipolar patient and a BPD patient is night and day.  I was taken soo seriously by the doctors.  At one point I expressed suicidal ideation and they moved me to a different room on the ward, away from the exit.  I was never taken so seriously as a borderline with suicidal ideation, not at all.

So basically, from my subjective experience, you're totally right that BPD is not taken as seriously by doctors as other illnesses.  

I do feel the need though to explain that many people with bipolar disorder struggle for decades to find the right medication regiment.  I have had psychotic symptoms for the last year and a half and I am yet to take a medication that helps. So, sometimes bipolar can be more complicated than just taking your meds. 

Seriously though, you're not wrong.  I'm sorry you've had such bad experiences with mental health professionals.  The stigma is so real."
