depression,fp0c379,t1_fox58fn,1588206403.0,"In a few months. I don't know if it's a 30 year old crisis or something, but I've lived my life in a way completely reckless because I was living off gambling for so long that I sort of lost connection to the everyday obligations others have gone through.

Now since things have changed, due to me starting to abuse alcohol & taking pills, getting older. I'm not even accustomed to that everyday life people deal with & I feel disconnected from it."

depression,foxahuv,t1_fox58fn,1588138286.0,"What is an adult though & for what reasons &  when do you become one? I've always felt like this. I provide for myself if that's the criteria. I've gotten older & I'm still the same in this regard.

Completely genuine question though. I'll have a a few good days & a hell for months where I want to do nothing & at times I just wonder what keeps me going the distance if the bad outweigh the good. Especially when I know these periods will return which also makes me feel like a tool cus during those periods I don't treat people that do care well & I feel like I come around as self-centered so I just disappear which also makes me feel selfish.

Then when all I've heard is why are you doing this to yourself when you've got this, that & bla bla while on the inside I contiounsly feel like shit & don't get a single ounce of joy out of anything anymore.

I've also had issues with OCD from an early age.

As a sidenote I'm not allowed to take anti-depressants since I overdosed om drugs before & I'm opposed to it either way."
