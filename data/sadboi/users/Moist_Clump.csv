It's ok to not like it totally, or not be excited by not toking. And it does have more benefits than downsides.

Tolerance is drops - which is good coz i do like just fucking my shit up proper on occasion

You do gain a clarity that makes some things easier - concentration/memory definitely.

And then you have something to look forward to, rather than it becoming a bit stagnant.

I still smoke everyday and weekends are free game! Just good to have that balance in place now :)

I'll probably try to keep a week off every month going forward! And I suggest not necessarily the same but finding what helps you balance :)"

Im so sorry it's torturing you. But it's not your fault, no matter what your age. It's a bunch of chemicals being a bunch of dicks and you don't deserve it... But you can kick its arse. 

You'll get through this just like the last panic attack.

It's YOUR birthday, do what you want and anyone who gets in the way can go play in traffic.

Happy Birthday!!! Take a breath, have some cake, dust yourself off, you're going to be alright :)"

Be kind to yourself. It was one of the puzzle pieces, but not the entire puzzle.

You've got a long road a head no denying. So, take some time go and do things you weren't able to do before. Find yourself again. It's terrifying. I know. But I believe in you. 

You are important. Incredibly important."
SeriousConversation,f785ss3,t3_duosi2,1573485962.0,"Year from absolute hell.

Moved in with my mother to help her financially, only for her narcisstic personality to shine through, and become emotionally abusive towards myself, my partner and her 7 year old son, as well as my younger brother.

Through this, became depressed and anxious. Struggled to continue at my job, which I admit was horrible. But caused a cascade affect of debts to build up.

Moved out and lived with a friend for a month who housed my family. Found a house and a new job.

Mother continued her antics, dragging friends in and using them as conduits to contact me. Sold my car as it was in her name despite it originally being a gift. Then claimed I dumped it on her. Rocked up at my girlfriends father's place of work and vented to the cashier about all her issues saying her sons abandoned her. And she won't let me see my dog. 

My step sister whom I'm very close too ended up in the psych ward due to sucidial tendancies.

Im in a band which got offered a tour to Europe but I can't afford to go.

My step son had a trip to the hospital as well due to an infected tooth. 

Im behind in rent and most of my bills. They have been semi sorted but today.... I lost my new job. I admit I had some time off due to health issues (the depression/anxiety, but I also suffer from urticaria and psoriasis which has surfaced for the first time in 13 years due to stress). However they claimed that wasn't the reason and my quality was the problem. Despite taking the most amount of calls my first month there by 300% of the average, with 9 rejected calls. For comparison, one of the other engineers bounced 189 for the month. 

I wasn't perfect by any stretch. I was still learning a job where documentation was practically ethereal and support was next to none. 

I don't know how much more I can take. I hate my field. I work in IT in managed services and despise it. The constant expectation and horrible treatment by those who are more entitled was soul shattering. Being treated and spoken to like shit for not knowing someone's full DNA profile from a simple ""my emails won't work"" message.

I don't know what to do to be honest.

What would make me feel better? Honestly, a fresh start financially. I've got 2 weeks til the little ones birthday and if i let him down I'll hate myself.

What would I tell someone in my situation?
That fucking sucks a plethora for flaccid willy.

Theres more smaller things that have worn me down in the middle of all this, but.. It's 2:30am.

Cheers for reading."

I also would like to know, is there actually such a thing as 'up'. The idea of being on the same plane is awesome. But as stated in the comments, some are on tilt I believe? Where do you measure the tilt from?

Following on from that, can the sun appear to us as ""upside down"", such as a clock face with the 6 up top and 12 down the bottom? 

Or is it all just relative and I should sleep?"
