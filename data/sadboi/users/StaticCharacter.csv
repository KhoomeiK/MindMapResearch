Shes just a worrywart about everything lol. Also we have played with the idea of her bringing a 3rd home for funsies, if that's not tmi. 

She worries more that she will in the future regret not spending her time doing the whole young person freedom thing, or that I'll eventually think her lack of experience in relationships is a bad thing. While neither of us struggle with it really now, and I doubt it will be a problem in the future, she worries over every possibility.

Really I don't know if my goal is to end homelessness and I will need to do more research for sure before I make anything happen. This post is part of the process. But in my own experience I'd disagree that ""panhandling"" or begging isnt a good way to raise funds. I mean I wouldnt call it traditional begging, but I've been a fund raiser for large non-profits for some time now, specifically ""Fund for the Public Interest"" and nearly all their political power comes from contributions that door to door people like myself generate. Though that's just what I know and I'm always open to other ideas on how to generate funds to move ideas.

The idea going door to door is more than just gaining funds though. Primarily it is uniting a community, bringing awareness to the idea I have, and giving truth to saying we are stronger together. I think a united community is a powerful thing, and seeing the impact it could have on individuals that have found themselves in difficult spots might be just the thing to bring them together.
