I hope you can talk to someone and at least vent, for me going outside and just basking in the fresh air and sunlight clears my mind of all problems, maybe you can try it out. Watching a new show or movie, some anime or playing a video game helps me out, sorry if they're common things. I wish you the best of luck and stay safe."

I don't have all the answers but right now I try to focus on myself and don't think about people at all. What helps me is to go outside and skate for a couple hours, go to the park or other locations around me. For me its something that I now look forward to everyday and keeps me ok. Try to find something that'll keep you occupied, I know thats a very vague thing but it helped me and hopefully it can help you. If you ever need a friend please feel to message me, I've met nice people on here who are always here to help. Stay safe."
