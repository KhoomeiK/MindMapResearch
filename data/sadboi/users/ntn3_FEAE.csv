AskReddit,fn85gm1,t3_fzzt1r,1586734306.0,"Jeremy Wade Delle, the 15-year old who committed suicide and inspired Pearl Jam to write ""Jeremy"". He probably felt the loneliest up to when he shot himself, so coming back to posthumous fame thanks to the song would be overwhelming."
hockey,fkpggdn,t3_fjq6ik,1584409574.0,"IIRC we used the song as Henrik Zetterberg's goal song (and the crowd would shout ""Hank!"" instead of ""Hey!""), but I don't know when it started and for how long it was used until Z's LTIRetirement."
DetroitRedWings,fkfp9s5,t1_fkc77dk,1584139507.0,"Glad you included that 12/6/14 NYR game, pretty underrated IMO. That was when we faced consecutive 5-on-3s for what seemed like forever in the 3rd. I still wonder why Martin St. Louis insisted on that weird angle shot on a 5-on-3, but whatever, it was tense and I had the biggest sigh of relief when the game ended."
DetroitRedWings,fkfoo1l,t1_fkc6mdc,1584139122.0,"This game was my first thought upon reading the topic title. It had it all: a Shea Weber hat-trick only for him to cost the Preds the game in the final play by not covering Kronwall; rookie Larkin's solo effort on the 3rd goal; Ryan Ellis' boneheaded revenge play on Helm leading to the game-tying PP goal by the Wings (featuring Abdelkader's ""AHHHHHH!!!"" in the in-game mic); and the best 3-on-3 OT ever. It even had Mickey Redmond singing Piano Man! And Tatar shoves people out of the way in the post-game celebration to haul down Nyquist and hug him! Amazing game all around."
residentevil,fimkisf,t3_f8n5w1,1582534385.0,"Fantastic game! I spent a lot of hours grinding it out in Raid Mode across two platforms (PS Vita and PC), and I'm looking forward to a 3rd when I buy it on the Switch. Moira's character development was pretty intriguing as well."
AskReddit,fijhaz6,t3_f80qhl,1582447921.0,"My former best friend at work was a guy I met when we were both at crossroads in our lives, and we helped each other make decisions that led to us quitting the company and pursuing something more. He was a religious man and I an atheist, but we kept religion off the table when we talked, and always proceeded along reasonable tangents when we did discuss religion out of respect for each others' different beliefs.

The last time we met to catch up (with him now in a different job and me in law school), he effectively started and ended the conversation talking up his religion, and 90% of the conversation was about it or inexplicably lead to it. I went along with it since I really wanted to catch up with him and I loved him as a friend but in the end, I realized that for about 5+ hours I essentially sat through an indoctrination process, complete with an opening and ending prayer. It was pretty exhausting and somewhat disappointing, and a really far cry from the kind of stuff we did when we were workmates. I haven't met with him since."
AskReddit,fijfaao,t3_f7yk11,1582445343.0,"In my first law school, I met a good friend who was older than most of the batch, at 25 years of age (average age is 20-21). He was perfectly healthy guy, save for some weird blotches on some parts of his face. He liked to justify his weirder, riskier ideas by saying: ""It's okay, I'm not going to live past 30."" It felt more like sarcasm on his part, consistent with his easygoing personality.

A year later, he was diagnosed with skin cancer. A year and a half after that, he passed away from it at 27, a few weeks shy of his 28th birthday. It turns out his statement wasn't so much dark humor as it was an accurate premonition of his."
katawashoujo,fhxroih,t3_f4zpln,1581960849.0,"This was my phone and laptop wallpaper (because Hanako is the best, and this is the best art of her) during the time I was going through the worst of my depression years ago, and KS helped so much in keeping me stable during that time. I'll always be fond of this art for that."
SquaredCircle,ffyx32z,t3_evyd27,1580357332.0,"Wasn't sold on Taichi with the Moi Dix Mois shtick until he won the GHC Junior Heavyweight title in 2015 and started disrespecting that belt (similar to Naito in his first IC reign but not nearly as destructive). He became one of my low-key favorites then, and has now become my favorite NJPW wrestler once he moved to heavyweight and started channeling Kawada in matches."
AskReddit,ffk7t2t,t3_ett7fr,1580018376.0,"Fucking relationships up in pursuit of the wrong person, which amazingly takes first place over dropping out of law school because at least in the latter I learned seriously valuable lessons. In the former, there were some lessons, sure, but I regret those days more than anything else in life and I want to erase all my memories about it."
AskReddit,fepnbk3,t3_eq1wzh,1579325105.0,"Me suddenly gaining the courage to take a leave of absence from law school for a year to address my weight gain and health problems, as well as find a job during that span so I can transfer to the evening class and earn for myself while studying. Because still being 100% reliant on my parents at my age (29) is honestly killing me so much on the inside, no matter what anyone says. I generally feel I'm on the right path in life; it's just that I need a little reset or a little pause to regain my motivation and focus, that's all."

AskReddit,f98bnrp,t3_e41px6,1575176321.0,"Getting a job. I'd been unemployed for some time and was depressed from feeling useless and unproductive, but was too scared to get out of it. Then a friend passed away, and it was a reality check that hit me hard. I started applying for jobs and was employed a month later."
AskReddit,f92bjow,t3_e380ez,1575022500.0,"Accomplishing a personal goal of reuniting a friend with another group of friends. We were all former schoolmates and the friend hadn't met with the others for about 5 years mostly due to how busy life got for all of us. That friend and I reconnected by chance 2 years ago and that's when I made it a point to make sure to get her back in the fold. It was so nice seeing us all together again!

Other than that, the year's been somewhat forgettable, but that's the general feel while in grad school anyway."
DetroitRedWings,f8xxzt4,t3_e2nkec,1574937729.0,"Born and raised in the Philippines, first exposure to hockey was through the Mighty Ducks movies. Got curious about the sport, and what I got from what little I was able to research was that the Detroit team was the best hockey team in the world. That was it from there, and y'know, that research didn't lie."
AskReddit,f8fi70u,t3_e0gzhn,1574544012.0,"I was told by my aunt that videogames caused my eyes to shrink, in an attempt to curb my excessive gaming. I believed her since my eyes were small, but the SNES was just too much fun to give up, so I resigned myself to them permanently shutting eventually. Turns out that she meant that my vision would decrease, and that my eyes being small was just me being Asian."
DetroitRedWings,f8fg7sm,t3_e0bgnr,1574543070.0,"West, hands down. I feel that the rivalries with Chicago/St. Louis were better than Toronto/Boston, and it's always fun to hate on the Avs. Plus, I liked cheering on Tampa Bay as my Eastern team rather than having them kick our teeth in as our main rival now.

I'm one of a handful of Wings fans in whose favor the 10:30 starts are, since I live on the other side of the world (Philippines, GMT+8) and those starts mean an late morning to early afternoon affair. So what seems to be the biggest gripe against Detroit being a Western team is actually a compelling positive for me."
KamenRider,f6b7ftq,t3_dqvmlo,1572769538.0,"Looking back now, I'm both glad that I grew up when the Sazers/Ryukendo/Tomica Heroes were solid 3rd options besides the Toei duo (I wasn't into Ultraman), and kind of saddened that I didn't appreciate it as much as I did at the time."
silverchair,f5rwp8k,t3_doye17,1572404825.0,"I've always thought that Neon Ballroom had the stronger individual songs (Ana's Song, Miss You Love, Emotion Sickness, Paint Pastel Princess, etc.) but Diorama was the better album overall, so Diorama."
AskReddit,f44y7ni,t3_djabmx,1571361535.0,"Had some alcoholic uncles on both sides, and both sides of the family made efforts to conceal it when they went off the rails. But even then, it was obvious to me as a kid that these uncles seemed to be the problem children (from my perspective, ""least successful"") of the families. When I discovered the straight edge subculture, I jumped on immediately."
AskReddit,f17ubkw,t3_d812gg,1569248463.0,"Decided to do 5 squats in the bathroom before taking a bath for no reason. Didn't realize that I haven't done them in forever; that I gained a lot of weight since then; that my form was off, leaning too much on one side of the foot; and that I was on slightly uneven flooring. The result was severe inflammation in my left foot that kept me limping for a long while."
AskReddit,f0lg8u9,t3_d4za97,1568716580.0,"Entered law school straight out of college years ago to delay getting a job. Flunked out after the first year. Delayed another 4 years, partly-unemployed and partly-shitty job before realizing being a lawyer was what I wanted to be all along. Now back in law school and all my friends from college are lawyers. Kinda wish I came to the realization earlier, but to each in his/her own time, I guess."

AskReddit,f0gsepp,t3_d4oyoc,1568605287.0,"Tried out ESL teaching since I was proficient in the language and loved all the teaching excursions in college. Japanese company I joined had advertised working with junior high students. On the first day, I was informed that their junior high program wouldn't be ready until 3 months in, and I had to teach elementary school students in the meantime. I went from expecting a sense of formality with teaching to basically doing my best Blue's Clues schtick day in and day out, with all my co-workers being as crazy-loud and energetic as the environment demanded (I'm really quiet and introverted). I left 5 months in when I was told the junior high program would wait another year. I'm now in law school and I can honestly say I prefer the pain and suffering here."

SuicideWatch,eznkqt7,t3_d1fx4w,1568007419.0,"I used to feel this way exclusively until 3 years ago when two of my friends in law school passed away due to cancer. I would've gladly given my years to both of them, so they could go on and be great lawyers and make a difference.

I still feel this way nowadays, just not as strongly because I've managed to flip it a little bit and right now I'm striving to make it through law school myself (since it was my dream as well) and be the guy I felt my two friends could've been. I feel like I owe it to them at least to try and live out the dreams they couldn't attain. 3 people's dreams in 1 depressed dude. IMHO it's a selfish reason, to take what could've been their lives and make it my own, but it definitely keeps me from regretting each and every day that I lived.

I hope you find your version of this, selfish or otherwise, whatever keeps you going in a world where it seems like we're just not worth the life compared to others. I consider this my panacea, and it's not a permanent cure, but I'll down it every day for whatever it helps to remind me of the purpose I chose to have for the lovely gents who can't make those choices anymore."
SquaredCircle,ezjglef,t3_d13j5w,1567944312.0,"Bryan Danielson vs. Go Shiozaki at ROH Live in Tokyo 2007. I'm biased because it was my first Danielson match, and this after being weaned on the WWE style, so it blew my mind. Looking back, it was one of Danielson's best efforts but not so much Go's, but it still gets a good rep: [currently sitting at a 9.27 on Cagematch](https://www.cagematch.net/?id=111&nr=3406)"

AskReddit,eybc6wx,t3_cw2mw6,1566980933.0,"My biggest failure and biggest redemption happened this decade (although to be fair, I'm only in my late 20's, so a lot of life hasn't happened yet). I went to law school; flunked out; got depression and failed on two suicide attempts; managed to keep myself mentally stable through workouts and novels; got my first job; left that job fairly quickly; re-entered law school, and finally got past the subjects that caused me to flunk out initially.

My biggest failure was of course flunking out, and wanting to die as a result. The fact that I'm still here and actually working towards the goal I abandoned years ago would be my greatest achievement. I'm seriously happy that I'll enter the next decade with a purpose."

I'll always irrationally love him for being the top line center for the Griffins' 2013 Calder Cup run (centering Gustav Nyquist and Tomas Tatar), despite having a so-so NHL career as a 4th liner before leaving 3 years ago. There was one game in 2014 where all our centers were injured (Datsyuk, Zetterberg, Weiss, Helm, etc.) so Joker was pegged to be the 1st line center to reunite that Calder line; he got thrown into Babcock's line blender after the first 2-3 shifts."

SquaredCircle,eu1sdfd,t3_cebvch,1563374325.0,"Didn't really think much of him before his GHC Junior Heavyweight title reign in 2015. His shtick finally started making sense during that reign when he held the division on lock as an apathetic champ combined with that trickster in-ring style, and I became a fan then. Glad that it carried over when Suzuki-gun came back to NJPW 2 years later and was pleased when he went up to heavy and started really showing what he could do, and invoking Kawada in matches. He's definitely a guy you have to let grow on you, and he's at his best when he has something that his rival wants, be it respect/recognition (Naito, Tana) or a belt (Ishimori and Daisuke Harada in Noah).

As for fans loving him, in my opinion it's because he's toiled in his undercard role for so long and so effectively that he quietly gained an aura similar to that of a blue-collar underdog's, and Japanese fans respect the hell out of that. The pop he got when he was announced for the G1 was unreal."

He just filled a role, as expected, and got flipped to Philly later on.

I also remember being super hyped about our future during this season after winning Game 4 OT against the Ducks in the first round. The GWG was by Brunner, assisted by Nyquist and Andersson, but it took a Lashoff check behind the net and a Kindl pass to Joker to make that play happen. All young guys, all stepping up, all looking to make it big. Today, only Lashoff remains with the org. Oh well. *EDIT: [Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-j6bZGNmbw) of the sequence, and my memory's slightly off, Lashoff makes the check right beside Jimmy."
hockey,esdtuoz,t1_escoqk5,1561868518.0,"This is my answer too, though a decent chunk of his fall is bad luck. The injury setting him back was bad, but all of a sudden he has to compete with a number of guys vying for regular roster spots in Hirose/Rasmussen/DLR/Ehn/Zadina/Veleno, and that made his situation much, much worse.

DetroitRedWings,es2bl7j,t1_es1tus9,1561519246.0,"Marek Zidlicky was very good for us during his short stint as a Wing. Definitely not fantastic, but more than serviceable. This was during the time that we gained a little bit of infamy for only having left-shot d-men, and Zidlicky gave us that RH shot and offensive d-man Babcock wanted at the time. We let him go to FA the next season since we signed Mike Green in that same period. I still remember being very bitter that we didn't have Zidlicky (injury) and Kronwall (suspension) for the season-ending Game 7 against the Lightning.

If we're talking just the post-'13 lockout trade deadline acquisitions, it's only Zidlicky that stands out for me as good. Erik Cole passed the eye test but suffered a career-ending injury before he could make any real impact; and David Legwand did just decently as a panic acquistion since we lost all our centers to injuries, but the modern narrative on that trade is that it's one of Holland's worst deals, having given up Calle Jarnkrok and Patrick Eaves and a pick in the process."
