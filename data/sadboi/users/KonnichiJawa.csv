Kaczynski's alleged link to EarthFirst! was even bullshit. EF! won a large settlement against the FBI after being accused of involvement in bombings / with Kaczynski.

For me, yes, it helps my health anxiety a lot. That's the exact reason why I decided to try it, I was convincing myself that I was seconds from death every day. I realized that my anxiety will always evolve and affect me until I did something about it.

I would get heart palpitations, numbness in my limbs, tight chest, and digestive issues. Now if I am super stressed, which has happened once since starting Zoloft, I will still get (or I think I'm getting) some heart palpitations but not as bad.

By the end of the first week, my only side effect was bad drowsiness.

By the third week, I started seeing the positive effects. I started reading again, was hardly overthinking, and just in a good mood which is not normal for me lol

And now, 4 months later, my only complaint is that it flares my insomnia and nightmares a few days a week. I used to be adamantly against medication and really regret that. Zoloft has helped so much, I have to wonder what my life could have been.

For the record, I could have taken the Zoloft before bed to combat the drowsiness but it was affecting my insomnia too much at first. By the time my insomnia started leveling out again, the drowsiness wasn’t an issue either.

I hope you have good results! Don’t get discouraged regardless of how it works out and keep in mind that you may need to try a few meds before you find what helps you most."

Does she have a therapist or someone she can talk to - even you? She may be repressing feelings of fear, anxiety, anger, depression, etc. If she can express these feelings in a safe place with someone she trusts, it may put her mind at ease.

No sugar at least one hour before she goes to bed!! This is huge, I can always tell when I eat sugar too late, my nightmares are at their worst. 

A weighted blanket helps me fall asleep. It's like being wrapped in a hug from head to toe. You can find relatively cheap ones on Amazon or at stores like TJ Maxx or Ross. If she's interested, look them up first so you get the correct weight. Cuddling is great as well.

Have white noise or gentle, instrumental music playing when she falls asleep. I use a fan but soft, pretty music without singing works too. My fiance prefers natural sounds - ocean waves, rain, etc.

Aromatherapy in the bedroom. An oil diffuser, or even her favorite incense would work. I don't recommend candles for safety purposes.

As for the sleep paralysis, I don't have much to offer there. I know that being very exhausted, sleeping on your back, and sleeping in an uncomfortable position can make it more likely. It's the most terrifying thing I've experienced in my life, so hopefully a way of avoiding it becomes mainstream soon!"
