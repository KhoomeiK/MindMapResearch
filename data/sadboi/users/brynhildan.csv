If people had at least half a mind can see that patience is virtue! America has more COVID-19 cases more than any place in the world and the number of deaths is just over the top. 

Bottom line: The economy will be in worse shape if we ease restrictions before the spread of infection stops. BECAUSE it will take longer for 1) number of cases to lessen 2) for the economy to open up

Here is what I know. States govern their own border control rules. It's not federally mandated. Meaning, if you are from the south, people will probably follow Trump even more. 

It's going to be a long time before America fully recover. People want to rush to go back to work even with ongoing COVID-19 cases, but it just means a much longer time for economic recovery if you delay the process of easing the spread of the virus. It's very simply logic, a lot of people don't get it. 

Americans definitely live in their own little bubble but we need to properly quarantine before loosening any restrictions, especially with this gigantic population size!"

What you went through is definitely traumatic. But I would not just say it is PTSD so quickly. PTSD is a very serious thing and it is lifelong. The event you went through is definitely traumatic and very upsetting. But you need to focus on your mental health right now. Reflect on the memories of your dad as if he is still there and write down all the great things about him. Hold that close to you and  feel strength through that you were able to spend your 23 years with your father and be able to spend all those happy memories with him.

Be at least thankful that his passing was not a long and painful one. It was definitely abrupt which I would not lie, definitely adds to the trauma. But your dad did not suffer. He went up to heaven to join the good people."

Don't ignore the red flags. I gave so many second chances, third chances to people I now know for a fact I cannot trust. I was in your shoes too, I gave people the benefit of the doubt for many things. Now I keep my distance and guard up towards people who acts shady to me in private but suddenly a goody two shoes in public --- despite having being passive aggressive towards me literally 10 minutes ago.

*""This is just one instance, they are not normally like this""* 

One behaviour is an indicator of how they think. Someone with a good heart will never have bad intentions for somebody else especially if it meant taking time out of someones valuable spare time. 

*""Maybe they think of me as a close friend, that is why they divulge so many bad things to me""* 

That's just them showing their true colours. 

*""They act nice to other people and other people seem to think they are a good person but in private they have abused me""* 

This gets me the most. Kind of like your situation with the bridesmaids on Zoom. People like this exist, they take advantage of the people they think are ""weak"" or is too nice. They walk all over them. They don't care what you think about them because they know you don't get the message. A good person won't form a dynamic with you where they will treat you with less respect simply because they think they can take advantage of you."

I also struggle making ""best friends"". I have friends that I hang out here and there but sometimes you just don't have the energy in you to go that extra mile. It's hard for a lot of people who work 9-5. You merely have to look towards people who travel for a living. They barely get time to see their loved ones let alone make very good friends. It's hard. 

It depends if you really want to have a best friend because you want one or for the sake of having one to fit the ""mold"".

The small bumps and congestion on your skin is sometimes caused by improper cleansing of your face. Especially since you use sunscreen and put so many heavy things on your skin, I recommend double cleansing.

I have combination skin. I have dry in my T-Zone and oily everywhere else. So when I was introduced to the idea of double cleansing (oil/balm remover + cleanser). I was confused. But how it works is that the oil pulls out impurities from your pores and then the cleanser is just another thorough cleanse ontop of that.

I think it varies depending on each individual but I can give you a recount for the past 3 days for me.

Day 1: 

I felt great no side effects whatsoever, things that would usually worry me did not worry me anymore and my friends all around me tells me I seem a lot cheerful and happy. Nausea sets in midday after my coffee, it came in waves (I never had nausea this bad before). Several times I felt like I was on the verge of vomiting. It doesn't stop until I have something to eat later that night.

Day 2: 

Still feeling cheerful, energetic I don't take my afternoon nap like I would usually (I just have so much energy). I get diarrhoea in the morning (sorry too much TMI but it's one of the symptoms). I'm feeling great still!"

Ofcourse I still think about things I used to worry about but it doesn't effect me to the same extent anymore! Also my cognitive function is so much better.

I think what I had before was a pseudodementia, which can be caused by depression. I was a normally bright and quick witted girl but I guess after the depression it really numbed my mind. I did not want to engage with people or things around me, I just wanted to silence my mind.

If you have experience working with older people, they can't handle the fact that they are an equal to someone much much younger. They want to boss you around because they think you are probably like their own child who is lazy and dirty but obviously that's not the case, because you have a full time job already at your age and share the same position as more experienced people. You just need to demonstrate that you are mature and they will respect you. That means not talking badly about anyone that's super taboo in the work place! Especially if it's a small team, word spreads very quickly. You will be immensely surprised how quickly a rumour would spread especially if 1) you're new and young 2) relative of the super 3) said something offensive"
AskAnAmerican,f7c90wr,t1_f7c84ls,1573587074.0,My cousins who live in America says otherwise. Apparently there are kids still wandering around at midnight?
AskAnAmerican,f7c7pd5,t1_f7bjnrj,1573586247.0,"I'm not sure about where you come from but in the suburbs in Illinois, the kids are definitely still wondering around past midnight."
AskAnAmerican,f7b5p1v,t1_f7b5h3z,1573557154.0,"Oh dear! I am so so sorry that happened to you. You guys are the most loveliest bunch of people. Although firearms are banned in Australia, we do get bad people with bad intent get a hold of it at the wrong times. It's inescapable."
unpopularopinion,f7b4nrw,t3_dp45z4,1573555580.0,"I agree with you. I did a lot of travelling when I was young and visited most major continents in the world and have lived on another continent as well as Australia. 

I would say Australia is one of the most underwhelming of them all (besides China). Here's my ranking: 

1) America 

2) UK 

3) Hong Kong 

4) Australia

Why is Australia last on my list? It really is shocking in terms of affordability. Many people think our healthcare system is universal or ""free"", when it really isn't. We have large taxes embedded in everything, housing affordability is in a crisis, many things are unaffordable if it's ""Made in Australia"", and our ""high minimum wage"" isn't supportive of how expensive the cost is for necessities. The social system is just a lot easier to navigate but it doesn't mean any of this is free. 

Obviously it's easy to live in because I grew up here all my life and have a social structure built around me that supports me living here. But if I could move some place else, I would definitely in a heart beat! Outside of our ridiculous unaffordable lifestyle, which demands us to work to live, there isn't much else to do. Our most iconic landmark that defines Australian landscape is a red rock in the middle of no where.   
There are more strikingly beautiful red rock formations all over America! Look at: death valley and the Grand Canyon.

A lot of people praise Australia mostly for its beautiful nature but its dried up forests comes nothing close to the lush green woodlands from Utah, Portland, Lake Tahoe to Colorado. 

If you were immobile then Australia is a great place to be, but if you have two legs and you are healthy with a raging passion in you to enjoy life, America is the place to be!"
AskAnAmerican,f7b3qfr,t3_dqtw0v,1573554123.0,"Hey fellow Australian!

I notice the exact same thing, if you were to bring up the first thing about America to an Australian who has never set foot in America. They will vent on about how bizarre America is and there gun laws and that they are so nationalist and racist. So contrary!!! I am surprised we are hating on American culture when everything we do is based off of American culture! Our technology we use all comes form America, our entertainment (music and movies) *ALL* american!"
AskAnAmerican,f7b3n05,t3_dnuvtz,1573553968.0,"There are no racist feelings towards ethnic Chinese people in America. There is however, definitely racist feelings towards Chinese people in Australia! I was always told the opposite but when I went to America I was shocked at how friendly and accepting everyone was. I went to more than 10 states and there was always some American who wanted to strike up a conversation with you and make you feel welcomed. You never get this kind of thing in Australia. Everyone just keeps to themselves or resent you quietly. I come to realise this as an ABC when white Australians will treat me like I was an alien even though I told them I was born here and they will bring up about ""overseas Chinese"" people and the ""bad things they do"", even though my ancestry is from China... My boyfriend who is white does not understand that this is a daily occurence so he is unfazed by it. 

In America I had so many people strike up a conversation with us and say ""Where you are from and I would like to say on behalf of America that we welcome you here and I hope you enjoy your stay!"" - literally from a hotel lobby conversation in America. That's just one example but it was definitely overwhelming with how many times that has happened when I was over there."
AskAnAmerican,f7b39ib,t1_f7b3611,1573553366.0,"I live in Australia but everyone thinks America is an unsafe place with all the shootings going around and that most people are living in poverty because of the minimum wage + healthcare. That's the general consensus from a lot of Australian's I know who hasn't been to America.

But I have been to America and I would trade living in Australia for America in a heartbeat."
AskAnAmerican,f7b37hx,t3_duxtm5,1573553275.0,It's pretty but have you seen Utah?
AskAnAmerican,f7b35ws,t3_dv43h2,1573553205.0,"There are lots of holidays big in their own right

Halloween, party again, dressing up and it's the biggest even for kids mostly. Some stay up past midnight trick or treating. Have a look at the houses and how they dress up their street on Halloween! It's so huge and fun!

Fourth of July, they have a BBQ, go to some beach house or partay

Independence day is also another excuse to do fourth of july all over again

Thanksgiving is definitely a family affair. A lot of millennial though who moved away from their home town usually have friends giving which is more like a pot luck kind of a deal. So big that a turkey gets pardoned 

Black friday...

Then Christmas which is universal"
AskAnAmerican,f7b304n,t3_duyvbk,1573552943.0,I haven't seen many people smoking in America perhaps smoking weed... but not tobacco smoking. I think it is because there are better things to spend money on when the minimum wage is so low

Caused me lots of problems till now where I struggle speaking up because I don't trust my own judgment."
jobs,f7amvei,t1_f7akqqh,1573533512.0,I did do that but it was not in a very elegant way. And I felt like I was mentioning things that they didn't want to know about even though I thought it showed I had knowledge of the operations of this particular sector.

Oh yes the White House was a lot more smaller and distant than I'd imagine... However, the Senate was HUGE.
I really love DC, everyone seemed civilised there were people from all walks of life in government and most of all it was squirrels galore during autumn!"
