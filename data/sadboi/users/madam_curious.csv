My work life is actually going pretty well but emotionally am having a very tough time since the past one year. It all started after my break up where my ex hit me and I felt so humiliated and ashamed(could be why I was feeling that in the dream) now am with someone whom I like but am still not so sure. I have lot of insecurities and self confidence issues in my personal life which bothers me all the time. But because I spend most of my time in office I manage to keep a poker face. I also don‚Äôt feel like sharing things with anyone because I feel they will judge me. My current boyfriend feels that I don‚Äôt share stuff with him and that I keep everything inside and it‚Äôs weird because I am not able to share stuff with him. I tend to forget everything at the time when he asks me why am I so upset. Plus my current boyfriend keeps confusing me says he wants to be with me then another day he would say the other way round and mentally I just feel fucked up. He keeps blaming me for not being what he expected and then after a while he apologises saying he‚Äôs not perfect either. He cribs a lot and it bothers me. He‚Äôs a little dominating. But I know he has a wonderful heart and he feels bad after doing everything. He even talked to his parents about me and wants to marry me. But somehow all of this is taking a toll on my mental life. I am sick of making him happy all the time
