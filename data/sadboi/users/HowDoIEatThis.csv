autism,fqxalgd,t3_glgiur,1589729029.0,"I do agree somewhat with some of your post. I do believe in euthanasia to a degree. If I’m terminally ill and I’m in immense pain, then I should get to decide when and the manner I should die. I think that is a kindness we should offer everyone. However, when it comes to a non fatal condition, how does one create an objective metric for a valuable life?

Are you actually of sound mind to be making that decision? Is there no other way to improve your conditions? Why does the value of your life depend on how much you can do backflips for capitalism? And if your life is bad, is it actually because of your disability or is it that society didn’t provide you the means to make it worth living? Because a good society is able to look after the most vulnerable. You shouldn’t have to die because your society sucks.

I think before we can even consider euthanasia as an option for non fatal disabilities, we need to actually have a good system for treating mental health conditions and social services that help people thrive. The vast majority of autistic people, whether we can work or not, actually like living and we are in danger of essentially grooming people to be suicidal if we normalise the idea that autism (or any disability) equals a life of suffering. 

If you ask me, I don’t think it makes any sense to euthanise anyone that isn’t suffering from a terminal illness. Euthanasia should be an option during end of life planning. Autism is nowhere near as bad as actually dying."

ABA,fqx7542,t1_fqt1grv,1589727277.0,"I was never in ABA. I received Speech and Language Therapy, which works differently. ABA is not widely used in my country as SLT is seen as the standard over here. I think they do implement some skinner-esque concepts for some people, but my treatment was predominantly about giving me the tools I need to communicate and to understand others. It was set up like a classroom, basically. It was like learning a second language, I guess. 

I’m glad that you appreciate my perspective and I’m glad that you don’t employ any coercive means to get your clients to engage in certain tasks. I also want to point out that while I do understand that ultimately it’s the parents/guardians who can give consent on behalf of their child, it’s still the client who is getting the treatment. I can tell that you do prioritise your clients and try to respect their autonomy. I just find it concerning when I hear people talking about what everyone around the client wants but not what they want, as if they aren’t living, feeling, sapient humans. I’m sure you agree with me here, but understand that many people on the spectrum have been harmed by ABA therapists who did not respect their personhood and just saw them as walking list of symptoms to correct. If most of the feedback you’re getting from former ABA clients is negative, you need to examine why that is. Even if your practice is ethical and nurturing, you can’t ignore the fact that these people were hurt.

Even in dog training (and trust me - I’ve had german shepherds my whole life) you have to respect that animal’s boundaries and not try to turn them into a furry human because that’s impossible. If we can afford that dignity to our animals, we should be able to do so for our own children."
ABA,fqswmgh,t1_fqcn18d,1589621545.0,"“Does that make me wrong for trying to implement those programs because I see the value in them, and the client doesn't?“

I mean, kind of?

I’m not saying that it’s a bad thing to push someone outside their comfort zone sometimes, but I’m pretty sure the role of a therapist involves mutual consent. Like, if you have to coerce your client to do something, is it really ethical?

I understand that sometimes you have to employ a bit of tough love and sometimes consent is not an option, such as when someone is under a psychiatric hold. However, I have to wonder if you can see how what you said is kind of iffy from a professional perspective.

I received speech and language therapy throughout my childhood for autism. I don’t remember being forced to do anything. I don’t remember doing something I didn’t understand. I was there to learn life skills, not to be coerced to do something upsetting.

Maybe you can help your clients find the value in what they’re doing by using those fixations to their benefit. For instance, if the client is obsessed with their tablet, why not use it in your sessions? If you’re teaching them to use PECS, the tablet is perfect! Perhaps you and the client can use face app and make a fun game out of recognising emotions while also having fun with the settings. I know that for myself my therapist used my obsession with Pokemon to motivate me. 

Positive reinforcement works for us, like, a lot."

It’s not always possible to predict when something will trigger you and it’s not necessarily your fault if you do get triggered, of course. However, I don’t think it’s helpful to pre-empt every single situation that could potentially trigger psychiatric symptoms. In fact, one of the ways panic disorder is so insidious is that trying to avoid panic attacks can make it worse.

I understand that trauma is different and experiencing a flashback can be potentially dangerous, especially if you’re driving or crossing the street or prone to self harm, etc. I know trauma has to be carefully and methodically treated in order to process that traumatic event.

I didn’t have the option of a trigger warning back then. I had to identify my own triggers and prepare for times when I might encounter them again. Many of my triggers weren’t something that would be obvious or easy to predict, either. Changes in air pressure, humidity, textures, smells, flickering strip lights - these were some of the triggers I had that would throw me into a panic response. It’s not fair to make other people hypervigilant about things that could possibly trigger me, especially when triggers can be so personal and so irrational.

I think trigger warnings have their place. They can be a very useful tool when used appropriately. I also think that it’s important to be conscientious of others mental health issues and try to accommodate them. However, I am ultimately responsible for managing my own triggers. You have to take initiative and make a plan for what to do before, during and after a potentially triggering event.

Pain management was very difficult and she was very distressed and irritable, which made me upset because I wanted her to have a peaceful passing.

They give you booklets about the dying process, saying that it’s not painful. Well, maybe at the very end, but before then it can be excruciating. I have awful memories of her in so much pain that she was screaming and I couldn’t do anything about it. The nurses and carers did everything they could but sometimes drugs can’t help.

Where I come from, talking therapies are very difficult to get. You go on a long waiting list so your problem might continue to escalate while you wait for your first appointment. We prescribe antidepressants before talking treatments and it should be the other way around. No wonder people’s normal neurosis become full fledged mental health issues with such a broken healthcare system. It’s not entirely the fault of the patient.

I think in future he should work on a few studies before committing to the final piece, but that’s a habit a lot of people don’t get into. Doing thumbnails and studies will dramatically improve your art.

I’d love to see them practice crosshatching, as ink drawing seems to be their strongest area. I hope that they keep practicing, especially if it’s something they enjoy.

I’m not attacking the drawing. Just the attitude that they’re somehow showing the normies what for by having a pretty normal hobby."

Your argument is so fucking retarded. How is it unethical or immoral to be a hoe? One consenting party provides a service that other consenting adults purchase. There is literally nothing unethical about this - it’s just capitalism.

As for her somehow devaluing herself, that’s a value judgement that people like you make. It’s not an objective fact. It’s just moralfags like you that like to jerk off over “muh traditional values” like I’m supposed to give a shit. Nobody else has to have the same values as you."
BPD,flrigte,t1_flquivm,1585420877.0,"A lot of learning how to deal with interpersonal conflict is knowing that communication is a transaction. Both parties should be doing their part to listen and effectively communicate. If you and a loved one have fallen into a toxic communication style, then both parties have to unlearn that, not just you. 

I see it in families all the time. Shit will go down because one person says something that the other person thinks is a micro aggression (and it could very well be for all I know). Either way, they don’t give each other the benefit of the doubt. If someone in the family has obvious problems, the family will sometimes scapegoat that family member even though I can see that each and every one of them has serious issues they aren’t actually addressing. The “problem” person is a convenient distraction from their own dysfunction. So how can one expect good interpersonal effectiveness from one person in a family unit when the rest of the family aren’t willing to cooperate and ends up setting that person up for failure?

I don’t have BPD but I do know that sometimes people don’t really want you to be honest because they just aren’t able to handle it. In a dysfunctional family, for instance, actually listening to and addressing the problems of a loved one means having to address your own issues. If you’re not prepared to look at your own issues in a family unit, it’s easier to project and say that the other person is the one with the problem. Then they can hold it against you for not talking to them because “hey, how do I know what’s going on if they don’t tell me?”. It’s a maddening cycle and it’s all to deflect from what’s really happening.

My advice is that you shouldn’t have to share your feelings with people who hold that against you."

BPD doesn't mean that your emotions aren't valid and part of therapy is learning to validate and accept your emotions. Where in DBT does it say that you don't get to defend your case or that your feelings are never based in reality?

I have ADHD and autism and people do this to me as well sometimes. ""Oh, it's just your autism that makes you this this way"". Funny, nothing in the diagnostic criteria says that I can't observe reality. Must be a footnote they wrote with invisible ink. Anyone got a black light handy? I think I missed that edition of the DSM-V. 

Ableism is such bullshit."

It’s not the drugs themselves that are the issue, it’s the context in which they are used. If you’re given these drugs in a medical setting and/or your doctor is carefully monitoring your dosage then it’s not comparable to shooting heroin in a gas station bathroom stall. 

And yes, people do abuse prescription drugs, but medicine is all about balancing the benefits and the risks, but I promise you that the vast majority of people on heroin are not addicts. Same goes for methylphenidate, amphetamines and cocaine- they’re all used in medicine fairly regularly. It’s not always that easy to end up an addict."

I’m more of a sensory thinker than a language thinker. I sometimes call it having a ‘cave man brain’. Perhaps language doesn’t come as naturally to me as it should.

It’s like you said - it’s a black curtain, usually caused by stress, anxiety or sensory overload. I do try to script as much as I can but that is rarely an option for me in my line of work. Clearly I need to work smarter, not harder.

Still, I do think it would be a good idea to compile a reading list for myself. Admittedly, there’s a lot of books I want to read but just haven’t made time for.
