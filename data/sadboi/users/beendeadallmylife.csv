SuicideWatch,fds2o66,t1_fds1m8k,1578693426.0,"Its always bad. Women with endometriosis can be hooked up to those labor simulations at a full 10 and not flinch. Ive had kidney stones I didn't know about, a broke ankle wrist fingers and toe, and a gallstone about to rip through my gallbladder I didn't know about either because the pain of all that was like a scratch compared to the endometriosis. It acts like cancer only the tumors create their own blood supplies making them hurt the moment they start growing unlike with cancer it doesn't hurt until it's way late in the game or you've started treatment. And endometriosis unfortunately for me can't kill me fast or maybe at all."
