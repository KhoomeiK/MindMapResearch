vegan,fhg4452,t3_ex4pyo,1581558150.0,"I'm new to veganism (one month in!) I'm loving it and feeling great. That being said, I've broke out with (what I found on the internets as described as vegan acne) apparently caused by either a zinc deficiency, too much protein from soy products, or just my body being shocked by the change. I've also noticed being cold all the time and starting to be tired, which we all know is hallmark signs of anemia, let's add lack of iron. SOOO....I'm looking for a good vegan multivitamin or vitamin cocktail. My normal one just isn't cutting it. Any suggestions????"
theGoldenGirls,fhfgt1j,t1_fhfbhtx,1581543080.0,"""That's pretty jumpy."""
theGoldenGirls,fhfgrsd,t1_fhfbhtx,1581543060.0,I agree very good line! So good the scene is used in the intro!
theGoldenGirls,fhf0627,t1_fhezpbe,1581533488.0,"I relate most to Bea, which is why I always say she is my favorite but I think Rue makes me laugh more."

theGoldenGirls,fh1nc0j,t3_f0vgzd,1581218765.0,the best thing I've ever heard!!!!
BPD,fghln2h,t1_fgfkty8,1580787630.0,"I'm very honest with my friends as well, that probably has alot to do with it. And most of them have some sort of diagnosis themselves lol they understand."
BorderlinePDisorder,fgfhgxm,t1_fgfew22,1580738854.0,"SO SORRY SO LONG. THIS MIGHT BELONG SOMEWHERE ESLE. THIS TOPIC JUST SPARKED THIS THOUGHT. Ya, know I totally get that ""cant get myself to do it"" feeling and as much as I hate hurting people around me i just can't seem to get myself to do therapy. My psychiatrist has a wonderful dbt program at his office and was the first one on the list to start when he was getting a therapist for it. (Talk about being 1st place winner...lol) but I was all for the idea. But I've lost all interest in even starting the program. I started thinking why? Why? Do I not want to do this? And then it hit me. I'm afraid of getting better. If I get better then I wont have any reason for getting ""too mad"" and exploding or any reason for feeling anything. I've come to use my bpd as a say to give myself permission to feel feelings. But total props for everyone who has the courage to tackle this shit!"
Anxiety,fgfgh5u,t1_fgdqbu4,1580738048.0,"Omg! Yes, I'm a mom so repetitive noises happen quite often in my house especially with toys. I get so frustrated and irritated. (I try to keep my cool bc I have borderline personality disorder and controlling how I react to situations is a 24/7 battle.) But it just keeps going and going then my husband will need me to do something then a kid tells for help and I just explode ðŸ¤¬"
BPD,fg8we1y,t1_fg8nctf,1580630664.0,"I found this a very interesting subject as well and why I decided to share on here. I haven't been able to find any articles yet, but I also haven't done real research. I've just kinda threw it out there for a few friends and have thought about it from time to time.  If I come across any I will share!"
dpdr,fg8vj8m,t3_ewv1i6,1580630291.0,"Sometimes when I look down or move my eyes quickly my eyelids do a sort of ""flutter"" and a split sec of blur. Never thought of this possibly being a symptom of DR??"
dpdr,fg8rzxe,t3_exkn59,1580628738.0,"YES!!! I do this about 98% of the time I drive. the only time this doesn't happen is when I'm going somewhere new and have to concentrate or follow directions, it's like I'm forcing my brain to stay ""with"" me. I never knew this was a a symptom of dissociating, I thought it was like a muscle memory type thing because It's places I drive everyday. This is good info because I plan on telling my psychiatrist the extent of my dissociating and can add this to the examples."
BPD,fg8mucb,t1_fg8lne0,1580624773.0,"I'm so glad others have noticed this! I've tried to talk to friends about it who have depression, anxiety, and bipolar but no one has really been able to understand. I wonder if BPD seems to amplify the zodiac so much because it's a personality disorder??"
theGoldenGirls,fg88619,t1_fei3mxm,1580612098.0,I don't know why but I love this line...lol it seems more of a modern type of comedy.
theGoldenGirls,fg87dul,t3_etuwbc,1580611485.0,I need this in my life! Got a link to order it??
BPD,fg86t4x,t1_fg85wks,1580611048.0,"Yes! that's exactly what I'm talking about. for example: Capricorn's feelings are like magma. Subtle under the surface, explosive once released. Now if that isn't BPD...lol"
BPD,fg86iqp,t1_fg84kot,1580610830.0,do you see any similarities your zodiac personality and BPD symptoms?
