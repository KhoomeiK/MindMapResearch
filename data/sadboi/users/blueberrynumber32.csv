You should first try to get to know the guy separate from this friend to figure out if you actually like him. Do you have any classes with him? Or lunch? Even just an Instagram like and a smile at him in the hallway could put you on his radar! 

If you are able to get to know him and find you like his personality too, then let your friend know how you feel. If there’s a chance she’d react poorly, it’s better to be sure you don’t just like admiring him from afar. I know female friendships in high school can be tough, but she wouldn’t seem like a great friend anyway if she’d end your friendship over something so small. 

You can also test the waters with her by finding a way to bring him up and seeing how she responds. Good luck!"

Just let them know it’s no longer your place to be her emotional support but that you still care about her and you’re seriously concerned for her health (especially if she made any comments or shown any indication she may harm herself).

internetparents,fi0fqxr,t3_f5nnit,1582035902.0,"Ok don’t get too drunk. Nobody finds a sloppy person attractive. And remember most people at a college party are hoping to be noticed by someone (just like you). So you people are all in the same boat. 

First try to make eye contact with a girl you want to approach. It’ll put you on her radar and making eye contact in a crowded room is weirdly intimate. Then, when there’s an opening (she’s not in a conversation with her friends, she’s leaving the basement dance floor, going to grab a drink, etc) approach her with something to say. If she’s wearing a cool dress or shoes or something that stands out a bit about her, walk up and compliment that! I met my boyfriend (5 years going strong) at a house party because he made a comment about my sneakers. Or maybe if she looks bored you could say “you look like you need another drink, can I get you one?” Really just look for any sort of “in” to approach her. If you’re able to make contact and she responds, but you’re in a loud room, ask if she wants to go get some water or another drink or something so you can have an actual conversation.  

If you’re both on the dance floor, make your way near her, make eye contact, and ask if she wants to dance (side note: when dancing with a girl, follow her lead, don’t go straight to grabbing her hips and smushing your pelvis into her butt like it’s middle school). Or, if you’re both watching a drinking game, go stand next to her and ask if she wants to be your teammate for the next game. 

If she’s in a group of girls and they are stuck together, grab a wingman and approach them all (compliment them, say something about the party, etc). if they seem interested in chatting, you can then strike up a conversation with the girl you’re interested in and go from there. 

And most importantly don’t get discouraged at being rejected - she doesn’t know you at all and you don’t know her. Guys still do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to approaching/initial flirting so don’t take it personally if someone isn’t interested. At first it might hurt your ego a bit but who tf cares if some random person doesn’t want to talk to you, just say “have a great night” and move on to the next one!"

If so, maybe you could call them and explain the situation and coordinate the refunds/exchanges/returns to take some of the burden off your bridesmaids. I think it falls on you if you didn’t do enough research before telling them to order, so don’t put it all on them to fix it. Would you consider embracing the slightly mismatched look though? Personally I think it looks cool and different. But If the dresses are a like bright poppy red and you wanted a burgundy color, you wouldn’t be TA for wanting to return them and I think your bridesmaids should understand that - but still do whatever you can to help them out with the process since they were just doing what you asked. Attached is a picture of a woman I know who did dark red bridesmaid dresses and even with the tone slightly off (see girl second from right) it looks cool and classy.

I’ve been wanting to for a while but was afraid to ask, then one night we had an organic conversation about it and were both 100% on board. Our rationale is that there are some things we cannot get from each other but would like to explore (example - he has a thing for older women). Ground rules are that we must check in before it happens, it can’t be anyone we know, and it must be strictly sexual. Also STD testing. 

He was the first one to do it (I have yet to) and it went surprisingly smoothly. I even asked him for play-by-play details and I found the whole thing exciting. I think I need to try too to see if he feels as good about it as I did, but as long as there is a really solid foundation of trust and communication and love it can be an awesome new dimension to the relationship. And honestly I was super excited to explore but now that I have a free pass to I haven’t been very eager to hook up with anyone. We also have a great sex life to begin with which I think is really important too.

Every nation has their own particular understanding of freedom/rights/government/democracy etc. that had been developed within the unique history/cultural makeup of that country. For example, many countries cherish the idea of “free speech.” Broadly speaking, the US understands free speech to include even grossly offensive talk (“it’s our right to say whatever we want, our first amendment! To suppress free speech is to suppress democracy” is how US ideology may roughly sound). France equally supports freedom of expression (it’s in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen) but their idea of what that means (again, generalizing ideology) differs. Due to a shaky history of multiple changes in their government over the centuries, along with many other historical events, the French dislike any sort of divisive public speech that could threaten the cohesiveness of their democracy. One’s not necessarily more right than the other, they are just different. 

So, back to your question, healthcare and public schooling are sites to garner political, cultural and economic power, and the US government has painted each in a certain light to meet specific ends (depending on the goals of that particular elected body at the time). Throughout US history the right to private healthcare developed into the more “free/democratic” choice over universal healthcare. I’m sure this is due to in part the major social stratification/segregation where the rich have the ability and therefore want to be able to buy the best healthcare they can. Also corporations like big pharma lobbying in the government for more $$$. Because Americans have been taught that socialism = communism = evil, calling universal healthcare socialism creates an easy win. Public education has ulterior political motivations as well. It is a great tool for state/nat’l gov’t to choose what and how kids learn. I’m an American who went to public school, and looking back, somehow US history appeared much more rosey than reality. This is the case in many places across the world. Also, because public school serves as a way to control how and what Americans learn, it has been promoted as an integral part of our democracy. 

Super long answer that doesn’t even scratch the surface of the complex political and cultural history of healthcare and public schooling, but hopefully it sheds some light!"

Sorry to hear you’re struggling socially - but no one is ever universally liked so don’t waste your time stressing if you can’t make friends with everyone!

But I’m curious to hear if you may be doing something that is unintentionally turning people off."

offmychest,exjqmn2,t3_ctaaud,1566357485.0,This is such a huge step so good on you for doing it. I went through this a few years ago. It’s an emotionally draining journey but also so gratifying and eye opening once you let you be truthful and kind to yourself. Best of luck.
AskReddit,ewlxvcm,t3_cori3p,1565538565.0,"My childhood best friend and I grew apart in middle school because she went to private school and we sort of stopped having things in common. A decade later (a month ago) our parents ran into each other and found out both of us were in need of a roommate to get an apartment in the city. We grabbed drinks to see if we could work as roommates and it felt pretty normal! She was exactly the same as I remembered her, just now an adult. And we discovered we actually have a lot in common today. Just signed a lease together and now it’s like I have a new but old friend? I’m excited to get to know her again."

findapath,ew4zd3x,t1_eve8eme,1565122590.0,"Sorry for the late reply! I wanted to study something more grounded/tangible  - I don’t do too well focusing on strictly the abstract (sociology is the study of society while philosophy is the study of knowledge). There is certainly overlap, but I was more interested in learning about the mechanisms behind social phenomena. But both are great for developing critical thinking and writing skills. 

Both are pretty broad, but I’d suggest going for whichever makes you feel more excited - look at your uni’s course breakdown for each major. And then you can always minor in another more focused interest like media and screen studies or something like that!"
findapath,eve828a,t3_cj7bko,1564458334.0,"Sociology!! I felt the same exact way you are feeling as an undergrad. I was always fascinated with why people behave like we do but I knew I could never make it through even a basic ‘hard’ science course.

Sociology is all about learning how to remove yourself from your environment (your perception of yourself and surrounds/way of understanding the world/taken for granted biases) and analyzing different aspects of life. You can study anything from how structural adjustment programs affect the day-to-day lives of people in Cairo to what makes up the ‘finance bro’ to memes. You can sort of think of it as studying the ‘nature’ side of the ‘nature vs nurture’ debate. Of course it’s never just one or the other. Sociology is concerned with how people make meaning of and are affected by their environments. 

It’s mostly reading and writing (but no exams 🎉)

If you’re not going into a technical field don’t stress too much about your major - but do make sure you have a few internships under your belt to explore some industries and positions.

raisedbynarcissists,euhii6v,t3_cgct2s,1563827958.0,"I’m so sorry you and your sisters have to/had to live in an environment like this - I grew up in one extremely similar and starved myself to the point where I was ‘hours’ away from heart failure according my team of doctors when they finally forced my parents to check me into the hospital - they didn’t think there was a problem until the doctors had to sit them down and essentially tell them it was borderline neglect. 

The most twisted part of it was that it started when I was in middle school and was never bigger than a size 2.  My parents’ criticism of others and their extreme focus on bodies still got me. But to be clear no matter what size someone is/was at any point, EDs are extremely serious and detrimental to a person’s wellbeing. 

If possible, I’d suggest reaching out to both sisters and tell them you are seriously concerned. Not one person (even my pediatrician) was able to say “eating disorder” to me over a two year period of obvious red flags (not to mention my declining physical state). I really wish someone could’ve let me know they were there for me. 

Regardless of your parents’ twisted view, many parents with children who have EDs remain in denial even when the situation becomes dire. It’s of course not on you to tackle a hugely complicated disorder, but any way you can approach your sisters from a compassionate but firm point of view is a good first step. Maybe checking in with their friends to get their take and possible help would be worth while as well (especially if contacting your parents to take action is out of the question). 

Please don’t hesitate to pm me (or anyone else reading) if you want any information about my experience in a similar environment/need help with how to approach them/anything else. 

I’ll be thinking about your sisters and I hope they can find peace with themselves x"

Some major ones to check out + ones with a focus on love/relationships:
- American journal of sociology
- Gender and Society
- Social Problems
- Sociological Theory
- Journal of social and personal relationships
- Media, culture and society 
- Sexualities
- journal of social and personal relationships
- Group processes & intergroup relations

You’ll be able to find a large amount of qualitative and quantitative studies. You should also be able to search Columbia’s database by journal, and scan articles by volume/issue. But don’t limit yourself to these! There are a ton of great papers/journals out there. Good luck!"
