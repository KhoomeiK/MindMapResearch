Asthma,fr4nh2t,t1_fr457hj,1589892855.0,Agreed that the worst part for me was freaking out! My anxiety was sky high the entire time.
Asthma,fr4n4c7,t3_gmjfuv,1589892619.0,"Posted about this in another thread, but I had COVID and I’m asthmatic. My asthma is typically very well controlled and mild (I usually just get it when I’m sick or when my allergies are bad). My childhood asthma was worse than what I’ve experienced in adulthood.

My symptoms were fairly mild but long lasting. It took me a solid month to fight the virus and then another month to recover. 2 months later, I’m still dealing with asthma being flared up, heart rate fluctuations, and feeling like my fitness level is at zero (I was fairly active before COVID). My allergies are also worse now that my immune system just fought a war so that could be why my recovery took a bit longer too. My current recovery is on par with recovery after pneumonia, though it was never confirmed I had it with COVID. If I did, it was milder than any pneumonia I’ve had in the past and mild enough that I didn’t realize I had it.

I did have to rely on my rescue inhaler quite a bit for a couple weeks while actively fighting COVID. However, while I think COVID flared up my normally under control asthma but I don’t think asthma made COVID worse, if that makes sense. I never needed to go to the hospital or ER. My breathing symptoms were honestly just asthma symptoms that I knew how to manage."
COVID19positive,fr2l1up,t3_gm37jv,1589839165.0,Yes!! I’m down to mild SOB that seems to be tied to acid reflux. I am asthmatic normally but I never had reflux like this before COVID. I’m also 2 months in. I thought I was going nuts. Definitely going to speak with my doctor about it tomorrow. Thank you for posting!
Asthma,fquq2vd,t3_gk1ht3,1589662843.0,"This is anecdotal, given it’s based on my personal experience with COVID. I’m asthmatic (on the milder side) and had COVID in March/April. Didn’t need to go to the hospital, but did end up having a longer recovery time and my asthma is still a bit worse than normal now 2 months later. Incidentally, my allergies are a lot worse after COVID which I’m chalking up to my immune system being shot after fighting this thing. However, I normally have asthma issues with any respiratory infection and when my allergies are bad. The short of it is that having asthma doesn’t seem like a death sentence with COVID but you probably want to make sure you have your inhaler on hand. :) I don’t feel like asthma made my case worse at all and it acted like it does whenever I get a respiratory infection."
COVID19positive,fqpm22j,t3_gk4kgv,1589549502.0,"I had viral bronchitis in February and then another 3 day cold in February. Got COVID in March. Mild lung symptoms during COVID - my lung symptoms during bronchitis were worse. This was actually surprising to me because I have asthma. However, I got stuck with a lingering case of COVID."
COVID19positive,fqnuab9,t3_gjtrk0,1589501531.0,"Yeah, my symptoms were mainly neurological and I also had major sinus issues. Tested positive and my antibody test was positive so I definitely had it. My first symptom was a really bad dizzy spell and I lost my sense of smell. I did have about a week of respiratory symptoms but it wasn’t the star of the show."

COVID19positive,fqn0rzc,t3_gjqdv5,1589486741.0,"I’m finally taking vitamins regularly and staying hydrated. I slacked so bad with my health & eating habits before getting COVID and being hyper aware of my body during a longer term case has really turned that around. I’ve started going for daily walks at the recommendation of my dr to help with recovery and I can’t remember when I last made a point to go on a daily walk! I KNOW I’ll come out of this experience healthier than I’ve been over the last year. 

Also like others have mentioned, being stuck in a tiny apartment with my boyfriend has deepened our relationship and made me 100% sure that he’s the right person for me!"
COVID19positive,fqmzrmk,t1_foicb8n,1589486255.0,Wanted to follow up here. I can now handle black tea without crazy heart rate spikes. This is from not being able to have a sip of anything caffeinated a few weeks ago. Thinking this might end up being an annoying but short term issue. Fingers crossed!
COVID19positive,fqmzd6i,t1_fqm6k10,1589486065.0,"This is also about where I am at around 8 weeks, except I’m still getting lightheadedness from time to time."
COVID19positive,fqmyemf,t3_gjmwxc,1589485608.0,"It’s worth it to check with your doctor. I saw my primary dr and a cardiologist about the same thing. Both think it’s due to post viral syndrome - basically my immune system is still reacting even though I’ve beaten the virus and there’s some lingering autonomic dysfunction as my body rights itself. I’m also getting random bouts of lightheadedness/dizziness. I will say that both recommended light exercise so I’ve been doing gentle walks daily. Yesterday & today I’m finally seeing my heart rate stabilizing a bit, even while walking. I’m coming up on 8 weeks since initial symptoms tomorrow."
COVID19positive,fqhrsr2,t3_gium2u,1589383135.0,"I have asthma (and allergies). I’ve recovered now (with the exception of post viral syndrome symptoms that I’ve posted about in other threads). I didn’t feel like having asthma was overly detrimental with my case. I did rely on my rescue inhaler daily at the height of it (prob for a span of 2 weeks) and I use my rescue inhaler now more frequently than I have in years. However, I found it overall manageable with the inhaler. In fact, I think having asthma & being prone to pneumonia/bronchitis over the years really helped my anxiety from getting out of hand because I know what it feels like to have issues breathing and I know when it’s serious enough to need to be treated with something other than my inhaler. 

I did have a longer case of covid (my non-asthma partner fought the virus in a week compared to my 3-4 weeks of actively fighting the virus) but unsure if that was related to the asthma. I did not get pneumonia to my knowledge, though I couldn’t get a chest X-ray because my symptoms didn’t warrant it.

I should note that despite having asthma, I’m generally active. I was a runner prior to getting COVID, though I had slacked a little in the months leading up to getting it. Not sure if that was helpful in keeping the asthma under control."
COVID19positive,fqhqd8m,t1_fqcs84k,1589382285.0,"Yep! Diagnosed with post viral syndrome by my primary care doctor. EKG & blood work normal. Saw a cardiologist and he confirmed it was likely post viral syndrome but is still having me wear a special heart monitor for a week to rule out anything else. 

For the record, both my Dr & the cardiologist recommended light exercise. I know this can be triggered by overdoing it, but I’m on week 7.5 now and daily light exercise (like a gentle walk or some light yoga) has started helping me. My resting heart rate is finally back in the normal range most days but I am still going a bit higher than normal when I move around at all. I do occasionally have high resting heart rate days but they are less & less now and I’ve noticed they seem to be triggered when I either take my allergy meds or I’m stressed out. My body’s reaction to stress seems to be enhanced."
COVID19positive,fqhgfxc,t1_fqh57z2,1589376465.0,It did work for me but I am thinking that’s because my sinus/ear infections were secondary bacterial infections after the viral infection. It did take until the last couple days for it to work (I was on a 14 day course). I do still have lingering sinus/ear issues but I’m pretty sure they are allergy related. I also took fluticasone prescription nasal spray the whole time and I think that helped as well.
COVID19positive,fqb73ep,t1_fqb1jfa,1589231729.0,Haha I was happy when mine seemed to return but now I’m annoyed with them again. :) I was on a round of z-pak & then a longer course of augmentin.
COVID19positive,fqb6zq0,t1_fqazs0c,1589231679.0,"Both of my ears had bad pressure & crackling and I ended up having a double ear infection that needed antibiotics. See my comment above for a more detailed explanation of if it was covid related or not - basically it occurred with my confirmed covid case but I suppose it could’ve been something happening alongside it as well. Not sure, but it was awful nonetheless and started when my covid symptoms started."
COVID19positive,fqb6n9p,t1_fqanr90,1589231507.0,"I’m not a Dr & I guess I honestly can’t fully confirm if the sinus/ear were due to covid, allergies, or just the overproduction of mucus from covid meeting my existing crappy sinus drainage that I’ve dealt with my whole life, ha. I did test positive for covid (and am positive for IgG antibodies now) and it all hit at the same time so it was lumped in with treating the rest of my symptoms. I also had total loss of sense of smell after an intense sinus burning episode about a week into covid symptoms."
COVID19positive,fqay1vs,t1_fqamrus,1589227249.0,"Yes, meclizine for the dizziness. To be fair, I was already on it for vertigo so I’ve always had a prescription."
COVID19positive,fqamzu0,t3_ghbdxv,1589221820.0,"Sinus/ear issues (and dizziness) were probably my worst and longest lasting symptoms of covid. I did two rounds of antibiotics and the last round seems to have gotten it, but Dr thinks I might still be dealing with some ear inflammation because I’m still not 100% with them. I’m still on prescription Flonase. Hands down worst sinus issues of my life. And now my allergies are back... :("
COVID19positive,fqaly9i,t3_ghoifk,1589221315.0,My temp was definitely lower than normal when I was battling covid. It actually raised at the tail end of it (around 3 weeks) to 99. It’s back to normal now at 7 weeks.
COVID19positive,fqajjk3,t1_fq7tshl,1589220143.0,My allergies definitely kicked in once I was in recovery after an absence of symptoms while actively dealing with covid. Week 7 here and my allergies are back in full force as of about 1.5-2 weeks ago.
COVID19positive,fqagi1p,t1_fq903bw,1589218675.0,"No real treatment. I have meclizine for the dizzy spells but otherwise I was told that my body is recovering so make sure it gets the nutrients it needs (and up my protein because my muscles are weaker now), hydrate/electrolytes, and try to start doing some light exercise. I have weekly check ins (video or via message if I’m feeling good) with my Dr so she can monitor. It should resolve over time and in all honesty, it has been very slowly getting better. On my bad days, I’m now more often having a few bad hours instead of being down for the count for days. I can handle walking for a couple miles without crashing the next day now as well."
COVID19positive,fq65hyj,t3_gh28sc,1589124904.0,"Dizziness was my first symptom and I’m still getting it at 7 weeks, though I’ve been told by the Dr that it’s post viral now."
COVID19positive,fq64rt5,t1_fq3fwqv,1589124480.0,"I asked my Dr during the appointment and she said according to the most recent guidance she’s been given, likely no longer contagious. However, she did say to take precautions as if I was (wearing a mask/social distancing) as they are getting new information all the time. She also said if I tested positive at this point, it’s probably just dead virus particles.

The short of it - probably not but nobody really knows for sure."
COVID19positive,fq20afr,t3_gghuet,1589051675.0,"For the record, I’m still not 100% at around 7 weeks (heart rate is a bit all over the place, lingering dizziness/lightheadedness, blood pressure fluctuations - most of this is triggered by too much activity). My blood work is back to normal at this point. My Dr said it’s likely post viral syndrome and it’s just going to take time for my body to get back on track. I’m in NYC and she said she has quite a few mild/moderate cases exhibiting the same lingering symptoms."

COVID19positive,fofh688,t3_g6ytl5,1587735797.0,8 days of complete loss of smell. Very gradual return and I’m about 90% back 3-4 weeks from initial loss of smell.
COVID19positive,foffbu0,t3_g6z05e,1587734619.0,"1. I felt recovered from the active part of the virus after about 2.5-3 weeks. Though I still was a little (mildly) up & down during week 4. I’m 5 weeks from initial symptoms now.
2. I think I’m recovered from the virus itself but I am on antibiotics for a secondary sinus infection so I’m not feeling 100%. My vision is a little blurrier than before I had the virus. Unsure if this will clear up or is permanent. My sense of smell is probably 90% back & again, unsure if this is what it is now. Like another comment, I’ve noticed a lingering sensitivity to caffeine. I can handle walks fine but when I try to do stronger cardio, I feel it for a day or two after. Very slow progress though!
3. Yes. I have mild asthma and had to rely on my inhaler for weeks 2-4. I no longer need it. I do still get the occasional rapid heart beat and chest tightness/dull pain but it’s gotten better this week. My dr said my chest was clear as of a week ago.
4. I could’ve been more active but I’m not overweight and am in generally good health. I did walk a considerable amount daily out of necessity given I live in a major city."
COVID19positive,fofduof,t1_foe1wud,1587733631.0,I’ve also noticed a sensitivity to caffeine and I’m a former multiple cups a day coffee drinker. Do you mind elaborating on the sensitivity? I swear my heart rate spikes/I feel weird with just a sip now.
COVID19positive,fo8ogxv,t3_g5n7vg,1587600605.0,I lost my sense of smell completely for 8 days and then it started gradually coming back. It’s close to fully back now and I’m around 3ish weeks from the day I lost it.
COVID19positive,fo8nnhi,t3_g5k3of,1587600138.0,"My energy level went back to almost normal around day 21 or so, however if I exert myself too much then I do get minor “relapses”. I’ve been off the inhaler for around a week and my vitals/blood work are now all normal as of day 33 (and my chest is clear!). Day 37 now and dealing with a stubborn secondary sinus infection and lingering blurred vision that will hopefully resolve when the sinuses resolve. I do still go up to 99 degrees temperature-wise but my dr said they are seeing this with many lingering mild cases (along with the intermittent chest pain)."
COVID19positive,fo7ph0f,t3_g55ha3,1587582295.0,"I’m officially at week 5 today. I think I was battling the actual virus for about 2.5 weeks but ended up going into the dr’s at 4.5 weeks for blood work/checking vitals due to still having some lingering symptoms. I do have a stubborn secondary sinus/ear infection now & am on antibiotics. Generally speaking - labs/vitals are good and I am honestly feeling much better than I did a few weeks ago (even with a couple minor setbacks and some lingering symptoms that may be due to the secondary infection). Dr said people are having the low grade fever, chest pains for weeks after battling the virus. I do notice symptoms increase if I exert myself."
COVID19positive,fnmideb,t3_g2lph0,1587071966.0,My breathing symptoms reared their ugly head around day 12 and stuck around until the end. I wasn’t really improving around day 21 & I ended up on a round of antibiotics for “potential” mild pneumonia (my dr didn’t have me come in the office for a chest X-ray due to my symptoms still being mild and the healthcare here being overloaded) and I honestly believe that took me over the recovered finish line.
COVID19positive,fnmhb11,t1_fnmf402,1587071418.0,I did up until about a week ago. That seems to have mostly resolved now (a little over a month since the start of symptoms) but I did have a slight issue a couple days ago after having video calls the entire work day.
COVID19positive,fnmh0gz,t3_g2fhy2,1587071268.0,"Yeah. I am a little over a month from initial symptoms and around a week & a half into being recovered (as in no new symptoms and the symptoms my dr said were just lingering are just about clear). I seem to be able to handle a gentle, short walk okay but I pushed myself with the cardio yesterday and almost fainted. Spent the night & morning with breathing issues, mild chest pain, & lightheadedness but it seems to be resolving now almost 24 hours later.

AskNYC,f5aykd7,t3_dn7hm6,1572115397.0,"Honestly? I’ve lived and dated in a couple cities after my divorce (and currently live in NYC). I really think it’s the same anywhere. The one benefit of NYC is sheer numbers. Try dealing with the same crap that comes with dating in a smaller city with way less single people. Because dating is truly the same crap everywhere - people ghost, you have great first dates that never go anywhere, etc. I lived in a small city for a little bit after my divorce and dated a guy that I met in person (not on an app!) who, guess what, couldn’t commit. Just like everyone’s gripe about dudes in NYC. 

I truly think it boils down to your own attitude and knowing what you want in a partner, which is surprisingly hard to figure out. If you’re miserable dating and going into dates with a negative attitude, then it’s going to show on the date. If you’re not clear on what you want and set dates with people who are not quite right, then realize they are never going to be quite right until you know what is right for you. Yes there are so many interesting people in NYC but you’re interesting too once you get to know yourself."

BipolarReddit,f48yaa7,t1_f48538m,1571452303.0,I have a very similar career in tech. The ability to work from home is what saves me from getting fired during my depressive episodes.

Mental illness is generally spoken about openly.
BipolarReddit,f48x05n,t1_f48vc76,1571451287.0,"I’ve been lucky that I’ve been able to hold down most of my jobs. I did purposely chose a specific work environment & career that plays better with my cycles, rewards more on my ideas, and allows remote working though. School was a disaster for me though. The only reason I graduated high school was because my English teacher said that even though I technically failed, she couldn’t in good conscience fail someone who produced such good work even if it was inconsistent. I am forever grateful to her because I did go on to graduate college afterwards (even though it took me double the time because I kept dropping out).

However my personal life has notoriously been difficult. Now that I’m older, I do have a few solid friends whom I have disappeared on for months and still stuck by me. They understand my illness the best they can and in turn, I’ve worked on communicating better when I am struggling.

Somewhat related but not quite paranoia... my phobias get really heightened. For example, thinking I’m going to die in the elevator I take every single day. I think the strangest one I can remember is that for about a month or so after my divorce, I was terrified to take the subway (which I rely on) because there were no bathrooms & I was terrified that I was going to have to go to the bathroom and not make it in time.

My mom has an anxiety disorder and she also wanted to see if I had one too since I would have “episodes” of anxiety ahead of depression. Turns out that was hypomania, along with a few other behaviors.

I can’t remember the specific assessment though, as this was over 20 years ago. I’ve never had a full blown mania episode so my diagnosis still runs true. My hypomania is relatively mild still to this day, but my depressions can get quite severe."

And when my illness flares up, I consider (and am willing to take) medication to control/get through the flare up, however long that may be. Just like I’d do for any other chronic illness.

3. I actually moved to NYC in my 30s and I’m honestly glad I waited until I had a good job lined up. I know there are many people who move here & figure it out when they get here, but I really feel like my experience was positively impacted by having a job lined up. Not just financially, but socially as well.

4. I love everything about living in this city! I also grew up within a couple hours of the city so I knew how to navigate/had friends here/etc when I originally moved. Current living situation - ditched the roommates & moved uptown."
