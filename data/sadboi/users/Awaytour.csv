relationship_advice,fq2spgu,t1_fq2qokh,1589059268.0,Dude I’m with you. Sometimes enough is enough. Its hard to explain to people. My mother was often like this. It manifested differently. It sucks to have to be the adult with your mom. She is asking you to bail her out after a bad decision. So i would explain it to her like she is a young adult why she is not getting what she wants.

I think we all fall victim to the belief that asking outright will be mortifying if the feelings aren’t reciprocated. It might be for awhile but it will work it self out. You may have a different relationship afterwards. More reserved but you will at least know. If your gut is telling you he digs you, don’t overthink it!"
