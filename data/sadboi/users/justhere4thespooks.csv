You’re not useless and what your parents are doing is dumb.
I hope you get out of there soon as you can because that sounds terrible to live with.
Try to tough it out for as long as you can. Its gonna be real hard and that’s what everyone says, but you’ll find somewhere where people think you’re great the way you are. Hold on for that.
Try to stay at friends houses a lot? Or talk to a school guidance counselor. It’s real hard, but I believe in you.

Sorry if none of this helped, but I really just wanna say that it won’t be this bad forever. It always feels like it will be, but it never is. I believe in you, man :)
P.s. if it gets real bad, link a go fund me and the bottom of this post or one like it and Reddit’s got your back man. 
Good luck!"

Paranormal,es9u49e,t1_es9chjo,1561744556.0,"I assume you’re close to Burke then? Because according to some articles, there is a cryptid/urban legend called the Bunny Man in that general area. I don’t know very much about him, and I’m suggesting this based simply on your location. Throughout 1970, two attacks occurred late at night in Burke. According to reported sightings, the man wore a white suit with long bunny ears. He swung a hatchet at citizens. Most to all sightings occurred in the month of October. I was the Stick Incident in October, I wonder? Some articles suggest that he returns on the night of Halloween to commemorate the night he supposedly died, but that sounds a bit strange to me.
If you want to continue walking your dog so late, I suggest you start a list of all the walks in which you felt the eeriness you explain in your post. 

Stay safe."
