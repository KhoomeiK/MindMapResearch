Your experience is yours. You are a trans man, but more importantly you are an individual. Your identity is yours alone, no matter what it is. And those who loved you before you came out as trans should love you the same because you've always been YOU, regardless of how you've expressed yourself."

I think there may be a genetic basis, but I think growing up with an emotionally distant, authoritarian was the major factor in the development of my BPD.

I never realized this until I saw how my mother is with my son. She tells me my child has no opinions, can't make choices, needs an authoritarian upbringing. Everything is black or white. She is the well-knowing authoriry. Children should be seen, not heard. Step out of line, you'll be punished, but she won't explain why, except to say, ""Because I said so.""

No affection towards me, or even modeling of affection with my dad. Just cold and strict. Mocking and shame for any interests or emotions I had. No allowing me to form a personality, it was all about falling into line. Personality: bad. Following orders: good. Be whoever everyone else wants you to be or you are not worthy of love."

BPD,fom3284,t1_fom0cpf,1587876955.0,"Again, the relationships are not the point.

If I hate myself but you love me, I still hate myself, but now I have a bandage."
BPD,folz7po,t1_folxzwz,1587874076.0,"Thing is, it's not, fundamentally, about relationships at all. Yes, that is where symptoms manifest, and it's truly great you can accept them, but....the disorder is of the individual. 

It's like, if my partner is an alcoholic, and I say, ""Well, don't worry about it, I love you anyway."" It's very kind and loving, but my partner is still destroying himself, and I'm letting him."

BPD,folx03v,t3_g7zixa,1587872512.0,"I get that your intentions are good with this post, but here's the thing:  

People with BPD hurt internally. We focus on the way others feel about us, but that is really unhealthy. Feeling good about ourselves because someone else approves of us is not the desired outcome. We really, really need to learn to love ourselves. We don't need a savior, though we think we do, and desperately seek them out.

If you make me happy because you ""understand"" and accept me, that's still YOU making me happy. My happiness is still conditional on outside forces. It is a band aid, and it can change at any minute, when I get irrational and moody and angry and you get tired of it and say, ""Enough!""

Because you have that self-respect and that ability to soothe yourself, rely on yourself. We don't. 

And when we've pushed you too far, you'll leave and we'll have reinforced, yet again, that even the most kind, understanding person we've ever met can't love us unconditionally because we are THAT terrible.

Thank you, but we ain't getting anywhere until we find love for ourselves within our selves."
BPD,foirmwb,t1_foir1p8,1587794797.0,"That's great advice! Like you, my mother is a primary reason for my BPD, and I living with her at the moment. The problem is, she won't LET me walk away. She insists I hear all the reasons why I'm horrible. She accuses me of avoiding the reality of how awful I am, and I just need to sit down and hear it."
BPD,foip9ng,t1_fofju5m,1587792743.0,"I feel this so much. It's a combination, that's what's so hard with us thinking in black and white. Yes, we tend to think in a disordered way, but sometimes people really ARE taking advantage. It's so confusing."
BPD,foip3ue,t1_fof1v0d,1587792604.0,"I find mindfulness very difficult, but I am trying. But I am around a lot of people who are very toxic to me, and it's hard to realize myself while constantly being told I'm ""bad."""
BPD,foioyu1,t1_fof1g0r,1587792483.0,"Thank you. Logically, I believe this. Emotionally, it's a whole nother story. My parents, to this day, are conditional in their love. If I'm ""good,"" they love and praise me. If I make a mistake I am awful and bad. I'm a fucking ADULT and still trying to make them just love ME, and it makes me feel like I'm still a child. Like, if my own parents want me to work for love, to prove myself worthy, how could anyone else love me for me? It's so fucked up."
BPD,foej6ex,t3_g70ov2,1587705159.0,"I do this to myself.

Honestly, my symptoms got worse after diagnosis. I used to just be myself and feel justified, now I second guess everything I feel, think, or say as a ""crazy person."" It's hard to stand up for myself when I am paranoid that I'm being crazy all the time."
