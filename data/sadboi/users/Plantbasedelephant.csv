infj,fql2y80,t1_fqiq3l0,1589444420.0,"Can you tell me more about ""ISFPs externalize all the emotion that we feel""? I am an INFJ and my partner is likely to be an ISFP (we are not quite sure) and I feel like I am draining him with my emotions."
depression_help,fn90a4o,t1_fn8zwx6,1586755280.0,I really think it's about developing a connection to oneself. When I can motivate myself to do yoga or meditation i feel so much better and calmer afterwards.
depression_help,fn8zwx6,t3_g0bvws,1586754961.0,I think I am tricking myself with watching YouTube videos. I am feeling very connected to some people I have been subscibed to for many years now. I came to this realization recently. It seems to help.
mbtimemes,fn8zaxv,t1_fn8xn2b,1586754443.0,"Those comparisons personally feel awful, but i know what you are trying to portray :D This black and white thing is scary sometimes, but it's hard to handle. I really thought this would predominantly be an internal process instead of being that obvious to others around. Apperently it's showing through."
mbtimemes,fn8x9c3,t3_g09chm,1586752748.0,It's funny how infj''s are depicted in this subreddit. I feel a little uncomfortable and honored at the same time :D
infj,fn8t8zv,t3_fzq9cd,1586749650.0,"I can relate! My experience with my mental health after the last breakup is so bad I have the feeling i wouldn' t stand another one. Even though we parted without conflict and everything is fine between us. I am just so sad about the fact we couldn't hold on to our partnership. I am crying so hard sometimes even two years after the breakup and being in a new, really beautiful relationship."

NarcissisticAbuse,fmqf0qt,t3_fwnwhp,1586298365.0,"That's a 100% my dad. Always saying he's having a tough life with his role of being brutally honest all the time. Always sharing his opinion without someone asking him. The next minute he ist lying about something random, very obviously."
bipolar,f8q72i2,t3_e1hf40,1574713131.0,"I feel you! I am questioning my diagnose (recurrent depressive disorder) because of countless phases i am doing the same; re-arranging the whole flat. Sometimes I don't know where the enormous energy comes from that I need in order to do this! Same with sports, baking, downsizing, tidying, cleaning etc.. I spent 1-3 days exessively on one activity and need twice as long to get my energy back."
depression,f8brnsz,t1_f8al33c,1574443754.0,It is the worst! Our 6 year relationship fell apart because we both couldn't handle ourselves. It felt as if he wasn't present anymore.
