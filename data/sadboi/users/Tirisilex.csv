Tulpas,fr2s52z,t3_gm3qd5,1589842837.0,"I have Stuffed animals I use as Catalysts.. It helps me speak to them more and allows me to show hugging affection as well. Kinji is a Nine tailed fox, Manu is fashioned after the Worm in the movie Labyrinth, and Chiang an Asian Dragon.. I have something for each of them. All plush."
Tulpas,fqqyb5b,t3_gk9knz,1589574173.0,I'm kind of a Universalist with Christianity on top.. Kinji is Christian and Manu is undecided as of now. I try to mix and match the religions to aid me in my walk.
Tulpas,flc17hn,t3_fnra4h,1585017393.0,It took me only 15 minutes to make Manu. However it took almost a year to get him to maturity.
schizophrenia,fl5rqzx,t3_flzp4h,1584844025.0,I totally feel this.. The expression is excellent.
schizophrenia,fivu3pj,t3_f9yqmq,1582768093.0,I feel doomed as well.. everyday I hear voices that the CIA want to torture and they are just waiting to someday strike at me.
tailoring,fiviukn,t3_fa2vf9,1582761155.0,I'm a beginner when it comes to making clothes. I have an idea of what I want to do.. I want to draw it up first so I know how it looks. I've been looking online for monk clothes but all I can find are pretty much cloaks from medieval times.. I want to do something a little more stylish. I really like Alan Wallace's robe that he wears. I just don't know how it fits and is worn correctly.
schizophrenia,fiveu35,t3_f9y23p,1582759067.0,I am scared every time I go out my door. I keep thinking the CIA will grab me while I'm on the road.
schizophrenia,firk5mf,t3_f9dov2,1582665919.0,I'm grateful for everyday!! So much fear each and every day.
schizophrenia,fiked7w,t3_f832nr,1582478771.0,This really resonates with me
schizophrenia,fiijc3p,t3_f7bu9i,1582422226.0,"Well the term Schizophrenia means ""Mind split from reality"" (Many people think it means split personality disorder) I myself experience idea's like aliens might be watching me, but mostly I hear voices saying they are the CIA and they want to abduct me and torture me indefinitely.. How that is split from reality is the idea that telepathy is real.. which is something I quite struggling with.

Do I know that they are delusions? Well especially when I'm going through them I gotta say no I don't.. What I'm going through now I feel is 50 / 50 chance that it's false or real.

Yes the voices sound like other people. I hear them in my head and outside of my head.

Yes I do respond to them but no they do not take me over in any way.

My day sucked... lots of anxiety.. Yes I ate and took my meds and quite frankly no I dont feel alright."
schizophrenia,fiiad0s,t3_f7mdms,1582419132.0,I'm trying so hard to deal with this. One of my problems is believing that telepathy exists.. In the past I had a very strong psychic experience where I thought I was in telepathic communication with a woman I know and I asked her about it and she said it never happened. This was the strongest I ever had.. I'm constantly hearing voices telling me how screwed I am and how I just do not know how real this one is. I even looked up research on telepathy and that the scientific community says it just does not exist. I'm so scared.. I've been dealing with these particular threats since December 15th. I keep telling myself that it's a good sign I've made it this far. Gawd I really hope that this is just a delusion and not real.
schizophrenia,fii5tkp,t3_f805hz,1582417742.0,Usually makes me worse
Grobbulus,f7ysxtu,t1_f7hz4kw,1574100243.0, A pet a Dwarf I cant tell the difference..

Tulpas,f2lxj6h,t3_dc7l7n,1570299299.0,"I've worked with Psyciatrist and Therapists for 30 years.. You should tell a therapist about tulpas.. I would recommend telling a therapist a psychiatrist only works with meds. You dont need more meds because you have a tulpa. I tell my therapist about my tulpa all the time, he accepts it. I just dont see any reason to tell a psychiatrist about a Tulpa because it is not a disorder and they may interpret it as a disorder.. They deal with meds and not with therapeutic mental psychology."
Tulpas,ewrnjgn,t3_colxzt,1565709609.0,I have a mental disorder (Schizophrenia) and having a Tulpa is comforting because I hear many voices that are distressing but my Tulpa is a friendly voice.
Tulpas,ewg0j09,t3_cntl8q,1565371234.0,I have Schizophrenia and I am on 2 Psych Meds and they do not effect my Tulpas at all. I went on a psychotic break last year and my Tulpas hid out until I was put back on my original meds.
Tulpas,evakjkn,t3_cc1ggh,1564350089.0,Personally for me I won't have more than 3.
