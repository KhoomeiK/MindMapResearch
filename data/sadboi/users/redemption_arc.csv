BPDmemes,fr2p1k7,t1_fr2of7q,1589841198.0,"I’m sorry you’ve received mean replies. Yes, on this sub and commonly in the psych world the acronym BPD is known as Borderline Personality Disorder. Bipolar Disorder is generally accepted to be shortened to BP (more specifically, BP1 for Bipolar Disorder Type 1 or BP2 for Bipolar Disorder Type 2). BP is often confused with BPD, not only because people accidentally shorten BP to BPD instead, but also because both mental illnesses share many of the same symptoms; however, they are NOT the same condition, not everyone who has one has the other, they are not treated with the same treatments (although there are medication and therapy crossovers), and symptoms of both manifest differently. I hope this helps clarify things for you!"

Possibly even the fire department or animal control, if necessary. Regarding the lights, they don’t need to have them on to develop their eyesight and are actually more comfortable in the dark so it may be best to leave the lights off. Glass wool is very toxic for both humans and animals to have such direct contact with so they should be removed from it immediately.

Yes, to an average person it would likely be hurtful to find out that your partner had slept with your friend before you had met them simply based on the fragility of the human ego (and there’s nothing wrong with acknowledging that as long as you don’t obsess over it!), but it should not be something that would land both of you in jail over it. We know that Jenelle’s world has much different standards, though. I do have to give Gary credit for at least attempting to explain what happened and have a conversation with her in an open, honest, mature, and reasonable way at first and in hoping that Jenelle would be more understanding about it. It’s not like he cheated or lied while they were together so I can see why he shouldn’t have had sleeping with Tori held against him or at the very least why she could have forgiven him for it.

I was honestly shocked because I think Gary is currently a really good guy, despite his giant flaw of enabling Amber’s awful behavior. Him pushing her first in that scene almost 10 years ago in no way negates, relieves, or excuses Amber of any of her abusive and violent behavior toward anyone since then. It is interesting, though, that Gary’s actions there are not mentioned on this sub at all and he is often praised for putting up with Amber’s abuse toward him only. Yes, people make mistakes and people change, but him pushing Amber and anything else he’s done similarly should not be ignored. It’s important to acknowledge that they were both abusive back then. We know Amber hasn’t changed. Hopefully Gary actually has."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqmaupc,t3_gjkasj,1589474403.0,"So I based my answer off of who I have any hobbies in-common with (so I wouldn’t be bored) and who I would probably get along with best (so I wouldn’t be lonely). Out of of all the people listed, the only person I really feel like I personally could do any fun activities with is Catelynn. I enjoy crafts and I love animals, so I figure that we can scrapbook and spend time with horses. We both see animals as therapeutic. Her and I both had crappy parents growing up, so I think we can talk about that. We can probably relate when it comes to depression and codependent relationships. We both have issues in taking care of others before ourselves. With all this said, we definitely have some differences as well, but overall I think her and I have the most in-common. HOWEVER, I am pretty confident that Jenelle, Ryan, and I would not get along at all no matter how hard I tried to be cordial toward them. So they would probably be somewhere else in our quarantine house “definitely not” doing a shitton of drugs together.  Also, I don’t like the choice of house at all - I wouldn’t feel comfortable in a fancy mansion lol. I’d rather be in the cabin or beach house or anywhere surrounded by nature. 

TLDR: I chose Catelynn/Jenelle/Rhine/Mansion only because Catelynn and I have shared hobbies (crafts and animals) and we would be able to get along (self-sacrificing and understanding) and relate to each other the most (shitty families and depression)"

Yes, there’s no doubt that these are cute, but at that price wouldn’t just one of the animal drawings have sufficed? I’m sure other retailers sell even better artwork for not insane amounts of money. Or maybe Idk...get off tik tok and make them yourself with your other three children? How cute would it be to hang your other kids’ artwork in the new baby’s room instead of some random expensive mass-produced stuff you bought online! I hope the kid still likes black and white giraffe and elephant baby room wall art when he’s 16 cause she will be so broke by then she won’t be able to afford to replace them with more junk."
BPDmemes,fqknk7b,t1_fqjlp6k,1589431384.0,"Right now I’m a dog walker and pet sitter. I am also a certified dog trainer. I’ve previously worked in animal hospitals, veterinary rehabilitation centers, and animal shelters, as well. As a social worker, I did a lot of work in animal-assisted therapy and emotional support animals. I created a program at a domestic violence clinic for animal survivors which complimented the clinic’s services for human survivors, as it focused on reuniting the people and their pets once the people had found stable housing and everything. That is awesome that you want to work with animals! My best advice is to start exploring which branch you want to get into. Do you want to work on the medical side of things as a vet or vet tech, open up a sanctuary or work at a rescue, be an animal control officer, do research into preventing wildlife extinction, assist in breeding zoo animals, work on a farm, or something else? What kinds of animals do you want to work with? There are so many options. Is volunteering at a local animal rescue an option (not sure on your location but assuming you live somewhere where the pandemic continues to dictate we stay-at-home as the “better safe than sorry” way to go so, although traditional in-person volunteer work may be limited right now you can still reach-out to shelters and rescues to see what you can do to help)? I first got started working with animals as a child volunteering with different organizations. By volunteering you can start really getting to know a lot about working with animals - depending on where you are at, you may learn about nutrition, observe spay and neuter surgeries, begin to be able to identify different breeds of dogs, start to understand the tools needed to groom a horse, etc. Starting with volunteer work is my best advice.

But deep down there’s still that nagging feeling and those thoughts that keep popping up telling me to stop making the right choices and go back to making the wrong ones like trying to apologize and beg those people to come back into my life even though they are the ones who wronged me. That’s the problem with BPD - those awful, obsessive thoughts that come back to haunt us telling us to do things we rationally don’t want to do and don’t think are right but emotionally say, “YEAH YOU NEED TO DO THIS TO FEEL GOOD BECAUSE YOU ARE BAD”, then we get rejected again just end up feeling much worse. And if we listen then the cycle restarts. But sometimes I have fortunately been able to be like, “yeah, no, fuck that asshole.

I love when they get super excited at bookshelves, doors, walls, mirrors, and other inanimate objects and get all poofy and stand there babbling trying to intimidate it but they just look so silly and cute! Nora likes to stand in front of the kitchen cabinet doors and wait for me to open them so he can charge up for battle!"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpycsxp,t1_fpxjzsb,1589001473.0,"No hate here. I agree with you. There’s just a lot of factors - from potential health risks to the baby to navigating difficulties in co-parenting with a new partner in the picture to the weirdness of explaining the situation to others in social settings - that just sound easier, smarter, and generally better for mom and baby to completely avoid by remaining single throughout pregnancy. I think it’s important to focus less on dating/sex right now out of mom’s selfishness for wanting those things, and to just focus more on current pregnancy/planning for the child’s future as mom understands the need to sacrifice some short-term bodily pleasures (sex life, drinking, drugs) to ensure that the baby develops to the best of their ability. After baby’s out, do whatever as long as the kid is well-taken care of."
RiotFest,fpy9npp,t3_gg520b,1588999166.0,The imagery is great! And it worked in his favor that the album title describes our current situation even more perfectly than it did 15 years ago so he didn’t even need to come up with something witty to change it to!
RoverPetSitting,fpy2x3a,t3_gg68we,1588994845.0,"My thought is to first schedule a Meet and Greet with the potential client and go from there. These are the questions I would gather answers to:

Are any of the pets experiencing any special needs or have any disabilities? Do any of the pets need individual extra attention that goes beyond standard care? Are all of the cats on the same feeding regimen / all of the dogs on the same feeding regimen? Do any of the animals not get along? Do any of the pets have severe behavior issues (ie. aggression, separation anxiety)? Are all of them housebroken? Are any of them on medication/have major health issues? What exactly does the family expect you to do - feed/backyard outs/litter boxes/take in mail/generally checking that all pets and house are okay, OR is there a lot more they need for you to take care of? Another factor that I would consider would be how reachable they, their emergency contact, and their vet will be while they are gone. 


In my opinion, keeping the aforementioned things in-mind would help determine if I could honestly offer to meet them where they are at at $50, ask if they would be willing to meet somewhere in the middle (say, at $75), stick to your price at $86, or insist that you actually would have to charge them more than that based on certain factors that would necessitate so. Essentially if the pet care needs and the household tasks are overall low-maintenance, if you’re willing to lower your price maybe consider negotiating with them to meet in the middle. However, if during the Meet and Greet you discover that their expectations go way above and beyond what any reasonable pet sitter in any area would be willing to do for even one pet for one overnight job for $50 - well, it seems like you have the common sense to politely decline that booking request if they are unwilling to see reason! I would get to know what exactly they are looking for content-wise, then use your best judgment. 🙂"

If you stop taking responsibility for your actions, you stumble even worse and end up in situations such as Amber’s (although us non-celebrities actually face consequences for bad choices we make). And hey, keep at it. I mess up, too, but we got this."

When I do not do at least some of these things consistently, although I do not exhibit the same exact symptoms as Amber, I become highly BPD symptomatic in other ways and become a danger to both myself and others."

Not knowing what to name your 4th child on-the-way during an age of abundant family planning measures at your disposal,  plus the fact that you’re wealthy and have education and access to ALL of them is, in comparison, quite orderly, systematic, calm, normal, and quiet - all the opposite of chaos."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpucvtc,t3_gfjiuq,1588909832.0,"Gary and Kristina are helping pilot a new program called “Adopt-an-Amber” where fairly normal, decently functioning families adopt an Amber who has no medically verified cognitive disorders, developmental delays, or TBIs, but these Ambers may qualify to be adopted by such families if they have been diagnosed with a severe mental illness, are probably not receiving appropriate treatment, have a documented history of poor decision-making skills, do not take responsibility for their actions, and likely have the potential to be high-functioning yet instead choose to manipulate others into believing they are lower-functioning than they really are, causing the people that feel obligated to be in their life to treat them as if they are truly a low-functioning Amber with an uncontrollable SMI thus enabling continued inappropriate behavior from the Amber-in-question and causing a permanent reliability on others to take care of them."
