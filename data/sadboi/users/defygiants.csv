I'm glad to hear others have this issue also as it makes me feel like less of an basket case!!"
confidence,fj19xo6,t3_fau5cj,1582915687.0,"Agreed with the above statements whole heatedly!!
Take care of yourself first and do the things that you can control such as
-- get and stay in shape
-- always be well groomed
-- wear nice clothes that are in style and clean and if you cannot afford new check out the local thrift store.
After feeling better about yourself you will find it easier to start and hold a conversation gaurenteed."

It's kind of refreshing to hear that I'm not the only one who this happens to."

Stoicism,f4c9654,t3_dka89d,1571526082.0,"Very well written and useful blog post.
You have offered up very good advice and I will refer back to this often. I have struggled with being betayed more than once and the jealousy and anger consumed me for many years after the fact."
mentalhealth,f2naw7p,t3_ddsy9a,1570313846.0,"Love your willingness to help others with this issue.
I also have been looking for ways to volunteer with helping out with the suicide problem but have been unable to find an organization where I could be of use.
Keep looking as will I .."

I had this exact same thing happen to me but like a fool I took her back only to have it happen again.
You will never be able to trust this woman again no matter what she says."

selfimprovement,exdfg95,t3_cs8s7r,1566175225.0,Wow!! This is just what I needed to hear lately. I honestly thought that I was the only one that did this to myself..
socialskills,evzg6zq,t3_cm2a3g,1564956812.0,"Wow, that is a sad story and I hope you all the best. I too have no self confidence and am a self described scatter brain so I can't offer much good advice. Having said that I would take it slow and easy and not try to make up for lost time in the process.
If you ever need someone to chat with feel free to pm me.
Good luck to you ."

After that is done you don't have to stress about things like this as I am now not allowing fake friends to have any say in my opinions.."

Thanks for stopping and checking on the truck driver."
mentalhealth,eqqc25v,t3_bz50f3,1560217561.0,"Hello, I have social anxiety also and can easily relate to your post. As hard as it can be you need to put yourself ""out there"" as good friends are hard to find in the first place you definitely won't find them if you have ear buds in at the coffee shop. Go to the meet ups or other social gathering and force yourself to strike up a conversation with someone. Sooner or later you will find someone you ""click"" with and he/she will introduce you to their friend's and you will be in your way.."
mentalhealth,eqkmcwb,t1_eqkj1rz,1560126403.0,"Wow !! Great advice. I'll be reading this over many times as it feels like it was written just for me.

Thank you.."
mentalhealth,epzvn65,t3_bwrkpo,1559673526.0,If you are not ready then please wait till you are. As the other poster stated if this guy really likes you he will understand your anxiety otherwise he just wants to have sex with you and that's it.
