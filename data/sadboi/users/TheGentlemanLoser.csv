Truthfully the biggest fuckup companies like newspapers did was build an online presence during a time before the transition thinking it was a novelty.  And then when it eroded their physical sales, they were shocked at the backlash they faced when they tried (badly) to put things behind paywalls.  TV news, who really cares about what the morning show as most people might have it on in the background (I usually click on KATC, especially once Tracy Wirtz left), but I'm paying very little mind to it.  Or I can use my home hub to play a routine that includes audio of select katc stories (which in the morning is all I need as I rarely am looking at the screen anyway).  

With that said, I do feel that those doing the work deserve to get paid (I know i've submitted a DMCA request over a small town snagging a photo without permission), and with the local population of ignorant and proud dotardites, they take a ridiculous amount of abuse because gawd forbid they aren't told what they want to hear.  But the reality is for most people, this area is a pit stop to gain experience before going to what they see as a better market.

I mean, the area sometimes has a behind the times feel with news stations that refused to update their look and when they did, somehow thought they were with the times by resurrecting the early 90's with ""Multimedia"" as their slogan."
