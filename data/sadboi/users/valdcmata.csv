Hang in there."

loseit,f0kqby5,t3_d54iii,1568685373.0,"Good luck! You can totally do this :).
Small changes first! Less sugar to very little sugar. More veggies (think in terms of MORE and no less, i.e: more water, more vegetables, more fruit (dont go overboard with the fruit though) more lean meats. I find that thinking in those terms helps not feeling deprived.)
Do exercises you enjoy, dont go crazy, you could end up injuring yourself."

fuckeatingdisorders,ezbjnec,t3_d0lwtg,1567821369.0,I think your brain is telling you you failed and thats why you feel miserable. I restrict and feel like shit being hungry but when i give in and eat a treat or something i feel weak and supid.
bulimia,eza08rb,t3_d0jbqv,1567792711.0,"What i did was not deprive myself of anything and not try to lose weight at fIrst. Eat lots of legumes, protein, eggs, whole grain rice, quinoa, etc. Snack on whatever you like as long is not triggering food. Eat as much as you want but make it your goal not to be too full. Avoid feeling uncomfortable. Kniw you can est whatever whenever you want to. Sure wsy not to binge.  It worked for me i swear"
