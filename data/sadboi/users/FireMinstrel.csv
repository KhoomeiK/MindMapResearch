It's like in America with the huge emphasis on school athletics.  The star pitcher or quarterback or whatever the best basketball player is, will be treated like a god as well, especially if they lead the team to all kinds of championships and victories.  Then when they get bored with that, they might take to mistreating some of their fellow students.  But at this point, they can do no wrong, so the adults all look the other way.

Without the Death Note, I could imagine Light becoming a crooked cop, but people like Matsuda would likely look the other way because of his impressive success rate.

Vivitrol is great, but it's hard-won, as you have to endure some kind of withdrawal first, whether it's a taper or cold-turkey.
