Femslash, one shot.Tifa visits a massage parlor.

Tifa returns to cleaning the glass, her tone disinterested. ‚ÄúAnd why are you telling me this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Jessie scoffed. ‚ÄúBecause you're always so damn tense. You're either training or locking yourself in here. You need to live girl.‚Äù She looks down into her drink. ‚ÄúI mean, when was the last time you got laid?""

Tifa stiffens. She sets the glass in her hand down roughly causing it to shatter. ‚ÄúThat's none of your business Jessie!‚Äù

Jessie back ups defensively. ‚ÄúWoah chill! I'm just trying to help...‚Äù

Tifa steadies her breathing. Around the room, there are a few people staring. She forces a smile before yelling out that all is well. Tifa looks down at her hand. There are small cuts from the glass along her inner fingers.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù Tifa says while cradling her hand and moves over to a drawer with a first aide kit. As she treats her wound, Jessie slides around the bar. Her face scrunches up sadly before she reaches into her pocket. ‚ÄúI didn't mean to upset you.‚Äù

Jessie rests a card on the counter before turning away. ‚ÄúJust check it out. You might enjoy yourself.‚Äù

Tifa continued to focus on her cuts. She doesn't look over to the card, until she hears Jessie exit.
She lifts the card off the counter and looks over it. There are two numbers and an address. The card went into her pocket and ignored for the rest of the night.

The bar stayed open for a few more hours. Tifa waved goodbye to the last group and walked them out. After locking the doors, she leans back against them. Closing is often the worst part of the day for her. The conversations and laughter give her life. Now, only an eery silence remains. She walked over to the phone on her wall, hovering there for awhile. Tifa chewed her lip. She pulled out the card, dialing the first number. Her confidence in this decision faltering as each ring went off. On the fourth ring, a feminine voice answers.

Tifa inhaled sharply in disbelief. She really didn't think anyone would answer.

‚ÄúUh, do you work for Miss M?‚Äù

There is a long pause that causes Tifa to wonder if Jessie is pulling a prank.

‚ÄúYes, who am I speaking to?‚Äù

Tifa bites her lip. The last thing she wants is for word to get out that she's calling such a person. ‚ÄúI - I know Jessie. She said she saw you recently.‚Äù

The woman on the other end laughed lightly. ‚ÄúOh Jessie! So you want the same service?‚Äù

Tifa clutched the phone tightly, an odd feeling twisting in her stomach. ‚ÄúWhat exactly did she get?‚Äù

She can hear shuffling around on the other side before the woman continues. ‚ÄúFull body, aromatherapy, and a bit extra. We can go over that more once you're here.‚Äù

Does she really want to do this? It's not like she has to do any weird happy ending stuff, and one time wouldn't hurt. Tifa agreed and she went over the price. Ten thousand gil, but she gets a discount of five thousand for being recommended. They agreed to meet tomorrow, near midnight."
