Imagine all the experiences and youth she has to experience! Imagine the chalenges and the struggles thatll form her and her soul and all the moments she has yet to live. Life is something wonderful, an abstract concept, and she has plenty of it. I wish her lots of joy, hugs from the dear ones and wonderful memories. I wish her walks in the woods, plenty of sunshine, courage and spirit."

Also, you can introduce a non straight fella of yours to him if you have one. If he talk about it, ask him if its ok of you ask questions. Don't act like he is straight, he will jist feel like you are denying him. He could be straight but just enjoy gay porn..."
