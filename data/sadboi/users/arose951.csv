mentalhealth,f4jvziv,t1_f30t1z3,1571627326.0,"Well, after trying to kill myself and ending up in the hospital I finally got help. I started meds and therapy. That was really just the start though. It's taken me years to realize a lot about myself. I quit hanging out with toxic friends and quit drinking so much and quit smoking weed and cigarettes. I've been completely sober for two months. But after meds it feels like the urge to burn and cut went away gradually. I still think about it though of course. Like on a bad day a 'let's resort to my old friend that knows how to relieve your pain' without anyone needing to know kind of feeling. Idk"

Marriage,f10u097,t3_d7fdyy,1569117278.0,"So, sex workers are normal. And they deserve to be paid for their work. If she asks for a picture of her customer, that is her preference and that is not neccesarily wrong. If your husband sends it knowing it will make you uncomfortable that is wrong. People in porn videos get paid, so people who sale pictures and other services like videos online should get paid. It's not their fault your husband is doing this, it's your husband's."

MaliciousCompliance,f0kokj6,t1_f05n52x,1568684115.0,Like I have worked for an isp/tsp but most of my contact center career has not been in that field and has had literally nothing to do with any of that. Like how does it make a person bad that customers literally have to call in for services sometimes. Without the option to call in or email you would have to get up and take your lazy ass to the store everytime you need to get something you need done lol

I know my great grandma doesn't remember me, and I've came to accept that. She doesn't remember my name, let alone that I'm her grandchild. 
Last time I saw her, she asked me if her daughter was in the other room calling the police on her lol. I had to tell her no, no one is calling the police. She asked me where I'm from, as if she was meeting me for the first time. Pointed to my mother and great aunt and told me that's her family sitting on the couch. And told me her daughters (great aunt and grandma) would love me. 
At one point she pointed to the ground and said ""could you make those things down there go away and be quiet"" 
I said of course and she thanked me. 
She'll point outside and say ""look at (sons name who died) out there"" , call all the animals in the house by her one dog's name lol"

oneanddone,eypomdo,t1_etofuzd,1567306296.0,"No. If siblings are closer together in age they are closer. Growing up did you typically hang out with, say, a senior in high school while you were in 5th grade? No. You probably had 5th grade friends. That's why.

MomForAMinute,exdlbin,t3_cs483b,1566179727.0,"This sounds like what I went through growing up. Except for my parents were divorced. 
I would advise to make sure you're surrounding yourself with positive people always. Look for an adult role model or mentor such as a teacher or guidence counselor as someone mentioned. 
Goodwill used to offer free therapists you can talk to, they might still offer that service. That could help a lot and you could see what other services they have such as adult education classes that would teach you the basics of finances and resumes. 
My parents never taught me any of that type of stuff either."

Like she changed her middle name to her maiden name when she got married and changed last name to FIL's last name. 
Gave FDH a hyphenated last name of her maiden name and FIL's last name. 
And I'm supposed to take that last name. Um if anyone's maiden name is in my last name it's MINE. lol 
I didn't realize there were so many situations similar to mine out there."
JUSTNOMIL,evuuylj,t3_cl3pqm,1564807240.0,"This is the post I've been looking for. I've been having somewhat of a last name crisis myself. FMIL legally changed her middle name to her maiden name when she got married, instead of just hyphenating maiden name and FIL's last name. So her name would read ""Jane doe Smith"" instead of ""Jane Anne Doe-Smith"" for example. 
They gave my FDH a hyphenated last name instead of FIL'S last name. 
Her last name isn't even hyphenated. No one's is but FDH. 
I am expected to take the hyphenated last name of mil's maiden name and fil's name when we marry. 
I have told FDH I am not comfortable with taking another woman's maiden name and he seems to be coming to terms with it, but I feel like she would take it the wrong way."
