I have OCD too so I put them away safely and only used them when I wanted it needed to cut. When those got dull, at the point people knew about the cutting it made it nearly impossible to get anything if i wasn’t alone. I would also put it off because I thought I’m crazy let me not get this right now, it can wait. Last week I finally said screw it I really want that exacto knife. I didn’t expect it to be as sharp.

When he left me I remember him spitting on my face, throwing hot water at me, pushing and shoving me the day he broke up with me. If he didn’t leave me I would have stayed taking more and more abuse because I didn’t know any better. 

His supply and him are living without any actual responsibilities. The kids visit him on the weekends other than that, he doesn’t get involved besides that. Makes me believe that they only bond over hating me and being vindictive. she has no kids and she loves over here from another state so she doesn’t really have anyone here but him and his parents. 

A while back I had to go to court to file a harassment order because she thought that it would be a good idea to contact me from five different numbers to talk nasty to me call me lazy, psycho, bad mother, tell me I was spewing lies to anyone who will listen and that I didn’t deserve to get called on Mother’s Day or that I shouldn’t feel entitled just because i have birth etc. etc. the judge didn’t grant me the order because it wasn’t “unsafe” BUT he did warn her that she was to not get involved and that if she contacted me ever again he would personally file a stay away order whenever the kids visited him on the weekends. She doesn’t get the point. He sternly in a full court told her you have no business interfering. Her response to the judge “I was simply supporting my significant other like she does when she brings her significant other to court”. She is constantly trying to mother my kids. 

During the phone call yesterday, she inserted herself in the conversation saying to my kids who are ages 10 and 7, “there’s a court order and she needs to respect it” and my daughter said mommy doesn’t like when she talks in the background. He says to her “well we can always get what we want, well we can but I’m not gonna do that” meaning he could
Take the kids away from me if he wanted to but won’t because of me. I actually recorded that part and send the video to my daughters therapist."

I wanna make it clear that I have made mistakes in the past of reacting to everything he said because I’d get scared and I’d end up arguing. That is no longer me anymore. For the past two years since he got with his new supply. I have been educating myself and going to therapy and talking to therapists that come into my home and told them everything, enough to know that I need to not react to him because it is honestly like munchies to him. He lives for it. She also lives for it. His supply is just as evil as he is. I do not contact him for anything unless I really need to and that has become less and less.

I don’t understand why he had to be cold or short with me or not give me a reply at all.

Straight up assault and battery but because she’s my mother I didn’t file a police report but the evidence is there and I had bruises and scratches and even a bite mark from my very own mother. At the time my sister said it didn’t matter because she is still my mother. These people think it’s okay to get treated the way you’re treated because of the simple fact that hey are family. Family is toxic and family can also be the reason why you deal with whatever it is you’re dealing with internally.

I remember my kids father would clear his throat literally all of the time and sometimes I’m like is it necessary? Do you HAVE to do this multiple times a day everyday? Maybe like the attention? Honestly I’m curious now. 

When theyre alone I bet they’re peaceful creatures doing their scheming quietly? Maybe? I know that if I mentioned something about it, I’d have no sympathy for them because they’re sick. Has anyone else noticed that they are big babies too?"

I’ve experienced this too, my kids father the Narc, would put me down so subtly that I wouldn’t even notice. Once, he was gonna get rid of a kettle bell he had but since I had just started working out I asked if I could have it and he says to me “yes it’ll work wonders for you, you’ll need it for your bla bla muscles” referring to my having a flat butt. And I remember at one point, he even sent me a shirtless photo of himself showing me his weight loss progress. I believe he had been hoovering me because he didn’t have anyone to talk to. As for the recent Narc, he told me I was a fat ugly cunt and yet to this day he is begging me to come back and give him a chance. So it’s like if you want me so bad why is it so easy for you to insult me the way you do and then expect for it to be forgiven?"

She even once threatened to suck his cock every time I acted psycho, her exact words too.  I wonder what it’s like being with two narcissists though, I read that they can feed off each other and that it could very well be a successful relationship BUT wouldn’t it get bad seeing as they both require attention and adoration 24/7?"
NarcissisticAbuse,ff8w24u,t3_esbbin,1579697999.0,"Yup, I went through something similar. The Narc I was with worked the night shift and we shared a room our kids and him because we never got an apartment while we were together. So if he needed sleep before work we had to try to be very quiet. Mind you my kids were little. Imagine trying to keep two kids quiet during the day when they are full of energy. So yeah it feels like we have to respect the king while he sleeps because the poor guy works graveyard shift while everyone is sleeping. My Narc would cough too or  clear his throat a lot and sometimes it seemed forced too. Like he wanted to be annoying on purpose."

It’s been like this for about three or four months. He’ll also asks the kids what they had for dinner and make comments about how thats too much dairy or hell sarcastically say things that “oh that’s healthy!” His gf is twice as big as me and does not have children or any experience with making dinner and now he either caters to her or vice versa and he brags about how he goes on long road trips just to pick up vegan dinner for him and her. Of course my kids will thinks it’s so cool. They’re little ages 7 and 10.  He buys their love. Sucks that I have to put up with them two now.

About two years later I get with a second Narc but our relationship lasted a year I’ve or take and trying to move on from that one but it’s hard considering we had an apartment together and I just started packing everything but again everything in my life makes sense now. I was raised by a narcissist, met one and had kids with him and then after the discard, met another one. I don’t want to go through it again and again.

I mean he’s doing a lot of what I begged him to do with me some he did but some it would take a miracle to get him to do anything. 

The way he said it on the phone though, it echoed in my ears. “She has A LOT of friends”. It’s like eventually they will see you for who you really are years from now or maybe sooner. 

With each victim they get better and they’re still in the love bomb stage in June it’ll be 2 years, why do i know this? Because it’s been hell since he met the new supply off tinder and I’m just still learning how to deal with two narcissist because she seems like a narc too just the way that she acts and something about her eyes gives it away."

Little Do they know he’s been a drug addict for about six years, abused me mentally and physically for almost 9 and never planned to do anything with us unless we begged, he LOVED eating steak and now because of a Netflix documentary called “what the health” he HATES meat now.

You me think about me is that I overshare and I learned that about myself recently when I told
My therapist. I don’t like to lie and I’m not very good at it. Maybe that’s why it’s so hard to tel when someone’s lying to me and why I’m so easily manipulated."
NarcissisticAbuse,feewys7,t1_feew4qf,1579043020.0,Not to mention that he has also told me many times before that if he wanted to he could have anybody in drop of some or whatever. He’s also said that he doesn’t have to deal with me and that he’s giving us a chance because he truly believes I’m the love of his life and he wants to make amends cause he treated me so poorly. That I need to understand that it wasn’t him that it was the drugs but idk because even when he was clean before right when I met him at the very beginning I always felt like he was love bombing me and he said I wasn’t used to feeling loved or some bullshit.
NarcissisticAbuse,feeuxgq,t1_feerfkb,1579041754.0,I forgot to mentioned he’s also cheated. I’m not sure that he’s fucked anyone else but he’s definitely spoken to a ton of other women behind my back. And I have al the screenshots of it. I’m scared to file a restraining order because somehow I still find myself wanting to talk to him and feeling guilty but he has actually made me feel like absolute shit and done horrible things to me even though he’s never lied a hand on me. But I just cannot handle anymore of this. This is the second abusive relationship I have and this time it happened in one year unlike my kids father that it lasted 9 years.
NarcissisticAbuse,f6d45p3,t1_f6col0u,1572791204.0,"This is so hard. I had to call my Nex just so he could be on stand by I didn’t give him any details but I told him to pick up the girls in case he found out I looked at his cellphone and decided to start fighting. He has already broken up with me several times so I know he’ll tell me to leave because he can’t handle my drama. I’m drama to him. So to be safe than sorry, I don’t want the kids to see or hear anything. I know it’s crazy that I would even consider asking my Nex for help because this is literally ammunition for him but you know how was I supposed to know that my current relationship would end up like this. But I literally just witnessed something with my own eyes and I need to figure out what I’m gonna do, if I’m gonna let this kick my ass like the 8 years of narcissistic abuse from my kids father or do i get really low about it and do nothing. Because let me tell you right now i have no plan. I have no permit; no license; no car; I’m on disability, my family doesn’t talk to me except for my dad and i just moved it of his house a couple months ago. I was planning on signing up for school in January and now I have to stop and go back to the drawing board and basically suck it up because I don’t think going through this a s come time would be good for me and most importantly for my kids who have been suffering from my past. Last but not least, I love him, I really do and now it looks like I’m gonna have to lose him because he already seems to want me out of his life. I’ve seen the texts and I have to get my life back."
NarcissisticAbuse,f6cz1qh,t1_f6cyrmi,1572789881.0,"Funny thing, my family and I don’t speak. My mother beat me up like two weeks ago and I changed the kids school a better school that will help my children. It almost feels like everything was too good to be true."
NarcissisticAbuse,f6cxhqy,t1_f6csjvu,1572789481.0,"I am
Trying to have a plan but I don’t because I haven’t done anything productive like o should have and I don’t have anything no permit, no job, no car. Nothing and I was trying to do that. That was my goal and I’m in the same spot I was years ago."
NarcissisticAbuse,f51q020,t1_f50wi55,1571943226.0,Okay I’ll try that
NarcissisticAbuse,f503blf,t1_f4zrgv8,1571921118.0,I unfortunately cannot rid him out of my life because of our two children. Coparenting doesn’t happen.
NarcissisticAbuse,f4zz4ba,t1_f4zk3ds,1571918871.0,"Omg that’s exactly what my boyfriend does now to describe me. He mimics like a child does. I hate it. But he’s not the narc, my kids father is."
NarcissisticAbuse,f4zys95,t1_f4yydk8,1571918686.0,"I have a boyfriend. It’s been a year since he’s been with his new supply. He has already done the triangulation and has flying monkeys. We don’t talk ever, we always argue or don’t say a word to each other. He however likes to be petty and do things that he knows are gonna upset me. He also allows his supply to disrespect me in a daily basis. We don’t interact. He picks up the kids and then leaves that’s it."
NarcissisticAbuse,f4zyjya,t1_f4yxh26,1571918548.0,Oh he changed but not for me. He changed for his supply!
NarcissisticAbuse,f4zyi4b,t1_f4yxgar,1571918519.0,That would be nice. I hate texting him.
NarcissisticAbuse,f4zyc0e,t1_f4ywm4d,1571918427.0,Guess it was pointless of me to try to be civil. Grey rock it is!
NarcissisticAbuse,f4ywjws,t1_f4ytqbz,1571887136.0,"What’s parallel parenting? 
We only text, no emailing because he has me blocked on Facebook. Also I don’t know if he would even want to email. He doesn’t even want to be around me in family therapy. Refuses to go if I’m there.  He has a supply so there’s no hoovering at all or ever even before he met her."
NarcissisticAbuse,f4ywcd3,t1_f4ysrtz,1571886972.0,That’s how we are now. I guess I’m being too kind and should cut it back.
NarcissisticAbuse,f4yw2kp,t1_f4yshr9,1571886768.0,"That does make sense. It’s like they say to themselves “wait a minute if she’s being nice then that means I have to be, better ignore her kindness.”"
NarcissisticAbuse,f4yvve9,t1_f4ysesy,1571886621.0,"Oh no no no I don’t want his attention. I don’t want anything to do with him. I just want to be civil and for my kids to have parents who can sort of coparent. Plus, he is too in love with his supply, so he’s always gonna be mean to me. The dude isn’t phased by anything"
NarcissisticAbuse,f4yvjld,t1_f4ysc24,1571886383.0,That sucks but he’s always mean I don’t think he wants anything but to make me feel like I’m the crazy one.
NarcissisticAbuse,f4yvh3a,t1_f4ys1jc,1571886338.0,"He’s the Nex, he has a new supply, we’ve been battling in court, a lot has happened. It’s been a pissing match between the two of us except that he continues to be petty and he’s always doing something to cause issues. Triangulation, flying monkeys, gaslighting, everything. Coparenting is non existent. I decided that maybe if I just acted different and not resentful or mad about everything he’s done. I want to get control over my life again. I don’t want conflict and so I decided to be “nice”. So I wrote the post asking because I don’t wanna get caught up In his raps by being nice and civil."
NarcissisticAbuse,f4yp6v1,t1_f4yon79,1571881835.0,"So I will never expect him to be kind back? For a while I was thinking that it could be for three reasons. His supply doesn’t like that I’m starting to be nice to the Nex and she does y want him to talk to me, two, he obviously doesn’t care that I’m being nice and still wants to be mean so he doesn’t like that I’m being nice cause it means he has to be civil with me or three he really just doesn’t care at all. In a way it seems that his supply doesn’t like it and he has to keep up that “my ex is fucking nuts and I want her to die” act to keep her happy or that he actually truly doesn’t care that I’m being nice for myself because I need to heal."
NarcissisticAbuse,f4ymqqy,t1_f4ym74s,1571880136.0,"This is true and I say it because i sent him a text saying thanks and telling him how much appreciate it what he did and the dude didn’t reply at all and when he did it was to tell me one word “here”. I almost felt like “wtf like I was just genuinely nice and gave you the thanks and he couldn’t even say you’re welcome?” I didn’t bother saying anything else. Instead what I got was my children telling me that he had sent a message to my daughter to tell me to watch “what the health” and that him and his supply are becoming vegans.  That they are working out at the gym now, he knows how much i love going to the gym. Anyways I care why? I do not care about them: I’m trying my best to stay away from the supply’s social media she loves to flaunt their relationship it’s been a while year, I wish it would die already."
legaladvice,f0rzu75,t1_f0rzdzp,1568896216.0,"Nope, she’s not doing anything illegal that I know of. No photos of me, just my children. I love how I’m getting downvoted because I asked what seems to be a stupid question. I know nothing about the law, I’ve never even been in trouble with the law. It was a legitimate question. Some of you redditors love to act all high and mighty but also thanks to those who took a second of their day to answer."
legaladvice,f0ryppn,t1_f0ryau8,1568895603.0,"Well to be frank, I really don’t feel comfortable with another woman posting pictures of me when this woman has harassed me several, several times. I should mention that I know nothing about her she is around my children every weekend and for all I know she could be a pedophile and her mother is also posting pictures of my children.  it just seems weird because I don’t know these people."
DunderMifflin,etyftzy,t3_cdvox7,1563317435.0,I always notice this too and laugh when she says “this is a button.”
