CPTSD,fr1ua66,t3_gm4x36,1589826059.0,"This was really nice to read, thank you for sharing. I've been trying to come to terms with this lately. That there was never anything ""bad"" or wrong with me. I still struggle with a lot of insecurities because of how much my family drilled them into me. But your post gives me more hope that I can get out of this.

It's strange, I remember being very young and being complimented by people. Then suddenly, I started to believe I was ugly and not good enough. All I could see were flaws. Clearly, someone worked hard to dull my shine, to the point I forgot who I was. I'm trying to get back to my real self before all the abuse.

Edit: nice Gotham reference, batman's my absolute favourite hero."

raisedbynarcissists,fqznfgl,t3_gleii2,1589771070.0,"Oh, absolutely. This is a huge part of it. I didn't fully understand until I was an adult that my Nmom was jealous of me and that may have been her ""motive"". It's horrible, even after reducing me to such a low state she continued to keep me down. Deep down, I still feel I'm unattractive, unsuccessful, and damaged although I've been NC for years.

You're right about some wanting their child to succeed, but not to outshine them too. What they want is their child to make THEM look good. It has nothing to do with the child's life or happiness. That's why they're so quick to pull a smear campaign over you the second you go NC or establish a boundary."

As in, settle for less than what I want to give someone a chance, just because they showed me interest. She made me feel like I was obliged to give myself to someone because if they were nice and I rejected them, I was being ""rude"". She made me think me being happy couldn't happen, so I honest to God had to settle and put up with bad stuff. As you could guess, this got me in bad situations. Thankfully I don't feel this way anymore and have boundaries. On the other side, she would accuse everything I did as being ""sexual"". And it made me paranoid to be around men."

CPTSD,fqy947z,t3_glhyg9,1589744734.0,"Hi I was abused for my childhood, moved constantly, bullied at schools, put through the foster system. By the time I was a teenager it was way out of control, my mental illnesses began to rear its head. Trauma, and an undetermined mood disorder. I tried to destroy my life so many times because I couldn't deal with it all anymore. I had one friend I kept in contact with that I met when I was 13, who ended up being the one person who never stopped giving up on me. He saved my life countless times and I did the same for him. His family became my family. He introduced me to really great friends and now I have real, supportive people in my life. Today, I don't struggle with most of the things I used to, because I've done so much healing. When I feel bad, I look back at where I've been and it becomes obvious just how far I've come. I can trust people and myself now. Healings always possible, no matter where you've come from or what you've done. I believe in you."

In hindsight of all of this, I'm kind of glad it failed because had it not, I wouldn't have realized I was subconsciously basing my self worth off of what they thought.

That's totally right. I was raised believing it was my job to ""solve"" why other people were mistreating me, and make excuses for them. But as you said, ""judging the behaviour not the person"" really simplifies it. That's all we ever needed to do. It was never my job to make excuses or try to justify why other people did the hurtful things they did.

Glad to hear you're away from the people who tried to tell you otherwise. Good luck at university!"
CPTSD,fqrhpkh,t3_gkiwdb,1589584577.0,"Yes. It depended on how far in recovery I was though. I made the mistake of telling the wrong people, because at that point I didn't understand boundaries or how to tell if someone was ""safe"" or not. (I still had a lot of toxic relationships but didn't realize) It was another learning experience. But the friends I have now are great people, and I've never felt more supported in my life."

CPTSD,fqefent,t1_fqczb3k,1589306648.0,"You're welcome. I'm glad it helps, it helps me a lot too knowing I'm not alone. :)

Yes I get that, the sense of unworthiness is intense. Cutting contact was the right move, because now I think I can start getting better. I would've never noticed I felt unworthy of love if this situation didn't occur. It's why when they showed me they thought I was unworthy, it hurt so bad. Because I believed it in my core. Even though I'm still very hurt, I dont feel that deep dread and anxiety of ""my life depends on them validating my worth"" now that they're gone.

It's not that I lost that person, they lost me. It's not that I wasn't ""good enough"" for them, they aren't good enough for me. It's not narcissistic to think that when it comes to people hurting you. It's how I remind myself what I think and feel matters, because asserting boundaries terrifies me. We deserve so much better, we can start working on it now.

The person really messed up the relationship, my friends helped me see I wasn't crazy or unreasonable. And if you don't have anyone to tell you, I will be the person to say: He (and the rest of the toxic people from your past) totally messed up. You cutting him off was justified and you're not crazy at all."
CPTSD,fqb6miz,t1_fqaurxb,1589231497.0,"I didn't realize this until I cut ties. The relationship was already doomed because of other reasons I didn't mention, but I think in my case it was so hard for me to let go because I subconsciously put **all** my self worth into what they thought of me. The biggest lesson I've taken from this is to not do that again."
CPTSD,fqb34ww,t1_fqb1pj3,1589229754.0,"I agree that it's a form of self harm to abuse others, it's very destructive to all parties involved. But I still don't see why someone can't be both an oppressor and traumatized at the same time, or why those have to be separate issues.. If it's not unresolved trauma from oppression that causes people to feel justified oppressing others, what do you think is the actual reason behind it? I'm not saying it's a logical train of thought, to think it's an excuse to hurt others. That's never okay. But that's how I felt and thought as a kid. I'm sure people will get to the bottom of it and find the true reasons one day.

Edit:
Just mentioning you don't have to respond if you don't want to, it's a tough subject. I understand if it's bothersome."
