largeformat,flifbay,t1_flibski,1585181305.0,"For 8x10, *everything* is 4 times the cost of 4x5. Lens, camera, film, developer, paper... 

If you are on a budget, shoot fomapan 100, or shanghai 100 on 4x5. If you dev that yourself, it's about the same price per frame as sending a 120 roll off to the lab and scan it at home. 

Let me see if I can think of tips to cut costs...

If you have a darkroom, you can simply get trays to develop. Cheap and easy.

If you decide to shoot 4x5, get an insert for a paterson tank. Or if you have a one reel 120 paterson tank, you can use the taco method. Fill that tank up high enough!

Washing the anti-halation layer off first, saves the developer.

A reusable developer like XTOL is cheap and not too poisonous. 

Wash one time with water after dev, and your stop bath will last forever.

Stop bath is a way to be able to reuse fixer a lot. Note that when a film comes out under fixed, looking milky, you can refix to solve this. Either fix longer or mix new. Never drain fixer, it is bad for aquatic life. If you do not have a chemical waste plant close, nature prefers if you'd pour it into a lawn over a drain.

New camera: Intrepid is okay. Chroma.camera also. There are others. Expect 350 USD.

But second hand is cheaper. In the US, Graphex are cheap, but if you do not get a camera that offers tilt, swing, rise, fall, (""movements"") you are missing out on the fun. 

Lenses... They come in shutters. This is where all the technical bits are. Get one with a shutter that works well. Check the aperture too. 

4x5: 150mm is considered normal, 135mm is slightly wider and easier to work with and to get right. I'd go for that. 180mm is like a 70mm on a 'full frame' camera. Most 4x5"" cameras can not extend the bellows far enough to close focus longer lenses. A 135mm lens uses a 135mm distance from the film to the lens when focused at infinity. When you focus for a portrait, it's easily an inch more. If you focus it as a macro, the bellows may need to extend 10 inches or so. Note you need to compensate your exposure time too, if you do that. Half a stop for a portrait, 2stops for a macro with double the bellows extension.

For 8x10, double all those numbers. 450mm is long. And expensive. Actually, all lenses that can project an image large enough to over a 8x10 sheet, are expensive.

Brands... not important. Rodenstock, Schneider, Nikon, Fuji, they are all good. Older ones like Kodak, Wollensack, can also be nice, but may be uncoated tessar type lenses. They have a certain charater to them. 

Expect 200 USD for a nice ""new"" (1970 or younger) 135mm lens in a proper shutter. 

Lensboard. 10 USD via Jinfinance on ebay. Check if your camera needs an offset hole. If the rise/fall is in neutral, the lens should be level with the center of the film. If the stand is higher, you need a lensboard with an offset hole.

If you want to walk about with your camera, get a lighter camera. Monorails are cheap but HEAVY. 

Of all tripods I have, the wooden Berlebach is my best. A tripod needs to be sturdy. There are things you do with your camera between composing, focusing.... and tripping the shutter. Like inserting a filmholder. If your stand moves, you ruin shots.

Mylightmeter app on your phone, free version. Excellent.

Filmholders... be on the lookout for cheap ones. Go for the all-plastic ones that do not look too beaten up. Note that 9x12 cm is smaller than 4x5 inch, on the inside. Not on the outside.

eehhhh.... ask away if you have questions."

If you want to make contact prints, consider going to 8x10 straight away and skip 4x5. Find a lens first, the camera is easier to find and not important. 

Size is more important than resolution when contact printing. If you want to squeeze out as much resolution as possible, consider pulling your film, meaning expose one or two stops more than what you meter, then develop for a shorter time to compensate.

It's all very complex and wild. But for now, the rest of the world follow the Chinese curve very closely."

Outside China, the growth factor has been about 1.25. My country does not do enough to counter it, which can be seen it the growth factor being above 1.4 every day so far.

France is at 1.6 based on what /u/[Mamadeus123456](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mamadeus123456/) wrote, and if they do not curb their enthousiasm, they will be at 10.000 next weekend.

I am more interested in the growth factor than in the absolute number. Italy today has 1.23 times the cases it had yesterday.  In the Netherlands, this number is 1.4 so we will see a faster growth. The officials seem to think we are not in trouble. If they do not get this growth factor down, we are only 6 days behind Italy. In year from now, these six days will be irrelevant. But today we could use it to prepare."

For instance a family of five all fell ill, save the youngest, after a holiday in Austria. They were denied testing and ordered to send the youngest to school. There are more cases like these discussed in parliament.

Dutch GPs want to be able to test more people, but are not allowed to. They asked the GP-society to speak up, but their response, in the national news was: 

NOS, 7th of march, late news, NPO1

*Jako Burgers: ""No, I am not for that, because the reason why we are now tackling this here in the Netherlands, and around the world, is that we do not want to overload the healthcare system. We want to prevent that many people get sick at the same time, many people need to be admitted to a hospital at the same time and the system cannot cope with that. So everything is aimed at limiting the care system, eh, the burden on our care system.""*

*Interviewer: ""What do you say to colleagues who want those guidelines to be broadened?""*

*Jako Burgers: ""Then we say that we understand that they are worried.  But there is a good reason to maintain this very strictly, otherwise we will not get it done.""*

Am I wrong to think that testing is a helpful step in the prevention of the spreading? Knowing who to tell to self-isolate needs to be based on such tests, right? Hence testing contributes to NOT overwhelm the healtcare system, doesn't it? How does not testing help?"

And, crucially, having had COVID-19 may not make you immune to SARS-CoV-2. On the contrary, it may even that you are in deeper trouble if you get reinfected. So isolation is the ONLY method to get rid of this."

The problem is: No one listens to an angry person, so getting angry does not help. But the data also does not help.

**The Milan Stock Exchange just opens tomorrow**
Despite the quarantine in the north of Italy, the Milan stock exchange will be open tomorrow. CEO Raffaele Jersalmi has announced this. According to him, sufficient measures have been taken to prevent the virus from spreading and there is no reason to close the stock market.

Milan is located in the middle of Lombardy, the northern region that was quarantined last night by the Italian government. Nobody is allowed in or out of the area, but human movements are also very limited within the closed zone. The Milan stock market index has been hit hard in recent weeks and it is expected that the government's measures will push the economy and stock prices even deeper. However, combating the virus is now a higher priority for the government than stock prices.

**Two more deaths from coronavirus in the Netherlands**
Two more people died in the Netherlands who were infected with the corona virus. They are two men, an 86-year-old who was hospitalized in Uden, and an 82-year-old who was hospitalized in Sittard-Geleen. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has announced this.
A total of three people in the Netherlands have died of the virus. An 86-year-old man admitted to a hospital in Rotterdam died on Friday. The RIVM reported today 77 new cases of the corona virus. The total with our northern neighbors comes to 265.

**How realistic are the figures?**
According to the official figures of Health, 31 new corona infections were added to our country yesterday. That does not seem like much, but perhaps the number of effective infections is a lot higher. During the weekend, people usually go to the doctor less quickly, not all corona cases are detected and, moreover, the number of tests is limited by a shortage of the necessary products. We will know the results of people going to the doctor tomorrow, Tuesday. Tuesday's figure update will therefore give a slightly clearer picture.

We do not (yet) have a death in Belgium, but a number of patients are cared for in the hospital for a serious pneumonia. ""And that's never good,"" says Van Ranst in ""Het Journaal"".
