legaladvice,fiyud5e,t1_fiysdu6,1582847154.0,Thanks. I filed a police report. I'm scared of cops but I was brave and thankfully the cop was pretty helpful. I got a report number. I told them not to tell my landlord because I am fearful of retaliation. I am going to move shortly after super Tuesday when I vote because this landlord has been a thorn in my side for years.

bipolar,ewsg3ms,t1_ewqxmhx,1565726873.0,Some people end up developing it (like triggers first episode) in response to stressful life events. Experiencing a lot of these took a toll on me. Could have probably developed it with genetics alone though.
