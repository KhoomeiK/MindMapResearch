My best friend reminds me of this all the time- I was a ""codependent"" with my mother. I thought when I left her house that meant I was somehow ""healed"" from that; I wasn't letting her be dependent on me, so we were no longer in a codependent relationship. But then I learned that word has a very different meaning... (Sorry if you're already more educated than I am on this.) As a codependent person, I could ALWAYS come up with an excuse for what she did to me, I could always defend it, sometimes even better than she could.
