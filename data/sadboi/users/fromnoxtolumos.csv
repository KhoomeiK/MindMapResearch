Once I reach a desired color that‚Äôs exactly what I do and when I‚Äôm taking a break from it the tan typically lasts me about 6 months before my european genes start showing again haha.

legaladvice,fnzs3bv,t1_fnzdxpv,1587399771.0,"That was the intention, and I did sign some legal papers from his lawyer he had emailed to me to give up my rights, however I never heard anything after that. He just said he was going to get a new lawyer. Wouldn‚Äôt there be a court hearing or wouldn‚Äôt I have been notified about something like that? I am suspecting that he hasn‚Äôt even gotten a new lawyer. I am afraid because he is a very vindictive person and uses things ove people‚Äôs head. I don‚Äôt want to worry for the ext 10 years if I am going to get in trouble for abandonment. According to my state law I looked up, it says that with intent to forgo responsibility is also considered abandonment. The only reason I think he hasn‚Äôt pursued any such thing is fear that the kids would be taken back into state custody. Maybe I should ask him if the adoption was finalized? If so I would like a copy for my records. Or should I try to contact the lawyer he was going through?"
legaladvice,fnxvgg5,t1_fnxrbb4,1587347196.0,"I have a few questions thrown in there. To sum it up I am asking, 1. Could I be charged with abandonment and get sent to jail if someone decided to call and report me? Even though I have a notorized document as well as texts stating that they are in the care of the great grandma and adoption conversations. 2. Is there anything else I could do to protect myself against this somehow from coming to bite me back in the a**? (other than getting a lawyer) 3. Would the text conversations of adoption hold up in court if it came to that, proving I did not abandon them? That they were suppose to be adopted. The grandfather has obviously not made any attempts to adopt the children and I fear its going to come back and somehow bite me in the arse."

Their father is doing whatever it is he does..I could not say because I don‚Äôt talk to him so I do not know. In the custody order I received from the court last year it states that the kids are not allowed to live with their father for 3 years following the case. Their grandfather spoke to their dad and got him to agree to the adoption yes. Last I had spoken with the grandfather he was looking into finding a new lawyer for some reason. But every time I kept trying to get updates and new info he just kept giving me some new excuse so I‚Äôm not sure what is going on with that. He said he was going to adopt them then he said that the lawyer suggested permanent custody and then round and round it went and now nothing.. I‚Äôm tired of sitting around on this. I just need my ex‚Äôs family out of my life completely. They are living with their gg because I was about to be evicted and had nowhere to go at the time, no financial stability (even if I had them now I still wouldn‚Äôt be able to care for them properly seeing how I am trying to get my life together and it‚Äôs hard enough.)
