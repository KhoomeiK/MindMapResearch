labrats,flbmiv1,t1_fl9om3p,1585007767.0,"I agree, it sucks, and I'm sorry. That being said, I think about what I would do if I grew up on a farm before all these supermarkets. I would become attached to these animals, and love them and care for them, but ultimately would kill them to survive.  For the record, I would feel very badly about it too, but that's what keeps us humble, loving, and human."

AmItheAsshole,fjf5me4,t3_fcxfgm,1583284812.0,"Your wife should not allow her daughter to disrespect you, or any other adult like that, ever. If that were me growing up, I would have been sent to my room hungry. You should really consider discussing the situation further with your wife. Best of luck!"

It may be somewhat biased-based, but I am appalled that someone would ever relate rape to consensual sex. I just hope you don't actually think they are remotely comparable. I also pray you do not have a daughter."

rapecounseling,es9kww7,t3_c6j7ms,1561738554.0,"It is so nice to see you care so much. I went through a similar thing myself, and it's hard to talk about because you don't want people to look at you differently,  it feels embarrassing.  Just make her feel loved, and let her know it is okay to feel sorry for herself because it is an awful thing to go through. I never had any support, and got through it, but recently started to finally realize how much it has effected me. I have been considering therapy, bow that 14 years later I'm finally ready to talk and start healing. Maybe suggest going with her to therapy if the tow if you are comfortable.  Best if luck to you both. I am so happy to see you supporting the woman you love."

It makes me feel less embarrassed, even though I know in my heart it is nothing to be embarrassed about. I cannot wait to embark on this journey, so I can get some of my pieces put back together."

adultsurvivors,eq6uc02,t1_eq6tyh5,1559835552.0,Thank you for taking the time to respond. It has been about the same time since (15 years) for me as well. Have you found therapy helps? I'm scared to open up to a stranger.
