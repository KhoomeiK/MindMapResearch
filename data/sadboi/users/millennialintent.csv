Oppressed and marginalised groups tend to rely very heavily on their communities or else they feel their lives at risk or their existence threatened. It makes sense when you think of it in terms of epigenetics. The gay community carries the memories of that trauma down the generations. 

Socialism offers the utopian community spirit which actually doesn’t exist on that scale. Gay people often feel that this offers them something of comfort. They can’t see the damage it will do.

I had a mental break down in my final year and had to move back home to live with my parents. 

I decided that I would continue with my degree in the final year from home and drove to university. 

I spent that final year in pieces. It's a miracle that I finished the degree at all, let alone come out of it with a decent enough grade. 

That last year I was suicidal throughout the winter, manic in between, in tears every day for at least the first half of the year, and felt dead inside for much of it. 

The disappointment and shame my parents might have expressed was the only motivating factor for my continuing and also because I had invested so much time into such a hollow and miserable experience that I could not leave without anything to show for myself.

In short, University was one of the worst experiences of my life and I do not think I could even face doing a Masters at this point. I love learning, but that environment is toxic and alienating. I had so much dissociation and I felt like I was a ghost or invisible most of the time. It was really a horrible experience for me."

Schizoid,fptqu7r,t1_fpm9dfy,1588896420.0,"Accepting the pace of our lives is not like everyone else’s and that we can do nothing and should try to do nothing to change it, is a fundamentally healthy thing to learn and something I’ve been grappling with in the past year or so. All the milestones that society expects from you are also just reference points for a different type of existence. 

I may not have as many relationships or even a partner. I may not get married. I may do later in life. Life is not linear and mapped out for us like many normal people might think or aspire for it to be.

It just is what it is, and the faster we cotton onto it, the faster we can move past that weight existential crisis and focus on the small things that bring us some semblance of joy."

I don't feel like that as much these days and I haven't done anything/ taking any medications to help with it. It makes me feel like I'm not really severe enough to need help.
