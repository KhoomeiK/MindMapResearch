starcitizen,fr4hn4j,t1_fr3j3vh,1589888473.0,">It's not like the Hornet is a hulking tank and the Sabre is a quick ship made of cardboard.

That's precisely what it is. As you said, they're both in the same 'class' of combat vehicle, so you look at their differences. You even pointed them out, but then don't understand what they mean. There's a reason the Sabre has three shields and the super hornet has one. Sabre is a shield tank. It's based on stealth and speed. It gets its 'superiority' by using surprise and fast hit & run tactics. It's an assassin. It's not designed to brawl with a warrior, which is what the hornet is designed to be. It's certainly then not designed to brawl with a hornet that has *two* men inside it, splitting the duties of the craft, while the Sabre has to accomplish everything himself.

You didn't even mention ammunition types. While both ships can be fitted for short or long distance encounters, Hornets were traditionally short-range fighters, flying on patrol, supported by the larger ships or stations they launched from. I'd expect a Sabre to be further away from its departure point, conducting a surprise attack on an unsuspecting enemy. The total amount of time you expect to be fighting influences which kinds of weapons you plan to use. Long battles without close access to resupply would be energy weapons. Short battles you can zip back for more ammo? Ballistics. Otherwise you run out of ammo. But the Sabre is a hit & run attacker, so it'll likely come in firing an alpha strike of high-damage weapons to try to down the enemy all at once, so you'd expect ballistics. If it doesn't get the kill, it simply flies away. So how does this affect each ship?

The Sabre is a hit & run shield tank. If you go up against it with a full energy load-out, you'll be at a serious disadvantage, as it's difficult to hit, all rounds will need to deplete three shields before you score any permanent damage, and if its shields start getting low, it'll just fuck off for a bit until they recharge, forcing you to start all over again. The only bonus is if you do get through the shields, it's not heavily armored. It can't be, or it will lose its speed and maneuverability.

By contrast, the hornet is heavily armored, with far less shields. Armor will supposedly take damage from energy weapons, but protects the hull against ballistic weapons. So what does this mean?

Going up against a Super Hornet, you'll have two minds working against you instead of one. The RIO is going to handle all radar contacts, countermeasures and maintain the turret's tracking on you at all times. The pilot just needs to pitch and yaw to ensure you're above him, taking shots and locking missiles any time you're ahead of them. Energy weapons will deplete their shields and do damage to armor, so they're probably the better choice, as ballistic rounds will partially penetrate the shields, but much of it is going to bounce off the armor.

By contrast, the Sabre's shields will be penetrated by ballistic weapons from the start. When the RIO hits, each round will do permanent damage to the hull, albeit less than you'd score from an unshielded target, but as mentioned earlier: trying to get through 3x shields on a Sabre is a waste of time. Without the heavy armor of the super hornet, those rounds will actually do some damage, which is why I said the Sabre *cannot* even so much as slow down, or the Super Hornet is going to shred them.

It's a big game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock. Speed, accuracy, length of engagement, weapon load outs, etc. Could the battle go either way? Of course. If the Sabre shows up and the SH isn't moving at all and gets blasted by a full, concentrated line of energy weapons and missiles on a single spot on shields and hull it'd likely do enough to rip through a super hornet. But it's stealth--not invisibility. This isn't a Romulan D'deridex uncloaking at point blank and unloading a full spread. The Super Hornet is going to pick up the radar contact as soon as the Sabre powers weapons, and unless they're AFK or stupid, they're going to start moving. By and large, after the Sabre has lost its element of surprise, as long as the SH isn't completely loaded with energy weapons, the Sabre will be at a disadvantage.  It's just like D&D: assassins focus on unarmored targets.

Note: I like *both* ships, but I understand their intended roles. My play style actually leans towards the Sabre, but I'm not naive enough to think I'm going to be able to backstab the level 20 paladin with +5 plate armor."

Since it's all pressurized gas and rock, rather than like a chemical reaction we think of when we generally think of explosions (bombs) and shockwaves, perhaps there simply isn't one. The noise is all simply the change in air pressure caused by simply *that much* energy being released, and matter being moved?

Hell, I think it's still the most powerful natural disaster the U.S. has ever experienced in recorded history, period.

They didn't have the technology to estimate the power of the blast, and the fact that the north face of the mountain sheered off into the world's largest recorded landslide redirected the blast flow. They were caught off-guard when Mother Nature essentially aimed a shotgun at them, instead of up into the sky like they'd expected.

Granted, the guy who hiked out 14 miles was killed by the falling ash. He probably wasn't 14 miles away from the volcano when it exploded. The pyroclastic flow flat out 'removed' everything in its path for 8 miles. Past that it snapped trees like twigs and killed anything that wasn't somehow blocked by terrain. The guy who ran 14 miles was either shielded by a hill, or further away, but still suffocated in all the ash that fell for miles around."

functionalprint,fpm559d,t1_fpki4pv,1588725769.0,"Oh, and I failed to mention this one bit because it's residential wiring, so you probably won't, but just in case:

If it's over 150 feet, you start running the risk of attenuation (signal loss) as stranded doesn't transmit as well as solid. Solid will go 300 feet, but stranded...well, theoretically does less. I've never actually tested it. I've never seen a stranded cable over 50ft."
functionalprint,fpm4kqk,t1_fpl4ssj,1588725432.0,"8p8c connectors (in all the ones I've ever seen) are just a trident. Stranded or solid, it's a harder metal (typically steel, plated in gold) biting into the copper. The stranded cable can't be pushed aside--it has nowhere to go. Hell, IIRC, typically stranded cable (8x32awg) is a little thicker than solid (24awg) because of the tiny gaps between the wires increasing width. Stranded, by nature, will have increased insertion loss, and thus greater attenuation, but your contact will all be pretty much the same. Even if one had more surface contact than another, you need so little to meet use requirements it doesn't change anything. Honestly, stranded is more annoying to crimp because it doesn't always stay where you put it as well as solid does, so it may wiggle out of the row, but once you figure out the process it's second-nature. You get used to ""solid is for punch down tools, stranded is for crimping.""

Now, in an 8p8c connector, would stranded cable be weaker if stressed? Absolutely. I said earlier that stranded is weaker in all respects. This is the cost of the flexibility. But let's be serious: if you're relying on the connector's contact with the copper to hold your cable together, you're already doomed. It's not designed to do that. Anyone who has screwed up during crimping and cut the jacket back too far (or, technically, didn't cut the copper back far enough) to not get the jacket beneath the compression fitting knows fully well just how much weaker that cable is. The wires wiggle back and forth inside the connector and you know the only thing keeping them there is the metal-on-metal contact. 8p8c plugs are held together by the compression fitting biting into the jacket (and deforming the UTP beneath) far more than the contact points.

Largely, we just run solid in walls because it has less attenuation (up to 50%) and is easier to run because it's stronger and easier to handle. Patch cables being stranded is purely for ease of use, as they don't ""fight back"" like solid does. If you're happy with solid, go with it. It's better at transmitting and it's less expensive.

(Stranded is more expensive because it's been processed more. The number in the American Wire Gauge standard [AWG] indicates the number of times the wire has been 'pulled'. Wire is made thinner by stretching it. The more times it's been stretched, the thinner it becomes. This is why lower numbered gauges are actually thicker wires. So by this logic there's obviously a lot more processing going into making stranded cable: a solid cable is eight wires that were pulled 24 times.  A stranded cable is 64 wires that were pull 32 times. It's still only pennies of difference, though.)"

In-wall cables are solid copper, coated appropriately, and are punched down into jacks. The little jacks clip into the wall mount. This means everything in the wall is safe and outside of an 'active' area where people would live or work. Everything on the other side of that jack is normally a stranded-wire ""patch"" cable, like the one you're using there. It flexes better, but it's weaker. That's the trade-off.

What's gonna upset you is if someone trips over that cable, or an animal chews on it or something. In the former case, it'll either snap the cable (unlikely) or cause damage to the wall at the first bend, since the gypsum isn't designed to handle that stress. In the latter, you'll be forced to either crimp both ends again and use a coupler (*\*shudder\**) or punch it down into a wall jack anyway. I've honestly never tried that with stranded, so I'm not even sure how that would work. Prolly be annoying as hell to do, cuz the cables wouldn't stay where you put them.

Unskilled labor doesn't get paid that much, especially in a world where I can literally buy labor in the form of alt accounts that are my crew. NPCs. I don't know why you expect there will be 'balance' incorporated into the game in the economy: the economy sorts that out. There will be high risk and low risk, but if something as simple as cargo requires either you manually unload it yourself, or pay more than you're going to make off the actual shipment, no one is going to do it--plain and simple. That's not balance; that's the absence of a mechanic CIG spent time coding into the game.

Where are you getting these absurd figures for how much you expect unskilled labor to charge to move boxes?  You're pulling them out of your ass and that doesn't make it fact. CR bases a lot of the game off how things work in the real world, and I gotta tell you: Walmart employees unloading the trucks don't get 30% of the total value of the merch they haul off.

IDK if you've some fantasy where you believe you're gonna make yourself rich in game moving boxes, but I got bad news for ya.

Hell, this far in the future, you can expect robots to be doing most of the heavy lifting. Amazon already uses them. 30%? Try 0.0003%"

That's the best part: he kicked the door in frustration--he wasn't even trying to break in. Ironically I've a cop car sitting out front, and we used to joke you'd have to be crazy to try to break into our house. Spoilers: He was.

For that reason I didn't press charges under the condition he get the help he needed. Uncannily, the incident forced me to remove part of the door, which revealed previously hidden water damage within the wall, getting in through the window above.

As for the other comment: Again:  ""*Certainly not paying 15% of profits to have something loaded or unloaded""*

I get everything you said, but my point was if you're hauling something so worthless that literally just unloading it eats up 15% of your profits, you've already wasted your time and/or the cost of labor is entirely too high. You said 10 credits a minute, at 10 boxes a minute. That's a credit a box, to make things simpler. If I'm hauling 500 units of cargo, that's 500 credits.  To equal 15% of the profit you are making, that means you only made 3,333 credits of profit.  3,333 credits of profit off of 500 boxes? That doesn't make sense, and doesn't scale.

My point was that I'd be fine paying 500 credits to unload my ship. The difference is that what I'm hauling will net me a profit of 65,000 credits. The way you said it, that'd cost me 10,000 credits to unload, when it's still just 500 boxes. The value of the item itself doesn't influence how much you'd pay someone to unload a box. The prices at which you bought and are going to sell it for influence it even less--they don't even know how much you bought it for. But if I'm paying a credit a box to unload, as per your scenario, that'd be 0.7% of my profits to unload. Note: Not 7%, zero-point-seven percent. A percent of a percent. Less than 1%. *That* is an acceptable cost, and what I expected when I originally wrote all of this."
