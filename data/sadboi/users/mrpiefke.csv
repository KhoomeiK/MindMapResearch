bullying,f27yzxn,t1_f27swzc,1570049086.0,Oh my God.. :-(  A drug addict as Principal.. And i thought i had it hard here in Germany in School after the Post-Reunification-Chaos of the 90s.. I can't even imagine how to be able to go like that.. Please stay strong.. I just can't understand how it is possible that you have to live like that at such (presumably) young age in a developed and rich country.. Sorry it's just words.. You can't eat them.. And they won't give you any shelter.. But people are thinking about you and care.. Even it is not enough.. I just hope that you can make it through these hard times and come out stronger but still emotionally stable.. I wish you a good and satisfying life.. You deserve it after all that.. :-)
HumansBeingBros,f27utm5,t3_dccqec,1570046549.0,Wow.. How awesome.. :-D I wish you all the best..
bullying,f27rrvq,t1_f27e2sh,1570044727.0,"Oh my god.. I'm nearly speechless.. How can it be that a young boy ( i think because you're in school) be that alone... Fighting so hard every Day and Night.. There must be a support System for children where you live? I can't imagine the burden you have to carry being a student..  Sorry that i have no real solution here but i live in Germany and there are Government Agencies that care for People under 18 when their Parents can't or as in your case even die.. I'm on one side incredibly sorry for your loss and the Hardships you have to experience. And on the other Side proud of you for being so strong. Please fight back (not physically of course).. Please ask the Principal for help.. What the Teacher does here is very unprofessional.. The teacher should not be able to work with children at all.. Sorry for my bad English I'm from Germany... But i just had to say something.. I just wanted to say something to make you feel better and not so alone.. PLEASE seek help.. There must be support for you!!!
I wish you all the best!!!!!"
Battletechgame,f21swq5,t1_f20d5uc,1569876365.0,Beautifully said and absolutely on Point..
HorrorGaming,f1fmj4k,t1_f1eb15j,1569447777.0,Hmm.. I didn't notice that.. Always felt like the games push me in a certain direction.. Yes try it.. It's a creepy Mindfuck.. I like the Dystopian-Cyberpunk Setting.. You explore the Minds of some troubled People in Observer.. Aside frome the two (?) sneaky scenes it is story driven..
Eyebleach,f1dv5qs,t3_d8t0q5,1569401093.0,Sweet Girl... Love that snoot..
HorrorGaming,f1dqi71,t3_d8q88i,1569394659.0,"Yes i liked it.. But only for one Playthrough.. You know most creepy moments/jumpscares by then.. I'm playing >OBSERVER again for a second Time since yesterday.. It's a Cyber-Horror-Mindfuck.. Also by Bloober Team.. Worth it i think if you like Layers of fear.. Just a dystopian setting.. But please make sure you don't have epilepsy.. There is so much going on at times it could trigger.. And there are at least two scenes where you have to sneak.. It can be frustrating but they aren't that long.. On my first playthrough it was annoying.. On the second it was just a side note i could concentrate on the story as it is slowly revealed.. Greetings from Germany.. :-)

Edit: Guess it's the same with both Games.. If you don't play them for a while you forget some scares.."

The Battletech Universe was invented in a Time where we couldn't foresee how fast technology would develop.. I mean the Computer Brain Interface Elon Musk's Company is working on and stuff like that.. The future is in every possible regard a combination of man and machine.. Implants (Medical Implants or even Limbs) are becoming reality.. And if Battletech was new now it would look way different.. We are one with the Machine.. The flesh (alone) is too weak.. In the future (if we manage not to destroy ourselves) Humanity has to leave this Planet.. We can't possibly do it on a realistic long term in our current weak form.. Sorry for my weak English..

But violence can be verbally too.. Its even more common that way.. Just because i tend to avoid conflict dosen't change the way humans are born..
