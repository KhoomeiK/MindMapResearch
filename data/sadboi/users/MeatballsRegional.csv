Crown isn't bad all the time, my chief complaint is there often isn't good veggies. By the end of my freshman year I was ready to go to Walmart and eat a raw green pepper. Their green beans often look good but aren't.

But lemme tell you what is good at crown. Go to the gluten free area. You have to stand in line and actually order which tends to intimate some people. It's great. I usually ask for everything but tomatoes and tofu, Thai sweet chill, salt pepper garlic. You just get your own asiany rice thing. Kind of.

Panda Express is always so good! I saw a big ass roach there once, but it was only one time and I have no standards for what I put into my body.

Chick-fil-A is A++

Burger 704 is pretty good in my opinion. 

Sovi is a lot like crown but they usually have a bit more options. If you're living in South village they're great. If you're in North Village or others then Crown is the most convenient, and it's open later than SoVi.

No complaints about SoVi2go, it's quick, it's easy. It's exactly what you'd anticipate it is.

Bojangels always manages to get my order wrong and I somehow end up having to pay them to fix it. Wendy's often (but not always) messes up my order, but they fix it without complaint.

The place on the third floor of prospector. Mondo's Sub's. Love 'em, absolutely great.
