Fashion and makeup subs are full of interesting and unique looks and stuff, but there‚Äôs definitely no overall community orientation towards anything my mom would call ‚Äúa becoming look‚Äù lol.

So there‚Äôs a lot of potential for this community to be a great integrated resource for all these different aspects of appearance improvement.

I feel like BFR is better as a resort for people who have both full and saggy buccal fat pads and no cheekbones or jaw (nothing available to help balance or lift).

Vindicta,fqtrui3,t3_gkrfki,1589644878.0,Buy men‚Äôs beard dye. It‚Äôs like 8 dollars and you can reseal the dye kit and reuse it dozens of times. Tips: probably get a lighter shade than you think you need at first (also watch out for too ashy or too warm tones). Also don‚Äôt leave it on longer than 5 minutes/ whatever the box says or your skin will get dyed. Qtip around the edges once it‚Äôs on to help with that too.
Vindicta,fqtrfn4,t1_fqtaqhr,1589644649.0,I think she definitely got Botox to the forehead so there‚Äôs that lift in the upper eye and brow area. And looks like she could have gotten undereye filler but you can get that effect  from just the cheek filler too.
Vindicta,fqtr6cd,t1_fqtm1cg,1589644503.0,As similar as it looks I don‚Äôt think this could be the same day because her Botox in the brows looks to have taken effect (lifted brow area). Which would be at least several days if not a week or two. The jaw Botox doesn‚Äôt show slimming for a month at least so it‚Äôs either much later or the slimming effect visible here is from the cheek filler.
Vindicta,fqtqtgm,t1_fqt3wbh,1589644302.0,Looks like she might have also gotten under eye filler (but that effect could be from the cheek filler giving some lift there) and she definitely had Botox in the forehead cause here brow line looks a bit lifted.

I‚Äôve had a fat face for lyfe and it is TRUE that your face will slim out as you get older (by 24 you will probably start appreciating the cheeks. By 28 you will feel blessed). 

Some other less extreme/permanent options would be cheekbone filler to add upper face width/volume/balance, jaw Botox if a bulky masseter muscle is adding excessive volume to the cheeks, or jaw filler to help lift and define the jawline."

Summation of the scientific studies done so far is: IF in and of itself does not induce weight loss any more than not doing IF. However, limiting your eating window through the practice of IF is the thing that effectively ends up limiting your calories (and is probably an extremely effective mental and habitual guideline that will stick for more people than just trying to focus on calories). So, yes you need a calorie deficit. Just IF will not get you losing weight. But doing IF will probably end up being an effective calorie limiting tool unless you overeat during your eating window."

yoga,fqs6ivl,t1_fqs4kn9,1589599634.0,"Also not OP, but lowering the heels all the way to the floor is absolutely not necessary or recommended as a goal. The majority of people are not going to reach their heels to the floor. Like with every asana, the point is to look at the fullest expression of the pose to emulate it to the best of your ability, with a priority of keeping the correct, pain free alignment in your body. No need to worry about reaching the maximum expression of an asana, especially when it‚Äôs something based in flexibility (as opposed to strength or balance).

That said in downward dog your knees should have a slight bend, so they are not locked straight. Focus on the energetic sense of length in the back of your legs and extending your heels down towards the floor by shifting your hips up and back and keeping your torso and spine long. Shoulders, hips, and spine are most important, heels reaching down is the idea; how far doesn‚Äôt matter."

I truly could not care less about the comments where someone posts some moral invective about whatever the fuck she‚Äôs doing or has done. She is a narcissist and therefore shitty at the core. This is established fact and it‚Äôs not interesting to see someone point out a new iteration of it. We can all easily see her shittiness for ourselves, not to mention that it‚Äôs utterly irrelevant when people try to explain their moral judgment to her. (Stop treating her like a psychologically normal person who might actually internalize it!)

I don‚Äôt follow her even on my finsta because it is straight up assaultive how often she posts, so I am personally at risk for missing the good comments. The black hole of her ego is draining, even virtually, so limited periods of exposure are recommended. I highly suggest my carp consumption method of occasionally checking her feed when the mood strikes.
