SchofieldCabanaAbuse,fpu8o87,t1_fj123ur,1588907095.0,"I remember when Susan and Michael were giving an interview and said something along the lines of, ""J refuses play with real children and rather with her ""hallucinations"""". It reminded me of when my mom told me that back when I was obsessed with the movie, A Bug's Life, back when I was in preschool, I would play with the characters of the movie as imaginary friends instead of real flesh and blood children. (For context, I am a high masking, low needs, and fully verbal autistic person, although while this happened, my masking was of course not the best and I was still in speech therapy but I began speaking about a year after beginning the program). It got to the point to where they had to keep that movie away from me because I would rather play with Flick, Princess Atta, Dot, Heimlich, Francis, Dim, ect. and not my siblings and other peers. I honestly don't remember me being that absorbed in that movie to the point of rejecting real life humans to play and/or interact with, but I am not denying her claim either. I do indeed remember absolutely loving that movie (I had the VHS with Dot on the cover because she was my favorite character. Heck, my 4th birthday party was A Bug's Life themed.) I can understand they did not want this to stunt my abilities to connect with other children (it's possible that this ""play with imaginary bugs because humans are boring"" phase didn't last longer than a few weeks or a month give or take). I honestly don't know the whole story and I might not want to know.

When Susan and Michael talk about when J played with her ""hallucinations"" and not real people, it's likely a symptom of autism that I also went through. It seems to have started when she was around the same age I began to do this (ages 3-5). With J, it continued into elementary school whereas with me, I either had to give in to being ""grounded"" from the source that feed this behavior or just grew out of that phase. Susan and Michael had obviously dramatized the situation to trick people into believing their phony ""my seven year old was born schizophrenia"" story."
Autistic_safe_space,fpo13z1,t1_fpni96k,1588776476.0,"For me it's been both okay per se and burnout inducing. I still live with my parents and they think I am taking this situation too seriously, when in really, they are being too chill about it. My mom's birthday was last week and she still went ahead and had a two different birthday parties where she had quite a few people attend to each one. This was done so the amount of guests would be lower for each one rather than cramming them all in the same party. The first one was with her relatives (which included children as young as 4 years old) and the second was with her friends. She actually made my sister and her boyfriend drive up from a major metropolitan city to go to this. She had people since Karaoke (which included me because she said me singing her a few songs was the birthday present she wanted from me) with microphones all sorts of people had been handling and who knows if anyone washed their hands. In fact, I don't think I saw anyone wearing masks at either party. My mom thinks she was entitled to have these parties because this was a milestone birthday (she turned 50) and that she is a hard worker who is still working at a difficult time such as this (which is true, but it's still dangerous to be having these gatherings).
I live in a state where the state is opening back up in phases. I don't know if other states are doing this, but from what people who live in other states have said, it's peculiar that this is how the governor is taking it. My mom thinks that having these parties was perfectly safe because she is a nurse. My dad just goes along with what she says. They have also been making me visit my 88 year old great grandmother at the nursing home she had been living in. I would have been more than happy to visit her if a full blown pandemic she is vulnerable to wasn't going on. She was recently removed from that facility and is now under the care of my great aunt and great uncle. This Sunday is Mother's Day and this month is also great grandmother's birthday month. I am getting the feeling, mom and dad are going to make me come with them to visit her. I really cannot say no to this. When I do say no, they say, ""No, you're coming with us to see her"". 
On this past Sunday, I did tell them I would feel better staying at home at this time and only go out when it is most necessary and/or mandatory. They actually said, you can do that, just don't take this ""situation"" out of hand. I have been laid off of work for a month now and I might not be able to go back to work until June. I try to stay home as much as I can. People assume that just because I was born the year after the movie Pulp Fiction was released (I turned 25 years old in February) that this means I am a reckless brat that goes out and still attends gatherings thus prolonging the pandemic. I am doing what I can to not be that. It has gotten to the point to where before I was laid off, I felt guilty even going to work because people are telling us to STAY AT HOME. The reality is that my parents are more like that stereotype than I am."

SchofieldCabanaAbuse,fnybz08,t1_fnq5oyc,1587358698.0,"Thank you for your input. I've actually have been doing much better about this situation since this post was written back in November. There are too many other things on my mind with the current events that I need to think about than this case. I hardly ever even check this sub anymore. Maybe it was because I had to have surgery a couple of months ago. I have never had a surgery in my life and I'm in my mid 20's so that was a big change to not only my regular routine but also what I normally over fixate on.

I am also trying to avoid getting involved in cases that involve minors that likely don't want to be documented (this also involves family vlogs). I'm tired of seeing vlogger families (well, parents) being glorified for raising ""difficult"" children to use as cash cows. There is one in particular which I will not be naming that is notably triggering to me because they are using invasive and sometimes inappropriate footage in their content and giving the ""but it's for educational purposes"" excuse. The same happened with the case this sub is dedicated to, however, this family gets away with it because their house is clean and they have a higher budget for filming and editing quality. Susan on the other hand relied on potato quality phone filming when Discovery Health wasn't there to film after the 2017 update known named ""Big Changes"". I'm about at the point to where I feel like I should refer to these kids by pseudonyms because I want to validate their identity (especially when the case involves mental illness, developmental and/or intellectual disabilities).

I am still seeing the same therapist I was seeing when this was made. We have worked through this together and I am doing a better job obsessive wise with this case. We have to have video chat appointments now which is expected with what's going on in the world now, but I try to bring up whatever concern comes to my mind when we do get an appointment together. I appreciate your will to let me in on how you feel about this. I am doing what I can to get better every day. Stay safe and stay home if you can.

The only times I have checked this sub-reddit were for checking on notifications on my post. I am working on my coping skills and trying to occupy my time on other things than reading up on this case. Would it be worth it to go out and find a new consular even if I just started seeing her a little over two months ago? Another thing to take into account is finding a therapist/company that will accept your health insurance. There are many places I would like to get help from, but the problem is that they might not take the insurance I have. I have used anxiety hotlines in the past and while they are handy, I would like to actually know the consular in person rather than talk without really knowing each other. What should I look for in a consular? How would I know if the consular is effective enough or not? I truly to want to get better and come off as more sane to everyone here.

I don't like to lie on this stuff, lying makes me feel hypocritical. I even asked other friends of mine and my sister if I am truly messed up because of this. I wasn't able to talk to my sister about the whole situation I am in since she didn't get to stay for too long. As for my friends who did get to hear and see everything, they still told me to not worry about what other people on the internet say and that my heart seems to be in the right place about wanting to be friends with Jani and Bodhi.

Maybe a better term I could have used would be being a mentor to them since I am seven and a half years older than Jani and almost 13 years older than Bodhi. I don't even have pictures of them on my laptop or any device for that matter. I haven't read either of Michael and Susan's books and I haven't seen the first Born Schizophrenic documentary since it aired in 2010. I have never donated to the Jani Foundation even before Susan began making videos again on a regular basis in mid 2017.

My next appointment with my therapist is not until the 13th this month so it will be a good while until I can get back to her on this. Would calling an anxiety hotline be an okay option to get to for more treatment per se on this? The main thing that is over fixating me on this at the time is what people think about me and if they think I'm a malevolent obsessive or a decent person.

Would you have worn that dress when you were that age (I don't know your gender, but I thought I would still ask)? I guess some of my fuss was from me being worried the group home staff might be infantilizing her. It's as if they are dressing her in clothes and accessories meant for children younger than her just because she is autistic/developmentally delayed/has ""special needs"".  It's this internalized idea society has that disabled people (most notably intellectually disabled or even just having a learning disability) are perpetual children, thus meaning we have to treat them like children. I know Jani is still technically a minor so I will let this slide. However, if she is still a resident there past the time she turns 18 or at least until Susan's chance of possibly obtaining her son and daughter back (February of 2021) and they are still treating her like a 7 year old rather than a young adult, I will be gravely disappointed. Of course this might not even be the case at all. I might be me making theories about this that allude to infintalization since I have been subjected to treatment such as this myself. Many times, people who know that I'm autistic will still talk to me as if I am 10+ years younger than my real age (I'm 24). They assume that just because I'm autistic, it means I can't drive, I have to have my ""mommy and daddy"" watch over and take care of me, that I don't know what sex is, don't know the meaning of swear words, don't have a job, can't cook meals, can't clean my room, the list goes on.

I was put on risperdal when I was 13 which made be gain a considerable amount of weight. I stopped taking that after about 6 months or so and my weight dropped drastically back to normal. Then I was put on seroquel and depakote when I was 19. The seroquel made me gain 20-25 pounds in a matter of a few months and depakote made my hair fall out. Once I told the first psychiatrist at this practice that my hair was thinning, he immediately took me off of the depakote and put me on gabapentin instead which I am still taking even to this day. 

The psychiatrists I had at the time were not only too laid back but also careless. They pretty much put me on that ""medicine"" just to get me to quit crying, being dramatic, and make me shut up. the seroquel also made me terribly drowsy. There was one point where I was set on such a dosage, that I nearly fell asleep on myself when I was driving to a psychiatrist appointment. When I got to the facility, I fell asleep waiting for my appointment which also caused me to sleep through the time when my appointment was supposed to take place. 

I have since switched health practices, been off of anti psychotics for 21 months, and have a much more professional psychiatrist who truly cares for my well being. I am still worried if I sustained any form of brain damage due to the medication I was on. I was on seroquel for nearly 4 years and I am truly fearful that my brain will never reach it's full potential due to what I ""had"" to take.
