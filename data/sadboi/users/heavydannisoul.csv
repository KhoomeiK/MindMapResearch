I’m planning my wedding, and I’m receiving a lot of pushback from my parents. That made me realize that I’ve never had anything be “for me”. My birthdays were always about inviting their friends over to have adult parties, I never went to grad... everything that’s supposed to be special were full of things I had to compromise on. 

I try and give joy to everyone else and live through that though. I do valentines cards and Christmas cards for my friends. I try and make a big deal on my fiancé’s birthday (this year sucked) and I’m always making sure everyone is comfortable when I host friends at my place. 

I just wish I could have that “for me” day once..."

My MIL said that she’s ready to come in between my mom and I on the day if it comes to it. 

Thanks for your well wishes. I keep jumping between excitement and fear that everything’s going to go wrong."
insaneparents,fqan331,t1_fqamec5,1589221864.0,"Acknowledging her faults really sets her off. I remember being a kid and asking my parents to stay sober for one of my birthdays.... That was definitely a bad idea. I’ve been debating on sending a message to my dad seeing if he could talk to her, he’s a little more reasonable. We were able to reach a compromise on the date that way. 

I don’t necessarily want to go no contact, but we do plan on lessening our contact with my parents after the wedding. My fiancé and I both plan on starting school in September, so at least we’ll have a reason to talk to them less. 

Thank you for your reply, thanks to everyone that’s replied. It makes me feel a little less insane to have people agree with me.

EDIT: by compromising on the date, I mean our date choice was June 1, my mom wanted September because that’s when her wedding was and “we need time”, and after talking to my dad we decided on June 6, the Saturday after our 5th anniversary."
insaneparents,fqamdxh,t1_fqaley0,1589221527.0,"I’m slowly learning that. I get crazy anxiety whenever I stand up to my parents, they talk down to me like a child and it makes me feel powerless. 

The most important part of my wedding is to have my parents be there and proud of me, but it’s not looking like I’m getting that wish fulfilled. 

How do I stop my parents from controlling me like this? I don’t even know where to start. I learned how to be assertive in my counselling sessions, but it feels like that disappears whenever it’s a conflict with either parent."

insaneparents,fqa14k4,t1_fq9yepw,1589210923.0,"Thank you for the suggestion. :) 

I’ve been in individual counselling for a few years now, and I’m currently in a DBT class to learn to manage my emotions better. I’ve tried to get my parents to do family counselling, my dad doesn’t believe in it unfortunately. My mom had an individual counsellor for a bit, but they referred her to a CBT course and she just stopped because she “doesn’t need it,” which I disagree with but whatever. 

My fiancé is already annoyed with my mom. He also sees an individual counsellor, and I’ve suggested he brings it up with her, and keep communicating with me. 

I’m still really afraid of my parents I’ve noticed. I know they don’t have any hold on me anymore, but I’m still so worried that I’ll say something and they’ll end up hurting me, physically or emotionally. There’s a time where my mom pulled a knife on me that haunts me to no end and I’m worried she’ll snap like that again. 

Sorry for the long wall of text."
insaneparents,fq9w5zh,t3_ghomyb,1589208236.0,"I’m not sure if I can put an explanation comment, but here’s a quick summary:

My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years. I’ve always had conflict with my parents so I moved in with him and his parents when I was 18, I’m almost 23 now. We decided to have a microwedding with just our parents present, and it’s been a huge headache planning it.

My mom was super excited about a wedding for like, two seconds. She’s guilted me because my grandma is “devastated” that I’m getting married without a big wedding. My dad offered to take us to view the venue, and my mom complained the whole ride there that it was too far and too expensive, even though my parents haven’t contributed to cost. She made me change the date from our fifth anniversary to something less meaningful so she doesn’t have to miss work. 

In front of other people though, she’s being super helpful. She asked lots of questions about the venue and offered to make decorations and food for us while we were there.

TLDR; the emotional whiplash from my parent regarding my wedding is way too much"
Weddingsunder10k,fq6iby2,t3_gh2yti,1589132083.0,"We are currently at 1k for our microwedding! We originally had a September wedding planned with a budget of about 5k, but this is working a lot better.

My MIL is making me a tulle skirt, and I bought a bridal top off of Etsy for $40. We bought a matching boutonnière and crown on Etsy for $50, they’re both faux sunflowers. My fiancé has a kilt, so he’s wearing that. One of my MIL’s friends offered to buy us flowers, so we’re doing a small brides bouquet ($65) 

We looked at non traditional venues, and found a barn for $200 for the day. My mom is making appetizer platters, and we ordered a small cake, which was our biggest expense. ($150) We ordered enough things to set one table, which was $50 on amazon (I found a sequin tablecloth that I just had to have, which made that part a bit more expensive) We were looking to rent an arch, but we decided to make our own triangle arch instead. I’m buying sunflowers and tulle off of amazon to decorate it. 

In total, we have 8 people attending. My parents, my brother, and my fiancé’s parents are the guests. My best friend got ordained and is marrying us. We’re streaming the wedding through Facebook live through a Facebook group. We sent out 30 announcements to family, which cost $32 with rush shipping from Vistaprint. 

We’re expecting some last minute expenses, but nothing too crazy. We wanted a small wedding but felt pressured into a big one, so it was really nice to have an excuse through COVID to do what we want. :)"

BPD,fnzjg7a,t3_g4kgws,1587395240.0,"I’m 22, and I’ve felt this way a lot. I wanted to be a lawyer out of high school, went to do a philosophy degree and dropped out after one semester lmao. 

Anyways, something I did that helped me solidify my beliefs and interests a bit was to write everything down when I was feeling “normal”.  I made a sheet and separated it into values, interests, and traits. I wrote down everything that came to mind, and it was all over the place, but there was a common theme in there. I used the values I wrote down to find a career that would align with my values and interests.  (I asked lots of people for input on this) 

It honestly felt like creating a character for myself to play. I stray a lot from the path I chose, but I always force myself to get back on track. It feels like I’m faking it a lot, but at least I can follow a plan outwardly while my brain does dumb stuff. 

I hope this helps a bit :)

Edit: I haven’t started post secondary again, but I read that you said you had a lot of anxiety in school. My city has services for disabilities that BPD made me eligible for.

I mostly worked with 10-14 year olds, and I loved working with them more than anything. I found I could relate to them well and they came to me for advice a lot, and I was able to do some awesome relationship building and help them with resources and stuff.

I had challenges with the job though. I found I was becoming a little obsessive over my job. I couldn't stop thinking about what we were gonna do next or how their lives were going. I was really attached and it felt like every waking moment of my life was about work,even though I was only doing 35hrs a week.

I also found it hard to work in general, as I've noticed that stress makes my BPD traits come out a little more. My schedule wasn't consistent, which definitely added to the stress pile up.

We started by separating my bangs from my hair and cutting them to sit on the front of my face. We separated them from the rest of my hair, and dyed everything but the bangs with a 2B permanent dye. 

We bleached the bangs twice with 20vol peroxide to get them light enough for the colours to stay. 

The rainbow colours are a mixture of the Wella Colourcharm dyes, and Ion colour brilliance dyes. 

I love my new hair, and I hope everyone enjoys it too!"

I was inpatient for five weeks, and honestly I have to say that being inpatient is the best thing you could have done for her. Thank you for taking charge and putting her mental health as a priority. She’ll thank you one day, when she’s better. They’ll take care of her and develop a short term care plan. Just keep supporting her, as long as it’s not taking a toll on your own health. You’re a good guy."

Hopefully you find someone to gift the tickets to. I’m in a Facebook trench group, I could cross post this there if you’d like, if you can’t find someone."
