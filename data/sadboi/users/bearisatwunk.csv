In the middle of the circle was two guys playing a very intense game of rock paper scissors.

As someone with fragile mental health, it severely stunted my recovery. It was on and off, but I officially split with him two/three years ago. No name calling, nothing, just told him I need to focus on myself. He said it was all okay, he respected it, but the next thing I knew he’s told pretty much the entire school about how toxic I am and how I was a total asshole. And they all believed him. It still fucks with me because he STILL talks shit about me to this day.

She flies into a paranoid fit of rage thinking I’m taking Adderal. At 10 pm. When I already took adderal in the morning.

Another time I was taking Nyquil and my brother was on the phone, to which he said out loud: “Hold on, I’m gonna watch my brother down the whole bottle of Nyquil and get buzzed off it, he’s pretending to know how much he’s supposed to take.”

They won’t even put me on antidepressants, which I desperately need, because Adderal and birth control = already way too many pills. Apologies for this turning into a rant. I’ve lost therapy privileges so it’s hard to find a good outlet nowadays."
