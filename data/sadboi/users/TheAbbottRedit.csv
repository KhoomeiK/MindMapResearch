Anxiety,ew45rxm,t3_cmrefg,1565103461.0,"Agreed. Explaining Anxiety/Depression to people who have never really felt it is like trying to explain an Orgasm to someone who has never had one. I get those questions all the time or, better yet, helpful advice on how to ""get over it"" or ""just be happy"". Hopefully as the knowledge base expands into the future that people at least have a better grasp of the concept of Anxiety."
depression,ew1dv0m,t3_cmcier,1565021260.0,"I hear you, I did that today. I worked up the courage to speak with my boss about my anxiety/depression. He was very understanding and told me it was all good and that I needed to take care of myself and to just let him know when I needed time. We will see if this turns out to be true or not and every situation/boss/employer is different but I was happy I did it for a couple reasons. 1. Now he knows and is given the opportunity to help and not have it come as a surprise. 2. If there is backlash or discrimination, I can deal with that more effectively. 3. and most importantly, I feel good about taking control of the situation and working to break that Stigma. It needs to go away. To my boss, I could have looked fine and hid it for months. By letting my boss know what is going on, maybe there will be an ""eye-opening"" moment where they think ""Wow, it didn't seem like anything had been wrong"" and in the future, people will be more assertive of changes in peoples behavior. We need to be able to discuss our problems openly, especially with people we are around every day and who have direct influences on our lives. I am with you Meh, some days are harder than others, and some days are too hard to deal with. A day off to re-group can certainly help and it should not always have to be because of the flue."
