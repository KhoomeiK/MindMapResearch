Some people can't bare the feeling of guilt, so they look for a way to not have to deal with that and sadly sometimes it means just more suffering for the kid. You can't be angry at that kind of people. Just pity them for the way they have to live in order to survive."

Who wants to live a life like that is a really, really hard but true question. It hits home a lot. For me the days are always too long. That's one of the saddest part. When I wake up in the morning, I am only waiting for night to come again, so I can forget all of this. I am waiting for the hours to just get by, so I can sleep, only to wake up the next day again and repeat that cycle. I am so tired of this."

I don't feel any desire to life but I have to stay for my family and every single day, I walk around with those horrible feelings but I still function like a body. I go grocery shopping, if I find the motivation, I cook, I watch movies, text with my friends or family. Then I get those moments where I don't know why I am actually still doing things. I am not interested in living this life any longer but it's like a robot mode, I can only switch off, when all my feelings and memories crash down on me. It really is too much. Everything is just too much."

When the evening comes my depression always gets really bad and I start to sink way deeper into my negative emotions than throughout the day. I don't know why. It happens especially often when I am not alone and the others go to sleep. I don't know why but when I am the only one awake, it gets really bad sometimes. It's like when I am alone I finally feel safe(?) enough to let my emotions out. Pretty complicated and I can't really explain it well."

It's more like I am scared for myself, I don't wanna do something wrong that I have to carry around for the rest of my life. I grew up with him, telling me over and over again that he is the best father you could have and that saying something wrong about him is like blasphemy, so I guess that kind of manipulation that he had done to me for 19 years straight still sit deep in me.

adultsurvivors,flaj6v6,t1_fla4oei,1584984943.0,"If I had younger siblings or knew that in our family, there are still little kids who visit him, I would definitely at least tell them about it but I am the youngest. One of my sisters is the only one who has kids and she is the one who knows. My family has already a screwed up relationship with my father as he was a very very bad emotional abuser and sometimes even physical, so there are only three siblings who still regularly talk to him and it's also about them, if I tell them the rest of their world will fall apart too. My sister hasn't been sleeping very well since, my mother who I needed to tell about it because I needed to know if she knew, also said she's been so stressed out and isn't able to sleep and  I don't know how I am supposed to handle this situation. I made the mistake by talking about it even though I wasn't really ready yet. I can't handle the memories and all well and I don't feel ready to tell anyone. I know it's not my fault and that he did what he did but like I said sometimes I really wonder if he even really knows what he did and I just feel like it's going to haunt me and make me feel bad if I really go to the police and I already feel so much negative emotions. The possibility of him hurting another kid is quite small as he has no access to children's that much but I am still scared. I know if he ever did something to another kid, I wouldn't be able to live with that. Most of my siblings feel like something has happened to them too. They have no memories but they had done a lot of things I had done too and it's not that unimaginable. If they could remember this would be something completely different. They probably wouldn't hesitate a second to put him into prison or a mental facility. They don't know about what he did to me but they already wish our mother would've put him behind bars when she had the chance to, many years ago. It's just that my father was a very manipulating person and I  mean one of this movie like manipulators. He could tell you, you were a unicorn in real life and you would doubt yourself a bit. It sounds ridiculous but that's the way I grew up and until I was 17, I did not doubt him at all. Over the course of the last 3 years, after I had run away and moved out at 17 because of his emotional abuse, I started realizing slowly that the way he raised me wasn't a way to raise a child. The sexual abuse was something I always remembered but I had surpressed far enough that it was almost not there and when it did came back, I was able to push it away right away until 2 months ago, it finally hit completely and I wasn't able to make it go away anymore. I have this mechanism that makes me dissociate from my emotions and it's my coping mechanism. When this goas away, it has happens twice, I lost it. My sister and my mother are pressuring me into telling all my siblings and then go to the police but I feel not ready at all, I lose all my shit when I let the memories and feelings take over and I don't know have a clue how I am supposed to talk about it to the police, strangers who I will have to tell all those horrible things. Just like I said, I know it was his actions but I just don't want to burden myself with more. You say you felt relieved and I am scared that I will not feel that way if I do it. What if I feel even more worse? I don't think I can handle any more."
adultsurvivors,fl9pl25,t1_fl9n89y,1584965441.0,"I know how you feel. My sister doesn't understand it too and thinks I should report him but I think most people don't consider the consequences of this kind of actions. Yeah, I was a child and he did things he never should've done but making him pay by going to prison or a mental facility feels more like revenge to me, then justice. He already destroyed and controlled so many things in my life, I don't wanna walk around with being responsible for destroying a life too. I am happy to know that there is someone who understands this. I really am."

Well, my other siblings are all older than me (I am the youngest 😅) but I just don't feel like letting everyone know because of a few different reasons. I know if another kid would be hurt by him, I don't think I could ever live with that but I really don't feel well and steady enough to more or less announce it to the whole town when I go to the police and now I am just stuck between me, not being able to even handle the memories and me, feeling like it's my responsibility to make him go behind bars (which he probably wouldn't as he is very mentally ill, so I guess he would be held in a mental facility). Me too. I really thought about my mother maybe experiencing something similar but I guess I will never know. She is never gonna speak about it.

I will definitely keep my siblings safe and I am actually the only one with memories but a few of my siblings have to deal with the same feeling that something probably has happened to them and it makes me feel a type of anger, I've never felt before.

No one deserves that and I hope you know that it was never your fault. Never. And you not wanting to leave your childrens alone with her is completely understandable. After such harsh and cold words, I wouldn't either. I am really happy too that my sister is very supportive. I knew she would believe me as everyone knows that our father is a monster. I do not feel like telling my other siblings about that yet but my sister is making me feel pressured. I know she doesn't mean harm and she tells me that it's okay if I am not ready but still, she tells me that he needs to be behind bars before he could destroy another life of a kid or that my other siblings would be so angry that I would've let them talk to him from time to time and not telling them what he did. It's a little bit too much right now but I am still very thankful for her. My mother is more of a person who ignores every problem, so I don't think she will speak about it much but my sister is definitely enough :)

Thank you. I wish you just as much healing and love for yourself as you deserve, which is a lot. You are not to blame. Never were, never will be.

Sometimes I think it would feel good to let it all out and I try to think about the things that make me really sad, like things that happened in my past but all I get is teary eyes. I am never able to get past that point as I, as silly as it sounds, start to yawn everytime and get interrupt because of it or I can't stay concentrated and suddenly without me realizing I am thinking about a totally different topic.

My parents, especially my father was a very very bad manipulator from my earlier childhood until my teenage years, he abused me emotionally, sometimes even physical and when I was 11 he sexual abused me until I was 16. I was just like you trained to idolize him, as if he was God and saying even one bad word about him was like blashempy. So all the words he said, all the times he pushed me, slapped me and all the things we would do, I believed him when he said I deserve it and that we love each other and no one can know. He is the most horrible person I've ever met. I also don't remember much of my childhood but I know when I was a little girl, something happened. I don't know if it was my biological producer or someone else but I know for sure there was something. I am really sorry you had to go through something as horrible as this. I really am. I know how that feels and even though my mental health is really really bad but still somehow I am able to function at least quite good, considering my poor mental health. I guess somehow you can just kind of start the autopilot and it looks like you are functioning normal but it's probably just a coping mechanism. It's at least for me.

I really do know it's not easy, heck for me it was too hard as I was ready to end it all instead of reaching out to them and get help. But you should really take care of your health. I dropped out of college last year, two months in the second year just because I had pushed my limits so bad that it ended up in a suicide attempt. I never really cared for myself, let the sh and depression and suicidal thoughts have their way with me and now I turn 20 and have to live with my sister because I am just not able to live alone because I am incapable of taking care of anything, including myself. So I really think you should reach out, it doesn't have to be everyone immediately but maybe someone close to you, a friend or a teacher that you trust, where you can start opening up if you don't feel ready to tell your parents yet.

I am always amazed how our species is completely satisfied with just working until they die, so that they could buy the things they so desperately need. Aren't there enough examples of people, who dedicated their live to money and ended up so miserable that you couldn't even hate them anymore and only pity them. Everyone is so okay with nothing. I used to be that angry. I used to hate them all so bad for making me feel so unbelievable sad because I imagined a world that was way different from how it is. Now, there is nothing more than sadness inside me. I feel so sad for all of them. They find there purpose in a job, in pride and it's all they will ever know. I see the young people, walking around the streets, drinking, yelling and it makes me so sad that no one ever taught them to love themselves and its heartbreaking when you really look into the face of people. No one is smiling and they faces look so worn out and so sad. It's breaking my heart. I don't know how I am supposed to go on. I always had the plan of moving far away, into nature. I really don't care about having no internet anymore or needing to provide myself with good and warmth and light. As long as I don't have to life in this sad society. But sadly I know it's not gonna change much. I might be able to have peace, be one with nature again but the pain won't leave because me not seeing the pain doesn't mean it isn't still there. The world will still be so cruel and I hate that I have no power to change it. I know if the world does ever change, it probably won't be in my life time and I know I can't carry on in this way.

I know it's hard with not wanting to disappoint people, wanting to get it over and just the fear of not doing anything but I think if the people that love you could decide between you, taking a break or maybe wasting money on a major that maybe wasn't yours or you working until you break yourself or even worse, they would definitely decide for the first one."

My life is pretty bad right now and my family is actually seriously messed up and sadly for many years, the thought of suicide became natural to me. There is like really no day where I don't think at least once about wanting to die. It doesn't matter in what kind of mood I am, when I drive past a bridge, I can never stop myself from thinking wanting to jump off the bridge or drown myself in the river beneath me. I don't know if people really know how horrible it is to feel like everyday you would rather be dead than alive. Really hope things get better for you some day."

A few years ago I used to choke myself with a scarf until I felt really dizzy and my arms just stopped and I couldn't walk straight anymore and every sound sounded completely weird and I had no sense of direction and I felt a bit like I was high or something.

I always had a negative view on medications because I thought I wouldn't be myself anymore and I never liked the thought of needing something like that because you are so far down that you just can't get out alone anymore and need those but I've been considering them for a whole now.

My father not only sexually assaulted me for years but he used every chance to tell me how worthless I am, that I am a piece of shit and that I am dead inside and should not get close too others because I destroy everything. Just want to let you know, parents are only humans. They are no gods and nothing they say has to be true. Parents who hurt their child they should love, just hate themselves much more and I know it's hard to believe but most of the time, they are really talking more about themselves as they would ever to you. You might feel like nothing but you are not nothing. You are more than you might think. I like to use the Metapher of a flower. Everyone has a flower inside them and some never find the beauty in themselves and the flower will wait all its life to bloom and those who find that flower inside them inspire not only themselves but those around them to start searching for that flower too."

Sadly, I've this side where I would rather starve instead of asking someone for help, which might result out of my family always making me feel guilty for everything I asked. It's kind of my only energy source. I don't want anyone's help, so I try and I won't stop until I break down fully. I just hate to depend on others.
To be honest, for me, if this life doesn't change I am seriously gonna go crazy. I can't live with just ok moments. I had a dream when I was a little child and this dream turned into a goal and I know if I won't be able to achieve that, then there is no reason for me to stay."

I know I am still young but it doesn't change the fact, that since I was 11 I've been walking around with those feelings. My childhood was crappy, my father sexually assaulted me for years, my mother is a cold women that doesn't know how to show warmth and Ive been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, bpd, ocd and ptsd and with all those freaking memories and all those feelings, it just seems impossible to ''just'' take advantage of my youth and do something.

The world, we humans build is a world that consists of money, greed, pride, hate anger and sadness, so if I fail at becoming like them, it's something I will definitely celebrate but for me since I was little I wanted to be a person that lives with her heart, loving and understand and one with nature and the one or other would think it is dumb or silly but I don't care. I wanna find myself no matter how many people tell me, no one knows and no one will ever know. They boundaries are not mine.

Yeah, you are 100% right, deadlines never help you, like really never and I know that too. When I was younger I imagined myself as a person, who is really living with her heart, loving and understanding everything and everyone, one with nature.

I really believe in the saying that if you really want something, you can do it and I know there are some things I am really good at and even things that I enjoy but I've been wanting to die ever since I was 12 years old. My family is the only reason why I am still here because I knew how much damage I would do. Tried it twice anyway but sadly survived. It's like the little Joy I feel, seeing my family or doing what I like, is just not enough to fill this big hole inside me, that just wants to die because everything just seems so pointless and meaningless. If someone gave me the opportunity to press a button, where my existence will be erased from everyone's mind and I can die, I wouldn't hesitate a second.

No one understand my euphoria when I slept until 2 to 3 pm because they don't understand, that for me, it means less hours to get by.

But I am so happy for you that you are making progress and it's gonna be a long and hard journey but I am sure that you will be able to overcome it all.

Sharing just feels so impossible to me. I know that many, if not all, who experienced something like this feel ashamed and I've always known that it was never their fault because nothing what you can do, gives anyone the right to overstep limits and do such horrible things. I just didn't know how to feel about it all because it seemed like I didn't have such a problem with that but right now I think that maybe I was just too young to understand that what he did was not normal and maybe that's why I felt more or less okay with it. I can't recall anyone telling me in my childhood about those kind of boundaries that shouldn't be overstepped or a certain way of behavior I should be aware of. I guess that plus me, experiencing something similar when I was very young thought this way maybe I could get love from him? It sound so crazy and somehow sick but a child's mind works way easier and at the same time way more complicated than a adults mind. I've read about kids who often mistake this kind of abuse with love and it just sounds so fucked up but there is probably some truth to it.

You are definitely right. Being kind to each other can help. Thanks to you, I feel like my fear of telling someone else reduced a bit and for the first time I feel like I might be able to talk about it with my therapist some time in the future, so there is no way I could show you how thankful I am right now. And if you ever need to talk, I will be ready to listen and I wish you the best luck on your way to recovery and for all that comes after it."

As I got older and started to learn that it is not normal, I started to feel uncomfortable and when I talked with one of my sisters she actually told me that he once came into the bathroom while she was bathing and told her that her body looked so grown up and I realized more and more that this is definitely not normal but I could never allow myself to really think about it because I always knew how people tell about their past experience, saying how how horrible they felt about what happened and I was just like....okay with it somehow. Many people also thought often we were a couple and so I thought, maybe I am giving of this vibes. What if I am the one who started this? Can I even say then that it felt like abuse. I was and still am just so confused about it all and I am already seeing therapist and she knows quite a bit about my father but I never went in that kind of direction ever. I just wanna deal with it on my own. Just heal myself without help because I just really don't wanna talk to anyone about it from face to face or when I know that person.

I always stopped myself from thinking about it because I felt so ashamed but right now, writing all of this out and reading your answer, I don't know exactly what to feel but I feel like I've awakened a storm inside that has been asleep for most of the time.

I know I shouldn't care about what other people might think about me but it's hard to let go of that when you have been judged a lot and live in a world/society that judges every move you do. I am currently actually not working. I just dropped out of college because of some heavy stuff but I felt like showing my scars in school would never be an option. It would've been just too uncomfortable and I guess I got the problems of not wanting to seem weak. I know, in the end, it is more likely weak to hide because of a potential fear but I was always the strong one, the friend who got called ''therapist'' and it feels like people will see that I am not as strong as I pretend to be and I just feel like, showing them is like having one of your worst moments in life, tattooed on your forehead for everyone to see. Sadly I am also a very sensitive person, so I get hurt pretty fast, which just makes me feel even more afraid.

Thank you for this very kind words. I know you are right and that my goal should be to start embrace and love myself rather than thinking about what other people might think.
