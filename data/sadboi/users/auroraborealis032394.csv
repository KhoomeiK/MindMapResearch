I am absolutely convinced that when I needed size 6 pants as a 12 year old, she took me to the petite old ladies section as an excuse to expand her closet, because she never let me get clothes I liked or fit in with my peer group. When I got older and left non seasonal items at home, I‚Äôd come back and find half my summer wardrobe gone. It was so infuriating when we wore the same size. I was always so glad when her weight fluctuated WAY off mine so I could stop crying about her taking my shit. 

She‚Äôd also just rearrange my entire desk and book case while I was gone and it made me so mad because I had EVERYTHING sorted, but she‚Äôd say she had to clean my room even though I left it clean when I‚Äôd go back to school.  It really has a way of making you feel like nothing is safe."

Unfortunately with pwBPD, the high impulsivity plus fear of abandonment sometimes leads to more dire attempts than others. _unfortunately_ you likely won‚Äôt know which it is until it‚Äôs too late. 

Out of the 6+ attempts during my sophomore year of high school, only one was truly life threatening. Of the 5 or so since I went to college, 1 was life threatening, but likely survivable. The problem is that while often predictable in their behavior patterns, our parents with BPD are more likely to use whatever they can get their hands on, see: impulsive behavior. 

That said: you have to live your life. Any decision she makes is out of your hands and not all your fault. You don‚Äôt need to set yourself on fire to keep her warm, and the financial help you do give her is already more than she should be asking for.  You are your own person with your own ambitions, hopes, and dreams for the future, not an extension of your parent. Trying to predict which attempt might be the serious one will just keep you feeling constantly anxious if you let it."

Luckily my partner knew better than to respond and blocked her but it sent my anxiety into overdrive. I‚Äôve essentially blocked her on everything since even a text message or a phone call makes me anxious. My bpd mom is actually why I can‚Äôt answer the phone anymore if I don‚Äôt recognize the caller.   She then got ‚Äúupset‚Äù and decided to fly across the country and just. Be on my doorstep on a weekend I was supposed to be out of town for several days.  I felt so violated that she could do that. 

You‚Äôre not alone that you feel unsafe. The apartment I wound up moving to later has a gated entry, plus a locked door, on top of a multi locked door.  It‚Äôs the only way I feel safe and secure in my home anymore. Obviously barring your ability to move, if your door doesn‚Äôt have secondary locks, having additional locks (like a chain) might be helpful. I wish I had answers for how you feel safe again, but until there is a definitive end I think the worry remains because we know what our parent with bpd is capable of :/ I had moved and not told my parent where (yay! Increased feelings of safety), but unfortunately I sued my abuser in civil proceedings and then she got my address again :/ 

All this is to say so many of us understand how you feel. And it‚Äôs not impossible to get to feeling safe again. It just takes time. I‚Äôm so sorry that this happened though, and I hope the nightmares stop soon.
