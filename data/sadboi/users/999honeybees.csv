AmItheAsshole,fmx2n4y,t3_fxrz45,1586457369.0,"I think YTA because it’s your friend’s body and your friend’s tattoo. A painting like that is a beautiful gift that likely took hours to make. So, what, he should just throw it away and pretend he never got it? I obviously can’t speak for this situation but breaking up with an ex doesn’t always have to mean deleting every picture and get rid of every object they gave you. Especially when it’s something she worked so hard on. And as for telling his new girlfriend where the image came from, is it her business? It’s his body. Clearly the image is very important to him. I don’t think it should be off limits just because of where it came from."

AmItheAsshole,fc503b9,t1_fc4zu5o,1577436213.0,"He can make an okcupid or something. Just because OP has single friends doesn’t mean she owes him an introduction. You also ignored the part where she said she wouldn’t recommend that her friends date him. Her bedroom door is never unlocked! As his roommate she’s surely spent enough time with him to make that call. She even offered to wingman him, which is kind and more than she owes him. She doesn’t have to do anything she’s uncomfortable with. NTA"

TrueOffMyChest,facveh8,t3_e8c1qr,1575947979.0,being enslaved is not the same as being called a cracker at the bus stop. black people are still suffering because of the racism deeply deeply ingrained in our society. as white people it’s not enough for us to be not racist. we have to be anti racist. it may seem invisible to you but it’s very real and the only way it well ever end is through action. being called a slur < a lifetime of racism.

bipolar,f6hfqs9,t3_dr969u,1572846465.0,"Memory loss is something i’ve struggled with intensely. Before I was on meds (and even now sometimes) but especially when I was smoking weed / drinking, I constantly felt like I was days behind the rest of the world or like I was living somebody else’s life. It’s so hard because it makes you so unreliable and such a bad listener so you screw up your close relationships. Then there’s forgetting appointments, never getting anything done because you forgot, etc."
