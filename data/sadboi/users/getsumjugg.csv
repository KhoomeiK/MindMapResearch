u_dirtyfrankie2002,fembzes,t3_ehjxpl,1579247883.0,"i get some of this, my communication is if you didnt hear me the first time then fuck you, i also struggle with substance abuse, my DoC is amps, bennies, and granja. depending on how low the low is ill also drink until i cant get up. i grew up hating weak people also because my great pop was on he uss austroia \[not sure how to spell} and his son was my first role model should be as in if i became him id have life by the balls. i was diagnosed with ADD (thank whatever higher power that gave me add and nit the hyperness plus zooming thoughts) and thats a shitty mix bipolar depression, not religious but im big time bless i wasnt born like that. i think the murderous thoughts come from bipolar cause i go through the same thing. i dont talk to anyone unless the can write a script cause like you i cant stand to be sober and deal with the evilness. my best advice when talking to psychiatrist is be honest about your symptoms, including the bloody thoughts but make it clear they are mere thoughts that you can ignore or youll get the i love me jacket.... ps on the pro tip if you romanticize your tribulations then write a book or a script,thats what mom did and she says it helps her get things off her chest that she doesnt want to say out loud and from what i understand schizophrenia CAN not saying it 100% does cause im not sure but it could boost creative. i really hope you see this and it makes you feel netter that theres others out here theres even more than me you just gotta find us although most are as open as me . you seem more serve than i but with enough time and actively changing your behavior i think you can do a nice 180. i was skeptical about meds until i seen my mom off hers for a week and its like summer to winter you feel? i hope something out of the book helped you out bro, i know im 17 or 18 days late but have a good night and i hope get the help you need and please feel free to dm me its refreshing to talk to people how go through similar and can even take your mind of the symptoms in my experience, brief sure but you dont know how good it feels to get lost in conversation with someone with similar issues cause sometimes it feels like you known each other for a long time, the familiarity is what is comforting, any ways it 3 on the east coast so goodnight bruv"
