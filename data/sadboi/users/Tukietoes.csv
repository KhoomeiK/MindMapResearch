What does it for me is me telling myself that ""I feel it, therefore it is so"" is a ridiculous assumption.  I deconstruct and put the lie to depressed reasoning. It goes something like this:

     Ugh I hate myself and I don't want to get out of bed.

     Why? What's different from last week when you got   up and did some things?

     Oh fuck it leave me alone I feel like shit.

     Again, why? What gives today the power to make you feel this way? You're doing it to yourself.

So that's what works for me.  Also I had my first TMS treatment today. Praying that it works. Does Canadian insurance cover it?"

You don't have to tough it out; you can take it on and tell them exactly what they're doing to you. You can tell them that going to see them is not good for you right now.  People who don't treat me with support and validation lose their ""me privileges"" until I decide if they've earned them back. Your emotions are precious jewels that you shouldn't share with someone who is careless and thoughtless.  Lots of love. ♥️♥️♥️♥️"
