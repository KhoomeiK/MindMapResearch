mentalhealth,fhio4hh,t3_f36vf1,1581628535.0,"If you can afford it I recommend some counselling. I've been going on/off for about 10 years and its changed my life, but in a gentle way. I struggled in my early 20's with anxiety, to the point of ending up in hospital with a heart problem. I always feel better coming out of therapy sessions, even if only in subtle ways. Meditation also helped me, I downloaded an app called Headspace which helped me sleep. It takes a little concentration and practice. Where you are is not an easy place to be, it feels very alone and uncontrollable sometimes. But there is a way out, believe you are good enough."

My big fear is the judgement/embarrassment associated with it, and also that if I let go then what secrets I'm liable to let out to someone else."
