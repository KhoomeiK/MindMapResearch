Anger,fpr2m11,t1_fpqfjms,1588840171.0,"No problem at all. I went through this about a year and a half ago, dealing with extreme anxiety and panic attacks and long depression spells, and finally admitting that I needed help (i.e. therapy and medication) was a tough step to take. It‚Äôs one I‚Äôm making again actually to cope with a relapse. It‚Äôs definitely okay for you to focus on what you need and how to help yourself right now without being too bothered about other people‚Äôs opinions (which I know is hard with anxiety ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). 

Best analogy someone told me when I was having a hard time admitting I needed time/help to recover: if you broke your leg, no one would expect you to walk right away; if you got seriously ill with the flu, no one would expect you to leave the hospital ASAP. Mental illness is the same, just not physically visible (though it can take a toll on your physical health); you have just as much of a right to take the time to care for yourself and get the help you need to heal. 

There‚Äôs no shame in doing whatever it is you need to do to be well, so that you can be better and stronger to be there for others. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
depression,fpqdjgz,t3_gemzwi,1588820389.0,"I know exactly how you feel. One thing I figured out much too late is I was continually the last person on anyone‚Äôs mind because (to be frank) they were not the first on mine. I didn‚Äôt take initiative to check in, catch up, be there for them. Yes, a lot of that is depression and avoiding talking to my friends/family during dark periods. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.

One thing that helps is just being around, just sending a message, even when you‚Äôre in a dark place. It helps you take a few seconds off from spiraling and it lets the other person know you‚Äôre thinking about them too. Friendship and connection has to work both ways, even when your end isn‚Äôt feeling so great. 

It took me about 6-9 months to build a stronger connection with two of my friends. Currently in a shame/anger/guilt/depression hole but the difference between this one and the last one is (1) I have two friends that don‚Äôt ‚Äúget weird‚Äù when I get quiet, (2) I‚Äôm still their go-to person for catch ups every week and (3) I can be completely honest with them when I can‚Äôt be as responsive which helps massively.

1. Do you have trusted friends/family who you can talk to openly about this? 
 
2. Have you considered or are you in counseling? 

3. Do you have healthy strategies in place to cope with high stress/anxiety?

Anger,fpqbjgs,t3_geww0s,1588819156.0,"Hi, 

A lot of what you describe makes me think that your anger is probably connected to something deeper that‚Äôs bothering you. I am glad that you mentioned therapy as that can be a great first step in getting to the root of the problem. Don‚Äôt be put off if you‚Äôre uncomfortable for a while or if you feel like you need to try out 2 or more therapists to find one that works for you. It‚Äôs not uncommon.

Therapy will help you understand why you‚Äôre angry and develop strategies that work for you to handle fits of anger in a more positive way. It‚Äôs also sometimes just good to let it out with a person who is not only objective but actively invested in helping you overcome your issues. (Sometimes I forget that part in therapy sessions.) 

Good luck, and in the meantime, the thing I find works best for me when I get angry and am about to burst is literally walking away. I turn on my heels and engage myself in something different in a new space (watch tv, read, clean something, etc): the key is to focus solely on the new thing, let it completely take over your brain space and whatever you do try not to stew on what made you angry."

Anger,foydxw7,t3_ga46wu,1588170762.0,"I know how you feel. In a nutshell it boils down to an inability to relinquish control. It can stem from any number of things. For me, it‚Äôs based on growing up with a family who was always late and didn‚Äôt care much about my needs/opinions. When I finally was able to control how I was treated and how I lived, I controlled EVERYTHING. 

Be warned, if left unchecked or the root of the problem is not addressed it may transition into taking anger out on animate things. From personal experience, I waited too long to do counseling and medication, and it‚Äôs made it harder to unlearn bad coping strategies and the control issues. Not to say it‚Äôs impossible to overcome, but the sooner you seek out the additional help that works for you to address your issues, the easier it is to unlearn habits that don‚Äôt help you maintain balance.

Wishing you all the best. You can learn to deal with the control issues in a healthier way. :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,fou0sae,t3_g9gekh,1588072806.0,"I am so happy for you. I quit teaching after last school year. I am coming up to one full year since I stopped working (June 15, 2019). 

During my three years working at my new school (2016-2019), I was slowly deteriorating mentally and physically to the point where I had a mental breakdown in February 2019. I took a month off of work and managed to come back to school and make it to the end of the school year from March to June. 

I was on a consistent plan and on the mend and then my mom died at the end of June 2019. There‚Äôs been too many ups and downs to feel like the year off has helped; in some ways it has, but in others it has proven that I am in need of much longer than a year to recuperate. 

I‚Äôm working again (an at-home writing job) which helps keep the demons at bay, as I feel like I‚Äôm being productive, but I don‚Äôt have to navigate through other people‚Äôs needs/emotions as much as I did when I was teaching. 

Anyway I‚Äôm sorry that was long. Even though we‚Äôve never met, your post made me feel so much pride and happiness for you. I am so happy to see an example of someone who makes me feel like I can hope for something better someday too. Thank you for sharing your story.

Anger,folm67o,t1_fojihj8,1587865263.0,"Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. It really helps having an objective opinion from someone who has gone/is going through something similar. From what you‚Äôve shared I think that what I am least consistent with is getting my anger out in a different way. Gotta find my metaphorical punching bag or Doom. 

I don‚Äôt cut people off per se, but I distance myself for a while. It‚Äôs not so hard because we live pretty far from our immediate family, so visiting and phone calls don‚Äôt happen every week. I do think that with my BIL, I tried to see it from his POV; that‚Äôs why I wrote him the apology letter. He was so dismissive and rude in his response, I think I‚Äôm just going to take a beat with him for a little while. 

How he reacted to a sincere apology, though not abusive, was petty and hurtful given (1) he is aware that I am still grieving my mother‚Äôs death and (2) he knows I struggle with anxiety and depression. For me that was inexcusable, and it‚Äôll take me a while to feel like we‚Äôre on good terms again.

Other than that, I‚Äôm keeping my immediate family and close friends close and keeping up contact more regularly ( those who want to be a part of my life and who can be at least somewhat forgiving of me given the current circumstances)."

I have done proofreading/editing work with a client on Reddit who needed help with his academic paper, and I would be happy to help you with your thesis. From what you‚Äôve written, it sounds like a pretty straightforward project with the first task related to summarizing an article with the appropriate paraphrasing/citations so as to pass the Turnitin plagiarism checker. The second task as I understand it is a run-through of basic editing/proofreading for sentence fluency, grammar, spelling, etc. If you would like to get in touch with my previous client as a reference of my work, I‚Äôd be happy to supply his contact information via direct message. I am sure that he will let you know that I am thorough, a problem-solver/critical thinker and have a meticulous eye for detail.

I am more familiar with APA citation than I am with Chicago style, so I would be refreshing my memory here; although, I do not see this as a huge problem that will be extremely time consuming to catch up on. With that said, I am confident that I can complete both tasks for you. My rate for this project would be on an hourly basis ($20/hr) as the task requires indefinite lengths of time in addition to editing already written content; for me, this is the easiest way to make sure that time spent on your project to complete it to the best of my ability is accounted for in its entirety. 

In addition to this, I can use my AND.CO account to draft an agreement for us to outline the expected services for the project and track time spent on the project for invoices in order to remain as transparent as possible for the duration of the project. (It also helps me keep an official record of paid work for financial/tax purposes.)

Please feel free to get in touch with me if you feel that I would be a good fit to collaborate with you on editing/proofreading your thesis.

I let my boss know I wasn‚Äôt coming back for the next teaching year (2019-2020) and ended my job in June 2019. Then my mom died at the end of that month.

Now, in spite of all of the craziness going on currently, I am finally back in a place where I can exist in the most basic terms more consistently and start to enjoy things I‚Äôve let go of for so long.

You would think this would be off-putting, and though it is hard to get used to at first, it draws you in; similarly to the book **Out of the Dust**. I'm still in the first parts of it, so I don't want to make too many assumptions/conclusions as of yet. However, I will say that so far it is VERY engaging.

Going to pick up **Men Without Women** by Ernest Hemingway (I've read a book of short stories with the same title by Haruki Murakami, so I'm curious to see if they share any similarities other than the title) and **So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish** by Douglas Adams this week after I've dived deep enough in **The Terrible**."

financialindependence,ff90kpq,t3_esb29b,1579701778.0,"If you're not miserable with what you're doing, and it gives you a sense of community, purpose and joy, I would stay right where you are!

I've gone through a similar thing on my end: 34F, married, no kids. Working internationally as a teacher making a decent salary. Good benefits. Good co-workers. If I hadn't spent three years being miserable in my last teaching job, I would've continued teaching. I have the luxury of being married to a husband who also teaches at the same international school, and he loves it. So I was able to take a step back, reassess and figure out what exactly it is that I need to do to (1) feel part of a community with purpose and (2) do something that I still love doing even when it's hard to do. 

For me, that's writing. So I've pivoted with the understanding that, yes, I'll probably not be the next JK Rowling or Neil Gaiman, but ***better*** ***yes***, I'll be much happier having control over my own schedule to do the thing I love to do everyday: write. 

This means that me and the hubs won't be reaching FI anytime soon, but RE in the literal sense (aka not working at all) was never the end goal for us. It was the actual freedom of time - to dedicate to creating and volunteering for causes we are passionate about (e.g. education, women's empowerment, helping the homeless, etc.).

Once we're in a place financially where we work for others and not for fundamental costs of living (aka working without needing to pay attention to the paycheck), then I know we'll have reached our own version of FIRE.

Sounds like you're in a good place, so if you're happy and your gut is telling you that where you are currently is actually where you want to be, I see no reason for changing careers.

All the best!"

I enjoyed Northanger Abbey a lot. There were times where it lulled for me a bit, but I think it may be because I haven‚Äôt read Austen in a while or books around that time period. 

I was firmly grounded in the setting when Catherine arrived in Bath because I‚Äôve visited there and could clearly imagine her living and socializing there. I also appreciated the very accurate depiction of her na√Øvet√© as she navigates friendships, romance and reality in a wider social circle.

It has the classic Austen humor which I love. Though I have to admit, at times, I missed the satirical aspects of Gothic style stories Austen was getting at. I‚Äôd definitely like to reread this one."
