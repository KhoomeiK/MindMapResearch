You could fall a dozen stories and not die, just breaking a few bones (there are videos of that, but graphic of course), having such a building at disposal is not possible for many people. And even if you have it, there are a couple other problems. 

1. You have to access a place high enough within the building to kill yourself, either you might be blocked by security, or you'd have to get a room in a hotel for example, which cost money people might not have. Even getting to the last floor won't assure you'll have an access to a window.
2. It's likely you won't jump as soon as you're close to the border. During that time people might see you and get in your way. Also, you can see the height. And that might be enough to stop a lot of people.

I won't blindly accept jesus' words without doubting them. I'd rather be wrong and corrected than accept without judgement. 

Jesus might not treat people on their sexual orientations, but he still limited his comment to heterosexuality.

He isn't worthy is a judgement on his incapacity to do something, therefore not fitting the definition of god.

Jesus doesn't accept everyone as they are, but everyone is as god made them. We need not to cut what offends god, because nothing should offend at all. If an immortal all-powerful being can be offended by mere humans of his creation, while he knew beforehand what would happen, he has no right to complain.
