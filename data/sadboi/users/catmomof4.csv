It’s never a pleasant conversation. Some days it eats me up and I don’t even want to get on Facebook because I see old classmates who still hang out together and have this deep bond and that’s something Ive never had."

houseplants,fjayl0q,t3_fcivts,1583183068.0,"I bought these three succulents about a year ago from Lowe’s. Up until last week they’ve been sitting in my south facing kitchen window where I thought they’d get plenty of sun. Well, the one in the middle (I’m sorry, I’ve forgotten their names) lost all its red color and some of the leaves shriveled up and fell off. The one on the left, same deal. I’ve now moved them to my living room window which is north facing. Maybe the indirect light will help. Should I repot them as the soil is a year old at this point? I’m just not sure how I can revive these guys. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/eOt7bw1.jpg) is what they looked like when I first bought them. You can really see how close I came to killing them lol. I don’t want to give up on these guys, do y’all have any suggestions?? Thanks!"

Idk how many days I’ll be working a week but I’ve been told my office is very busy and I will most likely hit my 90 days in no time.  Oh, and I also have a Prius as a daily that I could use as a back-up in case my Jeep is down.

GhostAdventures,f3dwdtu,t3_dglagk,1570849042.0,"My fiancé and I had just moved in to our current home. I was home alone as I hadn’t found a job yet since the move two weeks prior. I was crocheting at the kitchen table while singing along to Christmas music (it was around Thanksgiving) at about 4:30 PM. 
Suddenly our beagle jumped up from a dead sleep and came in from the living room and peeked around the corner to look into the kitchen. At about that same time, my Bluetooth speaker had random spurts of static in it and the fluorescent light in the kitchen started flickering. Our beagle took two steps further into the kitchen and sat down, seeming to watch something ahead of him that I couldn’t see. 
Where I was sitting at the table, my back was facing the wall. I suddenly felt a cold draft hit me, which I thought was odd as I had been crocheting at that table for at least 30 minutes and hadn’t felt a thing. Then I was hit with this sudden panicked feeling. My body felt very tense and I began looking over my shoulders expecting someone to be there. I backed up against the wall so nothing (no one?) could get behind me. Then I felt what I could only describe as a pressure on my forearm, like a palm was resting on it. No warm or cold feeling, just a pressure. As quickly as it came, the pressure left and the feeling of panic left as well. My music had no static, and our beagle went back to the living room to sleep. This whole scenario probably lasted 2 minutes start to finish. I immediately called my fiancé and asked when he would be home. I sat in that chair against the wall until he made it home two hours later. 
A few days later I found out that the former resident was an older lady who passed away in the home right after Christmas the previous year. We were the first people to move in since she passed. Nothing that significant has happened since (we’ve lived here two years now) but I will occasionally feel like I’m being watched and will have an overall creepy feeling."
