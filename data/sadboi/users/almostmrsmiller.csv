I think I've decided I'm tired of being bipolar. It's exhausting, family and friends don't really understand all of the symptoms and swings, and I'm tired of trying new meds. I would just like to be done with the bipolar thing now."

One thing that helps me is asking myself if that $20 knick knack is worth working an hour of my life away. Like ""work was crazy insanely almost throwing me into a manic cycle yesterday, did I really do an hour of that for this cute little vase?"" I've also started using ""if I'm not willing to steal (I don't actually steal but I say it) or wear it out of the store is it worth the money?"" Manic and money is my main thing.

bipolar,etbjhsj,t3_cavqba,1562648960.0,"What country are you in? Have you talked to the other person in your relationship about your feelings? Are you more suicidal or ""meh. Don't feel like living?"" I don't mean to ask a lot of questions, but I think that there are some points here that might be helpful to look at. If you really feel like your therapist isn't helpful that you can't talk to her about what's really going on then you should find another. Why bother paying and going if you're getting nothing from it? 

I think you need to be straight with your SO. You need to discuss if being in new country is worth it for you. You may love them, and they you, but if being in a new place is leading you to feel suicidal, then it shouldn't be worth the risk. I don't know how long you've been here, but you might try and find things that make you feel anchored. There are listings on FB that list local events, like local plays, a food truck cook off, a wine tasting with a crafts fair, ect.  I've dragged my husband to some of those and have met some interesting people.  

If you feel like you're drowning in it all, you need to find one thing you can grab on to. A new therapist, more sincere conversations with your partner, something that interests you...just something. Sweetie, you're too precious to not be here. We need you."
bipolar,et7qmzs,t1_et7511b,1562536067.0,"Oh! I love that one. And then the second you get upset it's ""why are you so fucking crazy? Are you taking your meds?"" As if it's impossible to still be upset while medicated. I'm not being manic..I'm pissed. And people using my diagnosis to explain it all makes me nothing but my diagnosis."
bipolar,esrdmyn,t1_espellk,1562222668.0,I went to a Christian school while I was finding/figuring out the bipolar thing. I tried asking for help..they just told me it was because I didn't pray enough. It took me a really long time to want to want anything to do with my faith again.
