fuckeatingdisorders,fo45xtq,t1_fo42x3n,1587498751.0,"In general, my family members view being skinny as something that will make you better.  Don't think they'd necessarily hate me for being fat, but I feel like they'd judge me a shit ton.  

I don't really care about how others look unless I'm comparming myself to them... idk letting go of wanting to be skinny seems impossible because at this point, my ed is one of the largest parts of me and the ed mindset has taken over every aspect of my life.  

I feel like even if I achieve the things I want to they'll be overshadowed by my weight and how terrible I look.  To your jeans comment, honestly I can't answer that with the answer that would be considered rational.  Clothing used to not be a trigger for me at all but recently it's become a huge trigger and it causes a lot of spirals for me.  

At this point, one of my biggest aspirations/wants, if not the biggest, is to be skinny."
