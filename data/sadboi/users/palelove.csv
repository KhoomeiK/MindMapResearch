Anxiety,fcwojkf,t3_ej29di,1578031693.0,"Other people have it worse right? Thats what i often hear and often question myself, what is my problem? Everything could be okay but its not. It feels so very far from okay.  Also, why is everyone else just able to handle ""life""? Am i the defective rat? Whats wrong with me? Am i just an overly sensitive millennial?

If you figure it all out let me know cause i am definitely drowning too."

 How do you sneak into government positions when your only experience is working a makeup company. 

The answer is money. And connections to sick people. 

Ill hold onto my palettes from my bfs mom for sentimental reasons and thats all."
