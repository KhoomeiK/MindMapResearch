BingeEatingDisorder,ffn2std,t1_fffhh67,1580061402.0,Yes it is
iamveryedgy,ffevbg2,t3_et4g5h,1579867094.0,Aye that actually went hard tho
bupropion,f8qni3l,t3_dz8xhn,1574720519.0,Yes! Lost 20 lbs in a period of a year
schizoaffective,f48db01,t3_djc638,1571436693.0,"Absolutely ://
I’ve found that when I take stimulants (like Vyvanse, for my BED) it makes tasks such as showering, cleaning, studying, just the small things that depression makes very hard.... a LOT more natural, like I don’t have to force myself.
But yes, the depression is always there. I can medicate as much as I want (and believe me I am) but truth is, it’s chronic. Each day is a fight, but that’s what makes life interesting, right ?"
memes,f3gx70p,t3_dgwi0h,1570916149.0,Liberal arts major: how can we make it fair & ethical & a benefit to ALL of society?
BingeEatingDisorder,f3dzsta,t1_f33rhzq,1570852149.0,"What stimulant were you given for your depression? I find those are the only things that help me. 
I understand where you’re coming from. Just know that life has no timeline. I used to stress and cry all the time thinking I was lost in life and that I had to have a plan then and there but as soon as I learned to live day by day, it took some time to adjust my mindset no doubt. But it is worth the try!! Each day is another chance to be better than yourself yesterday! 
Don’t listen to what others say about what’s attractive and what’s not, opinions are very subjective. And I can tell you, as an anthropology major, it is all cultural. Go somewhere else in the world and they view excess body weight attractive Bc it shows health and the ability to feed not only themselves but a child. 
I know you probably don’t care abt that lol. But my point is!!!: you are the only one to live for. You will find someone who loves you for you! No matter your weight of mental health. Just focus on working on yourself. If your friends make you feel bad abt yourself, perhaps find other friends! Find some that are more relatable to you, I promise they are out there :)"
EDAnonymous,f3b2zs7,t3_dgdmii,1570800239.0,"Agreed! Recently I went through my 1st heartbreak and had a hard time eating for a little more than a week, so I probably had an intake under 1000, maybe even 800. I’d be lying if I said that getting dumped encouraged me to be happy abt it & I actually started running at night to help me relieve some stress. 
DAE when someone hurts them, think like “oh I’ll show them, I’ll starve myself.” ??? Idk if it’s cause I think they will feel bad for me? Or I’d be more attractive if I lost more weight, which wouldn’t necessarily be true in terms of other people’s ideal, since I’d be ‘underweight’ if I lose more than 5 lbs. but like I NEED to!"
AnorexiaNervosa,f3b2cn9,t3_dgbtl6,1570799716.0,"Whenever I go multiple days without eating (usually never more than 2) and even if I eat normally, my digestive system YELLS at me for it!  It’s annoying like you should be happy I’m feeding myself not punish me! I no longer fast more than 18 hours bc of this. Stay safe love x"
BingeEatingDisorder,f330mue,t1_f31yju7,1570629640.0,"Ugh. Fuck capitalism, fuck big pharma! It would be essentially free if we had universal healthcare like many other developed countries do. 250,000 Americans die each year due to lack of healthcare for financial reasons. This is why I am voting Bernie 2020. You may not be into politics but I suggest looking into his campaign site. Healthcare is a major issue he is aiming to resolve. If we as a society can tackle this, we can make sure that everyone receives the medical treatment they deserve, REGARDLESS of income! 
Thank you so much doll. I wish you the best and am always here for you <3"
BingeEatingDisorder,f3302yu,t1_f31wlgv,1570629376.0,"I see. I’m not sure how high the doses go, but I would still consider asking for an increase. If you are clinically overweight, you may be able to get medicine specifically for controlling any over eating, but that is up to your physician whether they will do that. 
Although I know saying this doesn’t magically change someone’s perception of themselves but I truly do believe that you can be beautiful no matter what weight you are. It’s hard today to love ourselves... although shout out to the body positive movement. I suggest finding some social media influencers who are advocates for being body positive & accepting yourself! Perhaps checkout some YouTube videos of how others learned to move into a healthier mindset about themselves. For me, binge eating came from self hatred/pity... the more I thought abt my weight, the more likely I was to binge. Resolving deeply rooted issues can make such a difference, and would be facing the problem at the root cause rather than managing the symptoms. 
Here for you anytime!!"
BingeEatingDisorder,f31o51a,t1_f30s70b,1570580384.0,Same. I’m on about 5 different prescriptions just for mental health issues. Perhaps increase the Vyvanse dose ?
BingeEatingDisorder,f30pp5i,t3_deymut,1570559673.0,"YES. It does. It may also come w shaking & sensitivity to caffeine, but that wears off after a week or two. You’ll probably have a bit of insomnia the first few days.

I lost 20lbs within 4 months. What also helps is Vyvanse, it is cleared by the FDA to be prescribed to treat BED. 

Best of luck babe! xoxo"
loseit,f1hw9kd,t3_d9996z,1569501955.0,"I feel this. But sometimes I get comments that aren’t too nice. One distant family member that I hadn’t seen in years was talking to my dad telling him he’s not going to take any cake home because I need to eat some. 
I’m at a perfectly normal weight, I’ve just always been on the bigger side my life so I guess my weight loss is seen as more drastic to family. 
Don’t get me wrong.... it is validating to hear these kinds of comments, and in no way am I complaining about receiving them, but it is definitely something I had never imagined I’d hear. Especially considering my weight. I was 145 and am now 105-110. Keep in mind I’m only 5ft tall !"
AskWomen,f17p9yg,t3_baiiet,1569246365.0,"Yes. But it’s not really a “privilege” as I don’t use it to my advantage or anything. But I do notice it. When I get interviewed for a job by a man, I get hired on the spot. When a woman interviews me I’d get a call back kind of thing. 
In college, I feel confident when I speak up. At the same time, many assume I don’t have such a passion for what I’m studying (anthropology duh) so nobody ever really argues with me when I call them out on something, because I do. I’m huge on human rights etc & often times when someone gets to know me they say “I was intimidated by you at first” which is a surprise to me as I’d consider myself a kind person, but I do understand. 
Even my voice ??! I work a customer service job right now at an office & am on the phones a lot. Men change their entire attitude & tone once they hear my voice.... I’ve even had men tell me “you have a sexy voice” while I’m trying to schedule an appointment for them smh.
Now I’m definitely not a model, but working on my communication skills and body language makes the biggest difference in my opinion. Oh and push up bras. You’d be surprised how big of a difference a push up bra makes on getting some eyes on you!"
