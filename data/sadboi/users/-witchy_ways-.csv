It goes into detail about our specific lineage and the differences. You may have a reiki master from a lineage you don't resonate with. 

21 days after your attunement, reiki will do an energetic cleanse throughout your body. The diet helps the energy flow, but I only stress increasing your water intake during that time. If you take those 21 days to meditate and use reiki, it'll give you a better connection/ understanding of the energy. 

I am a reiki master, I've been a practitioner for 8 years. I am highly intuned to the angelic realm, which doesn't really mean what most people think. I can communicate with angels, I see and hear them. It's not movie magical glowing white wings, they look like everyday normal people to me. It doesn't make me a mind reader, or a psychic. They just show me where a person needs the most healing. That is what I would see in someone else with ""angelic energy"", that you just have a deeper connection to that realm."

Reiki is an intelligent energy, we as masters/practitioners do not control the energy. We are merely a vessel, guiding the healing energy to you.
