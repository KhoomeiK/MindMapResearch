Now if there is life out there, which I think is the most likely scenario, I dont really mind, pain is part of life, death is inevitable, if they come and kill us slowly, which is altogether more and more unlikely wth, what can I do about it?

uruguay,fogigsf,t1_fog7f2c,1587752992.0,"Nose me parece que mucha gente juzga las cosas por razones mas alla que la simple estetica.

Onda los tamboriles son asociados al vulgo, y la gente muchas veces quiere separarse del vulgo por que lo identifica como algo ""bajo"".

Nose si es tu caso.

Los tambores formaron parte de los primero hombres, hay algo muy humano en ello. A mi no me solian gustar, pero dsp me interese por ciertas culturas indigenas, tratando de buscar las raices humanas, y ver que onda como vivian esas personas. En fin, los usaban como ritmos repetitivos, ellos hacian todo en ritmos, caminar, moler granos, la respiracion, el corazon, los dias, las estaciones. Etc. Los ritmos de los tambores aceleran, desaceleran, tienen una conexion directa con la emocion tmb, y la emocion con tema psiicologicos.

Es basico si, no es ningun genero musical barroco, pero en su simpleza esta su magia, es como el principio de la musica, de donde todo surge. Un simple ruido de algo golpiando a otra cosa se transforma en musica simplemente por ser repetido en periodos de cierta frequencia, el ritmo. Es la raiz de toda la historia de la musica.

Y mira qu igual hay tamborileadas que son horrendas como hay otras que son de maestros.

Yo lo veo como un pllato de comida simple pero complejo. Un sushi ponele, o algo simple pero que depende mucho de la calidad de los ingredientes utilizados, y quien lo hizo."
