alone,ey7okle,t3_cqld96,1566892678.0,i can relate to you bro. it’s like i have a lot of friends around me but i still feel so empty... it’s always me that starts a conversation and stuff.. sometimes i do when i receive a notification i get so excited hoping to see its them checking on how i am doing but end up it’s some other random stuff... i’m scared to ask them for favour as i always feel that i’m just a burden.. and i’m also afraid to be more emotionally connected as only then i’ll be more reliant on them and that’s not smth i want.. i feel you man.. ur not alone in this :’)
