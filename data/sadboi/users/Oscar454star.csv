The show treats them like unruly tyrants the crystal gems HATED the diamond authority with a burning passion. You expect me to believe that a 14 year old kid just made a galactic umpire just randomly stop what they’ve been for *EONS* all across the cosmos all because slapped them on the wrist and give them a stern talking to?? Pink diamond never had a say in *anything* they treated her like garbage, ignored her and threw her into a dungeon for thousands of years prior to her fake shattering/death. what makes it so different for Steven all because he’s her son?! If anything the diamonds shouldn’t even care about him let alone listen. But as soon as we see the diamonds in action they’re all pitiful especially blue diamond. White diamond chillingly dissected the crystal gems including the other diamonds and nearly KILLED Steven but as soon she started blushes she’s lovable and redeemed?!? That’s pathetic story telling. So lemme get this straight, the diamonds who made the cluster who wanted to destroy ALL ORGANIC LIFE ON EARTH, decimated and caused mass genocide on planets all over the cosmos for an arbitrary lust of power. Corrupted ALL THE GEMS ON EARTH INCLUDING THEIR OWN SOLDIERS, created gem mutants and shattered anyone who didn’t follow their petty rules isn’t villainous?!?! Are you actually high off your ass? Quit kissing Rebecca’s ass and look at the facts. The diamonds are villains, plain and simple!"

Idk about all that chief. seems like bad writing to me tbh. Blue diamond’s pity party ruined all that build up in the previous seasons since all she did was mourn her death and did *literally nothing* about it.

For example when my ex was mad at me for “not helping with her anxiety” her friend came in saying that she had every right to be upset with you when you ignored her.

AmItheAsshole,fpg17xn,t3_gd9gi6,1588591012.0,To clarify why I (stupidly) decided to back to her was because I thought she had changed as a person and told me about how awful she was to me and wanted to improve as a better partner but she was just the same as before.

Lapis has plenty of experience in this department so why not talk to her about it? She can empathize with Steven’s issues and find a way to fix them for good, it will take time however but it’s better than bottling it up. And again communication is and always will be a *two way street.* Steven’s uncontrollable anger issues and (I hate to say it) stubbornness might make it very difficult for her to talk to him or he might accidentally crack or shatter her."
stevenuniverse,flcfku1,t1_flcelkx,1585029027.0,"*FINALLY!!* Someone said it. I kinda get why Steven is refusing help but at the same time, you can’t be cutting everyone out of your life who wants to help you. Trauma and PTSD are valid reasons as to why someone might accidentally lash out at someone if they relive said traumatic experiences but running away from your problems won’t fix any of it! Steven needs to realize that getting better isn’t gonna happen overnight. It’s a long hard fought journey that could take months or even YEARS to heal from.  I understand why Steven is like this but running away instead of talking to the people who care about him will only make his problems *much worse!* I’m sick and tired of him running away from his problems too."

She helped me get my life back on track when I was struggling with depression (I still do.) but this ultimately caused my relationship to end shorty because of how much I loved her and treated her like a queen. This is a lesson I need to learn, there’s nothing wrong with having someone or your partner giving you compliments every now and then but please don’t do it all the time. It honestly makes you look like a creep and gives off that nice guy mentality. Like a wise man once said “don’t suck her dick.” “You gotta have that balance between push and pull.” And have yourselves a damn good one."
