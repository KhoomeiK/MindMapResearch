Ask yourself how much of your pre-quarantine life you, \*you\* feel you HAVE to go back to.

Well, I meant, when I put on the headset after awhile, I have to hit the window button to turn them on, and then wait a second for them to show up in the headset.  I'd like them to *always* be tracking and showing so I don't have to reach for them blind.  A very, very minor thing.  The controllers don't lose pairing during play. 
I agree about the colors, I will have to pay more attention, and see what's really going on.  I'm sure it's not the headset, as the Reverb had the same ""issue"".  
the headphones are passable for now.  If I regularly watch movies on it and feel like they are really subpar for that, I'll get in-ears.  But as I'd most likely only use them sitting, and can't stand wireless headphones anyway... yeah, I'd just get some with cables, no problem.  But right now, it seems a bit frivolous when I could use the money for more games.
The price is very much not scalping.  You have to consider the Rona situation.  It's all gone to hell.  I'm lucky to have gotten a headset at all for under $400.  The Rift S is $600 right now.  And they go up from there.  people are getting $400 for Rift CV1 and original Vive. 
I can only go by what's available, and this was by far the best buy. 
I get like, what you mean by scalping if it means charging more than they are new, but they are all being overpriced, so at some point it's just supply and demand, I guess.  $280 would have been nice, though I'd have just got the Rift S for $400.
Honestly, I love the small IPD so I think I picked right anyway.  And I have to use the Rift S to be sure, but it doesn't seem like there's a $100 difference(under normal circumstances) let alone a $250 difference(currently)

As far the games, they seem to have a higher ratio of good to bad than my flat-screen games.  And it's so fresh to me it's easy for me to be impressed.  overall I absolutely love the games.
Tried out gorn, and have to wait for some things to change in the next month or 2 because I can't really move around right now. 
It's the only game I really have to physically move by stepping around to really play, at least that I've messed with so far.  Pretty sure that will be the case for boneworks and HL Alyx, but it won't be a problem when i finally get those.

It seems like such an approach to food would for the most part be incredibly healthy.

Huge variations in diet are ideal.  And prevent allergies and many other health problems.

If you're worried about weight gain, maybe avoid the stuff that's hard to track, sauces and condiments and the like.  But if you do that, and you eat all these different foods, and you're still heavy, I can't help but think that you're probably still incredibly healthy."

One thing the U.S. seems to be getting right... you said your partner, if you're LGBTQ+, from what I've seen we are actually treating you guys a lot better than most countries. 
Not worth it if you starve to death, though. 
Everyone talks down on the health insurance, but in practice, the generic meds are pretty cheap and the ER can't turn you down. 
That doesn't mean you should risk moving here, just remember that it's not as bad as it could be.
