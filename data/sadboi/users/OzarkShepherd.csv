Chevy,fqphvrl,t3_gjxxg4,1589546798.0,"I would get a fuel pressure gauge and test the fuel pressure.  Check it while running to see if it gets at least 55 psi.  If not then it might be the fuel pump.  Then turn it off and see if it keeps pressure.  If it loses pressure then it is the regulator or a leaking injector or some other leak.

**Edit** I just noticed the mention of the MAF code.  First check for vacuum leaks, because that can confuse the computer into thinking the MAF sensor is bad.  Then replace the MAF.  I am surprised it runs at all when the MAF is disconnected, because when I have tried disconnecting mine for troubleshooting I had trouble starting.  The MAF tells the computer how much air is being used, and that data is used with data from other sensors to determine the fuel mixture."

Chevy,fm622mc,t1_fm5zlzp,1585784643.0,"I saw the original thread after posting here, and the guy posting about vacuum leaks is probably correct.  

The power brake booster is just a big rubber vacuum diaphragm inside.  If it is leaking vacuum you might hear a hissing noise from it, especially when the brakes are stepped on.  Also, when the brakes are applied, the engine speed may change if the brake booster is leaking.  But the best way is to block the line to the brake booster and see if the engine runs different with that line plugged.  I used to just bend the hose to the booster so it would kink like a garden hose when I was checking for vacuum leaks.

I forgot to mention that the screws holding the top plate of the qjet to the middle sometimes work loose over time, and that can cause vacuum leaks.  You should make sure they are snug.

If you have a th350 3 speed automatic, then check that line for vacuum leaks by blocking it off to check for a change in engine speed.  That transmission had a vacuum diaphragm too.  I don't know about the th400 heavy duty transmission though, if they used vacuum or not."

When new, the stock quadrajet carb was a great compromise between performance and gas mileage.  That was 50 years ago, and the equipment to build new quadrajets was destroyed by Edelbrock about 15 to 20 years ago because it was supposedly worn out.  So unless you pay big money for it to be rebuilt properly with epoxy over weak spots and new bushings at the throttle where 50 years of wear can cause vacuum leaks, you might be better off with an Edelbrock Performer carb."

Debian stable is the opposite philosophy to Arch Linux.  All packages that make it to the stable version have been used in sid and the testing version, and so most bugs have already been found.  Debian stable will not upgrade to newer package versions, but it will get security updates on the packages it came with.  So Debian stable version would be more reliable than nearly anything except perhaps CentOS, as long as you don't add newer versions through backports.

Debian testing version is not quite bleeding edge like Arch, but it does get upgrades to newer packages that have some testing in sid.  This is where packages are tested in preparation for the stable release.  I have testing on a computer, and have had to troubleshoot a crash in the last few months, due to the Nvidia drivers.

Ubuntu LTS is similar in concept to Debian stable but gets occasional kernel and browser upgrades to newer versions.  I had an LTS crash on me years ago due to a kernel update being incompatible with the fglrx driver, and it made me furious because Ubuntu knew from bug reports from regular releases that it would break systems.  However, my son has been running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for almost two years without any software crashes that I remember.  So Ubuntu LTS would be very stable, but not quite as stable as Debian stable.

I would consider Windows 10 to be slightly more stable than Arch or comparable to Debian testing, but not even close to the stability of Debian stable or Ubuntu LTS.  My son's Windows 10 partition has broken two or three times in the last 2 years due to update problems, compared to zero times for his Ubuntu LTS partition in the same time frame.

If Minecraft is the only app open when you are limited to 60 fps, try the system monitor to see if anything is using resources at idle.  CPU should be under 5-10% with nothing else running.

linux4noobs,fguipac,t3_f0cr86,1581121790.0,"I have a Plex/Minecraft/storage server for my house running on Debian 10 with no GUI.  I just access it with ssh.  Specs are 8 GB RAM and a 3.x GHz dual core AMD CPU.  If you use a GUI on the server, that might be inadequate, but without a GUI it is ok for my family.  

Plex only uses a lot of CPU when a lot of new media is found, like right after installation.  Once everything is transcoded, it uses less than 1% of the CPU.  I haven't checked CPU use while someone is streaming though.

Minecraft 1.15 can max out both cores when there are 3-4 players exploring on my server.  I have 6 GB RAM allocated in the startup script.  I know people say Minecraft only uses a single core, but that is not my experience on recent server editions. 

I would recommend installing screen so that you can start Minecraft with it through ssh and still have it running when you close the terminal.  Also I would recommend lm-sensors so you can check the CPU temp during high use.

It isn't that hard.  I took a class in C in college 20 years ago, and barely passed.  That is the extent of my CS training.  About 10 years ago I started with Ubuntu for my desktops, and learned through doing."

linuxquestions,fgjtyt5,t3_eytwp4,1580851347.0,"I tried office 2016 on wine, then on playonlinux, and failed.  I couldn't get past the drm before installing the apps.  However I know 2003 office works on wine, lol.  I like libreoffice better than 2003 office and have self published a couple 300 page books with libreoffice.  While libreoffice can save .doc files, when the .doc is very large or the right fonts aren't installed and used, the .doc might look different when opened with Word.  Codeweavers might get Office 2016 to work but it is a yearly subscription.

You might look into pre-2016 office if you have to share .doc or .docx files with Windows users, because that might work.  Make sure you install the Ms fonts though.  Check the winehq database.  If you don't have to share files with Windows users, then Libreoffice should be adequate."

Stoicism,fg7q7u5,t3_exdy14,1580598723.0,"Adam Smith, who first articulated capitalism, studied Stoicism.  Granted, modern global corporations are not in his Wealth of Nations.  His book paved the way for the impoverished peasants to transition from feudalism to relative wealth under capitalism.  But he worked on a national scale and did not envision corporations importing foreign labor to drive down wages, which is what happens now.  Still his economic policies have raised hundreds of millions out of poverty so that the poor in the US, for example, have luxuries unheard of by the monarchs of the middle ages.  The essentials for a capitalist society, including rule of law and individual freedom, are not against Stoicism.  Now the greed and corruption of the modern global corporations is not in line with Stoicism as I understand it."
