iRacing,eykyoyi,t1_eykyg7b,1567171842.0,Actually just rewatched. You’re a car width wide of the apex in a lot of places.
iRacing,eykyg7b,t3_cxfwcj,1567171658.0,"Comments as above re smoothness, use of track and sighting.

I’ll also add: you seem to be on the understeer limit most of the time and often in too low a gear.

I’d try to get a bit more weight on the front axle on the way in to both get the front to bite and induce a bit more slip at the rear. The whole process should then be smoother, earlier on the gas and faster, with less steering angle (and more feel). Left foot brake to get smooth transitions, and balance the car when it’s on the edge. 

Each time you buzz the limiter is likely to cost you a couple of tenths. Try your 1st gear apexes in 2nd and some of the 2rd in 3th. This will likely increase your minimum apex speed as well as carrying more speed down the straights. 

Lines look pretty good generally. Justgofaster."

MechanicalKeyboardsUK,ey3bco1,t3_cvb7el,1566760119.0,I switch between ISO and ANSI boards. You can set up board layouts in Win10 to switch with a hot key combo which by default is ctrl space. Works well. I need the sterling sign very infrequently and I find the ANSI layout to be more intuitive and better suited to typing.

I like a lot of the content on this sub, but as with anything the hit rate can’t be 100%. That doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy seeing the less successful photographs, because it’s helpful to form one’s own critiques internally and unfiltered on a wide range of images. I don’t think it’s right that the poorer ones shouldn’t get an equal chance to be shown. This isn’t a curated exhibit in a gallery. Yes this photograph _might_ not perfectly fit your, or anyone else’s, criteria for a good example of street photography; but it is a candid photograph taken on the street. I therefore believe it fits, and I stand by OP’s decision to post it.

I wouldn’t have the confidence to post any of my work here. This genre is tough enough without us making it harder for each other."

Rest of the front stage very similar to yours, all under factory grills. Run it all from a JL VXi. Not vintage, but it should work."

You got harness and speakers installed at the factory, and a blanking plate in the dash. Head unit was a dealer fit option. Most of the UK cars I have seen came with a Pioneer (as mine originally did) or a Blaupunkt - I think at least in part because you could get red lighting to match the dash."
vintageaudio,etxinhm,t3_cdznw2,1563300159.0,"Bit of backstory. I am restoring an early '90s BMW. These didn't come with a stereo from the factory so there's some artistic licence allowed when it comes to the choice of unit. I have a modern system of DSP and amplification planned for a hidden install, which should get the FR nice and flat and some of the nastiness of the cabin environment tamed. There's no way I could have had it *look* modern - even the most expensive units nowadays look cheap and nasty and shiny to my eye. This Alpine (the 7385R) was the top-of-the-line (analog) cassette deck for '89 in Europe, and their first to feature RDS. This particular one has had caps and bulbs replaced. And I couldn't resist!
