SuicideWatch,fonttwf,t3_g8dmqx,1587926338.0,"I’m almost 40, nobody will hire me. Nobody thinks I’m trying. And everything I have to contribute is rejected without a second thought. You have much failure to find before your success arrives. As a wise man once said: “If for a while the harder you try, the harder it gets, take heart. So it has been with the best people who ever lived.”

Life sucks and I hate myself. It might never change. But we can adapt to our surrounds and rise to the challenge."

It makes no sense to me, so I can kind of see where you’re coming from. My suggestion is to keep looking for a different therapist. There is to be one who can help you."
SuicideWatch,fmw6ngi,t1_fmw6dsp,1586440683.0,"I have no friends at all. People seem to think I’m an asshole just for existing. Every time I’ve asked for help I was told “you’ve got this”. If they knew me they wouldn’t be saying that. I don’t ask for help unless I have to. Imagine if I was sinking in quicksand and someone came up, but instead of helping they told me “you’ve got this” and walked away. I seem to suffer from “pissed-the-universe-off-itis”."

SuicideWatch,fmukh9c,t1_fmtxceu,1586393180.0,"The street is my only option. But with 4 kids, couple that with nobody seems to care, they try to play this down as though it’s no big deal. Telling me shit like “hang in there”, how the hell is that supposed to help? You don’t know how bad things were before, life keeps getting worse and worse, no improvement of any kind. It’s like I’m stuck in quicksand up to my chin and some walks past and says hang in there, it gets better. And I just keep sinking. I want to be useful, but nobody wants anything I have to offer, not even McDonald’s was willing to hire me, and my anxiety was too high for me to hold down a day job anyway."

SuicideWatch,fldl3uv,t1_fldi9b9,1585066698.0,"Sorry for the confusion, in the novel, Journey to Jershon, the main character deals with it from his adoptive mother. From the sales, I donate to an organization that fights against child abuse. I also believe that charity should not be public, I enjoy just knowing that I made a difference.

  
I appreciate your kindness, that person is a horrible excuse of a person."

“That’s awesome, I’ll have to check it out”
“Hang in there”
“Everyone forgets every now and then” if literally everyone was forgotten as often as I am, then nothing would EVER be accomplished.

While well intended, these are about as comforting as Luna Lovegood saying “you’re just as sane as I am, and sometimes the only recourse I have is to imagine throttling the @$$ that said it."
