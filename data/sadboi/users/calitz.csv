Ingredients

500 grams so flour

15 grams kosher salt

4 grams  instant yeast

325 grams filtered or hard water

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or shallot oil from fried shallots 

4 ounces pitted green olives

Toppings of choice such as red bell pepper, olives, lemons, parsley, and coarse salt.  

Directions

Combine flour, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. Mix with hands or a wooden spoon until no dry flour remains. The bowl should be at least 4 to 6 times the volume of the dough to account for rising.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, making sure that edges are well-sealed, then let rest on the countertop for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Dough should rise dramatically and fill bowl.

Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour, then transfer it to a lightly-floured work surface. Form into a ball by holding it with well-floured hands and tucking the dough underneath itself, rotating it until it forms a tight ball.

Pour half of oil in the bottom of a 12-inch cast iron skillet or large cake pan. Transfer dough to pan, turn to coat in oil, and position seam-side-down. Using a flat palm, press the dough around the skillet, flattening it slightly and spreading oil around the entire bottom and edges of the pan. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough stand at room temperature for 2 hours. After the first hour, adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 550°F.

At the end of the 2 hours, dough should mostly fill the  up to the edge. Use your fingertips to press it around until it fills every corner, popping any large bubbles that appear. Lift up one edge of the dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the dough until there are no air bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the skillet. Spread the chosen toppings all over the surface of the dough and press down on them with your fingertips to embed slightly. Drizzle with remainng oil. Sprinkle with rosemary and coarse salt.

Transfer skillet to oven and bake until top is golden brown and bubbly and bottom is golden brown and crisp when you lift it with a thin spatula, 16 to 24 minutes. Using a thin spatula, loosen focaccia and peek underneath. If bottom is not as crisp as desired, place pan on a burner and cook over medium heat, moving the pan around to cook evenly until it is crisp, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly, slice, and serve. Extra bread should be stored in a brown paper bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 300°F oven for about 10 minutes before serving."

In a pot, preferably a saucier, whisk together thoroughly:


1/3 cup sugar

1/4 cup cornstarch

1/4 teaspoon salt

Slowly add 3 cups of whole or 2% milk while whisking. Apply medium heat and whisk until boiling. Whisk briskly for thirty seconds while it boils rapidly. Do not scrape edges to avoid lumps.  Remove from heat and add:

6 oz bittersweet chocolate

3 tablespoons butter 

2 teaspoons vanilla, brewed espresso, or 1 teaspoon of each

Whisk until melted.  Pour into prepared pie crust. Top with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings. 

For the crust:

Put one stick and 2 tablespoons of frozen butter cut into smallish cubes, 1 and 1/4 cup of AP flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon sugar in food processor. Pulse until small crumbles form. Add three tablespoons of icy water while intermittently pulsing until combined.  Form dough into puck shape and lightly flour the top.  Roll out on lightly floured surface until 10 inches across (pie dough should be thick.)  Carefully place into pie tin and trim any excess.  Blind bake for about 40 minutes at 350F, turning 180 degrees and removing weights and foil halfway through to ensure browned bottom."

Ingredients



4 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes, preferably imported D.O.P. San Marzano tomatoes (see note)

1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing.

4 tablespoons butter

8 cloves garlic, minced (about 3 tablespoons)

1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

1 tablespoon dried oregano

1 medium carrot, cut into large chunks

1 medium onion, split in half

1 large stem fresh basil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional), such as Red Boat

1/2 cup minced fresh parsley or basil leaves (or a mix of the two)



Directions
1.
Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300°F (165°C). Place tomatoes in a large bowl. Using your hands, crush the tomatoes by squeezing them in your fingers until pieces no larger than 1/2-inch remain. Transfer 3 cups of crushed tomatoes to a sealed container and reserve in the refrigerator until step 4.


2.
Heat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a large Dutch oven until butter is melted. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, carrot, onion, and basil, and stir to combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat.


3.
Cover Dutch oven with lid slightly ajar and transfer to oven. Cook, stirring once every 1 to 2 hours, until reduced by about half and darkened to a deep red, 5 to 6 hours (reduce oven temperature if the sauce is bubbling too rapidly or the browned bits begin to turn too dark).


4.
Remove from oven. Using tongs, discard onion halves, carrots, and basil stems. Add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. Add fish sauce, if using. Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in minced herbs along with additional olive oil as desired. Serve immediately, or allow to cool at room temperature, transfer to airtight containers, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Sauce can also be frozen in sealed containers for up to 6 months. To reheat, warm very gently in a saucepan with 1/2 cup water, stirring until it all melts and heats through."

recipes,fm6rm3y,t1_fm6ogq8,1585801303.0,Thanks. I hope you give it a go.
recipes,fm6rl83,t1_fm62ezb,1585801283.0,Thank you
recipes,fm6rk31,t1_fm6qf1g,1585801259.0,Damn. That's the worst. I have three burns on my hand right now and the worst one is from molten apple puree I was cooking the liquid out of for fruit leather 😭
recipes,fm6rf12,t1_fm6qlxh,1585801152.0,"You truly should!  The recipe is very simple and is customizable. Plus, it's relatively low calorie (less than 200 per serving) and quite filling."
recipes,fm6nazc,t1_fm6ke2m,1585798102.0,Oooh good call. Perhaps even dried fig.
recipes,fm6akf8,t1_fm66d9q,1585789826.0,I use buttermilk instead of cream to save calories. The texture is nearly the same.
recipes,fm6ah26,t1_fm66jcr,1585789765.0,I think orange zest and currants would be an amazing add-in.
recipes,fm6abb3,t1_fm66qoo,1585789662.0,I disagree. Jam and cream is great with cheese and ham scones. Like the flavor profile of a Monte Cristo sandwich
recipes,fm69r7m,t1_fm69c8s,1585789313.0,I def read that in a Shirley from Community voice.
recipes,fm64ejy,t1_fm63fz6,1585786040.0,"You are very welcome. They're also baked separate from their circle, more like biscuits, which yields a different texture."
1200isplenty,fm60l62,t1_fm608ls,1585783783.0,Aw shucks ☺️
recipes,fm5wdcm,t1_fm5w6jv,1585781309.0,They sure do!  I didn't include in the recipe but I added fresh nutmeg that really came through in the scent.
recipes,fm5w8br,t3_ft6q12,1585781226.0,"Recipe: 

3/4 cup cold buttermilk

1/4 cup sugar

2 tsp vanilla extract

1 large egg

1 cup all purpose flour

1 cup whole wheat flour (I used a scant cup of whole wheat pastry flour for a lighter crumb)

1 tbsp baking powder

1/2 tsp salt

3 tbsp chilled butter, must be cold cut into small pieces

Scant 1/2 cup each dehydrated apples and pecan bits.

1 egg, lightly beaten

1 1/2 tbsp sugar



INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 375°F.

Combine the first four ingredients in a medium bowl, stirring with a whisk.

Combine flour, baking powder, salt, in a large bowl, stirring with a whisk. Cut in chilled butter with knives or a good processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Gently fold in dehydrated apples and pecans or any add-in of choice such as chocolate chips or currants. Add milk mixture, stirring just until moist.

Place dough onto a floured surface and knead lightly four times with floured hands.

Form dough into an 9-inch circle onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet, about 3/4"" thick.

Using a floured knife, cut dough into 12 wedges all the way through.

Brush egg wash over dough and sprinkle evenly with sugar.

Bake until golden, about 18-20 minutes, depending on your oven. Serve warm."
