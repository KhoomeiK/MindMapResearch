Its pretty much the same as yours and I say everything looks great. I'd only suggest another storage option. Either a nice ssd or a hdd drive. Nice choice going with the m2 ssd and make sure you put your os on the m2 as this will increase the speed your pc boots up at and while 1tb is a good amount of storage, everyone has told me to get another storage option.

The price vs performance on 2x8gb ram and 2x16gb is minimal, takes more power and is only needed if you plan on video editing. If gaming is the sole reason of this build then stick with the 2x8gb ram as you will save money and work just as well.

Hope this helped a bit."

I have been recommended AMD over Intel by people on this subreddit and good friends of mine. They all say later cards surpass  some of the newer Intel cards. I bought a ryzen 7 3800x 8 core cpu for $339.99 on Amazon and have high hopes for it.

I bought a 2070 super and my experienced pc friend expects this thing to run like dream on 1440p 60+fps and my overall build came to about $1,700+ and with your budget, that might be a good CPU to consider.

Just make sure you get a good motherboard to pair it with. I barely got mine (MSI B420 tomahawk max) before it sold out, but it is hard (for me at least) to find a good motherboard to pair it with without going above $140-$200.

My favorite part would have to be the soundtrack and the sound design in general.

""This might be the mother, but more often in storks, it is the father that rids the nest of weak chicks when the mother fails to return from a feeding trip and the father's burden increases.

EDIT: As enough of you have found this interesting, I should also note, young birds of most species are fairly resilient to fall damage. This looks like a nest built on a house over land. Meaning, the chick will have likely survived and if not found quickly will become a meal for a housecat. Typically, however, these nests are over water and riparian environments wherein the dropped chick drowns quickly. In urban areas, it's not unusual for local cats and people alike to keep an eye on stork nests for both easy-meal and rescue purposes. This stork here didn't really wound the chick. In some cases, the chicks will be pecked nearly to death before being dropped over solid ground."""

A thing to note is to try and start small. What I mean by this is that you don't want to go to an event with a lot of people or else it could be a bit overwhelming and could cause the experience to reinforce your social anxiety. 

Be upfront with the people you meet up with. Mention that you are new and want to get involved and I'm sure someone there will be willing to help you. Everyone there was someone new at some point.

Do not overreach. What I mean is that you should only go to events or clubs that you know will be interesting and you know you will participate when you go. 

An example would be if you saw somewhere that there is a group of people looking for others to join their Band Club. If you are not interested in anything band related then it will not only be a bad experience for yourself but for everyone else there. It is fine to branch out but I tell myself this: ""If you are going to go, you have to participate and have at least 3 conversations with 3 different people.""

Yeet

Yeet is a beautiful and commnly misused word. It is very flexible and can take many parts of speech.

However, it's tenses are often used incorrectly. In the future, you ""will yeet,"" In the present you ""are yeeting,"" and in the past, ""you yote.""

""Yote"" is often replaced with ""yeeted,"" but that is a prime example of poor grammar. Using ""yeeted"" instead of ""yote"" would be like saying ""eated"" instead of ""ate."" It makes you sound like a baby or a moron.

""Yeet"" as a verb

1. to make a violent motion of any variety, such as a ""whip,"" or any motion that may be associated with violent camera shake or photo blur.

2. ""Yeet"" is quite commonly used as a verb for the specific purpose of throwing an object forcefully over a long distance.

3. ""Yeet"" can also be used as something you'd include in a sentence to describe what happened to someone who has been greatly or suddenly defeated in a competition such as sports or a video game.

""Yeet"" as a pro-sentence

1. In this case, ""yeet"" takes the role of ""yes."" You'd say ""yeet"" instead of ""yes"" or ""yeah"" if you want people to know you're fun and hip.

""Yeet"" as an exclamation

1. This form of ""yeet"" can be exclaimed in any situation where the verb form could be used to describe the action in which the speaker is currently partaking. For instance, if you throw something violently or hit a nasty whip, you may exclaim ""Yeet!"" while doing so.

When Johnny entered the whipping competition, you better believe he hit 'em with that yeet.

Dan yote the basketball from half court.

Damn, those guys really got yote at the end of last night's game.

A. Yeet.
