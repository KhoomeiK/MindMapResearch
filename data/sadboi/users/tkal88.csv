However, I think  there’s a few factors to this as many people feel the same way. Technology as a whole has played a major role in these social areas of life. Also, the older you get, people begin getting married, kids, relationships, etc. Technology is a blessing and a curse. We are more connected than ever before in human history via the internet but that same connectedness also comes with a social price and that seems to be people are isolating more than ever. You’re certainly not alone. IMO, it’s the unpredictably of people, over analyzing, and people more than ever don’t want to leave their “comfort zone.”"

I'm older and more wise living with this forever and our thought patterns, negative thinking, low self- esteem, general sadness, plus so many others are the reason we automatically divert to our depressed thinking selves. I've learned to live with it and embrace it. I've caused so many awkward encounters with random people or even family because my anxiety gets so revved up, its painfully obvious, so I straight ghost. Even my high school friends that are still around bring shit like this up all the time and we just laugh, called me the Houdini, one second I'm there, next, I'm out. All due to depression/anxiety. I simply do not care what other people think of my mental health or whatever judgements people place on me. I have bad days, almost everyday, trying to isolate, find a way to not work, etc. I've realized that simply showing up to work, making money, keeping busy makes days go by faster even if the mind is fuckin you up. As you get older, you will learn to either live with it and cope through therapy, meds, healthy lifestyle, etc. Or you can choose to dwell on the fact that you have major depressive disorder, panic disorders (what I have). I've seen this go either way, chose to be yourself and learn about coping techniques, therapy, anything OR the other road is blaming everything on your depression and end up unhappy, over-medicated, pretty lonely, and most likely unemployed (Another reason why making money, jobs, keeping busy is important,)"

depression,f5q463r,t3_dop467,1572372281.0,"I do quite a bit of isolation but I also enjoy it. It took me a very long time to finally become comfortable with myself. I used to use a shit load of drugs in my 20’s and I realized that it was the drugs that brought “friends” together. I have been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, all the fun shit. I’m 31 now, have a wife and as you get older you realize the importance of surrounding yourself with positive people. It seems that every time I try to make new friends they always offer me coke or some other drug which is fine, I simply decline and they never talk to me again. I do have a core group of friends that live about 50 miles away so we don’t get to see each other too often but it is what it is. I also have two dogs which helps so much, going on hikes and all that. For whatever reason I can’t seem to find positive people that don’t do drugs, sounds weird but it’s true. So my wife and I hang out a ton, have baby on the way, and life is so much better this way compared to being 6 feet under like so many people I know. I understand isolation can be difficult at first, but it all depends on your personal circumstances. Just my two cents.

I remember having many abscesses that would be so swollen and hot to the touch, it was horrible but I kept getting high and trying to forget about it. 

I’ve been clean for 7 years now. And to this very day, many of my veins are very fucked up and it’s because of re-using needles. I can’t even see my veins anymore and it’s been a long time since I’ve even touched a needle. You’re still young but for your own sake, do whatever you can to stop reusing needles. As far as the IV ritual goes, once you make up your mind to try to stay clean, it will take time to get over it. Sometimes I still fantasize about it but I know that if I was to use H again, it is suicide, simple as that."
