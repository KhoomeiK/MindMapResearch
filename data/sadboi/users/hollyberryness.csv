 Opinions can change, and can be falsely or truthfully based in fact, but the facts themselves never change. It's a Mexican hat dance, the dancers are the opinions always moving and changing, the hat is the fact(s) remaining steadfast. Opinions are formed as facts are accepted and/or rejected, to such varying degrees that opinions are very dynamic and personal between groups of people for the most part but also between individuals themselves.

Lol obviously, PLEASE PEOPLE, the Mexican hat dance is a loose and silly analogy, and everything I'm trying to say isn't an attack on anyone, but still, I'm trying so dearly to communicate that opinions are their own thing, based in fact sometimes but often based on shit that doesn't make a lick of sense to those with a differing opinion,whether or not those differing opinions are based on fact or fiction. There's never a right or wrong when it comes to opinion; there is a tremendous amount of right and wrong when it comes to fact, but that's a debate most philosophers would annihilate from every angle.

People spout opinion as fact all the time, unfortunately (?) it's on the receiver to either accept that opinion as fact or else continue holding onto their own opinions, or else move onto another opinion. The facts remain steadfast, the opinions can change. There's the difference.

I agree opinions should be informed but the reality is they are more likely NOT informed. Or better yet, they are malinformed.

And subsequently we have no coping skills, so handling this external pandemic in addition to the internal mental pandemic is nearly impossible.

Mindfulness,fqemoek,t3_gie5e0,1589310093.0,"I've found it's a nice grounding, centering practice to just pause before/after I enter/leave a place.

I may just sit on my living room floor (grounding) sipping some tea before I leave for work, not thinking about work but just thinking about my tea, my body, my current state in general. Or just looking out the window thinking of nothing!

When I leave the house I will always pause to feel the cool air, look at the sky, listen to the birds. In that moment I'm no longer in my home, but I'm still not at work. 

In the car I am thoroughly engrossed in my music, podcast, etc. But most importantly my mindfulness is on driving safely and being aware of my surroundings, so as not to be on autopilot when I'm operating a potential death machine.

I typically arrive first to work before anyone, even if it's 5 minutes, just so I can again acclamate to this new environment and the new ""role"" I'll be fulfilling for the day. I use the time to prepare my space, my head, my coffee/tea, my body. And to deconstruct the day ahead. Making lists helps! Prioritize only one it two tasks for the day, and if you get your main priorties done, you can leave work a little clear headed. Whatever extra time can be spent working on less important things, helping alleviate your workload, but if you can't get to the less important things it's not going to haunt you later. 

Before going home, write down a tentative list of things you want/need to tackle first thing the next work day. Maybe even a few notes on what your thoughts are, what needs done, etc. That way you are leaving with some closure. But dont push this! You're mentally thrashed after a full day work, your best thinking comes in the morning when your fresh. You can edit your list next work day when you're clear-headed again, but at least you have a clear starting and ending point each day.

Of course, on your way home do the same centering techniques in reverse. Giving yourself time and space to transition before you ever get home.

And I'll end with this: trust your natural processes! We sort so much information when we sleep. If you have stress from unfinished work or a problem you can't sort, you can *look forward* to sleep as an extremely helpful tool! Can't tell you how many times I've been frustrated over a work problem, only to wake up with the answer. Go to sleep with intention and trust that it will be restorative and helpful in every way."

It's been hard for me to accept that I likely learned to be highly empathetic *because* I was neglected and abused. It's a truth I'm often unable to swallow. I think those of us with C-PTSD have that in common: we had to develop this defense mechanism that allows us to acutely tune in to people and environment, and I think this defense mechanism also served as an attempt to somehow gain the love we lacked - ""mom seems mad, better try to cheer her up..."" ""Dad is acting strange, how can I make things better?"".... Constantly trying to guess and fix, predict and adjust.  Shoot, everytime I walk in a room to this day, I am instantly and unconsciously feeling the vibe of the room and the people, assessing it for danger (there's always danger! Haha), figuring out who is safe who isn't... 

It may sound counterintuitive but I think people raised in a constantly loving, secure environment just don't have that depth of empathy to see your true pain, or sometimes your true self. I think it's even more difficult for them to *sense* those intricately hidden, delicate feelings we are so good at keeping close for our safety.  Note: I'm not saying those from a nurturing upbringing don't have empathy at all, just pointing out  that it may not be developed in such a robust and dire way.

 Trust me, I have innumerable journal entries lamenting about just what you bring up in this post! It's uncanny. I wish I had some more relief to offer, but really this is all I got and it ain't much, sad lol."

Coronavirus,fqbz9wm,t1_fqaj6xr,1589246893.0,"I've read a few memoirs and my schools were very good about educating us to their history -- I do not like comparing tragedies, but it's a tragedy in itself this isn't as well known as the Holocaust or slavery in America.

Basically we wanted their land, and the resources their land provided (animals/hides, precious metals, land to expand, etc). We wanted to own all of America, at any cost. Most tribes were trying to be peaceful, and we took advantage of that, making false treaties to move a tribe to less desirable land so we could then take their home and rape it for whatever we wanted, of course we rarely held up our end of the bargain. If the tribe tried to defend themselves or their homes, we would slaughter them until they complied.  These forced migrations and constant broken treaties also caused tensions and wars between tribes themselves.

Obviously there is so much more than this but that's their history in a nutshell. And now they are in their little ""protected territories"" the government keeps ignoring them and their needs for assistance in getting basic human necessities, as such the conditions are often slumlike with rampant addiction, alcoholism, crime, suicide, depression, lack of education or opportunity... Sigh. It breaks my heart.

I do want to say, not every native American lives in squalor now. So many have been able to hold onto their culture and livelihood and pride and humility and that is beautiful. I hope conditions improve for native peoples. Gross, I just realized how much Americans dislike immigrants yet we can't even honor the original people who welcomed us when we ""immigrated""... Now I'm getting frustrated lol"
