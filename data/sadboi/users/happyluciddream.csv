That said, DID develops through trauma and the alters are formed by the brain to protect the body from harm or the memories of it. Could it be that this alter is a protector in some way or holds trauma that makes him wary of you? 

I would try to talk to your boyfriend if I were you, it seems from your text that he is able to communicate with his alters in some way, so maybe he can give you some insight as to what is going on. Being honest about it would probably be the best thing to do. You are the partner of your boyfriend, but this also means all the alters interact with you.
