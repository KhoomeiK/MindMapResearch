nus,fr55rfq,t3_gmkl0z,1589902990.0,"did you read the details of the offer in the link provided? At the top it should say “Please note that you are allowed to concurrently hold all the schemes offered to you below. As such, you can accept one or more schemes, if applicable”. The schemes shown have ALREADY been OFFERED to you. Hence, they give you the option to pick and choose which and how many you would like to ACCEPT. At the bottom of the page there are buttons to accept and refuse the offer(s) selected. Is this still confusing to you? which part of the letter gives you the impression that you would have to re-apply?

As for the financial aid calculator, I’m not sure how it works either but it’s highly highly unlikely that the school would waive your tuition fees. I would recommend ignoring that section."
SGExams,fpq4wq4,t3_ged7sg,1588815235.0,I was from sa and it is compulsory to take h2 math if you want to take h2 physics. You won’t be required to take h2 math for other science subjects. But tbh if your results allow it then you should really go for vjc instead

Not to mention the plot giving just the right amount of screen time to all the side characters while still maintaining focus of the main character and not derailing. It’s not everyday you see the fine details of a show so carefully crafted."

In fact, women shaving their body hair only became a custom during ww2. It’s definitely not as “”necessary” as society makes it out to be."

SGExams,foqpb26,t3_g90ip3,1587998324.0,"I took h2 physics and scored straight Us throughout the 2 years with slight improvement towards the end. For A levels I got a distinction. IMO if you’re able to score A/B for school exams you’re very good alr
I think all the advice I could give you is to memorize all the definitions, laws and formulas since definition qns carry a lot of marks in A levels. Make sure you have your basic concepts down before you chiong hard questions. Most importantly, don’t be careless."

I also thought I might be developing tourette’s but I think it’s just a lot of repressed anxiety. I thought it was something only I experienced lol

SGExams,foml7rx,t3_g7q0hq,1587894227.0,"To me, making notes will be most useful to people with a bad memory. For example, writing down physics formulas on notecards and referring to them while studying or right before entering the exam hall is less of a hassle compared to flipping through the mountain of lecture notes just to find that one line. If you can remember all your content without making notes thus far then you’re steady, no need for notes."

When I get intrusive thoughts, they’re usually a memory of an embarrassing or awkward moment and I’d jerk and blurt out a cuss like I’m telling my brain to shut up haha. I’ve read that a way to deal with these intrusive thoughts is to let them pass instead of trying to resist them(hence, the physical reaction). I’ve been trying to do that but it’s easier said than done :/ I’ve never read about another person experiencing this type of intrusive thought so thanks OP for voicing it out. I feel a lot less weird now"
