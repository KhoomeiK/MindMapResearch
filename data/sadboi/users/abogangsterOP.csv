En Costco y Sams la experiencia ha sido un poco mÃ¡s tranquila, aunque desconozco si alguien haya tenido igual malas experiencias ahi."

mexicans,ezsu4ac,t3_chg9lv,1568109787.0,"What's up pal?, i am curious about this, because i share your hate to robbers, probably my hate is not as much succesful as yours, because i never had the chance to kill a rat in self-defense before, it has to be a pretty much fucked up sensation, i'm glad you're okay, but i want to ask to someone like you about this:

1. did you hate the rat for being mexican or for being a robber?
2. you said ""alien"" but what if he was legal? or it doesn't matter?
3. How do you know it was mexican? what if he was from any other latino country? like PerÃº? or Chile? maybe Guatemala? 
4. I'm saying this 'cause i have good mexican friends and they are good people, students like me, most of them, and they think America is a wonderful place, and they respect the country, despite this kind of expressions of hate towards them, but of course i understand your point of view, like i said before: i hate rats as much you do, but, i hate them for being rats, i never think where they came from.

sorry for my broken english, it's a work in progress."
