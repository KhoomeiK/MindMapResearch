OWConsole,fkc6zgz,t1_fkamq7d,1584047018.0,r/mercymains is a good subreddit if you really want to get good with her
OWConsole,fkc6lf6,t3_fhf0fs,1584046795.0,"Here's some things I've learned after playing mercy for 2 years.

1. Damage boost when no one needs healing (sometimes use it even when they do) and use it especially to help your team push through a choke

2. Mercy's guardian angel ability is extremely useful for maneuvering around your team (you can do a higher jump if you use guardian angle and jump at the same time you will fly higher, not a super jump but still good)

3. Don't be afraid to be agressive with her, her gun does a surprising amount of damage, if you see an enemy at low health go ahead and pick them off as long as you prioritize healing

4. Rez is a powerful ability and everyone knows it so be careful where you rez check to make sure your surroundings are clear first or if your team is protecting you for the rez, don't take any unnecessary risk with it since you are completely exposed mid rez.

5. Valkyrie is great for pushing if you use damage boost try to mix between healing and damage with ults both will help the team immensely. Use the flying to your advantage don't always go high but move around a bunch it makes you harder to hit

6. If possible try to stick close with a tank and don't be afraid to use them as a meat shield you can heal them and that's the tanks job. You will have an easier time living if you are closer to your tanks (as long as they are near the point)

7. Know when to let people die, don't risk your life for people that overextend that will just get you killed. If they are too far away tell them to group up and hold your ground they eventually will have to come back to you for healing. 

8. Move and don't stop moving, mercy is small so she is already hard to hit but if you keep strafing and crouching you are harder to hit.

9. Be aware of escape routes and objects you can use for cover, the payload acts as a great shield if you use it right. Rezing while you are behind something is a great way to stay alive.

10. Know when to retreat, if your team is getting overwhelmed and you feel you need to regroup don't be afraid to retreat for a bit your are more useful alive. Guardian angle is a great means of escape if a teammate is nearby to get you out of danger."
