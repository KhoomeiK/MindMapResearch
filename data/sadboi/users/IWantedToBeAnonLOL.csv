BPD,fr5amtw,t3_gmmrtz,1589905390.0,"Romantic - Go yeah - they never last more than a year.

Friendship - Yes, I always manage to do (or they label) me as doing something wrong or I‚Äôm the one that broke it. 

I think my impulsiveness and ability to act brash and hot headedness is an issue for me and others. I also had incredibly bad coping mechanisms and the horrible need to have a reply instantly and checking when they were last online and shit. Made it so difficult. 

But work relationships aren‚Äôt the worst. People can see I work my arse off and I get on with them sometimes. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit radical and too truthfully honest but I‚Äôm trying to change it. 

I think I have a very chaotic life and it doesn‚Äôt suit some people. There‚Äôs a lot of trauma (maybe idk i think others consider it trauma) and that doesn‚Äôt suit the people I used to know and date. 

I‚Äôm taking time to myself after a pretty traumatic event this year and it‚Äôs been good so far."
