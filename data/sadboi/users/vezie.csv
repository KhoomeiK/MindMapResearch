morbidquestions,fr0u876,t1_fr0f5ly,1589806854.0,Yes but what they are saying I think is maybe it is just OCD that is creating the intrusive thoughts and making OP believe they’re a pedophile.
morbidquestions,fr0u2xy,t1_fr0f7ct,1589806755.0,"I was thinking the same thing and I’m wondering if it’s an actual attraction or severe intrusive thoughts making OP think it’s attraction. Intrusive thoughts are common and in some people they can be extremely distressing and u feel like a monster for even thinking these things but the thing is that you can’t control it. The thoughts just come and the more u fight them and shove them down the more they come back. I would acknowledge the thought, know it’s there, then let it pass. Telling yourself it’s just a thought that’s trying to trick me. I’m a good person and I would never do those things. 
I would also try to establish if this is a real sexual attraction or intrusive thoughts. Pedophiles are sexually attracted to children as other people are to their significant others. Like when I see a hot dude on the street I check him out. Pedophiles will feel the urge to check children out in this way. 
Understanding your thoughts and feelings is the first step to recovery."

They’re not out there declaring the woman insane, they’re just stating their opinion (which happens to be professional in nature).

The kids can’t leave and no visitors are coming and the kids aren’t going to school where they can get a break from the abuse or potentially alert their teachers. Get the evidence and report it right away. There’s no penalty for reporting suspected child abuse. Sitting there with a journal recording every instance is just waiting for something to happen to the kid in the meantime. I’ve worked in group home for foster kids with behavioral issues.

Lately my anxiety seems to be based less around thoughts and ideas (although thoughts are usually the cause of anxiety, so I’m probably experiencing them on a subconscious level). My impending doom feeling is literally a physical feeling. Like my fight or flight gets activated for no reason and I feel like I’m in danger. I have had a couple panic attacks in the past so I do not think they’re panic attacks. They’re more like an anxiety attack that I don’t know the cause of or how to fix it.

When I was in elementary school my mom got an overnight job at a pharmacy so she was always just getting to sleep by the time we were waking up for school. My sister and I both had long hair and my dad had no idea how to style it at all. He took a course at the local hairdressing school in which I had to go along as the practice dummy. I hated it because when he was still learning, his brushing and attempted ponytailing hurt like hell but once he got better I didn’t mind going. The course only lasted a couple weeks but since then my dad could always do the best braids and hairstyles—way better than my mom. When she got a normal 9-5 job we still asked our dad to do our hair cause he did it better. Good job being a dedicated father! Props to you!!

My depression has always been the most debilitating. The time lapse really motivated me to keep going. Usually when I try to clean my room I end up stopping or taking a break and never finishing. But with the time lapse I just wanted to keep going for the sake of the video. My room is trashed again because depression is a beast I’m still trying to figure out so maybe I’ll make another video.
