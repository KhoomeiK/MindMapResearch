SuicideWatch,fgig0b7,t1_fgibxqe,1580820443.0,"To be honest I genuinely thought that me interviewing for this job was more of a formality. When I didn't get it I was, ""fuuuuuuuccccccckkkkkkk"" ; it's probably a blessing in disguise though since I've not exactly enjoyed the job for the last year or so. I used to enjoy the challenge of it but it's ground me down over the years. I'm an engineer, I left the navy for this job and all I do is sit at a desk designing electrical circuits; it's pretty soul destroying. So I've been thinking about getting back to sea doing something more hands on. The only issue is that I don't feel I have enough experience to do so. I'll still pursue it but there's some courses that I'll have to do to even be considered, if considered at all. All I know is that this current job can go fuck themselves; which is essentially what I said to my boss yesterday!

I can get my CV looking good, I'll have to cater it to the future employer but I can easily do that. Luckily I am pretty good at selling myself, well I used to be at least. Yes, I'll almost definitely take a knock in pay but a change of scenery sounds amazing to me right now. Who knows maybe it'll be something I'm passionate about and that I can enjoy it to the full. 

It kinda went smoothly, I don't think she expected the letter at all to be fair. I care about her a lot and I know she cares about me too which is why it's currently very difficult to not be able to talk to her or anything. Everyone I've talked to about her has basically said the same thing though, including you. It's just hard to take and swallow the truth. I'm still wearing the acorn pin I bought hoping to give to her but it's for me now. Someone over the holidays told me to keep it because she doesn't deserve it and probably never will. So I'm wearing it in some kind of emotional stance, weird right?

Thank you for all your kind words, I really needed it today."

SuicideWatch,fgialfv,t1_fgi9h6r,1580814243.0,"Thank you for your reply, I appreciate your concern. 

That whole thing with the girl is part of me feeling this way and I'd be a fool to say otherwise; I have broken things off with her for now. Not that there was anything serious happening anyway. We hung out a lot and I was struggling with my feelings towards her so I wrote her a letter basically explaining that I needed a break from her. It's been about a week now and it's been difficult for sure; I just couldn't deal with the limbo any longer. She was visibly upset having read the letter and I felt bad. I don't want to lose her fully, I guess I just hope that maybe I'll be able to have some kind of friendship with her in the future. The fact that she works where I am makes things a tad awkward...I will heed your advice from now on even though I have been stung with the whole ""don't shit where you eat"" shit before, in the same office I am currently in. 

My other issues are that I feel a sense of being trapped in my current lifestyle. I got told yesterday that I didn't get the promotion I applied for and I think I'm done in this line of work I'm in. I had an interview feedback meeting yesterday and they told me I didn't get the job. So I told them that I won't be applying again and that I'll be looking elsewhere; more than likely a different industry too. They told me that they really don't want me to leave but I just shrugged my shoulders back; mostly because at that point I could feel an anxiety attack happening internally and if I had said anything I'd have shown too much emotion.

I have an overwhelming need to escape and run away but I don't feel like I can right now. I had an awful year last year which featured consistent bad news resulting me ending up in a mental ward for a couple of weeks. I was hoping that this year would be different but it seems as though this year is going to be no different.

Do you ever get that feeling that you know things need to change but you can't figure out what direction you need to go? I have that constantly. I feel fully lost and it's bringing me down massively!"
