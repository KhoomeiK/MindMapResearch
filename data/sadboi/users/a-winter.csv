antinatalism,fhnr2sk,t1_fhlge8w,1581731147.0,Can't agree more. My mentor usually says that. Although he's a decent person and he just want to help me pick a right path but I can't stand that shit. I don't dream of labor
bioinformatics,fhnp7w9,t1_fhkz6bw,1581730263.0,Thanks for your reply. I'm always worried that an MD only can't satisfy the admission requirements. My only solution for tuition fee is scholarship. Will having a second degree make any differences?

bioinformatics,fhks2k3,t1_fhki607,1581690208.0,it seems vague to me tbh. I'm thinking about genetics. My mentor suggests me looking into statistical geneticist and some applications of machine learning in medicines. I think my biggest problem is that I don't know what I really want.
