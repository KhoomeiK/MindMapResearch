femalefashionadvice,ewmfeim,t3_cojgx5,1565550327.0,"The people who look so effortlessly put together have put a lot of effort in it. :D With that being said, I might have a few tips, maybe they've been said already, but that's what I do.
1. Choose your metal. By that I mean looking at your jewellery, hair accessories and clothes and choosing items with the same colour of metal. For example I am a silver girl, so I try to avoid buying things with golden details, those items just look out of place with my silver vibe.
2. Choose everyday jewellery. 1 or 2 necklaces, 1 long pair of earring, 1 short, a bracelet and a watch or something. Just your go-to. imo jewellery makes such a difference with your look and if you have your go-to set, you don't have to think about it very much. Once you have your outfit on, you look at the neckline, if it needs a necklace, you add it, maybe it needs 2. If you have your hair up, longer earrings can shine, if your hair is down, I'd recommend studs. But just having those 3-6 go to items to pick from makes it easy to grab your jewellery in the morning and get out the door. Make sure it's the same colour of metal tho.
3. Pick a day and do a fashion show for yourself. Try on different outfits, take pictures of what you like. If you have items in your closet that you don't wear but would want to, try them on with a lot of things and if you like it with something, again, take a pic. If you have items that don't go with anything, you can either remove them from your wardrobe or think, what items would you need to style that piece of clothing and put it in your shopping list for the next time you're going shopping. So now you have your pictures of your outfits. Make a folder of them in your gallery and then in the mornings you can flip through the album and pick one!
4. Have a lint roller in your bedroom, hallway, bag. 
5. Keep your shoes clean. Makes such a difference. Usually toothpaste does the trick on smooth textures. 
6. Make your hair easy to maintain. When I colour my hair, I make like ombre or something but I don't colour my roots because I cannot be bothered to colour them every month. If they grow out, it still looks good. Try to style your hair out of the shower so you don't have to do it in the morning. I have wavy-straight hair so I either put it up in a bun to bring out the curls or braid it to make it curlier. If i forget to do it, I just pull the top layer of my hair back since it fits my face. Try out some easy hairstyles and find something that fits your face. Of course I know nothing about styling super textured hair so someone else should talk about that.
7. Skin. Care. I really try to keep my face okay, so that I wouldn't have to spend an hour doing make up every morning. Figure out what are your best facial features. For example. I have dark hair everywhere so my brows are super thick and my lashes as well. But it means I have to shave sometimes. So I spend more time on my skin and lips, since my brows and lashes are already ""there"" and if I have no time to do them, it's okay. I actually only try to use tinted moisturizer, bronzer, mascara and lip balm, but during my bloody hell I know I have to take some more time to feel comfortable. And only wear make up as long as you need it. It really is a burden to your skin so take it of as soon as you can and try to go make up free as often as you can.
Hope it helps! :)"

So now I am trying to embrace the positive sides of it and not focus on the negative. Although if I feel negative emotions from someone, it's good because I can talk to them before they have even mentioned anything. Sometimes people let their anger out on someone if they don't address it, so I think I've avoided many conflicts by having heart-to-hearts with people before they can jump on my throat because they are angry or sad about something else. Often people are surprised if I talk to them about it because they didn't even know they were showing these emotions."

Being an open book takes a lot of work and trust, you have to trust that the other person loves you no matter what. That's the beauty of it tho. Total level of comfort. As if u were alone. I really don't need time away from him but I know I can take that time if I want.

I trust my partner and he trusts me, and we do tell each other everything, that's why we don't fight anymore. Like at all. We just feel bad if we made the other one feel bad or idk but we resolve this by talking, openly. At first when we needed our ""privacy"" we had lots of fights.

Locating through social media might be useful if I am out for the evening and they cannot reach my phone but we decided he picks me up at 2am for example, then they can see maybe from my convos with friends where we might be atm.

unpopularopinion,euwqk0q,t1_euwpk4f,1564078363.0,"Well I think secrecy in relationships is quite obviously bad. But I use the word privacy because:

2) I need privacy with my friends, they don't need to know every detail of my life 
3) I don't need privacy with my partner because I don't need to keep anything private from him. 

And yeah, once you find that kinda person for yourself, everything becomes easier. I hope you find someone you can openly communicate with and be happy with. Takes a lot of work to get to that point but it is possible!"
unpopularopinion,euwpl8a,t1_euwob4h,1564078033.0,"Yeah, I agree that everyone needs time alone, but that can be communicated as well. Just disappearing because ""you need privacy"" is not acceptable.

We don't track each other's every move, but just knowing this stuff about your partner is necessary for even safety purposes and if u openly communicate your thoughts and needs, everyone stays happy.
And I really don't control my partner, nor does he control me, we just have access to everything in case we need it and it does happen. Not because I think he is hiding something from me, but for the most practical things in life."

enfj,eu5o5ho,t3_cevbea,1563481684.0,"I had a difficult childhood as well. Not in the sense of food and shelter but with being understood. I was always the sunshine kid, the youngest in my family and the only girl. 
My family is very conservative and judging and I am very liberal and love people, all people. We live in a post Soviet Union country so discrimination is common here. I did not understand why we have to hate some people or when we were walking down the street, why my mom told that someone is ugly or dresses weird. My love of people also makes me seem naive but I really don't think I am. I just love people until they prove me they can't be trusted. But I don't go around hugging stangers and jumping in random people's car. So I felt very trapped in my home. At one point my dad told me ""why you gotta smile and be so overly nice with cashiers? this is not America!"" and I was shocked. They also yelled at me if I cried, they basically told me not to show emotion. So I began to cry at night when they couldn't hear or see me, I was only affectionate with my friends. 
I also had hard time with friends. I've always wanted the one and only bff, a friendship like in the movies. I never had that. I always had lots of friends but never the one. And my friends were mad at me when I couldn't pick, who was my better friend. I was the class supervisor (I don't know if you have that in other countries as well? one student who collect the money for trips, communicated problems between students and teachers and so on) and got along with everyone. Then a bunch of people ganged up on me and I didn't even know why so I switched schools because I didn't feel like dealing with the drama. In the other school girls started to hate on me because I got along with the boys (in middle school boys and schools were separate and made fun of eachother) but my parents didn't let me switch schools again just because I wanted to. 
So yeah, I moved out as soon as possible and now live with my bff, my sweetheart, my ride or die. I can tell him every day I love him and and I can hug and kiss him and I just love it so much (he is an infp). Been together for 4 years and I visit home as rarely as possible. Home made me a campaigner (enfp) and this was the worse version of me since it wasn't truly me. I love enfp-s but just you know, you can't be someone you are not. I was very erratic and did not have my shit together, I also got depression and anxiety (anxiety mostly because my parents didn't let me show emotions). Now I am healing and in a really good place.

WeightLossAdvice,etj37g3,t3_cbx3y6,1562865305.0,"I've been dealing with depression for 3 years now and it took the absolute rock bottom to start getting better. So first of all I want to say I hope your pain eases and you get better, if not well! 
Here's what helped me on my journey:
1. Think what depression is taking away from you, then you realize what you really want, why you really want to get better.
2. Talk to your psychiatrist about medication, there are some medication that help you lose weight, some make you gain weight. If you explain your doctor why weight is making your depression worse, they should prescribe you different medication.
3. Notice little improvements. I remember showering first time in a week and I was really proud of myself. Don't think about things you should've done today, think about things you did and be proud. It can be hard to lose weight when you pressure yourself and feel bad when you did not work out or ate junk. You are giving your best every day and with depression, some days your best is just getting out of bed. So don't beat yourself up and take one thing at a time.
4. When you feel like eating junk, look at the calories and quantities and track it, then you can still eat that junk but in smaller quantities and still be on track with your weight loss goals. I eat ice cream everyday, but since it is like 240kcal, i eat a smaller dinner or something. 
5. Try to also think about why you want to lose weight. It doesn't have to be health like a lot of people say. Mine is as shallow as I wanna look more fashionable and I feel like I could pull off some outfits better if I were skinnier. 
6. Take progress pics. Sometimes you don't feel like you have changed but when you look back at pics from month ago, you might think otherwise.
7. And again, don't be too hard on yourself. When depression starts talking bad about you, talk back. Tell depression that it is just some ugly pathetic no one and their opinion doesn't matter. Give it a name. Mine is Fork. When bad thoughts take over my mind, I stop my self and say: ""F you Fork! U pathetic sh*t. You don't know what you are talking about. I am giving my best and I am doing well! U need to get lost!!"" Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. As time goes on, it works more since I notice Fork more. Before I thought those were my thoughts, now I know it is Fork. First and foremost you need to get better, then weight loss gets a lot easier as well!

I am rooting for you and sending love!!"
