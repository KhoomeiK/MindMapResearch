Looking back I can type most friends that I’ve had before knowing mbti as well. 

I have an INFP sister who’s as good as me at typing others so it’s fun when we say it at the same time or have the same opinion of strangers we hear talking when we’re out or analysing people for fun when we’re on the train etc

mbti,f3b81v5,t3_dgeda0,1570804028.0,"This happened to me with my INFP friend. She was extremely depressed and talked about the same stuff as your friend. All she was interested in was putting others down, and everything they did was “dumb”, “cringe” and “stupid”. She couldn’t accept that they thought differently to her, and tried to mould them to what she thought was best, instead of embracing their positive traits.

It got to the point where I joined the list of people she would put down and she lost everyone in the end. I checked up on her but kept my distance for my own happiness. She was extremely toxic. But at the same time not ready for any advice or help because to her everyone else was the problem.

What helped her the most was me suddenly keeping a distance. And also changing the subject to positive topics and interesting ideas that we could grow together from. It distracted her from toxic thoughts etc. 

I decided not to pull her up on it too much because I could tell she already hated herself and I was worried about making her feel worse. She got the message without being told from watching the change in me.

After spending allot of time alone and going to Uni she is back to normal. I’m always going to be close with her. But we’re mature enough to know that not speaking every week doesn’t mean that we’re not friends."

Being an INFP im fairly good at picking up how others are feeling, even when they are hiding it. It also depends on the situation if I ask them what’s wrong. How much they’re trying to hide it and when it feels too invasive or just plain weird to ask.

I judge the situation first and sometimes just give them some space and later do something fun to cheer them up. I’ve noticed that ENTPs appreciate this and that it helps them. 

I’m surprised the INFPs you knew acted like that. I’m sorry on their behalf lol. I’ve clicked with every ENTP I’ve met and have never been offended by them:). I find it funny and refreshing how free you are.

The ENTP I know went through a similar situation to you. Everyone seemed to cling to her and expect lots from her so she just started sitting in her car at lunch and break times. She ended up snapping at each person and picking out all their faults in one explosive argument, then leaving.

Her only friends were me and my INFP sister who’s now her best friend of 4 years. We just left her to it and understood from having similar opinions on people. I guess it just depends how independent, sensitive and developed the INFP is. Also helps to know MBTI to work on yourself, so maybe those INFPs were just lost. Lol

I cant have any friends that aren’t independent it just doesn’t work. So I hope you find some better INFPs out there:,)"
