airsoft,fi84gkk,t1_fi8466e,1582233284.0,"So that'll be m110 without tensioners. Also check of you have good airseal. If your cylinder is well sealed, check between cylinder head - hop up unit
Edit: youtube has good videos about upgrading VSR-10 type guns"
airsoft,fi7w689,t3_f6ymxc,1582229271.0,"Weak spring. Buy a m140-150 and take your tensioners off. M140 spring will give you about 420fps, M150 = about 450fps. Assuming you got a good airseal"
airsoft,fh8q69m,t3_f1jupx,1581365086.0,Do you have an airseal between the nozzle and your hop up bucking? Had a similar problem once
Guildwars2,evxw3rm,t1_evxw1a1,1564910798.0,Been wondering if it'll be more profitable to salvage and sell all the materials or just sell all the unid green and blue gear. What is your opinion on this?
cripplingalcoholism,evqkul2,t1_evqkrsa,1564693839.0,"Also, drink a lot of water"
cripplingalcoholism,evqkrsa,t3_cktqpe,1564693810.0,You are going on a trip of your life. Stay safe :D
alcohol,evqjy9v,t3_ciqexq,1564693497.0,"Yup, that's bad. Try to figure out a way to make yourself drink about once every week at first, and start adding up sober days until you drink once very 2-4months. Being an alcoholic is not fun"
raisedbynarcissists,epl9k8g,t1_epk4w9h,1559290613.0,I hope it all goes well
depression_help,epjbgmq,t1_epjb5hc,1559251244.0,Hope she starts recovering some time soon. I appreciate your efforts on helping her ^-^
depression_help,epjb3ch,t3_buybcd,1559251059.0,"Sometimes even having someone who listens is a big help. If she is harming herself, try to advice her to stop cutting and use a rubberband (less scars as reminders of the bad times) but that doesn't happen overnight. If she is okay with talking to you about her depression and is open about it, try to make her feel so that she isn't going through it alone. 

No idea if this helps or not, but I hope it does. I can try to give more advice if you need, so i'll keep checking on this post from time to time"
depression,epj9u1v,t3_brsy1y,1559250400.0,"Sometimes. The all-good-everything times usually don't last long, and all of a sudden I distance myself from everyone. Periods differ a lot from time to time, depending on what's going on. 

Try to enjoy the small things in life. It'll help a lot, altough it may take years; as it is not an easy task and depression will haunt you through your life.

If you have survived all these years, i'm sure you'll be able to see yourself grow into a fine human being ^-^"
raisedbynarcissists,epj5ce1,t3_buq6jv,1559247640.0,"If your father isn't abusive or an enabler, then it is possible. If he has not tried to force to talk or spend time with your mom, then it is okay. Haven't been in any kind of contact with my mom for 5 years, but I talk to my dad every day.

Sorry for this comment, never been good at explaining stuff nor have I ever been good at english"
