Headphones I've loved: HE-6, HD700, SRH1540, my favourite favourite is Tesla T1, my favourite headphone by far

Dislikes: HE-560, HD800 is meh

Looking for: I want a nice clean sound that can be warm. I dont need super strong bass, but I definitely dont want it super flat. I like headphones that give you good vibes while also sounding good, I dont care whats analytical or proper. 

Other: I'm probably gonna use it with an amp $75-$100 but i'm ok with upgrading the source later. It will be on PC with a usb dac

Music: Hip hop, R&B, EDM, and doom metal. I like headphones that can sound good with shitty sources,like the T1 was so forgiving but the HD800 made bad stuff sound like shit

I prefer open or at least semi open, but I'm down for closed if they have good isolation (not noise cancelling) I have big ears, I want a big over ear headphone. No grados lol. Also i've had hifiman break on me so many times, so nothing from them please

thank you so much in advance, I appreciate any advice"
BipolarReddit,fr2z9sr,t1_fr2r67g,1589846791.0,you're over hyping it
BipolarReddit,fr2m2r4,t1_fr2gf4u,1589839692.0,"what lol. As someone with 10+ interactions on there, they all just say the same generic ""increases side effects as xyz"" That's just misinformation

When I was taking CBD at first I noticed them (headache, dizziness, nausea, etc) all went away after regular use for two weeks (as it would with a lot of other meds) Obviously read them and check them, but just know that the vast majority are fine. The ones to really watch out for are beta blockers (which I take) which can lower your blood pressure with CBD. Which is why you can feel drowsy. But thats at high doses anyways

But, you should still watch the heck out for it. It's much much better for mental illness, and it is the more promising treatment option for you. My psychiatrist approved of my usage after I talked about my experience with it

I was going to leave a comment to mention CBD but I guess that will be this one"

I have schizophrenia so I have experience with psychosis, and weed makes those symptoms worse. But, when I take CBD it alleviates a lot of them. If I ever smoke too much and start getting psychotic symptoms, I smoke CBD and it helps it a lot

So from my anecdotal experience, it could potentially help yes. I would definitely try it at least"

Before I had my diagnosis, I felt like such a faker too. I remember some people in a schizophrenic discord were mean to me about it

But now that I have my diagnoses in writing, I feel so much more comfortable posting on these subs. Without it, I'd honestly feel like I'm invading in a group of people that have xyz mental illness, and that my problems were too small to matter, and I shouldnt post

It also makes me get treated much better when I can mention my disability. It helped me get so much assistance in school, and also people treat me differently when they know what I'm going through. It helps me show them I'm just someone with serious illness, I'm not just some person that is lazy and a disappointment. 

I'm thankful I have gotten it, because before that it was a serious dilemma in my life. Now I can rest easy, when I go to new doctors I can show them proof and they treat me more serious when they know the extent of my disorders"
