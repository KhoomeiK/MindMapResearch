Part of the problem is sometimes you get the impression that everyone here wants to be the next Snowden to the point of almost being paranoid: everything has to be encrypted, has to be based in a country that is not one of the however many eyes there are now, etc, and that may just be overkill for your case and feeds your anxiety because they’re always more that you could be doing.

There are tradeoffs and you need to find what works for you. For example, I’m still going to use iOS for example because it’s a reasonable trade-off between convenience and privacy for me. Same with other services: try to diversify and find services that fit what you are after.

The fact of the matter is: if you use Brave/Firefox, DDG, a proper ad blocker, and you start checking privacy policies you’re much better off privacy-wise than the vast majority of the population. Move your email from Gmail to a privacy-respecting alternative and that’s another huge step forward. Anything beyond that is just a bonus really."

Sure enough, I get there and they were waiting for me. The pharmacist who was waiting for me is one that I’ve only briefly interacted with when I pick stuff up every now and then, but I’m sure she recognizes me from my many visits.

When I saw her waiting and thanked her, I just kept thinking about she always there and always nice. Even now, she’s still there.

encryption,fj0b5ph,t1_fizs14j,1582895356.0,">	1. Correct. If somebody has your password they can login and see everything. It does not make Mailbox more secure per se unless you go to the trouble of storing Mailbox'es two keys in separate systems so if one gets stolen, the other does not. Use 2FA if you can.

That makes sense. But wouldn’t Mailbox’s other passphrase for the keys make it more difficult to read anything (besides metadata) even if the password was compromised since you have to go through another layer of security?

Also, their 2FA implementation is very weird so I don’t think I will use it (they replace the password with a 4 digit PIN and you append the 6 digit OTP to that every time you log in). This is one reason I’m using encryption as an extra layer of security.

I’m also thinking about making my main email address something weird that I never give out and handing out just the aliases. So even if my password gets stolen, my primary email address is still hidden. I don’t know if that’s a good or idea or not.

>	2.	Correct. If they offer IMAP the emails will be sent to you unencrypted and readable at your end. Because email is plaintext. However, they need an active IMAP connection to do so, because that password is needed to decrypt the emails.

Ah, I see.
