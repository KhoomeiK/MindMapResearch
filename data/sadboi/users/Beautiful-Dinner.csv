you can create your own and share it on facebook group, reddit group, etc... i was working on adding a ticker for most popular rooms. so people can see what rooms other people like, (they seem to like that) if anyone wants to help with this do contact me.  also, you can be depressed in any room. no labelling required, although not recommended. the whole idea in posting here was to facilitate those who are less depressed if they particpate in voice chat. so going to a room to be depressed is not really the goal, but going to a room to be less depressed could be. others suggest just leaving the room and going outside, but thats another story.
