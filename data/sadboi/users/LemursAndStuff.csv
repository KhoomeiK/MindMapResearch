SkincareAddiction,fq6ngzb,t3_gg8h07,1589134921.0,"Hello all! I need some help finding products to try to help reduce acne scarring/texture. 

I‚Äôm looking specifically for extremely gentle products that still yield results. My skin is really picky and breaks out in horrible little bumps over like 90% of products I try. I‚Äôm currently on a quest to reinvent my routine after realizing this. Moisturizer is the most difficult to find, so I‚Äôm dealing with a not so great moisturizer barrier situation. All that combined with being on tretinoin topical means that products with strong actives are a recipe for a dry, red disaster. 

Now that I‚Äôm at the point where none of my basic products break me out, want to slowly try to introduce another active product to help me work on my scarring. Pls drop suggestions !! 


My current routine is: 

AM: wash with water (or Innisfree Volcanic Pore Cleanser), Simple Skincare Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, La Roche Posay Anhelios Oil Free Sunscreen SPF 60

PM: I use mineral oil/baby oil as a makeup remover if I have makeup on, Innisfree Volcanic Pore Cleanser, Tretinoin 0.05% (2-3x a week), First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cannabis & Oat Dry Oil, Simple Skincare Replenishing Rich Moisturizer"
SkincareAddiction,fq6l7hz,t3_ggumln,1589133660.0,"New purchase/rave: First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cannabis & Oat Dry Oil

I got this as a free sample, and I hesitantly tried it out. I‚Äôm so glad I did!!

My skin is a pain in the ass with any moisturizer or hydrating products. Nearly all moisturizers break me out, and the ones that don‚Äôt are extremely ‚Äúneutral,‚Äù aka they have barely anything in them and don‚Äôt do much. I know my moisture barrier is likely damaged. I‚Äôve been undergoing acne treatment for years, there‚Äôs no way it isn‚Äôt. But I just can‚Äôt get my skin to tolerate products that can help!! Frustrating ugh. 

Enter this dry oil. I‚Äôm a total convert to dry oils now I think. This is my second dry oil that I‚Äôve tried and they don‚Äôt seem to give me those horrible little bumps all over - and I‚Äôm 10 days into using it! I‚Äôve been using it in combination with my other moisturizer and my skin feels so much softer and less textured. This is pretty much what I‚Äôve been hoping to get a moisturizer to do but without the irritation of trying to a product that doesn‚Äôt have some kind of cream in it that my face hates. 

I‚Äôm so glad I took a chance on this product and maybe have found some solutions to my moisturizer conundrum !!"

mentalillness,fo61o55,t3_g5nrye,1587543180.0,"Obviously can‚Äôt diagnose but it‚Äôs highly likely that it is bipolar. What you described sounds very much like a severe mania brought on by your SSRI (based on my experiences being manic). You only need one manic episode in your entire life for the diagnosis to switch from regular depression to bipolar but mostly depressive episodes. However, I‚Äôd keep an eye on your moods and see if you catch any hypomanic symptoms that may be flying under the radar. 

Being put on 5 meds seems very extreme, although I‚Äôve seen it happen too much. I in general have beef with psych professionals lol."
bipolar,fo60q0z,t3_g5wq5s,1587542182.0,"Oh no ): sorry you are going through this. Since you‚Äôre struggling with OCD and PTSD as well, I think it‚Äôs likely this could be related to those and not so much a mania thing if you‚Äôre not otherwise feeling manic. When your body is in scared mode, it will *not* let you sleep. Fight or flight will power you through. I‚Äôve definitely had this with OCD myself albeit for different reasons, where I cannot sleep until I‚Äôve done certain tasks (must shower in a specific way first, must make sure the bed is suitably clean, etc).  I‚Äôve seen it happen for people I know who are dealing with trauma too. When you‚Äôre not feeling safe you‚Äôre going to stay on high alert, which also could be where the hypervigilant paranoia thoughts are coming from. 

Definitely definitely bring this up with your therapist. Do you do CBT with them? CBT therapy was immensely helpful for my OCD and is definitely worth looking into if you‚Äôre not doing it already. 

In terms of the insomnia, you might want to start a temporary sleep aid, depending on how bad it is. I‚Äôve found lithium to be wonderful for manic energy, but it‚Äôs not really sedating. If you can‚Äôt get a doc to adjust meds due to the current circumstances, you could also try OTC melatonin at night"

trichotillomania,fo1z7hs,t3_g4mhl0,1587445142.0,"Hey ! wanted to say a couple of things. 

You‚Äôre right about heritability - most of the current research is leaning in the direction of it being partly inherited. It also may be useful to see if anyone in your immediate family has OCD, or any kind of habit/addiction issues as they‚Äôre all related. 

As for the gender split, last I‚Äôd seen it was about 70/30, but for skin picking it‚Äôs almost even. My theory on this is that women are more likely to discuss mild cases with their doctor because of pressures on women‚Äôs grooming habits. A guy who pulls a little bit may be much less distressed than a girl. That‚Äôs just my theory tho 

And yeah it really hugely sucks that so few doctors know about it /: But at least we have these kinds of communities w people who get it"

All of these types of services say they have a legit panel of real providers and are virtually equivalent to seeing a professional in person, and yet if you‚Äôre on other meds they seem to always refuse you as a patient. That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

I pretty much totally redesigned Trailblazer‚Äôs whole character too bc I felt there wasn‚Äôt much to work with besides ‚Äúshe‚Äôs nice,‚Äù but I kept the backpack gimmick.

BipolarReddit,fnwtuo6,t3_g3uz6n,1587325332.0,"This is actually something that I, and a lot of different mental health professionals, have thought a lot about. It‚Äôs actually kind of a problem. People who have impairment to the point that it is difficult for them to work or support themselves independently do need a higher level of care, and we don‚Äôt really know what to do for them right now. 

As you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôve been hospitalized in the past, modern day inpatient hospitals are best equipped for what approximates in a two to three week stay. They have very limited space (usually a hospital ward with one activity room), maybe a small outside courtyard, and not much else. They are pretty much a temporary holding place to stabilize you out of acute danger.

For longer term options, there‚Äôs really not much. There are residential treatment facilities, but they are usually private and very costly. They also are not for indefinite stay, maybe more like 5 months or so, but for people who can‚Äôt work this still doesn‚Äôt help. State hospitals exist, but they‚Äôre often very poorly managed and overcrowded, and people dread ending up there. Unfortunately jails have also served as a holding place for mentally ill people, who in actuality would be far better served by a supportive care facility even though they have committed minor offenses. 

The closest to a legitimate replacement for the notion of the asylum, in my opinion, are assisted living facilities. Supportive housing communities are trying to be a more integrated version of what asylums were meant to provide: comfortable accommodations where you can focus on your health without fear of eviction because people are helping you get through the ADLs - activities of daily living. Assisted living has a whole host of issues though; many are underfunded and are very poor quality housing, they may be understaffed or have extremely long wait times, because it‚Äôs more like dorm style housing you may be roomed with people you dislike and be unable to move, you likely still have to pay bills and do your own shopping (and SSI/SSDI is a pitifully small amount of money). 

The idea of dissolving asylums (aside from the whole human rights violations stuff - im talking like on principles here) was to transition mentally ill people from being sequestered away in a solitary building, so they could participate more in society. While I tend to agree with this shift, I‚Äôve been to residential and there‚Äôs certainly some therapeutic value to just being away from it all in a nice big building that takes care of you where you don‚Äôt have panic attacks about your electric bill. But maybe that‚Äôs more indicative that society as a whole needs to change, idk. 

Anyway huge rambly rant but tl;dr we‚Äôre still trying to figure out how to navigate this issue tbh"

The reason I think you may lean on the warmer side of neutral is that the image with the sort of brick red shadow & lipstick really brightens & complements your face imo, whereas the silver shadow seems to get a bit lost. That to me says you likely lean warm.

TrollMUA,fnuxle7,t1_fnum1k0,1587273853.0,":0 so in this look I THINK the shadow was actually a really dark navy blue BUT kinda beside the point as it still is a pain in the ass to blend out. 

So I think my best tip is to go slow and veeeery sparingly with the dark color. A little goes a long way and once it‚Äôs there it is *there.* I use a smaller, denser brush like a sigma e55 type style bc I find anything too fluffy just gets muddy and messy (plus it‚Äôs a pain to clean black off fluffy brushes üò≠) 

I also usually use 2-3 transition/blending shades of increasing lightness - in this case a kind of dark reddish brown, then the orange, then my fav transition shade which is basically my skin color. When I do true black I usually transition it w browns bc I‚Äôm super warm toned but it‚Äôs also definitely doable with taupe or grey !

Naltrexone (May be a good option if you have substance abuse/alcohol issues in your family)
Lamictal (mood stabilizer - some people say this has helped them)
Abilify (antipsychotic type antidepressant - also heard of some limited success) 
Small doses of zyprexa or haldol (these are heavier medications and have heavy side effects so you may want to weigh the risks) 
SSRIs like Prozac (have heard of some limited success on these as well, especially if pulling is linked to anxiety for you) 

There is also the over the counter supplement NAC - many people have some success with this (including me!)
Tips with NAC: 
-take 2000-3000mg. It seems like a lot but that‚Äôs how much was used in the clinical trial proving its efficacy 
-some brands are better than others - it‚Äôs a supplement so brands matter. NOW and Swanson are both reputable 
-NAC has very few side effects but some people get an upset stomach. I‚Äôd recommend starting at a lower amount and seeing how you tolerate it before raising all the way up to the full mg. 
-it smells kinda bad lol ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Other things about trich and meds:
No med is proved to be effective to treat Trichotillomania. Some of the meds above may work better if you know your trich is related to other symptoms like anxiety, ocd, addiction, or impulse control, but the meds aren‚Äôt actually approved for treating trich itself. 
Also, avoid ADHD meds like Adderal and Vyvanse if you can help it, they are known to worsen trich urges in some people.

BipolarReddit,fntajvh,t3_g3p3b8,1587237812.0,"Hey! Sounds like your girlfriend has been through a lot and it‚Äôs very cool of you to want to help her! 

With any mental health condition, it is MOST important to have open communication. People with mental health disorders have needs that others do not, so it‚Äôs super important that you figure out what things are helpful and what are not. It‚Äôs also necessary that you can communicate your needs to her, because your wellbeing is important too. 

It is very difficult to give broad general advice as everyone‚Äôs situation is different. Bipolar can look very different in different people, so try to figure out what hers looks like. Mine for example primarily consists of mania, whereas my boyfriend‚Äôs is mostly depression. My boyfriend helps me take my meds on time, let‚Äôs me know when I am behaving strangely (sometimes I can‚Äôt tell), and has even brought me stuff while I was hospitalized! I help him challenge his anxious thoughts, get him get out of bed and to his obligations when it‚Äôs overwhelming, and help him deal with an abusive family situation.

Do research about the conditions she has. Bipolar is a good place to start, but it seems like she may also be dealing with PTSD. Looking into trauma responses will likely be very helpful. You mentions she blacks out or dissociates - this is definitely something to talk about and learn about, that can be hard to deal with for everyone. Learning about how people cope with trauma in both healthy and unhealthy ways will probably help you understand her situation more deeply than just looking at bipolar info. 

Communication is key I can‚Äôt stress enough. Setting boundaries, making needs clear, telling each other when something is working and when it isn‚Äôt is absolutely crucial when managing a relationship with mental illness. And it also just makes for a healthy relationship in general üòä"
BipolarReddit,fnrj5zc,t3_g2xb6o,1587190601.0,"I‚Äôm currently not considering having kids (21yo and in school) but I would certainly not rule it out. Both my partner and I have mental health issues so it‚Äôs likely our child would also have something.  

I don‚Äôt really buy into the narrative that we (mentally ill/disabled people) should not have kids to keep from ‚Äúspreading‚Äù our conditions. Of course bipolar disorder has affected my life very seriously, but it in no way ruined my life. I would not discount having a child on the basis that they may have my condition. If anything, I will be more prepared to deal with it than my parents who knew nothing about it. 

Speaking of my parents, neither of them had any diagnoses and they still had a kid who had multiple mental health conditions. Healthy parents have disabled kids too, it‚Äôs just something you have to accept may happen when becoming a parent I think.

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôll be more prepared than most people to have a kid if I ever do lol. I have concerns about pregnancy, PPD, etc but I would be in close contact with my doctor like anyone with any health condition would be. Like I said before, not for at least for five ish years given where i‚Äôm at in life, but beyond that I think it would be doable. 

I do not like the idea that bipolar disorder should disqualify me as a parent in any way. It‚Äôs very circumstantial. Someone with well managed bipolar is equally as good a candidate for parenthood as anyone else - everyone has things they are dealing with, mine are mostly mental and that‚Äôs ok. I would not feel guilty about having a bipolar child, to be guilty about that would be to imply that my bipolar child is less than, that I‚Äôm less than and my partner is less than for having mental health issues. And I simply don‚Äôt believe that to be true. 

Tl;dr I would have kids and yes they‚Äôd probably be bipolar too and I‚Äôm ok with that"
BipolarReddit,fnrhk5t,t3_g30m13,1587189160.0,"Hey ! That sounds like being genderfluid to me.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a definite bipolar thing, since a lot of people who are bipolar don‚Äôt have that. 

I identify as nonbinary and I have moments where I feel very strongly feminine or masculine, but I haven‚Äôt noticed that my gender ‚Äúswings‚Äù are correlated with my mood changes. I used to think I would always go high femme while manic (mostly because I would dress up and shop) but my most recent manic episode coincided with my most intense boy mode moment yet so i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre connected for me. 

I do see where you‚Äôre coming from though and I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes my gender dysphoria aka wanting to look like a boy occurs most strongly when I‚Äôm upset about other things and already in a negative headspace."

Definitely do some research into what places accept Medicare first, because price is a huge factor. I never could have afforded residential if not for my insurance coverage. 

Other options if true residential doesn‚Äôt pan out would be an acute partial hospitalization program or something of that nature - 5 days a week all day. those programs are usually a lot more accessible in terms of wait time and insurance, and often are equally as helpful imo."

NonBinary,fnnu9lo,t3_g2mjxq,1587101913.0,"First of all. Absolutely valid ! Being nonbinary means that you don‚Äôt identify as a binary gender and nothing more. You can look like the toughest man or the softest girl and be nonbinary as fuc.

As for presenting, I‚Äôm busty as well and also fluid. When I‚Äôm trying to be in masc mode I find that working *with* my body shape rather than against often works better for me. There‚Äôs only so much I can do to minimize my boob, they‚Äôre just big /: and as a fluid person I don‚Äôt plan on starting hormones or getting surgery at the moment, so I‚Äôm really just working with what I have. 

Some of my biggest inspirations are butch ladies!! Following Butch women for fashion inspo often yields a much more elegant masc silhouette on a fem body than trying to force cis mens fashion onto my thicc self. A lot of male fashion icons are very tall and lanky and very very not curvy which is kind of like. The exact opposite of me lol

some ladies clothes you can really ‚Äúmascify‚Äù by switching up the accessories. So since I‚Äôm basically forced to wear ladies button ups (EVERY men‚Äôs shirt gaps on me even when I‚Äôm binding ugh) if I pair it with more straight cut jeans, mens shoes and a masc jacket, the ladyness of the shirt is toned way down. My binary trans friend wears almost exclusively women‚Äôs cut jeans bc they just fit better, but it‚Äôs not an issue for him presentation wise because he wears them with other guy clothes and reads masculine. So there‚Äôs definitely ways to work with being curvy 

(Bear in mind I‚Äôm not hugely concerned with straight up passing as a guy, more being read as masculine/androgynous)."
NonBinary,fnns4ae,t3_g2r7x5,1587100104.0,Oh yess all the time.

NonBinary,fnnrof1,t3_g2s4c0,1587099752.0,"Hey, not AMAB but relate to a lot of what you said. I don‚Äôt feel incredibly strong body dysphoria, nor do I have what I would consider a poor body image. I think for a very long time I was very neutral leaning positive about my physical body, but to some extent I just felt extraordinarily not connected to it. While I could recognize that I have breasts and I don‚Äôt hate them or feel negatively towards them, there are often stretches of time where looking down at my chest feels like I‚Äôm looking at a costume. Like they‚Äôre placed there but not actually part of me. I heavily identified with drag performers for a while (still do a bit) because I felt like being a woman was really mostly an ongoing performance. A performance that I was pretty good at, but just a performance that I was kind of taking off when I was alone. 

But I had good self esteem and I thought of myself as doing things to be (like you mentioned) a cool positive role model for girls. Acknowledging I have gender dysphoria eluded me for a long time because I was confused by it. I mostly knew binary trans people who had ultra strong dysphoria early on and hated how they looked until they began to transition and I thought well that‚Äôs not me so I must just have some weird self esteem issue. Or internalized misogyny making me think I need to be a girly femme woman. 

Honestly the final nail in the coffin for me was this past year, I was put in a psych hospital and they put me on the all women‚Äôs floor without asking. And I just couldn‚Äôt tolerate it. The space was designed so that women could feel comfortable and all have that connection and shared experience and it just felt all wrong and weird to me. I felt like such an outsider. I asked to be moved to a mixed gender unit and immediately I felt better. Since then I haven‚Äôt been able to deny the enby ID. 

I ID as nonbinary, leaning towards genderfluid. There are many aspects of femininity that I enjoy, especially the more performance-y dress up parts. But I do not feel like I *am* a woman."

Marvel,flf15ou,t3_foggsx,1585095739.0,"Ok so we all know about the debacle with these character designs and how they‚Äôre bad and also offensive. And since I‚Äôm sitting around my house bored thanks to the ol virus I decided to do a redesign. Left to right: 
.
Snowflake and Trigger (Safespace renamed) are psychic twins. Snowflake‚Äôs ironic name reflects their ability to manipulate water and ice. You ever head that thing about how an icicle would be the perfect murder weapon? Yeah. Trigger, one minute older and significantly taller, can ‚Äòtrigger‚Äô his force field generating abilities by snapping his fingers. When close enough together and with a strong psychic connection, they can merge their powers, becoming significantly stronger. Both are nonbinary now.

Screentime‚Äôs powers come from his absorption of so called ‚Äúinternet gas‚Äù emitted through his goggles. The gas gives him all kinds of stupid powers like being a genius (he does the planning and coordination), also being a genius (he can think extremely quickly to solve problems on the fly) and being a big genius (creating gadgets to assist him). He‚Äôs also a massive edgy know it all. 

Clairvoya‚Äôs (Trailblazer renamed) powers are more inert - she has a connection to some supernatural or spiritual force through her backpack (she says it‚Äôs an angel, she‚Äôs catholic). The deity grants her abilities given the situation; her powers are only activated by mediation with the spirit - without it she only has her sharp wit and mortal body.

B-Negative is a vampire, and he has vampire powers. He‚Äôs also goth. He is not goth because he is a vampire, don‚Äôt be rude. Many people are goth, he just happens to also be a vampire. He‚Äôs the introvert and loner of the group, not because he‚Äôs goth or because he‚Äôs a vampire don‚Äôt be presumptuous. He‚Äôs just a very moody teenager.

Art is mine, characters owned by their respective designers. 

Please feel free to give your own input on how to spice this mess up!"
bipolar,flau12i,t3_fno0xz,1584991110.0,"I‚Äôve had this happen while manic, both in a positive(?) and negative way.

One specific time I can think of was I came onto the train platform as the train was just arriving and I felt like the train arrived on time just for me.

I ended up having to toss several products when reorganizing my makeup drawers (one of many social distancing projects). I had a few expired lipsticks and mascaras that truly had to go despite being over half unused /: oh well, fuel for the fire to actually pan some stuff"
SkincareAddiction,fl8cyoo,t3_fn9kf6,1584920863.0,"Hey ! I had something similar happen when I moved from my dorm to living on my own in an apartment. I never figured out *exactly* what the cause was, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a combination of new stress, different air quality/living conditions, and an increase in sensitivity to products. 

I have very sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and I get hormonal and stress related breakouts often. Like you, I usually have bigger, more painful acne that comes to a ‚Äúhead‚Äù after a while. After moving I got something similar to what you‚Äôre describing - smaller red bumps that never seemed to go away. 

What I think helped the most in getting rid of this was carefully monitoring the products I was using. I‚Äôve always had sensitive skin, but in recent years my skin has reacted badly to a huge number of products that I used to use just fine. I also am very careful with what comes in contact with my face skin - including shampoo, body lotions, even cleaning products on my hands. Various things trigger this kind of breakout for me but idk exactly what it is or if it‚Äôs one thing specifically. I also think it‚Äôs related to having a lot of dairy in my diet. When I drink a lot of coffee with milk (which I was doing at work) I invariably get one of these breakouts. 

Anyways yeah, take a very close inventory of what comes in contact with your skin, and see if you can sus out any correlations. These bumps were super annoying for me so good luck!!"

There‚Äôs also the possibility that you could be misdiagnosed, if you‚Äôre really concerned you could try to consult another dr.

Hopefully the people here can be better enby friends. Honestly I‚Äôve found a lot of identity focused spaces to be kinda toxic. I think focusing too much on what type of person you are becomes very redundant and divisive very fast. You can be a nonbinary trans man and that‚Äôs fine. A lot of online enbies are very....aggressive about what labels you can and can‚Äôt use but most of that doesn‚Äôt really follow people off the internet save for some very ‚Äúhyperwoke‚Äù spaces that are easily avoidable. I‚Äôve met a few of the twitter types irl but I hang out almost exclusively with other LGBT people and the vast majority don‚Äôt behave in that aggressive identity policing way.

Trichsters,fkj83u5,t3_f8kqyq,1584238676.0,"Hey! It‚Äôs widely accepted among the trich community that, whether you want to categorize it as stimming or not (many people associate stimming with autism and many people who pull are not autistic), pulling/picking is a ‚Äúregulation‚Äù behavior. Basically, the pulling self soothes or self regulates when we are feeling overwhelmed, excited, anxious, bored, focused or any number of excitable emotions. Many people pull when they‚Äôre anxious but many people also pull when they feel positively, which absolutely confounds a lot of medical professionals, but makes a lot of sense if you think of it as a type of stim. Like stimming, pulling provides some sort of regulatory function that is not limited to negative emotions, hence why I and many others pull when excited or very focused on something. 

I personally wouldn‚Äôt categorize it as simply a stim because it is a very complex behavior. For me, I think that there is also an addictive or compulsive aspect, and a little bit of that OCD/corrective thing that some people have a lot more strongly (like needing to ‚Äúfix‚Äù a hairline etc)."
NonBinary,fkcxjgl,t3_fgje4k,1584063464.0,"Pretty straightforward for me. Sometimes I have lots of dysphoria, like, looking at my hips and chest makes me feel gross dysphoria.

BipolarReddit,fkctxmm,t3_fhaxyc,1584061070.0,"It really depends. I‚Äôve done virtually all levels of care, psychiatry, various 1 on 1 therapies, outpatient groups, partial hospitalization, inpatient stays and residential treatment programs. I‚Äôve had great benefits from all experiences at different times and for different needs. 

Imo, the most important thing is to be seeing someone who you trust and connect with. You can see a psychiatrist 5x a week who you hate and get nowhere, or one every 4 months who really gets what you need and have success. 

To start seeing a psychiatrist I think they usually want you to come 2x a month or once a month, while you are figuring things out. Once you‚Äôre on a combo that you like, you can cut it back. I go once a month bc my insurance insists, but really I could go every six months for a check in and lab work if allowed. 

Therapy I would highly recommend weekly appointments, I personally have not seen any improvement going less than weekly. I know people have monetary restrictions but if it‚Äôs at all possible that‚Äôs what I would recommend."

Extreme emotional attachment, especially to specific people
Strong abandonment issues 
Lack of a coherent personal identity 
Very rapid cycling emotional states (think happy to sad to euphoria to anger to dissociation, often in the course of a day. There is rapid cycling bipolar but as with any bipolar mood shifts it‚Äôs going from depressive to manic - it‚Äôs somewhat of a different experience or so I‚Äôve been told) 
Moods change in response to stimuli (bipolar moods often happen with no distinct trigger)
Persistent self harm (it‚Äôs a diagnostic criteria for BPD, and not for bipolar)
Trauma history 

Bipolar typically responds better to meds than BPD, which responds best to therapy, specifically DBT 

There‚Äôs a bit of overlap, especially between bipolar 2, and rapid cycling bipolar. Overall the biggest difference is the interpersonal stuff. Bipolar doesn‚Äôt really cause any specific issues with strong issues of attachment, having favorite people, or chronic loneliness
