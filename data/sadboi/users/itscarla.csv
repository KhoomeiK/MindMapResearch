Still don’t understand why but oh well. I guess the sense of knowing everything. I live in another country now, so even though I’ve been here for a year, it still seems like a weird place to me. I guess?"

science,f4wts3m,t3_dlz9j2,1571859643.0,"My husband is the one working full time and I am currently not work due some personal reasons but I do some freelance work from home so I’m basically home all the time and I put myself responsible of chores and cooking. 

The one thing that bothers me is: if I’m keeping the house clean, does it hurt to put whatever in the right place? Or not leave it in the middle of the house? 

Or even on weekends, maybe wash the dishes or something, scrub the toilet bowl once in your life... I feel like it’s not unfair to ask for some of these things - even if he’s working full time. Keep in mind during the week I am the one doing everything. The one thing he is actually responsible for (he put it on himself) is laundry and then the weekend comes and he only wants to sleep, or “forgets about it” which pisses me off but I just don’t say anything anymore because of this idea that since he’s the one doing the work I should just suck it up and do whatever I’m supposed to at home. And then the guilt comes for not being able to work but part of me still think it’s not a lot to ask for, because I’m still gonna have to do the house chores when I find a job. 

Because it’s supposed to be a partnership, right?"
