Parenting,fe51rcg,t3_enlvnp,1578864904.0,"You‚Äôre doing amazing. Just the fact that you are so present in his life, you want to be there, you take care of him and you haven‚Äôt pawned him off on family because of your young age is winning 100%. Parenting is hard! My husband and I are first-time parents and it‚Äôs insanely fucking hard too, we totally feel you! As far as his tummy issues, once he turns one- try and switch him to goats milk. It sounds like he may have an issue with the dairy in regular formula. EU Holle or HiPP goats milk can help his belly if it‚Äôs still messed up. Everything else you described, sounds like you really taking the time and making the effort to bond with your son. It just gets better from here!! Read him books and tell him how much you love him often and keep doing you! It is normal to be stressed but give yourself a hug and pat on the back, you sound like an amazing dad!!"

More concerning is the IBM article showing that it is not unrealistic to do the same thing on a classical computer with a few clever tricks.

But does anyone want to die? Or isn‚Äôt afraid of death? Why aren‚Äôt they in a whirlwind of emotion about negative energy and the like? 

Or do I just have an overactive imagination and this is how my fears present themselves?

Anxiety,ettbrn4,t1_etqxhhc,1563172226.0,"I don‚Äôt make sense of any of it! Nothing traumatizing as far as physically or mentally really ever happened to me.

I wish I could, honestly the anxiety is causing me to lose more sleep. I guess the most recent traumatizing thing that had happened is that my husband and I suddenly woke to our sons breathing monitor going off like crazy. When we picked him up he was unresponsive and we were even yelling his name and stuff and he came too after what seemed like forever but I‚Äôm sure was only several seconds.  Yes, definitely true that everything seems more than what it is when you don‚Äôt have sleep."

Also, if you go to the CDC website, many of the diseases we have vaccines for would not kill you, many disease we do not have vaccines for will. So... are you just staying inside 24/7?

No, oils and crystals aren‚Äôt going to heal you, but listening everything that your doctor tells you isn‚Äôt going to heal you either, so. Medical malpractice doesn‚Äôt exist and mistakes in a hospital are often made. The system isn‚Äôt above anyone or infallible. But you know.... You rage on against all those scary, mean, stupid, uneducated antivaxxers. 

Oh by the way, are you up to date with the current CDC schedule and what‚Äôs planned for healthy people 2020? If you haven‚Äôt had your boosters in the past 5-10 yrs or all the shots on the schedule, you ARE unvaccinated according to the CDC and WHO. 

Like OP said, if your kids are vaccinated and you are vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt be anything to worry about, yeah? She‚Äôs obviously not worried about her kids playing with the unvaccinated neighbor. The division between the two sides is a strange thing.  What did people do 1960-2000 when there weren‚Äôt as many vaccines on the schedule? Did everyone shun everyone else because of their choices they made for their families? I don‚Äôt think so."
