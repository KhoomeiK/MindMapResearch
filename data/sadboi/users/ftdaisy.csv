loseit,fo6qdia,t3_g61lyk,1587564677.0,"I would bet it’s definitely from your increased exercise. It’s normal for weight loss to stall when starting a new workout routine. Your body is holding onto more water weight trying to repair your muscles after exercise. Working out has many health benefits outside of weight loss. With that said, I’m focusing on shorter workouts, but still everyday, because I want to see scales losses. If you would rather just keep working out more because it makes you feel good, I would suggest using a metric for loss other than the scale, like taking measurements and progress photos. Just because the scale isn’t responding doesn’t mean you aren’t making progress.
Disordered eating and thoughts around it suck. It’s tough to beat. Don’t give in, and don’t give up!"

Veggies are 90% of my plate and most are cooked in olive oil or coconut oil. I hve fruit after most meals if I want something sweet. I have a very small serving of meat with my lunch and dinner.

Hormones like insulin definitely play a role. I think CICO logic over simplifies weight loss. Our metabolic processes are not as simple as calories in calories out. I don’t think anyone, even scientists and doctors completely understand the metabolic process. Hence the obesity epidemic. Weight Loss is entirely individual and can vary greatly from person to person. I think it’s very important to experiment with your own body and figure out what works best for you. Low carb isn’t optimal for all but it does help a ton of people lose weight so it’s worth trying IMO.


Edit to say - calorie counting is still important when eating low carb. It’s still easy to over eat low carb foods. Eating low carb does not equal weight loss. But, in my experience, it makes it so much easier to eat in a deficit."
