Maybe a switch to a different medium might be wise if painting is the source of your anguish right now. It's such a common thing for artists to get good enough where we finally SEE all our mistakes, but not yet masterful enough to correct them all at once. The thing is, you won't realize how much you've improved until way down the road, right? I promise you, youre being harder on yourself than anyone else would be. I've been in your shoes too, and I empathize with how frustrating and demoralizing this all is. 
That said, you're art is YOURS. No two human brains are identical, and so no one will see your art exactly as you do. You may feel done with your art, but another set of eyes somewhere out there digs it!

If you need a break, that's ok, just know that what you're feeling isn't indicitive of being a bad artist ‚ù§"
ArtistLounge,fnqu068,t3_g3ec7b,1587172195.0,I'm trying to figure this out too. So far what's helped a lot is transferring my sketch onto the paper I'll actually be painting on using a lightbox. And also cleaning up images digitally when I'm done (nothing too major...maybe a bit of outlining here and there and making my whites whiter).

mentalillness,fmx7q3r,t3_fnbomu,1586459985.0,"TW: PTSD, isolation, future dread 

I dread the increased urgency of the mental health crisis during and following this pandemic. My guess is that PTSD and trauma related diagnosis are gonna go through the roof for medical workers who are starved for resources and watching the deathtolls climb right now - hell, same goes for all front line workers who have to chose between staying safe and paying rent. I suffer from C-PTSD and major depression as many others in this subreddit do, and boyhowdy can I vouch for how inaccessible resources are as it is (and that's coming from the privilege of having public healthcare here in Canada).    I'm having this weird realization that the future really is likely to look as bleak as my brain's been fearing this whole time. :/"

ArtistLounge,f09nf7a,t3_d493qi,1568504310.0,"Like others have mentioned, it's a mixed bag... I've been on assorted antidepressants over the years, and I've found that they put a damper on my creativity, but in a different way than depression itself does. When I'm so depressed that I can't art, I feel apathetic AND don't have the energy to do anything even if I wanted to. On antidepressants, that apathy is still there, BUT I have enough energy that if I caaaan push myself to sit down and actually draw, then chances are I'll get into it and find my groove. 
So, for me at least, it takes lots of effort to feel inspired (and even that can be draining), but if I'm open to the feeling when it's strong enough to break through my apathy, then that's something I can use!
Hope this made some sense. üòÖ"
