SuicideWatch,fbse42y,t3_eeaoia,1577053995.0,"I feel alone so much of the time. Ome of the ways I cope is placing more value on the non-romantic relationships I have. Seeing the people I help with volunteer work helps. Doing little things for coworkers and family members that brightens their day helps. Knowing that I have a positive effect on the people around me makes me feel more connected. I also spend a lot of time around animals. No one is better at unconditional love than a dog. 

I hate the way I look. I cope with that by getting tattoos and piercings, or experimenting with my hair. Even if everything else about me is ugly, I create little bits of art on my body that I love. I think having control over how you look in any respect helps with that - clothes, weightlifting, that kind of thing. Finding small things about myself that I like helps too. I may be ugly, but at least the freckle on the inside of my left wrist is cute."
