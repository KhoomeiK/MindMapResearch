lgbt,fqfq3do,t3_ginlyb,1589329509.0,"With the gender identity thing, Maybe try getting very close friends and family to refer to you using she/her pronouns to see if it feels right. 

For your sexuality, really the only way of knowing is by talking to people of all genders and see who you hit it off the most with, maybe you’ll find that you’re romantically attracted to certain genders but sexually attracted to another? 

I don’t think you should make a decision without even trying all your open options out first, so probably would be a good idea to test things rather than making snap decisions.

It’s completely normal to feel confused, take your time.

Also if anything I said in here is incorrect let me know, I’m still learning about sexuality terminology, I’ve only looked into Gender terminology thoroughly so far :)"
