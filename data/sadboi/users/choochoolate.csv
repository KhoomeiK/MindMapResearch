It is more than likely the birth control I'm taking that causes unnecessary lactation. It's been happening for years and I just wipe off the ""crust"" off my nipples. The color of the ""crust"" is an off color (maybe a very light yellow) and the liquid is more clearish/white. I hate when the day comes when I have to explain to a man that not only do I hate my boobs being fondled but I kinda lactate out of my right nipple."
Dreams,fjabns9,t3_fceuzg,1583170231.0,Dude I've been having this type of dream constantly for the past 5 years. Most of my dreams don't change up as I've gotten older and in some way are related but this type of dream is evolving slowly. It's usually never stressing to me and I'm normally very content with being back at school. The thing I don't understand is why the school is slowly changing in my dreams even though that exact high school looks the same 5 years later in real life. I can have consistent dreams about my elementary school and nothing but the bathrooms change sense I almost never used them while the high school slowly changes bit by bit. I'm starting to dream more about college even though I didn't go which I could care less about. I can accept constantly dreaming about being back in school and what not but not that the high school computer labs are filled with Mac Desktops that are 20+ years old. I'm talking about graphics and everything old computers.
