AskReddit,fniyfgn,t3_g1u0ex,1586988599.0,"I work at a local ‘chipotle style’ make your own burrito place. We’re in a college town (Bucknell University). Every saturday is Super Saturday where they all get hammered and party. We’re the spot to go to when they’re fucked up and want lunch. Here’s a list:

- Dude puked on my coworker, the floor, and all over the bathroom. My boss made him clean it but he didn’t do a great job. 

- Some girl asked “what grade are you in?” I’m 19 and took a gap year between college, so I didn’t know how to respond to that. I said i’m not sure how to answer that question. She took that very personally and made a huge scene, calling me a prick. I told her to leave 

- Dude called me the anti-christ because I wasn’t sure how he wanted me to make him a QUESADILLA without cheese. 

- Group of guys called me skinny and told me to go to the gym. I told them to fuck off. 

Food service is great."
