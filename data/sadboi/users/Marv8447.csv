The kind of man who treats women in his life like they are valuable as they are and they come with a certain amount of imperfection.  Instead you reinforced an attitude that, from the story you told, you've been fostering in him since he was a little boy: he is entitled to try and make every aspect of his life exactly to his preference.  No.  He of course can behave as he pleases but he is not the good guy here and he will continue to be the bad guy in all future stories until he values others pursuit of happiness as much as his own.

What he's failing to see is that this is about an extremely time and labor intensive homemade gift that you made for someone who is incredibly important to you during a time in which it is especially hard to keep up close relationships.  His insistence that this is just about cookies displays a complete lack of empathy, either intentionally out of pride (he doesn't sound like the type that's ever really apologized sincerely and is secretly proud of that fact), or unintentionally out of a sense of entitlement that simultaneously conveys a certain amount of contempt for things like baking, both of which are extremely unattractive qualities.

You're not going to be able to tell people what to do and not to do in their own homes i.e. whether or not they're allowed to be in the room with their kids during school hours, but the principal certainly didn't have to come to you like that.  If a parent really did report OPs son's behavior then it was the principal's job to set the boundary that the schools teachers and administration are responsible for directing and managing the classes, not the parents.

I'm a pretty understanding person, if she had apologized I could probably have overlooked it, because some people are just awkward AF.

She told all the teachers, lunch ladies, teachers aids, administration staff, janitors and anyone else affiliated with the school that they could treat me like their own child.  This resulted in a lot of genuinely warm memories from my childhood but also ridiculous things like me being forced to stay behind in the cafeteria while all of the other children dumped whatever excess food they didn't want to eat into the trash.

The world is prepared for eating disorders in teenagers but no one really talks about adult onset.  I've had those chest pains as well, I wish I could tell you what they are and not to worry but I'm currently trying to work up the courage to tell my doctor that my bulimia is flaring up again too, and I didn't even have a doctor when the ED first showed up.  It's scary because we know our body isn't as resilient any more and we're putting it through so much.  As far as the friend you're on the rocks with, just remember that bulimia can even be compared to self harm and we don't do this to ourselves because we're in a healthy frame of mind.  Your friend may never fully understand but please forgive yourself for maybe not handling everything perfectly while going through this.  Lastly, I know it sucks to feel like something is wrong with you, but getting a diagnosis and treatment shouldn't be a commentary on your flaws, instead it should be a road map to recovery and recognition of the struggle go through each day.  You're fighting that fight whether or not anyone else knows about it, and many people won't fully understand what it means, but many will and they won't see it as a weakness or something that's wrong with you, they will see the strength you have to have to live each day dealing with this.  After all, would we assume anybody with any other health condition was flawed for having it?

We each have the autonomy to give exactly as much of ourselves as we want in any relationship and not everyone loves in the same way.   Equally we each have the choice to accept the love offered or to seek something else, that's not to say that no one ever changes, just to say that it's no one's choice but the person who's doing the changing.

Have you genuinely tried to imagine what it would be like to be your new sibling?  To have lost all biological relatives, to not be able to rely on the normal people that most kids can rely on to take care of them and love them.  Your sibling lost their childhood before they met you, they never just had faith that someone would be there for them, that they would be taken care of.  They may have had to worry about whether or not they would have food to eat, or how to protect themselves, this world isn't designed for children to take care of themselves, so on top of the emotional impact that that would have had, they would have had a much harder time than an adult in the same situation.  Getting to spend time with you and your friends maybe the first chance at a real childhood that your sibling has had.  The way that you feel is entirely understandable, but it doesn't take into account anybody else in the situation, and how they feel.  That's what's making it harder for the rest of us to empathize with your point of view.  If this were a biological sibling, I think your post would have been  better received, I'm sure anyone who has had a sibling has said something like that to them at some point under similar circumstances.  But this is a person who has already possibly been through so much that it's heartbreaking to see your frustration with the situation be the reason that they endure anything else."

AmItheAsshole,fp9mp8q,t3_gbwo0y,1588429976.0,"Abso-friggin-lutely NTA.  I think everyone leading up to this point has made good comments about why this could be happening and how it's not your responsibility, I just wanted to add that I've noticed sometimes situations escalate because the two people having the conversation are actually having different conversations.  That's what this sounds like to me, you thought you were having a conversation about your lease, they thought you were having a conversation about their choices.  Just as a random example, I had a friend who firmly believed that almost everything that anyone did was meant to tell him something about his own behavior.  A lot of extra care was required in how you spoke to him, but it wasn't really possible to be careful enough, eventually he had to just come out with what he thought you were trying to say so that you could rebut it as having no relevence to the situation.  It may not seem like it but this is actually a pretty sensitive topic for a lot of people, people who are married, people who are single, people who already have children, people who are expecting their first, everyone has an insensitivity story from their pregnancies, not saying that this is one of those, but that might be the mindset this couple is in, expecting judgement.  In the end they may not even have an issue with you moving out, they may just be under the missassumption that you have negative feelings about their pregnancy, fostered by the feeling of being judged for their choices in general.  It's not your job to baby their feelings, especially after you already did such a good job celebrating with them, but if you want to keep the friendship it might be worth a little extra explanation that addresses any self-consciousness they may have."
AmItheAsshole,fp2nmyw,t3_gaw4yl,1588264834.0,"Honestly everyone's been a lil bit of an asshole at some point during this story.  You recognized that you were treating the two pregnancies differently and  saying that that is because of the circumstances is saying that you had some judgement about the differences and so felt justified in behaving as such.  She felt that judgment in a big way at a time when she was probably extra vulnerable.  Your eldest and her child are important members of your family currently and in retrospect it probably doesn't seem like there was any good reason to treat them as shameful or less special to you, hindsight being 20/20.  I think some slightly hurt feelings are pretty understandable.  We all make mistakes, and I'm so glad you took the opportunity to apologize, apologies are incredibly important in demonstrating to a person how you value them.  Additionally, you were sick, if I were your daughter this would also take some of the sting out of your handling of the situation, as many illnesses make everything else that much harder to deal with.  I will say though, it's possible for someone who is sick to hurt your feelings.  Intentionally or not, responsible or not, her feelings were hurt, and even if the responsibility is not yours, I imagine as her mother it hurts you to know she feels like she and her child are so much less valued because of circumstances.  She is never going to get those experiences back for her pregnancy.  We all deal with loss and disappiontment, this is one of hers.  All that said, she's being a huge asshole by treating it like something that can be fixed now if she punishes you enough.  It's done, it cannot be undone, what she chooses to do next will be the difference between her being a wonderful family member who strengthens her family bonds with forgiveness, or a brat that nobody respects and everyone resents, especially when her child is old enough to understand that they are being used as a tool to hurt their family and that that took precedence over them knowing and being loved by said family.  I would say see if she'll sit down and talk it out with you, sometimes we get in our own way with apologies and try and diminish what we did unintentionally because we feel so badly about it that we can't fully deal with admitting exactly how much hurt we feel responsible for.  If you're doing that, know that she's going to continue to push back on you until she feels like you understand the scope of her hurt.  In other words trying to deescalate the situation will escalate it, she may be under the impression that you don't feel like what happened was that big of a deal, and since they're her hurt feelings that implication is going to feel like a big overstep on your part.  If she won't allow a peaceful loving resolution from there, then it's all on her, and  down the road she's going to end up paying for it somehow.

AmItheAsshole,fozsqn6,t3_gaa8t7,1588196207.0,"YTA-not for feeling uncomfortable by the changes she's made but for (let's be honest) shaming her about them.  Asking her to dress normal is telling her that her current choices are abnormal and the request coupled with the embarrassment you feel could really hurt someone less secure in their choices than she sounds like, so good on her.  It sounds like you two are evolving separately, there's nothing wrong with your preferences, just like there's nothing wrong with hers, the problem is that you're embarrassed by her at this point, and I don't see that ending well for either of you.  You're the type of person who is comfortable standing out in socially mainstream ways, if at all, that doesn't sound like who your girlfriend is, so instead of making negative comments about her choices while she's doing things that make her feel good about herself, I urge you to evaluate if this is something you can handle, if so handle it in a way that lifts her up instead of tears her down."

He's under the impression that you are with him because you have no better options, and frankly you both deserve better than that.  His self-esteem and/or his desire to put in effort is so low that his comfort zone is to believe you believe you would find it impossible to find somebody better than him.  He then feels very threatened when you make positive changes in your life because he's wondering if he's going to be the next positive change you make.  While I think we all can relate to that fear, it is incredibly unhealthy to turn that fear into resentment and try and drag someone you love down the way he is.  Girl, it's on you how you want to proceed, this could be a real positive as an opportunity for you both to acknowledge your value in the relationship as well as your choice to be with him and by extension his value.
