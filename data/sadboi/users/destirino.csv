depression,fnfyjic,t3_g13d2r,1586918234.0,"Hi, please don't blame yourself.

My go-to metaphor for suicide is one I heard in a [spoken word poem](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/15gzr7/poem_depression_too_is_a_type_of_fire_by_taylor/). Essentially, it can be compared to someone jumping out of a burning building, not because the fear of falling isn't there but because the fear of the fire is worse. It's a more imminent danger.

I've fought some suicidal feelings before, and the best way I can describe it in my personal experience is that when all of my anxiety and depression makes me feel like I'm drowning, my brain likes to think that I'll stop feeling anxious and depressed if I die. Technically, that's probably true, but I'd also stop being alive. I wouldn't have the opportunity to get better. I wouldn't have the opportunity to feel better.

It's a whole big thing. *Let me say this once with love:* this is above your paygrade. There's nothing you could have done, and it wasn't your responsibility."

relationship_advice,fnawud1,t3_g0flm4,1586805228.0,"Develop a healthy dialogue with your daughter. Ask how that made her feel, and do your best to validate her feelings. In my opinion, your husbands actions have revolved around shaming your daughter. Shame doesn‚Äôt help anything. I can only imagine how mortified and embarrassed she must be. I strongly believe that she has nothing to feel guilty about. It‚Äôs natural and healthy to explore your body, and perhaps at 15 years old she‚Äôs earned the respect of a knock before entry. 

So primary goal, in my opinion, should be to mitigate the damage and trauma to your daughter. 

This may be something that you never see eye to eye on with your husband. You have time to figure that out. You only have a short time to help minimize your daughters trauma. 

If you haven‚Äôt already considered counselling, I would implore you to look into it. Whether it‚Äôs for your daughter, or your entire family. In my experience, anyone can benefit from counselling, and an objective and compassionate third party can make all the difference! (And you can do it from home!)

As for your husband, maybe sit down with some wine and get comfy while you discuss his feelings, your feelings, and your daughters feelings. Remind him that she‚Äôs a person first and his daughter second.

When doing my reading about cannabis to help with my own health concerns, I read about cases of people who get very ill after consuming considerable amounts of cannabis. This would be cases of people who chain-smoke joints or dab all day, but it's absolutely possible that you're smoking too much for your body. As with any medication that could be causing problems, it's best to wean off and try to go without, even just for a few days, but ideally as much as 30 days considering that's the generally accepted timeframe in which cannabis stays in your system. I also implore you to be open about this with your doctor. Obviously it's not the best time to go to the doc right now, so you can prepare by tracking your habits. I suggest keeping a ""symptom log"". It can help you understand how much you're actually dealing with and where to focus your energy ???? i hope that makes sense lol

I also recommend CBD. It's probably best to try going without cannabis products for a bit but I understand that you probably still need a way to manage your symptoms. You can smoke cbd flower or try cbd oil. It's a \*lot\* more subtle, but if THC is causing you problems  then CBD might be your next best bet.

I often just keep rescheduling things until I finally make it to the appointment. I‚Äôve found having appointments early in the mornings is also easiest for me,  because there‚Äôs less time to overthink.

Other than that, it‚Äôs important to have a nightly routine before bed and do your best to get enough sleep. Anxiety is exhausting. I usually get between 7-10 hours of sleep a night.

traumatoolbox,fi1oic0,t1_fi1j7wn,1582061707.0,"Hi! I also worry about the little things. It‚Äôs a symptom. I‚Äôm diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and General anxiety disorder, and I‚Äôve heard my mom describe it the same way. I don‚Äôt know your daughters personal experience but I can get you my favourite articles the give insight into how anxiety disorders feel. Your daughter most likely can‚Äôt just not worry about it. I recommend walking through things step-by-step with your daughter, acting essentially as a bounce board so she can voice her anxieties. For example, a task that might be easy for you, like going to school, is much more complicated with anxiety. Instead of being one step (1. Go to school) it might look more like this: 1. Get enough sleep. 2. Get ready fast enough. 3. What do normal people wear again? 4. Eat fast enough 5. Brush teeth 6. Wave of anxiety don‚Äôt cry don‚Äôt cry don‚Äôt cry 7. Panic attack and mom desperately trying to help, somehow making it worse

So, let your daughter talk out her anxiety. If her anxiety is disproportionate and uncontrollable, that‚Äôs the diagnostic criteria she had to meet to be diagnosed with a disorder. She‚Äôs not trying to be unreasonable, she‚Äôs just very symptomatic. Ask her questions, but avoid asking leading questions. So if she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll fail science this year‚Äù you may feel inclined to say ‚Äú*but you won‚Äôt, right?*‚Äù I would instead recommend asking ‚ÄúDo you have any reason to think you‚Äôll fail?‚Äù You‚Äôll be surprised how often there‚Äôs no evidence for her anxieties, but more importantly she‚Äôll start to realize that too. You‚Äôre helping her have those realizations on her own, or at least creating a space for healthy dialogue :)

I‚Äôm happy to share any of my experiences :) I hope your daughter finds relief.

I address self care as a way of living, which sounds super corny lol. I do my best to treat everyone with respect, and I deserve to show myself that respect too. I do my best to validate my own feelings, and when I can‚Äôt be kind to myself on the inside, I try to be kind to my body or my environment. Bubble baths, face masks, art, fresh air, books, movies, cat snuggs, eating three meals a day, seeing my doctor, sleeping the best I can, and forgiving myself for things. I carried a lot of guilt about the panic attacks for a long time. It was only in the last year that I realized that in that scenario my mom and I were both victims. My mom desperately wanted to help, and I desperately wanted help. Panic attacks are above our pay grade. There‚Äôs a reason people spend so long in school for this. Nobody expects either of you to know how to deal with this, but you‚Äôre also in this together. A big part of my self care moving home was to spend time with my mom, at my own pace. Sitting with her while she has coffee before work, brunch when she has the day off, and sitting with her while I eat dinner. It‚Äôs good for both of us. It also gives her a chance to see what I‚Äôve been working on. She‚Äôs more in tune with when I‚Äôm struggling and more understanding about what I feel and worry about moment to moment. It doesn‚Äôt seem like much but by knowing how your daughters anxiety functions is a game changer. The first time I realized my mom got it I almost cried.

This has gotten long but I‚Äôve also filled my bedroom according to my taste (weighted blanket included) and I‚Äôve added a lot of life! I open the blinds during the day to ensure I‚Äôm not hiding in a cave (I started by opening them just a little, even that can be stressful!!) and I added plants (with supplemental lighting because I get anxiety if my plants aren‚Äôt happy.) I also got a betta fish, in a heated and filtered tank which I gradually phased to live plants only :) the live plants act as a bit of a buffer if I‚Äôm having a lot of anxiety and don‚Äôt clean the tank for a little while, and make the fish extra happy! When I see that my cats, my plants, and my fish are visibly thriving, it helps me feel like I‚Äôm putting good into the world. There‚Äôs evidence that I‚Äôm more than my anxiety. It‚Äôs really cool :) that said, maybe your daughter is more into an ant farm or maybe a telescope. Fill her room with things that bring her joy :) also!! I do yoga at home with Yoga by Adriene on YouTube. I‚Äôd recommend starting with the 5 minute ones and let her feel it out as she goes. There‚Äôs a dog in most videos! His name is Benji. I love him. Anxiety also causes a lot of breathing disruption and muscle tension, especially around the neck and shoulders. That can be a good place to start :)"

I recently started counselling and find it really helpful, but everyone is different.

If you teach your daughter to take care of herself, identify her needs and see to them, and be kind to herself. This panic is not her fault. It‚Äôs happening to her and it‚Äôs not her fault. She can get through it.
