PublicFreakout,fr2jigr,t1_fr11l6m,1589838391.0,Some may say it’s a necessity
yourmomshousepodcast,fr2ic5j,t3_gm3yow,1589837792.0,This is my new background. Thank you.
SuicideWatch,fqtvp8w,t3_gksxyu,1589647021.0,"To a degree. You’re body physically does get addicted to many drugs, very much including alcohol. Your body gets to a point where you will die without proper treatment if you just stop taking them. It does seem like most people do start for the escape. Once you’re in, you’re in with too many drugs though."
GarageBand,fqtv2hp,t1_fqtefvg,1589646675.0,"Watch some videos, read some books, play around with the program every chance you get. If you’ve been using GarageBand for some time you’ll be able to pick it up pretty well. It’s similar basics with a lot more control. The IU for GB is pretty sweet, but that’s because of its limitations so that will take some getting used to. Don’t go all in, look for shit in the program you’re already familiar with and go from there. If you want to take production seriously, it’s worth the jump!"
GarageBand,fqtuklq,t1_fqtebxt,1589646399.0,"I’m not sure about logic, but with ableton live (which I hear are pretty similar for the most part) it’s far more complex and in depth. Pretty much anything can be automated, which in itself is a huge advantage. There aren’t weird bugs that cause the program to crash because you pressed the wrong icon and the wrong time. You have far more control over everything. It’s a huge difference. 

All that being said, I use GarageBand because I’m broke af and fell in love with it because of its simplicity (it’s also where I started). As much as I do miss using Ableton, it’s kind of nice having something a little more basic as this all has levelled back into being just a hobby for me. If you want to take this seriously and don’t want to just be able to make music, but learn more about how everything works and understand the mechanics behind it (which will give you a huge leap forward), leave GarageBand behind. If you just want to have a shitload of fun making music, GarageBand is definitely where it’s at."
PublicFreakout,fqrxsac,t1_fqronpo,1589594171.0,You can’t act as the aggressor then complain when it gets too much for you. You can’t get everything your way. It’s pretty simple. Life’s hard. Grow up.
PublicFreakout,fqrxn3e,t1_fqronpo,1589594083.0,"What relationship though? Why would she try to use force to stop a complete stranger from singing by pushing him back and attempting to take his instrument? Look at things objectively and you’ll see how ridiculous you sound. Should he have slapped her being in the right in pushing her away? Probably not. Did she deserve it, probably."

PublicFreakout,fqhhc3z,t1_fqgoxa3,1589377006.0,I don’t think it’s so much of a black thing as a poor thing. The people I know (that I can think of atm) who are willing to fight anytime at a moment’s notice all grew up in pretty shitty homes where they had basically nothing (or have daddy issues).

There’s something I’ve found out, getting better for some people is so much goddamn work. It really is. Unfortunately, the people that need it can’t do it alone, and the worst part is that you really have to want it. You can get better, it’s very possible. It’s different for everyone but a combination of the right therapy, meds, community, and a shitload of effort things can change. I’ve seen it, I’ve kind of done it, but in the end I think I just don’t want it bad enough. It’s something you have to settle on, being in the middle is frustrating for everyone. That being said, it takes a long ass time and continual monitoring. I’ve seen some pretty fucked up people come back and it’s amazing."

People used to get away with a lot in the name of disciplining their kids. I have the scars to prove it."
PublicFreakout,fpu9yrn,t1_fpu73mf,1588907923.0,The problem with that is being able to see the difference between discipline and taking out your problems on an innocent kid. Most people who were hit and condone hitting probably didn’t have to deal with a broken parent. Those lines are often blurred to the outside world.

Keep in mind it’s pre-recorded, but if you save the file you can always alter the recorded movement to match what you need. I hope this is helpful to someone.
