They can be in such a state of sadness and helplessness that they just want to quit everything in their life, the best way to help is be there, help them find small good things that keep them happy
They can feel constantly bored and like theres nothing really worth living for, if so keep them busy and help them find things they like 
They can be in such a bad situation that they feel like the only way out is death, show support and be there
