As for why something get to be more trendy than another thing , it's related to the thing itself the bridge was dark comedy that made people laugh , as for why we don't have good things about the country it's because many who can post stuff like that didn't like the political views here and started another sub

Isekai,fqlie8a,t3_gjekwy,1589458912.0,"Not sure about my luck part I can't tell if my luck is good or bad but I will answer for best case and worse case

Best case: It's a middle ages/early industrial setting where technology is just starting to appear while still not able to create deadly war machines 

What I will find myself in: a mechanic(or whatever that world calls a small inventor)/blacksmith(but only if I couldn't find a blacksmith that can make a machine peace right nearby) and a woodcutter/builder if I had time and needed extra money,then with the money from the small time machines I settle down in a mountain estate in the middle of nowhere so no one can snoop on me ,try to build something modren-ish for self defense and find wife,I will be the weird eccentric inventor that will eventually become a teacher or a professor who will end up dying in a war as he refused to let the battle reach his hometown and family , he may not have done a lot while alive but in his death he will be remembered as the crazy berserker who somehow killed more than he should have been able to



Worst scenario: a fantasy early middle ages world where science is unheard of ,magic replace technology ,hoards of monsters and many demon lords everywhere , deception and crime are rampant,natural disasters are a common occurrence,governed by twisted gods who punish you for trivial matters and a place where birthright rules supreme

What I will do: try to develop my abilities in every field , a jock of all traits master of non is a better option than doing only one thing , I will become a mercenary/adventurer to have the freedom of movement ,I will be the guy that gets both a contract with a demon and the oaths of a holy man while hiding both till a need arises ,live life trying to do good when I can and not care when I can't ,end up as a big shot assistant somewhere down the line ,use my abilities to always escape before I am killed while the other party is trying to reach the boss and from there travel to a faraway different corner of the world and start again , probably will end up dying by the hands of the hero after I rebel against all and try to establish a fair just safe atheist land as I will be branded as a traitor ,hopefully before my death I would have given the biggest villain a weapon to challenge the gods and told him/her about their weakness"
