I think he was in the right to be a bit upset about the sex incident...however,  i think he's being irrational by leaving and ignoring you. Sounds like he has issues of his own to deal with"

quebeccity,f8coh4j,t3_e07po5,1574465002.0,"many people in quebec speak both french and english very well! Wherever it is you may go, im sure your host family would be glad to help you with french. People will likely adjust to your needs. I personally love quebec city, I attended a cÃ©gep (just moved here during summer) and I'm sure Quebec highschool will benefit you greatly. You will learn many things and acquire many unforgettable experiences as an exchange student. Best of luck!"
