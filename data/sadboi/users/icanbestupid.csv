Suicide is selfish because it comes from a viewpoint solely focused on the self. When someone is hopeless, depressed, or in pain they are completely focused on their own situation.

Meditation,epzz6t8,t1_epz7z9s,1559675412.0,"One thing that has completely changed my world is voicing a positive observation. So if I am looking out the window and only see the side of an ugly home with an unkept lawn I would look for something appealing.  Anything. ""I like how the vine climbs the side of the house"". It's awesome how from there I start to notice even more beautiful and complex things. It will go from ""there is a shadow on the house"" to ""wow, the sun casts a pinkish tint on that column"".  Allow yourself to be impressed and you will be impressed with what our world has to offer."

Nature is so freaking rejuvenating to me. I need it. I like to think a breeze is God's reminder for me to relax. ""*tranquillo*"""

ADHD,epz58jw,t3_bwi9um,1559658664.0,"I come home from work and feel drained. DRAINED. My job is not hard, I love what I do, and there is no physical labor. I never thought that maybe I'm so drained because I have to hold in basically every emotion possible. I can't just get up every now and then to dance lol or start beatboxing."
