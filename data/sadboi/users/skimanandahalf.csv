Very interesting substance, definitely going to try again in the future."

CongratsLikeImFive,fnb4g1a,t3_g0p8dy,1586809039.0,"That is really good progress. I have the utmost fate that you will keep making progress, in whatever form that takes.

I also did the ""blade graze"" when I stopped self-harming. It was really hard to find a replacement when my whole world was collapsing around me and it felt like the only way out. It was really hard and there is always that moment of hesitation, but I started trying to view that as a sign of progress; I do, and did, have control. 

If you need anything during this process, I can try to help as much as my limited knowledge will allow me."
CongratsLikeImFive,fnb3hs5,t1_fnazdtd,1586808565.0,I'm glad. Keep on keeping on! if you ever need anything my DMs are open.

Also, I personally don't believe that doing lazy things (even a lot) makes you a lazy person. You're a great person that does lazy things sometimes, which is okay :)
