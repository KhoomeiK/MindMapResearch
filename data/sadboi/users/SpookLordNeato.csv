chess,fnw6dfi,t3_g3v7gc,1587312336.0,"I was in marching band throughout highschool and my god why does it matter to so many people whether or not their activities constitute as a “sport”. Personally I think chess does cover aspects of sports in the sense that there is a competition and a winner between players, but without real physical exertion it seems to be more of a “game” than a sport. I bring up marching band because football kids love to trash on band kids for band “not being a sport”, and band kids love to get overly defensive of their synchronized walking, but it’s a competitive athletic activity regardless of it’s arbitrary title, so who cares whether it’s a “sport”, a “game”, or a “performing art”. In the end it doesn’t matter and makes no impact on the activity itself."

Recently I’ve been going to sleep early using melatonin and getting up as early as 6am and it has made me into a morning person. Getting up and enjoying my coffee for an hour or two before the day REALLY starts is one of my favorite times now. It also gives me time to catch up on anything I didn’t do the day before and get ready for the day.

EscapefromTarkov,firktmb,t1_firk238,1582666285.0,"Right on. In addition, “sound traps” like hunt:showdown could also be a cool way to spice up the gameplay. Right now the only way to hear a player from a distance is gunshots and footsteps for the most part. However if things like broken glass or birds or motion-activated alarms or anything like that were implemented it could give an edge to players who move slowly and carefully. They’re sort of starting this already with the alarm on reserve, but that’s not really a “trap”. It also makes the environment as much of an opponent as other pmc’s, which ties into the whole mutant and supernatural idea. Obviously some people want pure hardcore pvp action, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but personally I would love if tarkov took it’s player versus enemy and player versus environment gameplay elements to the next level rather than focusing mostly on pvp."

It’s just intense and some people have no way to cope with things they don’t understand without relating it to spirituality or something “higher” like religion or god. It’s exactly what ancient people did to explain the natural phenomenon and world around them before we developed tools to understand exactly what was happening. I think psychedelics are the same way. There is a scientific or biological basis for everything that goes on during a trip, we just don’t know how to explain it or describe it so we relate it to spirituality or something above us on a different plane of existence. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this necessarily but some people are very adamant that psychs are proof of god and some higher plane when it could very well be rooted in yet-to-be-discovered biology and science. But my viewpoints are just a testament to how differently psychs affect people and how we all handle/cope with trips differently."

Without mass media and mobile technology we would be blissfully ignorant to most of the world’s tragedies and not have bad thoughts about them, because we just straight up wouldn’t know. Unless you are directly affected by climate change (example: Australian fires) or political processes then there is no use in worrying or stressing over them. It’s so far removed from most of our daily lives. Obviously we all have a part to play in society, and we as a society should take responsibility for climate change and participate in politics, but it’s really not worth excessive stress and depression on an individual level unless it is absolutely directly affecting you."

We have a big stone quarry area that has a one chunk hole dug out to bedrock with a crane to hoist materials out, as well as stockpiles of stone/ore/etc and carts for transport to a dock with loading barges. Most of it is basically useless and just for show, but it’s one of my favorite builds."
