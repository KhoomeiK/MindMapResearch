longhair,ff314r2,t1_ff2z7ai,1579530891.0,"Thank you! Depending on your hair length you could get these:
[bonnet 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077D7DW21/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_LJBjEb592D3SH)

[bonnet 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y7VR1XM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_BKBjEbQHQ33ZH)

Or take a satin pillowcase, and turn it inside out, place your hair inside (it'll kind of look like a nun's habit), and then secure the base of the cap (the excess fabric at your hairline at the nape of your neck with a scrunchie). My hair is to the point that I have to do this because the caps listed above won't fit my hair comfortably."
longhair,ff1yhek,t1_ff1q690,1579489094.0,"Hey! I'm not sure if we have the same hair type (I have curly hair) but this is what I do:

-wash my hair every 3 to 4 days: 
When I wash my hair I do a hot oil treatment. Which is when I put unrefined coconut oil on my hair /scalp and then I put a disposable plastic shower cap on my head for 30 minutes to 3 hours. My body heat heats up the oil. No microwaving required 😁

I then wash my hair with garnier fructis aloe shampoo.
And then I dry my hair with a few cotton t shirts. I don't use towels on my hair, I just do a few t-shirt turbans every 10 to 15 minutes.

I let my hair air dry for 20 or so minutes. And then I use my soft bonnet dryer. I have very thick/long hair and so without it my hair would take awhile to dry. Especially since it's currently winter, I can't go out in the sun for 3 hours not properly covered.

After I get my hair 70 to 85 % dry. I lightly spray my hair/scalp with rosewater and then I  moisturize my hair/scalp with JBCO (argan oil mix). 

Each day after I wake up I repeat the moisture routine listed above. A little oil goes a long way.

I also massage my scalp for 20 to 45 min daily. This helps facilitate blood flow and nutrients to my scalp, which makes my hair grow faster. I also try to drink alot of water and eat healthy. 

If your prone to stress induced hair loss, try to maintain your stress level.


Extra tips:
-sleep with a satin pillowcase and satin cap
- I only use scrunchies because they are gentle and protective
-I avoid tight hairstyles"

Dreadlocks,fb7pbbr,t3_ebwozc,1576596196.0,"Sleep with a satin pillow case and head scarf. Wash your hair every 4 to 6 days. Only use scrunchies as hair ties (none of those tiny black ties because those will damage your hair). Moisturize ur scalp and locs every 1 to 3 days with rosewater (heritage brand) and jbco. Your moisturizing schedule will depend on your particular hair/scalp. Listen to what your hair and scalp need. There are many different types of jbco, pick the one that is best for your hair. Wait at least 2 months before tightening your locs. If you don't you can damage your locs. Avoid wax and any other ""locking"" agent. Your hair is curly so it can lock without those kind of aids. Make sure you are doing a scalp massage every day for 10 to 20 minutes. This revitalizes your scalp by promoting blood flow which in turn makes your hair grow faster. Drink water and maintain your stress level. Make sure you're eating a good balanced diet. Poor health can reflect in your hair and scalp. And before each wash I like to do a hot oil treatment (unrefined coconut oil ) on my hair and scalp and then I put a plastic shower cap on my head for 30 min to 2 hours. Then I wash my hair with garnier fructis aloe vera shampoo. For drying, I use a cotton tshirt as a turban for 10 minutes and then I replace the wet one with a dry one. I then let my hair air dry for a bit, and then use a soft bonnet dryer to dry my hair. My hair is tailbone length and it's super thick so I need the soft bonnet dryer. Don't dye your locs because u can risk breakage and lastly don't do line ups on your hairline because the hairs that the barber shapes up are vital for your front locs. Good luck 😁"
mentalillness,fb5q2wn,t3_ebhyvw,1576532254.0,"I would tell your doctor what's been happening.  You could say something like "" Ever since I've been on this medication I've been having nightmares about [insert traumatic events.]"" Honesty to a degree can facilitate a faster recovery in my opinion. But if you feel you can't trust this doctor I think you should find a new provider if possible. Good luck 💕"
Hirsutism,fb43lk7,t3_e1dft9,1576500645.0,"You should go to the doctor so they can determine if it's PCOS or your genetics. Your doctor should refer you to an endocrinologist.
