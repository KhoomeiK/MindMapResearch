lawofattraction,fo757ke,t1_fo72xyk,1587572455.0,"Even abraham hicks and Neville Goddard teaches about vibration and If someone is acting a certain way towards you it's because of your vibration. Meaning that you can change your vibration, and through changing your vibration you can change anything in your reality. It's not voodoo or mind control. It's vibration. I've been studying this concept for many years with the help of several loa teachers. I just haven't learned to master it yet. Whether you're aware of it or not, you're ""controlling"" people all the time through your vibration. For example, if someone is being passive aggressive towards you, on an unconscious level you created that. But also, if another person treats you with respect, you created that through your vibration as well. We are constantly ""controlling"" others whether we're aware of it or not"

Also, make sure you don't eat anything 3 hours before bed. Many doctors recommend making sure you do that. I hope that helps. 

Edit: also it sounds like you might  be stressing yourself over it too much. I weighed 147 pounds a few weeks ago and I now weigh 138 just from following the advice above. I've noticed that on days where I don't really try that hard are days when I lose weight the quickest. Maybe it's a mind thing. Lots of stress may make us gain more weight"
