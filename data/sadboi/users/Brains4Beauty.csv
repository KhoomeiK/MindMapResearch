90DayFiance,fqzg2sl,t3_glgnrd,1589766622.0,Wait I thought she could speak English? Did she not talk English to him on the app? Or was it auto translated or something?
90DayFiance,fqzg0ae,t1_fqzfyvr,1589766580.0,The story is so thin otherwise.
90DayFiance,fqzfz1n,t3_glgnrd,1589766560.0,I have hardly ever seen anything more awkward than David and Lana meeting.
90DayFiance,fqzfqhn,t1_fqzf9hu,1589766422.0,Same as Lana!
90DayFiance,fqzfp7z,t1_fqzfdh9,1589766403.0,I think you‚Äôre right.  Before this one started there was a ‚Äúthree more to go‚Äù thing

Youniqueamua,fqlrf97,t3_giivug,1589464636.0,But....don‚Äôt you have $99 on a credit card or something? You tel others it‚Äôs ok to use their last $99 to join but you won‚Äôt do it yourself?
Youniqueamua,fqlr7xi,t3_gikh1a,1589464523.0,Looks like their skincare doesn‚Äôt work very well
AmItheAsshole,fqbz8uy,t3_ghv36t,1589246877.0,Yta and you wouldn‚Äôt like it having to clear that hair ball out of the drain.  Sounds like she just forgot.  Sheesh
AmItheAsshole,fqazada,t3_ghlwrx,1589227856.0,"ESH, you guys don‚Äôt have time for a dog. You need to responsibly rehome him. Trust me, I get it, I have two dogs myself.  But I have the time for them.  You don‚Äôt and your girlfriend especially is going to resent him especially when she‚Äôs home with a baby.  A misbehaving dog is no good for anyone.  He needs to be with people who will train him and take care of him."
90DayFiance,fq88o1m,t3_gh0qne,1589160738.0,Damn he‚Äôs cold.  She‚Äôs better off anyways.

90DayFiance,fq7zwmk,t3_gh0qne,1589155649.0,Ash is such a pussy. Also I‚Äôm surprised he can actually make a living as a ‚Äúcoach‚Äù as his advice is shit.
90DayFiance,fq7zpzt,t1_fq7znvn,1589155540.0,Yes not what I expected!
MadeMeSmile,fq3xfx1,t3_ggk0kp,1589071396.0,Omg this kid! Cutest thing I have seen in a while!
AmItheAsshole,fq3x0b8,t3_ggmc1h,1589071255.0,"NTA.  Your brother is a dick.  If you‚Äôre close with your SIL at all, you should advise her to get a lawyer and start court proceedings, so she can get child support for her kids, as your brother does not seem like a stand up guy who is going to do right by them (sorry)."
AmItheAsshole,fpwcnu9,t3_gftzoq,1588961113.0,"You‚Äôre NTA at all.  Sounds like grandma was smart too, as she specifically mentioned the amounts she wanted to give your mom and the others. Let them try and fight it legally, sounds like it was iron clad."
AmItheAsshole,fps3jyf,t3_gf5hgj,1588866868.0,NTA.  If that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs going to do then you had better make plans for your son. If she won‚Äôt change her mind I‚Äôd also rethink this relationship.
AmItheAsshole,fps1nun,t3_gf20d6,1588865978.0,NTA.  Your husband was for running out and buying something you would both be using every day without any opinion from you.   Now it seems he doesn‚Äôt like his purchase.  He doesn‚Äôt then get to take the couch from you.
AmItheAsshole,fpkftet,t3_gdnxr6,1588693908.0,"NTA.  It‚Äôs a sad situation for everyone, but I believe if you can still pay you should (plus as you said you would be screwing over a family).  My building has offered options for people who have lost their jobs, but it also says in the notices they have to work on repayment options as well (meaning if they can‚Äôt pay rent now fine but eventually they will have to)."
AmItheAsshole,fpkefhv,t3_gdihtr,1588693183.0,"NTA. Your wife is also kind of an A as well for not backing you up! I think this is pretty much common sense, ‚Äúnot knowing about internet privacy‚Äù is bull especially at your daughter‚Äôs age.  I think maybe you ease back into the Internet use, and keep the roblox for last, until she can prove to you she is trustworthy again. Wishing your wife would back you up more tho üòê"

ChoosingBeggars,fp7bv1u,t3_gbphln,1588367705.0,Bleh.  What a jerk. Having a ‚Äúmom and dad‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they are good people.

HumansBeingBros,foss92j,t3_g9bu4x,1588036986.0,Awesome dude.  My parents‚Äô neighbour has been making his son bring their bins in and out every week for about the last year.  My dad died in March and now I‚Äôm really grateful that his son is doing this for my mom. She pays him $5 a week but still.  I think the neighbour made him do it anyways. üôÇ
90DayFiance,fosrysm,t3_g92v7k,1588036818.0,Likely they will say he should self isolate when he gets out.  And he should to make sure he doesn‚Äôt pass it on.
90DayFiance,fosrujk,t3_g92v7k,1588036751.0,Wow the photoshop in that window silhouette pic
90DayFiance,fosroau,t3_g92v7k,1588036647.0,I type court transcripts in Ontario and a lot of prisoners are applying for bail reviews to try to get out.  It‚Äôs just as bad as being in the long term care homes where it just spreads like wild fire.
90DayFiance,fosrbll,t3_g92v7k,1588036438.0,Ok this show is all nice and feel good but bring on the ‚Äúwhat now‚Äù drama coming next!!

90DayFiance,fop7gcf,t1_fop78wx,1587954780.0,Sometimes the editing is fishy on this show but I think so too.  How else would she have gotten Ed‚Äôs number to text him?
90DayFiance,fop7a8r,t1_fop78q0,1587954669.0,It‚Äôs possible. Random cats would roam our resort in Cuba.
