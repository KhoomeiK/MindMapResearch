AskAChristian,fonzqpk,t1_fontbfn,1587929674.0,"Question... so self preservation is not fear... agree... so a church saying they need so many people to carry a gun and have a permit to have a church, that‚Äôs fear right? The very pastor that says ppl wearing mask and cleaning their groceries are living in fear and not faith... is the same man that says they need ppl to carry guns because the churches are u see attack. That would be considered fear right. It‚Äôs like it just hit me when you said that... how hypocritical what he has said is. THAT MOMENT God opens your eyes!!!"

AskAChristian,fontg7n,t1_fonqzne,1587926126.0,"Oh I never hold grudges or even get mad TBH... I just worry about baby Christians that hear this and start feeling guilt when they have a natural emotion. That is not the first thing he has said that made me feel like babies could take it wrong and lose faith. It was Easter (so a lot of Christians that normally don‚Äôt go) He made a statement how when you give yourself completely to God that your life changes... depression, anxiety etc etc gets lifted. That‚Äôs not true at all... not even a little. Depression is my thorn in my side. I take meds but I still suffer and probably 5 out of 7 days I think about death and how great it would be. God has given me strength and carries me through it, but it‚Äôs still there. So if someone is out there listening to this, desperate to get over anxiety or depression and it doesn‚Äôt happen. That could be the thing that makes them say ‚ÄúI knew God was too good to be true etc‚Äù The world is so different and more and more youth can get answers from science. God starts to seem more and more like a fairy tale. I was always VERY honest with my kids. We prayed for strength and peace and acceptance for HIS will... not really healing etc... because even if loss or sickness needs to happen to help us grow or to be able to help others.. then it needed to be. That‚Äôs why depression is something I carry and I know it has allowed me to help many others. I have tried to talk to my pastor about things, but I think his pride would never allow him to even consider what he says could be taken wrong. I think sometimes he forgets church isn‚Äôt just filled with rooted Christians. It has some that threw their seeds on rock and some in weeds etc etc... so they need to be witnessed too different than someone that knows that a Christian suffers with everything in life too... that tithing does NOT mean your finances will be great, that it‚Äôs ok to be afraid, and that being afraid and living in fear are two different things. He sent a group message to about 20ppl to have choir practice... on a stage.... one of the ladies is 92 years old. To me that is not ok!!! My mom has cancer and asthma, my son has asthma and many other issues. It just makes me feel he doesn‚Äôt take his sheep into consideration and when you say something, you are made to feel like your faith is not strong enough. I live in country so we only have a pastor and a bunch of ppl that will do whatever he says and not even question. So I just feel it‚Äôs my time to go. Also, I come here to talk because I would NEVER tell a soul how I feel except him."
AskAChristian,fonqnzi,t1_fonmpke,1587924578.0,"That was a really good read! I couldn‚Äôt agree more TBH!!! When my pastor made a comment about me wearing a mask and saying he wouldn‚Äôt wear one because he has enough faith... I said ‚Äú Oh trust me, I have NO FEAR or death, I have fear of being the reason someone loses a loved one... that‚Äôs what I fear‚Äù needless to say, I will be in search of a new church. I don‚Äôt feel like God would ever make me feel guilty or kinda poke me for doing what is right by others."

We decided to walk and it was SO HOT!!! I LOVE OKW... it‚Äôs in my top 5 resorts :) hope you enjoy :) I remember my first time going from value to deluxe. Aaahhhhhh"
WaltDisneyWorld,eyevrc5,t1_eyeuq3m,1567039702.0,"I bet!!! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm glad we are there during... May close a day or two, but usually takes a week for ppl to come back"
WaltDisneyWorld,eyevmnp,t1_eyev1ji,1567039653.0,Probably because it‚Äôs a screen shot my friend sent me... I guess
SuicideWatch,eyevi8b,t3_cwio6u,1567039604.0,"This is very similar to my sons story. His dad was a hot mess, I would take up and usually get it in the end. Never physical just verbal and threats. I ended up leaving him and he got help and is now good. But the damage was done.
 
He was an actor and had done a lot of national commercials esp NERF  and a lot 
Of indie films... did a movie with Kevin Durand and he was always lead character. Just signed with Mitchell Gossett and CESD.  He was moving to LA in Feb. He graduated at 16 and was VERY smart and VErY charismatic... he used comedy to hide his awkwardness.

Waiting to move to LA I wanted him to get an actual job to understand what working for a wage, vs $3k a day for Nerf, felt like because that would be what he would have to do
While auditioning. 

He couldn‚Äôt make it... he was on Accutane and it has serious side effects, and some dumb ass grown men messing with a 17 year old finally wore him down. 

Two weeks from his 18th bday... October 20th 2016... he left me. I really hope you can work this out. You sound like an amazing spirit with so much to offer!!!"
WaltDisneyWorld,eyer14f,t1_eyeqn23,1567037758.0,"I really like it there! It‚Äôs really spread out and that makes it nice and quiet :) I really like it there because all the other ones have one bed and a sleeper sofa, and they have two beds!!! There are a couple I have not stayed at yet... but from my experience they have been the only one. The ferry is nice to Disney Springs too!! Is that yalls home or just where you chose?"
WaltDisneyWorld,eyeqjio,t1_eyei90c,1567037553.0,Thanks so much!!! Do you have a blog or anything. I would love to see your review if you share :)

See that you guys now have a mega generator after what had happened. I live near Beaumont, we lost our home and everything in Harvey. Hurricanes stink, but where I live we are able to evacuate. I always pray for you guys, y‚Äôall really can‚Äôt leave like we can. So happy for you all!"

WaltDisneyWorld,eyeev11,t1_eyee6js,1567032804.0,Same! Our flight lands at around 2 Sunday. So I am excited it has moved back. Originally they said Sunday. I‚Äôm going to go live...one more thing I can say I have done at disney üòÇ
Mediums,ey4hsy1,t1_ey4hh2s,1566792793.0,"Thanks. It has been ruff. However, seeing a GREAT medium saved my life. He told me things that were so personal and even if you googled my son... you would not have know. When I went I was a skeptic... so I payed with a visa gift card, and gave my moms name. When we got there he would not really let us talk much... only when he would ask. He did not want us to influence the reading. I paid for two hours, but it went on for 4... and he did not charge :) I really hope he knows he actually saved my life. Because my PTSD had me bad and I was about to end my own life. I hope all these mediums in here really know what a blessing they are to people. Also, not to sound odd, but my son had started acting so that‚Äôs why the whole google comment. Because esp at that time he had just done a movie with Kevin Durand and was easily googled. He has an IMDB etc... so I wanted to be nameless to him."
Mediums,ey43psr,t1_ey4203h,1566780978.0,"I wanted to know why he had passed the way he did. By choice... we were very close and he never not once let me know he was in that state of mind. He was on Accutane for acne (suicide is bad with this... med is black boxed) so we talked about it. The night before he passed I even asked... he laughed at me and we then watched a few Archer episodes then I went to bed. I woke up... really did not want to go to gym, but forced myself to... he had just woke up... one of the ONLY times in his 17 (two weeks to 18) years I did not hug him goodbye. While at gym.... I felt it... I was in the middle of my workout... I started to call and no answer... I get home and his music is blaring and I hear a voice LOUD say DONT GO IN... so I screamed for him and no answer.. I made his dad come home... I went all over property looking for him yelling... and I hear his dad screaming no... no... why son why.... then he yells call 911... and that was it. He had shot himself. He was a hilarious fun loving person... it was so unexpected from everyone. So when I got the note... it was very very odd... he started it with ‚ÄúSpoiler Alert... mom if your reading this do not go in the bathroom, get dad...‚Äù then it was basically making jokes and said he loved us. That was it. There is more to story but that‚Äôs the short version. I just wanted to know why... why he did it"

Have to read if so!!!"

Soooo angry!!"
Mediums,ey21qlw,t1_ey1xu7o,1566720320.0,"I love this!!! I have many stories as well. I could go on for days, but I just want to really see him again. It was real, I know it was... dreams are nothing like this. I just feel as though he has done what he needed to, and now I can hear him say stuff like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need that, I‚Äôm always here and you know it, just listen and feel, know and see‚Äù I second guess myself so much, that must be frustrating when he is communicating and here I am saying ok... then saying weeeelllll that‚Äôs probably all in my head. Yet I know... I KNOW... I am not the same person I was. It‚Äôs like having bad vision all your life, then getting a pair of glasses. I can see now. It‚Äôs like his passing woke me up. He was awake the whole time too. He is an amazing soul... very special. He taught me stuff his whole life... a child... teaching me about life. It was crazy. He still does üòÇ I‚Äôm going to check out your story for
Sure"
Mediums,ey0fkqw,t1_ey0eb6j,1566678381.0,"Thanks so much!! I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss! It really sucks. I had all these plans of a future, grandkids, etc. now that will never happen. I accept that now, but it took me a while to get here. Never in his 17 (two weeks from 18) life did I believe this would really happen. I had a fear, but never believed.  One day we shall all be together, but until my work
Here is done... I will continue to grow and be the best me I can. I feel like his life and death will help others. I have already had ppl brought into my life from this. It‚Äôs amazing how something so tragic can actually bloom beauty"
