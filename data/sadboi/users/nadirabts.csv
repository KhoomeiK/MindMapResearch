exmuslim,foyxsao,t3_ga7tw4,1588181161.0,was it not a year or two ago when i saw on twitter that people were saying bitmojis are haram because a man might get “turned on” and masturbate? lmfao so i’m not surprised about this
exmuslim,fh3yhoz,t3_f1a5oq,1581273526.0,i also have had the same thoughts as you and could not wrap my head around it. you mean to tell ME if i listen to music and have sex before marriage imma be in the same hell that murderers and rapists go to? lmfaooo as if
Anxiety,fguu2r4,t3_f0jvzy,1581129456.0,congrats!! it took me 3 times to pass. can you believe i actually “passed” the first time but the instructor said i was “too nervous” and failed me? i didn’t even know that was a thing...
aldi,fgcr6di,t1_fgcmh8r,1580675499.0,flaming hot “cheetos” yes!!! lol. next time i plan on using doritos
exmuslim,fg6yepv,t3_ex7ixz,1580579762.0,well i’ve been a kpop fan since 2013 and the reason i was so obsessed with music/kpop/social media was because all of those things were my escape. i’ve personally met amazing people on the internet because of kpop. if it wasn’t for kpop distracting me from my life problems back then i didn’t know what i would’ve done. now that i’m way older i’m not into it as much but i will always appreciate the music genre.
childfree,ffw2rcr,t3_ev9whx,1580281821.0,i’m 22 right now and i can’t sleep for more than 6-7 hours. i work 2 jobs and i’m the oldest of 6 kids so besides working and going to school my days also consist of being a maid/chef/babysitter/tutor so that post is far from accurate
insanepeoplefacebook,ffvtk1v,t1_ffvtdwy,1580272846.0,LOL i’ve been a part of the muslim community for 20+ years trust me i’ve seen and heard it all
insanepeoplefacebook,ffvs4hz,t3_ev8npv,1580271693.0,this sounds like a lot of extremist muslim men or just extremist men that believe in any religion such as christianity etc etc. i hear about people that hold these types of insane views in the muslim community all the time...
exmuslim,ffvrete,t3_evdpdz,1580271139.0,"lol i’ve made plenty of du’aas that “came true” that were mainly coincidences or things i worked hard to achieve. some of them include praying that i get my phone back (my mom would always take my phone away for no reason when i was younger), praying that i get my license (passed with flying colors), praying that i get the job i applied for etc etc! looking back i think it’s funny tbh"
exmuslim,ffugjv5,t3_ev5oev,1580241491.0,please go to that school and do what makes you happy! if your own brother goes to that university as well then it’s very hypocritical and sexist of your parents to not let you go. your parents didn’t put all the work in to get a full ride scholarship; you did! good luck ❤️
exmuslim,ffr81nj,t1_ffq8z5d,1580152472.0,"https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/08/middleeast/hajj-sexual-abuse-asequals-iwd-intl/index.html

here’s one of many sources i have read in the past. there was actually a whole #MosqueMeToo movement on Twitter in 2018. From what I’ve read the women try to tell the police that are there but #1 a lot of them don’t speak fluent Arabic so the police won’t understand and #2 most of the police don’t care to begin with. It makes me really sad"
exmuslim,ffol4mw,t1_ffokf3s,1580078809.0,yes which is why i said i won’t group all Muslims into this generalization however that wasn’t the first ignorant tweet I saw and it won’t be the last. as a matter of fact i could go tell my own parents rn that he died and they would tell me “who cares he ain’t muslim” so there’s that.
exmuslim,ffndyby,t3_eu78si,1580064674.0,the part where the book says women in the west are more likely to be sexually assaulted blows my mind because a while ago i was reading stories of women who have been sexually assaulted during hajj/umrah— right in front of the kabbah.
exmuslim,fffbgdq,t3_etaw5w,1579880277.0,i’ve never been drunk in my entire life because i’m usually the responsible person taking care of others but if i were to drink alcohol it would have to be in moderation. i don’t like not being in control of myself so a drink or two at a time would be as far as i would go.
exmuslim,ffcz4mn,t3_esx819,1579810247.0,i want to go to their concert in chicago! but anyways i hope everything works out and you have fun.
exmuslim,ff7l602,t3_es0lfr,1579652164.0,she wants to make islam sound really good to the public when it’s not.

exmuslim,fc2gqg6,t3_efgku0,1577359309.0,i’m 22 and i haven’t prayed 5 times a day in god knows how long. i also don’t fast during ramadan and don’t plan on doing so. i only wear a hijab because i still live with my parents but when i get into my car i take off my skirt and wear jeans
