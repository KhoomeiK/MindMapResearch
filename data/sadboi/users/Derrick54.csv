I know romantic relationships anyone can deal with, but a lot of the time, OPs will be talking about their relationship of 3, 4, 5+ years. How many middle/highschool relationships last that long? Not very many. When OPs leave their notes/life stories, the life stories usually be about they somebody who is 20 to 30 years old (OP will usually state this in their final goodbye/obituary type post). You can also tell by the way a lot of the OPs type. Not all adults type mature and with proper grammar, all minors type with emojis or slang, but it can be a give away if there is a ton of slang or strange sentence formatting. Post/comment/Subreddit history too. For example, r/teenagers would be a dead giveaway. 


Every now and then there may be a surge in minor activity compared to adult activity, like during exams, a lot of kids in highschool might start getting really stressed and there's more minor OPs posting... Or, during Christmas where while most minors are at home from school getting presents and with parents, some adults are alone or lonely, without many friends or family, and might feel more depressed or suicidal (holidays tend to have a spike in suicide attempts globally, so I imagine we'd have a spike in suicide posts on here).

Obesity is not measured by how many times you can put your fingers around your waist. It's measured by your BMI. Unless your doctor has told you that you're obese, you're _not_ obese. And if you're obese, you're obese because of your BMI. NOT BECAUSE of whether you can wrap your fingers around your waist or thighs. 

And, STOP comparing yourself to others. You are NOT other people. You are not as tall or short or as healthy or as unhealthy as somebody else. You can be 90 kg, but as long as you live a healthy lifestyle, you're doing pretty dang well. You can be 45 kilograms, but if you smoke, or starve yourself, or have hyperthyroidism, that's not good. That's not healthy. It's not about the pounds. It's not about your fingers or waist or thighs. 

Do you see this mentality you have, about the finger measurements thing? I need you to take it right now, and rip it out of your god damn head. Throw it out. Light it on fire, throw it out of a window, and watch it burn until it's nothing more than a pile of ashes. Make sure it's dead, make sure it's not coming back. 

Because, I don't know where or what you read  about this whole ""average"" stuff, and the thigh and finger waist thing, but it's bullshit. And it's unhealthy. It's unhealthy to view things like this. Not to mention, measuring yourself with just fingers isn't good. It isn't healthy. Nor is it accurate. 

Once again, people have different measurements and body types. You are not as tall as somebody else. You are not the same weight as somebody else. Your fingers are not the same length as somebody else. Your fat does not distribute in the same way as somebody else. You are NOT anyone else, not even close, unless you've got an identical twin. 

If you didn't read my edit, **read it.** I seriously need you to get this through your head, and god so help me, I will take this to the end of the Earth until you can understand. Do. Not. Measure. Yourself. With. Your. Fingers. Under. Any. Circumstance."

But, once again, fuck average. Don't strive for being average. Strive for being your own unique self, somebody who's happy and healthy, regardless of what some number says.

Edit: Also, for the record, putting your fingers around yourself is a GOD AWFUL way to measure stuff. I just tried it myself. I'm 15, I've been underweight my entire life, and now I'm a healthy one. I couldn't put my fingers around my thighs or waist back then, and I sure as hell can't do it now... I am 40 kilograms (90 lbs), give or take. In other words, still incredibly small. My hands are tiny. Like, so small they're an abomination. And, I'm also black. Coloured. We (as in a lot of ethnics, but not every black ethnic) tend to have bigger features than people with light skin. You probably know the stereotypes.

Have you ever heard of a biological clock? It's all the rage in studies and reports as to why schools -specifically high schools and universities- should have later start times, you know. Long story short, growing teens and young adults have a shift in when their melatonin is produced, causing them to not feel tired until later into the night. Most studies say around 11 or 12 at night. When I'm not dealing with life, I'm dealing with trying to force myself to fall asleep when I'm not tired. If I'm successful, I get enough hours of sleep, but it's not quality of sleep. You don't get quality of sleep from forcing yourself. You feel like shit.

I hated home, I hated school. At school I put on a fake smile, but I didn't even have friends back then. Fake or real. I talked to no one. I hated everyone. 

12 was also when they began to do the first suicide checks for people at my school. Basically all you did was answer a few questions about whether you had suicidal thoughts or attempted recently. They do two total checks in your school career, one in the middle of middle school, and one right before you go off to college (or at the very least leave highschool and are on your own). 

I didn't want to write down on the paper how I felt, but I did it anyways. I had anxiety meltdowns every day at school, so to say I was panicked is an understatement. In fact, I didn't even end up turning it into the teacher when she collected it. Which meant I had to go up to my teacher in the next period and ask to go down to the office, where then I was waiting in the office for nearly an hour. At any time I could have gotten up and walked out, said forget it and move on. But, I didn't. 

My parents did end up knowing about it (obviously, schools aren't allowed to keep information like that private).

It sounds like rather than anxiety about telling, you just have embarrassment, though correct me if I'm wrong. There is NOTHING to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. Don't let ANYBODY tell you otherwise. Teenager to teenager, I damn mean that. 

You don't even have to tell them. At least not face to face. Get a trusted friend to do it or leave a note. Of course you can talk and vent to other people, like your peers, but they unfortunately can't get the recourses you need. 


Do I personally regret telling them? Yes, but not for the reasons you may think. I'm happy that they knew. I'm glad that everybody final understood that my meltdowns were anxiety and my crying was depression. It wasn't just me being an angst teenager like everybody, specifically adults, always assumes (Adults can be the worst man, I tell ya' :p). It got me the help I needed. 

I regret it because it led down to a path of being on antidepressants, which left me feeling shittier than before I had started them. But, unlike you, I have experience and warnings. Do your research should you ever get out on any medication. Be it now, or ten years from now. You're smart, you have a phone or computer. Learn all the side effects, and tell your parents/doctor/therapist that you have some concerns about it. Goes especially for all medication that treats similar disorders or diseases. ADHD and anxiety meds are a big one too. 

Got any questions or wanna talk? Don't forget, I'm a teen too. I was 12 just three years ago. So I know how it feels to be in your shoes somewhat."

See the slightly rounded edges? Probably best to avoid something like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61L2j7rRyGL._SL1500_.jpg), however).  Basically just look for something just a tad bit sharper than kiddie scissors. No legitimate blades, i.e., knives, razors, tools, those are too risky. And no glass. With the right angle and enough pressure, you can draw blood with the scissors, but not too much. Don't literally cut yourself (like in the scissor motion), just open the scissors and use one of the blades. I've also found cuticle clippers to work with the same effect. Not too dangerous, but with enough pressure, they do the job, albeit half assed (we're looking for safety, not huge results). There's a ton of other things you can use. For rule of thumb, the object needs to be sharp enough to cut the skin with enough given pressure, but not enough to do the same damage a blade would. 

Make sure whatever you use is completely sterile, and clean your cut area before and after cutting. Always bandage or cover afterwards. 

If you cut too deep (though, that shouldn't be an issue with the methods provided), put constantly pressure on the cut for 5-10 minutes. If it doesn't stop, go to the emergency room or call emergency services. If you can see fat, call emergency services. If the cut is so wide it does not appear it can be closed just by pinching the skin (in other words, it seems like it'll need stitches), go to the emergency room, and call services if it's too severe."

Do we know how soon? Like, if it's tomorrow or in a few days, you need to act fast. If it's in like a month from now, act fast, but don't do anything like calling the police because they technically aren't in immediate danger. 

And, how open are they to talking about it? Sometimes people are really open, and those are usually the ones who aren't completely sure they want to do it, but not always, and sometimes people won't give you much more than that they're going to kill themselves soon, and that's usually the ones who are really set on doing it, or determined to not let anyone stop them. If it's the former, be there to listen. Try to get as much information as possible, but don't let that be your main goal. Let them know you're here for them, and you'll listen to anything they need to say. Ask if they have a plan or a method if the situation is appropriate. If they're not open, don't force them too badly. You may end up pushing them away.

My advice without knowing the things I asked would be to tell somebody close to them and keep an eye on them. If they don't have anybody besides you, then you need to be the person to keep an eye on them. Do that anyways, regardless of whether there's somebody else involved or not. If it's in the very near future, like in a few days, don't let them be alone. Remind them that you love and care for them, but have it come from your heart. Don't let it be the cliche things people hear all the time like ""You matter"" or ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" Have it be personal. ""I really care about you"" or ""[Somebody they know] really needs you.""

If they're a kid, definitely tell their parents. If they're in school, tell a counselor. If they live with somebody tell the person they live with.

If it's immediate danger, like within the next 24 or less hours, call your emergency services if you can't get a hold of them, or you're not able to make sure they're not alone. As soon as they reach the time period that's considered immediate danger, whether that's in a few days from now or a few months, also be sure to call the services.

I kept on cutting because I liked the stinging and the blood. The scars too. No reason in specific, I just really liked the stinging and the tiny bits of blood that came out. For me, my cutting was empowering (but the stupid empowering that a 12 year old finds cool) moreso than anything else. Kinda like ""fuck yeah, fuck what people tell me to do. I'm badass.""

I stopped for a while, and then started for a brief moment again to cut on my breasts, sort of like a fuck you to them, as I'm insecure about them and wish they were different.

I don't cut anymore because there's no need to. No need for me to feel empowered anymore. Mostly just because I stopped giving two shits about life. That, and the fact that I just don't bother anymore. If I wanted to, I'd have no problem cutting again, but I don't really care anymore.

In a few hours I bet you'll be posting something in r/bullying or maybe even r/rape.

SuicideWatch,f3nvz9i,t3_dhg0h0,1571003068.0,"Those are pretty much intrusive thoughts. Everybody gets them... Like, everybody gets them. Even normal happy everyday people get them. A lot of times they come in the form of being in a high place and suddenly wanting to jump off or driving your car and having an urge to swerve into a pole. It doesn't mean people who have these thoughts want to die, our brains out just weird. If anything, self-harmful thoughts like those usually symbolize the opposite. An instinct to live. A study was done on them in the 1920s(?) and I believe a more recent one took place too. Sometimes they also manifest in ways that aren't threatening to yourself, but instead to others... A lot of times people get an urge to punch a baby in the face or strangle a cute puppy. It doesn't even have to be violent. Somebody may get an urge to do something like grabbing a person's genitals or throwing their phones at a wall. Once again, doesn't mean you're crazy or evil or weird, just our brains are fucked up sometimes. They're called intrusive for a reason, we don't want them but they come anyways. 

HOWEVER, acting upon these thoughts or having them frequently is a cause for concern, and you should definitely speak to your doctor if you have ever acted on them or if they're frequent. Or, if you have a history of dangerous activities in the past. Sometimes people _do_ act on these things, even if it's not immediately, they may eventually work up the courage to do so. 

It's very tough to judge what's a normal amount of intrusive thoughts, and what kind of thoughts are normal, as they vary from person to person, so best bet is speaking to a doctor if you're genuinely concerned, regardless of whether they're frequent or you've acted. The best judgement is your own, not the internet's.

OCD (and similar disorders) increases the likelihood you'll have thoughts like those, especially if the thoughts are sexual or sexually abusive towards somebody... Rape or paedophilic thoughts are generally considered a cause for concern in general, but that's not coming from me, that's more of just what ""most people"" say, as like I've said, there's no exact measure of what kind of thoughts are normal and what aren't. But, I digress. 

There's nothing you can do to get rid of them. Not really. If they're normal occasional thoughts, just ignore them, they'll go away. Trying to intentionally make them go away may just make them stronger or stay longer. Like if I tell you not to think of an elephant right now, suddenly you're thinking of an elephant, and the harder you try not to think of it, the more it's in your mind, despite me saying to not think of it.

If there's another issue going on, then you should have already spoken to a doctor (or therapist), and medication or therapy is what will help you."
SuicideWatch,f34j9as,t3_dfm1p8,1570655308.0,"> will my parents get arrested? 

Depending upon your age, the context and situation, and the law where you live, answers vary, but probably not unless you were encouraged by your parents to overdose or if they were neglectful or abusive. 

 > what will happen to them?

 Legally, not much. Not unless they've done something akin to what I've mentioned above. Emotionally, they'd probably be fucked for life, but I assume you mean legally, so not much will happen. 

 > Also if I fail, what will happen to me? 

Physically, depending on how much damage you do, you could cause some of your organs to fail, and you may be on life support for a long time. That's assuming you even make it that far. It's _very_ hard to overdose enough to kill you. At worst, statistically you'd probably give yourself some hella intense pains, vomit, black out, or have something like a seizure or hallucinations (or all of that combined and more). There's always the chance you give yourself failure, but it doesn't happen that often with overdoses (in relativity to the amount of overdoses that take place). You're even less likely to manage to get yourself killed.

Either way you'd be admitted to the hospital, initially for any care needed for the overdose, along with other check-ups to make sure you're doing okay, and then you'd probably be given an psychological evaluation. 

 > Would they have to lock me up in a mental hospital? 

Depends once again. You know the drill. Age, location, context and situation, and your mental health and state at the time of/after your attempt, in addition to previous histories and attempts. 

 > Would they take me and my siblings away from my parents? 

Probably not, but there's always a possibility. You seem young, so I imagine a social worker may come and check up on your family and your siblings and determine if the setting is a safe and stable place for your siblings to continue to live in. As long as you and your siblings aren't being abused nor neglected (or any of that sort), then you and your siblings will be okay on the terms of getting taken. 

How old are you? I'm curious. No need to answer, though. 

I'm not telling you to kill yourself, but I'm also not the guy who's gonna be like ""No, don't kill yourself!"" because it's your decision, and I honestly don't want to influence it one way or another... However, please don't let it be by overdosing. That shit can really mess you up, and it's really hard to die by it. Like, really hard. Overdosing usually involves excruciating pain for hours on end, whether it's successful or not. The pain may even last for weeks. Really wouldn't recommend it."

No. That's not how it works. We have depression, just like every other human with depression, and being kinder isn't going to fix anything. You mean well, I know you do, but it's quite insulting.
