Just to be sure I have communicated it well - when I read and listen through his ideas, I every time take some time after it sitting alone, to reflect if I can see what he is talking about in my life or if I can not.  
Because I have been abused, gaslighted in my past, I'm usually very suspicious about being tricked. Therefore I make up my own ideas very considerately, to be sure that whatever I let into my mind affects me in a healthy way in the long term.

_(That is why I do public signing of others keys (wich is the standard with the `--sign` command **only** when I plan to export them **with** my sign on it)_

Are you managing the different environments with the `--homedir` command, as in
> `gpg --homedir /home/sotoc20173/keyringA`

and
> `gpg --homedir /home/sotoc20173/keyringB`

?

If so, then  
I would just create a new directory and do a clean import of the received public key:
> `mkdir /home/sotoc20173/keyringC`  

> `gpg --homedir /home/sotoc20173/keyringC --import /home/sotoc20173/downloads/userXY.pubkey.asc`

Now the imported key in the keyringC should not signed at all by any of your keys.
