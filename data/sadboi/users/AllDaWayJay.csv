I’m finding it hard to fathom the idea of setting down roots, creating a family and all that, only to have it taken away from me on a whim of someone who’s only a representative and doesn’t speak directly on my behalf(I assume the chief is the representative in the context above) 

“Knowing ones place” 
I realize this was your personal takeaway from what you’ve experienced within the confines of what you were exposed to, but the culture as a whole?

PTSweeD,fkuxvs1,t3_fh2yir,1584558185.0,"Relinquishing anger has given rise to my anxiety. The severity now pales in comparison to years past. 
 Exuding a faux “hard” exterior, wreaking havoc at work/home for no apparent reason. Yelling, screaming, always creating BS, all to mask a truth. Appearing angry, the attitude, the weight, the urge to create chaos, all of it, gone
 And in its place, something I’ve always deemed a weakness...Anxiety. Constant trembling of my hands when in public. I can’t stop it either. It comes and goes without a semblance of a trigger. It just happens. 
 This trembling has made me realize something...I’ve been angry and anxious all my life. I can’t for the life of me recall a time when I wasn’t a nervous wreck or attempting to hide behind a faux angry exterior 

 I was belittled for it. Called names for my inability to identify the trembling in my hands. I was taught that being anxious wasn’t a worthy personality trait to hold onto. It wasn’t “manly” to show fear no matter the form it took

 I’ve often wondered as an adult, had such disciplines been administered by teachers, uncles, aunts, pastors, friends, neighboring children, cousins, the village idiot, or [insert anyone from OUTSIDE my then home], would this ‘instilled natural prolixity’ still exist? 

 Given the origin of the mentality being taught, it becomes a quandary for a befuddled child with a underdeveloped, nonexistent mental fortitude to circumvent. As if navigating narcissism, toxic positivity, violence(mental, sexual, and physical) wasn’t enough, imagine it thru the eyes of a child.
 To be taught as a child that being anxious is undesirable and to succumb to the beratement that followed suit consistently, could have one or two effects on the psyche of a child. Effects that would go on to mold this individual for years to come

But I have to agree with the original post, the relationship between woody and buzz, I would’ve loved to see an ending fitting of their  long and adventurous relationship. Growing up to these characters, perhaps there was a side of me that was selfish that only wanted to see characters I grew up with. However, not a lot of stuff that Keanu Reeves or Key and Peele work on are kid friendly. Having them in films my kids want to see is a huge plus for me

They also introduced other new characters that took up more screen time than the characters I just mentioned. There was forky and the antagonist of the film, the doll. They seemed to have quite a bit more screen time I noticed than the previous list. Wasn’t buzz in all 4 films?
