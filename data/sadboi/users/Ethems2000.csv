RelationshipAdviceNow,fqwnq84,t1_fqw4q2s,1589711260.0,So they understand and then they won’t interrupt when we are having a private moment. It’ll be less stressful because we have to stop every 5 minutes to check if anyone is coming and it’s not a relaxed environment unless they knew and then we told them we are busy and they’d be fine with it. I don’t know how to open up to my girlfriends parents

You can find a friend interest them with one of your hobbies, show it off to them, take them to a movie or something. Also you can go to the park and talk to each other or even go on holiday. A chat with a friend is really healthy to strengthen a bond so you enjoy each other understand one another and more. Make sure if they’re online people you decide to meet then be safe, oki 🙃"
depression,fqvaii8,t3_gl52kz,1589673182.0,You love her right and looks don’t matter cus she’s the same girl. Try to restart if you know what I mean because it can be a good thing aswell. Be there for her and care and give her an option to be back in love with you. She loved you before doesn’t mean she won’t love you again so go for it!

depression,fcvkpwe,t3_edpkii,1578004175.0,"Tell me about it. I get super fucking angry because I did something wrong and then I go be angry in another room but then take all the anger on my self and then refuse to calm down at all and change that anger into depression giving me a massive urge to make my self bleed or put my self in pain as any ways as possible and I can never control my anger or I get embarrassed and get upset then get depressed again. I’ve also had a long history of cutting and once I start a cut then I end up doing both my arms and still my parents don’t give a fuck. My mom only gives a fucking shit about her own reputation and if I mention that I wanna kms then she said ooo what if I killed myself, like fuck same man. Literally an endless depression train for me. Also I told my dad that I have hurt my self a lot and he said he had better things to deal with and I said what to him and then he said work and his self like what the fuck is wrong with this dude. Plus I’ve had a history with my dad. Basically when I was little he had really bad anger issues and bare in mind I was only a few months old and so I was crying and so he behind my
Moms own back whilst she’s out, he picks me up by my fucking head angry and frustrated as fuck and then shakes me and now he’s done the same shortly after to my brother though whilst my mom whitenesses it. Furthermore we fled Germany and then when I was 10 he got in contact with me and only wanted me for my mom to get a divorce so I got upset. A few years later in my 14th year he contacts me again saying how good he is and trying to make my mom as bad and then tries to get me to live with him and later he didn’t give one fuck about me cutting and he’s not in rehab because he can’t deal with the past when he shook me and my brother. Right now I don’t give a fuck about my dad and think he should be buried in my
Mind to never think about him ever. I can’t handle people’s troubles because it effects me more stressing me out because idk if that particular person is okay or not and then I get depressed because of the amount of worrying I have to have which I can’t control without being a psychopath which doesn’t give a shit and lie to get what I want which I’m thinking that’s the path I might choose because then I’m free to do what I want and I won’t be the one to ever be depressed and I know there are going to be upset people but I gotta choose what’s good for me and the best options instead of worrying about others more than myself cuz it’s not worth it at all😂 thanks for listening guys and hope my venting is okay to you."
