bodymods,flnkswy,t1_flngvta,1585320681.0,"With a horseshoe my lips and movement of my face always moves it but because this barbell in deeper in my nose, I don’t ever mistakenly touch it and most of the time I don’t even realize it’s there so that may be why it never moves for me. Also the shape of my nose kind of “encapsulates” it so no unnecessary nudging! Someone said it might not be a good idea with heavy jewelry because it can put too much strain on one side more than the other so if that happens you might wanna change it? I don’t really know, but hope it turns out good for you! <3"
bodymods,flnkg2t,t1_flnh1wt,1585320469.0,Noted! I have no problems with it moving very much and i went to a piercer in Japan for appropriate sizing! It’s healed too so I change it sometimes if need be! Thanks though I didn’t know that!

Came to that realization when someone told me they would listen. And for the first time in my life I told someone all about my deep dark depression, and then they got mad and told me they don’t have time for me when they have problems of their own and that they can’t put their life aside to help me when they’re the one who offered. And now I feel betrayed and heartbroken. I’ll never trust anyone with my depression again."
depression,ffm97b1,t3_eu6yv7,1580050809.0,"Why end up like your sister (no offense). By become a druggie like your mother that u dislike so much. Why do exactly what the world expects of people like you who grow up/are surrounded by horrible influences? Be different. Be strong. Don’t end up like your parents or your sister (no offense). Be you. Show them that there’s a better way to life than drugs and alcohol. That there’s a better way to life than to just give up and kill yourself. Funny coming from me bc I’m suicidal too but thinking like this helps get through the pain and strive for excellence. Find a hobby you’re good at and get better idk. Dont let society make you believe that killing yourself is the way to go when you’re in that type of situation. Tell everyone to kiss your ass, and do something great. Not something great that everyone will see as great, but something great that YOU think is great."
