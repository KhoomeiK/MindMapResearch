InteriorDesign,fptrlpa,t3_gfayou,1588896854.0,"Nope, don't believe in it. In my opinion this biophilic design concept is not necessarily appealing. I called b.s. from the first chart with the links to health outcomes - it seemed very arbitrary. Who's to say water features don't also improve sleep and encourage social activity, as do views of nature? Who's to say varied spatial environment doesn't promote all the other health outcomes as well as social activity?

Then the images of designs shown as examples of biophilic, to me are pretty off-putting. The living room with the gigantic waterfall of plants is kind of scary and overpowering. I don't want a million plants cave-like indoors, nor do I want a to sit in a room surrounded by shards of wood. To me a lot of the green feels misplaced in these designs, and would actually be disturbing.

I think nature can be beautifully incorporated into any design, but not in this forced way. The aesthetics of it seem wrong to me and sometimes actually unsettling."

However, I see the  sloppiness of the bottom half of the burger as intentionally thought-provoking. Along with the messy insides of the ketchup bottle,  the mustard overtopping its container, the table dirty with particles of food and pepper, even the napkins half out of their holder, as though ready for mopping up a spill - these all combine to suggest to me the idea of unwholesome excess. Even the salt reflected in the mirror-like surface of the napkin holder can be seen as reflecting its high content in the burger.


Overall I think this painting can be viewed more than just literally. Superficially it's a gorgeously coloured, beautiful example of realism. But as I look deeper, I think it could be seen as a meditation on how typical modern food enables us to thoughtlessly over-indulge.


Admittedly I would still inhale that burger, even though the bottom bun looks a bit soggy and off-putting for my tastes."
