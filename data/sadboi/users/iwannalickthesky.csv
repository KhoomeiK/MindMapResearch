depression,fjmu9m5,t1_fjmr64p,1583484309.0,"i do agree with you to an extent. i think stuff like starving yourself, binge eating, isolating yourself and overexcercising could technically be considered self harm, but saying that everyone that has doubted themselves has self harmed is a bit of a reach in my opinion"
depression,fjmktik,t3_fe5hgw,1583473602.0,"personally, i disagree. self harm =/= self destructive behavior. especially stuff like putting yourself down, that's not self harm, it's insecurity. i get where you're coming from, but i think it's better when things like cutting yourself and purposefully not getting enough sleep aren't put in the same category just because they're both bad for you. obviously, if you're experiencing self destructive thoughts, seek help, but imo saying that ""everyone has self harmed"" downplays the experience and sort of normalises self harming"
