HealthAnxiety,f2ud01l,t1_f2u5oyk,1570413384.0,Very good chance that’s it. It’s a pretty drastic change in the routine and lifestyle. I suspect life should quiet down a whole lot once you get used to the routine. Good luck. I hope you enjoy your new job once u settle in.
HealthAnxiety,f2txxf6,t3_de6xl3,1570402408.0,"So normal. And panic attacks cannot be entirely subdued. But those attacks are telling you something. Food, sleep, relationship stress, etc. Identifying triggers can help a whole lot."
adhd_anxiety,f2psz9z,t3_ddxtw6,1570349860.0,"So I learned this in kindergarten from a teacher who always had us facing west. Yes I grew up, I would always have to face West to be sure which one was left and which one was right. I knew I didn’t really have to face west but… When I started driving, I was sometimes confused because I didn’t know which direction was west, but fortunately I was saved by the blinker signal."
ADHD,f1uytew,t3_daroid,1569765165.0,"As you get older, you will understand this better: human bodies are never perfect and a great deal of research has gone into helping with the problem. Some peoples bodies don’t manage sugar well. Some peoples bodies lack thyroid hormones. The number of things that can go wrong is actually dizzying. But the idea that we shouldn’t take medication is based in this idea that we should somehow be perfect without it. No. Part of the art of living today is recognizing problems and finding the best way to address those problems. Lots of times the answer is medication, although not always. But especially in a time of transition, I would not mess with something that works."
mentalhealth,epu2lyj,t3_bvv1sq,1559502491.0,"Good insight. You can end up being viewed as weak. I'd say pick confidants carefully. Your good friends should be there for you. But some laundry may be best left unaired. My mom was nurse manager of a psych unit and she had an observation that stuck with me: She thought it was better not to spend a lot of time in therapy for traumas sometimes, because discussion tended to solidify memories and add to their importance. You spend too much time looking at what's wrong, that can actually magnify the effects."
HealthAnxiety,eoxopva,t3_btgiei,1558926884.0,About the fact you have never had allergies: My mold allergy kicked in when I was about thirty. Allergies can wax and wane too.

Anxiety,eoxo5pd,t1_eowbrvs,1558926660.0,"Thank you. Husband has been ill and he cannot stand up right now. Life involves transfer boards, therapy, some home help, helping him at night, and it's just weird. I also seem to have flunked a mammogram, although hopefully that will be OK. Just too much reality. I'm much better this evening. If you do reply and I end up taking awhile getting back to you -- Reddit is quirky for me and sometimes ignores my attempts to communicate. But thanks again. It helps to know someone is listening and I don't complain here because he has enough to deal with."
Anxiety,eouzw5k,t3_bt22ex,1558885338.0,"Yeah, but I'm still crying right now. Thanks for the support though."
