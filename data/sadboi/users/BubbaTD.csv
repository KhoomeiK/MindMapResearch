I sincerely hope this helps 

This is a journey, not the end. 

Therapy is good, finding a support group who have gone through your experience with those who have been on the journey and are doing better now is key.  People open up better to those who experience the same journey. Those people who on the same journey are examples and proof you can be happier. They will no cure you, they walk WITH YOU on journey through the Dark Forrest and becomes a safe place for you to speak and express. The worst pain is your pain.  Nobody can cure your pain but there are those who can walk with you on this journey into the dark wilderness.  I speak from experience. My sons suicide has made extreme effects. You pain is certainly different as it is yours. There is always people who love you and would devastated...devastated with lasting effect if you left.    

There are those who will say, get over it, this will pass and so on. Save your anger people simply don't know how to react really particularly if they have not had such a life changing experience. Everyone responds differently. I respond differently now considerably different than before my experience. Friends and family do not speak much to my family as they did. This is going to happen. For some time i became the 800 pound gorilla in the room.  It is OK to feel how you do. Again, your pain is the worst pain as it is yours. 

Authorities definitely need to be involved. Find a support group with those who can let you see you can be a happier person. 

Perhaps: [https://centers.rainn.org/](https://centers.rainn.org/) or [http://rcclv.org/support-groups/](http://rcclv.org/support-groups/)

Find a support group in your area that is about helping you on your journey. I avoided support group for suicide survivors for two years. **Thought what can anyone possibly do to or say anything that is going to help. I do not think that now. Now I support those who are on my journey.** 

&#x200B;

After moving through the natural phases of the journey, I have developed more empathy for others. Everyone is someones loved one that hopefully you will arrive to in one manner or another. I hope you find parallels.

You can be happier, I am not just blowing smoke up your ass."
