With GF releasing an entirely new experience every year (or so it seems in recent years) - to wait for a (good amount of) content update of Temtem would be as long as a new pokemon to come out.

Unless they go full Sea of Thieves about it (monthly update) - I imagine there will still be cool events most of the time wich is ""smol"" but fine!

Yet you are probably right and I agree that they will probably push their game further with content - it's just going to take time imo!"

edit : citation d'un article de lemonde. fr

 « Choisi pour réaliser l’affiche fêtant les 30 ans du Centre belge de la bande dessinée (CBBD), musée consacré au 9e art et ouvert à Bruxelles en 1989, le dessinateur Emmanuel Lepage s’est vu interdire par les ayants droit d’Hergé d’utiliser la fusée au damier rouge et blanc, empruntée par Tintin dans les albums Objectif Lune et On a marché sur la Lune (Casterman).

Réalisé avant l’été et rendu public le 27 août sur le compte Instagram d’Emmanuel Lepage, le dessin se voulait un hommage aux grandes figures de la bande dessinée.” »"

It's just the app confusing you into seeing things that way. That's really sad. I don't go in the streets thinking ""oh wow what a generic person"" and the minimum of conversation break down the belief. But you fall easily under this assumption with tinder.

The cats could represent your feelings. Cats are pets we project a lot of feelings on.
Each of em are different and I can't name the feelings involved here.
The fact that they use a ouija means they are kind of lost in their life - to the point they have come to rely on black magic instead of logic.
They are working together to get back on track. Wich mean - to find their lost identity and reaching for help. 
Although, they actually are reaching for Satan, or whatever evil spirit misleading them and watching over them.
It's a human face. It might be you, it might be not. It's a darker version of someone, the personnification of something you fear. It might be your inner demons, or your actual illness. In any case, it's inside of you, because the scene takes place in an interior.
To sum it up, In their despair, the cats have reached for the wrong kind of help and are going to be played by the evil face."

Did the AI chose its name or was it named ?

Is the name a reference to something in the past ?

Is its name a way to assert power ? To cast and promote a new age, a new langage ?

Does the name have a backstory, or is it entirely made up ?

In the end, it must look like you picked at random, but you're going to explain it all at some point, because it was not

Par contre, je participe à l'économie des bouteilles en plastiques, et ça me fait pas plaisir... Mais sinon je bois pas d'eau.

On m'a recemmen parler de bâtons de carbone à mettre dans une bouteille d'eau du robinet, pour neutraliser le goût. Apparemment c'est écologique. Il faudrait que j'essaye. Je suis tout à fait pour ne plus avoir à me trimballer des bouteilles en plastiques, c'est plus une gourde et un robinet."
