PPeperomioides,foki7qg,t3_g7zaj9,1587842539.0,For a plant to put out pups it need to be so healthy that it is willing to waste the energy. If you’ve gotten it recently it is still probably trying to adjust to the new light/water/environment. Give it some time. Only water it when the soil has completely dried out and give it strong indirect light. I would also recommend using the tiniest bit of fertilizer every other time you water. And don’t freak out if a lower leaf slowly turns yellow. That’s normal. As long as there is new growth out the top you should be fine. Mine didn’t put out pups until a year after I had it and now it won’t stop

I reject the idea that drag is a form of trans oppression and that anyone who participates in drag is transphobic. Cis queer people can absolutely be transphobic and there are certain aspects of drag that are absolutely transphobic and dangerous. Drag as a whole is an expansive art form and has gone through many evolutions. You are correct that many parts of drag are outdated and need to go away. I still think it is important today to allow people to play around and experiment with gender expression and that is in no way mocking trans people.

Dressing as an extreme version of  feminine characteristics and dressing in a way that confirms to your gender identity are very different. Gay men did not take a trans thing and make it their own. The distinction between drag and trans is only a recent distinction and to go back and reinterpret history through contemporary language is not accurate. Sylvia Rivera refers to herself as a drag queen and a cross dresser. Drag did not begin as a way to disenfranchise trans people. It was started by trans, gay, and queer people who were all equally oppressed and wanted free expression.
