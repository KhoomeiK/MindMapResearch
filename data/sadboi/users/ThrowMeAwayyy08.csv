Mommit,fr02esl,t1_fqzx3va,1589781746.0,I remember I but my brother when I was little and he never did it again lol I don’t know if he’s too young to understand that it’s bad but he really just tried to nibble . I can’t trust his kisses anymore lol
Parenting,fpe57y4,t3_gcv69t,1588540587.0,You’re not alone. I love my kid so much and he’s the best thing to ever happen to me but I miss my freedom and my old life so much. It’s so much responsibility and before someone comes at me I was very clear about it but my husband and my entire family were like “omg it’s a blessing (it is) and we’re going to help you with everything”. My husband is at work 12 hours a day 6 days a week and my mom will only watch him for an hour tops. So they look at me crazy when I vocal about how over whelmed I am and how much I hate this shit. Everyone gets to leave but we as moms have to stay all the fucking time. As much as people try to be like “50/50 responsibility” we all know it’s not like that.
EstrangedAdultChild,fo4obc9,t1_fo4hj3t,1587508074.0,Literally my whole family and they said so that I wouldn’t feel guilty and now I’m starting to feel guilty.
relationships,fo0fqxi,t1_fo041w8,1587412320.0,You’re right thank you! Have a good day!
relationships,fnzwzqp,t1_fnzwm60,1587402201.0,I really like that thank you!!!!
relationships,fnzwxhh,t1_fnzw53s,1587402170.0,No he doesn’t work around covid patients so he’s not too worried about that. He’s definitely been stressing about starting the new job but I remind him everyday that he’s a hard worker and he cares for people and that’s what’s going to make him into an amazing nurse.
relationships,fnzwpv3,t1_fnz0ret,1587402066.0,"Yea it seems he’s on autopilot because he has a goal but he forgets to be in that moment sometimes until he reaches that goal. It’s an amazing trait to have but it took four years to reach his goal of becoming a nurse and I stood behind him, waited and supported him 100000%. Now, I thought we’d have more time together but his new goal is to buy a house so all he wants to do now is work 6 days a week over 12 hour shifts and when he’s home he’s on his phone looking at medical stuff or looking at houses that were months away from even being able to look at. I wish he would be more present and relax sometimes. All we talk about is plans and the future but sometimes I don’t want to talk and just be lovey."
relationships,fnzw7dj,t1_fnz2awf,1587401813.0,"Thank you, I’m going to try and use this. I don’t want to just keep telling him because then that turns into nagging and no one likes that lol"
relationships,fnzvvb4,t1_fnzc3zp,1587401654.0,I have to try  and get things out of him but he does tell me when he’s stressed. I usually have to call it out when he’s acting extra sarcastic. When I try and talk to him and tell him how I feel he doesn’t really say anything. He just tried to hug and kiss me and says he loves me but that’s as I’m trying to talk to he kind of does it to shut me up and I’ve told him I don’t like that.
relationships,fnzvf6e,t1_fnzuctq,1587401430.0,"Well, he said he wanted to go to school so I bust my ass for two years so he didn’t have to work and could focus. Now he’s a nurse and he’s focused on buying a house and wants me to stay home, so I quit my job and I stay home with our child and do the best I can to make sure he’s happy and taken care of. But, you’re absolutely right because this is a post about MY issues.  When he talks to me and tells me what he needs I listen and try my best, all I asked for was some affection lol"
relationships,fnzsuex,t1_fnz5lar,1587400153.0,Thank you so much for your concern and for being that person. I had a crazy day and gave MYSELF quarantine bangs lol they don’t look too bad either 🙃
relationships,fnzspec,t1_fnz78lb,1587400083.0,"I do care about his issuers. I talk to him, I listen to him, and if there’s anything that I can do to try  and make him happy whether it’s spaghetti every night for dinner then I make it happen to show that I appreciate his hard work. When did I say I didn’t care about his issues?"
Parenting,fno2pu6,t1_fnnlpxc,1587109899.0,"Currently one year postpartum and still feel this sentence to my bones. I love my child so much, but this is hard and it kind of sucks a little bit lol"
relationships,flrsict,t3_fqq6nd,1585426919.0,Just hug him. Let him just sit there quietly or sobbing but just hold him. That’s what I would want. Nothing anyone can say or try to do will help but being held feels nice and safe. You are his person. My condolences to your whole family.
relationships,flq7sme,t3_fq25wd,1585382716.0,This is your dream. You aren’t even 100% sure that he’s going to propose and you’ve been working so hard for thing and probably for longer than you’ve been dating him. Don’t let your dream go for ANY man/ woman.
relationships,flj9b6a,t3_fosgtu,1585203253.0,It sounds exactly like me relationship except when I finally decided to leave I found out I was pregnant. I thought maybe this is a sign and I’m meant to be with him. One head later and I’m still just as unhappy but now it’s just complicated because there’s a child involved. If you don’t have a lot holding you back you should leave. I remember day dreaming about having my very own place and being so excited. Don’t waste any more time.

relationships,fizhlrs,t3_fan9zw,1582863044.0,I want to leave with my baby but He’s told me before that he will take the baby and I will be a part time parent. I don’t want that. I know my moms will help me so I have a place to go. My biggest worry is that he won’t give me back the baby.
coparenting,fgvy446,t1_fguipan,1581154428.0,We’re not married but have been together since we were teens. We talk about marriage but neither of us are rushing into it anymore so I just wear a ring. I’ve tried suggesting counseling but he pretty much dismissed and I never brought it back up again.
gonewildstories,fdemj62,t1_fdcjpw6,1578342168.0,"She literally yelled for him to stop. No means no, stop means fucking stop. Weirdo."
gonewildstories,fd8fcd7,t1_fd7dgh5,1578217722.0,If he was sloppy drunk he wouldn’t be able to get his dick hard. He knew what he was doing. I’m sorry this Happened to you.
Anxiety,fd8bje5,t3_ek6axv,1578216396.0,"I understand about the bullying part. I get some sort of comment almost every day at work because I’m Mexican and I try to play it off by degrading myself. But on a serious note, I’m scared too. I’m scared for my friends and my family and for our country. Even though I get Shit on for being Mexican the US is still my county and I am so scared of what will happen."

Mommit,f5oux69,t1_f5oqcuw,1572333617.0,That makes sense. Thank you so much. I was really over thinking it. I didn’t know what time I should give it to him and I was about to replace that for one of his meals. I’ll have to get more info from my ped next time I see her. Getting a schedule down is a little difficult lol
Mommit,f5opqsp,t1_f5oe8lp,1572326163.0,Thank you! I didn’t know I was supposed to follow it with the milk. My ped didn’t explain it too well.
Mommit,f5opoqg,t1_f5okvvo,1572326094.0,Thank you! That was what I was kind of confused about. I didn’t know if it would make him sick or over stuff him. I’ll try it out again tomorrow after his bottle.
Mommit,f5opnbj,t1_f5ogxdd,1572326047.0,Ok thank you!!! That’s what I was confused about and didn’t want to stuff him with banana purée if it was his first time actually eating it.
