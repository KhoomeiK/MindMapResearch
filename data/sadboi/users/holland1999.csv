CrappyDesign,fmtlp3w,t1_fms7aqm,1586374880.0,oh it’s real lol. it’s an ad for a pizza place in quebec that showed up on my facebook. likely a non english speaker. but my focus was more just in the bad placement of the large text.
tokyopoliceclub,fmkdmuy,t3_fvoq7z,1586151513.0,the whole elephant shell album isn’t on spotify or apple music (in canada at least) and hasn’t been for almost a week now i think. i can’t find any reason why! but i listen to this album so much and i really want it back :(

also i’ll mention that once you get your campsite, the villager that first appears is required to move into your town whether you want them or not."

AnimalCrossing,fm7huwz,t1_fm7ht11,1585827547.0,make sure you’re connected to the internet when you open the game! try closing and opening again. if the download isn’t downloaded then it should print you.
AnimalCrossing,fm59o09,t1_fm58qjm,1585768894.0,"yes that would work, but your book miles islands won’t have villagers on them if you don’t have free plots"
AnimalCrossing,fm59gpl,t1_fm59b4h,1585768785.0,"this happened to me too, i had to turn the game off and turn it back on and it worked. do be sure you’re connected to the internet and your nintendo account is linked."

AnimalCrossing,fm5951a,t1_fm58xs9,1585768614.0,"complaining and hitting them with a net won’t work. unfortunately it’s just random, you will see a villager with thought bubbles, approach them and they may ask you if you think they should move. another way to replace a villager is through using an amiibo villager and getting them to move in when your town is at max capacity."

AnimalCrossing,fm58bwr,t1_fm585ix,1585768187.0,random villagers CAN move into your plots if they’re unclaimed over night.
AnimalCrossing,fm588at,t1_fm57vao,1585768135.0,they will just usually say a comment like “have we met before?” nothing significant! the one on your sister’s island won’t act like the same one on your island.
AnimalCrossing,fm582qf,t1_fm57zxb,1585768053.0,"try closing your game and opening it up again, that works for me. make sure your nintendo account is linked to your profile and that you’ve been online!"

AnimalCrossing,flww5c3,t1_flwuwrd,1585567507.0,"i’m not sure if you still get random visits, but if you invite from amiibo, you can still invite the villager to live on your island and then it’ll ask you to choose a villager to get rid of essentially."
halifax,fluja7v,t1_flugcdz,1585503726.0,it is somewhat representative when you look at the percentage of positive tests vs percentage of negative tests. there are more people not sick that aren’t getting tested (obviously) than those that are sick and haven’t been able to get tested.
