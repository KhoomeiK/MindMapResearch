FemaleLevelUpStrategy,fpu9cds,t3_fwpdo2,1588907521.0,"I don't know if I'm writing this too late but me. My(28) (now ex) boyfriend(29) was angry over something that wasn't about me and somehow it turned into him being mad at me and he said he was going to move out. I said okay since I had been wanting to and was on the fence about the relationship (his anger issues, lack of sex, not stopping porn, general inattentiveness though it wasn't all 100% bad). He asked if I wanted to break up and I said no but maybe it's for the best, so we did. My friend in the next city over (30-45 min drive) offered up her spare room for rent when I told her, so from the break up last Monday, I was moved out by Saturday.  


I'm not gonna lie, it's tough. I still have heavy feelings even though he's more than likely a LVM, and I am struggling not to contact him, I feel like I won't go anywhere in life though if I don't take this time away.  


I'm glad about the move though, bf or not because I really hated the city I was in, I felt like I couldn't walk down the street without getting bothered. Now I have a nice park I can walk to (in shorts!), a nice yard my dog can chill in, and a new place to explore (once quarantine's over)."

I know it doesn't do much, but it's like a little glimmer of hope among all the bad thoughts right now.

I'd wake up with nausea and I'd poop several times a day, and maybe eat like a handful of strawberries throughout the day. My appetite is a bit better now, but I feel like it's more of a chore to eat than something I enjoy, I don't really wanna cook but I force myself to. Honestly, weed helps but I don't want to have to rely on that. I wish I had better advice for you.

Maybe go to a friend's house, have some wine (also good for munchies), and cook something you've never cooked before with them.

I hope you feel better. I know what it's like to have anxiety make your body betray you when you really need to be eating, not eating makes your body feel worse."

Also, he can't be all that repentant if he stopped and started back up again. You can do so much better. You deserve to be respected. As for what to do, only you can figure that out.
