mentalhealth,ffqlb78,t1_ffqjcfa,1580137668.0,"I've had issues since I was a teenager and had several episodes of self harm but never sought help. In 2013, I went to the US for my MBA. After a horrible incident which gave me PTSD  and I started self harming again. On one of those instances, I felt that I might not be able to stop and finally contacted the University counseling centre and was diagnosed with major depression.   When I moved to Chicago for work, I found another therapist who was good. She was the one who told me that I have PTSD. I even saw two different psychiatrists and tried different meds but had limited success. 

In 2016, I had to return home due to issues with my work visa. I was glad to be home but at the same time, I lost access to all my docs. I was ok for a while, but slowly got depressed again. I didn't want to start over again with a new therapist so I kept putting it off. Then in Nov 2018, I had a huge fight with my sister and I became suicidal. It went from just ideation to having a plan. Luckily I made it though that day and saw a doctor the next day. I've been on meds since then. The dosage and mix have varied. At the peak, I was taking 5 different antidepressants/ antianxiety meds. 

Once, they started working, I was more clear headed and able to deal with my issues. I worked on getting closure on few things which were bothering me. It's only after that, that I felt more at peace and told my doctor that I was ready to get off my meds. It took another 6 months of him slowly reducing the dosage and eliminating the meds one by one before I could stop. 

I still have depressive episodes, but they aren't as intense and don't last as long. The main perk is not feeling suicidal on a daily basis. I even find myself smiling more üòä"
