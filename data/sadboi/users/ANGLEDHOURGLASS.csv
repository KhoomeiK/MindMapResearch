EatingDisorders,fnsiph1,t3_g3laic,1587222443.0,"If I had to decide between yes or no, I would say yes. A lot of people with eating disorders (including myself) feel this way about food. The general term for it is ""food guilt"" for thoughts like ""I shouldn't have eaten that,"" or ""I'll do better tomorrow to make up for today."" I also, want to say that it is really difficult to admit that one has a problem. So, it's a great first step and good job. I have been dealing with these sentiments for 4 years and only admited yesterday to my therapist that I have an ed. I hope this helps and please look into getting help. Good luck üçÄ"
EatingDisorders,fndq2zv,t3_g0xc7x,1586875326.0,Yea Abby sharp even responds
EatingDisorders,fkqtbey,t3_fk2oym,1584455067.0,"I would say yes, and the next time you see her doing some that alarms you maybe gently ask her about it. It could be super vague, like do you want to talk about something? Or how are you feeling these days?"
EatingDisorders,fknnpmq,t3_fjkrgj,1584370015.0,"Honestly therapy helped me a lot, if you can try and find a therapist who specializes in Ed's. Good luck I wish you well üçÄ"

fuckeatingdisorders,fk9i9u4,t1_fk9hpgt,1583976621.0,"thank you, I have been in such a state tonight that I can't get work done. This helped me might just tell one of them. on top of all of this its also my mom's birthday, so I've had to eat a lot today guess that was triggered this meltdown, ah. Birthdays are so freaking hard, but thank you."
fuckeatingdisorders,fk9c233,t3_fh3pi3,1583973000.0,"I think eating three meals would help you a lot. It helps me be consistent. even if you do it slowly. just have lunch and dinner, then bump it up to three meals in a week. baby steps are really important for ed recovery if you do too much you freak yourself out. trust me been there. also if you are training maybe try to eventually try having a snack before or after. if that is too much I tend to workout after dinner so my pre-workout is dinner/dessert. Good luck!!"
EDAnonymous,fjsh6s3,t3_fet5rf,1583596952.0,"I 100% feel this way I am trying to recover rn and my lw was never technically anorexic but my period stopped, my nails were blue from being cold, I fainted all the time/ light headed, and exercised more then I should have. I was very sick since then I've gained and am doing better but its still really hard. Two months of recovery is not gonna fix 4 years of habit, regardless of how much I weigh or how I looked."
EDAnonymous,f5slt8y,t3_dp21ax,1572435999.0,"Omg same. I just got my hair cut a few days ago and everyone is complimenting it. saying "" it looks so healthy!"" or ""it looks so good!"" I have never gotten so many compliments in my life, in a short duration of time. I can't help but think it's because I finally hit my GW and have officially lost 36lb in 14 months. It's been such a good fucking week."
