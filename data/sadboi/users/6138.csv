This feel-good neuro-diversity stuff is portraying autism as a ""difference, not a disability"". This isn't true.

Autism is pain, misery, and suffering. Some people might do ok with it, and might achieve something, but the vast majority of people with ASD (and this is backed up by actual evidence) will achieve almost nothing, and will be miserable for most of their lives.

We should be focusing on a cure, or some kind of pre-natal test with a view toward eradicating this disease. Neurodiversity is sabotaging that effort, and is therefore harmful.

Well, you might be able to, many people can't. Autism can be, and often is, a death sentence. I didn't feel relief when I was diagnosed. First, I didn't believe it, but when I finally did, I knew it was over. This was my life, and I would never be happy.

You can dance around it all you want and say ""it's your attitude!"" but it's not. Because for years after I was diagnosed, I never even accepted that I had this thing. I was convinced I could just force myself to succeed, and do the things I wanted to do. I didn't just think I would succeed, I *knew* I would. But I didn't. At all. Autism took that from me.

That's very interesting, how long ago was that? Environmental factors are very different from a chemical imbalance though. The fact is, we don't know what causes depression. Anyone who said they do, is... well, wrong, to be honest, we just don't know. We know it can have something to do with neurotransmitters, it can have something to do with environmental or lifestyle factors, but we just don't know enough to say ""Depression is caused by X, and fixed by Y"".  If we could, noone would be depressed.

> If we want to frame it as neurodiversity, that’s fine, but depression causes health issues for me.

I'm certainly not suggesting that depression isn't an illness or a health issue! Of course it is. I am actually highly skeptical of the neurodiversity movement (in some ways!) because it can sometimes argue that mental illness is ""normal"". It's not. It's not normal to be depressed, or miserable, or not able to sleep or eat, it's a very serious illness, it's just not caused by a chemical imbalance, it's more complex than that.

The causes and treatments are currently not well understood.

>but that’s not addressing the root problem, which is how to help people who are suffering. I just want it to stop.

That's exactly right, that's exactly the point I am making. Giving someone a half-truth or feel-good story that isn't true is hurting our collective knowledge and understanding of mental illness, and making it harder to find effective treatments.

Many studies indicate that anti-depressants can be (again, in some cases, etc) no more effective than a placebo, but if people adopt a simple ""Chemical imbalance"" theory, they will just take them to ""fix the chemical imbalance"".

>so if your brain is not operating the way it should, that means you are suffering from an illness of the brain.

As I said, the chemical imbalance theory is not correct. Secondly, even if someone was suffering from an ""illness of the brain"", it doesn't mean they are not rational. Someone could be suffering from some kinds of mental health issue, and still make a conscious, rational, choice to end their lives. Not always, but it can happen.

>why I’m suggesting we support finding new effective treatments. 
Absolutely, I agree with that completely.

> to know it’s not my fault and it’s not because I am weak or lack of willpower. 

This is exactly correct, it *isn't* your fault, and you are not weak, nor do you have a lack of willpower. This is one of the reasons why people keep repeating the chemical imbalance theory, and the ""sick brain"" analogy, it *does* help some people to view mental illness in the same way as physical illness. You wouldn't think you were weak if you received treatment for a broken leg, so why would you feel weak for receiving treatment for a ""sick"" brain? In that way, it's a good thing, it helps to remove the stigma from mental health.

The problem is that both of those theories (""your brain is sick"" and ""depression is caused by an imbalance in the brain"") are factually not true. I personally think we can combat mental illness more effectively with truth, rather than feel-good phrases. I suffer from mental illness myself, and I hate being talked down to or told these childish little myths ""Your brain is just a bit sick, you need some special medicine to make it all better again!). Well, it's not nearly that simple."
Frisson,fog1kxp,t1_fofwqjl,1587746536.0,"> Their sick brain kills them.

I'm sorry, I have to just chime in here.

I'm suicidal, and I've heard this ""You don't really want to die, your brain is just sick"" nonsense too many times to not say this.

That's not always true. This is a common myth that's used to dumb down suicide for people who don't understand why someone might want to die.

It may be true for some people in some cases, or many people in many cases, but not everyone who is suicidal irrational, or ""sick"" to the extent that they can't think straight. Some people, maybe a small minority, but some people, are suffering terribly. They might have physical or mental health issues, they might be disabled, etc, etc, and they might genuinely want their life to come to an end. 

This idea that ""their brain is sick"" and they don't know what they're doing is nonsense. What about euthansasia? Would you say that a cancer patient or someone with ALS has a ""sick brain that's trying to kill them""? No, they genuinely want their very real pain to end, and medical science can do no more for them, so they choose to die. That's not irrational.

There aren't always treatments that work. Some people are suffering from chronic conditions that may not be terminal, but have no treatment.

A lot of the time the only ""support"" that the system can offer these people is a few weeks in a psych ward and then a 10 thousand dollar bill. They still have the same issues when they get out."

But there is nothing inherently wrong with porn itself.

It's the same thing as alcohol. Over use, or use by people who are underage, is harmful, but that doesn't mean alcohol is inherently harmful.

To deal with your ""data"":
Number 1, you cited only one source. That's not enough.  Not only that, but that ""source"" is from a site called ""http://endsexualexploitation.org/"". That doesn't sound like an impartial source, now does it? That's like me saying that porn is mostly harmless, and supporting it with a link to pornhub. 

You simply say ""a study"" ""a systematic review"". Which study? Conducted by whom? Reviewed by whom? Who funded it? Why? There's a big difference between a ""study"" conducted by a religious group and one conducted by a national organisation.

Second, the vast majority of the data that you posted concered underage use of porn. I would completely agree that underage use of porn is harmful, *that's why it is illegal*. As I already said, I would support greater checks and balances preventing young people from accessing porn.

There is nothing wrong with a legal, consenting, adult viewing pornographic material in moderation.

Those in the psych industry (and those that aren't) often have a tendency to overestimate the benefits, and underestimate the drawbacks, of antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds.

The fact is (and please, research this, this isn't just my opinion) that most people on SSRI's experience *some* form of weight gain and/or sexual side effects (it may not be a lot, but it's there).

Secondly, in a lot of cases (depending on the study, even most cases) SSRI's are no more effective than a placebo.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172306/

Anti-depressants can work wonders for some, can do nothing for others, and can even cause harmful effects for people. They are powerful drugs, and shouldn't be taken lightly.

Adopting a ""try it and see"" approach also has risks. They take 6-8 weeks to start working, and you can't just stop taking an anti-depressant, you have to be slowly weaned off, your body builds up a dependence on them over time.

I'm not giving any advice, I'm in no way qualified, just be careful, and make sure whatever you decide it's *your* decision, and you have researched it, not just taken the word of one or two people.

That's not true. Even if everything in those article is true, my opinion on PETA's conduct still stands.

None of what you posted does anything to change the fact that PETA stole and killed a healthy family pet, in clear violation of the law (if they had waited five days, as they were required to, the dog would still be alive). If PETA has done this once, how many more times have they done it?

>but use a little critical thinking instead of just jumping on hate bandwagons because it's the in thing.

Actually, it's you that is making assumptions without evidence. I'm not jumping on any bandwagon.

Even if we exclude this incident, PETA has been involved in several very questionable advertising campaigns which have been responsible for inaccurate, often false, information designed to shock people.

For example, I remember one ad campaign where they showed a sheep that had it's skin ripped off, and was covered in blood, and the headline was something like ""How do you like your wool sweater now?"", implying that that's what happens to sheep when they are sheared. Actually, that's not at all true. Sheep are not injured at all when properly sheared, and in fact if they aren't sheared their wool grows too long and can get matted, the sheep can be too hot in the summer, and they can get lice, dirt, etc, in it.

I agree with the stated goals of peta, but they have proven that they have no problem lying and misrepresenting the truth to achieve those goals. They claim to care about animals, but operate kill shelters (questionably ethical) and never even tried to rehome the dogs in the above example. They never even waited five days!

It's not ""jumping on the bandwagon"" to say that PETA is a highly unethical organisation, even if their goals may be noble."

I'm not a lawyer, but I strongly suspect that's not true. If you are going to remove someone pet from their property, and kill it, I believe that you have a legal responsibility to make sure that you are doing that only to the animals that you are supposed to be doing it to. 

In addition, there are different versions of events. In one version:

>The PETA employees backed their van up to the porch and threw biscuits to Maya, who was sitting on her porch, hoping to coax her off her property and give PETA the ability to claim she was a stray dog “at large” whom they could therefore legally impound. In Virginia, PETA is licensed as an “animal shelter.” But Maya refused to stay off the property and after grabbing the biscuit, ran back to the safety of her porch. One of the employees went onto the property and stole Maya

Is it possible that that is not the correct version of events? Sure. Peta has enemies who would want to discredit them. But I have no evidence either way, I think it's quite possible that it is true. There is also, I believe, a video of the incident somewhere.

>And how were they meant to verify when there was no collar or ID? 

That's still their responsibility, and if the dog was on private property, that was enough of a ""doubt"" for them to not take the dog.

>Again, these are FERAL dogs that were attacking neighbors livestock and children, where would they have gone?

The dog that they stole wasn't feral. That's the point.

That's why they have that waiting period, to prevent exactly this type of situation.

>Who's paying to feed and keep them? Why keep them alive for 5 days on a cold, concrete floor and prolong their suffering when they can't be rehomed anyway?

Like I said, to prevent *exactly* this type of situation. Maybe someone made a mistake, maybe someone lost their dog, etc. If peta can't afford to keep the dogs alive for 5 days (at a minimum) then they shouldn't be taking them in the first place. They also shouldn't be on a cold concrete floor, suffering, they should be treated better. If PETA can't afford to do that, again, they shouldn't be taking dogs in the first place.

>Plenty of local animal shelters make admin errors like this and many just euthanize straight away.

Which is equally wrong.

>There are simply not enough homes for every stray dog and feral strays that are attacking children and livestock are not going to have a high rate of adoptability.

That's completely beside the point. If peta had waited five days and euthanised a stray, people wouldn't be nearly as angry. Are people complaining about the other strays they euthanised on that day? No, they are complaining about the family pet that was euthanised, that's the issue. It has nothing to do with feral dogs, it's someones pet.

Not the one that they euthanised."
