basically assault can be as simple as a threat, words and silence can both count as an assault 
for example, if someone was standing outside of someone’s house staring in at them, the person inside is probably going to feel scared that the person is going to try get inside. which makes it threatening so it is liable as an assault.
same goes for telling someone you’re going to beat them up counts as an assault because you have threatened them.
