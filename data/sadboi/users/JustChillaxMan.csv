He proceeds to call her a whore.

These are the so-called cHaMpIoNs Of woMeNs RiGhTs, little keyboard maggots who think they can justify our bodily autonomy by threatening rape on mothers, daughters, sisters and LITTLE BABY GIRLS. Whoever the perp was, he was obviously notified via one of the pro abort tag groups.

You can love your parents but love doesn’t mean staying in a space where you are NOT being loved. Love is not buying your kids or parents items, it is not letting yourself be subject to torture just because we are told we “owe” our parents or spouse or partner. Love allows for distance to happen where healing needs to be dealt with and you need to learn to heal apart from them. Your father has issues and nobody can fix that except him. Don’t allow yourself to be his punching bag further because neither you nor he will be able to heal or come to any realizations. Same with your mother, because he broke her too."

Then she and her mother looked into each other’s eyes and her mother told her not to be sad anymore because she was in “the place of refuge” and that she was home now. She said they smiled at each other and her mother started doing a new dance in front of her to show her that she was joyful now.
