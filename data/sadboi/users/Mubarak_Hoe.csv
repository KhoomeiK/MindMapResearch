exmuslim,fkq40r4,t1_fkoewfn,1584429605.0,I feel exactly the same way. It’s taking me a lot of time to find a purpose too. It badly ruined my mental health. I think being kind to yourself as you look for a purpose is really important. Being an exmoose is really isolating and lonely and scary so it’s important to keep yourself well taken care of.

exmuslim,fkkyka4,t3_fizfml,1584294665.0,I’m 21. Exmuslim female from Pakistan. I’ve been exmuslim for 2 years . My parents aren’t very strict regarding religion which is why I feel safe but it’s still tough living a closeted life. You can’t be very open about your life and beliefs to anyone and it gets suffocating.

polyadvice,fjmwd8r,t3_fdozcn,1583487280.0,"Jealousy can be overcome. Read books working on how to combat jealousy for open relationships. 
I'm in the same boat as you kind of. Found my soulmate but they are poly.

 Its helpful to think of it as friendship. If your partner was your friend and they hung out with their partner as a friend too you wouldn't be jealous because we're ok with having multiple friendships in society. Think of it the same way as with your partner and multiple romantic relationships.  

This isnt a starvation economy. Your partner loving another shouldn't subtract from the love they are giving to you. If it does then you're probably doing it wrong. There is enough love to go around. I read about this concept of abundant love in The Ethical Slut.

You owe it to your parnter to do your research. I think its a total act of love to be willing to learn new things for your partner. 

Another added bonus is that your metamour can be your friend and your parnter having experience with another person will make your life with your partner richer because they'll know newer things and will be more evolved. Also Poly parenting sounds like a lot of fun and support.

These are some of the ways i started thinking differently after self education that helped me lean towards being poly. I'm still learning and not completely to the side of poly yet but i went from being very insecure to being ok with my partner having another. I hope this helps you too.



(My partner still hasnt found another partner so only time will tell how ill react to my partner dating another. But for now theoretically I'm at ease.)"
