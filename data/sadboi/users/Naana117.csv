AskWomen,fhbhxd0,t1_fhapakv,1581442645.0,"An adult takes responsibilities for a child’s mistake. Consequences are bared by adult responsible. When you’re an adult, ofcourse you have the sense of responsibility and it automatically becomes your fault and your fault only. So yeah. I totally agree with you."
AskWomen,fhbhc83,t1_fhbbh52,1581442305.0,"I learned the hard way that its always you that decides to lift you up and get yourself out of that shit that you’re drowning yourself in. And the power of not giving up in hardships lies in stopping all complaining that we do about it and rather finding solutions or somewhat fair ground to accept and let go of things. Life isn’t easy and not everything will turn out the way you want and not everyone would treat you the way you want. Harsh truth like this needs to be accepted and embraced. Also the more you respect yourself, the more others respect you."
depression,fh8p6eb,t1_fe4l8qg,1581364487.0,"I feel exactly the same a lot of times. I’ve had this bad experience of people handling my sensitivity way out of proportion too many times. Now I feel like explaining how I feel to someone should never be done as it would not be their business at all or they wouldn’t care or might even use it against me somehow. The fear of not being understood makes you suppress a lot of what you want to express. I’ve entirely lost any way of communicating to people on how I am doing everyday now, even if I am barely going through the day. Feels so hopeless."

Keeps you away from all the bs people purposefully post or unknowingly post as welll. Basically, life gets much better I swear. I am still active on the few groups that are special for me."
AskMen,fh8ly4s,t3_f1m4fl,1581362544.0,"Here’s mine. 

1. The urge to just throw my fully filled glass water bottle on to the staircase. 
2. Randomly grab someones hair and start a fight
3. Sudden urge to run on a good day while walking to your lunch or breakfast while in office attire."
