relationship_advice,fbkvrux,t1_fbkuzeg,1576955786.0,yeah you‚Äôre probably right. i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôll be brave enough to say it face to face but i think it‚Äôs best
relationship_advice,fbkspa1,t1_fbkquwd,1576955006.0,we are quite physically close. as a person she‚Äôs not too into physical touch but we hug a lot and if we‚Äôre sitting on a couch together (such as the common room at school) she puts her legs across my lap. we were also dancing pretty close at a concert last week. I‚Äôm so worried i‚Äôm reading it all wrong
relationship_advice,fbkrkx3,t1_fbkq5vj,1576954596.0,We are out of school for two weeks. I really don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd broach the subject though. Is face to face best?
AmItheAsshole,fbelmwm,t3_ecysfs,1576788446.0,"YTA, seriously, she‚Äôs 12 years old. most 12 year olds don‚Äôt even babysit and it‚Äôs pretty mature of her to want to go out and make a bit of spending money for herself. if you were trying to teach her how to save money that‚Äôd be a different story but you‚Äôre literally just taking it from her. taking it from her piggy bank in her room after she clearly didn‚Äôt want to hand it over is low too and you basically just showed her that stealing is okay so long as you have authority over the person you‚Äôre stealing from. she will learn about tax eventually but it‚Äôs absolutely not something she needs to be taught in such a harsh way at 12 years old. give her that money back and apologise you mean asshole."

AmItheAsshole,falqu2s,t3_e9ugwv,1576188917.0,"NTA but make sure you prepare the 5 yr old and explain everything that‚Äôs happening as best you can to them. Don‚Äôt treat it as a sad occasion, reassure the kid that it‚Äôs a good thing that the foster child is going back to their family and that they will be happy."

AmItheAsshole,f9fnmoe,t3_e4wqhw,1575280792.0,"ESH, they shouldn‚Äôt hurt you and tease you but at the same time there‚Äôs much better ways you can deal with it than saying you want to kill them. Talk to someone you trust please and as an 18yo I can assure you that 14 is a really tough age to be and even though it might not be showing, all of your classmates are going through a hard time too. It gets better."
ireland,f96oczu,t1_f95o4st,1575148856.0,Transgender is pretty much medically defined by gender dysphoria alone. Most trans people would describe themselves as being born in the wrong body as that‚Äôs the way gender dysphoria makes a person feel.
ireland,f96nx2u,t1_f961gni,1575148658.0,Thanks for clarifying this! Sophia is an inspirational kid and I‚Äôm delighted to see so much support for them <3
ireland,f9593w7,t1_f956b80,1575122303.0,Was she trans though? She spoke about the bullies making fun of her hair but neither she or Ryan mentioned that she was trans. However I did notice Ryan using gender neutral language around her (eg: he described her as a unique person rather than unique girl).

feemagers,f5hr2hi,t3_dnoujz,1572207144.0,there actually is! I collected american girl doll stuff from 2011-2017 and there is quite a large community of adult and teen collectors. Most of them do look for the dolls that are discontinued (your isabelle doll is) so that does add some value depending on the dolls condition. There is also a market for dolls that are not in such good condition as there are some collectors who use these dolls for parts or for making custom dolls.
