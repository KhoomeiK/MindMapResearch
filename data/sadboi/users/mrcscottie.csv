CallOfDutyMobile,fmi90u7,t3_fvgkos,1586104845.0,"1. Those guns aren’t “very hard to master.” The msmc maybe takes a little getting used to but that’s all.
2. They weren’t perfect counters to the s36 because neither of them had good range and s36 excelled at long ranges.
3. I don’t think the asm10 is an easy gun that any beginner can use because its slow fire rate is very unforgiving if you miss shots.
4. Try out the RUS79 (or even pdw); it’s a great gun that can easily take out asm10 if you strafe or jump while in a gun fight.
5. If a gun is OP (asm10), why would you think the solution is to buff other guns to make them OP? The solution is nerfing the OP gun.
6. In higher ranks, people tend to not play the meta as much (in my experience). Last season, you would get roasted by both teams if you used an s36 in legendary. This season, I hardly see anyone using asm10, because the feeling of using a broken gun isn’t super fun"
