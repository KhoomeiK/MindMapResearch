I can still get very much suicidal while on them which I'm not sure is normal. I took them for a long time cuz I try to be optimistic I guess, so I just kept getting my dose upped and tryna wait things out till I wasn't so sad anymore. hasn't rlly happened haha"
depression,fbwdlws,t1_fbwbgk0,1577147137.0,"yeah but I started taking em about 8 months ago and don't have the slightest idea who I was before that point; my memory has been terrible, which may be a side effect in and of itself haha"

depression,fbwamga,t1_fbwagmy,1577144920.0,okay but I get suicidal thoughts regardless. I kinda think they might be even more prevalent on the meds
depression,fbwajnn,t1_fbwadib,1577144863.0,yeah but I've been there before and I feel like if I just push thru and remind myself why it's happening and how it may actually better me (similarly to how 'getting used to' meds sucks) I could like heal. like what if I'm past the real shit idk.
depression,fbwa8t5,t1_fbwa2qv,1577144639.0,but whyyy what if meds are just another government conspiracy to actually further control the population lmao

It can kinda make me feel numb, but a good, invincible numb; not too-depressed-to-feel-anymore numb. I like to think of antidepressants to depression as morphine, etc. is to physical pain - the pain is still there, but it's more bearable now."

prozac,f83jpe9,t1_f821k7h,1574213554.0,"I'm the same way. Depends who I'm around or  what I have so it's kinda a gamble; sometimes drinking makes me much happier and more sociable while others I get to my most suicidal and driven by despair. Just be careful, basically. Be around ppl who make you feel safe and drink fairly gradually, cuz in my experience w prozac I'm a much bigger lightweight."
depression,f83jd3u,t1_f818kop,1574213330.0,"I'm not sure where the root lies, but it seems to be hormonally-based or seasonal which gives me a bit of hope.

And when I get suicidal I'm pushed very very hard and become overwhelmed enough that I lose sight of absolutely everything else."

AmItheAsshole,f804u21,t3_dy33fl,1574120899.0,"NAH, but you should still apologize. Spiritual beliefs are a huge part of some people's lives and not to be belittled imo. And like you said, going to church means a lot to her. I understand couples with differing religious mindsets, but it worries me a lil longterm cuz often it's like the foundation on which your life is set upon; makin it kinda risky to be with someone when you're not compatible in such a huge way."
aspergers,f7xsp3a,t1_f7xr3dw,1574073449.0,"yeah lmao I prob shoulda mentioned that but didn't wanna be too wordy :)
- I've always felt 'different' from other people
- have specific strong interests
- very strong negative emotions, sometimes about things that don't bother other ppl
- can easily overload senses
- had a lot of trouble understanding what I did wrong when I was a bit younger
- might think faster than average (??) but kinda miss out on social aspects
- very blunt and don't rlly care about having a filter
- older sister who is a psych nurse said I seem autistic
- grandpa on my dad's side likely had autism, and I believe he could too
- love dark, obscure humour
- used to hate hate hate certain materials and feelings as a kid

*prob important to note i'm only 17, so some things can be explained simply by that

also not totally sure how, but I've either 'grown out of' ocd, intense anxiety, etc. a bit or just learned to cope better over time"
OCD,f7kgjyh,t3_dwn0i2,1573809105.0,"I'm sorry man :( I used to game hard till compulsions affected it eventually. like the other guy said you have to cut back and not give into the unnecessary actions you're pushed to do. ik it's rlly hard, best of luck xx"
OCD,f7kfyu4,t3_dwn2ht,1573808190.0,exposure to things you're scared of is good imo dude !! to each their own but I find the memes kinda rad cuz I heavily dig dark humour and laughing at things that have caused me pain in any way. I'm happy other ppl can relate to this disorder that usually has the power to separate me as weird â˜†
OCD,f7kfk1z,t3_dwn9p4,1573807571.0,"OCD is an anxiety disorder that causes turmoil as a result of our failure to accept imperfection. everyone experiences insecurity and self-consciousness, but as ppl with OCD we are predisposed to have a harder time with it. personally, I've always had much difficulty as a teenage girl in anything to do with my appearance; of course this is entirely normal as an adolescent, but where it crossed the line is when that OCD-oriented obsession caused me to spend hours in the bathroom fixating and redoing things no one else would notice, cry/panic, or just forget leaving the house at all. I think differentiation between regular behaviour and that OCD turmoil is found in the self-awareness your actions/thoughts are illogical, but they remain intrusive in the feeling you must complete them. or, in your case, they interrupt your daily life and cause unnecessary stress. so...

TL;DR yes I believe it's OCD related. I hope you realize or remember again soon that you're beautiful, and the mere shell of what really determines your beauty is only temporary and should not dictate your life in any way :)"
OCD,f7kesir,t3_dwmsps,1573806406.0,"I can heavily relate to carrying an unrelenting burden of guilt, self-doubt, etc.
what usually helps me in dwelling on the past is just to remember:
- you can't change what you did but you can learn from mistakes to improve your present self
- everybody else worries about their image just as much as you, enough that they very likely don't remember your embarrassments
- how we judge other ppl in their bad moments is not nearly as harsh as we often judge ourselves"
OCD,f7kdy4k,t3_dwjy8p,1573805202.0,"I've been able to wash my hands a bit less by:

- tricking myself by washing my hands for a bit longer each time to 'feel' cleaner
- allowing myself to wash only in certain situations (before eating, after getting home from somewhere or using the bathroom)
- using my sleeve on doorknobs or things many other ppl touch
- avoiding my mouth or face during the day
- reminding myself it rids of good bacteria and lower exposure to germs = weaker immunity to illness"
OCD,f7kdd1c,t3_dwjffs,1573804394.0,I've added a ritual of moisturizing in the morning before school and before bed to combat this :)
