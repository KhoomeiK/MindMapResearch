Then my boyfriend was killed in a car accident and I instantly became obsessed with what happens? Where do we go? And the most important to me, will I ever get to see him again? I don't know what's worse, the thought of death just being the end or the thought of never seeing my loved ones again. I eventually talked to what I guess some people would call a ""medium"", except he was nothing like the typical medium...a friend gave me his number, he rarely had service so he didn't call me back for a week, he didn't want money and didn't even give me his name because he was kind of embarrassed by all of it and didn't like people knowing. My friend told him I was in a dark place and needed some help. It was awkward at first and I felt stupid (and extremely skeptical)and he made clear he didn't even know if he could communicate, or whatever with my boyfriend, but he did and it was nothing like the long island medium or any of those people(not that I don't like them, but I'm on the fence about them) whatever happened, he was absolutely communicating with him, and it really brought me some peace and set in stone for me that death is not the end.  Since then, I've lost more loved ones, including my mom very unexpectedly.  A week before she passed she said she dreamt she was with her mom and grandmother(who had passed) and was just having a great visit with them, in a beautiful place, and she said she'd never felt so at peace and good about things, and was disappointed when she woke up because she wanted to stay.  It was a lot like that YouTube video that young man made about his NDE right before he passed away, and multiple other NDE experiences I've read about, not exactly, but similar. I have no doubt that's where she's at, or at least that's where she went. I feel like reincarnation plays into things, I have no idea how(and hope if it does we get to choose lol)

I think the brain chemicals theory is something they came up with because they needed an explanation for themselves and I completely understand that.  But when it comes down to it, there are things that can't and won't ever be explained and when I don't overthink it(lol) I like that.

AskReddit,f9iixgw,t1_f9i8arp,1575338262.0,Really? This is on my top ten for loling!
AskReddit,f9iit5v,t3_e55v5l,1575338178.0,"Also- "" Dude where's my car"" . Seriously the absolute dumbest movie I've ever seen."
AskReddit,f9iikfg,t3_e55v5l,1575338010.0,"""Whores Glory"" a documentary that was on Netflix about prostitutes around the world. Was really shocking to see what some people have to do just to survive...left me with a lot of questions about why some of us are born into good circumstances and some horrible. It was just too disturbing."
AskReddit,f9iibo6,t1_f9i6a3p,1575337841.0,"Forgot about this one too,which is odd because I think of it every so often. I don't think I could stomach it again either."
AskReddit,f9ihrag,t1_f9i404l,1575337443.0,"I forgot about that one,it was depressing. Too bad to, because I love the cast."
AskReddit,f9icv9f,t1_f9huiyy,1575333965.0,"This is true! I mean,when it's like ""American pie"" (the movie) fast it can be frustrating,but for the most part I've always taken it as a compliment."
AskReddit,f9ibrbu,t1_ext67a8,1575333162.0,"Im sure it's weird, but you have been coming across my mind,so I just thought I'd say that I hope your new job/new home is everything you hoped it would be me and you and your family have a wonderful holiday season"
AskReddit,f4o2xnd,t1_f4nnlbh,1571695752.0,"You're absolutely right. If there is no custody plan yet though,they can do whatever they want. When I first left my ex-husband he got drunk and took off with our 3 children on horses...he also left multiple voicemails on my phone about how he was going to kill me. We were in a very tiny town and the cops told me because we had no custody agreement yet,he could take them to Mexico or anywhere else if he wanted and there was nothing I could do. Had it not been for the death threats he left they wouldn't have done anything."
AskReddit,f4o123v,t1_f4nd1nr,1571695120.0,That is so heartbreaking. I'm so sorry. I hope you guys have found peace
