I've had tons of free time during this Coronavirus stuff and have just gotten back into World of Warcraft (which is a total time sink I know). Definitely have to keep it in check, as to not become dependent on it. However it is helping me cope. When I'm playing, I don't dwell on my shitty life as much. An easy dopamine rush as you said.

The difficult part is arts and hobbies and such. For example, I used to love piano. All my life and through my teens I played piano and making music. I also enjoyed photography to some degree and stuff. The issue is that depression destroys that. I haven't really played the piano in 2 years. I've tried so hard to get back into it but it just makes me more frustrated than anything. 

The same with any other hobbies. Nothing is fun anymore. Depression ruins interests and hobbies (making them frustrating and boring) and halts progression. Same with college and stuff. I have no career goals because I don't want to ANYTHING. I hate everything.
