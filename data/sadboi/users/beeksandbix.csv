[Small Victories](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Victories-Recipes-Hundreds-Triumphs-ebook/dp/B01ESHXURK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2BIIW5TLY7EOR&dchild=1&keywords=julia+turshen+small+victories&qid=1589408284&sprefix=julia+turshen%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-1) by Julia Turshen - Julia's writing style is great, like a down to earth Ina, and she does amazing things to make the food world more inclusive. I use her meatball recipe at least once a month (freezable!) and her yogurt pancakes with roasted fruit even have the blessing of my picky boyfriend.

The writers, the artists, the Caroline Calloway types, who get to depend on their family money if they fail. I’m salty because that is not my reality, but oh well. 

I definitely believe that Chrissy’s PR team is who is responsible for capitalizing on her hobby and turning into what it today. She was a model first, and on that second act and this is what it is. She has her husband’s money to fall back on also - just more obvious so that she doesn’t have to talk about it or chose to talk about it. Roman alluded in her tweets that she was just being honest about money while she’s right to do so, she didn’t have to tear down others."
blogsnark,fq2usvs,t3_ggkrwl,1589059962.0,"Look, I’m a devotee to NYT Cooking and have love some Alison Roman even before she was a columnist there. I like her approach of simple but meaningful recipes and her style in general. She has influenced me to make certain recipes and a dedicated nail color (Essie Geranium). 

But her mean girl tendencies are well documented throughout her career. A few months ago, she dissed food bloggers for creating content that makes her job harder because so much is out there already. She talks a lot about how her methods are superior or how “she’ll never made you do ___ because it’s pointless” when so many other people do it this way. And how dumb do you have to be to go after Chrissy Tiegen who has a hive of followers and who actually does cooking and social media really well (sometimes grating but still). I think of her as the Target of basic internet b’s - like somewhere/thing that everyone lo0o0o0ves. Fitting with her line at Target. 

I would also like to highlight Roman’s background as my own personal annoyance with her and others like her. I know she dropped out or has some college background to start cooking and following her passions. I also know (from a long time of following her) that her dad is an LA doctor. I love people growing their own empires, etc. (huge listener of How I Built This) and just hate how many people have the privilege of doing whatever they want to do because they have a safety net behind them. She might have started at the bottom of the restaurant totem pole and worked her way up, but I never see her talk about how that safety net allowed her to do these things. And that is how I feel about a lot of the ~writers and artists living in Brooklyn~ type that she definitely falls in. It must be so nice and definitely freeing to live in a life with no debt!!

blogsnark,fk4nopj,t1_fk40fop,1583864032.0,"I FEEL THIS.

My boyfriend is insanely unhealthy due to his picky eating. I consider myself a foodie and love cooking and eating new things. He does have some childhood trauma tied to food which I am totally mindful of, but he very much treats food as just something we need to survive. He would be happiest eating wings and pizza every night of the week instead of real vegetables and nutrients. 

It's hard, frustrating, and honestly bums me out. How I sometimes long for partner who I can go on sushi dates with and who I don't have to ask if the menu is okay before going to a new restaurant. But, he is the man I love and is relentlessly supportive and is at least willing to try to work on his food stuff with me. He also is the biggest cheerleader in me getting excited to cook new things (weird since he eats almost none of it).

We've been living together for almost 6 months now and while I wish progress was better, we're starting to find an okay balance between making food. I've switched almost all our ground beef to chicken or turkey and he barely notices. If he wants to eat a burger/meatballs, we'll make our patties, and I'll eat mine with lettuce. With pasta, I'll make a sauce and he'll eat it with noodles and I'll eat it over roasted vegetables. We allow ourselves at least one night where we can eat separately so that I can still make scallops or whatever and he can eat chicken nuggets. 

It's hard to find a compromise, but we're working on it. Since we both are trying, it's easier to meet in the middle. I have found that ground meat recipes are easy to adapt to either side. One success I've had is a riff on the [PF Chang's Lettuce Wraps](https://damndelicious.net/2014/05/30/pf-changs-chicken-lettuce-wraps/) \- using less hoisin and soy and adding a lot of garlic, ginger, cilantro, and red bell peppers - and he can eat it with rice or as tacos and I eat them as lettuce wraps."

Anyway, on the news, I saw a Frank Lloyd House on sale for crazy cheap, because the neighborhood is terrible, but a 75/100 property and violent crime rate isn't terrible, right??? Adding an hour to my + my boyfriend's commute wouldn't be the end of the world, right??

My niece's birthday party this weekend and I'm a little homesick for her and her sister, so I am very excited to spend a weekend with family and being the cool auntie."

A friend got married, had a super chill wedding, only had 4 bridesmaids. In her close friend group, it was a group of 5 and she left out 2 of them. One of the friends who is a little bit... extreme and who at the bachelorette party kept talking about how she didn't feel miffed at about not being a bridesmaid... and then went to the wedding in a dress that was the exact shade of purple and the exact silhouette as the bridesmaids. She acted like it was a total mistake and that she was embarrassed but who wears a floor length purple dress to a backyard-style wedding in the middle of summer?"

For Hawaiian-ish food, I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend checking out Aloha Wagon on Western. It's unassuming and small with more of a carryout situation, but combines Hawaiian, Filipino, and Mexican food. Their fish and pork tacos are perfection and could even be in my top 3 of the city.

I bought *Things We Lost in the Fire: Stories* by Mariana Enriquez over the summer and am now getting to reading it. Dark horror short stories that are well written and set in Argentina. I'm a few stories in and am loving it, if you like Shirley Jackson, I'd check it out!"

I personally have been feeling very ""your life is now and you haven't gone out of the country in years and that's something you said you would do as an adult and you are not.""
