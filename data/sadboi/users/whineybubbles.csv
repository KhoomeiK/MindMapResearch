Kelsey Goeres | MORE ARTICLES
May 16, 2020

90 Day Fiancé fans got to see Cortney Reardanz again on 90 Day Fiancé: Self-Quarantined. In the new spinoff of the show, she’s with a man named Andy who she first referred to as her “friend.” Apparently, they’re still not on the same page.


“Andy from the show, I feel that he’s ready for marriage and a relationship and stuff and I felt, ‘OK, I’m getting to know him. I’m exploring my options,’ or I wasn’t ready for commitment,” she told The Domenick Nati Show on May 15.

Cortney says she’s still trying to figure out where exactly they stand.

“Like we text and talk but I feel there’s been a lot of arguing so I don’t know if we’re compatible or if it’s just the stress of quarantine. So I feel I’m sorting out my love life. It’s a mess,” she said.

Cortney Reardanz drank while filming ’90 Day Fiancé’ because she ‘was so shy’

Cortney also revealed in the interview that she would drink alcohol before and during filming to help with her nerves.

“Honestly I was drunk as f*ck on the show because I was so shy and nervous. I was like drinking before filming, all through filming, like I was just so nervous and it made me more talkative or get out of my head. But the producer was sitting like six or seven feet away from me so I’d have to like stare at him and answer questions and I think it was difficult when I was drunk,” she said.



Cortney says, looking back, “that was probably a mistake.” But a mistake she’d gladly make again.

“Would I do it again? Yeah. You guys saw on the quarantine show I was drunk, too,” she said.

Cortney’s thoughts on the current ’90 Day Fiancé’ season and David and Lana

Cortney says she’s been watching the current season but she’s unimpressed.

“I feel every season is kind of the same storyline–‘Oh is this person gonna show up or no?’ And then the person always ends up showing up, you know? But I’m surprised they dragged it all the way to the very end,” she said.



Cortney specifically shared her thoughts concerning David and Lana. She thinks “that really is Lana.”

“Honestly, I don’t feel she speaks English because when she filmed, she was doing her whole segment in Russian. So I think she’s probably like confused. But I’m sure they paid her a lot of money to do the show. That’s why she probably finally agreed to do it. I’m curious if he did two flights there because like they didn’t meet and then they flew home then he flew back. So I’m curious if he actually did two flights. Of if they just filmed it to make it look like he did that,” she said.

“But it seems like that would have been too much a hassle to put on a different outfit and film in the plane again so maybe he was just there one time,” added Cortney.

90 Day Fiancé: Self Quarantine airs on TLC Mondays at 9 p.m.

'Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta' Star Charged With Fraud After Obtaining $2M PPP Pandemic Loan

￼



Maurice Fayne allegedly used more than $1.5 million on jewelry and child support, according to authorities.

Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta star Maurice Fayne, aka Arkansas Mo, on Wednesday was charged with federal bank fraud, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
The 37-year-old Fayne of Dacula, Georgia, who appeared on nine episodes of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta in season eight, obtained a Paycheck Protection Program loan in the name of a trucking company, but allegedly spent the funds on himself. Fayne made his initial court appearance Wednesday. 
The charge stems from Fayne obtaining the PPP loan for a Georgia corporation he called Flame Trucking. The former reality TV star was able to secure a loan for more than $2 million, saying it was for his payroll. However, he allegedly used more than $1.5 million on jewelry, including a Rolex Presidential watch, a diamond bracelet and a 5.73 carat diamond ring for himself. Fayne also is accused of using the federal funds to play $40,000 in child support, according to authorities."
