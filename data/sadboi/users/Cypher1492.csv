It's usually a specialty taken in graduate studies up here at universities and is quite different from theological programs offered at the Bible colleges.  Maybe that isn't the case where you are from and that is why you are only familiar with one method of Bible study. Theology is the study of God. Biblical studies is the study of the Bible as a text including topics such as authorship, history, culture, language, as well as the study of non-Biblical text that relate to the Bible.  

An example might be:

Theology asks, ""What does Genesis tell us about God's character?""

Academia asks, ""What did the author(s) of Genesis intend to convey to the reader?""
