The album is the first album they made since ""License To Ill"" (one of the best hip-hop records ever made, mind you) that really felt like they had fully detached from the party boy tropes of the aforementioned album and started to pave their own unique, creative, and downright impressive path into alternative hip-hop. It's arguably not as consistent as Ill Communication, but I have a soft spot for the album for a lot of reasons. A lot of the Beastie Boys best songs are on here (Professor Booty, Gratitude, So Whatcha Want, Funky Boss, Jimmy James, etc) and it really is the point where they started to sound like an innovative group, even though Paul's Boutique is one of the best sendoffs for 80's styled rap. thoughts?"

I asked her about Adderall and she told me that it’s definitely stronger, but it’s more expensive than a bump in dosage with a generic brand Concerta, even with insurance.

I like the Glow Part 2, and I mostly can't stand Trout Mask Replica, but I respect its place in the history of music and how Cap and his band managed to translate their torturous experience making the album into what could be called ""music"".
