two physics professors who argue that QM does a disservice by not exploring the theoretical implications of QM, and then exploring the theoretical implications of QM

i do not agree that anyone who knows anything about QM does not try to connect it to consciousness but rather the zeitgeist and stigmas regarding such things prevent productive explorations. regardless of where your belief lies we do not know what causes wave function collapse nor what the far reaching theoretical implications of the behavior found in QM implies. 

that being said there is a whole shit ton of nonsense and trying to connect dots in ways that make no sense w/in the framework of QM by idiots and new age woo people who exploit lack of understanding. do your due diligence and research so that you can call out hte bullshit and stick to the theories and ideas that align with reality"

askphilosophy,fqcwctv,t1_fqcmtb9,1589271182.0,"*something* still collapses the wave function, even in the Copenhagen interpretation. we do not know what causes the wave function to collapse but since science is dogmatically materialist it is touted as ""measurement"" and explorations into the theoretical implications of of QM are discouraged and physicists are told to shut up and do the math. 

As a general rule, I don't think it's a good idea to base a whole philosophical view on a physical view that is maintained as a True Fact of Existence (materialism) without actual intellectual scrutiny, and perhaps probably wrong."

who decides what meaning is true or not? why does a meaning have to be universal to be true?

i work with 2 nurse practitioners and have found them to be just as good, if not better, than pdocs. 

latuda saved my life and has been the only med that touched my depression. however, it's not FDA approved to treat manic episodes. It actually causes hypomania or mania in me if i stay on my winter dose (when i get more depressed) during the springtime. It really is a miracle for depression though and evens me out and makes me feel stable. 

be warned it can cause akathisia which is it's own brand of hell and torment. 

it is prohibitively expensive and that is one reason you might want to try something else. my rx would cost 1.8k to get filled. when i had insurance after my deductible the price dropped to 1.7k. i buy from canada.

keep in mind you are just starting out. you aren't going to just take the pill and be better. i don't want to discourage you but it took me 7 years to find a combination of meds that worked for me. even still its an ever-changing process of med management. i highly suggest you seek out therapy."

i understand that objectively and scientifically for things to be valid there needs to be 1. empirical evidence 2. replicability 3. falsifiability, but this all works on the assumption that knowledge is equal to faith and that faith falls under the same umbrella as standard epistemic assumptions about knowledge. 

not what would it take you to *know* because you know how we come to know things. what would it take you to *believe*. the path to belief and faith, to me, also requires evidentiary backing of a different sort and i believe working through the medium of gaining knowledge empirically if you are dueling with the metaphyiscal only serves to reinforce materialistic conceptions of existence when you hold faith to an epistemic standard it is not meant to be held to. 

even though i am a rational mystic, what turns me off about a lot of peoples religious faith and metaphysical beliefs are the knowledge claims they make without understanding that they cant actually know these things and the lack of proper epistemic framing surrounded facts, faith, knowledge and belief.

to believe in jesus, god itself would have to make me a virgin again and get me pregnant with the second coming of jesus. 

it would be difficult to impossible to get me to believe in the god of the old testament, allah or xenu."
AvPD,fgfzk8o,t3_ey8hxr,1580751023.0,"I feel the same way a lot of the time. I used to wonder why i was allowed to exist when i didnt have the proper coping mechanisms people seem to need for existence.

it sucks and i dont know what to tell you. its hard to function in a social front-facing world when you are like us. i am still trying to figure out how i can best function in this world (career wise/support myself) and not be miserable but i am luckier than most that i have that luxury. i wish i could be more helpful."
KUWTK,fgfz84o,t3_ey9r36,1580750817.0,"it is my belief that any amount of ""caring"" they do about issues is posturing used to manipulate their image, so it stands that their actions don't align with what they purport to support."
AskReddit,fgeznq6,t3_ey2of6,1580716747.0,a certain man whose smelly existence put me in heat. it was the most intoxicating smell i have ever smelled in my life. being around him was maddening. i used to wish he would not have time to shower and have to walk in the sun before we met up so he smelled. i wrote more poems about that mans smell than i have any other subject. i have never met anyone else or any other scent that made me insane the way his smell did. it was debilitating.

religion,ffdky0g,t3_et0bns,1579823073.0,"i'm an exmormon, but mormonism teaches that god created ""worlds without number"" and that the earth is not the only planet inhabited. 

“And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose. …""

“But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.""

So mormonism allows for the existence of life on other planets, but they are all subject to the same god. In conjunction, all planets with intelligent life are believed to be saved by jesus' atonement. 

So, there are worlds without numbers, inhabited currently and some that used to be inhabited but they are all god's creation and all the inhabitants can be saved by jesus (who somehow ended up on earth.) 

hell if i know how ET's would learn about jesus."
quantummechanics,ffakad0,t3_esk7dc,1579737843.0,"tastes change and people don't make decisions extremely linearly like in your examples. i don't know why you think you can casually map actions so simply, for one. 

secondly, for true determinism to exist you'd have to be able to map out every atoms position casually providing a cascade of events from the beginning of the universe until you decided to lie or eat an ice cream.

QM gives a statistical probability of position but not a clear cut position, allowing for the interpretation that things aren't 100% determined (ignoring hidden variable theories)."
