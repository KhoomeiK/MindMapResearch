autism,fr4pb0r,t1_fr4ifcd,1589894049.0,"they gave us qualifications for three subjects instead of the usual (in the uk) ten, they would only let us do foundation meaning the highest we could get was a C (since i left that high school i've had impeccable grades not to stroke my ego but im making a point), they were deaming, they degraded us on a daily basis, we were completely isolated from our peers and came out with no way to interact with them, we'd face constant abuse from the teachers, we'd be punished for minor transgressions by being locked in a small room all day and brought a cup of water and a very small portion of whatever lunch was on offer, we were banned from bringing any kind of entertaiment into school (consoles, instruments, BOOKS), and once someone brought in a fairground toy out of sheer boredom, her choice was to either be put in isolation for the day or throw the toy in the bin. they laid hands on us. they locked us outside in the yard in winter without coats on as punishment. the more violent pupils would assault lower-functioning students on a regular basis and the staff did nothing. i watched as one of the kids choked-out a non-verbal kid and watched the teaching assistant do nothing. so my friends and i would be the ones to break up fights. and we'd be punished for it. when i was given the option to do a fourth gcse i was told i couldnt apply by the deputy head teacher because ""no one in this school would be able to handle a fourht gcse"", again, bullshit, as i've mentioned above. the staff would find out our triggers and bring them up just or fun. i remember one of the non-verbal kids quietly working on his puzzles, as happy as you could be, and one of the staff leans over and says ""you've been very naughty, we're going to tell your mum you've been bad and she's going to punish you"" the kid starts crying and freaking out, obviously, because he hasn't done naythign wrong. the staff member just laughs. i asked her ""waht the hell did you do that for?"" and i was given Yard Punishment. We weren't given proper sex education, despite people being in that high school until 18. They built a sensory room to bring kids to calm down but once we were in there all we could do was sit and do nothing in case we broke anything in a room full of pillows. God there's too much to write down there's enough to fill a novel, but I'll leave you with the highlights for now. Shit honey there might have been worse, but tbh I've blocked most of that shit from my memory. I attended this school from 2010-2015. This is not ancient history, believe you me."

If you put shepard's pie in front of me as a kid I would manage a few fork-fulls then throw up on the floor. But if someone offered me an alternative I knew I could eat, that was what I would get. If you know he can safely eat bacon, sausages, and beans, he gets bacon, sausages and beans. There's a world of difference between forcing something down a kids throat that's going to make them sick, and treating them like a patron at a restaurant. From what OP says, she struck exactly the right balance between the two."

It sounds like I have the same food problem as the kid and it can be tough, but even at 5 years old I understood that I can't just have whatever I want whenever, and if there was something I could eat that was available, I would eat it. Refusing to give any other options would be one thing, but you gave him several options, which included food you know he likes, so his condition isn't the problem here, the problem is he hasn't been told ""no"" so it seems he's incapable of processing it has a concept. You did the right thing and the kid will be better off when he realises meal times don't revolve around him.

It's not just about the ""damn nuggets"", it's about raising a child and teaching him how to exist in the world without having everything he wants just handed to him on a silver platter.

YTA. Read your own post and try to imagine you would react if literally anyone but you made it. This isn't the worst thing I've read by far and it should be pretty easy to make up for it, but it's your attitude that's the problem.

a) taking something your bf made without sharing

b) disregarding his personal time, ESPECIALLY since he's going out and working, he deserves to have as much leisure time as he can

c) demeaning his hobbies. i don't care if he spends it g a m i n g or sewing sock puppet, it's his hobby and you have no right to use it as an excuse for your own selfishness

d) lying to him. you didnt eat a lot of the cake, you ate ALL the cake. again this is so funny cause its so trivial, but its your own response thats troubling.

e) telling him he can't be upset with you because you're pregnant. yes he should be delicate and patient and understanding, but you can't expect him to be understanding if you don't even understand what you did wrong YOURSELF

f) calling him lazy?! ""sitting on his ass all day."" he's going out to work during a fucking pandemic, he bakes (mostly for you, it seems), made a child's birthday cake, and he jogs as well. he seems a hell of a lot more productive than most people right now!

g) i don't think you're manipulating him, you don't seem like a mean person, but the way you're talking it seems like you just want him to forgive you for ""not being able to help yourself"".that's selfish.

h) refusing to take responsibility. you are not a toddler. you CAN help yourself. even a 6 year old knows that

i) oh yeah, and stealing from a six year old. i don't need to go on any further.

Overall, besides stealing from the child, you're not a complete asshole, you just need to take responsibility for the mistake you made. Like you said, it really isn't the worst crime in the world, so it should be easy for you to own up to. I'm sorry, but you CAN help yourself. Your whole attitude to this is what's so poisonous. I know it's unbelievably hard being pregnant, but I can't imagine your partner working out of him with a pandemic atm is a barrell of laughs either. Maybe if you helped him bake or took over one of his chores to lighten his load it would make up for the time spent cooking YOUR cake.

But leave his video games alone. We all need to have our comforts, just like you do. Just own up and talk to him about it, and maybe he can make it more often if you move some of the chores around. Idk, it's your life, that's just a suggestion. To summarise: YTA, but not a huge asshole. Mistakes happen, but you need to admit it."

CoronavirusUK,fqamwel,t3_ghnpu5,1589221775.0,"I've just lost 2,500 because my accommodation refuses to pay us back for the term where we legally would not be able to live there. Probably more than a hundred students so a cool quarter-million for literally nothing at all. They told me if they ""managed to fill my room"" before September they'd pay me back some of the money.

If it's something beyond your control, it's beyond your control, and it takes some time and probably a lot of growth to come to terms with it, but it does get better."
