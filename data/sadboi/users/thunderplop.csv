DestinyTheGame,fqop1dz,t3_gjwb6o,1589520748.0,"There’s is nothing here to say other than fuck you too.
You’re giving us more and more reasons to forget this game and go back to D1 or wait until the next big content release, finish the “story” wait for it to progress. Drop the story in the next content update. And never go forward with it in a nice engaging way. Cayde is dead. Where is the next vanguard? The pyramid (by far the most exciting thing to happen recently) is still sitting. The prince is in a fucking shipping container with his pig. Exos still have dreams about a scawy tower. Ikora is growing hair. And whether we wanted it or not vuvuzela is pissing down on the city. Not to mention purple ball and the old tower is still unvisited and not a location we can go to and fuck around in. I’m just tired drunk and confused and want my god damn destiny. I’m sorry. Sunsetting making weapons obsolete is pissing me off and you could be focusing on making the game fun. I spent money on your game. I bought some Silver a while ago. I want fun in return. Sure i had fun saving saint. I had fun shitting motes into gambit man’s machine.  But it’s not fun anymore. There is too much to do with either too little reward or incentive. And also too little to do. Because it gets boring after a while. Wrapping up my confusing rant.. I’m still angry at you for taking my baby boy.. my cayde... :’("
