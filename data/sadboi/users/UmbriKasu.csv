Sorry for the formatting, I'm inquiring about this on mobile at work


I have had a migraine that has lasted me nearly for 2 weeks. I have tried excedrin, caffeine, tons of water and have been sleeping a lot more because of it. I can't go to the doctors because it is currently way out of my budget.


I was wondering if you had any tips to help me figure out what it maybe is and how to deal with it until I can afford to see a doctor. It is incredibly unbearable at most points and it is beginning to take a toll on me. 

Thank you in advance."
