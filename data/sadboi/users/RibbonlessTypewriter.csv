CPTSD,fmruzia,t3_fwt1qd,1586336434.0,"I don’t think there is a thing called “unintentional abuse” – there may be however unaware abuse. An example that comes to mind would be people who consider them selves helpers or carers who compensate for their own denied neediness and dependency by “helping others”, unaware that they cannot allow their charge to actually grow and become independent.

Also, even IF that certain textbook pathological narcissist president was actually unaware that he is severely gaslighting half of the country it would still not be unintentional.

To me things change when the perpetrator ignores feedback, be it the victims obvious suffering, the harm he is doing, be it resistance, protest, explanations. I have yet to meet an abuser willing to self-reflect, admitting: yes, it did happen, I was unaware, I was wrong, I did not mean it, I want to change. It just never seems to happen.

Therefore I look at any persistent or denied abuse as clearly  intentional."

ptsd,fm3thie,t3_fsqvz7,1585736400.0,"I’d say very plausible and not even untypical flashbacks. I’ve had very few descriptive flashbacks, partly revealing experiences of very early sexual abuse by my stepfather, partly my mother’s sadistic measures to keep me from talking. In either case the core abusive actions remained inaccessible or even noticeably censored as if “stamped out”. This is consistent with other victims’ reports of resurfacing memories in flashbacks. Having only peripheral memories resurface is by itself no indication of invalidity and I am surprised at your therapists’ scepticism.

That being said I am used to many therapists (not all) remaining somewhat neutral when dealing with flashbacks as to not encourage fabrications or misinterpretations or prematurely trigger you. It is less likely with trauma experts."
adultsurvivors,fm3n5uk,t3_fsv3io,1585729563.0,"Another vote for group therapy. I’ve had the experience that even when I can not bring up sufficient compassion for myself, I can still feel with others. Listening to other people’s horror stories is validating and loosens one’s dependence on “normality”. Topics that seem difficult to grasp or express may show much more clearly in social interaction or simply in the current “vibe” of a group. Another obvious advantage is that it is mostly left to you when and what to talk about.

Group therapy has its own pitfalls like occasional interpersonal conflicts, mutual triggering, lack of safety and trust, but worked through under the guidance of a vigilant and skilled trauma therapist can provide valuable insights.

Even though I am not a very sociable person and I have expert individual counselling, I owe most of my progress to the group.  Unfortunately due to the current Corona crisis “group” is pretty much taboo now."
adultsurvivors,fk5cq2f,t3_fgjttm,1583877860.0,"I can’t really tell wether you want advice or rather comfort and I am certainly not an expert on the matter, but you made it very clear that you already confronted your mother and that her reaction – regrettably – was the one to be expected. More than that: she continued to allow the perpetrator around.

I’ve seen people (including myself) struggle with the issue of confrontation/interaction and typically the problems arose from a lack of clear intent, goals and also means. So what is there to gain after she already failed you, failed you even more and will surely fail you again?

The only reasons for any interaction with perpetrators/enablers I can think of are:

* To repair a broken relationship, get validation which is rarely an option – and clearly not in your case.
* To bust/expose the perpetrators/enablers which requires not only means but also allies and listeners.
* To scare and troll the perpetrator (like my aunt did with my grandfather).
* To secure evidence for a legal case if that’s an option.
* To just stand your ground, vent your anger, say “Fuck you!” and leave (which requires only independence).

Whenever I have to interact with my parents it is war. My intention is to stay safe and to maintain my position and my sanity. And the means to that are to stay away and to provide as little information as possible (minimizing the threat of further abuse but also scaring the perpetrator since his memory of his crimes is certainly less sketchy than mine). I’d certainly love to confront/expose/defeat my perpetrators but currently I lack the means to it.

CPTSD,fk3s2sx,t3_fg44di,1583844755.0,"I am surprised how rarely the topic of dreams seems to come up here. With most of my traumatic past still veiled in darkness and still somewhat constricted emotions I rely heavily on dreams for evaluating the current state of affairs.

For the past half year in therapy it has been pretty obvious there is some dramatic revelation looming which may be the devastating emotions and memories of childhood CSA that my therapist expects – or some more specific macabre twist that I for certain reasons expect. Or both. (There were some really messed up people in my family.)

So for the time being I resort to dreaming – of bags. It is always the same black shoulder bag that gets me into trouble every time: it gets lost, it gets stolen with nobody caring, it is retrieved, I hide it from evil women (mother), I discover it behind a car’s open tailgate (open mouth), I can’t open it because someone tampered with the locks (gaslighting, dissociation), sometimes it contains my expensive cameras (values, important memories), it causes trouble at the airport security check (validation, new life perspectives), countless stories…

The generic meaning of baggage is burden. But it may contain precious things. Packing implies moving on/hiding/gearing up/taking decisions/clinging – details depend on circumstances and individual experiences. I’d guess in your case the most basic and reliable aspect is: change.

Apart from my own routine I looked into online “dream dictionaries” occasionally and found them as valid and useful as horoscopes. The so far only one I found useful ist this one:

The immense losses *after* the abuse are so far the hardest part to accept: the pain, the missed opportunities, the needless self-blame, the addictions, the isolation, the depression – and I am not 25 or 30 (when the first memories dawned) but 55! I presume the rage is still far worse but most of that lies still somewhat ahead of me.

There’s the merry-go-round, the ice cream booth, the roller coaster and the shooting gallery. I just happened to board the ghost train. There is nothing inherently wrong with it and it isn’t even less exciting than the other rides, actually more. It’s just not particularly enjoyable.

It usually involves early childhood abuse which makes things a lot more vague and messy than say surviving a car accident.

On the flashbacks: I've had only two of those classic cinematic flashbacks you seem to be talking about in 25 years. They actually seem to be rather uncommon with CPTSD. Most of the time it's ""emotional flashbacks"" (anachronistic behavioural and emotional reactions to often unconscious everyday triggers that resemble past threats). I don't have panic attacks. I rarely have nightmares.

I actually use to say I want more explicit flashbacks (since they bring back valuable lost memories) but it seems nature has its own ideas what things I am ready for."
CPTSD,fje1ukd,t3_fcyg0s,1583263586.0,"Well, that's why it's called emotional flashbacks, isn't it?

I remember incidents in my therapy when I felt victimised by female patients and it greatly helped to understand the extent of my mother's gaslighting and violent censorship.

There's a different thing here triggering me (don't tell anybody!):  It's when people mechanically start their replies with ""I am so sorry you had to go through this."" For some reason its cold repetitiveness creeps me out and I try my best to express empathy merely through helpful content and openness – or sometimes I just cry bit for myself."

I also started looking at my struggles in terms of mere triggers and corresponding unconscious flashbacks which makes A LOT more sense.

CPTSD,fj47duz,t3_fbf5zr,1583001969.0,"That’s a difficult one. IMO all judgements are entirely conditional, contextual, thus never inherently “true”. There is an emotional viewpoint, a legal one, an ethical one, a pragmatic one and many more.

Heck, there’s even the spiritual/nondual perspective stating that life is just one big flow of events none of which are inherently good or bad, right or wrong but rather arising spontaniously according to mere conditions. This includes the perceived personalities we deem in control and responsible – outside the flow – but they themselves are just the flow. Means: If you had grown up like your parents, with the same genetical, educational and biographical conditions, you’d be just as shitty.

And I wouldn’t even know how to argue with that.

But shitty is still shitty. And in this case I go with conventional reality: To give someone PTSD involves a severe and persistent crossing of boundaries and a denial of basic compassion that requires decisions and intention, i.e.: I never really believe in the “unaware” part. And the proof for that is the denial, lies, gaslighting, guilt, aggression that abusive parents typically show when confronted with their past or even ongoing doings.

My mother’s life for example can be considered a cascade of traumatic experiences, each possibly devastating, but I don’t think any of them forced her into blackmailing her children into tolerating and concealing criminal sexual abuse. Do I understand her? In a way. Do I forgive her? No. Would I want her around me? Do I feel ""guilty""? Answer for yourself.

If all else fails, forget for a moment about your parents being your parents and ask yourself instead if you would forgive them and wanted them around if they were just people. This is not difficult."
CPTSD,fitknla,t3_f9m2kg,1582722838.0,"Most of my trauma resulted not so much from the infant sexual abuse I suffered but far more from the environment’s denial, oppression and massive gaslighting.

Since I not only dread people unwilling to think for themselves and to notice substance but also greedy old men, politics is an absolute no go for me, I just want nothing to do with it.

adultsurvivors,fiq5w3z,t3_f8wedj,1582636048.0,"Sounds familiar. The uncovering of my own sexual abuse went hand in hand with strong intuitions about my mother’s lifelong expressions and projections of denied feelings of guilt, some of which involved not only the usual blaming and physical abuse but unexpected eruptive anxiousness about childhood sexuality.

I remember an incident when she had found a porn magazine that my stupid brother had left lying around, leading to bizarre and persistent interrogations “what we needed this for” (as if it wasn’t obvious). She was drunk as always, but different from my POS stepfather she usually wasn’t overly prude.

CPTSD,fh8qxlm,t3_f1s2oz,1581365540.0,"The term “OK” has many different meanings, some of which are surprisingly, even mind-blowingly profound, and honestly I don’t think the previous partly bitter comments valued all of them equally. I have a very personal, mildly (not exclusively) spiritual approach to this, so sorry for my somewhat cumbersome lecture:

Granted, in everyday use “OK” often means “just acceptable” and it implies mediocracy, compromise, tolerance, mild frustration or even oppression. It implies resistance – which strangely is the opposite of “OK”.

There are different meanings. Example: I remember being thoroughly underwhelmed and confused when I got involved in buddhist zen practice, reading that enlightenment (supposedly the greatest imaginable bliss) is merely “being OK with everything”. Kind of lame, right? Wrong.

I got glimpses of “OK”. Surprise! THAT “OK” is not grey, lukewarm, apathetic, a compromise, in the middle – it is alive, vibrant, active, optimistic, present, left and right, up and down, black and white, hot and cold, happy and unhappy – everything! **It is an acceptance that is no longer a compromise.** A different word for this is:

Peace.

It is not surrender to your abusers – it is surrender to your pain and sadness, which are real. It is not denying your losses – it is clearly seeing them. It is not denying yourself or becoming yourself – it is being yourself and feeling yourself and loving yourself. Now. For nothing but being alive. You will never find yourself in the past, because the past is dead and gone. You have been abandoned and you continue to abandon yourself by saying: What I am is wrong. I need to be right. But your present experience is never wrong. You are actually expressing guilt by rejecting it which you shouldn’t. Acceptance does not make you a victim – it actually ends you being a victim. This is peace.

If you manage to experience and accept what you are, you are better off than 99.9% of humanity who are in constant, mindless, fearful chase of control, power, success, money, fame, justice, ecstasy – all for the lack of “OK”, of acceptance, of total peace.

So “OK” is not finding a compromise about your past – it is embracing what is. It is not judging or correcting or ignoring your past – it is being at peace with it. It is not wrestling with your life – it is only dealing with what is at hand. Just imagine being OK, helplessly OK with whatever is, free. It can seem a struggle – it is for me – but sometimes it works really well. Just saying."

* There perpetrators were criminals.

* The incident doesn’t define my identity.
* It does not have to repeat.
* I am not supposed solve, avenge or undo the incident before seeking happiness my life.

Of course others equal “victim” with victim mentality which is not the same. Unfortunately it has become standard nowadays to resolve matters of understanding, responsibility and compassion through childish speech taboos and moral gagging.

It is very common to experience retraumatization when confronting abusers. This is because abusers are, well, abusive, second because there's often some harmful longing for validation involved, third because your abuser's reaction of denial, rage, pretended concern, pretended ""help"" trigger the false shame already planted in you through the original abuse.

adultsurvivors,f5zu8wi,t3_dpxoe0,1572588219.0,"No. At least not fundamentally. And I don’t even have substantial descriptive memory of anything (partly because it happened at infant age, partly because the details are still unbearable). I usually put it this way: If you found someone lying in the street profusely bleeding from several wounds, limbs missing etc. – would you doubt he experienced some kind of accident? Would you wait for bystanders’ confirmation before at least calling an ambulance? Would you suspect he did it to himself? Would you try to find the person responsible for the incident and ask him for help? Would you need to know the exact course of happenings first?

The injuries from childhood sexual abuse may not be visible but they are just as evident, severe and quite specific.

Unfortunately the tendency to self-blame and self-doubt is probably the most typical, universal and persistent aftereffect of CSA – because it usually happened at an age when self-blame is natural. Even worse: the chance of meeting any understanding or belief from “normal” people, the possibility of merely mentioning what happened to you to anybody not a therapist or a victim is close to zero. So there is even more blame from outside.

Group therapy with lots of other victims greatly helped to alleviate my early self-doubt. And even with a majority of advanced survivors 90% of the time the subject is self-blame and self-denial.

What I learned over time: in the end it’s not so much the crimes and the family’s insane denial that are unimaginable – it is the amount of healthy self-respect and self-care that I am denying myself. So if you want more certainty, try to work on this.

That being said, even to this day I sometimes wish, I could fall for my parents’ continuing sugar-sweet, venomed “concerns” and offers and invitations – and everything was well. I just can’t.

CPTSD,f1it9zo,t3_d9ij2o,1569514701.0,"I have known superiors who were immensely popular, humorous, caring, meek in public – yet authoritarian, selfish, sly and downright lying whenever they felt their goals in danger. This is nothing but a widely accepted form of gaslighting, and feeling annoyed or somewhat threatened by it is a sure sign of superior mental health.

I grew up surrounded by super-nice and respected molesters, abusers, murderers, and I give a fuck about people's charm if their behaviour is inconsistent, though I have to focus really hard at times to not fall for it.."
CPTSDmemes,f0k6j7o,t1_f0k1dlz,1568671569.0,"I don’t think so. I just feel frequently frustrated with people’s habit of – usually unconsciously – turning even the most natural and healthy impulses or ideas into some kind of individual or shared ideology, which leads to things like that awkward, hypocritical, downward “help” that you see so often in mainstream christianity and elsewhere. To me helping merely for the sake of some underlying ideology or ethics – which I am not supposing you do – is just as selfish as not helping at all.

I remember a certain zen teacher (another value system) saying that one’s help for others should be just as spontaneous and unconscious as adjusting your pillow during sleep. It really made a lot of sense to me. If you look at it – genuine care always feels like that.

So helping others can either be an opportunity to free oneself from the constraints of the intellect or to bury oneself even deeper in it. I find the first much more natural and enjoyable."
CPTSDmemes,f0k0z31,t1_f0jtv8m,1568667647.0,"Um, maybe I am nitpicking, but the only way of being nice is to actually care. It is called compassion and it is independent from beliefs or even thoughts. You would not spontaneously help someone in an emergency thinking ""I am confirming my value system"". The difference is important to me."
CPTSD,f0curcz,t3_d4fld1,1568545562.0,"I know your painful feelings exactly. I remember telling my very first therapist during the very first session that I was well aware as a child that I was being abused. And that I remembered how much I envied children I saw on TV sometimes during those times, children who where abused to a degree that left scars and bruises and broken bones – physical evidence that would have allowed me to involve the neighbors or the police, and that I did not have.

Instead I was surrounded by relatives and strangers who congratulated me for my “wonderful parents”, others demanding me to be even more obedient to my sadistic stepfather and my absusive, alcoholic mother (so that she wouldn’t start talking about the sexual abuse she had experience herself). Literally nobody cares how fucked up your family is as long as the household looks immaculate and the bills are paid. And even though you deeply know it's not right, you just have to give in (though you never really do). Even more so if you are in constant fear of losing whatever miserable shelter and care you have.

There was literally no possibility of rescue or only validation – even to this day. It all went down in an abyss of lies, crime, deception, denial, violence, alcohol, powerful sedatives prescribed by the original perpetrator and medic, generations of brainwashing – and people’s inexplicable greed for shallow “normality”.

You can call this wrong or unjust or outrageous, but is is just how it is. I escaped that living hell with a ruined life, ruined careers, ruined relationships but with my mangled mind still working and my broken heart still beating, with a healthy judgement, sharp senses, a deep sense of compassion, an unswerving love of beauty – different from virtually anybody involved in this mess. I consider this a triumphal victory. Maybe you can try the same."
CPTSD,f05nq6u,t3_d3umk2,1568414567.0,"Loving mothers - an example. Draw your own conclusions:

A couple of weeks ago I had the last ever talk with my alleged mother, trying to merely inform her of my sufficient memory that she – beyond the everyday horror of my childhood – had violently covered up the sexual abuse that I had experienced at very young age by sadistically abusing me the very moment I had involved her for rescue.

Before I could even get to the depressing facts, I was engulfed in a sermon of gaslighting, excuses and subtle accusations, sloppily camouflaged as “motherly concerns”. I aborted my mission after only minutes, seeing that no amount of force, arguing, evidence or even physical violence would ever penetrate through the wall of lies, dissociation, visible guilt, alcoholic amnesia and bare insanity that I was facing. I left quickly.

Today I had her on my answering machine, wondering if I was “dissatisfied’ with our “talk”, which we could ""resume"" anytime. You would not believe how, calm, collected, responsible and genuinely concerned she seemed. No doubt, a loving mother – the real thing.

The only thing I want from her is to die."
CPTSD,ezw2j1d,t3_d2m72s,1568206089.0,"I grew up in an environment of physical, verbal, strongly suspected sexual abuse, extensive denial and as I fear: something much, much worse. Mental struggles I noticed so far:

* A lifelong veil of dissociation and self-alienation that has become so habitual, it totally goes under my radar, only becoming apparent when I wake up in very painful, extremely rare explicit flashbacks.
* “Spacing out” AKA that “thousand yard stare” which I frequently had from age five.
* Reflexive numbing out when I am being lied to.
* Brief, massive, almost paralysing dissociation (“head feels stuffed with cotton”) in rare crises (only two times: 1. When a therapist confirmed my suspicions of sexual abuse, covered up by my mother. 2. When I confronted said mother about her crimes after my memory had returned.).
* General issues with short term memory: names, dates, misplaced items etc..
* Quickly overwhelmed with unstructured information or information excess despite being unusually smart (chatter, cluttered emails, distracting noise) until mind just blocks, rejecting any further input. (I don’t consider this a fault.)

Most of the symptoms seem to ease in situations when I feel safe and accepted which I seem to allow less and less lately. So I’d guess: Yes, your struggles may well be due to dissociation."
CPTSD,ezu4uzr,t3_d2cfmy,1568145418.0,"Congrats! Being mindful and getting work done are not two things though. They are the same. My zen teacher in Japan used to call this: “Let the dishwashing do the dishwashing.” To immerse oneself totally in the ordinary task at hand, to experience thoughts, feelings, sensations, actions without taking authorship, to drop all ideas of past and future, gain and loss is a wonderful experience. I used to succeed at this much easier at the kitchen sink or while sweeping the hallways than on the meditation cushion.

With my newly taken up therapy, plenty of corpses left to unearth and rage and grief still somewhat shy to fully blossom, my spiritual aspirations had to temporarily take a back seat. I still experience presence and love working on beautiful things like carefully editing photos or doing illustrations.

I hope to get back on track as soon as possible. Stay strong! 👍🏻"
ptsd,ezpge9f,t3_d16hxm,1568040148.0,"Totally so! I wasn’t properly diagnosed until the age of 55, having the first explicit flashback and therapy at 30. In between I experienced no more than a handful of devastating and deeply disturbing explicit flashbacks that seem to point way beyond the everyday terror and even the later emerging sexual abuse in my very normal, very scary family.

The flashbacks – however dreadful – felt like rising from the dead, and they shine a glaring light on the extent and persistence of my everyday dissociation. So different from most users here, I seem to suffer from too few flashbacks rather than too many.

I had an interesting talk with my therapist today who suggested that my apparent lack of flashbacks resulted from an unconscious avoidance of triggers. It seemed to make little sense at first until I remembered certain previous revelations and somewhat foggy flashbacks hinting that the most terrifying thing in my life is not violence or abuse but rather – happiness! And that I was leading a “high precision” pseudo life, meticulously crafted around the traumatic, violent loss of some unexpected, seemingly impossible source of happiness, safety, hope that I must have suffered at some point during the living hell of my childhood, rendering it completely invisible.

The journey I am on is nothing short of a psycho thriller. And I am equally excited an terrified by the matters to be revealed.

So yes, I want more flashbacks, because they make me feel alive for couple of seconds and they reveal lost memories. I’m just not sure if I will survive the next one.

Sorry, no further advice on staying awake though."

CPTSD,eywi5j2,t1_eyw6eby,1567530044.0,"While I see your point and even partly share it (including your anger), I consider your claim too generalizing. I think, looking at Christianity, you have to distinguish between Jesus’ teaching, its distored transmissions and interpretations and the power-ridden fan club that evolved around it. I am a devoted mystic and atheist who resigned from his forced Jesus Club membership first thing when coming of age.

Jesus was a mystic – not a christian. Christianity is a cult, just like about any human idea or activity in an ego-driven society unfailingly degenerates into a cult once organised (look politics, sports, philosophy, any religion, even buddhism,  atheism, nationality, environmental concerns, Freudians, veganism, whatever you want).

This does not devalue Jesus core teachings to me, which are widely respected, shared and quoted by eastern mystics. While I recommend reading Nisargadatta, Ramana or contemporary nondualists, rather than useless cherry-picking in that filthy “holy book”, I still see nothing wrong in “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” or “Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all."" (painful as it sounds to me)."

CPTSD,eyl8m5x,t1_eyl1aym,1567178756.0,"I totally agree with you. It feels indeed as if the brain immediately blacks out or gets ""merely bored"" when I am being bullshitted, then slowly, slowly, slowly catching up with the emotions. It is not difficult to guess why."
CPTSD,eykhuy3,t3_cxb35l,1567152445.0,"I think it's totally normal and expected to develop a certain hypervigilance and hypersensitivity if your safety or even your sense of reality depended on ""reading"" your abusive/denying/alcoholic/brainwashed etc. parents and family.

I grew up in a totally ""normal"" family with a long heritage of physical/sexual violence and extensive denial, controlled by a ""godfather""-like psychopath grandfather. 

As a result I generally give a fuck about people’s words and promises and instead just look. I easily catch people's vibes, and if something seems off or if I catch a familiar ""scent"" I'll react like a relentless terrier trying to unearth whatever skeletons they may keep in their closet. Of course this often leads to attempts to ""cure"" or ""expose"" assholes rather than simply avoiding them, which is not a very healthy or useful thing to do.

I noticed that I feel intuitively drawn to people with (often unconscious) experiences of childhood sexual abuse to a degree that I can just ""see it"". As if ""victims"" were the only people I feel safe with. I also react with immediate unease or aggression towards males who give off even the mildest vibe of a shizoid personality that always goes unnoticed by ""normal"" people. I often feel helpless or abandoned around people who are easily impressed by someone’s outward normality while ignoring all clues of deceptive or even openly abusive behavior.

Strangely, my hypersensitivity to body language, the atmosphere of a room, someone’s handwriting and things seems to go together with a certain blindness to people's intentions and verbal clues that other people catch effortlessly. As if I suffered from a constant miscommunication between gut and head (or mere dissociation). So I often end up feeling deeply disturbed by someone’s ""off vibe"" not knowing why or having to wait ages until my gut feelings reach the brain, sparking insights, conclusions and reasonable actions.

I really hope to get over this one day."
ptsd,ewepsyy,t3_ckxsxz,1565332574.0,"Thank you so much for bringing this up! I was almost certainly sexually abused during childhood (which I have zero explicit memory of) and I was just recently diagnosed with PTSD.  One everyday symptom has been what I called „shame flashes“:

Whenever some harmless random memory crosses my mind that involves even the mildest shame I will repell it by mumbling some „magic spell“ which typically involves filth or self-hate. My quite macabre hit list so far:

- Fuck!
- Beat me to death!
- I want to be dead.
- I hate myself.

A previous favourite was „body pieces“ - whatever I meant by that. I always wondered if others experience the same. Quite reassuring to know."
CPTSD,ew3pu0y,t3_cmo6f5,1565090638.0,"Probably not that you had in mind: For many years, listening to Richard Wagner ([sample](https://youtu.be/2JgMt8GWdyU?t=927)) on full blast has had substantial therapeutic effect on me, for the simple reason that it is too intense to merely listen to it – you have to let it take you over entirely, physically, you just surrender to it. It reliably wipes out any doubt and brooding and replaces it with anything you could ever want: there is just breathing, hysterical screaming, tension, drama, crying, violence, incest, death and that immense, majestic rhythm. It gains me access to my rotten past in ways that I would otherwise only reach in hypnosis.

More than any I liked the recordings with James Levine conducting. Turns out he is a busted teen molester. Oh my…"
CPTSD,evxrpkc,t3_clr3k1,1564904442.0,"My “mother” has no memory problems at all. In fact she remembers perfectly that nothing ever happened. She also remembers exactly that she didn’t call me a “schizophrenic” when I called her out for the second time on the sexual abuse that occurred in my family  (the first confrontation was when I was seven and she sadistically abused me for it, which also didn’t happen). When I recently told her that I finally had regained sufficient memory to verify my allegations, she tried to subtly gaslight me into what a mentally unstable loser I am. Watching my gentle mother turn into the heartless, defensive bitch she is felt like a time travel into my childhood.

The funny thing is that I might never have discovered what happened if I hadn’t been fascinated all my life with my mother’s violent projecting and acting out of suppressed feelings of guilt. She oozes guilt. Her entire lifestyle is about guilt.

There is one more thing I remember: I’ll remember to tell her to go fuck herself on the next occasion I meet her."

It wasn’t until 30 that flashbacks emerged which pointed to sexual abuse and I finally got diagnosed with PTSD at 55! I shudder remembering certain well-meaning therapists and one braindead psychoanalyst who tried to talk me out of my obvious experiences. The point I am trying to make is: 1. Even a somewhat bad upbringing is bad enough. 2. You may not remember everything. 3. If you suffer from trauma you need trauma treatment from trauma experts. Don’t waste your time discussing and bargaining with amateurs. Go for it!!"
