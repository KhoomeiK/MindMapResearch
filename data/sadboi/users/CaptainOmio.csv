Google sensory boxes/bins and you'll get all kinds of ideas for little Tupperware or storage boxes which you can prefill with goodies and have her pull one out at a time! 

Some of my favorites include dried beans with little cars and trucks or different size cups to fill, little balls or stuffed toys and a pincher toy (or if you dont have one try tongs), a magnetic tin lid or cookie sheet with magnetic letters, all kinds of craft stuff like markers and paper, different kinds of blocks for building, rice with small toys or funnels and cups, and water play is ALWAYS a good one! (For water play, make sure the water isn't more than an inch or two in the bottom with maybe some food coloring colored ice cubes for safety.)

Hopefully google or pinterest can give you more ideas and your husband could easily help set these up with you pre or post work. If you're willing to let her make a bit of a mess (like paint or shaving cream), set down a bit of newspaper or a towel beforehand :)

The middle sister who HATES children is living bill-free while her mom and sister (with a child she is supporting) pay for EVERYTHING. She needs to suck it up, act like a grown-up who has to occasionally deal with shit they don't want to, and help out every once in a while on the rare occasion she is asked because it's a family and she should contribute at least a bit of her time since her sister (with child) is supporting her. 

It's not a case of she would be helping her sister and niece out of the goodness of her heart, although I do think it is a bit much that she refuses to help her niece at all with the simplest of things (example: making a sandwich), but a case of she is living expense free and her younger sister (with a child) supports her. She needs to either find a job to move out and not deal with the situation at all, find a job to contribute a third of the expenses to the household finances, or pick up her niece occasionally when her sister is working to pay half for the entire family to live.
