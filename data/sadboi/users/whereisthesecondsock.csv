depression,erll5wl,t3_c2n9qv,1560990130.0,"Recently, I began to notice that I was really aggressive towards my parents (especially my mother).

I have trouble sleeping because of depression, I often fall asleep and get very angry about it.

but still...

Yes, my mother is not perfect, but she did not deserve such an attitude from me.

I do not know what to do with this, but still I want to change. Because I can change. Because people can change, this is our peculiarity.

Hey, I'm sure you're not a bad person and maybe your brain is trying to convince you otherwise. I ask you to contact a specialist, even if you have already done this. Discuss it with someone.

I hope you will be fine."

depression,erliaeb,t3_c2fuf3,1560987910.0,"In my country, depression is a stigmatized phenomenon that many do not take seriously, especially if you are a teenager. In the same way, my parents know almost nothing about the phenomenon of depression and mental disorders in general. It's quite difficult, because when I start talking, why I am not okay, they scream at me that a psychiatrist (a separate story, if in a nutshell - he violated my personal boundaries and behaved extremely unprofessional towards me) he said that I should not be interested in psychiatry and I should not know that. I always say that I'm just lazy and I need to go in for sports and the most important thing is to CLEAN YOUR ROOM.

P.S. I am sure that there are mistakes in the text, so I apologize for it in advance and Iâ€™m justified - everything is very bad with English."
