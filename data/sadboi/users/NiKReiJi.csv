The difference is that with cancer and heart disease, those will stay essentially static until an absolute cure is totally found. Which may never happen in our lifetime. With COVID you can take social measures and things to reduce infection. A vaccine is projected for possibly next year. There’s potential hope there. So assuming the numbers in the article are accurate, it means that COVID was the leading cause for a brief window in time. Annually, it probably won’t be nearly as close.  The headline is pretty sensationalized."
The_Mueller,fr1oflt,t1_fr1gjk2,1589823233.0,"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm

Keep in mind these numbers are from 2017, but it could be assumed that the figures stay relatively consistent over time without the implementation of an extreme variable. Assuming COVID-19 numbers are accurate, then it’s passed what would be reasonably projected amounts of annual diabetes deaths by May, and if things continue will pass projected accidents deaths by probably September or October. 


1.Heart disease: 647,457

2.Cancer: 599,108

3.Accidents (unintentional injuries): 169,936

4.Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 160,201

5.Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 146,383

6.Alzheimer’s disease: 121,404

7.Diabetes: 83,564

8.Influenza and pneumonia: 55,672

9.Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 50,633

10.Intentional self-harm (suicide): 47,173

But again I want to be clear, these are from 2017 and I’m the one projecting these for 2020 (as obviously we can’t have annual stats yet).

WTF,fqwli5j,t3_gl96q4,1589708869.0,Well time for a WTFDI (that’s Who The Fuck Dun It)
dbz,fqvrjqc,t1_fqvjyx8,1589683578.0,"Lol what? The scene I’m talking about is where Goku powers to each level eventually concluding that blue is the only way to get Jiren to even move. If it’s the scene about spirit bomb omen, Jiren says “this is your limit” and blasts him away. Jiren proved Goku wasn’t a match even with omen, which Jiren believed was as far as Goku can go. Why exert even more effort on an opponent who he thinks isn’t worthy of his time? Then Hit jumped in immediately after. He was still not a threat and MUI was never mentioned outside of a quiet convo between beerus and whis. 

Goku then fights kefla as omen, wins, toppo acknowledges that Goku is getting stronger. Jiren nods and chooses to not end Goku while he’s exhausted. Again showing his overconfidence. 

And if you’re talking about the part where he’s omen for like 2 seconds before going MUI, Jiren unleashed an attack to “respond in kind”. And you gotta remember the time frame in the ToP is just as wack as the “namek will explode in 5 mins” time frame. Jiren powered up an attack that he thought would be enough and it wasn’t. Or at least “respond in kind” could be assumed that he thought it wouldn’t be a waste and be totally negated. 

Right before he unleashed the attack he was in awe, smiled, and then attempted an attack that ended up being too late or too weak to even touch Goku. So take your pick of reasons: 

a) Jiren was awestruck and hesitated when Goku went MUI and was too late for his “response in kind” to work

b)Jiren waited for gokus power to stabilize, during his MUI transformation possibly thinking that an attack would get out of control or just simply not be enough, 

c) Jiren was thirsty for a worthy fight and finally saw one in goku, 

d) the sense of time in this show is actually way faster than what is actually portrayed because it cuts to other characters reactions lengthening the time of the scene, as well that the action would be impossible to see if it were scaled to real time, (each episode after Kefla loses equates to roughly about 1 min 5 seconds in tournament time),

e) Jiren is really just that cocky that he either thought his blast would defeat Goku when he went MUI whether it was full strength or not. And he did the same thing that every villain in this franchise does and claimed an early victory by underestimating Goku. Giving chance after chance to let him get stronger for... reasons. 

Goku then proceeds to fight Jiren till he rages and now HE achieves a power that is never confirmed he was capable of, skilled enough, or emotional enough to have reached before. Surpassing his own previous limits out of desperation that he never once felt in their previous matches. 

I’m sure anyone could think of more plenty more reasons. All of those reasons are perfectly reasonable and logical. Yet none of them are substantiated in really any logically sound way. But I’ll concede too because Jiren actually did win every fight against *solo* Goku. Albeit that last time was due to luck lol"
dbz,fqvij4o,t1_fqvf3f1,1589678014.0,"The scene you’re describing I believe happens before they fight. When they are testing each other. That was before the first omen transformation. And Goku quickly got Jiren to move when he went blue. Like 20 seconds into the scene. At that point neither of them knew Omen or MUI was even a thing. So Jiren was absolutely sure going 100% power was not even remotely needed. Also you just proved my point even more by pointing out that one of your main premises is based on how you’ve misremembered the scene. 

What I’m saying is that you think you’re making the argument of 1+2=c=3. You’re actually making the argument a+b=3. You don’t know the actual values of a and b. Because the information doesn’t exist. 

My argument is a+b+c+etc=X. I’m purely stating my opinion while leaving room for interpretation based on the fact that MY premises AS WELL cannot be totally confirmed. Only logically argued based on other supporting premises. 

Also claiming the truth of a conclusion or premise based on the inclusion or exclusion of a variable is a logical fallacy. So no I won’t argue it. This is literally just an atheism vs theism argument lol. 

I can’t prove the truth of my argument any more than you can. I personally believe the argument I’ve given. My premises are based on common traits, anime writing tropes, themes and frequent types of character development and behaviours. Both inside and outside of the DB franchise. But ultimately I’m offering my opinion and pointing out the fallacy in your argument."
dbz,fqvdx56,t1_fqvaq8o,1589675218.0,"I’m saying you have no idea IF he was 100%. You’re only assuming. You can’t say he clearly wasn’t 100% when the information doesn’t exist. Claiming it as fact. Jiren is arrogant and stoic. That’s a classic anime trope. Tons of characters do this. Just because he wasn’t showing much emotion doesn’t mean he wasn’t trying his best. You’re making an assumption based on information that doesn’t exist. 

If the creators come out and say he was toying with Goku before MUI then I’ll concede my argument, but you’re essentially arguing that screaming + angry face = full power. It’s common in anime to see expressionless characters dominate fights/not react to pain, etc. It’s meant to imply a high level of discipline and experience. Look at Hit vs Goku. He literally says he had to pass his limits on the spot which he’s never had to do before. Possibly he didn’t even know he could do it until it was necessary in the moment. Same with Freeza. Never trained a day in his life until Super. 

Plus 100% power in this context doesn’t necessarily mean going all out. It was stated early in the ToP that the strategy to win was to treat it as a marathon, not a sprint. You may as well argue that Jiren should’ve just obliterated the arena minute 1. He likely could have. You can’t claim the premises in your argument are true, not have access to the information that may or may not confirm it to be true, and call it sound logic."
dbz,fqvaepd,t1_fqv9az1,1589673119.0,"But a limit stops being a limit when it’s passed. Before Goku turns SSJ for the first time, he was definitely using 100% of his strength. Then he went beyond that, establishing a new 100%. Plus I said Jiren *may* not have been using 100% but that’s never been confirmed one way or the other. Toyotaro and Toriyama are the only ones who can answer that. Personal, I think he was at 100% of his previous limit. Jirens strength matched gokus speed. My opinion is that it would’ve ended in a tie simply by running out the clock."
dbz,fqv92l5,t1_fqtiq77,1589672340.0,"It’s not about hindsight. The entire ToP arc is themed around passing previous limitations. The whole show really. It’s like saying why didn’t Gohan go SSJ2 right from the beginning of the Cell Games. Why should Jiren be treated any differently? Vegeta reaches Blue Evo through sheer willpower. Kale masters her rage form. Jiren may not have been at full power during Omen, but he was in control of the fight until Goku got MUI. Desperation kicks in and he had to pass his limits."

Self destruction and a rejection of science is in their nature.

I’m not sure if this is the plan that you’re referring to, but this is a copy of the most recent plan I could find established by the Obama administration.

It’s a 69 page document that should take the average college student 90 minutes or less to thoroughly read over. The Trump Admin had 3+ years and chose to ignore it. It’s existed since 2016.

I live in Canada. Our population is roughly 10% of the American population YET you all have a 20x larger infection rate and a ~19x fatality rate in regard to COVID-19. Mathematically, that is totally fucked up. There is no defendable excuse for this. Population density can be argued but not definitively. Just terrible leadership, a federal governing body that wants to dismantle the closest thing to a universal health care system America has ever had and the active disregard of advice from the experts it should be relying on. The Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect by any means, but removing it, especially now, is nothing short of self destruction.

If you want something to protest, how about protesting against the lack of mass testing that SHOULD be getting done. That’s the only way the economy can re-open without immediately being brought back to where we are now. It astounds me how incapable of long term thinking people can be.

When the pandemic is finally under control, and statistics are able to be made and analyzed, I’d be interested to see how infection and fatality rates correlate with political leanings. I suspect it will show a trend of conservatives and republicans having a higher infection rate than democrats and liberals. Largely because of sentiments encouraged by the Ben Shapiro’s of the world.

As a liberal Canadian who pays maybe a little too much attention to American politics, I have to say that I have a lot  more faith that I’ll come out of this alive and healthy than most conservative republicans. There’s nothing coincidental as to why our statistics of infections and deaths per million trend so much lower than the American statistics. And anyone, having the exact same access to information I have, who choose to protest stay-at-home-measures and social distancing should be criminally charged with reckless endangerment, or voluntary manslaughter if they end up killing a friend, family member or stranger over it.

There, my rant is done. I shall eagerly await your downvotes and I’ll enjoy reading your arguments as to why you should have the right to endanger the health of those around you. Just remember, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Fox News, Ben Shapiro and any of the other GOP cronies that congregate in that circle of narcissistic sociopaths don’t give a damn about you. You’re only a vote and a paycheck to them. And if my hypothesis about the virus positively correlating with political leanings happens to be true, then there may not even be enough conservatives alive by November to keep Trump in office. So, if you want to be healthy, or alive, enough to vote for Trump in November, maybe try taking the advice of those trying to save your lives rather than taking the advice of those simply wanting to line their pockets.

It’s probably in Putin’s best interest to keep Trump on his leash rather than sabotage him politically. 

When COVID-19 gets more under control, I genuinely feel like there will be a disproportionate amount of Trump voters who will die due to COVID-19 related reasons over democratic voters as it appears that democrats/liberals tend to take things like social distancing and scientific methodology more seriously, as well as take their cues from experts over Trump or his administration. 

This is however not a blanket statement on republicans. Just the ones who view Trump as the next Jesus Christ. I know that the vast majority of people are not being stupid.

(Story is copied/pasted from link)

A fellow was stuck on his rooftop in a flood. He was praying to God for help.

Soon a man in a rowboat came by and the fellow shouted to the man on the roof, ""Jump in, I can save you.""

The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, it's OK, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me.""

So the rowboat went on.

Then a motorboat came by. ""The fellow in the motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, I can save you.""

To this the stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""

So the motorboat went on.

Then a helicopter came by and the pilot shouted down, ""Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.""

To this the stranded man again replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""

So the helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon the water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me drown. I don't understand why!""

To this God replied, ""I sent you a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter, what more did you expect?"""

CanadaCoronavirus,fo5l4h5,t1_fo5hu5p,1587528343.0,"This was in no way implied by your earlier comments. But my point is that if you go to Costco wearing gloves, then go to Walmart wearing those same gloves 30 mins later, you could be bringing germs from Costco to Walmart via your gloves. Are you sanitizing the gloves too? Before and after going into the stores? It’s good to hear that you’re distancing well for your own safety but this is the same as a doctor wearing the same gloves with each patient. 2 stores twice a month should be at least 4 pairs of gloves. Minimum. That’s the point I am trying to make. 

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/6787323/coronavirus-do-gloves-help-protect-against-covid-19/amp/

This article (and many others I’ve looked at say the same) gives a pretty compelling argument to not wear gloves for day to day activities. The points I found to be the most interesting are that:

 A: because average medical gloves are not built for normal day wear and tear, a simple snag could render them useless. 

B: there’s potential evidence to suggest that the virus actually clings better to latex than it does to human skin. (Which supports my point about spreading the virus from point A to point B via gloves). 

C: it could give people a false sense of security which may result in more and more people not abiding by hand washing or social distancing rules. (Which supports what I’m pretty sure the other commenter was talking about when they were mentioning “magic glove syndrome” or whatever it was)

D: A lot of people who don’t work in the medical field don’t actually know that there is a specific technique to removing gloves after they’ve been potentially contaminated. Not knowing this technique likely means that when you take them off you’ll just end up contaminating you hands anyways. Thus rendering them worthless. (This one I didn’t actually know and thought it was interesting). 

There are more arguments but those ones stood out to me. So take it as you will. Personally I don’t think you’re protecting anyone, not even yourself, by wearing them. Best case scenario is that it makes no difference. The consensus in the medical community seems to be they do more harm than good though."
