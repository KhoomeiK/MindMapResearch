you may be a ""depressed introvert"" but you sound to me like a wonderful, kind, caring and sensitive mother. listen to the others in this thread.... be in gratitude. thank the universe for your children in these times. they are more strong-willed than even you may realize. and it sounds like your son is only taking the proper precautions to ride out the storm."

latebloomerlesbians,fi6m22n,t3_f6ngyx,1582200651.0,"Hi hi hi, thank you for sharing your story. I came out last year after being with a man (the same one) for 8 years, even while knowing deep down I was gay and not knowing how to confront that. I know you're not here asking for advice because it sounds like you're coming into some very honest self-awareness, but if I could humbly offer some learnings from the last two years of my stumbling around in my own doubt: work on yourself. Gay, bisexual, or straight, it doesn't matter your orientation but at some point in your life, you need to spend time (helpful if it's 6+ months) as a single person. I know it must sound terrifying, potentially lonely, but trust me: there is so much happiness to be found in getting to know yourself. Return to the things that interest you, the things that made you happy as a child (for me, it was music), take yourself out to a movie, take yourself out to dinner, banish the feeling in your heart that you can't be caught ""alone."" You can do this!"
bipolar,fi4cnc3,t3_f6cz6f,1582138490.0,wait‚ÄîWHAT? your therapist is telling you this?! it sounds like it's time for a new therapist!!
latebloomerlesbians,fi0ed28,t3_f5qm7z,1582034891.0,"wow congratulations my dear! your story sounds very similar to the last year of my life.... I was with a man for the last 8 years, or between the ages of 19-27. I used to love this man and there were many great things about him/our relationship, but deep down I knew that something needed to change and it wasn't until I started becoming more comfortable with my sexuality that I realized (duh) what it was and just how BIG of an impact it would have. nearly a year and a half later, i'm still picking up the pieces and discovering all the little things that weren't working or making sense and now they seem so obvious to me! it's ridiculous but also so reaffirming... things that make my heart sing.

anyway - point is: I love your story. I am so happy for you. congratulations to your new life, your new (bomb ass) self, to your newly found happiness, and wishing you all the best in your journey ahead. you go girl!"
