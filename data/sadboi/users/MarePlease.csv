It sounds to me like some time away would be therapy for you. Why not talk to your therapist and get it where they are on your side. I think more people would be willing to help with a medical opinion backing you up.
I do agree your boyfriend is not helping the situation and could be making it worse since you have zero control over your life from what I can tell."
