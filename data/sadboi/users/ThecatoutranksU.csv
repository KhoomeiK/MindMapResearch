EDIT:  also the LD50 rating is the MEDIAN lethal dose. So no, not everyone dies/ODs with these amounts, but the AVERAGE person can. LD100 is the lowest does that kills everyone, but i have no clue about those amounts. My paper was only comparing alcohol and marijuana so those are the only ones i looked at."

But take alcohol for example: we all know its easy to get alcohol poisoning, so naturally it has a low LD50 (median lethal dose) rating. It was 1:10. So say if you took 10 shots of vodka in like 15mins (or whatever time frame they found it to be), the average person would die/get alcohol poisoning. 

Its also been a few years since I read all this  so I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that they have done more research now that marijuana is legal in many places, and have better data.  But this was the conclusions I got when I wrote my paper on legalization back in like 2014. It was for a criminal justice major though so please dont think my dumbass is a scientist lolol :p"
