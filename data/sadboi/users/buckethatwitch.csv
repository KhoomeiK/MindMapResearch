CPTSD,fop3mwr,t3_g8r2jg,1587952349.0,"Yes, I also think my empathy and emotional intelligence has improved greatly since facing trauma.

It also makes me happy that I can make other people happy, smile and laugh though. I don't know. Nowadays I don't pretend and I'm thankful. I have started to care more about life and people. 

I've also become a chameleon since trauma. My physical appearance changes frequently and drastically. I've been non contact with my abusers for years but I've always fear encountering them on the streets as they live in the same town as me. I did actually encounter them once when I was supposed to be meeting a friend. They didn't recognise or notice me at all though. Still had to cancel all of my plans."

 This was a few years ago so I don't exactly remember the lines but a few weeks ago I watched a trailer on the new movie about souls. I think the same director or studio made Inside Out so it led to a lot of people wondering if it was going to be just as heartfelt; Inside Out being about emotions and growing up and other hardships whilst Soul (I think it's called that, but hopefully you get what movie I'm on about) is about death and... souls.

CPTSD,fol1mlz,t3_g7ygvi,1587853106.0,"Definitely. This is most likely the reason why I try to be a good girl getting overwhelmed by rereading guidelines on everything and double checking with others if something is wrong or right. I want to be competent and on best behaviour no matter the circumstance. My boyfriend made a silly joke about sneaking out to see each other and tried to reassure me that nobody would punish us. Yeah, no. They definitely would. It scared me a lot.

Even stern tones in voices terrify me. I feel like something more punishing would come after. This whole fear is likely wrought from our abusers punishing us on every little thing they deemed was wrong. And of course the punishment itself."

It's especially frustrating being able to finally get away from your abuser in reality and then they visit during nightmares or flashbacks. Vivid nightmares are the worst. It's terrifying and I'm really understanding you on this.

Not to mention the third sentence in the second paragraph. It's more likely than you think amongst sexual trauma survivors. I don't know why some of us do it but we do. For me, I feel very shameful during it but I can't really help it.

I think that you should perhaps return to therapy after this whole pandemic is over and done with. You could settle with online therapy meanwhile. Be sure to check out posts on the subreddit about coping mechanisms and grounding techniques. I think that they really help!

other times whenever I showed my crying or being visibly anxious, I was told that that it was fake and manipulative as you said in the title. this also made me feel very fake and I often had doubt in my emotions.

fast forward to where i am now in comparison to when I thought I had to conceal my emotions, im very open to when I'm upset and distressed although I do hate making situations about myself. i feel incredibly selfish whenever I am upset and distressed because of my past experiences displaying those emotions. plus, I feel like im victimising myself... even though I am actually the victim, it doesn't feel right to show my distress."
