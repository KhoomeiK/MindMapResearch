I would love to know if someone made it out of this type of situation as well, because I'm losing more hope every day. I have my mom to stay alive for now at least, but I hope to have more than that someday."
depression,eqiwpg9,t3_byke8d,1560094904.0,"Sam situation. 28 years old. All of my friends are now married with families or are in long-term relationships. I still get invited to gatherings with them because they are legitimately great friends and great people, but it's so damn lonely, depressing, and weird to be the only one there who is single. I find myself turning down the invites more and more because I dont want to be the creepy weird uncle who doesnt have his life together."
depression,eqi394g,t3_bydccf,1560077872.0,"I've made so many terrible choices and bad mistakes that have gotten me to being 28 years old with no meaning and dreaming about dying. I've had anxiety/depression since I was about 12 years old, and I remember my childhood being the only time I can remember not feeling like shit. I would give anything to to back then and see if I could change anything to not end up where I am right now."
depression,eq5vf8o,t3_bx4i3l,1559815268.0,"This post hit close to home. I have many wonderful things in my life: close friends, supportive family, decent job, lots of ""stuff"". It all feels completely meaningless without a companion. It just feels so unachievable as well, like it's impossible almost. It's also hard seeing all my other friends in long and sustained relationships. It casts a cloud over what would otherwise be a good life."
depression,epym7qt,t3_bwfo05,1559643089.0,"I think about this every day. I lost my father last year, so the last thing I'd ever want to do is cause my mother that much pain. That is most likely the only reason I am still here right now. And as I think others have said, cherish having a girlfriend. I have many close friends, and yet feel like I have nothing because I lack that special connection to someone. That can maybe keep you going as well."
depression,ept0p4b,t3_bvup45,1559477118.0,"I feel this way pretty much all the time. The best way I've always described it is like an alarm going off that only I can hear. Sometimes its louder, sometimes it's more quiet, but it's always there. I'll still have fun when I'm with friends, but the moment I can be alone in my thoughts it's right back again. Sometimes everything will click and it will stop for half a day or so, but the sadness/anxiety always comes back within a day usually."
