MDMA,fqoedei,t1_fqodoo4,1589513358.0,"yes me too!! like being crossed eyes and not having to force it is entertaining enough! but rolling while seeing two of everything is actually so dope. and yeah totally the closing one eye to text, pick up a drink etc, and it becomes so much smaller! i wanna try to paint or draw something while my eyes are crossed! and yeah i also am the talk of the party when my eyes are like that hahah"

MDMA,fqhygt1,t1_fqhy89j,1589386775.0,"even if someone dies from overheating or dehydration, if they find drugs in their system, the media will be like ‚Äúoverdose of ecstasy‚Äù. kinda like w the covid, even if someone goes into cardiac arrest, they still are ruling it as death by the virus. it‚Äôs likely the media‚Äôs way of trying to stray ppl away from it rather than teach harm reduction :/"

BPD,fofqs2s,t1_foei7w5,1587741158.0,"just because you have a personality disorder doesn‚Äôt mean that there are times you are able to legitimately respond better and more under control, and when we do respond in control, but just not agree w someone and they ask ‚Äúare you having another episode‚Äù then that obvi triggers an episode for some people. if my feelings are invalidated, i do get angry and it brings on an episode. maybe talk to him ab that"
