BipolarReddit,fjvqrbi,t3_fezp34,1583630014.0,"Hi there. I may be on the edge of mania so don't judge too hard my syntax, BUT. Here is a tldr version of what I've got through relationships and what experience I can offer. 

So my current relationship is rn 8 years and counting. I'm 24 to 25 (F) so it's basically the only serious enough, even though I've been in enough before... Anyway.
Unfortunately I've been an asshole to him multiple times, either while being manic, or extremely depressed. He's a psychiatrist (that makes it also more complicated) but he's able to understand.
 
Obviously, he's known me for so much time that a great level of understanding already existed, but I got to seek therapy and professional help only last year.
This period I basically fucked so greatly our relationship that after that, we found ourselves getting to know each other from the start, getting into a new relationship. It was so fucking hard to ""come out"" to him and face the whole problem. We were almost breaking up every ten days or so, so practically the relationship was non existent. Apart from that I also had the huge dilemma of whether should I tell my friends, or not. What I've concluded at it's that I'd better be forward than not- the nature of me will come out anyway so I feel it's better to have my close friends prepared. 

So you may be anxious right now, I completely get it. Facing yourself while presenting it to another person is totally scary. You don't really know how he'll react or if he's ready for a relationship like this. But, on the other hand... I hardly know anyone not suffering from a mental health problem-either consistent or not- and you probably can agree to that. There's no one really 100% mentally healthy. There's no reason for you to not be able to open up, even if it's scary. Even if it won't work with everyone, I strongly believe honesty is worth the effort. For me it was a hard choice for so many reasons but the fact that I opened up, even so late in the relationship, basically helped more than not. 

I think this is getting too long, sorry, lol. As I said, too much energy rn. I truly wish you all the best, and feel free to ask anything if you wish.

Edit: this wasn't tldr at all, sorry. (:"

Anyway what I'm saying is I understand what you're going through, and that of course this whole roller coaster affects deeply my companion. And some friends too. She surely understands this also.

I used to be in a very similar state that you describe your gf to be, a year ago, due to some stressful life changes as well as a change in medication. I wasn't well adjusted to it etc. It was also very new for me, even if I knew I had issues with unresolved cptsd growing up. Several outbursts, suicidal ideation, self harm, panic attacks, basically almost everything you described. 

What held me together was my bf and our shared best friend being in touch all the time for a period, then slowly letting me re- enter life, I guess. Communication in depth w my psychiatrist both for me and for them was key, and lots of patience. 

Take care of her if you wish, believe me distance doesn't have to be the problem. Also please remember to take good care of your mental state as this whole trip will surely cost you, too. I can't thank enough the people that helped me and I tell them that. I also wanted to understand how my ups and downs affect them. 

Be patient, stay informed, and I wish you all the strength."

I find it hard but I try to have absolute faith in my psychiatrist and really trust them, that  having always a diagnosis isn't for the best. Imagine having too early a diagnosis and ending up being the wrong one. Terrible thing to be undone and requires lots of work since as you said we easily mirror ourselves in any given diagnosis. 

Wish you all the best."
BPD,fgf7mb3,t3_extrd9,1580728749.0,"Hi there. I feel you rn. I think I'm starting to devaluate my closest friend because he said he's going to another city to spend a couple of days w some old friends. 

The thing is, these people have been very toxic for him in the past so I sometimes feel like I'm doing the right thing ""hating"" them. So I'm constantly in a loop where I don't know if I'm splitting or trying to be a good friend. 

I have found it helpful in the past to talk directly to the person I'm splitting about (even if I don't understand what I'm doing atm) about my feelings and try to explain the situation. We became closest friends or at least more understanding of each other most of the times. 

I'm telling you this because as you pointed out you are friends with this person for the last five years, so I see chances of better bonding w her in the process, preparing for any future reoccurrence of this situation. 

Have a nice day :))"
BPD,fgf5c24,t3_exobui,1580725283.0,"Hi, same here, happened a year back when I was only starting on my meds and hasn't figured out which is the right one. It's really dangerous to get back to exactly the same level so please be careful. Every relapse after this seemed worse for me and I'm always super tired afterwards."
