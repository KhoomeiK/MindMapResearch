It’s just very disheartening how little control and influence I have over anything to do with him. Like I said. She holds all the cards. She’s trying to make it so the only way I can be a part of his life is through her. She’s ignoring me but still has hooks in me in every area of my life.

I love this girl. That’s part of the reason this is so hard. I don’t think she can help it. I want to be angry but I don’t know how.

So I’m just living and trying to get my feet under me so that I can get to a place where a few words from her can’t destroy me."

I’d try to explain just how perfectly the situation Is set up to make me look insane but it’s very very complicated. I look like a psychotic 21 year old guy with a personality disorder and I have had a diagnosis for years.

She holds ALL the chips and everyone except my direct family is on her side. Everyone.

One thing I never experienced with her was her cheating. IK it’s a common symptom but that’s one thing I never dealt with... I’m 99% sure it is my child. The timing lines up. We were engaged."

It’s been a year and the thought of another relationship repulses me. She had my kid 3 months after she left me and refused to let me be there for his birth so I’m not even legally his father. I have one picture. She hasn’t spoken to me in 10 months.

Her family replaced her supply when they rallied around her to protect her from me (the crazy one), and now she has our kid to use and as an attention and love magnet.

I know it’s just the trauma bond talking but I know if she even messaged me to ask how I’ve been I’d get sucked right back in. I feel powerless."
