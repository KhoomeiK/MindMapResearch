She lied to you. And that's a really BIG lie. This is definitely something you needed to know about in case the biodad gets out of prison and decides he suddenly wants to see his kids.   


And wouldn't biodad have to sign his rights away? How would she keep that a secret?  


Okay. So, YTA for the way you view the kids. Almost as if they're a burden to you, a road-block into getting what you want. Parenthood - even step-parenthood - is more than just ""sucking it up"". It's more than just putting up with the kids. Yes, sometimes kids can be... well, kids, but clearly you are not ready to adopt them. If you truly WANT to be these kids' father, I suggest perhaps going to therapy.

The director would be nice to your face, but behind doors she was a snake. They would trash-talk about people in other departments. Strict rules were made but they never followed them, yet my coworker was almost written up for breaking one. They pointed fingers, blaming everything on us ""grunts"" and created a ""them versus us"" mentality. Snitching other peoples' mistakes was encouraged. And if we were caught having lunch together, it was assumed we were planning a ""mutiny"". HR did nothing, basically blaming our department for the poor leadership. First the newest auditor left.
