It'd be a hassle, especially since your inventory would be restricted at the beginning of the game, but it can be done! You'd have to redo all of the plot again (starting villagers, rebuilding the various shops, the Able Sisters, Redd, Blathers, upgrading your home, etc.), but you can buy DIY recipes for your new character at the Nook's Cranny in your original game  - my friend helped me get a ladder within the first couple of days of me playing by inviting me to their island and letting me buy the recipe from Timmy and Tommy, so I'm assuming this works for all the other ones too.

As for the plot stuff I mentioned, you could probably time travel for that if you're not too opposed to it because waiting irl time for something you've already done is a pain in the ass.

I got the game less than a week ago but I like to think I'm doing decently well and have been progressing quickly (ie. got the game Sunday and am about to get Redd to visit my town tomorrow) so far, so if you need any Bells, recipes, fruits, etc if you get yourself your own Switch, then feel free to lmk and I'll try to help you out!

HPfanfiction,fqhjqdr,t1_fqh5e57,1589378372.0,"Alright, I'll explain to you how small words can impact a person. You seem pretty firm on your position, but for anyone else who is interested, I'll paint a picture for you.

Imagine that you're depressed. Your life drags on, you have no motivation, and you have no energy. You wonder what you're living for and don't have an answer other than simply saying that you have to keep going. When you finally go to the doctor to seek help, they diagnose you with depression. All of the emotions you've felt - the misery, the emptiness, the numb and cold reality that you endured - are now associated with that word. When you hear someone say the word ""depression"", your mind recalls the associations that you feel with that word, which would be the cold empty world you had come to hate.

Same thing with rape. You remember vividly how your body had been forced to endure pain that you'd never wanted simply because someone else wanted to derive pleasure from your suffering. When the police and first responders found you, you heard then saying that you were raped. The doctors say you were raped. Your new counselor says that you were raped. If you ever mention what you went through, you use the word rape. When you hear the word rape in any context, you immediately think back on how alone and afraid you felt as you screamed and begged for help and nobody came to help you until it was already over and you were crying in the aftermath.

The word ""rape"" was used in this comedy skit. For a majority of people, this doesn't mean anything. But for rape victims, many of them associate the word with the shame and pain they had felt. Rape is a ""trigger"" word, which activates a post traumatic response - PTSD . Just like how a veteran may be triggered by loud sounds that may sound similar to gunfire or explosions, words can also trigger PTSD. To prevent the victims of these events from having to endure that suffering, simply mentioning that words associated with trauma like ""rape"" and ""suicide"" are involved in a material can allow these people to avoid it and thus keep them mentally healthy without having to censor content to prevent these words from being you. It allows them to roam freely without being concerned that they might have to deal with their emotions going haywire and for everyone else to enjoy the comedy skit without having words that may be a trigger being omitted or censored. It's a healthy balance between censorship and freedom. This isn't very different than the warnings at the beginning of a movie stating that there is sexual content, gore, or violence. It helps people.

Hopefully this made things more clear for anyone interested."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fqf7c8c,t3_gi1tn3,1589319930.0,"Guess I'm going to be the outlier here, but...

I would say that if you're easily overwhelmed, don't. I personally enjoyed Skyrim, so when people were telling me how much I would love BotW, I was excited and bought it. I was into the game until the game told me to go to the shrines to find treasure and then get the paraglider and basically threw me into the map to find out where the shrines were myself. I'm shit at finding landmarks like that and am terrible at remembering where I've been or what I need to do without the game reminding me, so I was pretty miserable. I dreaded sitting down and playing because I knew I would struggle for a while. I even looked up a guide to make marks on the map as to where I was supposed to go and that didn't even really help. I have no idea why but I just felt stressed and overwhelmed when I would pick up the controller and I barely got through anything. 

When I play Skyrim, I choose which quests I want to do first, then find where they are on the map and follow that route but I also feel free to make deviations and do sidequests if I want. There's structure but also quite a bit of freedom. First bit of BotW did not give me that feeling. 

The main difference between BotW and Skyrim is that in Skyrim is just that Skyrim makes it easier for you to decide what you have to do and then do it rather than being a free-for-all like BotW. I SHOULD have forced myself to get through to the paraglider and play a bit after that because the feeling of the game likely changes quite a bit, but I dreaded sitting down to play even though I thought I'd eventually get into it, simply because it was just too much and didn't feel like any fun.

With that being said, I found that when my friend came over and we took turns playing, I felt far more at ease and relaxed. Wasn't nearly as stressful - most likely because I got breaks and had someone to goof off with. Friend also is very good with BotW and has played it a lot, so she was able to give me general advice as to what I should do. That's around when I realized why I didn't like the game very much and when I knew I wouldn't get into it. I ended up trading BotW in to get Pokemon Shield which, although many people are very critical of the SwSh games, I actually enjoyed a lot and have put 30x hours into compared to my BotW playtime, so it was worth the investment imo.

A majority of Switch players, however, rate BotW very highly and I can understand why, but the game just wasn't for me. Should I have given it more of a chance? Yes. But I played for several hours and just wasn't looking forward to it at all when I would sit down to play again. It was just collecting dust. So if anything I mentioned seems to be similar to what you would feel, I'd recommend against the purchase. Otherwise, I would seriously suggest buying the game - it clearly has effort put into it and its not one of the Switch's most popular games for absolutely no reason. Good luck with whichever choice you make!"
UNCCharlotte,fqek7sq,t1_fqdm785,1589308926.0,"As an incoming freshman, I like your idea far more than the one the school currently seems to be proposing. While yes, the beginning of the semester will be rough, the Chancellor should realize that the students who are currently in their senior year of high school that will be attending UNCC in the fall have already had to deal with the switch between in-person and online classes. 

Personally, I don't think it will be a big deal if we were to go online for the first few weeks, as this switch should be planned well in advance and students will know what to expect upon the change. The main difficulty with going online when the state cancelled schools for the current seniors was because it was such an abrupt cancellation - my classmates and I had mentioned the possibility of school being closed, but we all thought that they wouldn't consider it for at least another week. Everyone left textbooks, projects, and other items at school because no one expected it. There were no guidelines on grading for nearly two months and many teachers struggled with coming up with new lessons to adapt to the new environment, particularly teachers who relied on certain programs that were unavailable to the students at home.

If there are protocols established and adapted to our current situation in advance, then I believe the process will be far simpler for both students and staff just to simply go online rather than having the first two weeks off. The thought of having no breaks worries me, as that time is typically when I allow myself to rest, clear my mind, or occasionally catch up on work as well as spend time with my family. I know that myself and many others use that time to center ourselves so that we can perform better upon arriving back. 

Thank you for your dedication! I appreciate your thoughtfulness and your obvious compassion for the students. All I can say is to simply do your best to do what you think will be best for us and make sure to take care of yourself in the process. We appreciate your time and effort. :>"
InsanePeopleQuora,fqde1ld,t3_ghumis,1589287557.0,"For some reason, upon seeing this question, my immediate reaction was to assume the person asking was a writer. Why?

With the way the story was set up, I honestly thought they weren't going to continue the series! I legitimately figured that was the end. Couple of years later, I found out that it WASN'T over, around when Squirrelflight's Hope was gonna come out. When I found out about the continuation, I ended up browsing Warriors stuff (ie. excerpts, fanart, etc.) and was pretty fucking pissed at how (imo) they butchered Bramblestar's character to the point where he really isn't even the same as he was previously. Literally my favorite character along with Squirrelflight and the way their relationship turned out was a massive turnoff. 

There was so much potential for a really powerful couple where they balance out their weaknesses and boost their strengths that just... didn't happen. We could've had one of the strongest leader/deputy dynamics yet they gotta go and fuck both of their characters? Really? Nah, just gonna skip that. 

Sorry lads. I'll just read fanfiction, like [this one](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18509839/chapters/43865560). SO good, and I love all of the characters. Lowkey the reason why I like Tigerstar 1.0 is because of this fanfic - the latest chapter was SO GOOD and had my sitting on the edge of my seat in a way I'd forgotten. Every character feels exactly the way I imagined them to be and to top it all off there are time travel shenanigans. One of the best fanfics I've ever read and THE best Warriors one I know to date."

MadeMeSmile,foyooxz,t3_gabzf9,1588176339.0,"If anyone's wondering why I'm out during quarantine: don't worry! Long story short, I'm a senior in high school and my school is doing a drive-thru to get our cap and gowns.

Speaking of which, teachers are in their cars with banners and waving to everyone and congratulating us on our achievements, which also made me smile. Some of them I don't even know and they still waved to me when we drove by. It amazes me how caring they are. Kudos to them for their hard work and efforts today! We all appreciate it.

I keep editing this comment because I want people to know exactly how much our teachers have done for us. When we got to the line, my mom rolled down the window and said my last name and a teacher went and got my package and handed it to me, then told me to put on my cap. I did, and two people with masks on came up to our window with a frame and I had my picture taken. They were doing this for every student. They had us exit through the bus parking lot, where parents had hung posters on the buses with their child's name on it and some put pictures, some said 'honk for so and so', some were simply general congratulations to the Class of 2020. There were also signs in the lawn that said 'congratulations to so and so' and there were even banners on the school that praised certain teachers and the seniors as well.

It was really a trip down memory lane. I had a teacher who I had twice - once for freshman English, once for Creative Writing in my sophomore year - walk alongside our car and congratulate me personally and wish me luck.

I really am thankful to my school. While I probably won't have a normal graduation, these memories will be truly unique and notable when compared with others, and I appreciate that the administration really went the extra mile here. They had to do none of this - our caps and gowns could have just been shipped to our homes - but instead they made it as positive, safe, and enjoyable as possible. 

I want people to know how hard many schools are attempting to make things as positive as possible for their graduating students. And I want them to be recognized for their hard work. Students forget that everyone is doing the best they can considering the circumstances.

I mean, if we're willing to kill each other, then why would aliens want to interact with us? If I was an alien, I wouldn't want to interact with a civilization or species who killed each other over mere differences - what would they do to ME? Especially if the aliens aren't humanoid, don't speak our language, or have differences in opinions and culture. Can you imagine how terrifying it would be? Humans could turn on you easily and are so passionate in their emotions, both positive and negative. When you think about it, many humans are volatile and unpredictable. That uncertainty would certainly stop many civilizations from reaching out to Earth.

Oh yeah, and the fact that we're split into many different countries, all with differing ideas and morals, will definitely make it difficult for aliens. What if Australia accepts them, but America denies them and refuses to interact? How do the aliens determine who to meet with or who to side with? Politicians would suck their potentially nonexistent dicks and kiss the ground they stand on to gain their support because if aliens were able to come here first, that means they're more technologically advanced that humans. This means that they would make good allies during war situations and would be a trump card that could be pulled to easily turn the tide of victory. 

Aliens don't want to deal with beings who would manipulate and lie to them to gain their help and support. Having a single government for the entire world population would simplify things greatly for the aliens, but my previous point still stands: Any species that is remotely intelligent or enlightened will view us as barbaric and uncultured."

My teacher has his family walking around sometimes and its really sweet tbh, he and his wife are so wholesome with each other.

I did have a hard time not laughing during class the other day though when my dad gave me watered-down apple juice instead of giving it to my sister.

This means that they're not depressed all the time, but they can go through the typical symptoms (loss of interest in hobbies, insomnia, self-esteem drops, lack of motivation, numbness, suicidal ideation etc.) for several weeks or months when something that causes them sadness or stress occurs in their life.

Citra,fndr64x,t3_g163k5,1586875928.0,"Do me a favor and look at the files that you recreated the rom from. Specifically, look into the folder that should be called ExtractedExeFS. There should be a file in there called code.bin. When changing the contents of the rom (ie randomizing), that will be changed to .code.bin. You need to remove that first period so that it's code.bin - .code.bin isn't recognized by Citra and will cause it to crash. If that was the problem, rebuild the rom again and try loading it and it should work!

If that's not it, then I'm afraid that I don't really know. I'd try to re-randomize the rom and rebuild it again."

ALS,fna0ug1,t3_fzqcv7,1586788821.0,"As others have said, it's ultimately her choice. From personal experience, I can only tell you that things will get worse. With ALS, it isn't whether someone will get worse, but how quickly that will happen. It seems like your mother has been through a lot in the past several months. In my experiences, prolonged hospital visits like that typically signal a person reaching the end of their life.

With that being said, has anyone in your family remembered her saying anything in the past about her opinion on being on machines to live? When my grandfather was found to have ALS, we all knew immediately that he would NEVER want to be on a ventilator - not only because he's expressed that opinion in the past, but also just how he is as a person. He's stubborn, proud, and independent. A ""man's man"". When he choked and had to go to the hospital and his heart stopped, we knew it was time to let him go because we knew that was what he would have wanted. He was just that kind of guy.

So if your mother is present enough to make that choice, I would simply support her through that the best you can. It's all you can really do. If she still has a significant other, that person may know best what she would've wanted the most. I would suggest talking to them if possible. Best of luck!"

HPfanfiction,fn9w85g,t1_fn9vk4t,1586786002.0,"You're right about that, my bad! Thanks for the correction! I was thinking about the cloak for whatever reason when I was making note of Gryffindor's heirlooms. Was thinking about the Deathly Hallows trio there now that I consider it. You're also probably right with noting that everyone is distantly related to each founder, although there were obviously other pureblooded wizards and witches that attended Hogwarts at that point, considering that Slytherin was making comments about muggleborns. I'd definitely assume that there are descendants of each house, although the main question would be who is the closest linked family to each founder. I think everything else I said mostly stands, but you were right on that."
HPfanfiction,fn9uqds,t1_fn9r7wb,1586785020.0,"I'm pretty sure that it's been stated somewhere in the books that Harry can speak parseltongue because of him having a piece of Voldemort's soul, not due to lineage. Lily is Muggleborn and there's no way that she has Slytherin blood, whereas the Potters are descended from Gryffindor and are often known to be sorted into that house. I doubt that the bloodlines of Gryffindor and Slytherin would merge with the Potters - then we would see more signs of dark magic within that family. The Potters are known for being accepting and open of muggleborns and creatures like werewolves, which Slytherin would greatly disagree with. If the Potters were in his bloodline, he'd probably be writhing in his grave.

As for mentioning that parseltongues aren't exclusively Slytherin's bloodline, I found out that you were correct with that, at least if we look at Fantastic Beasts. It's noted that the first basilisks were bred by Herpo the Foul, who was a dark wizard from Greece and also knew parseltongue (he also created the first horcrux). However, aside from him and Harry, who can be linked to Voldemort, all other known parseltongue speakers are linked to Slytherin. Although it could potentially be guessed that Herpo is one of Slytherin's ancestors, we don't know that for certain, so that's really just me guessing.

If you want my opinion on this, then I'm guessing that it's a mutation that occurs in families who tamper in the Dark Arts - that's what all of these individuals have in common (aside from Harry). However, if that was the case, then why were the Malfoys not parselmouths? The Blacks? And if it wasn't hereditary, nor linked to dark magic, how come there were absolutely no other known students who could speak parseltongue before Harry's time at Hogwarts aside from Voldemort?

Plus, if the Gaunts aren't from Slytherin, then how did they get his amulet? I don't see an ancient heirloom like that being lost or removed from the family."
HPfanfiction,fn9qx7z,t1_fn9q5td,1586782260.0,"Isn't it proven that the Gaunts were related to Slytherin since Tom Riddle could speak parseltongue? Since one has to be a heir of Slytherin (or a horcrux of the Dark Lord) to naturally have the ability to speak with snakes, it would mean that the Gaunts were indeed descendants of Slytherin."

He was a good deputy and loyal to his clan - while he's had some thoughts and doubts, in the end he's always chosen his clan over his blood. He denied Tigerstar's offer and killed Hawkfrost twice. When the truth came out about the three, while he ignored Squirrelflight, he never was malicious or cruel to her. The fact that he seems to treat Squirrelflight poorly, imposter aside, is just destroying his character that has been built up from the beginning of the series. It feels like as if they're writing a completely different character. This is why I've been completely unable to read the latest books - sucks to see a character you enjoyed be turned one-dimensional like that."

So, my thought process. I saved right before I battled him, went in blind, and then got wrecked. I thought about my options and changed my plans as I found flaws in them. First, I tried Pidgeot in the lead to harshly lower his Attack, but he would always die to Stone Edge to the first turn except for one time where Stone Edge missed. I moved Mightyena to the front to see if I could lower his accuracy first to give Pidgeot more room to lower his attack, but he could never live past the first attack to get a Sand Attack off. Finally, I remembered that Primarina had Baby-Doll Eyes and got a single move before she died. This happened so many times until I realized I had three Telluric Seeds. So I equipped them to all three of my major players. It gave Primarina just enough padding to survive the first hit and pull off a second turn, which enabled Mightyena to come in and lower accuracy until she fainted. Once Mightyena went down, Pidgeot came in to do what he could with lowering his attack and even managed to survive a Stone Edge. Meowstic was my pivot to revive and heal Primarina. Camerupt and Manectric were just chilling together.

Primarina was the key here, but Pidgeot and Mightyena were also essential and they aren't considered very useful aside for sweeping the enemy's team, which was impossible here. Using an ""average"" team doesn't mean that it's impossible to beat Solaris - you just have to plan a lot and rely on lucky rolls."

There are ways for them to at least learn some semblance of control, though??? Tantrums and crying will most likely happen with severely autistic children because mentally they're like toddlers. So when you take care of them, that's how you have to treat them. That's just part of having family with mental disabilities like that.

Long story time, buckle up.

I have a younger, severely autistic sister. I help my parents take care of her - I give her meals and I'm  just trying to be positive and smile at her more than I did previously because her routine has been fucked up due to COVID. We're all doing alright, but the lack of structure makes her more cranky than usual, in case anyone happens to be wondering.

She can't bathe herself. If we let her make her own meals, she'd eat an entire pound of cheese if we let her (and still would). She couldn't get dressed by herself for years, and even now we have to check to make sure she didn't put her pants or shirt on backwards or inside out. When she was younger, she would scream and physically charge at you when you would say no or something she didn't like. She got in trouble at school for kicking and biting other students and I think she kicked or bit a teacher once? I could never leave my room unlocked ever because she would go into it no matter whether the door was shut or not - she went into my closet one day and found some type of dye that I was going to use for a shirt and the kid dumped it on the playroom floor and permanently stained it. NEVER have I seen my father THAT furious. She's broken plenty of my stuff, like books and toys. My mother has cried because my sister has broken her jewelry, and my father got upset when she spilled apple juice onto his PS4 controller, and I bawled when I found out she'd torn up some of my childhood books and completely ruined them. She'd break into the pantry and steal tons of food - entire loaves of bread, boxes of cookies, and she's stolen a lot of my Halloween candy plenty of times. 

I mean, it was bad. 

The doctors said she would never talk and never get a job. Things were looking pretty dim. My parents were struggling with controlling her and teaching her how to function at least a little. As a child, I never acted out and was always quiet and polite at school because I didn't want to cause my parents any trouble, so I never told them about any of my problems. It was rough for my parents, rough for her teachers, and rough for me. And I couldn't talk to anyone else about it and have them understand.

But with several amazing teachers and discipline, my sister is far better than she was as a child several years ago. She still fusses and whines occasionally, gives us the Look when we say no (which is more cute than anything tbh), and will throw tantrums. But she doesn't hit, she doesn't bite, she doesn't kick, she doesn't scream, she doesn't stomp around. She said her first couple of words when she was about 8 years old and started forming proper sentences when she was about 13-14. Whenever my parents or myself is upset now, she'll approach us and tell us ""happy?"" and proceed to try and hug us to make us feel better. She knows how to say excuse me, thank you, and please. And she can request things in full sentences. She won't talk unless we engage her or unless she wants something, but that is STILL WAY BETTER than we'd originally thought.

She stopped breaking into my room because we would scold her when she did. She stopped breaking into my parents room because we would take her iPad when she did. The only reason she stopped stealing food is because we got a lock for the pantry and a bicycle lock for the fridge and she still takes food if we leave anything unlocked, but we'll ignore that lol.

Now her teachers say she could potentially get a job doing filing and other organizing work. She's improving even further with her vocabulary and is talking more and more. She's 16 years old and has proved the doctors wrong. 

It is POSSIBLE to discipline an autistic child, no matter how severe it is. My sister will never be independent or live on her own because hers is that severe - eventually, she'll have to go to a group home for people with special needs (still a topic of debate between my parents on what she'll do after graduating from her school at 21 instead of 18, which is neat). But we've taught her over the years how to control her emotions better, how to read and do math and even some history and science, and how to ask for things instead of pointing and knock before entering. WITHOUT professional therapy, by the way, so its not like we spent a ton of money to get her to where she is either.

There are still things we need to improve on, like waiting patiently, not refusing to do work because its difficult, and abandonment anxiety. She's improved so much and I'm so fucking proud of her. When I was a child, I didn't like her too much because I felt like I was ignored by my parents due to her. But now I realize she was the best sister I could've asked for. And it took a lot of effort to get where we are now and I'm certain my parents must have gotten close to giving up sometimes and I know they have both cried due to the stresses that she brings and both have snapped at her some days just because she can be so much - hell, I'm guilty of it too when I was watching over her in the summers since I was about 13 - but we pushed through it all. And though there are two siblings rather than one, there are ways to get around it.

OP is NTA. Although I think that OP should try to help out their parents a little with discipline or caretaking if their mental health is well enough to handle it, they should 100% have a place that is entirely their space and their siblings should understand that they cannot enter that space without getting in trouble. My room is my space where I go in and listen to music and know that I can catch a break from my family and let myself relax without having to watch after my sister and make sure she's not getting into things that she shouldn't. It's the place where I drop all thoughts of my sister and simply focus on myself. 

The parents should ask some close friends or family if they can help them out, or perhaps reach out to the several groups or societies that deal with autism and similar mental disabilities. A lot of them offer support services, and you may be able to get childcare, learning services, or support that way. Also try to talk to some of their teachers if they go to a school specifically for students with special needs. One of my sister's assistant teachers offered to take my sister out a couple of times to do things like go to the park, go bowling, etc. My parents wanted to pay him like ~$50-100 dollars per outing but they just didn't have the money so they weren't able to do it. But maybe OP's family is in a better position? Therapy is also an option but its ridiculously expensive and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really well off imo. Having two autistic siblings definitely makes these options a little harder to do, but its still possible with some determination and effort.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I think its wrong to say that autistic people - even severe cases - generally can't improve with listening to orders. Most can improve with almost anything if they get some help, support, and discipline. Also I love my little sister and just wanted to brag about how much she's improved. Fun fact, she's been learning about the solar system recently and can tell you all of the planets and it's kinda cute I'm not gonna lie."

If they're wrong, tell them why. If I was wrong about something, I would WANT someone to give me the real facts so that I can better educate myself and others! Telling someone to ""shut up"" never helps, and it only makes people more hostile and further ingrains their opinions, no matter how wrong they may be. Even if you have a point, or if you were right, many people might ignore you simply because of your ""attitude"". Just ignore them if you have nothing constructive to say or if they seem not to want the facts.

If someone does not want the truth even when you show it to them with facts and proof, that is when they go from simply being ignorant to being an idiot that needs to shut up. :p"

nuzlocke,fijs89n,t3_f88gdh,1582462146.0,"Personally, I wouldn't replace anyone with Impidimp yet - Fairy does normal damage to other Fairy-types, meaning that Impidimp is weak to Fairy because of his Dark-typing. I would wait until after the gym for him. I feel like he could replace your Stunky, but idk. Skuntank can be REALLY strong if you use it properly, and its typing helps it only take neutral damage (or, in the case of psychic, NO damage) to things it would have been weak to if it was a pure typing. But Impidimp is also really useful. I'd try using both of them separately and see which one you like after Opal.

As for Cufant, I feel like Arctozolt may be a bit redundant with the types it covers and depending on your version of the game, Gordie would cause some issues with Arctozolt on the team and I don't think he'd have any uses in the near future. Granted, Cufant would also cause some issues, but it'll be useful for right now at the very least. So I'd switch out Arctozolt for at least the gym.
