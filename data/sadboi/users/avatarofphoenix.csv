You want a reason to live? 

1. Regression to the mean. Its a statistics thing that I find often valid. In this case it just means bad things dont last. When you are way down, it tends to not last. Its worth a try...

2. Somebody might miss you. Dont you have anyone that cares?

3. Maybe you are wrong...many depressed people think things that arent necessarily true. It can get better if you be kind to yourself and work on it. I'm not extraordinary at all and I did it. You certainly can too. 

Please dont do it. Call or talk to someone, even if its a suicide hotline."
depression,fpxyvbp,t3_gg7619,1588992413.0,"There doesn't have to be a point to life. 

You don't have to have a grand plan or a magical destiny. 

You didn't choose to be here, but you are. 

That is reason enough to exist, imo. 

You are here, so enjoy it. Let yourself experience every moment to the best of your ability, whatever that is. Theres no one right answer, just what works for you. 

Take it from a college science major who got really depressed and almost committec suicide.

20 years later qnd things are much better. Why? I just kept going and did the best I could.

I hope you can too. All the angst isnt worth it. Please be well and dont be so hard on yourself. You dont have to answer all those questions."

depression,fip5bfu,t3_f92zlt,1582598362.0,"When she wants to talk, listen without judging. 

Don't try to tell her what to do, how to be, or to just get over it. She is probably so hard on herself that none of that would help. 

Depression can often be helped by stating when is going on in someones head. That can be out loud, on paper, or whatever gets a person to honestly think about what they are experiencing and stating it in a way they can analyze. A little distance from yourself can let you see that what you are thinking is harmful or just plain wrong. 

I wish I knew enough about the situation to be more specific. With me, I needed to be more patient and accepting of myself and my flaws, realize that other people would be there for me no matter what, and accept that no matter how low I was, the potential was there to recover. 

No sugar coated fake motivational happiness. No encouragement to just get over it. Self acceptance helps lead to self empowerment. I hope it helps. Good luck. Dont give up on her,"
