There are some aspects you need to consider before bringing this subject to your partner:
- Don't bring it up immediately before or after sex. This may lead to a quick escalation on both parts. Find a time when you are both calm and explain to your partner what you need during sex.
- As this is a sensitive matter for most people try to avoid confrontational sentences and focus on what you feel would be better for you.
- Sometimes is good to get back to basics and explore non genital sexuality. You can schedule moments of shared pleasure in which the goal is not to orgasm, but to explore each other bodies commenting on what feels good for you. This will help develop a more intimate experience and also a easier communication during sex.
- Finally, you should never do anything that make you uncomfortable, but if you also enjoy the kinkier side of sex you should explain to your partner that although you enjoy it is not enough for you."
