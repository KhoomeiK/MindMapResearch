It sounds like you seem fine in that department so that's good. One idea that immidiately popped into my head is that she takes a bath in a tub, with a bath bomb, and you massage her head and maybe otherwise if she wants you to. Scented candles might be a good idea too. Or just a full on bathhouse vacation."

My very over-analyticalN anxious and autistic brain wants to insist that yes it does, it tells that you have bad hand to eye co-ordination and that means you're bad at something and you should feel ashamed about being bad at something. 😅 

And for example, let's say that the target you're missing is somewhere very few people miss, maybe to the point it would be considered almost impossible to do so. Let's also assume that missing this target has great precations and missed the opportunity to win. What then?"
therapy,fk4zsf5,t3_fgjhjn,1583870748.0,You can come talk to me if you need someone to vent to or talk in general.
therapy,fk4zmr9,t3_fgjhjn,1583870661.0,"That sounds really rough... I think your previous therapist was incompetent, kicking you out rather than helping and/or trying to calm you down when you were clearly in a state of distress, especially if she knew you had trouble with that. I can see how the voices and such could indeed be something else than schitzophrenia, but I definetly wouldn't rule that out as an option without investigation. It definetly sounds like you were severly affected and traumatized by your fathers untimely passing and possibly some other things. Try and not invalidate yourself, comparing your struggles to someone elses is very toxic and other peoples struggles don't de-value your struggles. We all stuggle in different form and with differing levels of hardness. I saw a quote just a little while ago ""whether or not you're drowing in 10ft or 1ft of water doesn't matter, you're both still drowning"" I highly suggest you try and make an appointment to a doctor and try and start the process trying to discover exactly what mental illnesses you have."

The worst thing is I have absolutely zero clue as to what the source of this insecurity is, and it stops me from advancing almost completely.

AskReddit,fd2b6nk,t3_ejr5rg,1578144624.0,"I once started crying during class, because I was very depressed and an oversensitive person. I was crammed into a room with 25 people that are loud and working on an school art piece I just couldn't get right, it had to be the same as the image in my mind but my stupid human hands weren't capable of that, still I tried. I just started crying out of frustration and disappointment, overwhelmed by my surroundings, causing a sensory overload as well as emotional breakdown by my inner turmoil. 

I think I thought that what if I just exploded? Pinned down one of the classmates that was always quietly judging me, flinging desks and chairs screaming. I think It might've occured to me only way after though, what if I did that.

What I do remember feeling for sure was embarrased and cornered, I pulled my hoodie hood over my head and hid my face as well as I could, burying it in the wall and crying silently. I remember thinking it was odd that no one reacted, no one commented anything, tried to comfort me, or mock me. Just silence. 

Nowadays I understand why that would happen, but yeah. I was probably like 13 or smth."

Your husband is clearly out of line, and you ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING PROGRESSIVE. You need to talk with your son, and then to your husband. Drag him to that therapy if that's what it takes because HE CLEARLY NEEDS IT AND SO WILL HIS SON AFTER THIS. Assert yourself more for gods sake. It doesn't matter at this point whether or not you will ""wound his masculinity"" because he's already past that point when he started this mindless verbal abuse. You have to stop it in it's tracks when he attempts it. A simple no, and a stern look seems like an effective tactic. The fact that I'm even needing to explain to you all this is ridicilous. You are an indivudual that has the right to do what they want, and if that something is something your husband happens to not approve of that shouldn't stop you from making decisions. You are clearly under his thumb, and/or have a meek personality. Don't just jokingly ""intercept"" be serious about it, and talk in a serious and clear manner about the situation. This is toxic-masculinity at it's greatest."
