AskReddit,flene9m,t3_fo7bnm,1585087719.0,"my high school is falling apart. I mean we had ceiling tiles fall all over the place (one even fell on a kids head), we couldn‚Äôt use a bathroom or our I hall every time it would rain because the whole hallway would flood cause of all of the leaks, and it had a huge cockroach problem that affected the food and our lockers. I have a tour to a bunch of alumni who graduated in the 50‚Äôs and it said it looked the exact same, down to the floor tiles and even recalled having some of the same issues when they were in school. 

I live in a pretty affluent area, and my mom is a member of the school board, and knows the person in charge of the finances. Instead of saving up to have our school rebuilt because of all the issues, our superintendent decided to give himself a pay raise and take away from the funds of the school and decrease the salary of the teachers so he would get more money. 

Everyone complains about the school and they‚Äôve brought up the issues about it for years, but he‚Äôs done nothing to help with the issue. Instead, he decided that we needed a memorial for the troops, in a location that no one would see it, and cost almost $40000 to complete. I would be all for it, but it‚Äôs getting to the point where going to the school is a safety hazard, and i think that students safety is more important than building a memorial.

Everyone hates it, and it‚Äôs become controversial because if you say something, they‚Äôll automatically assume you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù and ‚Äúhate America‚Äù"

It could sound like your girlfriend is showing signs/symptoms of depression, and is struggling with the fact that she‚Äôs not going to have the closest people in her life as often as she wants to. She might be pulling away because she doesn‚Äôt want to hold you back in school and wants the best for you and her friend. The least amount of people she has surrounding her means that she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about letting anyone down.  She also might be doing it subconsciously, meaning that she might not know that she‚Äôs making herself feel more alone. I know you two are broken up, but if you think that this may be a root cause, check up on her and make sure that she‚Äôs okay, and that although you two are broken up, that you are someone she can talk to if she needs anything (of course if you feel comfortable with doing that)"
