My anxiety and PTSD nightmares and flashbacks of were happening a lot and I just wasn’t sleeping or eating well because of it all. At the end of moving most of our stuff in, I was on my way to the new house from the old one super late at night and just me and my dog when this song came on that just really expressed how down I was feeling. I actually let myself feel it for a second and get that emotion out. Right when I got home, I was moving some stuff and found some notes from my therapist. Being reminded of the coping methods she’s taught me and that it’s okay to feel this way really helped me and was very comforting. 

Since that moment, I’ve found notes from her and my bass teacher during some low points that have really helped me through them. It’s funny how that works, but I’m very grateful"

My boyfriend has never been to therapy but we are about to start going as a couple soon and I’m hoping it will convince him to start his own therapy journey. His family suppressed emotion in general and are kind of cold. They never knew that he’s been in a constant anxiety state since he was an early teen. And that he struggles with depression. He’s my rock through all of my struggles and I’m terrified of adding onto his baggage while going through my own stuff because he never learned coping skills either. So we’ve been working on communication. 

He struggles a lot with recognizing his thoughts and emotions and I think a lot of it comes from his family. But maybe that’s me slightly projecting from all my shit coming from mine lol I’m just trying to be a good partner and help him through it. It’s just a weird thing for me because sometimes we’re anxious at the same time, or he wants to comfort me but I have such a fear of men I don’t communicate what’s going on for him to know what I need. So then I just box him out on accident. We’ve got to learn to handle all of it and me just recently starting to question my sexuality and it being kind of a can of worms.

I couldn’t keep secrets of my past even though it was before us. Like me sleeping with a friend in between my last break up and us dating. It was ripping me apart. I can’t remember quite how he handled it but he made me know I didn’t need to. He told me something along the lines of you may need to say it to me but I don’t need to hear it. It dissipated after that. 

When it comes to your situation, I think the needing to relieve the anxiety is necessary but you don’t need to know the circumstances. So I would have him journal it.

Also, children mimic behavior. So it makes sense that you would have these kinds of intrusive thoughts, in a way.

But you’re afraid of being a bad person and hurting someone like you were hurt. But you didn’t do anything wrong. I had these same kind of thoughts and being scared of myself for a while until I learned to deal with it. Your mother didn’t handle the situation right by not telling you.

adultsurvivors,foqzqmd,t3_g8yegg,1588003672.0,"Hey there. I know how hard the confusion is when you first find out. For me it was repressed memories resurfacing. And then realizing I was also hyper sexual and how much that affected my life and lead to more trauma. 

The only thing that really helped me is therapy. Seeing a trauma trained therapist. Having her help me figure my stuff out. Learn to cope with it and grow from it. Also going to therapy and doing the trauma work might trigger things to come up. And if that happens that’s okay. There’s ways to deal with that. 

There’s no gate keeping in this community. You don’t have to prove anything, or feel inadequate in any way whatsoever. What you went through is real. It’s not easy to accept and it can be very scary. Helping each other through this is why we’re here, not to gate keep. 

If you ever want to reach out and talk about it, my DMs are open. Maybe I can help you find someone in your area to talk to. 

I’m sorry you had to feel so alone with questioning if it happened or not and your mom not being honest with you until now. Not having control over your own situation can be difficult. But right now, I guess in a way the ball is in your court. And you made the right move by reaching out with this post to ask for help. Seriously, that is important.

actuallesbians,fn71xf5,t3_fztitr,1586711704.0,"I have a matching ice pack to the meme on my knee, jamming to some thundercat and doing a Harry Potter cross stitch until I feel like pulling out my bass. If not for the ice pack being needed, I would be completely content because I’m such an introvert. This is definitely how I like to spend my Sundays. But also reddit to see the pretty girls"
AskReddit,fn5bgop,t1_fn4h64w,1586660566.0,My mom is fucking nuts and she does shit like this. She has no sense of consequences and will try to lie her way out of everything. Not even sure she knows she’s lying or not. She possibly believes her own lies. She has BPD and refuses treatment. It’s just too much to deal with

amiugly,fn43pu4,t3_fyuj6d,1586633434.0,I think you’re very cute and I really like your style. You look like a laid back dude who would be great to have a conversation with. Maybe a mix of introvert extrovert. Shit can be hard when we’re all quarantined and it can be hard on mental health and self esteem. I don’t think you need to change anything about your look. Hope you get to feeling better
