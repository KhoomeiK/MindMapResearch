neither of you are wrong for how you’re feeling, it just sounds like you both want different things that your current life style isn’t capable of catering to imo. i definitely believe you should be 100% honest so he has closure and can do his best to move on without wondering what he did wrong, and allowing his mind to wonder and blame it on every insecurity he can think of. 

you don’t have to be blunt or offensive with it. just be honest and compassionate. let him know that although you still care about him, it’s not feasible to maintain the relationship because you are exhausted and incapable of taking care of yourself and the relationship on top of your job and general life."

for instance, being bi isnt much different than someone having two favorite colors or books. 

he hid his sexuality from you because he clearly has struggled in feeling comfortable with it. don’t consider it lying to you, but more of him lying or hiding from himself due to social stigma. feel sorrow and love for him bc of that struggle, don’t feel betrayed by it."
askwomenadvice,eszql9m,t3_c9m6gc,1562366268.0,"he never did anything wrong. his sexual endeavors were before y’all were even official. him being bi is literally perfectly fine and shouldn’t affect your relationship for absolutely any reason. being lgbt and hiding it is so much deeper than “lying.” it’s growing up with a stigma toward your sexuality and learning to feel the need to hide it because you’re afraid of the social backlash. i feel like this is often even worse for men than it is for bisexual women like me. there’s such a huge stigma for men who are bi— bisexuality already feels like the “prove yourself” sexuality, let alone for men."

i cant begin to express how much youtube tutorials helped me— there’s a plethora for all sorts of art and mediums. keep your practice sheets, doodles, sketches, and even the art you think turns out terribly. it will be a great way for you to look back and see progress. it’s easy to feel like we aren’t improving if we don’t have a comparison to go by. art is so fluid and accepting, you can make absolutely anything your own. good luck on your journey, and i hope it’s a good one !"
