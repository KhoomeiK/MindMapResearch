MedicalGore,fe3paka,t3_ec5rx7,1578851592.0,"Intestinal malrotation occurs during fetal development. The subsequent dysmotility progressed over time and the chronic pseudo obstructions caused further progressive damage to the muscles, nerves and structure that did not respond to conservative treatment. Autonomic dysfunction also plays a role from the intermittent twisting that occurred before a previous surgery that repaired the impaired blood flow. I have no bladder problems thankfully, and the hysterectomy was due to pelvic floor congestion, cysts, heavy bleeding, and a really bad case of postpartum hemorrhage. It was best to remove it to prevent further complications that may arise that would require further abdominal surgery. The cysts are not known why they occur but are common in malrotation patients."

My body thinks it’s a twist blocking the way and goes into overdrive trying to clear the obstruction, this happens a LOT and is extremely painful. It causes a lot of bacteria imbalances etc so yes diet is important! I’ve figured out which foods are best, which digest easier, which feed bad bacteria, and which provide the most nutritional calories because I can’t eat a whole lot. Can’t say it was easy, it’s been extremely difficult managing my diet because I do love eating and food so much, it was really hard for me to accept. What kind of diet do you find works for you?"

MedicalGore,fba7l28,t1_fb9r7y0,1576668603.0,"Awesome profession to pick! I’m an RN also, so my oddities and patient experience are always a bonus when caring for patients. You can shower with an ostomy bag on, usually you take a blow dryer to it after to dry it off. A lot of people enjoy bagless showers—which I can confirm are amazing! Water doesn’t hurt the stoma at all, it’s a naturally moist mucous membrane to begin and water won’t get inside. I have had a colectomy, which includes ileocecal anastamosis, additionally I don’t have an ileocecal valve. It’s pretty interesting you ask about placement because with intestinal malrotation all my colon was on the left and all the small on the right, free-floating, without mesentery to hold them up. The CC team has a procedure where they remove the whole intestines and replace as they would a transplanted organ, suturing into place and repairing mesentery, etc. Very cool surgery—12 hours long (this was 2 surgeries ago)! And yes I do still have a rectum, if I did not, I would have had a proctocolectomy, affectionally referred to as a “Barbie butt.” Which is for people with end ostomies and who have diseases like Crohns that affects even the rectal tissue. Don’t apologize for asking good questions, that’s what will make you a great nurse!!!"

Regardless of all that prep, it’s overwhelming at times. I get so nervous about skin breakdown, but it just takes close monitoring and finding what products and appliances work best for you. Online support groups are a great place to go to if you ever consider one, you will learn a lot about what it’s like.

MedicalGore,fb9eje1,t1_fb9dw9k,1576636497.0,"Well every problem I have has been a result of a defect that occurred during fetal development of the intestines. Around 12 weeks the intestines must go through a series of rotations as they make their way from the umbilical cord into their final position. When they do not you have what’s called intestinal malrotation. This causes all sorts of issues and many times it’s immediately known after birth due to twisting and necrosis. Some of us make it into adulthood without knowing though, and I didn’t begin having problems or discover I had it until about 7 years ago. It caused twisting, scar tissue, malformations, compromised blood supply, and progressive neuromuscular dysfunction that acted the ability of the intestines to function. Despite being under the care of some of the best intestinal transplant teams, unfortunately my intestines are just failing from all the years of stress, inflammation, and dysmotility. The idea now is just preserve function as long as possible by reducing the stress on them."
