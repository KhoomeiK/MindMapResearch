Love is not the only saving grace in a relationship. Trust is not here, compromise is not here, respect is not here, just from this small glimpse into your world..

You cannot take responsibility for someone else's emotions or feelings. It is NOT your responisbility to make ANYONE happy but YOU.

Regret is a fickle thing. 6 years of broken promises and obstinence would make for a lot of regret...

Do you regret feeling hopeful every time his words didn't meet his actions?

Do you regret trusting him when he repeatedly disappoints you?

Do you regret agreeing to stay when you see him fall into the same pattern as before?


Would you truly regret staying where you are unhappy?


I say all of this in concern, for life is short and while regrets are difficult to live with, living a life you are not happy in will most likely be the biggest regret of all.

Good for you. 

From this perspective I do not see how he has positively tried to contribute to solve the communication issue you two are having. I agree with you, it is a personal problem that he feels as if he doesn't have a girlfriend because quite frankly, he doesn't treat you as such.

AmItheAsshole,fg8o0qz,t3_exkch3,1580626084.0,"I'm going with NTA- you two communicated the whole time, and you were honest with him. While you originally agreed, you felt bad on Friday, and you can't be expected to help someone else recharge when you're drained. 
He changed up the days on you several times in the beginning too, so you both seemed unsure anyway."

trees,fg8n27z,t3_exjijl,1580625010.0,"When I had my own apartment we had a 4/20 party. Everyone brought food and weed. We had joints, blunts, bongs and pipes going around a circle of 15 people in a tiny living room. We were planning to play a murder mystery game but we had such a good time just smoking and hanging out we never did. It was great lol"

I hope you can back off of it, usually about 2 weeks is a good sobering period, and when you go back in try to set some moderation for yourself. Good luck, hope to hear how it goes for you OP"
trees,fg8mppl,t3_ewyqre,1580624632.0,I have to do it this way- otherwise I'm the complete opposite of productive in all the adult ways. Lol Treat yo self
TrueOffMyChest,fg86da7,t3_exh4zl,1580610717.0,"I'm heartbroken to read this dude. I can't imagine what you're going through, while I caught my ex talking to other girls I have no actual proof that he was physical with him...
It seems like you have met a master manipulator, as far as bringing it up to her I have no idea how to frame that subject. Considering she's been with several other people on several different occasions, it definitely needs to be brought up because she could be harboring an STI. I wish you the best of luck with this OP."
unpopularopinion,ffqtwyj,t1_ffqt7ym,1580143552.0,"I'm 25 onto 26 this year and know little next to nothing about politics and economics and they run the country. I said for years I wasn't into politics until I read something: Your boss is. Your landlord is. Etc. We want change, we have to work for it. And extra hard at that because like I said, we have to tear down the shit that has been put in place to temporarily better others. As we grow and evolve as a nation, our laws and regulations should too."
unpopularopinion,ffqswbz,t1_ffqsdq1,1580142886.0,"Do I vote? No, but this is a realization I'm coming to. That I need to be more involved in these choices because it effects me.  They tell you that your vote doesn't matter because that's what they want you to believe. Play their game, but be better at it than them."
unpopularopinion,ffqsoy2,t1_ffqsdq1,1580142752.0,"I get tired of it too, because we can do something about it of we educate ourselves and vote on local things, like bills and taxes passed in our counties/states. It's a lot of work to undo the greedy corruption but I can be done."
