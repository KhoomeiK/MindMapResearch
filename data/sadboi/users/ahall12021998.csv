I also said that he didn't get to act the way he was because I was sitting there giving him time when he chose to give me none for 16 years.

She says It pointed at her, said MY name, and just watched her. I woke up to her fingernails in my skin as she was clenching my arm shaking saying, ""abrial, abrial, abrial look. Abrial"" but when I turned to look there was nothing there. She had a full blown panic attack at 11 years old. At the time we didn't know whatthe fuck was wrong she wouldnt stop shaking so i woke my mom up and she said to run a cold bath bath and call her mom. 20 minutes later her mother was there to pick her up, in the middle of the night, and we had sleepovers at her house from then on."
