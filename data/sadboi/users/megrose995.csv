I think that mine are rooted in the idea that all of these terrible things that have happened to me must be my fault, because if they weren‚Äôt I‚Äôd have to accept that terrible things can just happen to a person for no reason, and that terrified me more. I wish I had more solid advice for you than to just keep going, but I don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôve been raped a number of times throughout my life, and I‚Äôm currently working through narrative therapy that is helping me place each trauma within a timeline that I can follow. I often feel like if I can just say the ‚Äúthing‚Äù, talk about the flashback, whatever it is, that I will finally feel like I‚Äôll be allowed to heal, that I‚Äôll deserve it.

I had a big breakthrough last week during my session, though. I realized that there isn‚Äôt anything standing in the way between me and compassion for myself, love for myself, belief in my experiences and my own pain. There isn‚Äôt anything *truly* in your way, any one obstacle or therapeutic achievement that has to be met before you can feel better. You just have to approach every moment with compassion for the parts of yourself that are in pain, and recognize that you deserve to feel better. I know it isn‚Äôt easy, but it IS possible.

All of that to say, there is no getting ‚Äúfixed‚Äù with PTSD. There‚Äôs progress, sure, and healing, but the trauma doesn‚Äôt go away. Your symptoms will subside and you‚Äôll learn to deal with your triggers in a way that makes them manageable. You won‚Äôt always feel like you‚Äôre in survivor mode, I promise."
