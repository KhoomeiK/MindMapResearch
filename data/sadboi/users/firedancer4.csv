ptsd,eur8jjd,t3_cemx2h,1563990907.0,"I just came across your thread, and really feel your frustrations about people misusing and making light of the PTSD terms we all use. I've had PTSD for 16 years and I've certainly experienced this as well; namely with my family after I was diagnosed in 2004. I didn't even understand what was happening to me, and I was reliving childhood abuse and assaults almost daily. I kept it to myself because I thought I was going crazy. Then I did research.. I wrote emails to my family trying to explain and share what I'd learned. But sometimes you just CAN'T get it unless you've lived it. You have to have a lot of compassion and an actual desire to **learn** about it to even come close to putting yourself in someone else's shoes with PTSD.

Your frustrations are completely warranted, but I stopped holding onto anger about people's ignorance. They just don't understand. I think of Jesus on the cross when he said, ""Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do."" I think of that a LOT actually. I think of that when I want to rip someone's head off for saying or doing the wrong thing around me, especially when I've told them I don't like it. But people legitimately don't know how they're hurting us, wounding us, or crossing the line. They don't understand PTSD, nor the severity of the pain we endure when we are triggered.

But here's a couple things to think about. ""Flashback"" was a highly used word before it belonged to PTSD. It can mean to vividly remember a past incident (not necessarily a trauma), but reliving a trauma is what it means with PTSD. (It's also used in film to indicate a scene from the past!) ""Anxiety"" has its own meaning altogether when it comes to PTSD, but most people don't think of anxiety on those different levels. Anxiety is a very loose term today for anyone who is stressed out; but honestly, we should have our **own** term for anxiety when it comes to PTSD! It's overwhelming. It's hard to contain. It's often combined with a panic attack, and it can be terrifying. But again, the general public doesn't get that. People use the word ""depressed"" synonymously with sadness. I don't think they're trying to offend. So I try not to get offended when others make light of the words that have such a deep, meaningful impact on me and my symptoms. They don't get it.

I think it's helpful just to know there is a group of people here who do get it. But I try to live out my belief that it's not worth the energy to be upset with people because of their ignorance. Sometimes it's hard, but I gotta deal with enough anxiety already living with this beast. I really try not to let others have that much power over me. This happened recently with my own brother, who I've been close to my whole life. I won't go into details because this post is already long... but he traumatized/triggered me in a restaurant, and then we argued via email for days afterwards. He called me a victim, while I was trying to explain to him what had happened to me in relation to the PTSD. He couldn't see it. Couldn't let go of his stance on the matter. I cried for days, and that event has sadly changed our entire relationship. Maybe not for him, but it did for me. I lost trust and respect, and he was one of my best friends. I really thought he understood me all these years. But he doesn't get me or PTSD at all. People will hurt us and not understand how, and their only way to justify it in their own minds is to conclude we are overly sensitive, or they think, ""poor, poor pitiful you.""

Just let it go. Focus on you and being as well as you can. Don't battle with things you can't control. Maybe I'll have another convo with my brother one day, but maybe I just need to accept this new status - though it breaks my heart. I think we all want to be understood... but maybe that can only happen among our peers. Here, in places like this. And we should just keep trying to educate others with as much patience as we can muster."
