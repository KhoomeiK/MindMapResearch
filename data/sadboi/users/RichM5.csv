medicalmarijuana,fp6vwc7,t3_gb9y5y,1588359498.0,"I know you mentioned you do not want to vape it. But honestly it's the best way to start. The cartridges have low odor and you can control it better. I have found RSO and other edible concentrates to be very hard to control when and how it hits you.  I stared mmj for Anxiety as well and it has done wonders. Same as you I liked the CBD but it just wasn't enough. If you get the 1 to 1 CBD it's a perfect mix to really take the edge off without getting wasted. What I found works for me the best is 2 big vape hits of 1 to1 after work and then 2 hits of a Indica like Bio Jesus before bed. 
Good luck hope it helps. I have not taken a Xanax in 18 months"

I would suggest vape cartridges. A sativa 1:1 for during the day. Just a hit or 2 at a time. It gives you the mood and energy you want from a sativa bit since it is balanced with CBD it doesn't let your high get over the top. I love harlequin. And a Indica for evening. Something like Headband or Bio Jesus Will give you the munchies and help you sleep good. And Leafly is a great app for researching strains. I found the area where they rate the effects to be pretty accurate.
