My only complaint with using with the insert is you need to preheat a full 60 seconds or more then heat up for the dab which can drain the battery and life of the electronics bc of so much heat. I like the Ti cup the best and the SiC cup coming up should be even better.

>What I'm finding in a lot of cases is less coil is better,  it heats up way faster and as long as it's not touching the dish I don't have problems with reclaim.

I'm finding this as well. I also can't melt in with a dab like you have to with big raised coils. I have to drop it in and slowly pool it out. I'm thinking it comes down to preference in how you vape. I like as much vapor as fast as possible. I hate waiting. The AVS Vertebraid I've been playing around with heats up nearly instantly and still wicks pretty decently given it's lower surface area.
