I still have symptoms and it's a lifelong illness but because I went there, probably prevented more damage or who knows what. It was only half a year or a year later when I got a little awareness that I realised how bad it could have gotten. I wish I had stayed longer too. There's something to be said for regular meals, having someone take care of you and proper sleep. And of course antipsychotic medication... I'm schizophrenic if you haven't guessed by my name but I didn't know it at the time was delusional out of my mind.

When the time comes to leave there, don't push it... leave when they discharge you and ask if you can stay longer. The longer you stay, the better off you will be. And follow medical advice and take medication.

But even before coronavirus I had gotten a rugged hand crank radio. If I lived in a rural area and had to deal with animals instead of a city I would have gotten weapons. For various reasons including suicide risk for people like us it's very stupid to get weapons so I wouldn't do it now.

One thing I think about is if coronavirus affects schizos. People with pre-existing conditions are dropping like flies even totally unrelated ones. The body can only handle so much and schizo is a whole body disease. Medical science has only started to understand it and the best it can do is dopamine hypothesis. Well, I'm not taking chances. Before I was working I was at home completely schizophrenic who knows what my career or life would be like. Now I am back to that state except this time I have more skills and more knowledge and don't intend to waste the chance. Looks like I will be ""checking out"" of the world for a year or two until it gets its shit together. I will not be first in line for the vaccine either... I can wait one two six months after it's out, after the crowds have died down and after the world is sure it is safe.

Ended up getting a P100 instead of a N95 but the N95 I had from a reno job (that I didn't do). I just bought a vacuum cleaner bag. It is made out of some medical grade material. I will make some homemade masks out of it.

My lifestyle hobbies history and skills all make me incredibly fortunate. I'm a programmer so I can survive working from home and my current job allows that. I am currently thinking of how I can best give back. My health and time are limited and not good, or I would be doing much more.

schizophrenia,fl65unv,t3_fmltpz,1584855442.0,"I recently cleaned my apartment. It was like hoarders. I had a hundred boxes. I thought it was normal. Maybe it was.

Sex was a really powerful incentive. I wanted to get laid. And if it wasn't for coronavirus I would be getting it every night now (now I have a gf). At a certain point. You might have to admit to yourself that you can't take care of yourself, or that your perception of reality is so skewed as to not tell what is normal or not. My stove was dirty. It didn't really bother me. I only recently cleaned it. It's probably a symptom.

I am not as badly off as you but since you're writing about it, it means you know you have a problem. Maybe try jerking off or watching porn (don't become an addict) PornHub is offering free subs to anyone in Italy. You need something truly powerful to get motivation back sex is good so is some sort of life purpose. Another way is exercise. You need to clear up enough space in your place so you can do a plank. It's fairly fast so you don't need much motivation more importantly if you can plank 2-3 minutes it means you get core strength and are fairly fit. Even 20 seconds is a lot for a fat person I am so weak a minute is hard.

Admit your primal needs and admit you won't beat it. I know I'm lazy I just work around it for example I have a software project I've been working on for years. I have been slowly adding to it and eventually it will make a lot of money (I have software development skills) but I only work on it when I feel like it for short bursts of time. But because it's the same project going on forever, I can keep adding to it and it's mine.

So yeah if you can find some motivation through some powerful base instinct you can do stuff. Without the promise of sex, I'm not sure what I would have done. Maybe you can get a Fleshlight or vibrator. Without motivation you can add up small moments of inspiration into a bigger project. In terms of mess you can throw things out one at a time. To throw one thing out, doesn't take as much motivation as ""cleaning""."

Your doctor.

So it's important to be dispassionate, not be nervous and act normal. You can always increase the dose later if you need it.

I don't want or need people to treat me differently it's none of their business unless I tell them. But in truth I need a lot of help to get through a day some from myself some from the social safety net of my country some from my family and some from strangers friends maybe coworkers. Could I do well without help? Maybe. But I wouldn't meet my potential in life. I'm not rich yet. But I very well could be. I work in technology and make a high salary. And with small tweaks in my life I could get whatever I wanted. That's specific to me though and probably only possible because my symptoms aren't as severe as others in combination with my environment people around me and my existing skillset and education.

I recommend getting your hands on ""Mad in America"" it's a few case studies on people who recovered in the USA. And they all found purpose in helping others, some in an extreme way. Nobody is an island but it seems that with schizos the more disconnected you are the worse you might get. Schizo is a complicated illness and a least part of it is environmental.

To ""contribute"" is overrated don't feel guilty if you don't. I can only do so because of an enormous amount of advantages. For example I am so heavily protected by my social safety net that my mother and brother at least have rent geared to income housing. I make so much that I don't qualify now but in my formative years could I have survived without it? Maybe not. Like many things in life to ""contribute"" is largely dependent on what's around you and what others value. It is not a character flaw if you can't.

I am basically the perfect counterexample to everyone who thinks schizos are lazy, that social safety nets should be weak, that environment doesn't matter and so on. Yes I am lazy I have embraced it you know why? Because capitalism doesn't reward work alone it rewards value. I was and am protected and that's why I am where I am today. I have the perfect storm of skills, background, help, knowledge and so on only then can I somewhat appear ""successful"". But I know what makes me a person isn't material possessions. As much as I have I know it could all disappear tomorrow. And if it did it wouldn't make me a terrible person or lower my worth as a human being. It might make me stupid if for example I gambled all my money away but I would own that.

Take advantage of every little bit you can and try to get into an environment that can help you grow. Because for us that matters, a lot. There is no reason to feel guilty because not only do social safety nets exist to protect people like us, but you only get what you invest. If society and the world wants us to contribute well they got to pay in and if they haven't for whatever reason then too fucking bad. One in one hundred people are schizo and if the protections and benefits don't help enough because everyone finger wags well we are 100% in our rights to sit and do nothing or even consume communal resources. We are human beings and deserve a minimum standard of living even if we contribute 0 the only reason we don't is there isn't enough to go around. If technology and government were structured differently we would become productive. I am living proof. As I type I am in my mom's government provided apartment with noise cancellation headphones to avoid triggers and the protection of advanced medical care in a city known for mental help. Yes, I have my own place and I make a lot of money. But could I have got there if I didn't have all that help at the start? Doubtful.

Basically I am a ""success"" today because of the help in all areas of my life. So don't be afraid to use every bit of help. In the long run it's what we need. And it's why I am here today."

You have to get diagnosed for seizures so you can get both treatment and help... Don't wait until all your financial resources are exhausted to get help get it any way you can. And don't worry about boyfriend maybe have a talk with him tell him you need his help and ask him for support he may stay he may leave but to be honest most people go through seven sexual partners before finding their life partner.

Lifestyle changes are in order.

It's like saying sound and noise has no ""fact"" therefore we should do nothing... Unacceptable in fact music therapy is harmless for the potential gain.

Even first line intervention is based on clinical observation and not always scientific method. You give someone Clozapine or Resperidone if they don't respond well you give them something else at a different dosage. I have to say I am not a fan of all the various types of antipsychotics under different brand names... To me there's clozapine and Resperidone and that's it, WHO essential medications second generation antipsychotics and not abilify with low evidence for schizo efficacy.

That combined with the DSM removing ""paranoid"" schizo as a classification type makes me wonder if political correctness is hampering understanding of the illness. For sure the stereotypical schizo person is a homeless city male and paranoid schizo does have at least one clinical presentation... Paranoid people generally retain their critical thinking skills as opposed to schizos with bizzare delusions or other types of delusions.

If you stop and think for a second you really aren't.

When I was in the hospital I saw a guy wanting to get out. He was negotiating with his mom telling his mom on the phone to stop the meds. ""What do you mean not your place to tell him"" and so on.

Now lying or hiding it could be dangerous and I'm not suggesting you do that. I'm just saying the current outcome is an entirely predictable result of your behavior.

Schizo is disordered thinking delusions hallucinations and negative symptoms

""Tough love"" won't accomplish anything in that case and actually doesn't work in real life. People rarely change direction 180 and if they do it's because of some life shock like say getting kicked out of a house. And doing that causes a lot of suffering and is far from guaranteed to work and is always a last resort. Real change happens gradually with encouragement built up over time not shock speeches or troll anger.

I view it as losing or gaining weight even if you were successful with some fad diet to change everything fast you would get it all back. That's what tough love is temporary that doesn't last good in a crisis but not much else.

Really what you are saying wouldn't make a difference. To make real gains in life you have to build over a very long period of time. One of the best advice I have had in my life is to let ideas incubate, grow, fester. I am on the verge of releasing a great piece of software actually a piece of software that can make software. It will happen this year. It certainly couldn't have happened because of tough love or any such shit. Supportive environments is what helped me.

However for reference most schizos have no idea they are schizophrenic before the psychotic break. I didn't and I had no idea for awhile. It's only years later that I started to piece it all together. I had this vague idea of schizophrenia and read a lot about it when I first came home from the hospital but awareness was a long way off. I feel aware now but have heavy symptoms. I'm not on medication but could be. My point is one of the defining characteristics of schizophrenia is you don't know there's anything wrong with you. If you know there's something wrong with you either it's post psychosis or there's a possibility it is not schizophrenia. So I wouldn't worry to death about it... It's just another health issue like the millions of others (cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, etc.) that you have to take precautions for and/or be mindful of.

Long story short I think my psychosis was delayed into early 30s by various factors mostly supportive people around me, eating a lot of fish (apparently Omega 3 prevents schizos in teenagers) and low stress (mostly). It's a shame it wasn't delayed to 40+ since I probably would be better off but the psychotic break was inevitable.

It's a good thing I have a high paying skill and live in a country with a very strong social safety net. Neither have I had usual schizo problems (drugs, obese, relationships, girlfriends). From the outside I seem like an ordinary guy. Unless you pay attention. Then you will see it. I hide it well.

It's a good thing that I and most people don't have ""bizzare"" type delusions that would leave us complete invalids. For example seeing a building walk or something. Religious type delusions happen but I'm not a religious person so I never had that. I did think I saw an alien when I was in the mental hospital but that was a very specific environment (open door sheets curtains very short nurse morning and so on). Too many X-Files or games.

Looking back I think that certain types of personalities are especially suited to survive schizophrenia. Inactive personalities or at least people who don't take action without evidence or plans. Any kind of ruminating personality, even active personalities don't do well. After all if it were actually true everyone were out to kill you it would make total sense to take action. Only a refusal to take action at all keeps you safe.

The higher you start the harder you fall... Hyper achieving males who start out with huge advantages in life (and thus higher end potential) have the highest rates of suicide in the first seven months. They see a life they think they had (or worse were owed or deserved) and feel like they lost everything. It's a narrow mindset and not supported by any evidence at all... If it were not for Clozapine you would see a lot more dead schizos. I was one of those and I am glad I stayed around. I only survived because of the unique system setup in my country actually my city to deal with mental health, my family and my specific personality.

A""life coach"" or ""self help books"" would be a waste of time for most people. Life skills is very important but probably too custom. The start would be CBT or social skills classes.

If it makes you feel better the issue is time. It takes time for the human brain to recover so you can't ""accelerate"" it. You say you wasted years. Well maybe you didn't. It's only because of those years that you are starting to be whole again.

And I wouldn't taper or go cold turkey (could cause brain damage) without medical supervision. If you say you are on meds to your psych and ask if you can slowly be weaned off by tapering or taking smaller doses they will probably be receptive if it's been two or more years. You lose nothing by asking.

So you probably didn't waste years, it took this long for your brain to recover, and so on. Their mistake was not putting you on the right meds Ablify sucks and for suicidal tendencies Clozapine is the right choice. I think because you were not correctly identified and didn't have a ""psychotic break"" so you were not put on first line drugs. Be thankful you didn't.

Schizophrenia is no joke it's a serious brain disorder and 5-20% of people either kill themselves or attempt suicide. Yes you have to do research and self-care to complete the healthcare but you don't want others doing it for you. Exercise, diet, spiritual and other types of mental health all has to be done by you.

So yes in a way psychiatry can fail you and fail others but it's almost by definition. Your psychiatrist isn't going to tell you to go on a keto diet (apparently it might be good for schizos according to some study) or increase your muscle mass. Her job is to give you a pill to snap you out of psychosis then give you more pills to keep you out of psychosis that's about it. And the right ones of course, and some emotional and mental support but they can't force you to exercise or eat right.

The alternatives could be far far worse... It hasn't been a long time since lobotomies and Freudian psychology (hahaha yeah right) and of course there's quacks and fads.

What I noticed is I have a much higher EQ than pre-psychosis. In the book ""Mad in America"" it talks about recovered people and how they always found healing through helping others. Forgiveness is the path to healing because it means your voices and delusions  become less abusive, controlling and painful as time goes.

So what you are noticing is basically human nature. It isn't unusual for people to talk about other people, even people they like, either in jest or for laughs. It doesn't mean they truly want lasting harm to the person just shared laughter at a moment of absurdity. I also saw a BBC documentary a couple years ago talking about human evolution. Basically gossip is a form of communication a way to gain advantage and we've evolved that way.

So really you are probably seeing long term malice where there is none. Basically the way a lot of people operate is to talk about other people. That's just human nature. We have a hard time accepting because we are wired differently to listen to all our internal voices that we shouldn't be... Our brains are all fucked up so we hear other voices or misinterpret other sounds as reality. So we cannot even conceive of the social world where people talk about other people. We are always 100% wrapped up in our own voices and own heads.

In the end you have to forgive others and forgive yourself. Because first what you are hearing might not be real. And even if it is. It's just human nature. And yes there are people who get a hard on (or high) messing with people's lives. Feel sorry for those people.

Besides, one day you might find you can laugh again. Someone does something stupid or acts like an idiot it's only human nature to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all or even once in a while at the person. Humor is a higher brain function, right at the top. As you rebuild social skills you will find you have a different sense of humor. That is fine.

It's only abuse and manipulation if you let it be. Yes eventually maybe someone persistent can wear you down. And shame be on that person if that's their goal. That's why doxxing or crowd stalking is such a horrible thing you can outsource the torture of one person to a mob or thousands of people, to spend a tiny bit of effort spread out among many people to create constant harassment. It could almost be respected if it was the hard work and effort of a single person say one person with a grudge looking for a fight and coming at you directly but ""outsourcing"" the actual work is a cowardly and lazy act. But in the end. Even that is a total loss for them. Because they are still wasting effort and time, on you. The amount of effort, time and energy they spent on that can never be recovered and they will regret wasting time they can never get back.

It is possible someone(s) who are total idiots and losers are trying to get laughs at your expense. But it is also possible it's a delusion. And it's possible it's simple human nature. It doesn't matter. Because in the end you're better than that, better than them. They and that is irrelevant. We have too much going on in our lives to care what a few others think. And of course you figured it all out.

Really we have places we want to be things we want to do. They can either be a productive part of it, or not.

The illness luckily hasn't affected much of my intellect. For example during my psychosis my response was to research (targeted individuals, lol) and buy electronic countermeasures.

I wouldn't be off meds if I hadn't gotten side effects and read too much literature. It was also very early on a few weeks / months after starting. It's a complete fluke. And to be honest I probably should be on meds. It's also very dangerous (can cause brain damage especially suddenly stopping if you were on it for a long time) so you shouldn't do it without medical supervision and a special tapering tool of a % every few weeks at most (pills are not meant to be split). I don't think going off medication is a realistic possibility for very many people nor is it safe. You could discuss it with your psych but most won't even entertain the thought since it's orthodoxy to be on for your whole life and you probably should. Most probably have no idea how to safely stop or taper to stop as well and wouldn't help.

If you look at recovery rates of ""third world countries"" it is much higher. The theory goes there's certain kinds of physical work and low stress work that exists there that doesn't exist here. You would basically need extremely good support and/or financial resources for five years to do it. And someone to take care of you or make the call to go back on medication if you were too psychotic which is a problem since not knowing is a symptom. So in a modern capitalist country you would need money -- money for an unusual doctor money not to work for five years money to hire someone to care for you.

Basically as schizophrenic people we cannot care what others think; even without this illness it's hard to care with it it's impossible because our brains are sending the wrong signals. It could be happening or it could be a delusion. So the only way, is not to care what others think.

You can and should always care about people in fact that's how schizophrenics recover (and how I recovered at least partly and able to hold down a job) but you can't care about who said what when to who about what. That game if you even had it before is gone. I never had it before and was a social recluse before my psychosis so it's easier for me for a social butterfly it probably seems like hell on Earth but it is what it is the signals from the brain are wrong so it's wrong to pay attention to that stuff. Besides, if you can give a little fun and joy to someone, why not? They can talk about you all they want.

After psychosis you have to rebuild social skills from scratch for me it was easier I barely had social skills to start but it doesn't matter since I've had prodromal symptoms most of my life. You are not literally burned and even if everyone hates you, you've still got your own soul. And it's quite likely they don't hate you and your perception is 100% wrong. The point is as schizophrenics you cannot trust your own senses. They could seem 100% real but basically be misleading you. You cannot act on them and you should not feel for them especially negative emotions.

Forget about figuring out who hates or likes you, you won't be able to tell anymore and it doesn't matter (if it ever did). We can't do that anymore (if we even did it) it's a losing game. Instead just be the best version of yourself and let your actions speak.

Perhaps it is easier for a man. I don't know how schizophrenic women recover. I do know that you don't need anyone else to live, make a living or love. The more whole you are and self sufficient you are the better it is for yourself and maybe eventually others.

By the way ""being with the other guy"" is dumb. He called it a ""schizo"" well that's a derogatory inaccurate term. Your original post listed only one possible symptom delusional belief of your job. That doesn't mean someone has schizophrenia that's a very specific diagnosis that includes duration and severity of symptoms. He is quite possibly a troll. Perhaps you are a troll too but doubt it. Everything else you listed from the money problems to the rental problems to everything else is ordinary. It's possible she had symptoms like delusions of grandeur or paranoia that caused her to make bad decisions to reach that state but far more likely that's just who she is. Mental illness isn't an excuse for certain behaviors or an explanation this is coming from a mentally ill person. Good luck."

schizophrenia,f92ew0e,t3_e3cfkn,1575027743.0,"I'm going to tell you something that you don't want to hear; it doesn't actually matter for you at least.

You are not qualified to diagnose more importantly you can't.

You think that if she took medication she might be a good partner for you or have a better life but the reality is schizophrenia is a lifelong disease that needs proper management and meds alone aren't going to change who she are what she is or make her any more tolerable. It might help her have less delusions or less hallucinations but that's a benefit for her, not for you. It would not fix the fundamental problems in the relationship and possibly not even help her. Because the life quality is all that matters. 1% of people hear voices and not 1% are on medication. You attribute her failing school, getting into massive debt and so on all on her supposed schizophrenia but even if she took meds the same things could have happened. There's no guarantee at all and meds are mainly a quality of life improvement not a cure. Depending how severe the illness is meds may stop her from acting irrationally but it won't stop her from being herself. Many things in life are irrational owning Bitcoin trading stocks even buying expensive clothes. Her behavior could be typical for a person with her background and upbringing.

Maybe talk to her give her some literature like a brochure. It doesn't sound like she's a rational person to start with nor can you debate or argue with her nor is she a curious person so simply giving her a hint is not going to work. Using the word schizophrenia or mental illness is not going to work unless she has education because if she doesn't her perception of all that would be from movies or pop culture.

If you want a low key way maybe watch A Beautiful Mind together or more likely give her a copy of it (the time for romantic movies seems over) then leave a brochure on her table for her to read but it doesn't sound like she would read it. So be direct as possible without using the words schizophrenia or even mental illness.

To be honest sounds like the problem is with you either you commit to taking care of her and watching her deteroriate or you walk away and stay as friends. You also aren't a medical doctor and you cannot diagnose. Her behavior while irrational to you doesn't automatically qualify as a mental illness. Failing school isn't a mental illness neither is getting in debt. The ""agent of the government"" stuff sounds terrible except you ARE an agent of the government. Maybe it's a delusion maybe it isn't. Everyone lies to themselves to get them through the day that could be one she tells herself to avoid blaming herself for the failed relationship.

Sometimes you have to walk away if you care about someone. Depending on your social skills you could tell her exactly why you are leaving... That you are afraid you are making her life worse. Then say you might be willing to give the relationship a shot if she gets help but for now it's over. Only say that if you really mean it and are willing to take care of someone like that for the rest of their life.

Meds won't change who she is.

Avoid the word schizo, she hadn't been diagnosed and you can't diagnose her. You could be wrong. And even if you are right. It's her life to live.

Good luck."

I have a fairly stereotypical presentation. Male born in a city auditory hallucinations delusions. A constellation of health problems that are typical for people with schizo (I found that out later). 

What's not typical is I somehow avoided becoming homeless and faked my way through life until my first psychosis at 33 or so. Very delayed onset. I took almost double the time to finish school I thought I was lazy or dumb but apparently I have had prodromal symptoms all my life that I only discovered after my psychosis. Through a huge combination of factors (see my post history) I have been fairly lucky to be born in a country that takes care of its mental health (the only way to be even luckier would be born in I believe a Nordic country where they have Soteria House type treatment and house visits). I am currently not on medication after side effects and don't intend to become a medical guinea pig. When I was I was more highly productive but the potential risks don't outweigh the gain. People who work with me throughout my life will just have to deal, sorry. Perhaps if I took medication I would be highly productive and useful then again it might kill my creative edge I might get unemployed and most ""laziness"" is negative symptoms that can't be treated with medication. Positive symptoms I can deal with because I have awareness most of the time. It is what it is.

Later in life I will probably start my own thing (when I'm sure it's not a delusion of grandeur and it can actually pay the bills and scale up in money).

I recommend everyone take medication. Because I doubt you fall into the very very tiny sliver of people who can do without. Like most lucky things in my life such as meeting the right people working at the right places having the right hobbies having the right skills I am also lucky with this illness in that I can work and survive without medication. The amount of luck in my life is ridiculous; a lot of help from others which I would not call luck but gives me hope for the human race. But yeah 99.99% of people are not the exception. I have literally win the lottery type of luck so others should not follow my footsteps and should always think of working with their psych and getting the right cocktail of drugs.

I strongly recommend schizos 100% control their environment as much as possible... If it's a job you don't like simply walk out. Stress is something we cannot tolerate very well obviously it's impossible to live a zero stress life (and boring as well) but there is a limit know yours. Get skills and work in a career where social skills aren't the most important issue and people put up with a little weirdness like programmer (gives you excuse to wear headphones all the time too). But in general people are good we are evolved to help each other and paranoia or belief in stigma is possibly a symptom too. 1% of the human race has symptoms or heard voices so there's schizos in all the world of jobs they're just good at hiding it.

Now is there any difference between me and someone not sick who is just ""hard to work with"" and should I be allowed to stay and the other type be fired? I don't think so. Be professional, be able to work with anyone too fucking bad that's how I see it. The fact I have an illness and an ""excuse"" is 100% a red herring and irrelevant. If/when I create my company I will take in the scum of the earth, people nobody wants to work with and give them a home. Because everyone deserves the dignity of a job and whether you like or don't like a guy beside you shouldn't have any bearing if you can work with them. If you like them great that's a bonus. However I will admit that productivity goes way up if everyone can put up with each other, so maybe it's a bad idea to force people who hate each other's guts to work with each other. We will see. As a schizo it is critical you are self aware and care about others; I am an empath so I actually naturally genuinely care about people which is a huge advantage. It is also apparently a road to recovery most recovered schizophrenics care about other people almost to a fault.

You are at an age when schizophrenics develop. Mostly boys who don't want to become men and take responsibility for their actions. Whether this is a cause or not is controversial but basically the idea of becoming a man overwhelms them. The idea of driving, paying rent, paying bills, going to work, all seems like slavery or prison of worse. So they become schizophrenic. It's not that they are faking it and not that you are faking it. It could be the brains way of adapting to an environment. Schizophrenics are far more common in cities.

But none of that matters other than as trivia. You MUST become a man, I am sorry. Your parents will be dead one day and you will be on your own.

To beat negative symptoms you have to be in a place where you have routine a schedule a job helps with that but so do a lot of hobbies.

If you can still manage to get happy sometimes, you're in good shape and can build on that (so long as it doesn't involve taking drugs)

You and your colleague need to care less. A lot less. Sorry that's the truth."

Before you sleep with them you should have ""the talk"" where you show all your cards (or if you're going around doing one night stands again no need to know). It's just like any other illness there's no reason to bring it up unless there's a reason. The exception would be if you're a danger to people then you should stay away but that's the same as if you had say, STDs you should stay away from sex then

Life is what you make it"

schizophrenia,eteb3p3,t3_ca12h2,1562727647.0,"Auditory command hallucinations are a very specific symptom and a very specific problem. To the point that there's criminals who pretend to have it and whole industries of investigators who discredit it. In short, it depends on the type of hallucinations he is having and the type of schizophrenia (why I disagree with removal of schizophrenia types from DSM).

There's a fair bit of evidence that says schizos just have a mechanism in their brain broken that can't differentiate internal thoughts from external voices. If this is true then your friend wouldn't have violent ACH voices if he didn't have those internal thoughts. Not getting into whether that makes a ""good person"" or not but schizo doesn't suddenly change who you are. If your friend is a bad person he will be a bad person after same if he was a good person... If he is angry inside or violent and is schizophrenic then he will lose touch with reality and become violent.

If you are worried about getting hurt by your friend you should take precautions the same way as if you were worried you would be hurt by someone non-schizo.

Finally one in one hundred people have hear voices / have some schizo symptoms. You read that right one in one hundred not one thousand or one million.

""What about that guy in the news who killed all his kids and wife or ate a guys heart etc etc"" if you dig into the details you will see massive warning signs / stressors. Victor Li worked two jobs, was highly religious and travelled the country for no reason other than to kill space aliens. The wife of the family killer who killed himself noticed changes in personality. Depending how much time you spent with him you would as well.

You could simply ask him to talk about it and ask him if he has awareness.

So yeah, it's about as bad as the chances of getting killed by any other person you know, unless he has certain red flags and warning signs. And lacks awareness."
