AnimalCrossing,fqjfhap,t3_gj0gn5,1589409199.0,IM DEAD. He was such a dick. I remember as a kid not understanding and typing something wrong and talking to him for like 30 minutes.
depression,fqj9mhw,t3_gj7m8w,1589406918.0,I can relate especially to feeling like I stand in my own way. I often feel guilty because I had it so easy. I can look at others who had shitty upbringings and be upset that they were somehow still doing better than me when it seemed like I had the advantage. It's kind of a shitty thought but you just have to remember that everyone is struggling in their own way. People who have it all figured out can be just as miserable as someone who has nothing. It sounds cliche but its all in what you do with it.
MacMiller,fqb000g,t3_ggobou,1589228205.0,is anyone else worried they wont received their merch or their money back ðŸ˜“
MacMiller,fqazmne,t3_gdyrzl,1589228024.0,Im honestly worried I got ripped off. Theyâ€™ve had my money for months (I ordered back in January). The whole situation is so frustrating. I tried emailing them to express my discontent and suggesting that they do something to compensate those of us who have been waiting for months but no one replied.
Music,fpst9as,t1_fpsmjkg,1588879239.0,also landon what happened to the septum!
harrypotter,fpsnsyr,t1_fpox52k,1588876604.0,I just meant he didn't consciously mean to refer to James as Harry. It just kind of happened.
Music,fpsmjkg,t3_gfbwmp,1588875996.0,Hi guys saw you at Life is Beautiful a couple years ago and it was incredible!! I'm just wondering what influenced the music on your upcoming record?
harrypotter,fpono7o,t1_fpol1d3,1588787549.0,"I wouldn't take so far as to say that Sirius was a bad guy. It was a freudian slip, he sees his best-friend in Harry and the action and excitement took him back to a time where he and James were dueling together. I see it as him acknowledging that Harry reminds him so much of James but not in a way as to replace Harry. Plus we know that Sirius genuinely cares for Harry. And maybe it is partly because of their connection through James but Sirius does love Harry as a son."
Anxiety,fpolpx5,t3_geb6jx,1588786610.0,"Unfortunately, I know the feeling well. What's most frustrating to me is the fact that you can't just relax and be yourself in public. It's especially annoying when you see others having a good time or not caring and just living in the moment."
Anxiety,fpol4h7,t3_geiyn7,1588786324.0,I feel this 100% but with really important tasks. Like things that could further my career just because I fee like I'm not able to handle it or to do a good job. It's hard to believe in myself I guess.
college,fpokiv2,t3_gel6nh,1588786036.0,it can be one of the loneliest times of your life. learn how to take care of your mental health and don't be afraid to seek help.
offmychest,fmz28q9,t1_fmxsx6t,1586503639.0,so because it has to fit into your lifestyle you don't care that these dogs could possibly have health problems? it seems selfish. if someone has an allergy that bad then maybe they shouldn't have a dog.
offmychest,fmz1nl7,t1_fmxiybx,1586503034.0,"and how is that natural, we cant just manufacture something because we like it. if you are allergic then maybe you shouldnt have a dog."

MacMiller,fm0ygu2,t1_fm0x1yd,1585668628.0,this mess was happening before the pandemic got crazy and the fact that they decide to tell us the day everything was supposed to ship that its been delayed again??? thatâ€™s really shitty
MacMiller,flz0dmu,t1_flygln4,1585612824.0,don't remember saying it did. I spent good money on something that i have yet to get. anyone would be mad
MacMiller,flyzdln,t1_flyokay,1585612222.0,yes this is what im most upset about. I know someone who ordered in february and got their stuff a week later. like there was a reason we all did the preorder
MacMiller,flybrb5,t3_frtm6h,1585599193.0,SO basically June. FUCK THIS. I wont even be able to wear my hoodie at that point because it will be too hot. Ridiculous that most of us ordered the day the merch dropped (IN JANUARY) and the dates keep getting pushed back on when we will receive our stuff. Who the hell ships merch 5 months after the drop date.
MacMiller,flyb9lm,t3_fry2rb,1585598934.0,is anyone else really pissed about this??? i ordered release day and my items are now not coming until basically June??? what the fuck
