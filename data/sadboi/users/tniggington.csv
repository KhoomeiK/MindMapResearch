ChevyTrucks,fqx0y8u,t3_gl3833,1589723134.0,The bail out killed GM... they have hands tied by EPA regulations and government tape that forces them to build shit that they KNOW will fail. Standards must be met... vehicles must be so light vehicles must meet this MPG and EPA emissions. That kind of crap is why GM vehicles are trash. Had a 16 Silverado fall apart at 62k my accountant ordered a brand new Tahoe from them it failed at 5k...both were transmissions mine was totally gone...the dealership and the local shops they outsource transmission failures to said they can’t get the rebuild kits fast enough. They are backed up with these trucks. Go to the GM authority page and look up all the problems and lawsuits with the New GM junk... I’ll never get my $$$ back but someone may be able to save themselves from “the heartbreak of America”

I am now 30 and can’t seem to have a productive relationship, I drink and smoke weed and work my ass off to just escape the reality that life just doesn’t pan out the way we want sometimes. I’m in my kitchen at 11 o’clock at night in an empty apartment. She left 20 days before our wedding. I don’t know what to say but that I am getting through what’s left of this reality until something else happens. I’m packing up and moving back in with my family I guess until I can get right. I’ve lost a lot of friends to suicide and I want to reach out right now to anyone struggling and just tell you no matter how bad life seems, your life is a gift.

Paranormal,fl3vocs,t3_fm60nf,1584799570.0,"A lot of the Marines in that brks has had a similar experience. There was a good friend of mine that was on duty one night when he heard something coming from the laundry room that sounded like a loud banging. The door was padlocked shut from the outside. Being that he was the duty, he had the key for it. When he opened the door there was a bottle of tide spinning in the center of the room. The laundry room in brks 5698 did not have any windows or other entry points beside the main hatch. He shut the door, opened it again and it was sitting on the dryers. Another Marine had a pad lock that never stopped swaying back and forward for 2 years. You could replace the lock or stop it and it would gradually sway again until it was back at full swing. It wore into the wood in the wall locker. The last one I will bring up is the shadow figure on the second deck of brks 222 on the second deck if you look to the right as you entered the stairwell Down to the last room on the right you sometimes would catch a glimpse of a dark figure moving into that room slowly. While on duty you could hear what sounded like a heavy desk with metal legs dragging on second deck but nothing would be happening upon investigation. No one lived on second deck at the time. You could also hear a single set of boots marching down the waxed halls and pivoting back again. This went on from 0200-0330. It was all in the log book that this took place. Nothing could have caused this I unplugged every vending machine and made sure it couldn’t be an electronic hum. That island is a haunted place. Very bloody conflict was going on during the battle of Okinawa and I think some people never got to leave. Also check out the haunted hotel on Okinawa that never got finished."

I locked the door and was laying on my back falling into a blissful state of unconscious, when a sound emerged from the hall. The sound of a single pair of boots squeaking on the freshly waxed floor. The boots got closer and closer. My door opened I heard the tumbler give away and the handle make the normal squeak. I figured it was my room mate back because he was an ammo driver and they would sometimes get cut before everyone else. I sat up to speak to him when I was pinned down to my rack by a black figure with red eyes that burned me when I looked at them. I couldn’t speak or move. I said an our father and I was released.

Her mother told me that a man followed her into the dining room and it startled her so bad that she dropped a plate of dinner. She described him as old and in a bloody blue uniform. He smerked at her as he slid across the bar into the dining room. Another time, the mother was in bed asleep and something burst through the door and jumped in her bed. She thought it was one of her twins, but she was divorced and they were at the fathers home. She said the bed was indented and cold.

It’s really unsettling to think about while walking to the hunting stand before dawn. That area is covered in scars in the earth that still remind us of the battle that took place. The crazy part is, the horseman was wearing armor but it was old. It looked to be from before modern times. Me and my buddy were tripping out talking about it today. The horse was bigger than any that I have ever saw. It just sat there facing the bend in the road and when we saw it I saw it in great detail. Both hands were tightly wound with the reigns of the black horse. He sat facing the west. It was 12:00 noon on a Sunday. The armor was tattered and black, looked to be iron like. It had engraving all over it but I couldn’t tell what. No cape or anything like that. Did have a sword in the sheath on the saddle. I can tell you that I 100% without a doubt believe that this thing was here between two worlds or something and we just crossed paths. I can’t explain it.

For those of us with the 8 speed and the problems that follow, we should be taken care of by GM. I say again, there is a reason there is a class action against them. There is a REASON the warranty changed from GM in that year for those trucks from 100k miles to 60k miles, and there is a reason mine failed at 62k miles and I was offered no mileage forgiveness.
