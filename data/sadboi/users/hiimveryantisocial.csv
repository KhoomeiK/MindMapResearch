I can’t tell you how to ‘get rid of anxiety’ like it has an off switch, but I can tell you how to cope: 
Whenever you start feeling stressed, listen to your favorite music- that will release dopamine in your brain and help you calm down. 
Whenever you think about your dad’s condition (I’m not sure if you live with him or not but) whenever you’re around him, ask if you can do anything for him- help your mom take care of him. Have you and your family collectively work on a project for him (writing notes, making him a card, etc) seeing him light up will definitely help you feel better. 

Try to make him happy in a bad situation, that might help too. I know it does for me with my great grandmother.

From the looks of it, yes. It sounds like that traumatic event did trigger your anxiety/OCD. Childhood trauma is often the root cause of many mental illnesses.

Best of luck!!"
Anxiety,fnjwvl7,t3_g277z9,1587008914.0,"I’m going through a similar situation as you with regards to struggling w anxiety and depression. I get them in waves, and in certain situations, and it’s honestly crippling. I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now, and I can’t tell you how many panic/anxiety attacks I’ve had in front of him, or Ho many depression episodes he’s had to sit through with me. Generally he doesn’t struggle that bad with mental illness (meaning he doesn’t have any mental disorders) so he doesn’t understand how bad I feel, he just knows that I feel bad. He knows what stresses me out and, by now, he knows how to handle things whenever I’m having an episode. 

For instance, at our homecoming I saw how many people there were and I just broke. I was ugly crying and everything. I couldn’t breathe. 
He walked me to the library (which is down the street from our school) and he just held me while I cried. He said that we’d go back whenever I was ready, and for most of the night we just walked around the town and it was really good. 

I also suck at expressing my feelings towards him because whenever I rant, I RANT. and I feel like that bothers/annoys him. (He never acts like it, I’m just jumping to conclusions) but he’s told me countless times that he’s always here to listen and that, though he doesn’t understand, he can be understanding. He’s there for me when we’re laughing in our happiest moments, and when I’m on his bed crying because I’m just so sad. 

Moral of the story, your SO (though he doesn’t understand the challenges you face) should still try to be understanding, and help you through those difficult times. Anxiety and depression are debilitating states of mind and it’s always nice to have someone be your little break from all the chaos. He’s there to be your peace, not your problem"

I don’t remember much about my mother’s pregnancy (she had been absent in my life for large gaps of time before this point, but after I turned 3 she got her act back together) 
When my sister and I were younger we weren’t close AT ALL. We fought all the time (physically and verbally) and I couldn’t stand her presence. It didn’t feel like she and I had a proper sibling bond. I know everyone fights with their sibling but what my sister and I had was pure hate. I never knew why, until I was eleven. 

My parents got in a huge fight and my dad left to our neighbors that lived behind us (he had been long-time friends with them) I don’t  remember much about the conversation, or even what their fight was about, but I remember my mother sitting outside with my sister for about an hour, and when they came back inside the house my mother came to my room and told me my sister and I had different fathers. Our dad is my biological father, but my sister’s was basically a fling my mother had when she and my father were temporarily separated. When my parents got back together my mother told my dad about the pregnancy, and he decided to raise my sister as his own. Which, she is. His name is on her birth certificate, he was there her entire life. I asked my mom what happened to her fling, and she said he was put in jail right before my mother found out she was pregnant. He’s out now, and from what I hear lives in another state with two daughters of his own. My sister has two half-sisters that she probably won’t ever know. And it’s safe to say say her bio dad completely forgot about her, since he and my mom haven’t talked since my mock informed him about the pregnancy almost fourteen years ago.
