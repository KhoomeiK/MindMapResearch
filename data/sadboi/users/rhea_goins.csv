SuicideWatch,f6x9z1g,t1_f6hj8f8,1573245401.0,I feel you. Breathing does help a lot. It‚Äôs just that sometimes you cannot even remember to breathe through all the madness and darkness even breathing feels excruciating.
SuicideWatch,f6gavur,t1_f6d96k9,1572823844.0,Yep - I hate when people say take a break. What the fuck does that even mean? Breaks are luxuries some of us can‚Äôt afford
SuicideWatch,f6gasfp,t1_f6de57h,1572823802.0,Same. Tonight fucking sucks.
SuicideWatch,f3zjnxu,t3_disq2m,1571270572.0,Yeah it‚Äôs sorta fucked up but the community is nice. Prevented me offing myself plenty of times just knowing I am not alone.
SuicideWatch,f3zjlpq,t3_divofn,1571270531.0,"I don‚Äôt have much except this - who is to say death is better? Dying is miserable and rarely happens fast - it is gruesome and there may be nothing afterwards but that isn‚Äôt the peace you long for. That peace can only be felt if you are alive to feel it. Best of luck, man, this storm will pass. (Don‚Äôt even try arguing that because we both know it will pass until the next storm and we have to ride it out to each time.)"

SuicideWatch,f3w6wlt,t3_di9vb5,1571193482.0,"All these comments exhaust me as someone else struggling badly tonight. Of course we realize there is a lot to live for - but it does not mean we want to try anymore. It‚Äôs called the ‚Äúwill to live‚Äù for a reason. Idk. All I can say is this: The moments that make me want to die feel big and overwhelming. The moments that make me want to live are small and quiet - so much so you almost miss them. I have found the most happiness in recognizing these small, sweet moments and clinging to them. Just now, my puppy walked up to me, put his frisbee in my face, then rubbed his face on my head. Most days I would tell him to be gentle (he is a big 8 month old...) and I didn‚Äôt feel like playing. But, lately, I have decided to take those moments and enjoy them. To look out the window at the sunshine, and let myself smile at it. Even if it‚Äôs just a small, half smile. Tonight, when things got really rough I literally held myself - I wrapped my arms around myself and just held on and swayed a little. I pretended it was someone that loved me, unconditionally, forever. 
These little things help a lot. The big moments of terror and pain still come - but clinging to the little ones helps me ‚Äúride out the storm.‚Äù 
Now, I‚Äôm gonna go play with my puppy."

SuicideWatch,f358v5q,t1_f34uktl,1570671329.0,If you are determined no one can stop you. I hope you reconsider as the math behind this actually working is difficult and not worth the energy. If you don‚Äôt do it right you could just end up with a worse life.... Hope you reconsider - you have a family here on Reddit that won‚Äôt ever judge you.

SuicideWatch,f358iw5,t3_dfl3hh,1570671084.0,"All the time. Not much I can say that can comfort you - just know you have a community that you can share this with and not be judged. Freezing in a forest sounds comforting - whenever I do go out (not by my own hands, I am determined to fight that) I want to be near/in nature."

SuicideWatch,f1nv2yw,t3_d9vwr3,1569627153.0,"Ya know, I feel the same quite often. I finally opened up to my mom and dad now I call them every time I am suicidal and they ‚Äútalk me off the edge.‚Äù I always thought they would freak, but they haven‚Äôt. They just talk to me and listen. I am lucky, but when my darkness is strong I find that anyone listening helps. 
Another one is self compassion - I know, at this point the idea is incomprehensible but showing myself compassion and forgiveness has helped my suicidal tendencies more than anything else. You can‚Äôt stay alive for your family, you are right, but what you can do is reach out to someone to help while you ride out the storm (that‚Äôs what I call it.) And when you are coming out of it, read up on self compassion and start showing that to yourself. You deserve it."

HistoryPorn,f0lr81s,t1_f0lmjhs,1568727458.0,"Right after emancipation? While there is a huge difference - many had no resources and nowhere to go so they worked in the fields for ‚Äúalmost nothing‚Äù wages. So, for many, because slavery robs you of any resources, it was like freedom only went so far. (Black communities still struggling can be tied all the way back to how slavery robbed them of both resources and opportunity.)"
SuicideWatch,f0kxrke,t3_d52wdj,1568691110.0,"So much of what you said I feel like you were describing me. It‚Äôs talking to others that understand my pain that really helps me through. It eases the pain of isolation. Not when I go to my loved ones that either freak out or just to tell me ‚Äúhow loved I am.‚Äù I appreciate their love, but I think love is an action not a word you say - and being expected to stay alive for others is bullshit. It‚Äôs YOU that you should stay alive for - no one else has to endure this unbearable pain. I know people mean well, but they don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs like someone has taken a blender to your brain and emotions and now everything is fucked. The only thing different than you is that I wear my heart on my sleeve, (29/F) I have tried to turn it off. Never works. Hope you‚Äôre okay. If you aren‚Äôt, I feel you though. Life can be complete shit. Buddhism helps me sometimes. Other times, I come to Reddit lol."

dating_advice,ezwwe1o,t3_d2qpjk,1568226587.0,"Life‚Äôs too short and love is too rare. So are those connections. Take the leap, ask him out. There are a million ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù when it comes to not working out...

But...

what if it DOES work out?

What if he is everything you have ever wanted and you could miss your chance by overthinking it?

What if you let him pass you by, only for him to meet someone else as you watch with regret? 

Life is short and love is rare. 

Ask him out today."
