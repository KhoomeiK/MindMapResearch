My mom was up front talking to me, but I was SO massively confused about why the hell I was there! My parents told me afterwards that I had actually “come to” in the kitchen, sat up, and they got me into a chair where the paramedics took my vitals and such. I have absolutely zero recollection of that, only waking up in the ambulance.

Epilepsy,fm0l2by,t3_fs39rc,1585660589.0,"Hi! I was diagnosed three years ago at 22 with JME while I was still dating my ex. I’ve only had one seizure, but a 24 hour EEG revealed a ton of seizure activity in my brain that was basically irrefutable proof that I have Epilepsy. Even though my ex came to the ER and sat by my bed for 12 hours the day of my first seizure, he never fully accepted my Epilepsy. I think he was scared and so he pushed it away. He didn’t want to believe that I actually do have Epilepsy and that taking prescribed medication for it was somehow unnecessary. We had been together roughly 6 years at that point, broke up a year later.

I’m pretty sure my current boyfriend knew about my Epilepsy because we were really great friends prior to dating. We’ve been together almost 2 years, and he found out when I told our friend group about my diagnosis. When we started dating, we talked about it and had a few check-ins to make sure we were on the same page. I remember walking through his neighborhood in Arlington last summer and asking him if he knew what to do if I ever have another seizure. I told him to put me on my side, time it, and to only call an ambulance if it lasts longer than five minutes. He knows that I’ll come out of it on my own and that I’ll most likely be very groggy. My favorite thing about him is that he *always* makes sure I take my medication! I have ADHD so I can be quite forgetful, and I also take meds for anxiety daily. He’ll sometimes ask me when I get into bed if I’ve taken my meds, and it just makes me feel so warm and happy that he cares so much and wants to look out for me:) Just go right ahead and tell the person you’re dating! I promise, most people only react poorly if they’re lacking in education about Epilepsy. It’s new and different and scary to them, especially when seizures in movies are so dramatized. Always be honest, good luck!"

I am also confused because earlier you said that if the woman doesn’t want the child but the man does, tough, she has to have it anyway. Then, you said a mother shouldn’t have to bear a child forced upon her. What kind of situation are you referring to there? Also, I use the pill and condoms and I have been fine thus far, so yes, I believe the pill works. I believe the pill works because I don’t get periods on the pill, that’s how it works. That’s my first-hand experiential knowledge. I’m not sure how you came to the conclusion that the pill doesn’t actually do anything. I also know that pulling out isn’t a legit method. However, just because two people use protection, that doesn’t mean that one of them wouldn’t want to keep an accidental pregnancy. I’m pro-choice and my boyfriend is pro-life, relationships are messy, not cut and dry. You seemed very inclined to assume, from your comment, that a woman who gets pregnant only got pregnant because she “didn’t make her man wear a rubber” and that’s not accurate. Why is just her responsibility? It’s just as much the man’s responsibility to use protection.

Also, as someone who has dealt personally with a loved one’s suicide attempts in the past, I am truly sorry about what happened to your sister. That’s an awful tragedy."

All of my tests came back normal until I was referred to a neurologist who did a 24 hour EEG on me, and discovered I have a high amount of electrical/seizure activity in my brain. I know it absolutely terrified my parents when it happened, and I slept for the next 12 hours in the ER. It sounds like his seizure didn’t last longer than 5 minutes which is good! Anything longer than 5 minutes is in danger territory and he would need a hospital. Make sure he follows up with a neurologist and gets the appropriate testing done. Everything will be okay! Also make sure you two have a talk and put a plan into place, should he ever have another seizure.

AmItheAsshole,fkj00i9,t1_fkisaf0,1584232715.0,"I was wondering about the traditional gender roles, too. Maybe because men are taught that showing emotions like grief is equivalent to weakness, they instead look to replace what they lost as a way to quickly fill the void and dull the feelings?"
HeartHorny,fkhwpw6,t3_ficsia,1584207398.0,"I’ve been long distance with my boyfriend for all of the almost 2 years we’ve been dating. He’s moved four times so far for work (civil engineer) and has lived in Chicago, California, Washington DC, and now Kansas, while I’ve been living in our hometown in Pennsylvania. I’ve had a flight planned to go see him coming up in two weeks, and I’m really hoping I can still go. I’m a teacher, and we’ve shut down until March 30th. He’s isolated all by himself out there while I’m here surrounded by both of our families. I’m getting to him no matter what:)
ETA: Hey, my boyfriend’s name is also Andy!"

We happened to have off yesterday already before everything officially closed, so basically I’m just waiting through the weekend to see what the next step is from our district. They’ll let us know what we’re doing about the online learning. We were supposed to have a planning day this Monday. Best of luck to you!!! Take care of yourself too:)"

I can’t get over how terrific this sub is!:) Also, this is my 2nd play through and it’s extra special to me because I never actually finished ME3. I started the series when I was still with my ex, on his xbox account. I think I got about halfway through ME3 when we broke up several years ago, and I’m finally getting around to just starting all over again from scratch. Everybody enjoy your play throughs and stay safe!!"

Teachers,fkg846d,t3_fi78ii,1584152355.0,"Pennsylvania here! Governor Wolf just closed schools until March 30th. He said that no schools will be penalized for not meeting the 180 instructional days requirement, and we may not be required to do distance learning. Still, I’m very glad I erred on the side of caution and brought tons of my materials home with me yesterday. Our spring break starts April 4th, so I’m really really hoping we’ll extend the closing an extra week to bump up to our spring break. My boyfriend lives in Kansas and I have had a flight to see him planned for several months, I’d REALLY like to still be able to see him, especially now. No judgment please, two years of long distance has been hard. 😓"

insaneparents,fkekhpr,t1_fkejutj,1584115052.0,"You fucking know exactly what I am trying to say and you are purposefully twisting words and wildly overreacting. I make it a rule of mine never to curse on social media because I don’t think it’s necessary, but you’re testing me. I *never fucking said* that poor people shouldn’t enjoy things. Not once. What I *did* say is that adults should understand how to budget their money, and they should always be prepared for all possible outcomes. I’m supposed to fly to Kansas the first week of April and again in the summer, and I am well aware that I may not be able to in April because of this. What I’m saying is that if you decide to buy concert tickets or pay for some other form of expensive entertainment, you shouldn’t be scraping the bottom of the barrel of your funds just to have enough. That means that *you cannot afford that luxury purchase* so be responsible and don’t spend that money. You should be able to look at your current funds and budget and determine if you reasonably have enough extra spending money to set aside for something expensive like a concert. Stop being an immature, sarcastic jerk."
insaneparents,fkejjg2,t1_fkedpx6,1584114496.0,"If going to a concert is a financial burden for some people, then they had absolutely no business spending money on tickets or flights in the first place. You should always be prepared and understand how to budget your money. There is always a possibility that an event could be cancelled or postponed, whether the performer is sick or there are serious weather concerns. Consumers HAVE to be realistic and be prepared for those possibilities. Spending money on concert tickets and flights to get there is downright irresponsible if you are aware that the cancellation of that event would become a “financial burden” for you."
