socialskills,fr1r4b4,t3_gm4c5n,1589824523.0,"I can wholeheartedly relate.  I had a big injury 6 years ago that put me in a coma for over a month.  I was a senior in High School and although I am naturally a quiet and introverted guy, I REALLY worked on overcoming that side of myself.  By the time my injury happened, I was a very well-known, popular, and charismatic guy at my school.  I was constantly invited to parties and what used to be the feeling of Social Anxiety I managed to turn into a challenge.

After my injury, all those feelings are lost and I'm back to my primary emotion being shyness.  What really helped me was being around my childhood friends and comfort of my hometown.  I've moved since then and it's tough to emulate those feelings in a new environment and especially after going through what I have after my injury.

I've seeped into isolation and have a pretty trash routine now.  I also want to be whole, man, it's rough."
