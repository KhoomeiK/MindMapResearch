Aquariums,f00xq05,t1_f00vkwa,1568307901.0,"No.. co2 increases the rate of  photosynthesis  which will increase the amount of nutrients and light they will use.  If they‚Äôre not getting enough nutrients (safe bet since you have algae). Or if they‚Äôre not getting enough light (a stock led strip isn‚Äôt normally strong enough for plants) then the co2 wouldnt make much difference. 

Get your fertilizers down, fix your lighting, then add co2 to notice a difference.

One required a masters, the other would hire them with a bachelors but required them to finish  their masters in 5 years of date of hire. The other one doesn‚Äôt require it but does offer a pay raise if you have it or get it. 

The thing you‚Äôre not understanding is teachers are paid for 7.5 hours a day. They actually work 10-12 hours a day. Grading papers an making lesson plains ect. Also they are required 20 hours of education that they‚Äôre not paid for. Then they have regular meetings that they‚Äôre required to stay late for that is not paid. if you really want to calculate time yes they get summers off but if you want to add up hours they still work at least 2000 hours a year which is 40 hours a week 50 weeks a year.  

I do agree with you that people go into the profession for the time off. My brother for example he absolutely hates it. He is thinking about going back to school because it‚Äôs much harder then he expected an isn‚Äôt worth the summers off. his words not mine.
