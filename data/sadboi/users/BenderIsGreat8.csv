Unfortunately the norm in nearly all of corporate America is 8-5 bare minimum, 2-3 weeks vacations, no sick days, no one to cover while you’re on vacation, no overtime pay, no weekend or holiday pay, phone connected at all times and expected to be available, pay a lot for a health plan that doesn’t cover much, I could go on.

I am just so depressed so much of the time, and when I’m not depressed I’m trying to escape or distract myself. Food, video games, tv, reading I don’t just enjoy, but use as an escape from my reality. It does not feel healthy.

Work, fees, bureaucracy, health concerns, financial concerns, and house chores take up 90+% of my free time, then i have an hour of tv and go to sleep too late.

It’s such a pitiful existence, and I’m constantly told I’m lucky I even have a job. If this is what lucky is, I just feel like such a weak fuck that can’t hack it at life."

I wish I had more answers for you. Only know that each time it happens you’ll be better at coping. Depression doesn’t make you a failure, although you will feel that way. 

I wish you luck, and hopefully knowing that you aren’t alone can offer some sliver of relief. Hang in there, the world is especially crazy right now, it’s easy to lose sight of the potential for good."

One, two, three

If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never

All the people are dancing
And they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me

But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again
If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the wine-glass out
And drink a toast to never

Oh, someday I know
Someone will look into my eyes
And say hello
You're my very special one

But if you close the door
I'd never have to see the day again"

I actually had a lot of good things happen to me and I still often fantasize about the void. There is just no way I can make it for 50+ more. I don’t want to see what the rest of life has in store for me, it will only surely get worse.

I do not know why I am like this.

Luckily I am not alone, I have a wonderful partner, but that has added a whole new level of crushing pressure. Now my mistakes are no longer my own. If I fail, I am now a burden and a disappointment. It pains me so much that I could have such a negative impact on someone I love. I feel tremendous guilt about my depression and ideation. It feels like being crushed in a vice."
RedditForGrownups,foh6el8,t3_g6thah,1587761046.0,"Hey I know you probably had your fill of advice on this, but I thought I would throw my two cents in. I am not Gen Z, but close and i have had very similar struggles to your daughter.

I am a recent adult, that I would consider fairly successful for my age. I have hit many major life milestones that society tells us are important, and  my wife and I make a decent amount of money.

Having said that, everything feels wildly unstable. In basically all of my formative years until now we have had 3 major economic downturns, terrorist attacks, several natural disasters, countless school shootings, and now a global pandemic and layoffs not seen since the great depression. 

Skyrocketing healthcare costs, housing prices, and tuition have wiped out any real wage growth, and then some. We are also the first generations expected to earn less than our parents.

It is very difficult to keep a level head when it would appear the world is crumbling around you, and you haven’t existed long enough to build your own safety net.

It sounds like your daughter may be struggling with mental health issues, probably inflamed by what I stated above. Some people will say that she’s just being a teenager, but almost failing classes, struggling with simple tasks, and not going outside are pretty indicative of depression. I know because I still struggle with it every day.

The best thing my parents have done for me, and what I attribute all of my success to, is being honest. I would be truthful with your concerns, obviously sugar coat them a bit. I would also share more about your life. How are you coping with the current situation, how prepared are you for the economic impact, are you ok? I think it is healthy to see your parents as normal humans, not infallible leaders.

Another thing people often avoid talking about, but I think is very important, is money. My parents helped me understand the true value of money, and how incredibly difficult it is to obtain even a small amount of wealth. When you view your role as a team effort and partnership with your family, that you can all band together and help each other succeed, it makes a difference. I know what I need to produce to contribute to our well being, and I know how much it will help my brother, sister, and parents quality of life. I also know that any amount counts. 

It sounds like from other comments your daughter is already receiving professional help. It is obvious you are doing your best, and you truly care. I would just challenge you to be a bit more open, share your perspective on how you handle your own life, and talk to her like an adult or equal. If you can be genuine, I’m sure you will get a positive reaction."
mentalhealth,fo3bdre,t3_g5h5me,1587483984.0,"Idk if I have much good advice. The only bit I have is to look at every day completed as a win. Everyday that goes by where you don’t off yourself or have a complete melt down, and end up safe in a bed at night is a miracle in my book.

Then think of other tiny milestones that you can hit longer than 1 day. If you have a job, every two weeks is another thing you can strive for. If you can just make it another two weeks you get paid and continue to chip away financial issues, or make rent, or whatever. 

A lot of what you see is people talking about productivity, learning things, experiencing things, etc. All of this is great if you are capable, but I’m not right now. It may sound depressing, but try to be proud for just sticking it out and continuing to live. So many people are trying to excel, I’m just trying to exist. It is so hard for me right now, so I try to be proud of every day I get through."

The worst part was losing my sense of taste and smell. I never realize how much food gives me at least a semblance of joy. 

With no taste or smell, i lost all appetite, burned everything i cooked, couldnt tell if something was spoiled, and forgot to shower and use deodorant. I did enjoy the self quarantine though, it was a good excuse to isolate myself for 4 weeks."
SuicideWatch,fo31f1p,t1_fo2lceo,1587478692.0,"God this is so fucking true. I had a big issue with depression when I was a child, hospitalized when I was in my early teens, hospitalized again at 23, and now at 27 i feel like I’m going to have another mental breakdown. It feels so pathetic.

In between some things have gotten better, and as soon as I think I’m going to be out and on to a better life, I have a pretty major set back. I cannot escape it, and I often think about ending my life. The pressure is so much more magnified when you are older, everything is dependent on your career and any mental health set back can fuck up the rest of your life and job prospects. 

And to top it all off there is no safety net or public health care, so if I lose my job to health issues, I cannot get them addressed without putting myself in crippling debt. I don’t know how I will survive."

The pressure has been turned up because of all the economic uncertainty, and this has compounded my depression and hopelessness. I barely have the will to survive in general, let alone exceed at what I feel is a very complex and strenuous job. 

It just sucks that I live in a country with zero support system. If I decide to take a bit of time to fix my mental health, I will completely fuck up my career trajectory and potentially end up on the street. I honestly don’t know what to do. It has been getting worse and worse, and I feel the walls closing in. Good luck, I know how painful that situation can be."

I feel like if I were to falter in any way, while my partner loves me for me, many people would cast doubt and shame on us. Me for not being successful enough, and my partner for not being with someone who is of equal or greater level of professional success. 

It sucks so much, and I feel like I could collapse and melt down at any moment.

SuicideWatch,fmzknse,t3_fy3c47,1586523229.0,"You’re right about the fighting for opportunity. Even before the pandemic, and with record low unemployment, the job market is insanely competitive. 

People are working later than ever and not retiring. You have all these people with 15-20 years of experience in mid-level roles. How am I supposed to compete? What they do is pay you significantly less, and say you’re lucky to be here. 

Because of this, your entire career revolves around you proving yourself in you current role, and any mistake you make is another strike to show you shouldn’t get paid the full amount. It is entirely fucked."
depression,fmb1v59,t3_fu3hur,1585915939.0,"Yeah, idk how people did it before us. Maybe it’s the access to information and that we can see what lives are possible and you realize how dismal and shit your life is. Even if you are relatively well off. 

I have lead a privileged life by almost any standard, but I dedicate the vast majority of it to shit I hate, mainly work. And this isn’t to be rich or incredibly successful. Just to lead a normal life, have an apartment, have health care, and not be in crippling debt. And even with my savings i have a relatively small safety net. 

It’s just so fucked. A single accident, loss of job, health issue, or unforeseen life event would wipe out years of saving and working. I’m in the top 10-15% of wage earners in the US and I can’t afford to take a couple of weeks to fix my mental health without fucking up my entire career.

Get up, go to work, stay at work for 9+ hours, take 45min lunch with some time outside, come home and it’s dark out because winter. Start cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, and attending to other responsibilities.

If no effort is being put in to change any of those circumstances, applying for jobs, getting a better education, starting a business, etc., that doesn’t seem like a partner. 

The online dating thing is something else though. Overall I would definitely not settle for that, that’s dangerous for your mental and financial wellbeing. Trust and respect should be the expectation, not a nice to have."

Also your previous relationships ended for a reason, and already didn’t live up to your expectations. Going back probably wouldn’t change that.

I would list out the things you feel aren’t “good enough” about your current situation. Then try to view them objectively, and maybe turn them on yourself to see if you fit your own criteria.

On top of all this I have completely lost all sense of smell and taste from COVID. One of my only real passions is cooking, and i never realized how much happiness I got from those senses before. My life is a dull grey wet newspaper, and I’m being force-fed until I expire.
