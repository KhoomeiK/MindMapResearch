I don't think mantaining friends is hard. It all should be natural. It's hard to make and mantain friends who hasn't shared the same problems for me, because I don't find myself comfortable with them.

I work as ERP analyst/consultant for an IT company. You can see the salary there in the US, but where I live it's basically 7am to 8pm - if you're good at it; I'm the opposite - on average and I get paid less than some acquaintances who are simple workers in a factory. And, because before the pandemic we used to have costumers who weren't really solid but little-medium sized factories, and the economy of my country is going to recede, I'm probably going to lose my job.

SuicideWatch,eyjcv5d,t3_cw8rx4,1567116810.0,"I was very good at football, at least that's what people said. Year after year I didn't like playing the game more and more. I wanted to stop playing it, but my father obliged me to do subscribe in the same team for another year. The following year I was a rascal; couldn't care at all if my team would lose or win. I recall one time my coach made me play something like a spare of minutes before the penalties - I used to play every minute of every game before getting bored -, as the match ended as a tie. I refused to shoot it and another teammate did and they lost. Previous years before this, I left afternoon school class in order to try out for one of the most relevant football team worldwide ( I wasn't called by any scout or I pay, but the society I used to play organized these things ) and my teacher basically laughed and said I wouldn't be anyone. I haven't even care once of being a footballer, but I got laughed at. I have played football everyday for eight years: from 2 hours to 10 per day. The only reasons I've started playing it were because I have been living close to a family who loves football; because everyone in class, at school, in summer camps or whatever used to play it... but I feel it has been only wasted time on myself. Shoot out for my teacher: I'm basically no one at the moment. He also said I was good at poetry and after 10 years I started to like poetry and literature...

Another story? My Maths teacher used to be absent for most of the year, so she made the class study the year program on our own. I obviously didn't and I did score 5.5/10 ( 6/10 for passing the class ) of the overall class. I had the possibility to recover the mark but I took the same mark. I managed to go the next class the following year beside the previous. I didn't even study much the following years but rather I was determined to take the best mark of my class in every test and so did I. Didn't gain anything cus it made me enroll in an engineering course at the university which I totally hated.

University? Hated it and beside depression hit me since day 1 and, as I already said I hated my major either, I took the BS because of social expectations or because I had a stupid aim. I've only wasted 4 years of my life. And even my body and mind as I stress so much for having a job related to it and it is the first one I found after a year of doing stupid interviews holden by bitches without any capacity of doing their jobs.

Friends? I've conquered many friends. I was the one who made a big group of people feel united and joyful. Right now I don't have them anymore. I know 0 but I think you don't have to conquer people; you just have to be yourself.

Morals? Find them; I don't have even know if there is one

todayilearned,eyelubs,t3_cwlgat,1567035598.0,"It's all about sexual selection. Once the preference for women has been tall men the game was done. Northern Europeans have a big share of population with the tall gene and Dutch are not even that many, so the taller ones had the possibility to make many more children than short ones, who probably didn't even happen to breed once. Dutch are also rich, generally happier than most of other populations, eat diary food, and cycle. Just watch the first three profiles on Tinder to see women care about height. Taller men usually have even more confidence, wealth and they say even more iq ( I guess it is only because of confidence ).

To be average looking and to be ruin by your physical aspect is whole other thing. What's all the life about if you hate what you studied, hate your looks, hate your job - and can't find a second one - and don't enjoy in doing any other activity? To have small goals without a bigger one is just surviving. And there's not point in feeling so much pain for surviving. At the end of day they can even cheer you up, but it's not living; life's a whole other thing. I want to have my mind free from these thoughts assaulting me and I can't because they were part of me years ago; now they have eaten me and I am them. I kept up with small goals without a bigger one for a while - like learning Japanese, climbing, doing online courses, and reading a lot - and I can't. The second most annoying thing is that most of us humans don't see ourselves like animals. But what really gets me and beats in my head is a quote by Rimbaud: ""The only unbearable thing is that nothing is unbearable."""
