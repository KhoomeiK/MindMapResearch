(mind you, this response came from 2 white male college students, who both came from successful families.) people like this don’t see it as a systematic problem, they see it as a personal problem. they think that if someone is poor that it’s somehow their fault and they didn’t work hard enough somewhere along the line and that’s why they’re not “successful.” i can’t decide if they are truly that ignorant or just lack plain empathy. either way it’s sickening."

Meditation,f1bkhqe,t1_f1ak73r,1569336735.0,"my meditation practice has mainly been me laying down in my bed in savasana (corpse pose) listening to a guided mindfulness meditation. theres a youtube channel that i really love called “the mindful movement” and they have this meditation that i’ve been listening to basically every day [mindfulness meditation for being present](https://youtu.be/-2zdUXve6fQ). they have a lot of other good ones on their channel as well. 

before that i was practicing yoga nidra-which i also really love. it’s a sleep based meditation in which you’re guided (via body scan and suggestions) into total relaxation and you reach a state between awake & asleep. when you’re here, totally relaxed, you meditate on your intention. some videos will give you positive affirmations to meditate on and it’s said that in this half asleep state your subconscious mind absorbs these affirmations and suggestions with ease. it’s almost like hypnosis. i learned about yoga nidra from a teacher at one of my local yoga studios. she was also a certified hypnotherapist and said that even yoga nidra is more powerful than hypnosis. very interesting stuff.

i can feel myself approaching the point where i want to turn the video off half way through and just be in my own head- which tells me i’m getting ready to take off the training wheels lol! but starting off it’s great to have guidance. my best advice is to be consistent every day. meditating is just like any other skill, you improve with consistent practice."

puppy101,eteq7my,t1_etepc4b,1562741961.0,"i can agree with you that no one should feel entitled to come pet your pup especially if you tell them no! but you’ve got to keep in mind people tend to assume your dog is friendly and they want to come interact with him. they’re not doing it to get on your nerves. they may not have a dog of their own so maybe getting to love on yours for a few seconds makes their day a little brighter. and yes although your dog is *your* pet, keep in mind he is his own being. it’s just a thought. maybe he should be able to freely decide whether he wants someone to come pet him or not. if he likes it, then i don’t see why it’s such a big deal for you to stop training for just a minute and let him get a break while socializing. if he wants to ignore them, he will do that too. 

but i guess i’ve just never experienced what you’re describing (seems a lot of people on this thread have the same issue) so i find it hard to believe that it really happens to that extent-the extent to which you’d *almost* want to put a muzzle on him lol. anytime i’ve ever asked a stranger to pet their dog they’ve gladly said “sure! yes go ahead! he/she loves it!” and vice versa- i’ve never had an issue with people wanting to say hi to my pup. so i just had a hard time relating to that. 

i have an Australian shepherd as well so i know what you mean about being bred to herd cattle. all i meant was that dogs don’t know the concept of “working”, they just do what feels right to them. they do what’s natural. herding dogs *normally* don’t just herd things for the hell of it unless they’re shown how to- which is why people train them lol. so yes by all means train your dog to do what he loves but it wouldn’t be right to force it onto him. 

but i get what you’re saying. it sounds like you really care about your dog."
