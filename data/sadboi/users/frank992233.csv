Supplements,fp3oh96,t3_gb3y2t,1588282935.0,""" The treatment for scurvy is vitamin C supplementation. Recommendations are that 1 to 2 grams of vitamin C be administered daily for the first 2 to 3 days followed by 500 mg per day for the next week. Afterward, a daily intake of 100 mg of vitamin C should be given for 1 to 3 months. Symptoms of fatigue, lethargy, pain, anorexia, and confusion improve within 24 hours of supplementation. Bruising, perifollicular hemorrhages, gingival bleeding, and weakness usually improve within 1 to 2 weeks. Corkscrew hairs regain normal appearance by 4 weeks. Complete recovery should be anticipated after approximately 3 months of regular vitamin C supplementation.[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2567249/#b7-0541403) "" ---college of family physicians of canada"
