bipolar2,eux535a,t3_chmfbw,1564083395.0,"My symptoms that send me back to the dr are either hypomanic irritability/ anger/ violence, impulsive drinking, and inability to sleep, or depression symptoms (once I get depressed, it’s hard to function). 

Why do you feel that your dr doesn’t believe you? Is it a way they act or the way they treat you? Maybe it would be worth it to find a new doc that you feel you could trust. 

As far as your family, I’m sorry you’re experiencing that. I think that for those that live with people like us who have mental illness, it can get really hard to deal with. I don’t know your situation, but they could just be tired of dealing with it day in and day out. It’s nothing about you, it’s just hard for the people who love us. If they genuinely don’t believe you, it’s not your job to convince them. Reach out to friends and find a support system that believes you and helps you. You don’t have to convince anyone you’re sick! If they don’t believe you and it’s affecting your well being, talk to a therapist about how to work through this. Your only job is to take care of yourself.

Good luck!"

MentalHealthSupport,eux1nxx,t3_chrsf5,1564082200.0,"I know this is super hard, but you need to replace those irrational thoughts with rational thoughts. Explain to yourself, logically, why these scenarios are not realistic. I can see why you would feel this way. Restaurants tend to be an industry where there’s a lot of flirting and stuff. But if you trust your girlfriend, you have to check these thoughts. Also, articulate your fears to your partner. She may be able to ease your fear and help add some logic to the situation. This needs to be done when you’re not angry/ fighting so she can understand where you’re coming from. If you share these things coming from a place of anger, it will come out all wrong. Good luck!"

bipolar2,euo1aca,t3_cgs4kb,1563936087.0,"This is really tough. I think in some cultures, there is still a strong stigma attached to mental health issues and illness. I am a teacher and frequently hear parents tell their kids this, even if they are ending up in the hospital for their panic attacks. I think the best advice here is to educate yourself. Google your symptoms and read up on what you think you have. If you are an adult, seek therapy... if you’re an adult you don’t need a parent’s consent. If you’re not, read up and arm yourself with knowledge so when you are old enough you’re ready to go. I hope this helps. Good luck on your journey!!!"

bipolar2,euha8sy,t3_cgeosw,1563823684.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. When I was diagnosed as bipolar 2, they put me on seroquel. It didn’t help with anything and on top of that, I felt like a zombie. I finally found a good doctor and she put me on a combination of Latuda and Wellbutrin. I had always been opposed to meds but this combination changed my life. I haven’t had a depressive episode in almost 3 years. The hardest depression I had was when I got anhedonia... I’d rather feel down and alone than feel nothing at all. I agree with the people on here encouraging you to find a better doctor. It can be like kissing frogs, but finding a good doctor is worth it.

Good luck on your journey. Things do get better ❤️"

Good luck to you 😁"
childfree,euh54qy,t3_cgh2dv,1563820995.0,"I actually have been there. I think the important thing here is to be sure of the reason you want kids. If you want them because you want them, then cool. If you want them because your partner wants them, I think it could cause a lot of resentment later.

I had an ex that I was with for 4 1/2 years. I thought I wanted to get married and have his babies, despite the fact that we had a pretty toxic relationship and he was an alcoholic. He wanted kids and I was in love with the idea of having a family (I didn’t have the easiest home life growing up). Eventually, things got pretty bad and we broke up. I was so grateful I never ended up having a kid with him. I realized I didn’t want them and I was idealizing something in my head. 

Now I’m with a partner who is CF. It is something we’ve discussed extensively and I’m very happy!!! I’m also very confident in my choice now.

Good luck on your journey!"
