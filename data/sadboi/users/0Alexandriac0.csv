Now I am wondering if I could instead bleach to a level 5 (or even 6 in case of a miracle?) with the correct tools and toner. However, I'm not finding any toners for anything lower than level 7 - what I've read says that I'd need to lighten further in order to tone. Is that correct? Otherwise just use a regular dye a couple shades lighter which doesn't have high lift and doesn't need bleach?"

astrology,fq9mzoz,t3_gh749s,1589202618.0,"Gemini moon in 12th. I didn't have good models of emotional regulation and acceptance. I was taught to supress everything, because I couldn't talk to an adult about what I was feeling, and if I did, it was nearly always met with brutality, dismissal, mockey, etc. This was especially true during my teenage years. It caused a lot of anguish, naturally, but as I got older and started cultivating my own life beyond my parents' roof, I really got a grasp of how incredibly important it is and how much work I had to do to make up for what I had lacked in my youth. I am still working on it :) but I'm pretty happy to have taken such big steps from not knowing ANYTHING about the turmoil I was feeling inside (and thus feeling even more anguish because I felt trapped inside myself, as well as total confusion about my identity, overphilosophising to the point of illness about what the hell I even am, falling into utter conviction that I simply cannot exist in this world), to being able to sit with my emotions, identify them, write about them, etc. and thereby get to understand myself beyond the surface. 
My moon is also square with Saturn in Pisces 9H.

What helped me most in dealing healthily with my emotions is the recognition that my emotions are just neurochemical responses to things; treat them with the patience and exploration they deserve, and kindly let them pass. Because they will pass. They're not the be-all end-all of my existence, no matter how painful and confusing.  Treat them like they're simply a part of this bizarre adventure we call life. I want to throw myself into this magical yonder instead of locking myself in my mind. I've come to understand that the best way to accept my inner self is through joyous, childlike exploration of everything else out there. (For interests' sake I'd like to add that my Fortune, North Node, Sun, Venus and Mercury are all in 5th house - so I guess it's obvious that I'd favour a particular method to come to terms with everything! 😋)

Edit: Just wanted to remind us 12H moons that the 12th house is related to healing and closure as well :)"
