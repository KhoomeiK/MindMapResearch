Our state reopened over a week ago. City and County are set to open to a limited extent Monday. 

There is a driving protest planned for today called Health before Wealth aiming to keep things closed.

Some business seem to be planning to open, but most of the mom and pop places around me have issued statements that they're still going to just do pick up and delivery.

Playgrounds are closed but City and county paks are open, with many park roads closed to vehicles.

Purchase limits remain in a lot of stores but supplies are good for the most part. Some products like whole wheat flour don't seem to be stocked any more.

I'm seeing an increase in masks in lower income areas and a decrease in higher income areas of the city.

ApartmentHacks,fqbwg2w,t3_ghxeoc,1589245268.0,"So I'm an apartment dweller and a landlord. (I live in a 4 Plex I own.) Two tenants this reminds me of....


One is a single woman who started renting with the cosigning and assistance of her parents. They wanted a key since it was their place too. Later she renewed with just her name and also had some trouble with her parents coming in. She asked me to change the locks. Not a problem. Some landlords will want you to pay for a lock change. If this happens, offer to purchase a rental kwikset set. It's often cheaper than a locksmith service and will allow the landlord to change the key themselves when you move out.

The other tenant this reminds me of is a guy who started renting with his boyfriend then broke up. He didn't want roommates and couldn't get the money together for several months. We ended up making it work by him earning a portion of his rent by cutting the grass and helping clean out shared spaces that I'd been wanting to address. He has since gotten a promotion and doesn't do any of that, but he was able to keep his independence and I was thrilled to give the work to him instead of the lawn company. 

Talk to your landlord. You might be able to work something out for payment at a later time, money withheld from your deposit, etc. If your landlord has a mortgage, that's going to influence their ability to cut you slack. A lot of the mortgage forbearance programs are essentially a set up for foreclosure. But see what the situation is. I know some property owners are getting a portion of the mortgage postponed with documentation of a tenant's unemployment. You might need to be ready to throw a lump sum at them at the end of three months, but again, talk to them. Landlords want to keep people in the building who keep the place up and pay rent. You have a partner in this!"
