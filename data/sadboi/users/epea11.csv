AskReddit,fq0y7ht,t3_gg7s0j,1589039108.0,"Trying to take shit after a week of not going to the bathroom. I had my spleen removed and I didn't try to go until I felt good enough. Huge mistake. Searing pain in my butt until I finally shit and it was so painful I tried for an hour and cried the whole time. Not a fun experience.

As well as that I have had my wrist slammed into a truck, I've also passed out twice due to stomach pain. But I still think the shit was the worst"
