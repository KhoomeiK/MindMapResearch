specialed,fg93pub,t3_evb2r5,1580633845.0,"I relate to this so much. I‚Äôm a freshman in high school. I have ADHD, extremely slow processing speed, sensory processing disorder, anxiety, OCD, PANDAS syndrome, EDS, POTS, chronic pain, Lyme Disease, depression and executive functioning disorder. I have been told that I would never have friends (by my old schools counselor), never graduate high school and that I would never be able to be normal or have a normal life and I have gone to six different schools (from bullying from kids and teachers). Just this year I switched schools to a school for kids who have ‚Äúlearning differences‚Äù that wouldn‚Äôt be able to graduate in normal school but don‚Äôt qualify for a special ed school and who have high IQs. I have a super high IQ and verbal skills but I have a lot of trouble with sensory things, organizing, executive functioning skills, paying attention, processing speed and writing. So I do my tests and some assignments orally and they move slowly, give reduced work, offer counseling and give help organizing but, they cover the same amount of information. And the kids are nice because they know what it‚Äôs like to struggle and get bullied. Anyway I finally feel like I belong and that I can graduate high school, go to college to study psychology and get a normal, well paying job. I still face a lot of difficulties and some people are mean to me or treat me differently but I have come a long way and things are better."

She also regularly blames neighbors for vandalizing her house, throwing leaves in her yard and calls 911 regularly. She also looks up if neighbors have paid their bills, has made the people who redid her sidewalks redo them 3 times because they were wrong (they were fine), chopped off part of a neighbors tree (because it was dropped a few leaves in her yard), taken down the windows in her house and replaced them with a drywall and trespassed in other peoples yards. At first I thought she was mentally Ill and needed help (my neighbor even took her shopping to try and befriend her) but really she‚Äôs a manipulative pain in the ass.
