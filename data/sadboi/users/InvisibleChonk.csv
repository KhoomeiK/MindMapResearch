3x05 - Birdbot of Ice-catraz: Billy West does the whole thing in character as Zoidberg.

3x17 - A Pharoah to Remember: Billy West does it as Fry; John DiMaggio joins him as Bender (but he slips a few times).

4x06 - Bender Should Not Be Allowed On TV: you finally see (...hear) Matt get frustrated at the network for the cancellation.


I'm not as practiced on the newer ones, but just about any commentary is good, though. John DiMaggio laughs a lot and it's infectious every time, David X Cohen always has fascinating behind-the-scenes info, Billy comes across as someone cool you could hang out with, etc.


Maurice LaMarche always does this joke for his characters, too: ""...and this is Morbo, who sounds nothing like Horrible Gelatinous Blob or Lrrr."""
selfharm,fcbey07,t3_eguecs,1577586028.0,"I cannot stand the attitude that ""if it's done for attention, it's not serious"". Even if you *had* been doing it for attention (I know you said you're not), isn't that a sign that something is going on? Needing attention is a very human thing and too many times, people underestimate that it comes from a very vulnerable place.

That said, I'm really sorry you're dealing with all this. The dysphoria, the unsupportive parent, and the SH. If you at least got support on one of them, it would be a little easier, but to have both shrugged off...! It's shitty as hell. :("

I just finished Jodi Picoult's Sing You Home this month, and she put in a full CD with songs that she'd marked throughout the sections of the book (one main character was a music therapist, hence the music theme).

Unfortunately when I listened to the songs, they weren't quite my style, but I still really appreciated the whole concept. Very cool."

IWantToLearn,fc0txh6,t3_efi2zt,1577299598.0,"I let myself read multiple books at a time this year, and it's REALLY helped boost my number of books read. If I get ADHD-y and realize I'm not enjoying the current one I'm reading, I just jump to another book. Idk why but forcing myself to stick with one at a time just wasn't working, and I didn't really notice how much until I threw that rule out the window.

Another thing (at least for me) that helped: matching books read before with new reads. I'll always read more old books overall than new ones, but if I pair them up at about a 1:1 ratio, it's easier for some reason to tackle new things."
