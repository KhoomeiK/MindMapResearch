It’ll get denied and maybe even confiscated the first try and then, like the above comment said, you’re out hundreds of dollars. 

Story time: When I was in undergrad and 18, a kid in my dorm bought a batch of 20 these puppies from an r/fakeid seller. Or some seller he found there. Anyways they looked great and were not from our state so we figured bar tenders wouldn’t know they were wonky. I decided not to go in for one because the cost was just too high for me and I was poor. First person who tried to use it at a local bar was turned away. After about two weeks every bar in town (college town) caught on and just flat out refused IDs from the state where my friend bought his batch because they had seen so many fakes from that state due to my friend. Even turning away people who had real ones. It made it into the school newspaper. Maybe some of those kids managed to get booze at a grocery store in their hometowns but no one near campus ever sold to them.

I’ll edit this to add that drinking happens and I’m not trying to tell you not to do it. It’s just safer and cheaper to find an older kid to buy your booze and wait to enjoy bars in a few more years."

I don’t have a cheap toy I can recommend, but I can say that most shops and brands have coupon codes that come and go. I have a $150 clit sucker that I got for $50 because of a coupon code.

Also I’m sorry if I wasn’t clear but I was also talking about penetration. Clit sucker while being penetrated is what gets me there. I started with clitoral orgasms, got very comfortable with them, and then continued to use the same stimulation *while* being penetrated until I could get there with penetration too. Get yourself really familiar with the stimulation she needs for a clit orgasm. Both of you get familiar. Do that with variety, trial and error, toys, porn, etc. Whatever she needs... *Then* add penetration to what is already working. And just keep at it."

Once I found one I liked I spent a ton of time using it on myself before bringing my partner in and having him use it on me. Personally, the more I cum the easier it gets. When I was 18 I had never had an orgasm. I spent plenty of time masturbating in college then met a guy I’m insanely attracted to in grad school and now it’s so easy for him to make me cum that we call it “ringing the doorbell.” 

Short answer: try a lot of toys. Plenty of masturbation. Really take your time with foreplay, introduce videos, roleplay, whatever she wants. Really encourage (without pushing) her to explore what turns her on, both with you and on her own."
