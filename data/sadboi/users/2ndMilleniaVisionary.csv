From what I have read I think you are a good person, perhaps a little troubled, but not in a bad way (ex. Sociopathic). I‚Äôd recommend you seek some form of counseling (whether with a professional, friend, your bf, or etc). In boot camp we are taught that perception equals reality. Or, in a similar phrase, you get what you give. I admire you for being able to be so upbeat all the time. I recognize your guilt and frustration towards everyone around you appearing so gullible and innocent, but try to recognize, accept and value the genuine kindness in your soul. You have real love and interest for certain individuals in your life (your bf and sister). By stating that there are too many assholes that bully and humiliate others you indicate having a positive social morality. My hope is that your ‚Äútrue‚Äù self and the persona you put on merge into one identity so that you fully experience the gratitude others have for you honestly."

Most my friends and patients I‚Äôve met share this opinion as well, but I also respect that everyone is different. These institutions generally take away your freedoms, clothing, personal belongings, etc. have shitty food, shitty beds, shitty bathrooms, and a lot of down time. A benefit that comes from these environments is group therapy, socialization in a safe environment and a lack of responsibilities. Also, group therapy presents the chance for you to learn from other people‚Äôs struggles. I‚Äôve struggled with in my enlistment with alcohol and substance abuse, depression and anxiety quite recently. Best of wishes, feel free to message me with any concerns."

Please don‚Äôt let these thoughts fester. You‚Äôll be much better off in life if you address some of these things while you‚Äôre still young. That being said, be careful who you talk to about suicide as some people with authority overreact (from personal and friends experiences).

That‚Äôs really all I have for you, other than that keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. You sound like a very nice girl and a kind soul. I hope you find some confidence and a way to stand up for yourself without getting people to hate you (ex. Fighting back and ‚Äúbeing a bitch‚Äù). Don‚Äôt let them turn you cold and don‚Äôt let them control your life. The reality you won‚Äôt see most people after highschool, and EVERYONE grows up after highschool.
