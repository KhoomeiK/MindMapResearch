And while viewing the film in a vacuum without external influence or logic is a bit silly, especially in a film which takes its historical context so seriously and refuses to spell it all out, that's fine and I'll follow that rule. 

The witch lives in a hut in a heavily wooded area, in a place removed from civilization. We know it is removed from the township as the opening scene establishes the family is leaving the town to start anew. We never see a single neighbour. We only see the witch hut, which is nestled deep in the wood and is glimpsed by only one character, who dies (edit: later, but he's certainly not himself while alive). 

But more importantly, no character hints at their knowing about a witch. Therefore they simply don't know about the witch. You're assume either that they do and don't mention it, or that they should. Both are not supported by any scene in the film. 

The witch turns from an old woman to a young one, or appears in this form. Shapeshifting. The goat shapeshifts into a man, or appears in this form. He isn't a witch but it further establishes the existence of such magic in this world. 

Okay, so not a wolf. But we know they assume it's Thomasin and not a witch because they say it was Thomasin's fault. I offered up wolves on top of this to give a plausible reason (Thomasin lost track of the baby and it was snatched away) but regardless, the film tells us they believe it was her fault with no mention of a witch until she makes a joke about it.

Thomasin also never said that a witch was to blame. None of them suspected a witch until Thomasin was accused of being one. They merely knew that a baby was stolen or lost. Probably would've chalked to up to wolves or Thomasin herself."

If it's something more character-driven --a Silence of the Lambs or Seven--then no mask is preferable. The killers are characters in their own right rather than living embodiments of mortality or punishment.

>Vetting is only of any use against people who aren't first time offenders.

Not quite. References, for example, are worthwhile in confirming that someone is a reliable employee. It's certainly possible that this was his first offense and he had great references, but I find it hard to believe that someone who would violate an NDA with Nintendo would have much on their CV. And if it's a case of him being a new, unproven hire--he shouldn't have had access to such information.

AskReddit,fg4mvug,t1_fg44e9i,1580506609.0,"> there is a clip of bill burr commenting on a nba game that made me wish comedians would do all the color commentating for sports.

See, Bill Burr can be mean, but he's very, very funny, and has spent literal decades honing his craft. There's a good balance there, and he would never just say, ""This guy sucks. He's bad."" He'd make a clever analogy or use it as a segue into a broader story or criticism. You also usually get the sense that the target had it coming, or that he's in some way punching upwards, since his criticisms usually extend to certain institutions. 

For example, he was complaining about his trip to the Apple Store recently, and made a point to talk shit about the company, not the employee who couldn't help him.

However, most commentators for e-sports are not funny and not particularly good at banter (or, for that matter, normal conversation), and so all you're usually left with is socially awkward meanness. It's just not particularly entertaining.
