I get to know them by usually starting off by asking what they do for a living. 

That question is the key to starting off a connection with a customer as I do it. 

Then as the relationship progresses- say it‚Äôs someone who actually lives near the store and visits often- I will begin to ask them how they spend their free time. How many members of their family do they live with? What are their dreams for the future?

I truly love being a barista because it puts me into a situation where I can know thousands of different ways to live. The perspective on life it offers is invaluable. Coffee is a crossroads. It brings people together and gets them going where they need to!"
