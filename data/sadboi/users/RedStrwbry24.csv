askwomenadvice,fq5hklm,t3_ggkwev,1589105690.0,"Well, that wasn't an option when I was that age, but it doesn't mean I didn't expose myself. If being nude and being sexual is demeaning, then we are doing something wrong. It's difficult to deal with, I understand that because I've sent nudes and made videos. Yet I wasn't ashamed of myself att the time and our society does not value sexuality of women, so fuck them. We should not be concerned with other people's perspectives. If we engage in sexual fun with permission of the other person, it's lawful. So, nothing is wrong or problematic. So what if I send nudes or make a video for someone I'm dating? It's a private conversation between us, if they share it, that disrespectful, but no shame on your part, yet extreme punishment should come to them. It's not a difficult to ascertain who acted inappropriately in that scenario."
politics,fq5gttb,t3_ggsfth,1589104870.0,"We've been doing it in Colorado, aka the old west, for decades - it's easy and awesome. Seriously, states have low voter turnout, lack of access, and long lines. Why are we even contemplating vote by mail??

Colorado has proven it to be a better system, high voter participation and no discrepancies in the vote count.

We have a massive rural population, as well as, a diverse ""political affiliation"" amongst our public. We have been the wild west for our entire existence and have never encountered a problem. What the hell are you annoying fucks waiting for?"

IBEW,fnyisxi,t1_fnkr7yq,1587364405.0,"Completely agree. Also, the DOL would have jurisdiction and from my experience, you have to fight for yourself. Honestly, it's not surprising to me that the IBEW is losing ground. Our contractors here have less than 12% of the work and are not interested in expanding.

Not only do they get away with disregard for people's health, but also discrimination. The hall won't interfere because they expect the individual to file and fight ; what's the point of the union then? Frustrating and pathetic. The next generation has an opportunity to change these incongruous behaviors. 

I hope this apprentice gets the help he needs or is able to take a layoff, while being assured of a position upon recovery."

ptsd,fl4114m,t1_fl3g9is,1584803408.0,"Yes, and somehow I feel grateful. It's been an immense struggle to dig deep and figure out who I am, fighting free from the gaslighting tethers and sloughing off the shame. The difficulty here is figuring out what is me and what is the abuse/trauma; like cutting out a malignant growth. Yet, it's a rewarding experience to discover oneself and feel the the shackles release. 

On the contrary, how difficult would it be to become who I am, only to experience trauma, develop PTSD, and then, try to become whole again?  To know myself and then have to mourn who I was before I could begin anew. Sounds excruciating. Seems like I would always grapple with trying to get back to that person, but the bridge is gone, only a chasm remains between the two of us. Or this is how I imagine it would be. Perhaps, it is more like remembering a simpler time, but now, moving forward without the ""innocence"" of that lifestyle?  It's all very foreign to me.

Difficult either way, right? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

My neighbor is also a night owl, and per the type, she's a bit recluse. Occasionally though, we greet each other under a quiet, star lit night. Then, just as quickly, part ways. Middle of tge night is the best ; it's as though one could feel the flora growing."

It's super hard starting a new career and taking a paycut. It's hard to work side jobs and work full-time and go to school and be middle aged. I've been depressed and house bound for three days now and I'm miserable.

I'll pull out of it, but I'm afraid of the consequences and how long it will be until it happens again under the stress.

I hope you can find something simple and fun to enjoy. I love to write and go to the botanical gardens or museums. Things I can do both alone and with others.

It's difficult being highly functional and to have CPTSD because we are driven to succeed - which translates into hiding our pain or darkness or whatever you want to call it. I also know that because we are so intelligent and driven, we will have times of maintenance and of growth.
