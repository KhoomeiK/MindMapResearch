They had more product than retailers were willing to purchase.  You may not have noticed, but milk has a shelf life.  No buyers + nowhere to send product = product dumped at great cost to the dairy farmers.  

Now, in PA I saw people lining up to buy straight from the dairy.  If they're smart, many dairy farms will resort to something similar.  Hell, we may even see the return of the milk man.  But the dumping of product proves why socialism and communism won't / can't work.   There is no free lunch and there is an intrinsic and extrinsic cost to everything.  Dairy cows and running a dairy is costly and expensive.  

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dairy-farmers-hit-hard-by-coronavirus-are-spilling-a-lot-of-milk/

Edit: Because this apparently isn't obvious, if dairy farmers give away the product, they have lost as much as if they had dumped it, maybe even worse.  Why pay for the product at all if you can get the same thing for free somewhere else?  Again, the farmers have costs.
