Myself \[27F\] and my husband \[29M\] want to go to Southern Germany and Prague for our honeymoon in May 2020. The link is to a wip itinerary from a travel agent. I had originally thought I could plan/book it all but soon realized I was in over my head. Neither of us have been overseas before so this is all new. I've never really planned a big trip like this either. The price our travel agent can get us seems pretty good, though I'm not sure how it would compare to booking everything ourselves.

It seems cheapest to fly into Frankfurt rather than Munich, which is closer to things we want to see. We are coming from Fargo, ND so flying from Fargo to Minneapolis then to Europe makes the most sense.

My husband is big into history and I want to see castles and beautiful scenery. We are more into culture, food and nature than partying and nightlife. Some places we'd like to see are Trier, Rothenberg ab der Tauber, Berchtesgaden (Eagle's Nest, Konigsee, the national park in general), Munich, Dachau, the Sedlec Ossuary and my husband is very into beer so breweries and beer halls. I'd love to see small towns with beautiful architecture. I have some experience speaking German, though I'm nowhere near fluent I can understand some and read a bit. I'll be working on it some more in between now and our honeymoon. We have a friend who teaches English in Prague so we are counting on him to show us around/provide guidance for that area.

We would like to rent a car so we can have more freedom/depend less on public transit/have to plan less with buses and trains and such.

I was originally all about staying in small, unique places like Air BnB's or something, but I'm having some problems finding places. We would like to stay one night in luxury, someplace expensive and awesome (a castle would be really cool!).

I have some specific questions but I'm also looking for general feedback or advice.

1. Would it be best to stay in Munich and make day trips to all these places? This seems like it would end up being a lot of driving. Or would it be better to stay in a different place every night, close/in our ultimate destinations?
2. Our travel agent has us taking a flight from Munich to Prague. I'm guessing this is because we can't take a car rented from Germany into the Czech Republic?
3. Originally I was looking at the Romantic Road route. Doing something along that instead seems like we could hit a lot of cool places. But we don't want to do the bus tour. Is the Romantic Road worth following? Or is going of that course better?

On a side note, I'm incredibly scared of flying and at least one of the flight legs will be most likely 8 hours or more. I'll have Ativan with for panic attacks and I'll probably take it preemptively. Any tips for this are welcome as well."
