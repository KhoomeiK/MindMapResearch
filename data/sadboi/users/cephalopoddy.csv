Anxiety,fprcdcn,t3_gez22a,1588850043.0,"Sorry you're dealing with that. I can relate. 

I've been on zoloft 50mg for about 7 months. Sex drive definitely took a dive when I started on it, wasn't interested in sex for about 2-3 months. It felt like I had barely any pleasure sensations for a while too. I was so disinterested in physical intimacy at that point. 

Since then it has improved. Sensation is normal. Sex drive isn't dead anymore, but seems to come and go a bit randomly.

I'm female so performance problems haven't really been a big factor for me. But if you're male and having difficulty in that regard it definitely sounds worthwhile discussing options with the doc. There are other meds they can try you on instead of zoloft and they might not cause the same problem, or not to the same degree."
cancer,fofbq3l,t3_g773bf,1587732119.0,"It's good news they can't see any signs of other cancer spread in your body. However, there is a remaining risk that a few stray cancer cells are circulating somewhere in your body, too small to be seen on diagnostic imaging. A single cancer cell has the potential to divide and start a whole tumour whenever it settles, such as in your lung or liver.  Various risk factors are assessed to determine if it's likely you have microscopic spread. Chemo is used to basically mop up any cancer cells that might still be circulating somewhere around the body. It's good at that because it circulates everywhere, whereas surgery is targeted at the one visible cancer site. 

Chemo is toxic to your body, and is often a difficult treatment with unpleasant side effects. But please be aware there are many different chemo drugs, and many different drugs used to manage the side effects. Everyone's experiences are different and some of the stories you've heard about chemo side effects may be very different to the drugs recommended for your particular cancer.

Chemo is shown to reduce recurrence and spread of cancers in patients who have certain risk factors. It sounds like your doctor thinks this will be a benefit to you. If you're unsure about why, or worried about the risks/benefits of chemo, please schedule a time to talk to them more about it. You should have all the information so you can make the choice that's right for you.

I can't imagine dealing with this at your age. I hope you've got some good people around you to talk through your concerns. Message me if you want, happy to chat."

cancer,fnfskd9,t3_g1gxck,1586914573.0,"They're not testing for that. Depending on your diagnosis or treatment pathway, they're testing for things like your blood cell counts (indicates if your immune system is dangerously impaired or risk of bleeding/clotting problems etc), kidney/liver function (to see if you're well enough for chemo/other drugs), tumour markers, etc.

I would hope it would be safe to disclose your cannabis use with your care providers. They're just trying to look after you and it is good for them to know all the facts. But I don't know what the culture is like surrounding that in the UK. Cannabis use is not a reason for them to stop your cancer treatment."

It sounds like a good idea for you to take him to appointments. One regular driver is better than getting different people to collect him each week in a taxi or similar. If you're able to help him at home that will be good.

However his immune function will be compromised so be mindful of that if you or your family have any ongoing exposure risk (e.g. Essential workers)"

Wellington,fms2im5,t1_fms1k3n,1586344384.0,The other article you linked says the cost nationally of running SPCA is 43mil per year. So the 4-5mil cost must be referring to Wellington specifically.
rupaulsdragrace,flxkgog,t1_flxjhh8,1585584645.0,"I love Sharon and Oddly and personally was happy with their placements. 

I would never put Aiden in the same category as either of them. Unless it's all in the editing, it feels like she's lacking confidence and has no personality other than sad shrinking violet. Also, some very low effort runways, like the ribbons n buttons one. I don't understand how she survived that.

Even her makeup seems boring to me. It's different, sure, but it's very repetitive and low key.

I don't want to join the Aiden hate train because it's the producers/judges decision that other queens went home before her. But as a fan of spooky queens, please don't lump her in with the good ones."

If liquid meals help at all you could try making more soups and purees. Tends to make things more digestible and easier to tolerate. 

Have they offered you any nutritional drinks like ensure? I don't know if that'd be any easier on your system, but worth a try if it's available to you. They're designed to help you maintain weight when you can barely eat.

Good luck finding some more tolerable foods to get you through."

insanepeoplefacebook,fevhn9f,t3_eqn6vo,1579397580.0,"I've been on snorkel trips with various non swimming tourists, they're just about always a pain in the ass and a huge liability even with life vests. Not to mention they're prone to standing on corals because they can't manage their position in the water well, damaging what's left of the reef.

That being said, I think it's pretty common for people to believe a tourist attraction is safe and open to whoever's got money. And a lot of water attractions take non swimmers and just chuck them in a vest and attach them to a guide rope. So I don't think they're insane for assuming they'd be able to join that tour."
cancer,fel8a43,t3_epp288,1579216214.0,"I'm really sorry that you have to have this treatment, it's a difficult one. Have they talked to you about diet changes and things to avoid irritation? It's hard to want to eat when your throat is raw but it's important to keep up your nutrition as well as you can manage.

Not sure what meds they use in your locale but ask about medicated throat gargle for numbing before you eat/drink. Eg xylocaine viscous or lignocaine

If they recommend regular pain relief like paracetamol/tylenol then it's something you need to keep taking every 4 hours or whatever it says on the packet. Try to stay on the dosage schedule so the pain doesn't creep up on you."
cancer,fel78ne,t3_epp4kl,1579215562.0,"Benign tumours are not classed as cancer. However, they can still be dangerous by their size or growth compressing or damaging nearby structures, which is why they sometimes need aggressive treatment.

I can understand if that experience helped remind you that you're capable of anything. Chemotherapy is a very toxic agent. Going through such radical treatment at 6 months old is pretty serious, cancer or not. Remember that when you're searching for your inner strength."
cancer,fdsh2db,t3_emythp,1578702601.0,"Wow, it was good timing for that check up appointment then. Must be a relief they've got you in for closer observation and care since things have been getting very swollen and sore. Sounds very positive that you're coping well with the chemo so far.

Its scary how fast things can change. Hopefully things quickly improve with the chemo and radiation. And it'll be great when you're able to go home again. 

Have they prescribed anything topical for the itchiness? A cool compress and some unscented moisturiser may help. You could try sleeping with soft gloves on if you have a habit of scratching yourself raw overnight.

Hope things go well."
