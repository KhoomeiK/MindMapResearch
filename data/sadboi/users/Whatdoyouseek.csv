And you probably won't know for a while. Separate healthy from normal for one thing. Just because it's normal (or normalized by society) does not mean it's healthy. Think of all the movies where they show stalking behavior as romantic.

Most likely a healthy relationship will feel boring to you. And I second what u/poisondrinker said, that if a person or relationship engenders panic when thought about, that's your cue that it's not healthy. Don't respond to her and try and block her wherever you can, so you won't have to deal with the doubt if/when it happens again."

Is she established with a neurologist? Treatment can't cure dementia but can help slow the progression, and hopefully lessen the paranoia. It's sometimes combined with antipsychotics if the paranoia is real bad. If you haven't already, and if your city is big enough, see about joining a local support group for partners of those with dementia. You'll probably be towards the younger end, but it's not unheard of at that age. Try and see if you can get set up with some respite care for her so you have a chance to decompress. Oftentimes involving family helps too, if available. A good neurologist or dementia institute will have local resources to refer you to."

Based on how eloquently you write, and the fact that you were able to contact SSA to make a fraud report, you seem more than capable managing your own finances. But if you trust your brother then I guess it's a moot point.

If she makes issues when you move out, depending on your age you might want to contact either Adult Protective Services or Child Protective Services. Financial exploitation is a common abuse tactic, in addition to the emotional/mental abuse. And frankly with prohibiting you from getting glasses it could also be considered neglect. It varies based on your jurisdiction, but you could look into it. I mean it could even veer into the criminal what she's done. Who knows maybe you could get her to pay you restitution. And they might be able to refer you to services to help with life skills if you think you it would help.

I wonder if they internally have the same cognitive dissonance. 

I dated a girl once who had actual multiple personality disorder. She had done a lot of work on herself before I met her and had fused/amalgamated all but one of her alters. The alter rarely appeared. Each was aware of the others existence, but my girlfriend's main/host personality didn't know what the alter did, she actually had amnesia for the time period. The alter knew what my girlfriend did though. Point being, because they were aware of and accepted the others existence, that relationship was way healthier and easier to deal with than my relationships with pwBPD/NPD.

I totally agree with your larger point though. I've heard the saying ""respect is earned"" from asshole bosses who treats their employees horribly.

I feel bad for my parents. They weren't abusive but sometimes could be neglectful because they were caught up in their own insecurities vis a vis being depressed. They expressed guilt wishing they would've known better or acted differently, my mom more so than my dad. Like, in the moment they argued with me and deflected blame on me when I told them I was molested by a teacher, saying I should've told them what was going on despite my being gaslit by my abuser. They were also dealing with my sister being in a DV relationship at the time too. But they've since apologized for the deflection. I used to get my ass kicked from being mugged and bullied, but this was because we lived in kind of a shitty neighborhood and it would've been cost prohibitive for them to try and move us.

It seems like a convoluted description, for my history at least Codependents just try to assuage people's anger, so that's controlling in a way I guess. But initially it's just a reactionary response to outbursts of anger, only later does it become proactive and consciously ""controlling"" because you know some of their triggers and want to stop their anger before it starts. Not that it's really possible. I wonder if the lack of codependency as a diagnosis has anything to do with it requiring another person to manifest. It's not like there could ever be a codependent who lives as a complete hermit. No communication or contact, no more codependency. So in that way it's akin to some personality disorders which can only be defined by interactions with other people or substances, or sex addiction, drug addiction."
jobs,fnbhtzo,t1_fnamcml,1586815785.0,"Americans have very strange views around work. Chalk it up to our Puritan roots, promulgation of the prosperity gospel, and rugged individualism narrative. Not having a job, even if through no fault of your own, is basically considered a character flaw. If one isn't greedy they think there's something wrong with you, and they can't imagine why someone would want to stay at a lower level job with less money even though it also means less stress. It's an assault on the collective idea that money is the best thing in life and means you're in God's favor. And don't even attempt to use getting sick as an excuse, that means you're really lazy, you somehow didn't prepare well enough, or your poor lifestyle choices must've caused it. 

Plus you're never supposed to speak ill of any past employer, regardless of the veracity of it. In my industry of social services, most folks know who the horrible employers are, including everyone in the interview room. But somehow everyone is supposed to ignore that fact. Obviously YMMV, this had just been my personal experience and from reading employment advice.

Mass societal delusion and loyalty to unrealistic narratives causes really bad cognitive dissonance. I suppose I should go to some re-education camp and made to watch Fox News 24/7 to fix my cynicism, and reinstill my faith that I too will one day be a billionaire if I just worked hard enough."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnbaaor,t1_fnb9vim,1586811981.0,Yes. That's exactly what she said. I guess I should've listened. Stupid hypersensitive me.
NarcissisticAbuse,fnay5dn,t1_fn9t3xp,1586805882.0,"OMG this happened to me too. After all the criticism, condescension, and contempt I simply told her that maybe she was right, we shouldn't continue the relationship because it seems like she had lost attraction for me. She had always said we probably should've just stayed friends and not become romantically involved, ergo I thought it was something she wanted. I also dared to add that I felt like she didn't respect me. OMG the reaction, ""How could you think such a thing? I never said I wasn't attracted to you! And I've never shown you disrespect! Honestly you're just too sensitive! I respect you enough to tell you how you should improve in life!"" Naturally she was yelling all this to me, but that's not a sign of disrespect supposedly, unless I do it back to her.

And yeah, I realize I'm also still hoping for that apology that will never come. The best I got was that she was sorry I felt things never get resolved. That was it, and you could see both the disdain and fear for her to just say that."

Also if you're stuck inside with nothing to do you could start a meditation practice. There's stuff on YouTube, various free and paid apps. Maybe your local library has digital borrowing of some meditation books. I always recommend Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction by Jon Kabat-Zinn, and the accompanying book Full Catastrophe Living. Or really any of his books. It's helpful if you want a secular version of meditation. It's an intense program of between one to two hours a day for 8 weeks. It worked wonders for me when I suffered an illness for 6 months and had nothing but time on my hands. There's also a ton of podcasts with guided mediations. A lot of the ones dealing with narcissistic abuse have mediations specific for people leaving toxic relationships. Look also for those geared towards trauma recovery. Likewise all kinds of guided yoga videos online.

If you think you have codependent tendencies check out Codependents Anonymous, coda.org. They have virtual meetings.

It's times like these when spirituality, philosophy, and literature take on new meaning. Many societies have had to deal with plague throughout time, and it helps me at least to put things in perspective.

And I highly doubt she's actually poly. So many people claim that because they want a free for all, but to do it ethically and successfully it requires a ton of open communication, empathy, object constancy, emotional stability, and self reflection that many pwBPD's have immense difficulty with."
BreakUps,fmyl3vc,t1_fmwox0l,1586488796.0,">unless the dumper was an absolute asshole,

Thank you for adding that qualifier. And I take asshole to mean people that straight up lie, cheat, or are purposefully hurtful. Like being all hot and cold, one day saying they want a relationship, changing their mind the next, and then back again, ad infinitum. Or yell at the dumpee ""I never loved you,"" or ""I must've been lying to myself when I said I loved you."" Or calling you a horrible abusive person but still wanting to remain friends and immediately trying to hook you up with their friends. That's the stuff I can't stand. There's nothing wrong if their feelings for you change, but it'd be nice to have some honesty about it. Then that honors both people's pasts."
datingoverforty,fmr8p0x,t3_fwp03s,1586316546.0,"Ask them the last time they made a mistake and what they learned from it, particularly if they regretted any actions they took during previous relationships.  I've been in some horrible relationships and am very justified in saying I was wronged by the other people. However I'd be lying my ass off if I said I never did anything shitty. If they say they never did anything bad then run because they're full of shit.

Ask them to define empathy, goodness, and evil.

Ask them how they've evolved or changed over time, and why. Ask how often they're introspective. Or the last time they were embarrassed, about anything.

With any of their answers see if they give you more than just usual tropes or platitudes. Sure it's possible they could convincingly lie with all the answers, but unless you're clinically socially inept you would probably sense when they're being insincere. They shouldn't have a readily available answer to many of these questions.

If it's too good to be true it probably is. Unfortunately there's no way to determine for sure how awful someone might turn out. But it's whether or not we feel we can handle ourselves when we face it. And by your description of how you reacted to these men, I think you're pretty mature and accomplished in that regard.

NRelationships,fmqxmlv,t3_fwv2e0,1586309281.0,"Oh damn that truly sucks. Hopefully you won't be stuck in there for much longer. I've had a few exes who threatened to kill themselves if I left them, that is such a fucked up thing to do to someone, notwithstanding that you already had experiences with this. The only immediate thing I can recommend is to call her bluff and give her the local crisis number, or even offer to call 911 if she feels that way again. Though this will probably set off a shit ton of abuse on her part. 

Are you physically safe being there with her? Might want to keep a knife by your bed or something. Maybe you can call a family member of hers, though that would also probably set her off. Hopefully you can get out of that apartment soon.

Sorry, wish I had better advice to give. When I used to get mugged as a kid/teenager, I would sort of put myself in a disassociative state and just blankly stared at my attackers. Just dead silence. It was helpful in scaring the shit out of them, because even though I studied lots of martial arts I couldn't fight off a ton of attackers at once. I think that's the only benefit I got from PTSD. Also have you done any EMDR therapy? It's really helpful for traumatic memories, such as with your grandfather."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmqby7q,t1_fmpo7a5,1586296746.0,"Thanks for the comprehensive response. And yes I agree all the arguments and points she made were just a way to avoid accountability.

NarcissisticAbuse,fmpi1xn,t1_fmpdd57,1586281211.0,">Anyway, every day I would test him in little ways. Little things.

Just curious how you tested him, as I probably need to do this myself. Although there's been times where I asked her questions to gauge her motivations, but when the hypocrisy showed up she of course blamed me for supposedly 'setting her up'. 

>I would intentionally let the lies go unaddressed and then I would bring them up when he least expected it.

I've tried this, not for lies but for her usual criticisms, and then she would complain that I didn't confront her immediately. She successfully guilt tripped me this way, because I always feel bad for not standing up for myself right away, being a people pleaser and all. Though with her I waited to respond because I knew she would blow up at me. Of course she wouldn't answer just how much time could elapse before my complaints about her behavior became 'obsolete.' Like some kind of statute of limitations or something. Even a few minutes she'd consider too long sometimes. And even if I did bring it up immediately then she'd say I was abusive and too sensitive because she never knows what she says that will upset me, despite my repeatedly telling her exactly what topics I was upset about. Sometimes she would admit that she does indeed say things without first thinking how it might affect me, but simultaneously complained that I would expect someone to think that way. Or said she was using voice texting while driving, so obviously, somehow, this meant she wouldn't have time to think about what she says."

To your main question, I often find women who won't ask questions or just give one word answers. Just why bother at that point.

abusiverelationships,fm97yoj,t3_fttf3i,1585863435.0,"Was she the one who told you that you haven't been the best husband because you worked a lot of hours? From what you write you hardly seem that way. It sounds more of just an extension of hey abuse and manipulation. She really sounds awful and immature. You sound just like how I've acted in past relationships, such as actively trying to avoid conflict. If you don't already, I would highly recommend you have cameras installed in the interior and exterior of your house. Especially if she's that close by, she sounds unstable enough that she'd do something stupid when something doesn't go her way, like one of these poly relationships falling through. Maybe put some of your valuables in a storage facility in case she tries to break in, or had someone do it for you.

Whatever you do, if she tries to contact you resist the temptation to respond at all. Inform your attorney, who should then go about contacting her if need be. Don't answer any unnecessary phone numbers. Have you and your attorney filled a response yet to the custody/support petition? Anytime you think you should help your wife out, or feel sorry for her, please don't. It'll probably go against your nature but be strong with not engaging her.

You may want to look at some domestic violence support groups. They're usually geared towards women, but see if there's any that can apply to you. Also look into attending some Codependents Anonymous groups. They're holding them virtually now because of the virus, coda.org. I don't agree with everything they preach but they say a lot of ideas things too. I would also do a bunch of reading, podcasts, YouTube about abuse.

You're not going to like this, but be aware that she may have already cheated on you. I'd recommend getting STD testing if you haven't already. Also block her, her family, and her friends from all social media. Try and keep your health up otherwise as well, exercise, good sleep, etc."
