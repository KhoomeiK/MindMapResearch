Then it was cutting out toxic people and relationships one by one and realizing that just because someone is blood related doesn't mean I have to accept the toxic behavior. It was about setting up boundaries for myself that I deserved because i'm worthy of someone's time and effort. It was focusing on my mental, physical, spiritual and emotional well being and health. It's a constant daily uptake and not just one step but rather a series of small daily steps. I'm a firm believer in self care and that looks different for each person. I have daily, weekly, and monthly/yearly self care practices that I do and it changes as I grow and change as a person. I think a huge thing, and this could go for anything not just self harm, when we stop trying to fill whatever void we have with useless junk and really address the issue and deal with it head on, however hard, we find the urges for whatever crutch we were using before isn't as strong.
