I've had violent meltdowns before, and I'm going to assume you yourself do not have autism so I'll try to describe it in the best way I can. Plain and simple: they can't usually control it. The meltdowns aren't always caused by external forces like loud sounds or bright lights or people not understanding. Alot of the time it happens entirely in they're own head. Not meaning that as ""oh they're crazy"", more like ""there's something bothering them that nobody else can see"". When it comes from an internal source it turns into ""how can you control what doesn't have a definite external source?"" Easy answer: you don't. And at times this makes us feel helpless. I'm sorry I don't exactly have the uplifting answers you were probably looking for but this is just based off years of personal experience and interacting with people on the spectrum.

I tried almost every combination of pills they could justify throwing at me. My Last major change was adding Lithium. I was actually seeing improvement on it for a few months. Then I had trouble sleeping one night and figured ""what's another couple pills of otc sleep aids gonna hurt?"". I thought because I was surviving Lithium that adding more to my plate wouldn't matter. I was wrong and it almost cost me my life. That was in May of 2019. A few days later I made a second bad choice, I did the one thing everyone tells you not to do. I stopped 5 different medications (including lithium) cold turkey. My psychiatric team basically said ""we can't stop you, but we need to monitor your health"". So I agreed to be ""voluntarily bakeracted"" at a hospital for 72 hours. After that I was allowed to go home with instructions for my family to keep a close eye on me and to return if I get worse. 4 days after the bakeract I was back to ""normal"" (if you want to call it that). A week later I got approved for medical marijuana. I've been on medical marijuana since June of 2019. And honestly it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm honestly sorry for such a long story but I'll sum it up with the answer to your question. The medication is a choice. It's not an easy choice. And sometimes that choice is made for you. But you don't have to wait for approval if you honestly want to stop. Just please don't make the same mistake I did. That goes for you or anyone reading this comment.
