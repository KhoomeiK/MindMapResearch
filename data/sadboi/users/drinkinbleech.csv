Im not sure what you mean by facing different directions,  but i really hope your piercings are centered right, because it can cause some things to look weird. It can also depend on the size of your lobes, if theyre naturally smaller and you stretch them to 00g being off center can be much less noticeable than if they’re bigger and you stretch to 00g.    
I cant tell you how many times ive heard of someone piercing their child’s ears at claires at a young age and then when the kid grows up they have to deal with off center piercings that are usually too low.   

I could go on about how much i hate claires and how much i hate piercing guns but im gonna save it.  

I wanted to become a professional piercing artist for a long time. And im one of those people that when i go into something i research the fuck out of it first, honestly youtube isnt the greatest source bc you get all these really dumb people with ears that look like a cats asshole trying to tell you whats what.  But if you can find someone who’s a professional and willing to give advice it goes a very long way.  Ive found professional piercers tend to guard their info very closely,  because a lot of the industry operates on the publics ignorance of these things.  But in general,  as long as you know a few basic things you can distinguish the good shops from the shitty shops,  for example, if they carry titanium jewellery they’re probably alright.  If they dont know what that is,  then you should run, run far away.   

Dont know if you wanted to know that or not. But like,  do with that what you will."
Stretched,fnubh1w,t3_g3uxo6,1587258503.0," Oh my,  this is going to be long,  im so sorry,  but i hope this serves as a comprehensive guide to stretching and sort of a warning and me begging you as a newcomer not to make some of the bad descions I’ve made 

I was pierced at 18 g and stretched to 14g and it ruined my ears, so try to remember what you were pierced at,  and if you cant remember just start with a 16g. 6 months between sizes is optimal,  but if you can dead stretch to the next size painlessly in a month or 2, go ahead,  you’re blessed. 

Once you start stretching your ears its important to become familiar with materials,  glass and stone are almost always safe as long as the finish is good on stone and the glass isnt chipped,  also things like the size of the wear surface shouldn’t be too small.  You can even get a fairly cheap instrument to check gauges,  you’d be surprised how much jewellery gets sold at an inaccurate size. Many things marketed as stone such as “sand stone” and “opalite” are actually just glass,  but theres nothing wrong with that because glass is usually safe. 


Natural materials like wood and bone tend to require a lot of care. You should avoid getting them wet and oil down wood every once in a while.  Even when theyre just kept in a box and left alone the wood can dry out and crack,  so its important if you buy a nice pair of wooden plugs or eyelets that they get the right care. 


Silicone and acrylic are a little iffy.  It depends on if you have sensitive skin. Silicone is really nice to sleep in especially at bigger sizes, but not every thing on the market is body safe, a trusted brand is kaos software,  but theres a lot of fakes out there. Neither material should be worn in a freshly stretched ear.  And i would suggest that you steer clear of acrylic,  even though you can find it in stretching kits,  that doesnt make it safe,  in fact,  most stretching kits with tapers should be avoided.  Lots of people try to stretch their ears with silicone eyelets,  i cannot stress this enough,  DONT DO IT.  Lots of people try to skip sizes, this is even worse than stretching with silicone,  PLEASE DONT DO IT.  Acrylic you could probably wear in a healed piercing on occasion. But dont stretch with it,  because it is a porous material and theres a possibility that it can actually fuse with your healing flesh. Polymere clay, is another thing entirely,  that shit is terrible.  Its pourous, and even worse it emits chlorine gas at body temperature,  and theres no way you can cure it to not do that. Chlorine is poisonous af and it can cause necrotic tissue. So please just avoid it. 

I haven’t covered steel yet,  as long as you confirm that its 316L you should be okay,  unless you have particularly sensitive skin,  then you should try titanium, which can be expensive,  so if all else fails use glass.  You want to be particularly careful with the finish of steel because it can vary dramaticly,  the more reflective the better. Sometimes cheaper things can be sharp. 

Its generally not a good idea to use tapers to size up past 2g.  I would strongly urge you to find a professional piercing shop and have them use their tapers when youre ready to size up when youre in between 16g to 2g. Taping,  is a good option any where past 2g you can use pvc tape or bondage tape, also using heavy plugs is good. If you want to stay at 00g youll be just fine,  just take it slow.  00g is about the size you can start using weights though,  so you might get addicted and want to move up. 


I recommend,  just like everyone else jojoba oil or vitamin E to massage your ears with daily and stretch with. It shouldn’t hurt when stretching,  maybe minor discomfort but never actual pain.

Best of luck to you stretching. It will take a long while,  its taken me 3 years to get to 0g but thats with damaged ears and my ears just don’t like to stretch as much as everyone else’s seem to."

depression,fn1o7fw,t1_fn15rwq,1586566284.0,"I’m not sure if this would help most people. But for me i managed to find relief,  i think i hit my threshold of giving a fuck and then i just stopped,  and its much easier to at the very least talk to people when you don’t care what they’re gonna think of you. Accept your human nature because theres no way you can stop it, youll just be fighting yourself. Dont hold yourself to any ideal. For me I’m going on the second year of not being a complete emotional wreck,  I’m only a partial wreck and i think its because I’m not focusing on what people think of me. I mean,  i do some social anxiety characteristic things still, but not like i used to. 
If you want to try to have friends,  you could put yourself in social situations like community college if you have the time. Even just having a teacher talk to you can help fill social needs, or being put into groups with class mates to figure out solutions to problems can help communication skills and obligate others to interact with you,  and you might even make some friends. Or if you pick up a hobby you like,  youll be able to talk to other people who are interested about that hobby in a comfortable way because youll always have a solid conversation topic to start with. 
Dont ever try to fit in,  its not healthy. And people will probably accept you more than if youre trying to. Nothing feels better than being true to yourself, and it doesnt matter who you are, fuck em. I know thats very punk, but it works for me and i wonder if it’d work for others. 
I spent years trying to be something i wasn’t,  i tried to force myself to not care for people because i knew it was bad for me,  but i couldnt stop and it hurt. And thats not the point,  care about the people who care about you,  care about the people that you want to care about,  and not because they’re guilt tripping you.   

Also,  about cynicism,  everyone does everything they do for them selves. Theres is literally nothing a person does only for another person,  they always get something out of it. People only help other people because it makes them feel better to help another person feel better. In every instance. However that is no where near a bad thing, people need to take care of themselves, and people who feel better from helping others are good people.  So its important to understand cynicism,  but in a healthy way,  because most people aren’t making selfish decisions consciously,  it just happens. 

Anyway,  i know environment can have a lot to do with it.  I was pretty alright last year for the first year in my life because i got to move away from my mother,  but i can feel myself slipping back into it because of were im at and plan to move again so maybe i can be alright, but im afraid if i move and im still sad that the problem is me and i wont be able to do anything about it.   
Its completely different now that its coming back, i get close to fainting when i get scared and i start having panic attacks for seemingly no reason, but now that ive just barely made it out, i at least want to be happy again.  Instead of it being like before and having no real idea what happiness was in the first place. 


Again,  im sorry,  im a very long winded person.  I really hope this helps but i know its definitely not the same for everyone. I dont want to sound arrogant and give off the impression that the way i got out of it is the only way to get out. I know it can feel absolutely hopeless and unchangeable at times, and I do remember people always telling me “you need to go outside and exercise and eat right and your depression might get better, you need to change your mind set to optimism”  i always felt like that was impossible for me when i was in the pit of depression. 
I never changed my mind set or my habits, thats too much to ask of someone whos depressed. I just eventually thought about these things enough to reason my already held beliefs into beliefs that could support a liveable way of thinking, because those beliefs are who I am. You dont have to be an optimist to be happy,  and no one can magically change into one.    
To be honest the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Anton La Vey,  helped me a lot.   The first two are the fathers of pessimism,  and the last is the author of the Satanic Bible. Now I’m never gonna try to go and convert someone to satanism, (im actually really closeted about it) but i will occasionally give advice from it because its very liberating,  and many people need those ideas.  But the first two are important and influential figures in philosophy,  and if you have time to skim over some of the things they’ve wrote it might help you cope quite a bit."

depression,fn0z3ky,t3_fyj4jw,1586551566.0,"I spent 3 years of school in homeschool because of the inability to make new friends and hated spending my time alone at school. The one friend i had was a grade lower than me. 
I never learned social skills, and when i returned to high school for senior year to try to salvage what i had left of teen life,  I could tell i was behind all the other kids in maturity.  The loneliest feeling to me isnt being isolated, its being surrounded by so many people who you just can’t communicate with and seeing everyone else fit when you can’t.   
I felt content in isolation,  i found myself,  which is something not everyone gets to do.  But my mom physically and mentally abused me the majority of the time i was at home. 


I think I’ve been depressed as long as i can remember.  Once i had even the slightest ability of reason as an 8 year old it started.  I got back in touch with my friend last month and she remembers all these stories about when we were growing up and shit was happening,  like my house being evicted and all this drama my dad had with his girlfriend. And  my mom neglecting her parental duties.  And i barely remember anything.  She says whenever these things happened i would get out of the area calmly and act strangely distant.  I think i blacked these things out entirely as a coping mechanism. I dont remember specifics,  i just remember it was bad.  Everything about growing up except my best friend was bad.  I honestly dont know what happened and i cant even begin to address these issues with a therapist because i dont remember them. And im apathetic about it until i remember more,  then i start getting sad again.  
I think my brain takes what little neutral or positive memories i have and tries to build my foundation out of them. But it feels like a void 


Sorry for ranting and getting off topic,  it seems like a common characteristic of depressed people in this sub.  Ultimately,  I’m attempting to relate, and i totally get what your saying. But I’m sorry for typing out so much about my childhood needlessly, its just something i have to get off my chest and theres really no where else for me to do that.


Anyway i hope you have a relatively good day and find some form of happiness or even just a form of escape from whatever you’re facing."

And if it makes you feel any better i dont have the confidence to wear this outside either, but im building it up little by little. It took quite a bit to post this in the first place."

goth,fmfsqzw,t1_fmcygn2,1586034069.0,"There’s actually a whole lot of things we have in common.   
I was only homeschooled 3 out of 12 years, and i was never classicly trained as an opera singer,  but other than that,  your story sounds pretty similar to mine.
I grew up without much money and had to shop at a thrift stores in a small town wher i lived, which meant there was pretty much nothing even slightly edgy looking anywhere.  I had bright blonde hair and people were always directing dumb blonde jokes at me.  My mom refused to let my dye it black.  And i was stuck wearing these uncomfortable clothes that i absolutely hated,  and it caused me to hate myself. 
I always kind of knew alternative fashion was there,  through the media and i had an aunt and uncle who were into harder music. But i never actually knew anyone else who dressed alternatively. 
My mom was a weird type of christian,  the type that reads the bible on a daily basis but doesn’t go to church. Also someone who is prone to believing in conspiracy theories and such. 
I had a love for metal and punk that i got from my dad before my mom got full custody of me,  and when she would catch me listening to it,  shed lecture me about how bad it was.  But it only fuelled my need to be myself. 
I basically had to “come out” three times. Once as bisexual,  which now shes twisted into thinking polygamous because i like two different genders. 
Once as an atheist,  which now she believes im going to hell. 
And once as a darkly inclined person,  although shes always known that,  i had to solidify to her that she was never going to change me.  
At 15,  i rode my bike to Walmart while she was gone and bought a box of black hair dye and had my hair black before she came home.   I only had a few black clothes,  but i threw out everything in my wardrobe that wasnt black, wine red or charcoal grey.  Later that month i discovered satanism,  and i stick and poke tattooed the leviathan cross onto my wrist.  And that was the quick part of my transition,  not really to goth,  but to something that made me feel comfortable in my own skin.  
The long part was changing my wardrobe to things i actually enjoyed wearing,  and eventually learning more and more about music until i discovered the goth genre and fell in love,  two of my highschool years were spent in my room listening to music for literally 8 hours a day. 
Anyway, i know I’m droning on and we may not be as similar as i think we are,  but im happy to hear what youve got to say."
goth,fmduu0o,t1_fmcykt7,1585978672.0,"Sorry, I didnt clarify very well,  i meant it as a “how did your parents take it when you started getting into the scene?” Kind of question.  I didnt mean to exclude anyone whos parents were goth.  Only applys to the transitioning question.  

Thank you for replying!  Spooky family is best family."
satanism,fmc8ak1,t1_fmc3ylb,1585940772.0,"Because hes a cute ass raccoon, and if someones gonna wear a shirt that says “hail satan” they probably dont give a shit about what the majority of people who dont know much about satanism think of them anyway. Its not satanists jobs to educate the public.

IMO, if you like it,  wear it. If someone else doesn’t like it, tell them to fuck off. 
Also, if youd like to eat trash,  you should definitely unapologetically eat trash."

atheism,floohsw,t1_flom5bk,1585342291.0,"Im trying to just avoid the topic all together,  but every time i talk to her she tries to convert me and starts talking about the end times and how its happening right now. I know thats what shes told to do.  But its to the point that when i state my point of view that she gets angry and calls me possessed by demons and i just dont know what to do.  
I’ve been a factor in one of my good friends losing faith by not pushing and just being a constant example of secular thinking,  but its not like that this time. 
It doesnt help that she has a long history of mental illness and when we lived alone together she was emotionally abusive and would swing at me every other day. Despite this, it always seems like she genuinely means well, some how. 


I’m always going to love the idea of having a healthy relationship with my mother, but i just dont see it happening, i think I’ll eventually have to stop talking to her and accept that shes finally happy this way, even if the way shes found happiness is driving her away from our family. It almost feels like grieving for a dead person, its been a year and a half since she joined, but some days are worse than others.  
Im going to use that link,  thank you so much. And sorry for sort of dumping my guts on this comment section."

Now shes being brainwashed and shes adopting a life with very little rights and complete dependency on her husband, who converted her. I already felt like i lost my mother as a child, now it feels like I’ll never get her back. She diligently denies any sort of reasoning to make her see what shes gotten herself into. 
Sorry if this is off topic,  im just sad."
