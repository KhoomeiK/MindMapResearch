From the Twitch streamers I have followed, there's Destiny who's a pretty big and old streamer, he built his following slowly over the years through playing stuff like WoW and minecraft and random games, and even branched out to now talking about politics all the time (this is like how a whole new audience including me learned of him), and he also do IRL streams which is like vloging.  Now that's probably way too ambitious but I think it's a good reference on the mentality of successful variety streamers, how they try different stuff and reap whatever that sticks and build upon it.  I also used to follow Amaz, who began in WoW, then got big in hearthstone, but after years of hating that game he quit hearthstone and played all sorts of smaller games.  Even though his Twitch viewership dropped post-hearthstone he successfully reached new audiences while keeping some of the old loyal fans and seems to be happy.  There's also this Dangerouslyfunny guy I know who wasn't known until his youtube Stardew Valley videos when the game just came out, and after ""milking"" it for months he now also try to branch out to other games.

So in a general sense what I think you should do is, maybe still stream your old game, but also take the option to play other games you may be interested in, with a bit of consideration into how realistic it is for you to capture an audience.  I'm guessing to begin, it would be easier if you play and make videos on games that just came out recently, where the market isn't saturated yet and fresh viewers are looking for content."

Western countries are rich from exploitation, not because we can work at 100 times efficiency and possess 100 times the resources compared to ""poor"" nations.  The reality is the exact opposite.  When the international order of exploitation is disrupted and falls apart, western countries are precisely the ones who will feel the brunt of everything first.  When shit hits the fan what we feel and say and pretend about anything no longer matters.  Things will just be what they *are*.

The poor in India, Bangladesh already live without abundant food, safe reliable water and electricity or other public goods.  They know how to survive and how to tolerate it.  The average person in the social order of an American city simply *can't live* the moment electricity and supermarkets fail.  People will be killing each other on the streets.

Countries like North Korea, Turkmenistan, Chad are already isolated by the international community.  If the world order breaks into chaos tomorrow it is literally same old for them.  The moment imports and exports aren't an option, England will instantly not be able to feed the vast majority of the population, society will instantly stop sustaining all those with bullshit jobs, and most people cannot farm a carrot to feed the family even if their life depended on it.  There will be famines in a blockaded oilless England just like there was a famine in a blockaded oiless North Korea.  People die when they have no food and things don't work, it's plain common sense physics and biology.

Go study the facts of what happens when economies of countries like Thailand, North Korea, Brazil etc. completely collapse.  Farmers in Thailand felt *nothing* different while people in the rich urban cities like Bangkok at the time were committing suicide because physical reality was rejecting their existence.

Think back to the last recession, one where America was the *centre* of impact and everybody else was just a part of the aftershock.  You would think that brought America one step closer to weakening and implosion, that an *American* economic crisis was by definition a blow to the *American* empire (as common sense as*you* getting a cold is a blow to *your* health).  Except our modern economy hasn't been a system based on pure economic reality, nor one subject to this type of physical common sense logic for a long time.

Take a look at the empire's position against the world in the last decade, as the American Wall Street crisis dealt a blow upon human society, America didn't become weaker relative to the rest of the world, America became *stronger* against every single polity on Earth except for the PRC.  What followed 2008 was *not* a story of other countries seizing their opportunity to prey on a weakened America and getting a bigger seat at the table, what happened was the exact opposite.  America preyed on everybody else to become rejuvenated in no time as everybody else grew even weaker from all the energy sucked out of them.  EU countries fell into total collapse and deep-cutting centrifugal conflict, not the US.  We had the Arab Spring, not the America Spring.  Brazil collapsed back into an environment killing resource exporting economy, America didn't.  India monetary policies became the mother of eternal chaos, meanwhile the people clung even tighter on the dollar.

Fake and false ""healthy"" commercial food choices flood most of the market, doesn't imply all foods affect your health equally and you can't eat healthily or unhealthily.  Politicians overblow, distort, and lie about every issue ever (whether it's screaming about everyone dying from climate change in 5 years on the left or everyone dying from Mexican invasion in 5 years on the right) to get votes, doesn't imply climate change is a hoax or everything will be fine if we had opened borders with Mexico."

depression,eve03uj,t1_evdj7it,1564451924.0,"Sounds cliche but I was made to realise me having the emotion of love as a gay person is not evil, that it will not lead me to doom (aids, being butchered, faking a loveless marriage for life etc.).  It's hard to explain without writing a whole essay about my life, but I had a host of problems and my sexuality wasn't too much of a concern I thought, because I accepted defeat on that long ago.  I thought I was more bothered by how I didn't see value in money, in social status, in society etc. and thus I had zero directions or goals in life, extremely unmotivated to be ""successful"" or socialise or anything.  Or that maybe I can't move beyond my childhood trauma with a narcissist, couldn't take how horrible human suffering in general and all the apathy and stuff.


Then one day I was made to realise that me having the ability to love is not actually evil.  After that everything else solved themselves, and I didn't even know that would happen and this is what caused me to be in deep despair and saw zero meaning and future in everything all the time.


Like I still don't worship money, still not interested in consumerism, still think corporate ""success"" is idiotic.  But now that love is a good thing, something possible, something I can want and reach for, having $$$ in the bank actually means something you know?  So is working out, grooming myself, looking presentable, socialising, there's now a place to reach with all these steps taken.  This is what years of ""fake it till you make it"" could never give me.  Fake your life and you just make a fake life.  To solve something real holding you down you need to lift it off for real.

Which is why I now believe people are probably just held down by one fundamental source and everything else, while they are a part of the horribleness and contributing to depression, is just part of the downward spiral.  Once the centre of gravity of the downward spiral is eliminated, everything else can rise too."
depression,evd4xqg,t1_evcg5br,1564430209.0,"What gives you hope?  It is different for everybody.


Imagine the world just as shitty and full of hardships as ever.  Having *what* is going to help push you through life regardless?  Money?  Fame?  Love?  Knowledge?


Like literally imagine if you now get to choose your future.  A box of bad is coming your way (like a lack of money, a lack of love, lack of social hierarchy success or whatever), but in exchange you get granted one wish to have ONE thing perfect the way you like it, forever.  Something you can immediately look at after any of the above and immediately be full of hope and shrug off all the bad noise.  What is it?


For example, is it money?  Boss is an ass, but then you go home and find yourself still with a big bank account and consumption power so you immediately feels satisfied with life?  Relationship doesn't work out, but you are still rich, so whatever?

Is it love?  Work sucks, but you are home to a perfectly loving wife/husband so life is still good?  You are relatively poor but you will have mutual love and a great time living together with whatever you have so life is still good?


Is it friends?  As long as you have true bros/sis and it continues forever, then it literally isn't that bad if your house burned down and it ended up deepened your friendship?


Everybody like to have everything good, duh, but different people will have different TRUE wishes that will bring them all the hope they need.  If you take 100 people, somebody literally wouldn't mind a few rocky relationships and unhonest work if it meant they will possess money (whatever materialism, power etc. associated with wealth).  Somebody else would be miserable with money and never true love, and would choose love even if it is a satisfying love life without much materialism and social recognition.  Some people would literally choose to neglect their decent material QoL and a good partner but then they go crazy about moving up the social hierarchy and gaining power over others or having fame in public or whatever and only finds immense satisfaction in that...

We all have different hopes, if you don't be clear what is your hope and what is the true place you want to end up, then you will of course wander lost and don't have direction."

depression,euwxib3,t1_euwvlkp,1564080761.0,"The way I might do it might be just honestly and quickly explain the situation (like you did here, you got depressive episodes, last semester you want to do well) and give them the heads up.  Then take initiative to ask if they would like to see a doctor's note or something, and if there's anything you can prepare/do ahead of time to help yourself do the best in their course and take everything as normal as possible.

Let's be honest, we can't just demand&expect profs to treat us with any privilege even if we genuinely need the accommodations.    However we can show our willingness to work and our genuine need, and our respect for their perspective, and most profs should be good human beings and understand your issue."

Just the simple act of allowing people to work from home makes life so much better but of course we must do everything we can to stop it from happening.

Who's even to say that you are being productive?  What's even a good time?  What's even the point in all this?  Is it productiveness to pour your soul and life into work for 40 years and get some random shit you might end up not wanting in return?  Is it productiveness when you climb up the career ladder and end up with a shit partner/failed parenting?  Was it your life productive when you life is miracleX100 and everything is ""perfect"" and poof 10 years after you die absolutely not one single soul on Earth even know you ever existed just like you yourself right now cannot know about the billions of souls that perished even if you made it your life mission to know?

A hamster runs tirelessly on a wheel, apparently *believing* itself to be somehow doing something, is it being productive?  How do we know we aren't that hamster?
