Not wanting my leg to get crushed, I automatically reached out to try to push away from the fence instead of just slowing the horse down or using the reins to guide the horse away from the fence because I was an idiot. I guess I instinctively grabbed on to the rail instead of just pushing off of it with my hand and because the horse continued running, my arm got yanked out of socket. Luckily my riding instructor was able to just pop it back into place but it hurt like a bitch."
