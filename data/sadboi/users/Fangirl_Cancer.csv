So I recently watched a mandela effect video about a pokemon named Tentaquil that doesn't actually exist. ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pnOwaTUhQA&t=146s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pnOwaTUhQA&t=146s) )

The video explained that the only person who remembered the pokemon was the one who drew it from memory on 4-chan. But the thing is, I'm pretty certain I remember it.

The thing is though, the only pokemon game I've played is the diamond version, which doesn't have Tentaquil in it, even in the universe that it comes from. I remember it though, because I remember seeing it somewhere else on the internet where it was mentioned in passing. The first time I heard about the related mandela effect was when I watched the video a couple of days ago, which leads me to believe I am from the universe where Tentaquil exists.

It is possible that I'm just misremembering, but I wanted to share because I also want to know if anyone else remembers Tentaquil.

If you remember this pokemon, please let me know. Again, the video said that the only person who remembered it was the 4-chan user, but I have my doubts that they and I are the only ones."
