Anxiety,fn6qpln,t3_fzxnzr,1586705430.0,"You have to retrain your brain, which is not an easy task. It may be easier to do with a professional therapist or social worker, someone with training in things like mindfulness and intrusive thoughts (look both of these up for more info on things you're likely dealing with).   


I deal with these exact feelings, and I can tell you that the first step is convincing yourself of a fundamental truth that applies to **EVERYONE**: we all need down-time. We all need ""me time"", a chance to decompress, relax, let go of our everyday stresses as best we can and just enjoy something, anything. This is really an undeniable truth because without this, our overall mental health will simply get worse, or to the point you're at where enjoying any part of your day is seemingly impossible.   


It really does boil down to adjusting your thinking, even when you don't *feel* the thoughts, if that makes sense. Like, if you think of the happiest memory of your life, it usually gives you some of those feelings, yeah? Well, when it comes to this, you might not feel the associated feelings you'd typically get by saying ""I deserve a reprieve, I'm going to do something I like doing"". That could be a form of depression or, in my experience, intrusive thoughts that do their best to prevent you from a variety of behaviors and emotions if you're not careful and let yourself dwell on them.   


You have to face up to the feelings you're struggling with and fight them head-on, and I can tell you from experience, it's helpful to have people in your corner. Professionals who know about and/or have dealt with such things are great for this, they can help you get outside of your thinking long enough to see it from a different perspective. But hopefully you can do this on your own as well. Research mindfulness, and check into the concept of intrusive thoughts and how they can negatively effect your life. You might pick something up that helps in the fight against them. Hope some of this helps. It *does* work, fighting against it, and it takes time and consistent effort, but sometimes you'll be surprised at how quickly your thinking can change if you work at it."

And it's bizarre, sometimes the thought will be simply ""why don't you do something NEW instead? replaying/rewatching things is literally a waste of time!"".   


It's like, to hell with you, intrusive thoughts, I'm comforted by repetition and I explore new things when new things look appealing. Easier said than done, but knowing my well-being depends on having an adequate amount of down time to spend *how I prefer* is far more important than just staring into space or forcing myself to do another chore or task that doesn't need to be done at that moment.

TrueFilm,f8os17g,t1_f8oob84,1574689070.0,"For sure. I never much considered envy in the overall analysis of Daniel's character or the film, but I'm at a loss as to what else you could call it. He definitely wants to have more, and I think the argument that it's because he wants others to have less is accurate in context to Daniel's words and actions. I think it's somewhat more accurate than chalking it up to pure greed, as you said it being impersonal makes it more likely that the greed is just a means to an end. If you're envious of others, you're naturally going to adopt traits of greed if you choose to let envy motivate you in your actions.

This puts me in mind to Yoda's explanation of the path to the dark side, where for force-sensitives it would be fear to anger to hate to suffering. For Daniel, I think it's mistrust - self-preservation - envy/jealousy - greed - suffering. The man was ultimately never satisfied, could never feel safe or at peace or content. It's really a tragic story, something I don't think is easily picked up and takes multiple viewings to appreciate. Something was broken in Daniel and we never really get to pinpoint what, and how it may have broken."

I've noticed this stuff too, far more with depression than anxiety-based merchandise, but either way there is the undeniable fact that it, intentionally or not, trivializes or can trivialize serious conditions. Disregarding the more important aspect of societies in general treating serious mental conditions with less concern because of false clinical diagnoses and immature/ignorant self-diagnoses, selling something like [this](https://www.redbubble.com/people/xdeluxe/works/35008247-anxiety-amazon-logo?body_color=white&p=t-shirt&print_location=front&size=medium&style=mens&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=g.pla+notset&country_code=US&gclid=CjwKCAiAlO7uBRANEiwA_vXQ-__Kfz9ZRtgvilggYncIt2CV3J1EsYQS5josLCbGUkt6P8xEyMLJJxoCroMQAvD_BwE) isn't helping either. You'll notice that these more ""quirky/trendy"" items are sold alongside things that *seem* more positive, like shirts with motivating quotes or the like. But taken as a whole, no, you don't help anyone by trying to make mental disorders appear trendy (again, whether intended or not). And you definitely don't help it by putting money in your pocket in the process. From the outside looking in, it likely makes those not necessarily suffering from these types of conditions feel as if they *could be* or that they might somehow be cool/hip to self-diagnose general everyday sadness or stress as mental conditions and then buy a shirt like their anxiety disorder is a new band everyone is into.   


That shit is beyond shameful.   


But my original point, the argument you made, I just want to touch on it because I'm concerned you might be approaching mental conditions in general the wrong way. There's a big difference between making light of such things in order to ""have a laugh"", as you say, and going too far and trivializing the conditions in the process. It's perfectly fine (and encouraged by at least two therapists I've seen, among others I've known suffering from conditions similar to my own) to make light of, joke about or generally try to laugh off the fact that you have a serious condition. This is a personal thing that really boils down to individual preference; if someone wants to crack an ""overthinking sucks"" joke or be sarcastic (""not getting out of bed for days sure is relaxing!"") about it, that's perfectly okay. You can't project their ways of coping onto what does and doesn't work for you or vice-versa, it's frankly short-sighted and potentially hurtful. But, yes, a line has to be drawn, and I would hope that we as a community of (mostly) actual sufferers of similar mental disorders wouldn't entertain the idea of trivializing our suffering by buying any of this shitty merch or otherwise downplaying the seriousness of living with such things. It's hard enough living with false diagnoses and self-diagnoses that totally miss the mark, we don't need to pile on with $20 t-shirts and quippy bumper stickers."

TrueFilm,f8on2c8,t3_e1duby,1574686155.0,"It doesn't have to be boiled down into any one thing. In fact, I don't think it was intended to be, and I don't think a fair analysis will ever involve saying it's about any one thing.   


For instance, I recall my first impressions of the film back when it was released were feelings of isolation, loneliness and greed. I loved the film after my first viewing and I'd guess I've seen it dozens of times since. After all that, I would argue that the film overall is primarily (not solely) about *mistrust.* I doubt I'm the first one to say so (I don't spend too much time reading film analysis/reviews as I once did so my memory is foggy), but there it is.  


To me, Daniel's greed is obvious from an early point in the film, and so is his envy/general bitterness towards others, which may stem from his greed. But more than anything, Daniel does not trust anyone, is likely incapable of doing so, and therefore has both the negative feelings towards others as a projection of his own insecurities and the desire to accumulate enough wealth and influence to not *have to trust others*.   


Of course, living with a mistrust of other people would most likely be a terribly lonely way to live, which I think Anderson and other creative decision-makers sold wonderfully with plot, dialog and cinematography. Those wide, desolate-looking exterior shots that this movie does so well create a sense of isolation and, to me at least, fear, fear of the unknown and of loneliness. which in turn is what I imagine Daniel feels around people constantly, afraid and alone. When Daniel has a near-death experience at the beginning of the film, this is the first hint at what the rest of TWBB is trying to create; one man, alone with his fear. In Daniel's case, his greatest fear is the deception and (in his mind) danger that every other person represents. The ""I abandoned my child!"" scene is his greatest and most desperate attempt at feeling anything positive about humanity, hoping to feel even the smallest amount of guilt or shame or anything at all about what he did to HW. In the end, we see nothing he's done or experienced has changed him: he disowns the man he once tried to love (and love requires, more than anything, trust) and he kills the man who, to Daniel, represented the hope he had that a higher power might have given him some sort of connection to other people in that desperate scene in the church.   


It's not that greed or envy aren't central points of Daniel's character (and of the film as a whole), but these have long seemed to me to be side effects of his mistrust of others. The ""competition"" he has in him, that line and scene being perhaps the most pivotal in terms of understanding Daniel as a person, isn't so much a drive to be better than others, but a drive to get to a point where he no longer has to depend on others for anything. Because he knows he can't, and he knows it's everyone's fault but his. That's why the last line of the film still intrigues me after all these years; was Daniel referring to finally being at peace with the fact that he cannot trust others and that there is nobody left to mistrust (aside from the butler who, let's face it, probably quits or is killed shortly after the film ends)? Or is he referring to his failure to ever learn how to trust, that there's some possible underlying desire still there but that he now knows he has run out of chances?   


Whatever the case may be, TWWB can be subjected to analysis from a multitude of different perspectives, none of which are necessarily wrong but, in the spirit of the film itself, are never completely accurate if they focus on any one aspect. Daniel's mistrust, greed, fear, envy, jealousy, anger, hatred, and possible desire to not be consumed by those things all come into play and should be addressed. I personally think his mistrust is the central point to which all other aspects branch from, but it could just as easily be greed, envy, etc."
reddeadredemption,f89b5gv,t3_dzj1hc,1574370137.0,"This is awesome and also made me more self-aware of what I do with my guns. Finished 2 playthroughs and, for what it's worth, my Arthur seemed to want to make every gun ""his"" in some way. They didn't have to be pure gold/silver or involve every decorative choice, but some sort of distinguishing characteristic *had* to be made. I think this makes sense in a sort of RP way where you live in a camp with others who own their own weapons, even if they're not seen, and assume an unmarked gun could easily be misplaced and picked up by someone else. My Arthur has a need for reliability and efficiency, and therefore needs to be able to tell his gun(s) out of a lineup so he knows he's maintained them personally and grown comfortable in their use.   


I would have loved to see further customization options as the game progressed, such as custom engravings or carvings (not sure how realistic that would be with the game mechanics) or at least some that have more personal meaning to the choices you've made or things you've experienced. And I might be in the minority with this, but I've named all of my guns (or at least the ones I end up using regularly or spending time to customize) and a naming option like with horses would have been cool too. I know this wasn't/isn't unheard of, naming your gun(s), and I imagine it would be less uncommon among those who ""lived by the gun"" as Arthur and the gang so often did.   


Also, a lot of gold/silver work is now, in my mind, most appropriate for RPing a ""bad"" Arthur, who would care more about the prestige and notoriety of carrying those weapons openly. Sort of flaunting his outlaw status. I suddenly feel ashamed of my pure silver matching semi-autos."

At some point I believe Al says something regarding killing Hearst to the effect of ""Kill one and a dozen more sprout up"". So, early on, killing Hearst wouldn't have necessarily been the best move. But once people start dying, all of Hearst's guns are in camp and he's threatening to tear it all down? Yeah, it's time to cut the head off the snake. Without his money and influence, and considering he has no real friends or close personal associates still alive besides Aunt Lou (and she hates the man), nobody was going to retaliate. Eventually someone else with money and influence would have come along to attempt a similar takeover, but that's beside the point.   


And, yeah, the emotional connection between the viewer and Trixie is obviously going to make most people say ""don't kill her, kill the other one"". I'm not arguing that. But, the cold hard facts of the situation were that Trixie, despite deserving punishment (perhaps death, perhaps not) for shooting Hearst, was important to Al, Sol, Seth, and many others in the camp...while Jen was a mostly anonymous prostitute that Johnny took a liking to. It may be morally ugly to look at it that way, but in reality these types of situations happen (morally/ethically controversial) where either decision is going to leave you feeling the way you feel.

&#x200B;

It wasn't. Remember, we saw Hearst threaten the livelihood of every single person in the camp, not just those who stood up to his bullying. This entire situation with Jen and Trixie wouldn't have happened if Hearst hadn't have had Elsworth shot (not justifying Trixie's reaction necessarily, but in the cause and effect, Hearst was the cause of all of this).   


Most importantly I think you have to consider what Hearst would have done *without* proof that whomever shot him was dead. He immediately left camp after confirming Jen's body as the shooter (which, not sure if you haven't seen the movie or not, but comes up again in that), but would he have been so quick to leave otherwise? Consistently, Hearst shows to be someone who has a deep-rooted desire to see others bend to his whim, whether it be in his dealings with gold or other seemingly random circumstances (such as how he treated Cy like a dog or had Al's fingers chopped off). I think it's fair to say that, had Al not given Hearst the satisfaction of a dead woman, regardless of who it was, that Hearst most likely would have either torn Deadwood down right then and there or, most likely, left and had it done once he was safely out of harm's way.   


I get what you're saying about Bullock's morality, but ultimately I have to imagine (and look at past examples of such) that he was willing to stretch what he otherwise wouldn't accept when it came to the ""good of the camp"". He would have been disgusted had he known Jen was going to be killed prior to it happening, and he was *always* disgusted with his dealings with Al...but he put the greater good ahead of his personal feelings in most cases.   


tl;dr: Hearst was the worst, Bullock did something wrong but did it for the right reasons (which is always going to cause conflict with others who morally align with that particular character or whatever) and Jen being killed was in no way worse than the shit Hearst had done, or would most likely do had he been denied the satisfaction of seeing her dead."

I've tried shuffling other playlists, creating a new one just to see what would happen, and I get none of this. What am I doing that's different than everyone else? I feel like if I could pinpoint that, it might solve the issue for some people. I'm wondering if the algorithm takes into account how often you listen to particular songs and then prioritizes them when shuffling? That's the only thing I can think of, but even that doesn't make much sense because I can think of many examples of new songs/albums being dropped that I listened to exclusively for a day or three and then shuffling my master playlist and hearing pretty much everything else on it.

ZombieSurvivalTactics,f0kgd6m,t1_f0kf717,1568678893.0,"Thanks for bringing up trade economy, because in any scenario I imagine, that's pivotal. That's **vital**. Without it, I cannot imagine such a scenario at all without the end result being extinction, depending on other variables of course. I tend to imagine people becoming specialists in necessities such as food production, medicine, information, security, etc. I imagine individuals/groups naturally gravitating towards those specialties. I imagine people generally wanting to group up in these scenarios to begin with, which may make me one of the more optimistic people involving themselves with doomsday scenarios, but so be it.   


I'm constantly on the fence with scavenging, to be honest. On one hand, I think living as nomads would be effective, but the sustainability of that lifestyle isn't great in most scenarios. I like the idea of establishing a new society, but within it I think scavenging will be a continual practice parallel to setting up self-sustaining means of food production and such. It's going to take massive efforts to learn how to produce even basic medicines and food staples, proper storage, even the most basic things like establishing routines of security patrols and ""jobs"" for individuals in a group. No matter what, some people are going to have to scavenge, venturing out further and further as need be, possibly encountering other living who may or may not be willing to barter or otherwise connect themselves with ""our"" society. And yes, human history being what it is, I imagine none of this would go all that smoothly, but it's honestly the way I approach these things because, again, without community and teamwork, we're doomed as a species with or without a doomsday scenario taking place."

Where does the outbreak begin? What's the initial response look like? How far is it spreading, and how quickly? Blah, blah, blah.   


The numerous scales you have to adjust simply to line up whether or not we're on the same page make this entire discussion *nearly* pointless even in the make-believe we're interacting with. I'll concede that endorsing a public library as a safehouse in an *expected* scenario for the *average* individual is inadvisable, and if you're going to paint my idea into a corner as you have with the scenario you're imagining, absolutely wrong.

ZombieSurvivalTactics,f0kcz3i,t1_f0kc1yw,1568676409.0,"This is boiling down to relativity and subjectivity here, no? When I say ""ideal"", I mean once your survival needs are met, which in my mind wouldn't be as difficult as you make it out to be. I already live in a region where self-survival practices are commonplace (hunting, fishing, farming, isolated living, etc). Community here is more tight-knit than I've experienced living in other more densely populated areas, so I'd expect easier cooperation between the living than you might in your area. Low population towns split across long distances of wilderness (Adirondack mountains). Here, a library is going to be far more ideal than it would be in, say, NYC or L.A. or even smaller cities/densely populated areas. There might be 7 billion people in the world, but most of them ain't here.   


I don't know where you're getting this library information from, but it's...wrong. Again though, this is my experience talking. I used to frequent a library in the Tri-lakes area that had a large, fenced-in garden behind it where food was grown and donated to the food pantry...which was three buildings down. It was structured in a way where there was basically one large room with several smaller rooms branching off, one primary entrance, one private entrance, one floor with a basement for storage that had one access point from inside. Windows were sparse, and the grounds it sat on had several acres available for defensive purposes, or whatever else.   


You *can* live in a library sustainably, it just boils down to the specifics. Relative to your situation and subject to your desires/experience, ultimately."
ZombieSurvivalTactics,f0kbn8t,t1_f0k97jz,1568675384.0,"A library, typically, will have more than a few books. It will have thousands. And among them will be technical books, records, information that will be necessary in a scenario where electricity/servers start going down. Hell, you might even be able to find information on how to salvage those resources.   


The entertainment/distraction aspect is psychologically viable and important. I'm not the first to address it (there's a section in the ZSG dedicated to it). At some point, if you're secure and have a decent amount of people in your group, routines of defense and collecting/making supplies are set, these extracurricular activities are going to become vital. So, sure, bring a few books at the onset, but at some point libraries are going to be necessities even if they're not your first choice to set up shop."
ZombieSurvivalTactics,f0kb870,t1_f0k48qe,1568675064.0,"Of all the public places one could go, a library is going to be low on most people's lists.

To top it off, I'll again mention that this is something to consider *after* your defenses and vital resources are covered. The words ""ideal situation"" are key here.   


At some point, libraries have to become priority targets for securing just the technical information on-hand, and, again ideally, would not make terrible spots to set up shop. A lot of that would obviously depend on building structure/location and such, but that would go for any spot really."

Amid all the preparations one can make, I feel like these areas would be ignored by most, sadly. A book or two, something interactive that takes batteries (nothing wholly dependent on electricity unless you have a generator and ample fuel), stuff like that. In an ideal situation your preparations and defenses will be solid, and...then what? Living in survival mode is not sustainable, most people will be driven mad without things to divert their attention from fight-or-flight and constant worry.   


This is why I would scout libraries as potential safehouses, for that wealth of distracting books/magazines along with technical books/documents and computers. Some might even have preinstalled generators. I know in my area (upstate NY) there are two libraries I've used where this is the case."
