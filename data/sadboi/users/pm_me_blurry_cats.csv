After his death they rejected her application due to gender, being polish (and suspected Jewish), and a scandal involving an affair with a married man.

The late 1800s was especially sexist in France, and Curie definitely paved the way for progress in the field, but she was able to obtain her degree and find success well before the rejection of the academy.

seduction,fgxluu3,t3_f0sf1v,1581174067.0,"Well the joke you made is not funny and barely has any context to the girl.  American media is steeped with cold war bogeymen and propaganda about Russia that either doesn't apply anymore or never did. Girls in Russia don't think about the old secret police on the reg.

If your humor is hit and miss then you need to work on your delivery, timing, or just the relatability of your jokes. Finding common ground and relatable context is necessary for humor to work. That's why so many comics turn to observational humor because things like lines at grocery stores, sitting in the middle seat of an airplane, or getting the wrong food order are easy to relate to for most people.

Getting humor to work across international cultural borders is more difficult. What works in India would likely not be as funny in the US. 

You want someone that makes the same thought connections you do internally. Your jokes will always make sense (and might even be funny) to a person that thinks like you and has had relatively similar life experience. 

The moral of this story is just that some people will not be matches in chat and that's ok. It's not a failure of either side. Just because I think you are pretty doesn't mean we are going to hit it off. Just unmatch without it being personal and keep trying to find the right person."
