Like I've always known it's there, but thought I could ignore it or escape it or deal with it when I grow older. This, however, exacerbated my problems and always influenced my relationships. I would victimize myself and always find something or someone to blame otherwise. It was only recently where my current relationship got really rocky and we took a break that I realized this shit has to stop. I've hurt a lot of people, including myself, and I loved a lot of people, but never myself. 

I'm currently on a self rehab process, trying to find some inner peace. I've already reached out to my parents and told them how I feel, and it felt like there's a huge weight that was being lifted from my shoulder. Now I'm finally not so angry at the world, my parents, or myself anymore. Regular counseling helps too.

That said, since 4 doesn't have HDR and that's what you're aiming for, I think you can give the BenQ a try. Test it out for yourself and if you don't like it, you can always send it back.

I started with lexapro for a few months, then switched to a much better one I’m taking now, called Brintellix. From what I was told, it’s a new prescription released in 2019 (from where I’m living in at least) that works differently than other SSRIs and have had, not to say more impact, but less reported case of downsides. With this one, I feel like I have a clearer mind, which helps me in confronting my issues, accepting myself, and embracing hope. Then again, I’m never one to run away from facing the hard truth. Still, the fact of the matter is, you’ll have to understand that change can only come from within. Meaning, you’ll have to work with yourself, get even more familiar or intune with the body, and try to develop trust in yourself. Next, you’ll have to locate the trigger point and the root of all your afflictions, which for are my family and parents. Only once you identify them can you correctly resolve them, because you could be working hard to get better, but it’s not going to fix your main issues if you’re focusing on the wrong thing. 

Starting to want to change is always difficult. Like it took so much for me to seek professional help because I thought I could get better on my own. Now I regret now going to one sooner. And, not to say life is now perfect, but I can actually see big progress with each few days, weeks, month, and now a year. To wrap it up, things aren’t going to get better if we don’t push forward. From what I read of your sharing, it seems like you know this isn’t good either, especially to your health. I don’t care if this is weird or corny, but I want you to know that I trust that you’ll be able to pull through and come out stronger. It’s not going to be easy and it’s going to take some time, but things will slowly become better, just as I’m experiencing now. You can do it, friend. I know you can.

You don't need a huge group, as long as there are people who truly cares about you. Please don't give up. Age and time will calm you down. That much I can attest to.

I have my fair share of stuggle too. Ironic thing is I've never once thought that I was a good person one day in my life until recently. Really never too late to get help and it's really goin to change your life if you try, eh."

It was really meaningful to me the first I heard it so maybe it will give you some perspective. Even though it might not do you any good, I just want to let you know that this is a place of love and it's given freely.

 Heed others' suggestions below. There is really no shame in seeking help. Looking back, my only regret is not seeking help for my issues sooner! It really is a life changer, especially if you work hard on it. Things have been better and better each months/year. I hope it can be the same for you. Please, don't give up."

BenQ,f9pfog3,t1_f9pb89p,1575533661.0,"Ughhhh Christmas sales couldn't come any sooner. Let us know how Black eQualizer or HDRi works out for ya, but my money is still most likely on EX2780Q."
Monitors,f9pffss,t3_e3gx17,1575533323.0,"I'm looking to buy the EX2780Q soon too. I saw it first hand when BenQ was hosting an exhibition near my city. I did remember someone asking whether or not the monitor is compatible with Gsync, and the answer given was to not focus so much about full compatibility, as Freesync monitors nowadays will work more or less with Gsync. The list you see on those Freesync monitors list are those that are 100% compatible. To give you an example, my friend next door uses his EX3501R and even though it's not on the compatibility list, but still works fine with Gsync."
ultrawidemasterrace,f9pdl0g,t3_e48q9e,1575530894.0,"Well, my friend next door loves his EX3501R. Samsung makes better panel overall imo, but I think the BenQ has a more complete features for their monitors. For me, I'm aiming for the EX2780Q, but if I were playing anything competitively (was before), then I would go for a TN panel just for that purpose and especially for FPS games honestly. They get bad names when it comes to color performance, but the speed and response time are unprecedented, so you really have to be sure about how you want to spend your budget. If you don't play seriously, then either will do fine."
buildapc,f9ma6td,t1_f9jklxf,1575448387.0,"I really want this one for the HDRi and IPS panel, two of which I never had the pleasure of experiencing before. Let me know how it goes! Maybe I'll get it on Christmas or during the new year."
buildapc,f9m8zkr,t1_f9m76f8,1575446732.0,"Oh actually, I think the viewsonic one has an IPS panel too. May have looked at the wrong model or is predecessor. Anyway, found this comparison chart to help with your decision. The majority of specs are the same, but you'll see that the EX2780Q has DCI-P3 for its color, which is the newest color standard trend lately. It's what makes the colors really, really vibrant if you're into that sort of thing. Not to mention HDR XD

buildapc,f9m6g2t,t3_e5e0f8,1575443479.0,"Since no one suggested another monitor, I figure I'd give it a shot seeing you're already using one of their monitor. If you were to ask me, I would definitely go with the EX2780Q instead because although it is roughly the same price as the viewsonic in your chart, it has a better design and screen clarity imo, as well as an IPS panel for vibrant colors, HDRi, and their widely acclaimed speakers. I've seen this monitor first-hand when BenQ was hosting an exhibition in my city and it's just one of the best I've seen all year. If you're fine with VA (personal preference thing) and curved monitor right next to your second screen, then go with the viewsonic one. If your budget and setup is flexible, give this one a consideration for sure."

Anger,f9lyjzs,t3_e5ax1m,1575435567.0,"Honestly, this was the first thing that made so much sense online. Other than that, my next book to read is also about anger management, called “Rage” by Ronald Potter-Efron. I find that being aware of the issue + taking measures to get better will keep me more focus on my priorities in general. How about you? Any recommendations?"
Anger,f9lh708,t1_f9kock0,1575423008.0,"I realize what it is, but its substance shouldn't be ignored. IMO, every point hits home for me. 100% relatable. It gave me great insight into understanding the root of my problem, especially the trigger points, so thought I might share it if did me some good."
Anger,f9jazcx,t3_e5ax1m,1575364766.0,"Thank you for sharing. It’s really great that you acknowledge this as problem. If by experience, your next step would be to find the trigger point for your outbursts. This can be quite challenging since the problems can be deeply rooted in the past, but knowing what they are will be half of the battle because you really can’t do much about your anger if you’re focusing on the wrong issue. It is essential to getting better because anger issues for a lot of us has become both biological and psychological. I could go on, but I think this video explains it best on why you’re experiencing this and what steps must be done to get better - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7KQsS2kLM4&feature=youtu.be

Don’t give up."
Anger,f99532o,t1_f98tgbl,1575187175.0,"Indeed. Based on your description, the issue might be rooted deeply in your past and you are basically reacting to a certain type of emotions and triggers similarity to the past. Finding the trigger point is half the battle, and it’ll help you overcome any issues much faster, and more efficiently. Besides this, a general strategy to make you calm in short and long term will be extremely useful as well."
