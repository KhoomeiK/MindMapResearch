relationship_advice,fp5wpp0,t3_gbibwb,1588341543.0,"The real issue to me is the secrecy aspect. Whether or not there was any infidelity (even of the emotional variety), the bigger issue is keeping secrets. My husband isn't a big social media guy- he's never really had Snapchat, has his own Facebook but primarily uses mine, and doesn't do Reddit or anything similar. However, he is aware of what sites I'm on- it's something that does come up in conversation, and I have nothing to hide. I actually ended up deleting Snapchat awhile back- it was far too easy for people to be flirtatious, even in the content some people posted on their stories. When it came down to it, my relationship is more important to me than that social media. I've similarly defriended exes on social media because my husband was uncomfortable with the friendship.

Any of us can speculate, but it's going to come down to you and him having a dialogue about what is acceptable in your relationship. I'm a female and have always been ""one of the guys"" but realized as much as I may want to give them a pass as a buddy, sometimes their intentions weren't as pure as mine, even in a friendship. And that's where I've had to set boundaries, including distancing myself. The communication is a really big place for things to start for you two. While we all need to get perspective and support, venting about your relationship to members of the opposite sex (in a heterosexual relationship) has the potential to turn sour. The fact that he thought you would ""accuse him of cheating"" and continued to keep it a secret is a red flag to me."

Anxiety,fosbkoc,t3_g8v0l8,1588027523.0,"Yes! I am actually still going into work onsite which has been a godsend. I think if I was stuck at home my agoraphobia would come back in full force- I've seen that happen when I am at home for a few days straight. Going out on my own, especially driving, becomes very anxiety producing. I have also heard people saying that they anticipate crowds and lots of people will be overly stimulating, and I think that will be true. 

I seem to find for myself and fellow anxiety sufferers that we are handling the quarantine better than people who don't have anxiety. It's as though this is our default mode materializing, and we have the capability to handle it. Something I am finding immensely helpful has been to go for long walks or runs in local parks and neighborhoods. Getting outside, away from my house by myself forces me to push past any feelings of anxiety and discomfort that arise- and that has always been the most effective antidote to anxiety that I've known."
Fencesitter,fosasgh,t3_g8mj45,1588027103.0,"Hey OP, I can relate to some parts of your story. My now husband (then boyfriend) and I got pregnant a few months into our relationship. We too had an oops, despite being told my husband would likely have a very difficult time with his fertility, if able to produce viable sperm at all. It was one lapse in judgement that led to the pregnancy. I was raised in a religious family that was very pro-life, to where I participated in the March for Life in high school.

That being said- when I did get pregnant, I was absolutely terrified. Our relationship was still new, less than 6 months in. We both have decent jobs, but live in separate states from our families, and mine would definitely have been far from supportive of me having a baby out of wedlock (to where my mother might even disown me). There is definitely some serious dysfunction in our families as well which would make us hesitant about bringing a child into. To help us look further into our decision, we investigated some of the various costs associated with raising a child where we live. To say the least..it was staggering. My husband was still paying off (and still continues to!) pay off his student loans, I was and am paying off my car. We also discussed the possibility that there were no guarantees the child would be in perfect health, and might require extra resources. Both my husband and I have struggled with mental health and addiction, and those issues have ran heavily in our family as well.

What really helped me above all else was a distant cousin of my mother's that I am close to telling me ""No matter what you chose, it will be the right decision for you."" I needed that confidence. I decided (with my now husband's support) to terminate the pregnancy. Since that time, I have gotten married, started grad school, had advancement in my career, traveled, and really had a beautiful life. I was definitely a fence sitter but i 110% am grateful every day for the decision I made. I have had ups and downs financially and with my mental health (as has my husband) and we realize that a child would very much complicate these matters for us. Being child free has allowed us to grow our lives, our relationship and our well being. My husband went on to have a vasectomy. Had I continued the pregnancy, I don't know where I would be mentally, or if my relationship would have survived. Might sound silly, but making a pros and cons list really helped me. My husband agreed to support me in whatever I decided, and did not pressure me. The way he was so supportive (taking off work for the appointments, caring for me through the physical and emotional discomfort) actually was a big part of how I knew he was ""the one"" I wanted to spend my life with.

Can't help but wonder if things might have been different if my mom let the kid who came from a good family and knew us to babysit.

That being said, I was forced into babysitting and being a camp counselor growing up. Wasn't into kids then, and I'm definitely not into kids now.

Look up AA intergroup in your area, and see if they have a hotline you can call. You may be able to get connected with a member who can be a familiar face (or voice) to take you to your first meeting."
childfree,fftczuc,t1_ffs7vl6,1580216860.0,"THIS. You'd think it would be preferable for someone to be upfront about this..the child isn't going anywhere, parenthood is part of that person's life. I feel like if that was me, I would want a partner to be upfront before things got serious. Heck, back in my dating days, I was upfront that I did not want kids, and wouldn't consider dating someone who was a parent for that reason."
alcoholicsanonymous,fftbs12,t3_ev52cc,1580215711.0,"Welcome!! <3 I relate a lot to your experience. It can and it does get better!! I came to AA when I had just turned 26, I'm 31 now and stayed sober since. I doubt I would be alive, much less happy, employed, married, and healthy. Have you been able to check out any meetings near you?"

I unfortunately had a very judgmental obgyn when I had an unplanned pregnancy and mentioned I was considering abortion. Completely shamed me and was highly unprofessional. Never went back, reported her as well."

Overlooks Peace Valley Park, I do know of a couple who got married at the park. It's one of my favorite places, there is such a beautiful energy."
Eloping,ffqj20l,t1_ffd32c7,1580135970.0,"I had a self uniting marriage in Bucks County (we are Quaker) and it was very, very easy to do. You will still need 2 witnesses to sign your marriage license. Bucks County isn't terribly far from Philly and has some hidden gems. I'd suggest looking into Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve in New Hope, PA. Tinicum Park in Erwinna, PA is another sleepy but beautiful gem."

alcoholicsanonymous,ffpbqz2,t3_eugyt7,1580091087.0,"Welcome! When I got sober, I experienced something similar with my ex. He was still very wary of me, he had heard me try to cut back and quit before. Initially, he didn't feel he needed Al-Anon. He later did check it out as one of his best friends is an active alcoholic. Our relationship started to change as I was changing- getting a sponsor, working the steps. I unfortunately had done some damage where my words were empty- he needed to see action. The change really happens in doing the steps, starting to rebuild and repair ourselves and our lives. Our breakup actually had nothing to do with my drinking, but rather us growing apart. It was a healthy and respectful breakup, and we both are happily in other relationships.

It does feel crappy. Early sobriety meant I felt very raw and vulnerable, experiencing a lot of emotions I had buried for some time. And, it was work. BUT- I can say with complete certainty, it DOES get better. I celebrated 6 years a month ago. I have experienced broken relationships healing. A girlfriend who had cut me out of her life due to my drinking and insanity is back in my life today, and was just a bridesmaid at my wedding. My parents trust me again, and come to me for advice and to help them solve problems. (I used to be the emotional liability they had to handle with kid gloves, since I constantly was going off the rails)

That's just my own experience, but I have seen countless other friends and sponsees repair broken relationships as well as form new beautiful relationships in their recovery. It helped me to remember this- the destruction and damage didn't occur overnight; it won't be solved overnight, either. But if you stay on the path..and do the work in the program, those 9th step promises can and WILL come true."

If you are on the road a lot and looking for AA audio resources, you can also listen to the Grapevine-  [http://www.aagrapevine.org/audio-portal](http://www.aagrapevine.org/audio-portal) (requires a subscription) They do have some of the books available for audio download as well, I especially like Language of the Heart and Emotional Sobriety."

It may help to get on their radar that you have issues with anxiety so if something comes up, they can work with you. It helped me when I was in a big class lecture to be able to take an exam in a separate room. You definitely aren't alone!"

It was the dress HER mother had worn to her wedding back in the 70s, and looked very 70s. Very adamant about wearing it, despite my asking her not to. Some act of God occurred and she wore the (blue) dress we had picked out- looked absolutely beautiful."
