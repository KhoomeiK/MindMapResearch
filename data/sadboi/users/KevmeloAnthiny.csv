depression,ffr1djf,t3_euln1n,1580148320.0,Something to take away from all this could be the knowledge of knowing that one day everything can just go away. All of it could end in an unexpected instant and thus you should live life how you want to!

depression,fbtgoay,t3_eeffci,1577078232.0,"I’m truly sorry to hear about your struggles. I don’t think this is good advice but it’s something that I think of everyday: the depression, loneliness, feeling of helplessness makes you angry doesn’t it? Why do you have to feel this way? Why do others thrive in life? Why do I have to be the depressed one? Why do I have to suffer?

I first thought and complained about how unfair life is but then I realized that life truly is unfair. The anger that I feel from that consumes me and drives me to do something. Use that anger to fuel you, find something to channel that anger, that depression and lose yourself in it. It might not relieve you of depression, but at least you’re being productive and getting things done definitely feels good. 

The thought of dying also runs through my brain 24/7. Have you thought about what happens after you die? Yes you’ll be relieved. But your life could end there. There might not be a heaven or hell, no continuation of your presence and mind and that’s what scares me, prevents me from ending it all. Don’t you think there’s more for you to do? 

Lmaoooooo this probably wasn’t good advice, I really hope you get through what you’re goin through big dawg, fuck em all you’re better than everyone keep that mindset"
depression,fbtg3m8,t3_eednl0,1577077665.0,"Honestly same. I wonder what my friends are doing with all this free time, why we aren’t hanging. Perhaps we have to reach out more? 

Combating loneliness, I make an effort to work out everyday and at least text a friend once, maybe make some plans, maybe check up on them. 

It’s funny because I know there’s plenty of things that I could do to combat being lonely and bored but a lot of the time I find myself surfing social media or reddit (like how I found this post). 

Good luck with the rest of break big dog, we’ll suffer together and then go back to school/college and suffer even more"
depression,fbtfgzp,t3_eebj54,1577077079.0,Hahaaaa I wish everyone in the world could read this. I wish depression and mental illness was something that was taken more seriously (it actually is day by day). Life is tough.
relationships,fbsvmpf,t3_ee6pdp,1577061454.0,"I think you’re chillin. He still loves you after so long, feel like he’d want to care for you even more after hearing these things. 

Just thinking that if I was in his shoes and the girl that I loved for many years, loved me back, this would just be something I truly wouldn’t mind working around. 

These issues aren’t serious and if they make him not love you anymore or not want to be with you anymore then he’s an ass.

Now, the way you tell him these things are important because you consider these things important right? You should tell him in person before he finds out in other ways; I do think it’s a good idea to tell him that you’re insecure of these things even if it’s inevitable and can’t be undone. If he loves you he’ll take it to heart."
depression,fbss713,t3_ee58qm,1577059606.0,"Lotta comments on here, you might not read this one but I’ll give my two cents nonetheless. 

I feel like our parents didn’t grow up knowing how impactful depression and mental illness as whole really is. They believe it’s a mindset, something that can be turned off if we really tried. 

I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety as a Junior in high school and my dad, to this day, tells me to “keep my mind clear” and to “not think bad thoughts”. He wanted me to get off the anti-depression pills as soon as possible (were pretty well off, I don’t think money was the issue). I ended up lying to my dad and therapist telling them that I’m alright now (I literally told my therapist that watching motivational videos on YouTube is what brought me out of depression and he bought it). I’m not alright LOL. 

I’m very sorry to hear that your mother joked about your depression. Our parents are supposed to be the ones who support us no matter what as well as be very focused on our wellbeing. For them to treat your illness as a joke is horrible and it’s obvious that she’d feel horrible if you ended your life early. 

I don’t think my father did anything as bad as what your mother did, but it can be said that both parents don’t really understand depression and its effects. Quite possibly, they may never understand. 

From here you have two options I think: first would be to separate yourself physically mentally emotionally from your mother. Hearing and knowing that she thinks like this is extremely detrimental towards your health and well-being. 
The second option is what I do, pretend I’m not depressed when I’m with my family. Even if it means being fake as hell, I try to put on a happy face whenver im with my family. This can only be done if you have a strong support group who knows about your issues; good friends (of which I am so grateful to have). The second option is best imo because you never know when you’re gonna need help from someone. 

This wasn’t great advice sorry lol. I hope you can figure this out and I’m sorry again that this happened to you."

Personally, it’s really weird to try and be someone’s friend when you have no mutual connections. 

Thanks tho brother appreciate you reading this post!"
youtubegaming,fbms81t,t3_ee01pu,1576988254.0,"Keep grinding don’t let one dislike or 1,000,000 dislikes stop you brother. I know it’s cliche as hell but that’s what successful people do: not care what the haters think and keep doing you. You’ll perfect your craft and find fans. 

On another note, think about why they disliked the video; maybe there’s something you can improve on? 

YouTube is tough and people are dicks lol"
dating_advice,fbmqb4a,t3_edyfx7,1576987554.0,"Having autism shouldn’t dictate what you do on a date, but being sensitive to sound does. With that being said, maybe get some ice cream and go to the park? Going on a nature walk? 

Perhaps ask her what she likes to do and see if you like it as well!"
dating_advice,fbmq090,t3_edvz73,1576987452.0,"I agree with what the first guy said, if you have doubts that cannot be relieved, that’s when you start to wonder if she’s the one or not. You could definitely make it work, but perhaps there’s someone where you have no troubles with out there."
dating_advice,fbmprnp,t3_edzoyk,1576987330.0,"You never know until you try brother! The good thing is that you already have one foot in the door: getting to know her and being friends! That’s a very important part because she feels like she can be herself. While you may be a confident guy at work, actually being someone else on the inside could have positive effects on the outcome of you trying for her; at least she knows that you’re capable in the workplace. 

I know it’s tough and you have doubts, fears of getting rejected but it’s important to remember and keep in mind that a lot of people get rejected. I’m sure you know plenty of people that get rejected that live good lives or eventually found someone else. 

I don’t think women joke about staying over at other peoples places when they had too much to drink, especially when it’s of the opposite sex (I assume she’s straight lmao) and from my POV she’s interested. Go for it!!"
depression,fbmndex,t3_edvvhg,1576986348.0,"I’m 21, about to finish college and I’m so afraid of what’s to come. I cannot imagine myself working a 9-5 and paying bills. It seems like such a stressful and depressing situation, especially when I see others truly happy doing what they’re doing; I don’t think I’ll ever find something that gives me pure joy or a sense of meaning. I keep telling myself something good can happen so don’t end it here, but I’m slowly beginning to realize life isn’t like the movies."
introvert,fbml61u,t3_edz8no,1576985435.0,I’d say you’re an introvert if I wasn’t able to choose ambivert. I’d consider myself an introvert and feel the same way you do about only a select few. My personality changes so much when I’m around them compared to when I’m in public or around people I don’t want to be around.
introvert,fbmkshf,t3_edxgwp,1576985279.0,All the time. Earphones help!
introvert,fbmf0ya,t3_edvqmn,1576982785.0,"I definitely understand how draining it can be to hang out with a bunch people, especially going to a very social place such as the pub/club. Even more so I know the feeling of loneliness/loner/loser, especially when I could’ve done something to alleviate that feeling. I simply try to stay as occupied as I can; working on things that interest me or just trying to stay immersed in something that’ll take my mind off of the socializing that my friends are doing. I think it’s important to have friends who understand that you’re an introvert and are willing to hang with just you and maybe someone else. 

I guess this wasn’t advice at all, rather just me also feeling how you’re feeling. Nonetheless, having friends is very important for an introvert, the loneliness can drive you to make some poor choices."
