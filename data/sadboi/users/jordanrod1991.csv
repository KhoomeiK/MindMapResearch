You can also introduce Morgantha here. If the PCs recieved the deed to the windmill during their dive into DH, have Morgantha offer them a free round of pies for their poor sorry souls (first hit is always free). Then have her casually explain that if they ever need more pies, she lives with her daughters in the windmill south of Vallaki. Hopefully this triggers their galaxy brains and they start moving.

CurseofStrahd,fq0oj5o,t3_ggf2po,1589035156.0,"TLDR at the end

So, we're at the Amber Temple in my group, about to delve into it's terrible underbelly. Ireena hasn't been with us for some time now, but here is her story.

They met Ireena in Little Barovia via the plot hook with the letter ""from Kolyan"". She was scared, and a little ditsy, but undeserving of the harassment she was receiving from the vampire lord, so the heroes filled a dying man's wishes and promised to get her to safety.

First, however, they needed help getting Kolyan's coffin to the church for the funeral. Strahd arrived, and stood on the border of the consecrated grounds to watch the funeral from afar. After an almost cartoonish scene where Strahd charmed Ireena, and then nearly every PC before finally boring of the antics and deciding he would come back later to speak with her (Ireena).

That night, Strahd showed up overwhelmed with emotions and brought 8 vampire spawn to swarm Kolyan's manor while he sat outside screaming to the night sky for Ireena to come to him. This battle was not so much about combat as it was keeping Ireena inside while she fought tooth and nail to get outside to see her ""lover"". The PCs pulled it off, and after a long night of abuse, Strahd finally got bored and left.


They set off first thing for Vallaki, as Donovich told then that ""Vallaki was closer, for a faster journey, but the town is full of madness. Krezk is much more fortified, but further away, so the journey may be more perilous."" They decided to stop into Vallaki just to see what it was like. Ireena got to flex her nobility muscles and persuaded the guard to let them in with a name drop. The party was colored impressed to say the least. Inside Vallaki, they encountered a TON of nonsense that ultimately ended in Ireena getting kidnapped by Izek which triggered a visit from Strahd who disintegrated Izek and then let the group continue on their way.

Before they could start their journey west to Krezk, another PCs' personal events dragged the group back to the Bonegrinder to kill the hags once and for all. On the journey back, Ireena overheard the druid and wizard discussing ""tentative"" plans to give her to Strahd because she's a liability. Well, with this info, Ireena decided that the rogue (her self appointed boyfriend, much to the displeasure of the rogue) was the only PC she could trust, and saved a her few cure wounds for him during the hag battle. The wizard almost died, and Ireena let her health wither while she clutched the rogue's arm with fear and intensity. After the battle, 2 of the 3 hags dead and the windmill on fire, our wizard FREAKED out on Ireena (in character) and told her that if they were willing to risk their lives for Ireena she needed to keep them alive to do it. It was a really awesome scene and definitely evoked some real emotion from the players. Ireena sang a different tune moving forward, and the party was finally warming up to her... *but this is Barovia, sooo...*

Then she died lol she helped them defeat the evil druids at the WoW, and was so happy to have a drink of wine with everyone when they finally made it to Krezk. They were having a lovely time until suddenly a loud, but firm and gentle voice rung out across the lake shore like a beautiful golden bell. The voice was coming from the wooden statue inside the gazebo. It called out to Krezk ""Tatyana! My love! Come to me!"" Ireena got hit with a thousand yard stare for a second before her mannerisms and accent changed. She started pushing through the crowd, following his powerful voice. As she crossed the threshold of the gazebo, her form changed to that of Tatyana, and the statue begin flowing a beautiful warm light. When it faded, the wooden statue was a young, smiling Sergei. The two exchanged a quick expression of love before embracing. On their contact, the entire gazebo shot up in divine flames and a red thunder rolled across the sky.

#""She is *mine!*""

 Strahd's voice rolled out across the clouds. When the divine fire faded, and that was left were two skeletons, holding each other in the brunt down rubble of the gazebo.

TLDR Ireena started off as a somewhat annoying damsel in distress but after some character development with the PCs she became a loved member of the party just in time to Marlee and Me her away from the party via the Something Blue Event. After this scene, Strahd killed 3 PCs and all of Krezk (minus the Abbott). Hope this was helpful! AMA"

Knowing that an ever watchful incel vampire lord is just outside their perferals really sets the tone. It isnt so much about *showing* them that Strahd is a threat, but about making them *believe* Strahd is a threat. My one group just had a run in with Strahd at Tsolenka Pass. They got him within hit points of death before he ethereal'd out of there on Beaucy. This gave some of my players a huge confidence boost. They were convinced that they were finally powerful enough to not be afraid of him (at level 9, mind you). Our monk was quick to bring up that inside Ravenloft, the battle will probably go completely different because he'll have all his stuff around him. I gently mentioned that they haven't even seen all of his features and abilities yet, and the energy at the table shifted. My cleric has the most gungho attitude of the group, and is still just as brave as ever. The rest of them are as afraid of Strahd as they've ever been"
CurseofStrahd,fpvhj7v,t3_gfsal0,1588944900.0,"So, TBH, I've ran CoS twice. The first group I ran as written, and the second group I dropped an hour south of Vallaki in the Svalich Woods (somewhat similar to your group). My first group was beckoned my Strahd pretending to be Kolyan, they met Ismark and Ireena, and immediately felt the desire to help her. I made a a post about this almost a year ago, but my group is all female players, and I think this is why they felt so instantly drawn to help her. They carried her across Barovia until her final climactic scene at Krezk via the Something Blue event.

My second group is a COMPLETELY different experience. They finished the winery chapters (the druids at the WoW and Wintersplinter) before even going one inch east of Vallaki down the Svalich Road. By the time they went to little Barovia, they had already had dinner with Strahd (technically brunch), and were working on their personal goal of defeating Strahd and possibly taking over Ravenloft for themselves (this mentality has changed since lol). So when Strahd showed up to Kolyan's wedding, the PCs let him have her, for fear of getting in the way of his plans. This promptly led to Ismark and Donavich kicking them out of Barovia and essentially calling them inhuman monsters. They recieved a wedding invite from Strahd 2 days later lol

With that being said, I think it depends on your group. Ireena's relevance directly correlates to how much your group RPs and gets invested in your NPCs. If they tend to view NPCs as baggage rather than allies and dont really engage that much, let Strahd take her. They'll have more fun at the wedding. If your group RPs and cares about the story and your NPCs, do the Ireena plot. It's really worth while IMO"

It is commonly accepted that there is no inch of Barovia barred from Strahd's entrance, because the entire demiplane of Barovia *is* his home.

He stands outside the building with a cross face and leaves, playing the role of foiled villain. When this circumstance arises a second time, reveal that Strahd is not bound by normal vampire rules and have him chase the PCs right into their building.

Tbh, while I dont think they are a very interesting villain in regards to WDDH, it is a *very* easy swap to have the Cassalanters worshipping a Dark Power, maybe even Vampyr itself. You can keep everything exactly the same as written, maybe take a few notes from Fiona Wachter in chapter 4 (she's a ""secret"" cultist leader in the town of Vallaki), and just swap the devil they're dealing with to one of the Dark Powers. I'd suggest Zudun, as he correlates to bringing things back to life, and is also referenced much later in CoS by Kasimir when he delves into the AT to revive his sister. The Dark Powers are *very* vague (and very much a point of contention on the subreddit lol) which leaves their interpretation up to you! Pretty easy to bend to your needs. There is also one sarcophagus in the AT that is broken, giving an air of ""escaped DP"". This could also be one you make up, since none of them are really about money.

WaterdeepDragonHeist,fp2i014,t3_ga23al,1588262088.0,"Tbh, I think you would save yourself a lot of time and headaches if you just let ""drug trade"" fall under alchemy and have it be a mostly legal, if not seedy, trade sanctioned by the code legal. If you wanna make it more of a criminal underbelly plot point, I would say the smuggling of ill gotten goods is illegal regardless of what said goods are? This puts the least amount of work on you while keeping the world in tact and letting your player pursue their goals.

If you wanna get them involved in the criminal end of things, have them get jumped for their drugs by some high level gang members, do your absolute best to knock them unconscious and steal the drugs, and show them the dangers of getting involved in this line of work. If they're cut out for it, have either Zhents or XG members approach the group and see if they're interested in an alliance. The zhents would be a more sincere alliance, if not somewhat shady, and the XG members would obviously murder the PCs and take all their money but might provide more back up in combat or quicker access to fences for magic items etc.

Just some ideas for you!"
WaterdeepDragonHeist,fp22953,t3_gat2ro,1588253634.0,"Hi! Coming over from the CoS subreddit to tell you that this is a bad idea! The most important point of the whole campaign is that no one leaves without Strahd's permission. If your sorcerer could somehow pop in and pop out, it would arguably make them the most powerful creature in Barovia. The way you integrate CoS into other campaigns is via the Vistani. I'm not going to go into full detail of the campaign here for spoilers, but they are essentially gypsies that have Strahd's blessing to come and go from Barovia as they please. The most common plot hook is that a Vistani offers the heroes a letter from a Barovian noble asking them to come to Barovia and help his daughter, who has been bitten by a vampire!

It might be better to have a few Vistani enjoying themselves at the Yawning Portal, or maybe, once it gets started, they are patrons at Trollskull. I dont mean to shut down your idea, but it would *certainly* bite you in the ass down the road. Strahd can take an interest in heroes without ever meeting them or seeing them. He sends the Vistani out to retrieve them. Sometimes the Dark Powers just scoop people up into Barovia, as well, without any say from Strahd. They never scoop them back out, though."
CurseofStrahd,fp21djz,t3_gahd44,1588253072.0,"If they dont care, better for Strahd.

CurseofStrahd,fp204ot,t3_gakb4k,1588252262.0,"VR's tower became the central hub for both my groups, since the anyinagic field and puzzle door make them feel extremely safe.

Unless VR is your party's fated ally, he functions as a pool of information, a plot point to bounce off of Ez, and he has one scroll of raise dead should the party get stuck in a pinch. When vampire spawn showed up at St Andral's to burn it down and eat everyone as they ran out screaming, put barbarian died inside the burning church, separate from the entire rest of the party. The barbarian's eyes magically opened as the familiar but unexpected face of Rictavio was there to save the day. He quickly told him if they needed anything, they could find him at the tower. Regardless of your situation, if at any point during the campaign they need to bring someone back from the dead, VR is supposed to show up and leave them a scroll of raise dead *mysteriouslyyyy*.

I *also* plan on having him show up TA DA last minute anime style to battle Strahd 1v1 while the party handles the minions. This battle will be mostly cinematic (I'll roll dice, but VR cant survive this fight for story purposes) ending with VR's death at the hands of Strahd. This will send Ez into a tizzy and she will focus all her efforts on killing Strahd. Without PC intervention this, of course, will not end well for her, either.

Most DMs give Strahd the final gemstone, since ""it's been gone so long no one remembers"" it only seems fair to give it to the oldest guy here. In my campaign, he used the gem to make the HoS, and he can use the gem to reform it with an 8 hour ritual after it's been destroyed. My PCs dont really care about the winery or the gems (in either group, so maybe that's my fault), so they haven't been on much of a hunt for them. They have 2 of the 3 gems and honestly dont even remember they have them. It feels like a low level fetch quest by the time you're delving into the AT and fighting off the psychic advances of eldritch horrors lol"

Tombofannihilation,fovmwvo,t3_g9eubi,1588104020.0,"I love redoing the adventure as a treasure hunt. There are 4 ancient artifacts hidden away inside the tomb, and your heroes get invited on an adventure for fame and riches beyond their wildest dreams! As they explore the jungle in search of the lost city of Omu, they'll encounter Red Wizards searching for a powerful device said to be capable of great evil, the Soulmonger. Set this campaign *before* Acererak actually begins his plot to set the Atropal in motion. As they explore Omu looking for the lost treasures, it should slowly become apparent to them that they must be hidden somewhere deeper beneath Omu... in the Tomb itself. Bag of Nails is a great intro to this, since he came here specifically for one of the treasures, and other plot hooks (the Yellow Banner, Fenthaza, and Princess Marawanxe or whatever) exist in the world to point to the treasures actually being hidden deeper. Should they delve too deep, their treasure hunt will turn into something much larger as they discover the skeleton keys, the evil hags, Withers, and Acererak himself should they dare enter the final room.

IMO it really puts emphasis on the actual exploration of the tomb without the time crunch pushing you to the bottom. As regular treasure hunters, your only real goal is to get as many treasures as you're willing to risk your life for and then leave. Should you decide to adopt the mantle of ""hero"" and defeat the Soulmonger and Acererak himself, then good on you."

I would just run him RAW and see how he fares? With his low HP, he should really function more as a knowledge pool than something that could feasibly protect them from the beasts of the jungle. Similar to how I run Orvex in Omu, he has so many points of exhaustion that for much of Omu (assuming he survives 4 days) he simply crawls around and tries his best to tell the PCs about their surroundings.

TLDR the guide doesnt need to be good at combat, just good at understanding the jungle so they can make nature and survival checks with ADV rather than the PCs making them ""blindly"" (assuming they aren't from Chult)"

My level 6 party has a paladin with 52 max HP. 2 rounds of that and she's done for! This battle really is all about strategic placement of your heroes to trap the gladiators in the pit using the game mechanics against them, which is a little bit higher level play IMO. Also, my party has all +1 weapons and shields (if they can use one) which pulls it even *MORE* in their favor! Idk, it just feels way too difficult.

Definitely have Strahd move in and kill VR in combat, preferably with a few vampire spawn and maybe wolves at his side. Killing VR is one of his top motives RAW, so he should act on this information with force. If your PCs are too powerful for him to engage physically, dont be afraid to throw 3 vamp spawn at them while he launches fireballs from behind. Only target VR and make sure he dies by Strahd's hand. Greater invisibility also works great if the going gets tough. Always bring Beaucy. The ability to jump into the ethereal is crucial for Strahd's survival once they have access to sunlight."

As far as the module goes, read the entire book twice from front to back. Ask any and all questions you have here, and discuss your concerns and ideas with other DMs. We're a very nice community of creeps 😈 dont be overwhelmed by all the locations. The chapters are pretty self contained and you wont be doing much jumping around mid session. Communicate with your players and make sure they go easy on you and understand you're new.

If you dont want to do that, I definitely wouldn't have Strahd know it is in his tomb. It just makes a lot of work for you. If Strahd knows about it, he would get working on destroying it. Maybe it's buried beneath his tomb? Or tucked inside the bedding of his coffin?"

I know that all of our heroes in our own games are all defeating Strahd every other week. But to my players, and to the people inside my campaign, this has never happened before.

I feel like I'm going off book modularly, so I also need to go off book for Strahd's character development. If they defeat Vampyr and lift the curse, Strahd is gone forever and it's really over and the PCs really win. Do you think that maybe the only reason he never got tired of ruling Barovia is because he never actually saw a way to leave? A certain Stockholm syndrome effect on Strahd himself imposed by the dimension made for him. Don't forget that Strahd is the only *true* prisoner in Barovia, he's the only one without a way out."
CurseofStrahd,fns3y4z,t1_fnr1aao,1587211881.0,"Strahd should *definitely* want to get the jump on this and kill the PC before anything can evolve from this. That may feel targeted, but your PC made a deal with a Dark Power. Life only gets worse from here lol

I will also say that charming an NPC and then killing them doesnt really follow the rules of the pact. This is up to your interpretation, but something as massively ancient and powerful as Vampyr would not be so easily tricked by enchantment magic. We forget a lot how that works socially because we dont have enchantment magic in the real world. A good example of this is charming people against their will. In the Waterdeep code legal, it superficially states that charming essentially anyone into doing something against their will is a MAJOR offense. We have something similar in the real world, it's called rohypnol.

With that being said, I do not think that killing a charmed NPC would meet the requirements of the pact. In dnd world, charming people is a parlor trick, and a nasty one at that. It doesnt actually convince the soul of creature you're charming that they love you, it just tricks their stupid mortal brain into thinking so. If you asked a ghost that was charmed why it did it, I always imagine the ghost would say ""I was charmed!"""
CurseofStrahd,fns3cvg,t1_fnr6619,1587211341.0,"Strahd is already dead, he's a vampire. The whole point of lifting the curse is so that he can go back to being peacefully dead and his soul can move on."
CurseofStrahd,fns39nb,t1_fnrkhfg,1587211255.0,Oh I realize that. This would obviously be a homebrewed ending to the campaign where the heroes go to some Call of Cthulu type stuff to battle Vampyr himself and save the world.
CurseofStrahd,fnqq51k,t3_g34v8n,1587169786.0,"Like most DMs, I have Strahd show up at Kolyan's funeral. He stays away, charms the party and the NPCs who get in the way of Ireena. He has no intention of taking her, just wishing her condolences for her loss. This was a really fun scene for my players because Strahd cant come onto the holy ground, so he just stands to the side charming the players until one of them finally resists. Then he rolls his eyes and mists away (my Strahd is a big fan of mist form exits)"
