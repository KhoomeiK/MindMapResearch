When he got to my place (I‚Äôm a student living one town over from him) I got in the car and he told me we would just drive around so it wouldn‚Äôt be as directly confrontational as just sitting in two chairs across from each other. 

We drove around for a bit and after a solid 15 min I finally said it. He was very sweet and basically just asked about what exactly it is I do, what I think I need from him and others, and some stuff about how it affects my studies and things like that. He made sure to let me know that he knows that it‚Äôs not a choice I made and that he‚Äôs aware that it‚Äôs very real and the same as, say, addiction. 

I‚Äôd say it went as well as it ever could. I‚Äôm so sorry that you don‚Äôt feel supported by your parents, especially since telling them must have been so hard. If you ever need someone who does know what it‚Äôs like and believes you, please message me!"

Venetian red is sooo beautiful combined with red ochre and/or realgar! My fave with it is using golden ochre as a transition, then realgar/red ochre in the inner and outer corner like a halo, and deepen that with Venetian red. You can then put a shimmer in the middle of the lid or just use tempera/golden ochre. I always get compliments when I wear this!"

I know what you mean because I use SG a whole lot more than my MR, but still I don‚Äôt think I could miss it and I‚Äôve even decided to repurchase when this one is fully panned/is no longer ok to use. Some of the shades I just love too much"
