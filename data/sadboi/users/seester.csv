But why the fuck is ""sell your possessions so you have more money"" even a fucking reasonable suggestion. 

How is it entitled to want better public transportation, so I could possibly not have a car. 

Or paid sick days so if I get sick I don't have to worry about losing money. 

Having affordable housing and food and healthcare and transportation to work aren't fucking luxuries jfc.
