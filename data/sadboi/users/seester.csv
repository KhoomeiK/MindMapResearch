How is it entitled to want better public transportation, so I could possibly not have a car.

INGREDIENTS

2 dozen precooked, frozen meatballs

1/4 cup soy sauce

1/2 cup pineapple juice

1/3 cup beef broth

1/3 cup brown sugar

1 tablespoon honey

1-2 cloves garlic, minced

1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

INSTRUCTIONS

Place meatballs in a lightly greased slow cooker.

To make teriyaki sauce: in a medium bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients until smooth.
