I think learning how to speak in front of people is a huge part of leadership. Practice that enough and pretty soon you'll have the ability to speak up when you feel the need to and people will start to look at you as a leader, even if you don't feel like one yet. As a person who is now currently in several leadership positions, it's all about faking it until you make it.
