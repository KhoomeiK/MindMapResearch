Regarding Orangetheory, it really did become something I was passionate about. I woke up one day tired of the way I looked, so I booked my free class and never looked back. I‚Äôm worried that certain things will change once we go back to our new normal, but I honestly can‚Äôt wait to go take class again.

After reading through your questionnaire and workout regimen I want to mention a few things before moving forward.  Our program can be physically and mentally challenging.  If we decide working together is a good fit it‚Äôs important for you to know up front that we require a 60 minute daily commitment to cardio - 7 days a week.  We want pure cardio burn - 60 minutes of straight cardio.  Cardio workouts should be jogging/running, spinning, speed walking/hiking on incline or elliptical on slower days.  Hot yoga could count for 1-2 days a week if you would enjoy that but not standard Vinyasa yoga.
 
We also ask that you focus 100% on cardio - good old fashion cardio ‚Äì no weight training of any kind.  You may have to adjust your current workouts or put it on hold for a while if they include weights.   Could you double up on the cardio portion during your OT workouts while others are weight training?"

However, Stassi would not be a celebrity and have the resources she does today had she not worked in the restaurant/hospitality industry. She knows what it was like to barely get by. She has spoken before about how she would pick up shifts at Sur sometimes just to get the comped meal so she could eat that day. It‚Äôs pretty tone deaf, in my opinion, for her to miss the experience of dining out without acknowledging those who are struggling now. 

I too miss the social aspect of going out and the experience you get from having a meal or drink served to you. But I also know that complaining about that publicly would incur backlash and I have 200 Instagram followers, not 2,000,000.

That being said, Stassi‚Äôs problematic behavior has carried over outside of the show. People have been quick to degrade Max and Brett for Twitter posts (rightfully so), yet Stassi somehow gets a pass for being a shit person. She has said racist things, she has victim blamed, she has been problematic off the show. That is clearly who she really is.

It‚Äôs exactly why Sandoval questioning Jax about the pastor set Jax off so much. He was used to having his problematic behavior pushed under the rug (like him creating a Twitter just to post homophobic things about James) and this was the first time he was held accountable."

She was positioned as the lead in the first two seasons and then ran away to New York. The show still survived (and even thrived) without her but her relationship fell apart and she literally came crawling back. She then came in meek and lacking all confidence to win back the cast, crew, and audience. But that was all a ruse. She scripted her own re-entry into the show and built her new basic, everyday girl brand and rode that into the sunset.

Beau has magically come in and gotten an even better edit while garnering tons of fan support just for being ‚Äúquirky‚Äù. So they are reigning supreme."

A lot of people love the editing with the flashbacks and the hokey scripted interview portions, and I just knew the producers were getting out of hand. The show was infinitely better when production merely elevated a scene rather than staged the whole thing based on favorites.

She clearly didn‚Äôt feel disrespected by him sleeping with someone else because she still got in his bed.

Saying ‚Äúomg you‚Äôre getting so tall‚Äù to a kid is totally different than saying ‚Äúomg, you‚Äôre so tall‚Äù to a man you want to fuck. Producers edited that and made her look like a total creep."

vanderpumprules,foygylw,t1_fowwvtg,1588172338.0,"In all fairness, it did seem like LVP thought Kristen was coming until Katie and Lala told her otherwise. So the table was probably already set."
vanderpumprules,foygddx,t3_ga1phd,1588172036.0,That was so gross. Beau couldn‚Äôt afford anything without Stassi and this show. Pretty sure he shouldn‚Äôt be shading anyone for their home purchases.
vanderpumprules,foyfu8k,t3_ga2jlh,1588171762.0,That was so embarrassing for Scheana. She was just trying to be nice and Nikolai was being an average young teen who didn‚Äôt want to talk to her. Production is brutal to Scheana.
vanderpumprules,foyfei3,t1_foyc2xg,1588171537.0,The best wedding show ever!
vanderpumprules,foyepvf,t3_ga9y5k,1588171176.0,"I would definitely buy this. I enjoyed Potions 1 & 2 but refuse to support Katie and Stassi again.

I had the picture of the Witches of WeHo on the side of my fridge and I ripped Stassi and Katie off and threw them out. Yes, I‚Äôm an adult. Haha"

vanderpumprules,fovd433,t3_g9faj4,1588099312.0,"I was at Sur the first day of filming for season 5, so most of the cast was there but not actually working. Brittany, however, was newly a main cast member and was on day 2 of working at Sur so she was my actual waitress. She was very nice but she couldn‚Äôt answer any questions about the menu. My friend asked what someone at another table was eating and she said the Tuna, but when it came it was definitely not what she wanted.

Katie was the most stand-offish of all the cast I met (everyone from the core group was there expect Lala, Kristen, Stassi, and Schwartz). I was walking through a room set up for filming with actors and Scheana and Katie were standing there waiting for cameras to film them ‚Äúserving‚Äù. I asked for a picture and Katie quickly dipped out but Scheana took one. I told Scheana she was so tiny and she seemed offended by that haha. 

Jax and Brittany were very nice and willing to take a picture and had me get in the middle of them. They did not seem to be mad at each other at all despite the scenes from that night of filming being all about Kristen going down on Brittany. So I definitely think that was a fake storyline for the show. 

James was by far the nicest. He stood and talked to me for 10 minutes and told me how much he loved his girlfriend (Raquel before we were really introduced to her). He was also the only one really out in the middle of everyone hanging out and being social.

Tom and Ariana were behind the main bar and it was swarmed with people, so I saw them but didn‚Äôt get to meet them. Tom had those awful hair extensions in so I did get to see those in person haha.

LVP and Ken were there as well. Ken was walking around with a dog (Puffy? Harrison? Not sure but doubt it was Giggy) and held it so people could get good pictures of him and the dog haha. LVP was very cordial to fans and even did a quick video for my friend‚Äôs sisters. We got a quick picture with her and she thanked us for coming. 

Also, Lisa‚Äôs son Max was there actually working as was Diana (‚ÄúWalk away Diana... Suck a dick!‚Äù)."
vinyl,fosqzbs,t1_fosf80m,1588036240.0,"I love this. Britney‚Äôs music brings me back to so many different times in my life (dancing around my room as a 10 year old to ...Baby One More Time, getting ready to go out in college to Blackout, playing Femme Fatale while walking to my first job in a big city...) and I love putting her on and reminiscing. I envy this vinyl collection and now need to start looking for some of these albums."
vanderpumprules,fosqcvl,t3_g99niy,1588035870.0,Hard pass.

vanderpumprules,foqzxk4,t3_g8so28,1588003768.0,"I feel terrible for Kristen but also for Nocking Point wine. They are still trying to peddle Potion #2 and have all of this negative press now. I considered ordering more recently because it‚Äôs discounted and they have free shipping currently, but I refuse to give Stassi and Katie any money for not even doing the bare minimum."
vanderpumprules,foqyjju,t1_foqsy01,1588003067.0,"I said this in another post a couple of weeks ago. Stassi is 100% one of those women who had a timeline for her life (engaged at 28, married at 30, kids from 31-35, etc.) and was desperate to keep it rolling no matter what. Once she got the ring she was fine pushing things a bit.

I still think she will be the first one pregnant. If they are able to have their Italy wedding still, she will be pregnant by the new year and Katie will follow so they can have babies together. I think that‚Äôs part of why Katie finally got a nutritionist. I think she was bordering on/or even at an overweight BMI and her doctor told her to lose 20lbs before having a baby to be as healthy as possible."
vanderpumprules,foqxwer,t1_foqhhfq,1588002749.0,"It‚Äôs pretty shocking she hasn‚Äôt gotten pregnant by now with their spray and pray method. Makes me think it may not happen for them, which might be a blessing for the world."
vanderpumprules,foqxlqp,t3_g90q4d,1588002604.0,I‚Äôm just waiting for the day Rand leaves Lala for a 22 year old who hasn‚Äôt jacked up her face yet with fillers. She better pop out a kid if she wants any of his money.
vanderpumprules,foqxcng,t1_foqkxlo,1588002479.0,"Beau is also 10 years older than Brittany, so he should be at least a bit more stable than she was when she entered the group. 

I think society has spawned this desire for fame that lots of younger people have now because it seems attainable via social media and reality tv. I can‚Äôt say I blame Brittany for wanting to get on the show as a 25 year old girl from Kentucky. She has made it in a way most of her friends could never dream of.

Beau‚Äôs trajectory has been very odd. I think he always wanted an easy ride so he started acting a bit (how he met Kristen) and that didn‚Äôt pan out so he found a commercial casting job that he could basically pick and choose when to do. It allowed him the freedom to party when he wanted to and travel for long periods of time, but still gave him the stability of a paycheck when he wanted it. 

Anyone who thinks he still works this job must also believe Brittany really did become a server again after her wedding to help pay the bills."
vanderpumprules,foqvpjr,t1_fo3jea0,1588001665.0,"I think production wanted to vilify Patrick because he caused so much turmoil for Stassi. He got her to quit the show and then her life was in disarray when she came crawl back to the show. He refused to be filmed for the show for a while and when he finally gave in, they were probably sick of his BS and wanted to show his true colors to the world and particularly to Stassi.

I truly think she would still be in an on/off relationship with him now had he not gotten such a bad edit."
vanderpumprules,fomzwy9,t1_fom2qvb,1587908730.0,He is so gorgeous in person!! And so friendly. Just meeting him for 5 minutes totally changed my perception of him.
