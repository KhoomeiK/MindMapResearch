When I go to the doctor, they have me do a little mental health thingy. A few months ago I had a really bad flu and I did it. I told her about my issues controlling my emotions, and she gave us a list of therapist offices. My mom asked me ""do you even need therapy??""

I hope that maybe one day I'll be able to do online therapy, whether my mom pays for it or not. It'll save the hassle of having to actually go places and maybe my mom won't be so off-put by the thought of it. Plus it just seems less difficult to do. Comfort of your own home, typing instead of talking, can take breaks for some nice ramen noodles or whatever.. Etc.
