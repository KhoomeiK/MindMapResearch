The first 2 months are when the ACL is the strongest it will ever be, eventually it will be its weakest at 6 months but that's because it is settling in and getting used to being an ACL."

i would be careful and wait to return to sports. 

when you do i would use a don joy brace. you can get them from insurance"

When you are doing physical therapy, ask to have graston done on your knee and scar. It is manual therapy that helps with the pain and weird sensations you are feeling. 

As for not being in pain kneeling down, that’s just something you have to get used to. The more you kneel down and literally rub your scar the easier it gets."
