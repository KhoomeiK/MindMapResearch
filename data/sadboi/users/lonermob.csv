CBDhempBuds,flvrswc,t1_flnjexe,1585530595.0,"The main issue that people have with BT is that a majority of their strain names and genetics listed are not the truth. It’s disingenuous to the cannabis community. Aside from that, they have charged a premium price for small flower in the past. I’ve only purchased some 1/8 from them in the past, Jack Indoor, Blueberry Pie, Strawberry Gelato. Neither were particularly impressive, especially compared to other growers out there."
CBDhempBuds,flvr7aw,t1_floy16n,1585530198.0,"Nobody is talking bad on Black Tie as much as they want answers behind these genetics that don’t make sense, especially when the seed breeders of the strain list the actual genetics on their website. Once again, APPLE STRUDEL is listed by the strain cultivator as a cross of cobbler x cherry blossom, yet on the BT website the genetics are listed as Green Crack x Jack Herer. Is that a typo or a lie to increase sales? Niggas really just want open transparency, especially in these times."

CBDhempBuds,floyj8b,t1_flovuv2,1585348082.0,"Honest question. So there’s a hemp strain on your website called Apple Studel. This strain is from High Alpine Genetics and the genetics are cobbler x cherry blossom. On the BT website the genetics are listed as green crack x jack herer. How did that happen?

And to my knowledge various vendors sent users free samples and in return perhaps there were many positive, but maybe not the most honest reviews, which may have gotten annoying for some consumers. One of my reviews for another company may not have shown up on the sub. Meh, no big deal for me , but I’m not a business."
hempflowers,fkskte4,t3_fkg20r,1584492344.0,White labeling is common place in the Cali cannabis business. Plenty companies are selling vape carts that are the exact same product with different strain names. It’s why I don’t use carts unless they’re live resin. I’m against people doing this for flower.
hempflowers,fksdout,t1_fksddsw,1584487758.0,"Damn that sucks to hear man. Hopefully they get that resolved in a timely manner. I’ve tried Starseed a few times, they’ve got some good flower. Personally Goat Ridge and HEMPBEST are tied for the best SSC of 2019 harvest."
