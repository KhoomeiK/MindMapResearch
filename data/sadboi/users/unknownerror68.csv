socialanxiety,fqo6368,t3_gjw9y1,1589508324.0,"I decided to comment because I went through something similar, except I was the girl. I'm mostly fine, but my bf has really bad social anxiety. I'm pretty sure he went through a similar thing asking me out, as we met online and we got really close. He actually asked me out through text and I'm pretty sure he almost passed out from the anxiety, he always told me he was shaking so hard that he must have accidentally pressed send. What I'm trying to say it, if she's like me, she probably doesn't care for it and will understand if you just explain how you feel. Make the move and don't let the self doubt and anxiety hold you back, don't resort to drugs. Just be honest with her, if she ends up hating you or thinking you're a creep then it's not worth it anyway. you never know, when my bf asked me out I was of firm belief that he deserved better than me, while he believed I would reject him because I'm out of his league. sometimes anxiety is just like that, this was a bit of a long comment lol."

I have mild social anxiety and his is a lot worse, it varied from person to person. Like, for example, I can't use push to talk because it gives me so much anxiety every time I have to push the button to talk. He's generally fine with online stuff but doesn't really talk as much. I think it's best to just talk to her, maybe even ease her into voice chat. I used to panic using vc and never did even though I wanted to, but now I'm totally ok with it and enjoy it. I won't speak for her tho, but remember most of us can seem distant and not reach out to you or text first. Doesn't mean we want to be like that."
