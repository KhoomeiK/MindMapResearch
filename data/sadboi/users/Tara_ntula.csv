These people do not have the funds to drop $500 at the drop of a hat when their 2004 Honda randomly stops working. They’re funds are usually so wrapped up that they barely have any money for saving, if they even can in the first place. Many people have to skip meals due to how little leftover money they have.

I’ve met low-income people who have left high COL cities for cheaper areas. So it definitely is possible, I’m not discrediting that. But it’s not as simple as “hop in your car and leave”.

Then this all happened. All of my friends were returning home (I started a grad program this year and most of my friends are through there), and the thought of being forced to be alone in a new city terrified me, so I decided to go back home too.

The first 3 weeks, I experienced bad days but they were mostly manageable. But the past two weeks have been brutal. Disordered eating/body image issues are coming back full force. My misophonia and general irritability is making me difficult for my family to be around. Can’t seem to enjoy time with my family without my mind spiraling.

I got notified that my summer internship is being moved to remote/online, and in order to receive the tech the company wants to send me, I need to verify my location for the summer by the end of today.

Before COVID, I was in Seattle for school, but I went back home to DC a little over a month ago. I got out of a long term relationship (and long distance for the past year) about 2 months ago. I only really know one person who is still in Seattle that I’d call a friend, but if things get better during the summer, I have the ability to do social things and meet new people/new friends. Especially meet a new partner But if things don’t open back up, I’m by myself in isolation for the whole summer.

If I stay home, I’d have my main friend group to interact with if things open up again. If things don’t open up, I have my family to stay socialized. However, I won’t be able to meet new people here and I’m not really looking to do a summer fling, so I wouldn’t be able to meet a new partner for the entirety of the summer.

I don’t plan on coming back home to DC after I graduate from my program next year. The money in my field is on the west coast, so I’ll most likely either stay in Seattle at the start of my career or move to the Bay Area.

What would you guys choose to do in this situation? Stay home (DC) for the summer or go back to the place you’ll most likely be located at for the next few years (Seattle)?"

UXDesign,fl4yczq,t1_fl4f671,1584824331.0,"It’s funny you mention puzzle solving, because if you talk to anyone I know, they’ll tell you how much I hate puzzles. But I love playing tactical video games like Fire Emblem or Divinity: Original Sin. The difference for me is that puzzles are isolated while strategy/tactics have objectives and goals attached to them. It’s also why I like making detailed plans (which goes into your attention to detail point).

For the past year that I’ve been working and getting my education in this field, I’ve realized that the ideation part of the design process is my least favorite, it’s not how I show my “creativity”. I much prefer having the concept and then figuring out how to make it a tangible, functioning thing.

Overall, I think there are different skill sets one can possess to be a good UX Designer, because there are different areas that people like to focus on. What makes a good front-end developer will have slight variation in what makes a good back-end developer, for example."

Everyone deals with insecurities. You just can’t let it run your life. He’s 15, so he’s probably going to hold out on getting taller for at least a few more years. Just continue to affirm him in other ways and remind him that he’s a great guy as he currently is."

But with the coronavirus, keeping that no contact rule has been hard. We’ve checked up on each other to make sure we’re safe and also doing okay socially and mental health-wise, but it just makes both of us miss the interactions we had. I don’t get the satisfaction talking to my friends all day that I get talking to him for just a few minutes. He was my best friend before we dated, so it feels I’m losing two people (a boyfriend and a best friend) during a really isolating time.

I’ve already lost 40 lbs in the past, and IDK how much 10 more lbs will impact how my breasts will look. My breasts deflated slightly when I initially lost weight but then regained its fullness, but I’m not sure if it’ll do that again.

So it’s between prioritizing having a more toned midsection/smaller waist or ideal boobs. Ugh."
gaming,fkmeclx,t1_fkma8n3,1584326963.0,"Looking at it more in-depth, it has to deal with more than gender.

1. There are a lot of male characters that I do not find relatable but do find interesting. As in, I’d be more than happy to watch a movie or tv show about their story, but I have no interesting in “living” their story.
2. I tend to enjoy combat that doesn’t really fit into the male power fantasy. Someone above said that guys like feeling powerful, huge, and strong, and video game characters tend to reflect that. It also means combat is more in-your-face. I’m not a huge fan of close-range combat and much prefer games that allow me to attack from a distance (archery, magic, sniping, or sneak mechanics). 
3. I also tend to like playing in worlds that are very colorful and beautiful (with Fallout being a notable exception). I like exploring and adventuring. I feel that a lot of games out there are more focused on being realistic, gritty, or pseudo-military.

If a male-led game matches most of my interests, I’ll play it. I played Catherine (I was very interested in the story). I enjoyed the Arkham games. I like LoZ. FFXV was...interesting enough. 

But the few amount of female-led games out there seem to hit all my boxes moreso than the large amount of male-led games out there."

AskWomen,fkl1eta,t3_fizejq,1584296405.0,"I wanted to cosplay for Comic-Con that was happening in May, so I started counting calories and going to the gym 2-3x a week. I didn’t reach my goal weight in time, but I did manage to get down to a healthy weight.

The next year, I got into weightlifting. So I was working out 3-4x a week while also trying to throw in some cardio. My body looked it’s best at that point. Then I stopped weightlifting and would only do cardio on-and-off, but I always kept track of my calories.

Now (3 years since I’ve lost the weight), I play sports on the weekends and run from time to time (I’ll pick it back up for a month, stop for a few months, then pick it back up again). I also still keep track of my caloric intake on a daily basis. If I overeat by a large amount, then I’ll go into a caloric deficit over the next couple of days to balance it out.

I’m on the heavier side of a healthy weight, and that always bothered me and I’ve been wanting to lose more weight. However, I think I’m finally coming to terms with my body (I think I actually look good, my breasts are full and a good size, and I’m physically active). *Maybe* I’ll attempt to lose ten more pounds.

AskWomen,fkews95,t3_fhxcf7,1584122301.0," I’ve had a high libido since I was 13-14. I would watch porn and masturbate about twice a week. Then I got my first boyfriend at 18 and I wanted sex all the time (once a day or every other day), but his libido didn’t exactly match mine. And I also put unnecessary pressure on him, which made him even less likely to want to perform. We still had sex regularly (1-2x a week), though I was the one usually initiating. Eventually, my body adjusted to the mismatch in libido and I stopped wanting sex as much.

We were long distance for the last year of our relationship, and initially I begged for us to do sexual stuff (sexting/sending pictures/etc) but eventually, I became busy with everyday life and it made me not care that he wasn’t interested. Sex with him just wasn’t on my mind very often and I would masturbate just out of boredom/routine.

Now that relationship recently ended. I’m 23 now and my libido is still high but my orgasms have been terrible probably due to the near-daily porn watching. So now I’m unsubscribing from all NSFW subreddits and I’m gonna stop watching porn and take a break from masturbation. Since I don’t plan on being in another sexual relationship for some time, I think it might be a good thing to stop having sex on my mind all the time."

I take it a day at a time. These past 3 weeks have felt long and I miss him most days. But I’ve been forcing myself to develop my relationships with others, with my friends.

It’s hard, but keeping myself busy and getting closer to my friends is helping a lot. One day, I’ll be able to go a whole day (or more) without thinking about him. And at that point, I think we can return to how we were before we started dating: really good friends.
