WitchesVsPatriarchy,fqhgupv,t1_fqhc1jm,1589376716.0,Not at all. I dislike the idea of witches feeling  they might be doing something wrong or right. If you think for a hot minute that some ancient witch wouldn't use all the tools at her disposal you can see how silly it is. Your practice should only be what feels right to you. There are no rules and witchy regulations just your own contact with the universe and what feels good. I have no doubt that you would put as much love into your machine embroidery as you would hand!!! Go for it!!!
