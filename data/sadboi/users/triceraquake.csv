And all the people of other religions. Do they all automatically go to hell? Jesus was a Jew, but Jews today won’t go to heaven because they don’t believe Jesus is the son of God? And only people who have been baptized this way and have no instruments in the church. I also loved geology and physical science but I couldn’t match an old Earth with Christianity.

But I really fell away with the attitude against homosexuals. I wouldn’t accept that someone would choose a life of persecution. Then the hypocrisy of the church members and listening to the hateful things my family members would say. I also didn’t understand the policies of the GOP which are all opposite of what Jesus and the Bible would say to do. Then finding contradictions in the Bible. Learning about Constantine and how books were omitted and edited based on what was acceptable and errors in translations. Realizing different versions convey different ideas. The Bible was written by men 100s of years apart, not a magical book written by God. It all came together pretty quick. It hit hard, I was in denial for a long time. It was uncomfortable, and I held on way too long. 

Now, I’m pretty bitter. I had a lot of fear growing up that the world was going to end and I wasn’t going to be ready. Making a child fear death constantly is so messed up. I’m positive that it had a major role in my anxiety issues.
