I get bad reviews from my managers. So I quit that job and concentrated in finding jobs that doesn't use my mouth, but either uses my strength which is not very much and my brain. I found a job in drafting. They thought me the basic and just sat in front of the computer for 8 hours, instead of getting criticized, I got praised. It boosted my confidence.

Her words fucked me up  for months. Gave me self doubt and spiraling in my head until I was near nervous breakdown. Of course she has no training, just jammed my head with her opinions relentlessly and probably self projecting from her own experience. Personal boundaries were stepped on multiple times. I didn't even give her a permission to do it. Looking back, yes she has good points, but it wasn't the right place or the right time. I was trying to make her happy and was to exhausted to stand up for myself. 

To answer your question. I wouldn't dream to doing this to another friend. Pointing an incorrect thinking takes a lot of words and time. If you are hanging out, you are expecting to have a good time and not ambush therapy. Forcing your opinion or view without training in counseling might damage the other person."
