mentalhealth,fqj3r4m,t1_fqi9x8k,1589404639.0,Second this!! It’s so soothing and you really focus on colouring rather than what’s going on in your own mind.
mentalhealth,fqj38ox,t3_gj4qz0,1589404445.0,"Self confidence always comes in time! One day you will realise that no one takes notice.
About a year ago when my anxiety was much much worse than it is now, I went to stay with my Aunty and I told her i physically couldn’t go to coles with her so I had to stay home and she told me this “not everything’s about you. I understand you’re self conscious and have anxiety going to public places but no ones going to be looking at you and secretly judging anything about your appearance. They’re not even looking at you and if they are for all you know they could be thinking you’re gorgeous. No one cares about your outer appearance. No one is perfect so get up because you’re coming to the shops with me” 
And since then that has just stuck with me. I do not walk past anyone and think anything negatively about their appearance. We’re all beautiful in our own way but that doesn’t even really matter, everything is on the inside and if you aren’t a beautiful person on the inside, your outer looks really do not matter or phase me at all. 
I’m sure you’re a beautifully souled person and that really would show on your outer! I hope you find your way to being more confident than you are and I’m sorry you’re struggling with your appearance.
We’ve all been there and it’s a tough road to becoming truly content with who you are and what you look like but honestly, every person on this earth has their insecurities and most of the time I think we’re all too busy focusing on our own insecurities rather than trying to pick out something wrong with another person. The right people love you for who you are as a person and not what physical characteristics  you do or don’t possess! I think you should ask yourself also would you rather be with someone who thinks you’re naturally an amazing person, looks wise and personality wise. Or would you rather someone only be with you because they think you’re good looking? I know Id definitely prefer someone to be with me for who I am as a person and not because they think I’m attractive. I hope things look up for you soon and that you realise you’re amazing just the way you are!"
mentalhealth,fqizwxf,t3_gj77lf,1589403153.0,"I really don’t know what advice I can give. I’m so sorry for what you went through and that you’re struggling right now. 
It’s not the same at all but sometimes when I’m so deeply depressed and overwhelmed by all of the feelings I have I feel dead and then I scare myself by thinking “wait, am I actually alive” it doesn’t last for long but I look around and have to touch everything and I end up coming back down to earth and realising I am alive. 
Anyways, honestly just pinch yourself. Say to yourself I am alive, this world is real and what you had to go through was a massive thing and that you no longer need your defence mechanism. 
If a psychologist is accessible and affordable for you I would recommend seeing a professional as they can help you with so many strategies to continue this life without any defence mechanisms at all and to also help pull yourself out of that “nothing is real” mindset. 
If you are unable to see a psychologist I am always here if you need a chat! Even if you’d like to give me a message now I’m more than willing to listen to you speak in more detail about everything if you like. 

This is just a reminder also that everything is real and that you are actually living, breathing and alive in this very moment. Your life clearly has not been easy and has had a lot of downfalls and mistreatments but now you need to try and get back to 100% and to a really happy place within yourself. Do just one good thing today to try and feel alive. Put on your favourite song so loudly and dance around and just scream “I’m alive”. That might sound a bit silly but I think that it would be worth a try. Good luck with everything and I truly hope you see the other side of this!!"

He is his own person and should try and deal with things on his own sometimes instead of putting it all on you. You aren’t a bad person, every one needs a break sometimes to focus on themselves and not be caught up with every person some one in their life has to deal with. 
Still pay him back as you said you would! Maybe try and contact him and say you would like to pay him back the money and maybe have a chat to discuss whatever is going on with the two of you? Best of luck with that situation! :)"

I also started doing the things I used to do stoned to show myself that it’s still enjoyable to do it sober. Give yourself some more time and you’ll eventually feel so good about yourself knowing you stopped smoking. You’ll get through it. In the time being, I’m always here for a chat if it gets too much.

I’m going to tell you something my Aunty said to me a while ago, I’m not sure if it will help you but I really hope it does! Back at the start of this year I wasn’t doing very well with my anxiety, I only ever left the house to go to work and to see family members at their houses. 
I was staying with my Aunty and I told her every time I go to the shops I get sharp pains in my chest and feel like vomiting because everyone stares at me. She told me the world doesn’t revolve around me and what I look like, she told me no one is staring at me and it’s all in my head. But she also said “and who are you to say they’re staring at you negatively? They could be staring at you because they think you’re gorgeous.” 
It really made me think, it helped temporarily and I really hope that helps you too!! People could be staring at you because they think you’re handsome or because you give off this really friendly vibe. Just saying, if I seen you in public I’d defs stare at you in a positive way!!

Yes, murder is a terrible thing and people are so quick to judge someone based on their actions and the fact that you can look past that and see the human being he actually is, is something not many people are capable of. Anyone who’s murdered another  is still a person and although in not every case but some cases the circumstances at the time make them do things out of character, in his case the medication obviously had an impact on his decision making.
