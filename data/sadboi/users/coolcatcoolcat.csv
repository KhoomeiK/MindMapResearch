I use a Huion 420 ran me about 40 bucks (price may vary I haven't looked in a while) but it comes with a carrying case and dust cloth which i found handy. Its a little on the smaller side so you may find you like it or want a bigger canvas to work with. 

There's also tons of free programs to work with if you work off a PC. Medibang Paint, FireAlpaca, I think Autodesk Sketchbook too. You may want to give a few a try before you settle on one you like. I went through three before I picked Medibang because I was picky about the offered brushes.

Tutorials for learning I stick with Youtube for those. There are a ton of step by step instructionals as well as speedpaints. Speedpaints won't necessarily tell you flat out how to do something but I like watching them to get ideas on how to work things from other artists.
(Edit: Addition) Proko is one of my favorites for digital painting  but there's hundreds of others based on different styles and programs, kinda just have to dive right in.
Edit: Proko is one of the main youtubers I follow but there's tons depending on which style you like or program you're using."
