I can hear people saying, Why would you isolate yourself on purpose? The problem is that CPTSD and PTSD are not these tangible, physical illnesses per se, so they are much harder for the general public to understand. Hell, it's taken myself a while to understand!

I need to start therapy again and I have been procrastinating because I know how painful the process can be. Just  keep in mind that there are more bad therapists out there than good (strictly imo), but you'll never find the good ones if you give up now.

Maybe you can discuss service continuity ahead of time with the next therapist you meet. You know, like what are conditions for early termination and whether they plan on moving on or finishing their student hours etc etc. Of course it's no guarantee but a good discussion to have."

Yesterday my friend told me in so many words that I have identity issues (because I've always shaped myself to fit into wildly different groups of friends). And while normally I had always seen it as a strength of mine, yesterday it made me feel so sad because I know the root cause of it. I never had a strong identity of my own because I grew up as an extension of my nmom. Everything I did was to please and coddle her, and adapt to her moods, likes, and dislikes.

I've only watched a few episodes of ELC and I remember loving the mom as well. Yeah she was loud and harsh at times but it wasn't abusive to me. For me, both her and Lois were working moms and very stressed, and I understood that challenge of trying to work and raise kids at the same time. Esp Lois...those kids were out of control lol. 

I am also a very independent person, but I suppose our perspectives are all just relative. I never saw Lois as overly controlling. She was just a disciplinarian. I guess you would be horrified by my parents.

Btw, what does ""sso ott"" mean?"

The thing is, even if they were physical punishments and maybe that was wrong, Lois gave them at appropriate times as consequences for her childrens' negative actions. My mom was a ""kick the dog when feeling bad"" type of parent. So I would get beaten even when I did nothing wrong, and only because she had a bad day at work and had to take it out on someone or something. And we never had any pets so guess who got the brunt of it? My mom leaned wooden sticks up against every corner of the house at all times as a reminder that I should always be submissive, and would make me fetch them when she felt like I talked to her in the ""wrong tone"" or didn't quite complete my chores to her liking.

Whenever I expressed feelings of sadness or frustration, it was almost always met with a response of anger, like ""how dare you."" How dare I ruin her mood, how dare I be anything but grateful at all times, how dare I have any feelings of my own that aren't related to hers.  Like the commenter said, same went for being sick or hurt. 

When I was 7 or 8 years old, I fell off my bike and came home crying with a bloody skinned knee. My mom was washing off my knee and she told me to stop crying. When I kept crying (because it hurt!! And I was a kid!!), she punched me in the face and the impact on my eyeglasses bruised my nose. 

Also on the flipside, whenever I expressed (independent) positive emotions like joy or excitement, she would also get upset and tell me things like ""if I can't have fun, you can't have fun"" and just generally shit all over my emotions.

Sigh. Why in the hell did I expect myself to grow up and become a ""normal"" well-functioning person?"
