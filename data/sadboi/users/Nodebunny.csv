You should allow him to decide if and when he wants to tell you, and just be supportive as you can. Whenever the opportunity arises you can signal your support. He will appreciate you so much more if you dont emotionally shock him and allow him to open up to you. You can ease it along by dropping hints. And it will allow for a better friendship. To me, telling him sounds more like a power trip/one-upmanship and not respect. Respect is allowing him to tell you on his terms aka Personal Boundaries. I don't care how nice you or anyone thinks you are. The fact that youre even blasting his name is concerning. Stop being so obsessed with him. If he thinks ur anti because of your parents them showing that you dont agree with your parents should be enough for him to open up. If not, what you suspect may be WRONG."
