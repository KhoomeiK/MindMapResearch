I understand why she might, partners usually share things, but there's no reason why she *should* have. You don't tell your husband about all the other infections you've had and have since been treated for do you? Would it be reasonable for a couple who met in 2025 to divorce BC one person didn't share they had and were treated for covid19? 

It's not OPs fault STDs are highly stigmatised. I'm sure she already feared backlash for her history

While your birth control is your own responsibility, that doesn't mean you can't ask him to help you pay for it. If you get pregnant or have a kid it will also be half his responsibility too. If anything it's so he has to pay less if there is a mistake! Abortion or having a child are not cheap!

Reach out to him, apologize and be honest - say you were scared and you panicked as you were. Which is fine because relationships can be scary. As can distance. Apologise if you mean it and acknowledge that it was the easy/cowardly thing to do. 
Make it clear that there's no pressure or expectation for him to reply 
And wish him well. 

If he wants to talk to you, he'll reply. And if sees you ghosting once as a red flag he won't reply. Or maybe he'll think about it for a while

depression,fpnxuiz,t3_gea6mo,1588774740.0,"wow relatable. I felt so bad about people not caring about me as much as i cared about them, or not caring about me as much as they care about other people. 

 I made the active decision to not reach out to people to hang out or to chat. and I knew this was a risk

because what if theyre going through something and arent really able to reach out

or what if they dont hate me but they just dont have time to reach out to people who were more than close friends

so I knew i was risking hurting other people and hurting myself. Anyway this is what i ended up doing. I do have a best friend now, but they are my partner and theyre also pretty introverted and they don't have loads of other friends so its easy to be their main friend in a way"

ADHD,ffuyiph,t3_evb0po,1580251784.0,"Hey. I'm 22 and also British. 

I cry every time I get updated about my assessment appointment. Why. Because it keeps getting further away from being an actual reality. I asked my GP for a referral in June. It never happened. Asked again in October. Said it was a 2 month wait. Fine. Then my appointment didn't get funding from the CCG. Then I called them again and again. I got referred to a different clinic and my funding got approved. They wanted ECG and blood tests. I was running all over london to these random places to get it done. Took hours and hours. Got the results sent over. Called the ADHD clinic after a few weeks. They might have recieved it but they haven't processed it yet but the next appointment is in May/June. Called them again 3 weeks later. Still hasn't been processed. Next available appointment is June/July. 

Sorry to overshare, but my point was the system is absolutely atrocious so I understand the pain.

But also... if you are terrified about medication. You don't need to get medication? its there if you feel like ADHD is ruining your life/could be improved. You can also have no treatment. You can also just choose to do CBT for it. No one's going to strap you down and force you to take stimulants. You are an adult with a non life threatening condition. You are free to respond to your diagnosis as you wish!"

it is very very very very difficult to get out of that self loathing period. I wasted the weekend and I spent all of monday hating myself more for not getting my assignments done on the weekend. but i didn't spend that time doing my assignment instead

I promise you. the three hours are no big deal. Even if you don't feel like you can redeem yourself. It doesn't matter. its just three hours. I know its so difficult. I really do. 

Something I have started doing to control my racing thoughts is either having a sticky note on my desktop or a physical note pad for any random thought that comes to my mind.....whether its actual tasks or whether its things i want to google. Literally, my sticky note is shit like ""google armenians in america. google anomaly etymology. google hui chinese ethnic group. email Prof"". i get it all out without wasting time and without feeling like i'll forget it.

ADHD,fftamjs,t3_ev4pbe,1580214567.0,"just gonna start by saying I dont have any experience in this specific scenario however I am from the UK so my perspective is just from being an NHS user. 

So. Telling your NHS GP doesn't make this information public to anyone at all. Either way, you have a diagnoses/condition, doesn't matter if its private or through the NHS, if something comes up where disclosing your ADHD was relevant, you will be considered to be with holding this information. 

Your NHS records are only accessible to healthcare teams that you (indirectly) consent to seeing your information. No one else would know about your ADHD unless ***you*** chose to share. 

\- DVLA only requires you to inform them if your ADHD effects your driving. If it doesn't, you're fine. If you get into an accident because of ADHD and you didn't disclose this, there are consequences to this. But again, only if ADHD affects driving. You are on medication so this seems likely.  ([This is what DVLA say](https://www.gov.uk/adhd-and-driving) themselves but I have heard other people saying you need to declare it anyway - and just explain it is has no impact). I personally would disclose ADHD medication to DVLA, incase something happens. Good to avoid fines and criminal prosecutions where possible. But telling your NHS GP has nothing to do with this anyway. This is something that is your personal responsibility and something you can already do with only a private diagnosis

\- Job prospects: You are not required to share anything with a potential employer and are protected by law if you disclose your conditions and it affects your application. It may even be beneficial to share this once you get the a job you have applied for, so appropriate adjustments can be made depending on what it is, but thats a personal preference/depends on the job/the employer.

\- its always up to you what pre existing conditions you declare on travel insurance. In the past I havent declared my diagnoses (that aren't adhd). This is simply because I cannot imagine a scenario where I would have to claim for these. If you do not declare them, any claims related to that diagnosis, won't be covered. You can simply use an online quote generator to see if there is a huge difference in price when declaring ADHD or not. Again - this has nothing to do with sharing with your GP. If you want ADHD coverage in your travel insurance, then you are already eligible to have this cover for a pre existing condition with your private diagnosis. And 

My knowledge of car insurance is very limited however I would imagine similar sort of logic would apply - you should declare so you are covered and if you've informed DVLA, and you can probably compare quotes to see if it makes a huge difference to your costs."
