i'm sure you're not worthless it just a feeling you're having, perhaps you arent processing other emotions right, have unprocessed grief or trauma, or something else thats not obvious.    ' I Am Enough' are words that gave me a bit of a boost

&#x200B;

 use extreme caution with meds, make sure someone you trust check with you daily for first month or two when starting new meds, a lifeline and one that will advocate for you.  Also while not trying to discount healthcare systems they sometimes miss things  or may not always find best solutions..

give yourself space and time to heal, find a therapist that can offer more than talk therapy like CBT or other strategies when you're read for those.   i found a bit of help in books from dr aziz gazipuraeven though they were on social anxiety still they offered a bit i could apply, audiobook versions of his books are excellent"

a few things to consider before  scheduling 

have and understand your exceptions of therapy, if you just want to talk to someone any therapist is likely fine, if you want to be challenged, need strategies or get to root of your issues that will be hard to find from a therapist. communicate what your looking for early either before first appointment or on first appointment. 

   i've had lots of therapy and when i went for anxiety,  couldn't get any useful strategies or even help digging into root cause, your issues may be very different from mine, just stuff to think about.
