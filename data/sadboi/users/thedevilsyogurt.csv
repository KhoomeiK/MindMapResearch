No sugar coating,  no sparing of feelings. If he has any questions, which he likely will, just answer them with full and complete honesty.

I’ve spent the last 7 years of my life going to therapy and trying different meds to keep it under control, seven years of this and I still haven’t found one that works for me. I’m also a recovering meth/heroin addict so I just sort of have more problems than solutions lately. I try my best to be a caring,loving mother. I try so hard. But my kid sometimes throws these wild tantrums, probably more akin to meltdowns. He also does wild shit like open my oven door, stand on it to get to my knife block and gets the kitchen scissors out to try to open a popsicle..... he’s super smart and super sneaky, and also super determined to get what he wants. So as you can likely imagine, there have been a few incidents where I’ve lost my shit, slapped him across the face and all. These are very seldom, I’m talking like a total of 4 times.

I know how hard it is to have your child calling out to you while you can barely get out of bed. I’ve been in the midst of a mildly fluctuating depressive episode for nearly a year now.  Children at this age( mines 4 too) are still so incredibly needy. I honestly feel like the worst mother in the world day in and day out bc the only time I can get out of bed is to go to work bc I have to bc if I don’t go to work then we’re gonna end up homeless and starving.  He calls for mommy all day and sometimes I just can’t bring myself to answer. I sleep too much, eat too little, and spend not nearly enough time with him. But one thing you can do is set a small goal, in regards to your daughter. Something that is not really a big deal, something that you know you’ll be able to achieve.  Like, set a timer for fifteen minutes and go and play with her for that fifteen minutes. Or plan to try a nice new hairstyle for her one day a week. It may seem like things that small should be simple tasks for anybody to complete, the truth is, these depressive episodes really take it outta ya and half the time you’re lucky if you can keep some semblance of a routine, or self care habits.

Esp the part about not having to ask not to get cheated on, no scratch that, I especially agree with the whole thing. I got cheated on before, during, and after pregnancy. Somehow after it felt worse. Like a mixture of, “ we have our own little family now, how could you do this !?” As well as newfound insecurity about my body postpartum. It sucked big time being cheated on through all of that.  I remember shortly after giving birth I had joked with him that I would wait the full 6 weeks after giving birth to have sex, and his reaction was blatantly upset, and like incredulous. One of those hindsight warnings signs of what was really going on. The very worst was about one month after having our son, an old, good friend contacts me. She is apologizing profusely and I’m just trying to figure out what the hell she’s talking about. Next msg from her is a long screenshot, turns out it’s my sons father the night before, telling her how perfect she is, how much he wants her, and even that he would choose her over me.

AskReddit,fm56by7,t3_fsy0kx,1585767134.0,"I spoke to my friends and my parents, who I did not live with, in my head all day, everyday. It was so easy because everybody was reading my lines. But conversation in person was much more difficult because they were speaking for themselves for once. This made the lonesomeness grow deeper as I withdrew even more."

bipolar,fk37r15,t3_fg81rt,1583820857.0,"I don’t know if there is a documented relationship between the first two. But I can say from my own experience, there is definitely a link from memory loss to either bipolar depression or the meds I take. Either way, I can hardly remember anything anymore. Wish I had some advice for you or even the ability to say it will get better, but at the moment I don’t have either."

SingleParents,fj85d3m,t3_fbx5lr,1583105508.0,"I’m not a single mother anymore but my husband is a stay at home parent to our son. I make on dollar above minimum wage, but even when I was making min wage I was also told that I make too much to qualify for assistance. I understand how hard it is to make it by, and also the physical and mental exhaustion, as well as the pain of spending so much time away from your son.  I don’t really have any advice for you, I guess I just wanted to say that you’re not alone in any way shape, or form. You will get through this and things will be hard for awhile. But you’re strong enough to make it through. I hope things start to look up for you and and your boy soon."

bipolar,fhpoj6f,t3_f0zx20,1581793095.0,"As a child, I was a loner. I had very few friends , I rarely left the house except to go to school or to occasionally hang out with a friend. I spent my time reading mostly. I would sometimes hear voices. I was hypersexual, yes as a child even. I had an awful attitude and managed to burn plenty of bridges."
bipolar,fhpo1g9,t3_f12lzq,1581792840.0,I quit abilify and cymbalta cold turkey a couple of months ago. It was awful. I became hostile towards my husband and a couple of my coworkers. I spent almost all of my time in bed being bitchy. I started drinking at work and driving home and smoking pot while also at work. It was reckless and dumb and not something I plan on doing a second time.

bipolar,fhp397h,t3_f31lq0,1581781021.0,"I always feel as though I’m being watched by someone, I don’t know who. I feel like at least one person in the room or area can hear my thoughts. And in occasionally hear voices and see figures and flashes of light from the corners of my eyes."
bipolar,fhp26i1,t3_f34ix1,1581780418.0,"Our stories are eerily similar. My mother and I are both bipolar. I was raised by my grandparents bc she’s an addict/alcoholic. She lives in Ohio and I’m in California. Basically, she’s unmedicated, does not receive therapy and she calls me a few times a year when she’s drunk crying and telling me she’s got her gun in her hand and she’s going to kill herself. The first few times I flipped out and called all of her friends to check on her and even called the local police. Nobody showed up. It used to eat me away bc I felt like it was my responsibility to save her. But at the end of the day whose the parent and whose the child ? And at the end of the day, the only person that can truly save her, is her.  Now I’m not saying it doesn’t bother me or scare me anymore, but what I am saying is that I know now that the only thing I can do is try to talk her through it and reassure her that she’s loved and that she can have a good life if she gets the proper treatment. I miss her and I love her so much but I can’t be my moms mom anymore."

bipolar,fhp07zr,t3_f37pts,1581779271.0,"Bipolar drug addict here. I’d say stay away from meth,especially shooting it up. It’s basically chemically induced bipolar, with the high being very similar to mania and the comedown being very similar to depressive episodes. Also, it dehydrates you and increases your heart rate drastically, to the point that, with some medications, can cause heart attack."

To my family, my friends, my coworkers and even my therapist and psychiatrist as well as my care team. I feel like all I do is let people down and disappoint everybody. I started school recently as well and I’m not doing well in it at all. I wish I could do or say not to help you, but all I’ve got is that age old “ you’re not alone “. And it’s true, you are not. I, and many others, are right there with ya. Hope you start feel better soon, truly."

Currently on abilify and cymbalta, the rest of them were from the years I spent not knowing I was bipolar, and psychiatrist after psychiatrist kept Mis-diagnosing me, even after I had explained to all of them that the meds weren’t working. It was utter hell."
