ArmoryAndMachine2,fndxg6u,t3_g12k9t,1586879293.0,"I started this game a couple of weeks ago and was having fun, I enjoyed the mix between incremental and active gameplay.  Then the big nerf a couple of days ago hit and I was sad. Came to the reddit and was like, ""I'll give it time and see how it goes"" once I saw the updates.  Restarted the game since mine was broken, and hoping we would see either rollbacks or something based off the feedback to something closer to the build i started on.

At this point I'm going to uninstall and check back in a month or so, just seems the devs have a lot going on and theres going to be massive changes.  Given how they are requiring restarts after updates somewhat frequently, I'll wait till the dust settles and give it another chance, but if the start of the game is as painful as it is now, I'm out.  Which is sad because there is a lot of potential."

homeautomation,fkbidme,t1_fkbebyc,1584033552.0,"I've got two Schlage connect locks on my front and rear doors and about to add a third to my garage door.  

Pros are it easily integrates.  I had it in both my Vera setup and my current Home Assistant setup.  Programming codes is a breeze remotely, youncan add and remove them at will.  I have a text alert if anyone uses a code besides mine or my wifes so if someone else comes in I know.  
Cons are battery life can be an issue, so make sure it moves freely and doesnt bind otherwise your batteries will last a month instead of two years.  

I would highly recommend them, I've had mine in for almost 3 years and they've worked flawlessly."

 I had something sort of similar happen to me.  I was a freshman in college, had a girlfriend back home.   This junior decides she wants me.  Makes flirty comments, touches me a lot.  This goes on for a month.  She knows I have a girlfriend back home, I've told her no many times. Finally one night a group of us in the theater department were drinking.  She was an RA and says she will take me back and put me to bed since I was tired and done drinking for the night.  She says she needs to stop by her room.  We go on there she closes and locks the door, pushes me on the bed and says I'm going to f--- you, then starts making out with me.  Me, room spinning and about to pass out but not wanting to get physical with a woman, say no multiple times, she keeps kissing on me.  Next thing I know I'm naked, and we are having sex.  I felt so guilty but due to a sheltered upbringing I told myself that I must have wanted it and gave in, because ""guys always want sex so it's got to be my fault"" 
After that I broke it off with the girlfriend back home and dated the girl who raped me for the rest of the year before she dumped me for a new freshman the next year.  Took me 15 years to admit ti myself that I wasn't just uncomfortable about it but I was assaulted.  Another 5 years to admit to myself I got raped.  I'm ok with it now after therapy, but it screwed me up for a long time."

IAmA,f1c2wve,t1_f1bqt1u,1569348690.0,"“Like all parents im proud of my child, she didnt breathe on this earth but im proud of her and love her unconditionally.”

I think that is something that many people miss. My son is real, and even though he was stillborn, for seventeen weeks he was a part of my life. I had the joy (and pain) of holding him after my wife delivered.  I got to hold his hand, touch his face, kiss him and tell him I loved him. I still love him. I think a lot of people want to dismiss loss and grief, and miss that aspect. Up until two weeks ago I was the same way."
IAmA,f1c2kn8,t1_f1bt1ry,1569348473.0,"From my perspective as a father who lost his son at 17 weeks just two weeks ago, not well. 

My wife’s sister is a midwife, and was quite adept at helping her. Even got her a little stuffed lamb weighted to be the same weight as our son to hold. She also got my wife a beautiful necklace with a place to store a bit of our sons ashes when we get him back from the crematorium. When they presented it to her at dinner and I started crying, we made eye contact and in her ten year career I don’t think she had ever connected with a mans grief before then. To her credit, she apologized that they didn’t get anything to me, and in a later conversation she said she will be handling things for men better in the future in her professional capacity. I think most people focus on the loss of the birth parent and combine that with most partners being men and society’s general treatment of male emotions/vulnerability, it creates a space for the non birthing partner to get forgotten about."
IAmA,f1c0w4l,t1_f1bq7ph,1569347383.0,"My wife and I lost our son to a miscarriage at 17 weeks. One thing I have found tha makes a big difference for me is in phrasing. 

People who say “What can I do to help?” annoy the hell out of me. It makes me think and puts the onus of giving an immediate answer. The people who say “if you need anything, I am here for you when and where you need it” however is much easier to receive. The one thing I want (my son) no one can give me, but phrasing it like that lets me have my space without putting an obligation on me in that moment. 

In my experience there really isn’t a right thing to say. Two weeks ago, I had no clue what to say. Two weeks after it happened, I still don’t know. But people who give me space to talk at my pace, let me laugh when I need to laugh and let me cry when I need to cry have been the best."
IAmA,f1bzw59,t3_d8oc56,1569346737.0,"My wife and I lost our son at 17 weeks on 9/11 this year. As if that day wasn’t shitty enough as it is already. 

My experience is that most people are wonderful about being supportive of her, she has multiple people checking in on her, reaching out to her, providing emotional support, and the like. Everyone’s interactions with me, however, are along the lines of “you’re doing so great being there for her through this” with only two people reaching out to me specifically about me and my emotions in this process. Everyone else that has reached out has asked about her only (90%) or asking about me was an afterthought (10%) or at the end of the conversation with “you’re doing ok, right?”

We’re your experiences similar, and were you able to find resources specifically for the partner of the birth parent?  Most of the things I am finding are geared towards the woman’s experience and the challenges that the birth parent faces, with very little help available for the partners. Also if you have links to resources on the national (US) or state/local (Texas/Dallas area) levels, that would be very helpful. 

I have found that my two close female friends have been wonderful when I opened up to them, and yoga has been great in letting emotions out.  I’m doing ok, but we’ve been out of state with her family and are headed back home now. I’m concerned about dealing with things when I go back to work and through the coming weeks and months."
