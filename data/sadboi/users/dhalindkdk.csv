Joining a gym might really help and don’t get discouraged seriously ...observe other people...see what they are doing..do a little research and just take your time ..half hour here and there to an hour and so on and so on doesn’t matter how hard you work out in the beginning it’s just practicing getting there. I truly believe this will help in so many ways. Just being physically healthy as you can be. Talking to people is good too don’t ever feel like you don’t have someone to talk to :) many people here and I’ll be here always as well ! No judgement here. Believe me. I mean absolutely no judgement. ❤️

They get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of every day life. Hang on to hope because as you grow you will grow and learn new things. It does get easier I promise you this. It has taken me a long time to realize life is full of ups and downs and the downs are inevitable they will always be there. Trust me when I say this... try doing things for yourself when it comes to your health. How old are you ? (Just wondering ) if you can make regular work outs a part of your routine I promise it will help. Not saying it will solve everything but wake up every day, look in the mirror and tell yourself how awesome you are. Seriously try it, talk to yourself every day about all your positives. It might seem like nothing st first but keep doing it no matter how weird it feels at first. If you can take regular walks/light jogs. Can you join a local gym? Take steps into making these things a part of your life and make sure you’re eating right as elk. Wake up have breakfast and get your day started right. Eat for fuel. I’m tellin ya if you can make good habits as a young one it’ll help in the long run. Sorry I may have not worded all this clearly ...I’m just waking up and basically typing with one eye open. Lol. Focus on the positives. I feel like often times we allow ourselves to drown in our negative feelings but try hard to get out of that."
