schizophrenia,flmpsks,t3_fprboz,1585291713.0,It sucks I can't go to the park to clear my mind like I used to. Too paranoid
ptsd,fkwocqj,t3_fl42be,1584599182.0,Breathing exercises have worked somewhat for me. Make sure the exhale is as long as the inhale. Also calming music maybe?
derealization,fkwm3q4,t1_fkwhnbr,1584596880.0,"Completely understand. Other people in the household tell me I'm the most quite person they've ever met, I'm closed off, I don't like to communicate even though I do. Which just makes me more and more anxious to be around those people and feel disconnected from them. I live with people that are a large bit older than me so we don't have much in common. I don't really know what we'd have to talk about. It's hard not to take those accusations as personal attacks and disassociate when I'm so used to unstable living conditions. I wish I could tell them that."
derealization,fkwlnlg,t1_fkwht0u,1584596435.0,This is great advice. Thank you
schizophrenia,fkttyci,t1_fktlp1x,1584534496.0,"I'm not about to get into a debate with you about how someone who's only interaction with mental illness is making memes on reddit with words they don't know the true meaning of. That would be gaslighting myself.
Yes it's totally also gaslighting by you're logic for a rape survivor to feel like their pain is so much worse than someone who's greatest life hurtles are so mundane they probably themselves won't end up thinking about for more time than it takes to make the meme.
True trauma haunts you. I've made jokes about things that bother me. I've never said that someone with true pain can't do that, but don't act like the majority of people who makes these jokes have any understanding or true empathy for someone with an uncontrollable disease.
I didn't make this post to get validation. I have very few posts on this site for the years I've had an account. I made this post because I think what you said was harmful"
schizophrenia,fksvla3,t1_fkapvmh,1584499426.0,"NO THEIR NOT LOL. Making memes about how your version of ""depression"" is I'm sad today cause my friend didnt respond to my texts is not equal to someone with psychotic disorders or ptsd. Stop gaslighting people
Their pain isn't valid. It's a way to gain social validation and attention"
schizophrenia,fksv5x7,t3_fk8kwf,1584499139.0,"A great realization I've come to is that no human really cares enough about another to fully hate them unless they've been caused physical harm.
