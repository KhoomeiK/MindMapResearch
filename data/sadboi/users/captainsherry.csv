witchcraft,fj7ro8t,t1_fj62nf7,1583096804.0,"It will continue to bother him until he confronts this issue instead of avoiding it. This is not about you - it is about how your boyfriend feels he is not worthy of love or is unlovable. This has roots in his childhood upbringing when someone made him feel worthless. Without healing, it will get worse until he is unable to leave you alone at all and monitors your every movement. He must investigate his own soul."
witchcraft,fj614ab,t3_fbpuwt,1583051582.0,"This is a problem of your boyfriend's insecurity, so talking through why he feels threatened by the thought of you walking out could really help him, more than just happy dreams. Dreams must be worked through as they are the messages from our subconscious that there is a problem."
movies,fctb8ln,t3_e48wyl,1577937908.0,"Was Benoit Blanc lying when he said he knew Marta was involved from the beginning? Otherwise, why would he have let her take the CCTV video with her, allowing her the opportunity to wipe it as she went and why wouldn't he have stayed glued to her side when they were going back to the house - she had time to walk in the footprints she laid down the night before and then walk back in them, pretending she didn't hear him call out to her to stop where she was? He proved he was a competent detective at the end by outing the killer but was he not so alert in the beginning/middle?"
books,fbhjw7s,t3_cnvuby,1576875410.0,"Authors who think they should have 'realistic' endings to their stories are just lazy or unimaginative writers to me. We do NOT read for realism but for escapism, to escape a depressing world reality for a while. We don't want to read about it too. Besides, this ending was NOT realistic - any normal person would have sent the child's letter on to the police or the good lawyer, rather than meekly accepting a (possibly life) jail sentence. A five year old would never be convicted - that is real life. I hope that all authors don't get into the nasty habit of leaving open-ended conclusions to their novels like this. Readers want to KNOW what happens to the characters."
SuicideWatch,fb9jb3t,t3_e8gjky,1576640105.0,"It sounds like you were targeted. But don't let that become YOUR problem. The only people in the wrong here are your attackers and believe me, they have some super-bad karma coming to them. If it helps, think of your old self with sympathy and kindness, but understand that, after that horrible day, you became a different person - better, stronger, wiser, more empathetic to the sufferings of others because of what you went through. You are tough, a real man - buy yourself a trophy or a medal and look at it every day to remind yourself you went through hell but survived it!!!! You are a genuine hero. Look back at the old person you were and be glad of who you are now. You have come through the worst that life can throw at you. Everything is up from here once you have reached rock bottom. Think of yourself as a soldier having been through a war - be easy on yourself and don't in any way blame yourself for what happened. You are a veteran. It may be a blessing in a way that your girlfriend left - now you have the chance to start over as the new person you now are, with no one from the past to take you back to that past. You have paid your dues - now you are in for some wonderful times, the worst is over! Make your new life the best it can be - you deserve it."

minimalism,ev8imdo,t3_ce5ydn,1564280705.0,Money is not 'the bad guy'. Money is neutral - it's what we do with it that really matters. We can either live for ourselves or help out others and the planet from time to time.
