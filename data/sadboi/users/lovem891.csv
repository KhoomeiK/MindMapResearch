AmItheAsshole,fr1nvtd,t3_gm4bct,1589822965.0,"NTA. I felt the same way when I was your age, our moms sound like the same person. I don’t think youre wrong for saying what you said.

toddlers,fqyf7qe,t3_gljic3,1589747618.0,"If you haven’t already, read the whole brain child. It’s been helping me deal with my toddlers tantrums lately. Remember that even if it seems silly and annoying to you, his feelings are very real to him. I would just say something like, “I know you want to play with mommy’s phone, mommy’s phone is so fun. But we can’t play with mommy’s phone right now because (reason). How about we play with (other toy) instead?” Or if it’s bedtime tell him he can play with it when he wakes up in the morning. The most annoying part of this is basically having to repeat myself until it’s resolved. Sometimes he’ll move on right away when I make a suggestion but other times he just really gets stuck and we have to talk about it more. 

If you don’t want him to play with your phone at all anymore it’ll probably take some time for him to adjust. 

If he’s still mad validate those feelings again. It’s really hard (and sometimes annoying ngl) to deal with the tantrums, but it’s important for kids to know they can safely express their difficult feelings with you. If the feelings aren’t dealt with they keep coming up. Hope this helps"

He had not turned abusive although I did see that possibility and I just needed to leave before it got to that point.

AmItheAsshole,fqvencz,t3_gl4cb5,1589675656.0,That’s really poor customer service on their part to not tell you about the additional charge until your services were completed so they’re assholes for that part. However I do understand why the stylist would charge extra if you have very thick hair. I used to work at a salon and it wasn’t uncommon to add a small additional charge for that because of the extra time it took. But guests should always be made aware before their appointment. But since they told you at your last appointment that going forward it will cost extra if you go in to get your hair done and dispute the charges anyway you’d kind of be TA. Maybe ask to speak to the manager about it when you call to make another appointment.
emotionalneglect,fqc16ot,t3_gh5n20,1589248000.0,I dread Mother’s Day every year because my mom uses it as an opportunity to rant about how nobody appreciates her & no one does anything for her and how horrible my dad is because he doesn’t plan anything (tbf he does drop the ball every year).

I just have to keep reminding myself that this is not how parenting was meant to be, it makes sense that I can’t be my best mom self with the current state of things. It’s hard as fuck!

My dad and I have the same relationship that you described with your father. I wish I was closer with my parents and able to talk to them about my life, but I don’t see that happening. I just have to make my peace w the fact that they are not people I can rely on for emotional support. And it’s not my fault."

AttachmentParenting,fq3deme,t1_fq3boo2,1589065340.0,Yea I really had to let go of my screen time limits. Sometimes he watches his show in my phone in the morning so I can get an extra 20 minutes of sleep. It’s hard not to feel guilty Bc I feel like I should be playing with him more and stuff but I just want to hide from him all day 😭
AttachmentParenting,fq3cqtc,t1_fq3b1et,1589065157.0,"I just get fed up with the whining and tantrums and it’s hard to validate him and be a calm presence for him when I’m barely holding it together myself. Or when he does something “wrong” I’ve just been yelling a lot more. Like I have no more patience and I feel horrible. talking to him and interacting with him just feels like a chore. I know that’s horrible to say about my child but it really does feel like that. It’s just me all fucking day. 

That’s not really an option right now my family is dealing with two big losses and so I just can’t really ask for help right now. I live with my parents and they have their own stuff going on so even though they’re here they aren’t like helping in a hands on way, which is fair this has been hard on everyone. 

Right now we barely have a schedule anymore but he’s been watching tv wayyy more so I can get some space. I started out this lockdown pretty great lol, but at this point I’m way too drained  and I’m doing the bare minimum.

It’s possible if he’s not falling asleep until 12 that he may be so overtired that he can’t go to sleep at night. Maybe he needs an earlier bedtime? Kids need 10-12 hours of sleep until they’re like 5 or 6 I think. My son had the same issue and when he gets overtired he also wakes up more at night. It was really the worst so I completely feel your pain. I couldn’t really do anything because he’d fall asleep late and wake up every 30 minutes to an hour. But now that he’s on a more strict routine in regards to sleep he does a lot better.

AskWomen,fmggcpe,t3_fugfua,1586048421.0,"I had dreamed of being a fashion designer in middle school. I started sewing and making clothes for myself. My goal was to continue practicing sewing and studying the fashion world however I could, and after graduating high school I would go to FIT. I became really depressed before going to high school, I stopped sewing and stopped doing all the things I cared about. I suffered mentally all through high school. I developed an eating disorder so my mom didn’t let my read fashion magazines anymore. I ended up barely graduating high school and going to community college on and off for a few years after.

I took a fashion class a few years ago that reignited that passion. I made a bag out of an old pair of jeans for one of our projects. After finishing the class, I started making a dress just for fun. I don’t remember why but I stopped again though to be honest. It was four years ago and a really difficult time in my life. I just gave it up. Now I’m 23, a single mom and I’m finishing school. I don’t think I will ever accomplish my dream. I try to forget about it but it really is a passion of mine and I just grieve over the fact that I can’t do it, it’s almost like I lost a friend. I love to create art, I love to write, but nothing has my heart the way fashion design does. I plan on becoming an art therapist. I may start sewing again on the side when I have time. While I love my life now I am really sad at the way some of it turned out. I really wish I had the mind to not give up on my dream back then."

TrueOffMyChest,fmae82q,t3_fu237z,1585891289.0,Nothing here really seems bad except for the age difference. Of course this could be a way to gain your trust in order to manipulate/use you later. So just be careful. It’s only a three year age difference but there’s a pretty big difference mentally & emotionally between age 16 and 19. So just keep your guard up and try not to allow yourself to be swayed by his flattery and sweet gestures. Even if it is innocent if you find yourself worrying too much about if he’s grooming you or not it’s probably just best to end things.

I want to recommend that you check out Jennifer Michelle greenberg on Twitter and the articles she has written about her childhood abuse. She also wrote a book about it and how God got her through it, it’s called Not Forsaken. She is not one of those people who just throws a bible verse at you and expects you to be okay. She’s been a great resource and help to me, I hope she will be to you as well.

AskWomen,fdtmvdt,t3_en0xp8,1578719070.0,"Lately I’ve been extremely exhausted and depressed, just generally feeling shitty and hopeless. I still carry on and take care of my son, cook, clean, go to work, etc. Some days it’s just the bare minimum. But I make myself do it. I still don’t really consider it resilient bc I’m just doing what I have to do, it doesn’t feel like I’m doing enough but it’s more than I would’ve been able to do five years ago."
dating,fdfg1lg,t1_fdevkas,1578360848.0,You should probably tell them pretty early on. I’d be really hurt if I’d gone on multiple dates with a guy and really liked him only to find out he was never looking for a relationship. It’s an awkward conversation but at least they’ll know your intentions
dating_advice,fdcu5f7,t3_ekogmt,1578284392.0,"If you set that boundary and they don’t respect it, then you should move on to someone who will. There’s nothing wrong with not wanting to do the hookup thing"
learntodraw,fcyd0mg,t3_ejgql0,1578078292.0,Stunning
dating_advice,fcwgblo,t1_fcwg4qd,1578024890.0,Thank you for your response. I’m calling him tonight and I’ll talk to him about it. I still have feelings for him and I told him but I think he might be a little apprehensive now.
AskWomen,fcu60s6,t3_eivdpx,1577973409.0,"My mom used to, I can check with her and ask if she remembers how she did it & what she used and update when I find out. She did stop though bc it was really time consuming"

AskWomen,fcopzep,t3_ei3f0z,1577838483.0,"Stopped hooking up because it felt so awful. It was progressive, the more I did it the worse I felt. I would never put myself through that again. As hard as it is, maybe that’s the best route for you if you can’t shake those feelings after"
UnsentLetters,fcj65y5,t3_eh8yvw,1577678236.0,You are so strong and I am proud of you. One day it won’t be a constant battle. Keep fighting
Christians,fc3wtlv,t1_fc2bzeh,1577400663.0,I was baptized two and a half years ago
dpdr,fc1jrt3,t3_efmhxn,1577320854.0,I took vyvanse and had a similar experience. I felt human again for the first time in a long long time. It was prescribed to me but I stopped taking it after I stopped going to school.
breastfeedingsupport,fbwy93f,t3_eeg7xt,1577162752.0,"It is so hard in the beginning. I wanted to quit so often. But my sons pedi told me if you can breastfeed for the first two months you can breastfeed for 20 years. And honestly after two months it did get so much easier and were now going on 16 months of breastfeeding. It sucks when no one around you is educated on breastfeeding or even attempts to support you. If you’re tired and you’re breastfeeding, how will you be any less tired when you’re up making bottles all night for the baby? Ugh just makes no sense. Ask those same people telling you to use formula if they can instead help you cook and clean and do laundry to ease your burden so you’re not as tired. Hang in there momma you’re doing a great thing for your LO. I promise it will get easier very soon!"
Christians,fbt8trh,t1_fbt804z,1577071466.0,"Thank you. It’s definitely hard not to feel like one, not sure how to fix that"
Christians,fbt8qhd,t1_fbt8akj,1577071393.0,"I know He does, it’s hard to understand. I’m just so dysfunctional I don’t know how to cope with that, I look at who I am and I feel hopeless. Thank you though, I appreciate it"
Christians,fbifh3v,t1_fbh84to,1576899481.0,"Thank you, please pray for me I feel like I’m drowning in it now and I’m just trying to cling to God. I feel like such a failure & keep thinking what’s the point but I don’t want to give up."
learntodraw,fbaxdpj,t3_ecclnn,1576688822.0,"This is beautiful. I think the eyes may be just a little too high, and a little too big/wide but other than that it’s really gorgeous"

Christians,fb7uzox,t1_fb6yu5h,1576599991.0,"Thank you. Reminded me of 2 Corinthians 10:5. “We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ,”"
Christians,fb7uta3,t1_fb6yt6i,1576599874.0,It’s hard to wrap my mind around God rejoicing over me. I don’t deserve it. Thank you
