I got help and was saved from suicide by the ppl around me noticing the differences in me. Maybe get the attention of your family/friends but not in an ‚Äúattention seeking‚Äù way. Just make it noticeable. Just a suggestion. Hope it gets better!

OCD,feuikcu,t1_feuhhxe,1579386847.0,I‚Äôm not sure when I see my psychiatrist next but I‚Äôll bring it up to her when I see her
OCD,feu9cgd,t1_feu6k0i,1579384392.0,"Ever since as far back as I can remember (preschool i would probably say) I‚Äôve had disturbing and very frightening intrusive thoughts(God is a vampire and wants to suck my blood. Jesus is a werewolf and wants to eat my corpse. Other things that went against Christianity that I didn‚Äôt want to think about bc I‚Äôm religious, Sexual visions about ppl I didn‚Äôt want that with and family. My mom coming up with sharp teeth and killing me. The fear that I would kill my family at night. The fear that I‚Äôm sexually attracted to children. The fear that I will push someone into the street in front of a car. The fear I‚Äôll attack my cat.) I would cry and complain about them to my mom and it scared her so she sent me to a therapist around first grade. I don‚Äôt remember much of the therapy except us playing board games(which I assume was the therapy since I was little? Idk) and it got slightly better as I‚Äôve aged (I‚Äôll be sixteen in March) but are still here. I also have always had these compulsive behaviors I always felt like I had to do either because if I didn‚Äôt it would cause great anxiety and couldn‚Äôt stop myself or because someone would die or go through a misfortunate event bc of me. (Some examples of this were lying in the middle of the floor of this big room in preschool. Turning doorknobs certain ways a certain number of times and always having to kiss pictures on magazines and stuff bc I thought if I didn‚Äôt the animal or person in it would die alone and be sad. I also would have to touch someone several times after touching them once. It‚Äôs a lot and kind of specific sorry."
