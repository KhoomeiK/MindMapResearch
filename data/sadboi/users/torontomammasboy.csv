AskReddit,fqai7e2,t3_ghmr3e,1589219496.0,"Ok, in my 20s I did a few good things that set me on the right path but a few things that didn't.  
There is so much good you can do your 20s but here is the biggest.
1) Experience living alone (unless you're already in a happy live-in relationship).
2) Then at some point live in a roommate situation so you can see what you like and don't like about sharing space and this will set you up for more success when you do move in with a partner.
3) speaking of partners, if you're with someone that is not for you and dragging you down and not allowing you the time and space for your career development, spiritual or self-care time, etc then get out because this will sap you of energy
4) try to stay out of debt, very challenging in these times but try
5) if you're on a really focused career path great but have 1 or 2 fall back skills so if ever you're between jobs or the company you work for goes belly-up you can get a job and fill your wallet quick
6) develop fitness habits, doesn't have to be a rigid gym routine, just the habit of walking whenever possible.
7) hopefully you have a BFF but develop and nurture a small group of very close friends"

ptsd,fphi9f7,t3_gddt0n,1588621755.0,"When thinking about this topic one of the things that helped me after I sought help is I realized that PTSD was only ONE thing about me.  It is all-consuming while getting help and occasionally get triggered then it's like right there.    I do not think that a person with PTSD and admitting it is weak but if it's all they talk about (outside a support group or other appropriate place) then it can be exhausting.   
For me, in disclosing or listening I find my sweet spot where I'm not over-sharing or over-caretaking if someone is sharing.  I ask myself ""is it relevant to this moment?""  ""will this chat help me be better understood by this person or is this person trying to share something that would help me understand them better?"".   We all cope differently.   I decided to dive in and get help, a couple of times because I wanted to have the most fulfilling life I could.  I still have PTSD and it still affects me but not all the time and there is more I CAN do than not.

Some of these groups that are anti-lockdown are not listening to the science.  Also, they are putting everyone at risk.
As a trans person my biggest fear is being hospitalized at the best of times, let alone for covid as I would not be able to have my wife, my best friend or an ally there to speak up for me in case my trans-ness doesn't get me the quality care etc.
I didn't always walk with fear before the pandemic but with rising levels of hate groups floating around the world was feeling unsafer for me just before than say 5 years ago or so.  
I just want this disease to go away.  Until it does, I'm planning on following the rules and just staying home as much as possible.
I do follow where these groups are gathering as to make sure when i go for groceries or a walk I'm nowhere near them.

Here in Toronto, just the other day they gathered at Queen's Park which is literally a 5 minute walk within half dozen hospitals which means they shared the sidewalk and the subway with healthcare workers that are trying to save lives.  Makes me sick.

When you are dating and don't live with the person you tend to have sex a lot because it's all new but also because if all you have is the weekend.  So when you move in together it seems like you're having less sex but is not true. It's just you're with them all the time and who has the energy to have sex every single day.  My wife and I have been married almost 3 years and dated for 2 so almost 5 years and we are not young but we have sex more than once a week.  We have our ebbs and flows.

However, while I understand how you feel if your person says he loves you and he isn't abusive take it at face value.
It's weird, watching porn with a casual partner is different than a life partner because the goal is to add another element or expedite desire.  With a casual who cares what they are thinking about but when you see your love getting hot with another body type it's complicated. You're happy that they are having fun but too busy over thinking to enjoy the moment.
Also, and I hate to bring it up but during this difficult time in the world we have to much time to think and focus on everything negative.   Can't get enough air, exercise, and other self care stuff that feeds our own self esteem.

I view this as a medical condition that I started to have treated about 20 years ago.   I'm not stealth.   I was more out in the beginning and more out in recent years, was more low profile for a good few years.  The whole 'social construct' thing for me is WHAT kind of guy I am, and yes, I don't play into traditional stereotypical male roles...i cook, clean, like puppies etc. 
My pronouns, once I transitioned were non-negotiable.
Also, I'm not sure if this is how you feel but you sort of alluded to it is that this whole thing is only PART of you.  I'm also not happy with were the community is going in some ways, I feel there is a transsexual erasure and that bugs me.
That said, for other people and other identities I will be respectful but yes, I have a group of transitioned (surgery doesn't matter) people who are transsexual going either direction that we hang with and sometimes discuss this stuff and sometimes do other activities.

My first love broke up with me, she needed to find herself and go on a journey, so did I so like you, i let her go but we remained friends for decades, we dated other people.   I assumed she was happy and she assumed I was happy.   As friends we continued on comforting each other when the chips were down and celebrating our milestones.  Some years I hardly saw her and some years regularly.    Almost 6 years ago, she gave me this hug, different from our purely platonic hugs that I enjoyed for decades.  I couldn't stop thinking about it and I was at the tail end of a bad relationship and other stupid things happening in my life.  Finally, about a year after ""the hug"" I asked her out.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I couldn't stop thinking about her.   We dated for a good full year to just make sure it was real, then I proposed as I couldn't let her get away again.  We are going to be celebrating our 3rd anniversary in a few months.

We had to break up.  We had to find ourselves, it was necessary at the time.   But we could have gotten back together years before we did.   But hey, we had our friendship and that is precious.  
But I got the one that almost got away!!!!

Now, this may or may not happen to you, but without being creepy just stay her friend.   Maybe time out for now till you don't feel so raw.   Just keep in touch with her.

What isn't spoken about openly in my circle of friends and people I care about is the stuff this brings up for them.   So I can speak for me.

Another thing coming up for me is anger at the people that hurt me in the past, some are no longer in my life and some are.   And I'm vividly thinking about how they hurt me, the loneliness and despair I felt at other stages of my life.   So for me, I just remember I'm not there anymore but I can't always pull myself out of it right now.   I think about what life would be like if I was trapped with them right now.

We have now been married 2.5 years so almost 5 years back together total.  So grateful.  I wish we didn't wait that long but we have now and almost 5 years under our belt.   So, my point is you might have to wait a little while to see how serious his new relationship is and if it lasts.   If they break up, be a good friend and give him space to heal then pounce!  Sounds like he is your soul mate.   For now, if it doesen't cause you much grief see if you can be in his life."

AskReddit,fj1z6gh,t3_fb0e9s,1582931078.0,"I was in a horrible relationship with a person that threatened to kill themselves if I ever said I wanted to leave.  Take note that I told this person from the start that I didn't see forever in their eyes but I'll be a good partner while it was going well and a great friend after.  They agreed to those terms.   I was miserable.   Anyway, 5 years ago I got out and a little while later rekindled a flame with my first love that I remained friends with.   I couldn't let her get away again so I proposed and we have been happily married for just over 2.5 years and I love waking up and I sleep better than I ever have!"

I only bit the bait once and regretted it.  Very annoyed with this trend."

I think the virus is going to spread in some areas and I hope people get better soon, however, I am worried about people so much focus on this that they don't protect themselves from the regular seasonal influenza that sickens many and many people die from that."

My wife and I do this with just the 2 of us or attend or host mini game nights and it's truly a wonderful way to spend time with friends or neighbours.
