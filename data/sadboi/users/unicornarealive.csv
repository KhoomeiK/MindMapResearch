EatingDisorders,foqpwie,t1_foqceta,1587998650.0,"Not OP but my therapist said the same. My trigger moment was my mother telling my i got fat (gained a bunch of weight during my gap year.). I felt like i wasn't worth my mother's affection anymore. I wanted to be and look perfect for her. Growing up she would often compliment me on my body. Now that was gone. Since she was constantly dieting and worried about her own weight, being thin has always been important to her.
  
Also growing up my mum struggled with (postpartum) depression and was quite overwhelmed with raising me. Since my dad worked a lot I would spend a lot of time by myself (I'm an only child). I remember feeling lonely and sort of empty since I can think, even though I had plenty of friends in school or in the neighborhood. We never really had a healthy routine/structure at home. I had to play mostly by myself, she couldn't really help me with school, she rarely tried to teach me new skills.
  
My bulimia was something that was always there for me. I love my mom, she's the person I trust most. She tried her best, she loves me and genuinely tried to help me with my ED. But during recovery she would also put a lot of pressure on me and had certain expectations I couldn't fulfill. I think I grew up without my mum being attuned to me and my needs. She hasn't always been a source of comfort when I was stressed or hurt. I never learned how to cope or self-regulate in a healthy matter."

Professions dominated by women sometimes pay less than others dominated by men. Men are still the majority in well-paid management positions. We rose up to demand for equal pay a and to attack lingering discrimination, harassment. Switzerland still offers no paternity leave and limited access to expensive daycare is seen as a major hindrance to women's integration into the labour market.

The strike has mobilized a sense of solidarity. Tons of actions where held major cities and towns: Women filled squares and streets in front of government buildings, people gathered for massive strike breakfast or lunch celebrations, blocked traffic, sang songs, fought for their rights. In Zurich where I striked,  I went to visit and talk to female asylum seekers, followed a huge clitoris cart through the city, had wonderful discussions with women of all walks of life, chanted and demonstrated with other (mostly) women calling for gender equality."

*- Does your healthcare system work?*

Since Switzerland is regarded as a wealthy and well functioning country, I'd say no. Too damn expensive. Quality and service are usually good tough. I just don't approve of the system.

*- What do you love/hate about Switzerland?*

Love: The quality of life, things work, hiking, safety, security and great education. And my friends are fucking cool.

Hate: People are so insular, too stressed, care too much about work, judge too fast and complain too  much.
