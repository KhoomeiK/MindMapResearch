BPD,fpjkw1m,t3_gdadnp,1588672355.0,"I do this all the time. I pick up a lot of different speech patterns from TV shows or people around me. For instance, lately I've been talking a lot like the hockey players do in Letterkenny ie ending a lot of sentences with ""buddy"" or something or other. I find it funny when I catch myself doing it now. It used to bother me and make me feel kind of fake but I've grown to accept it's a part of my personality that I don't particularly dislike"
leagueoflegends,fnai19b,t1_fnaghew,1586797860.0,Why?
leagueoflegends,fnai0o6,t1_fnagu96,1586797852.0,"He has an auto lockdown that you isn't able to be dodged what are you talking about. I'm not saying he doesn't take skill to play but kiting with him is not hard. It's a point and click lockdown. Also how is the glacial augment argument valid, any champion can take it and kite. Ahri being one of the most popular with it arguably. And her item build doesn't have anything to do with her design or literally every ADC is a bad champion by your standards lol. Quinn absolutely takes skill to play and is unique as a ranged champion."
leagueoflegends,fna5rgr,t1_fn9pjnd,1586791553.0,Calling Quinn cancer and having a Ryze flair is baffling to me. Ryze is so much worse imo. Talk about bad design. No other champion has such a lack of identity that they needed to be reworked 3+ times and still managed to be ass to play against.
BPD,fn99u55,t3_g0bn0z,1586764642.0,"For me it usually manifests as blacking out. It tends to happen when I'm incredibly stressed or upset. I start to feel tired or like my thoughts are lagged behind my actions. And then I usually ""wake up"" and have lost some amount of time. Happens mostly at work and when I wake up I usually have ended up doing a lot of stuff wrong and have to fix it without realizing I was the one that did anything wrong. (I work in a grocery store and stock shelves for context so I usually have to fix a few shelves). Before learning about BPD I told my coworkers that this happened and they said I had Narcolepsy (not even close) and that it would go away if I had a more consistent sleep schedule (not true). When it's not a full blown blackout I usually just feel like I have to think through intense fog and I sometimes have to tell myself to do stuff multiple times before I remember I have to do anything at all."
leagueoflegends,fn98gq7,t3_g07ufl,1586763164.0,"Nobody has said it yet so here I go. Quinn. Her entire aesthetic and design is wonderful in my opinion. She's both a good ranged fighter and an assassin depending on how you build her, she's got well defined strengths and weaknesses. All around a fun champion to play and only slightly frustrating to play against. Her mechanics aren't complex but I don't think that means she's too simple either."
leagueoflegends,fmvsksw,t1_fmvq7gw,1586429296.0,"This. I had someone say the other day I shouldn't play my best champ (Quinn) in normals because I had 100k mastery points and I should take her into ranked. I don't much care for ranked games and I definitely feel like people care more in normals. Note that the person complaining was on the enemy team so idk if that was just salt but it was a silly complaint to be making imo. Let people play where they want and how they want, if they want to go hard in normals that's their way of having fun in a game where that's honestly hard sometimes."
leagueoflegends,fmqzdl3,t1_fmqslev,1586310367.0,Yeah I get what you mean but I feel like she's one of the only mobile marksmen in the game right now and with Riots current champ outlooks I'd rather they not touch her tbh. She fits really well as both assassin and adv and I'd rather they not try to force her into one of those roles. I do think she could use a few tweaks but her kit isn't in need of a total change up like the two you mentioned
leagueoflegends,fmqrf45,t1_fmqq03w,1586305445.0,Eh to each their own I guess then. I think she's fine rn and has a niche but isn't in a bad spot. There are way more champs that need TLC than her imo
leagueoflegends,fmqmo7p,t1_fmowhhm,1586302641.0,I'd die for PROJECT Quinn. Valor could be a cool ass drone carrying her around. She could easily fit the theme. Also Dragon Trainer could be an amazing legendary for her
leagueoflegends,fmqmeh2,t3_fwk3r9,1586302486.0,Umm so not one Quinn mention. Dragon Trainer Quinn or PROJECT Quinn would be amazing. Why does nobody remember the bird queen.
DnDGreentext,flvfmf8,t1_fluaqur,1585522783.0,"Both of those movies were so good imo. Not ""good"" good but solidly entertaining. Van Helsing has some of my favorite movie werewolves to this date. No other movies werewolves look as badass. Definitely agree it should have leaned into the cheese a bit more and not tried to be so serious in some areas. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I feel had the perfect amount of cheese and definitely knew it. It definitely tried to end on a note that could have lead to a second film but that would have ruined the magic in my opinion."
leagueoflegends,fkxjr02,t3_fkwr7n,1584629614.0,Fuck TSM-sama just became my transition goals...
BPD,fkjzsaf,t3_fioqmx,1584267304.0,Dr. Fox was my intro to BPD. After watching MedCircle and really identifying with the BPD symptoms I found him and he really made me feel understood and that I could work through this and I wasn't alone. He's honestly so great.
leagueoflegends,fee7zap,t1_fee49lp,1579028275.0,Yeah I saw that four armed champ design and wanted it immediately! A caster with an udyr like play style with the four arms would be cool.

Minecraft,fax309x,t3_eao1cf,1576378202.0,Please mark nsfw your nether region is completely exposed
BPD,fau97a7,t1_fatlesl,1576345870.0,Wow it's like someone picked the thoughts out of my head and wrote them down. This is exactly what my day to day is like. It's comforting knowing someone else gets it.
BPD,faqf0is,t3_ea9va5,1576302129.0,I'd actually really really like this. I already have the workbook lol but I can't keep myself consistent with it on my own so this would be awesome.
BPD,faib2p5,t1_fai8crw,1576103684.0,Absolutely. I've been trying to work on doing mindfulness meditation instead of giving in to cravings but that's also easier said than done lol
BPD,fahm7a6,t1_fahh0t2,1576088747.0,Yeah it's not something I want to do anymore but it's hard to kick. Alcohol was actually a lot easier to stop doing imo
BPD,fagmli6,t3_e92r6d,1576063171.0,I relate to this a ton. I honestly never feel like smoking cigarettes unless I've had a rough day at work and even then I can't justify it. But the minute my partner leaves the house I pull out my cigarettes and go to town. It feels so ridiculous but I also can't resist
BPD,fad8uxt,t3_e8htnl,1575959806.0,Omg I love Dr. Fox! He was my first real insight into BPD after finding it and realizing I might have it and he's so helpful and informative. Dr. Todd Grande also has a YouTube about mental health and stuff and his are well done.
BPD,f9a66oh,t1_f98vz5l,1575199158.0,Thank you so much. I'll definitely look into CBT for insomnia.
BPD,f90jx88,t3_e324jr,1574973352.0,I am thankful for this community. I come here often and read the DAE posts and it gives me a sense of hope. Hope that I'm not alone and hope that there are ways out there that can help.
BPD,f8rw1y7,t3_e1qlwp,1574755889.0,"Yes! I dread talking to people about topics sometimes because I worry about when they're gonna ask me ""Why?"" and then I'll flounder and feel dumb. It's awful."
BPD,f7mpq0s,t3_dwz9iw,1573870045.0,"Omg I get this. I hate if it when I'm cuddling with my SO and my brain is just telling me ""as soon as they get up it'll be your fault and you'll hate them for it"""
BPD,f7dzxl1,t1_f7dxsb5,1573639160.0,"Yeah it definitely does always seem endless but in my experience there's always a relief period. 

I'm glad I could help. Like I said, I try to start with a low effort game (think Stardew Valley or Minecraft) to get myself interested in stuff again"
BPD,f7dx38g,t3_dvoqeh,1573634435.0,"I get like this once in a while. It's one of the more depressing states to be stuck in imo because it feels like there's nothing to pull you out. I totally get what you mean about worrying whether the game will be fun or not. I worry about something frustrating me and then that subsequently worsening my already bad mood and then spiraling into something worse. 

I've found that just pushing through and trying at least one game, especially a non competitive one, helps even though it's really hard."
BPD,f6tli9g,t1_f6t8jov,1573150699.0,Ha that's fine! I already feel like I'm nuts half the time.
BPD,f6swllv,t3_dswwgp,1573140773.0,"You're already who I want you to be. An Austin Powers fan? Out of the blue? That's the best thing in the world and made my day! I relate to this so much and I feel your struggle. If you need someone to vent to you can DM me and I promise to reply ASAP. Don't ever feel alone, I got your back."
BPD,f602ywg,t1_f5zulyf,1572602697.0,"Oh man when I'm trying to listen to something, be it music or a movie/video and someone tries to talk to me I nearly lose it. Because I can't hear both at once or they both become garbled and I can't keep listening to what I wanted because I don't want that person to think I'm rude even if I think they are"
BPD,f5v604t,t3_dpcdpp,1572484180.0,I really think it's a diagnostic and societal bias when it comes to the gender disparity of BPD. I'm a male too and it also bothers me that most articles and lots of books even that talk about BPD just assume the reader is female. But I have heard and learned a lot about BPD from people that recognize that it's not as uneven as studies make it out to be.
BPD,f59gvde,t1_f59g0nz,1572088636.0,Oh absolutely. I don't understand those kind of people either. It seems like such a shallow thing to find attractive. Not to say that physically fit people aren't attractive and that finding that attractive is wrong but finding the toxic side of it attractive is weird to me.
BPD,f59copa,t3_dnazk7,1572083153.0,"I agree and disagree. I think society definitely puts a lot of pressure on guys (or even just the masculine person in the relationship imo) to be the one to ""win a girl (or boy) over"" and it's pretty unfair. I think it leads to a lot of one-sided relationships which lead to a lot of rejections and people end up getting this idea that they'll never be in a relationship. 

I disagree that girls have ""more options"" though. I think they're trapped in the same situation but in a different way. I don't want to speak for the whole gender but in my experience girls feel tons of relationship pressure but for them it comes as ""be a lady"" or ""no guy wants a girl that's stronger than him"" and that stuff can be just as damaging. 

And as a side note, I think relationships are always gonna be work. It's just easier when you're a team and no one person leaves everything to the other. Nobody that really wants to be in a relationship will make you work for it and you shouldn't feel like you have to work for someone's attention."
BPD,f4zbel5,t3_dm6y8r,1571902774.0,"I really appreciate this post especially after having a really hard day for what feels like no reason. 

I think one of my good qualities is I'm pretty funny. I don't think I'm a comedian or anything but I can do some pretty solid on the spot stuff and I love making people laugh with improv."

BPD,f1jqxg7,t1_f1bvk4j,1569526762.0,I do this all the time. It helps a lot when I get overwhelmed at work or after talking to someone that triggers an emotional spiral.
BPD,f1jqk6r,t1_f1j93x3,1569526617.0,This is one thing I have to remind myself of all the time. Even with my male friends (I'm a bi guy) and it gets frustrating sometimes.
BPD,f1jpjdu,t3_d9nwrn,1569526215.0,"Lsd, Shrooms, and Molly have all helped me gain insight into myself. Without them I don't know if I would have realized that the way I handle relationships is weird and helped me find out I have BPD. I don't think they're for everyone but with the right setting and the right people (I always trip either by myself or with my FP and maybe one additional person but never more than three) I think they can be majorly beneficial. They really helped me see my actions from the viewpoints of others."
BPD,f0jo08p,t3_d53itd,1568658805.0,24 and definitely struggling with this but I'm managing somehow
BPD,f0h3ngc,t1_f0ghb6r,1568612199.0,"Oh man I absolutely feel this. As a bisexual guy I just feel like I can't stop thinking about everyone as a potential sex partner even if I don't know them and they aren't even my type. I've thrown away a few relationships for shitty hookups or even just the possibility of more sex without the strings and stress a relationship has.

I also totally get what you mean about never believing your attractive despite what other people say and it's fueled my body image issues throughout my life and it's really screwed with my view of food in general. And the strangest part to me is that no matter how I feel I act like I've got all the confidence in the world because I know that's what people generally find attractive and want to have sex with. So no sexual encounters feel really genuine and just sorta depress me."
BPD,f071isk,t1_f06ud2s,1568450549.0,Is it okay if I dm you then?
BPD,f06u7ku,t3_d3yzqi,1568445877.0,Oh man yes I was thinking about this today too actually. I've noticed that I have this insane need to have sex and think about it all the time. But once I'm actually about to have sex or I'm in the middle of sex my thoughts go everywhere else. It's like I can't focus on sex unless I'm being denied it in a way. I'd definitely like to chat if you're up for it. This is a huge point of contention for me and my self confidence
BPD,eyyetrd,t3_cz4zs8,1567583443.0,DAE also have aphantasia or exist somewhere on that spectrum? Because I feel like it contributes a lot to my BPD symptoms. Not being able to imagine thing and people in my head makes it hard for me to remember they're all real and that they care for me.
BPD,eyvy051,t1_eyvfjrd,1567515474.0,Oh wow hi me I must have forgot I had two reddit accounts
relationship_advice,eyn8ya3,t1_eyl150n,1567236910.0,"I also have BPD (learned about it pretty recently) and I agree that while splitting is normal her behavior is not and is definitely not indicative of how all people with BPD act. 

From what I'm reading I can only assume her BPD was causing her to think that him getting healthy would make him leave her. Her thought process was probably something along the lines of ""well I'm unattractive (terrible sense of self is a bpd symptom) and so if he becomes more attractive he'll notice the disparagement and thus dump me for a more fitting partner"".

Now I can say for a fact I've felt like this in relationships (I'm a male if that matters) but never have I considered sabotaging my SO's efforts to better themselves. That's something she definitely needs to talk with her therapist about. I'm also sorry this happened to OP but I really want people to know that we aren't all like this."
BPD,ex64ge2,t3_crjj2w,1566038849.0,"I feel this exactly. Passively suicidal is how I describe it to myself and the one friend I can talk to about stuff like this and all my BPD symptoms. 

I always feel like death would be the release I desire from all the stress and anxiety of the constant emotional turmoil but like you said I'd never kill myself because it would devastate my family.

I would probably choose death over life if given the option (I am also not suicidal as I feel this is important to point out) and I can't remember being afraid of death itself, only the way in which I might die if that makes sense."
gaybrosgonemild,ew5h47q,t1_ew5gu19,1565136134.0,"Oh definitely! Robert Jordan is one of my favorite authors and Brandon finishes the series brilliantly. The Eye of the World is the first book of the series, most are on Amazon in sets (up to book 12 as I haven't found 13 and 14 in sets) and they aren't too pricey. A lot of people say the series gets slow-ish around the middle (9 and 10 mostly) but they were all great to me."
