pestcontrol,fqxg1s6,t1_fqxffuf,1589731731.0,"Of course anytime. Keep in mind though, this IS months later. Its fully possible and most likely that plugging the hole solved that entry way. But the mice found another way in. Some companies may give you some free service, but to be honest if you were one of my client's it would be another charge as its been so long. The reason for that being as i have no idea if you've done something to bring them back. You can do a lot of the work yourself and save hundreds of dollars. No house is secure from rodents, eventually they will find a way in. You just have to make it difficult enough for them to move on."
