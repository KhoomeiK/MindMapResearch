SuicideWatch,fqvmde4,t1_fqoq1c9,1589680339.0,"Nah, my father doesn’t really do the whole talking thing, especially when it comes to mental health. He’s also usually either drunk or seemingly annoyed by my presence, so I’ve been trying to stay away. I might try looking in to online therapists sometime soon, but I’ve also been considering just admitting myself inpatient to a local mental hospital. The only thing stopping me from doing that is my birthday next week. I really don’t want to spend my birthday alone in a psych ward."
QAnonCasualties,fqo40ea,t1_fqo3r2j,1589507111.0,"That’s not an option for me. I live with my parents, have no car, and have no friends to stay with. The only time I can be separated from her is when I’m at my boyfriend’s house, which is about one day out of the week. I already hardly leave my room anyway because the whole family is so damn dysfunctional, but whenever I do, I get trapped in these conversations"
QAnonCasualties,fqnyvyv,t1_fqny345,1589504144.0,"The thing is that it never *will* stop. Sex trafficking, pedophilia, any form of abuse will never be fully stopped and there’s undoubtedly so much happening that not even the most vigilant of people will ever know about it. Yes, it’s horrible, and no, it shouldn’t be swept under the rug, but not only will making yourself unable to communicate with lest it be about such subjects *not* do anything to help those in that situation, but it will also make everyone around you utterly miserable. It’s also funny to me that not nearly as many people (particularly the ones involved in this qanon conspiracy) even batted an eye to the reality and commonality of sex trafficking until it was tied by conspiracy theorists (whether legitimate or not) to politics and became something fun to gossip about while also practicing strict partisanship and encouraging further political biases. At this point for many of these people, it’s an agenda, not a protective motherly instinct."
QAnonCasualties,fqnvoct,t3_gjynf3,1589502319.0,"My dad is sort of a believer of all this QAnon business too, but the difference between him and my mother is that she is genuinely obsessed. Almost all of her day is dedicated to consuming media regarding Qanon and it’s all she can seem to talk about anymore. She even laughs like an unstable supervillain at some of the things she comes across and she loves to share, despite both my dad and I asking her to tone it down a little. I’ve asked her not to talk about it at all around me, which lasted about a week before she started doing it again. My mental health is nowhere near stable enough to deal with these types of conversations all day, everyday, or to deal with the issues it’s causing within the family. I keep hoping she’ll let it go after the pandemic dies down, but it seems less and less likely. Guess I’ll die :)

UPDATE: Apparently she’s an antivaxxer now, after once being extremely against antivaxxers. At this point, I’m afraid the new QAnon “drop” could say the moon doesn’t exist and she would genuinely believe it."

depression,fni6cqe,t3_g1xex1,1586974736.0,"I know that self harming probably sounds so, so pathetic to most of you. It sounds pathetic to me, too. I’ve seen what it has done to people and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. It scares me that it could become a habit again, but it releases me from something I otherwise can’t find a release from. When I hit myself, it usually doesn’t calm me down as much as when I cut myself. I think being able to see what I’ve done to myself is what helps me.

I’m so, so sorry if this post triggered anyone. I know it sounds rich coming from me right know, and I know it isn’t that easy, but please, don’t hurt yourself. Especially if you’ve gone so long without relapsing. It isn’t worth the temporary relief."
insaneparents,fn3p2qs,t1_fn2m66x,1586625141.0,"we always talk about the privilege and the audacity that celebrities have had during the pandemic, but have we considered all of the non celebrities who, instead of adhering to social distancing and quarantine, decide to spend their time spreading fake news about the coronavirus and continue to gather in large clusters of people, endangering so many other people because they believe themselves to be invincible? the privilege they have to refuse taking these precautions because they’re not on the front lines as hospital workers or grocers, they’re not immunocompromised, etc.? celebrities are always dumb and privileged, but these kinds of people are dangerously so."

insaneparents,fmg35vk,t3_fv2rli,1586040279.0,"I’m sorry. She’s truly awful. She’s acting like child and making the situation about herself despite the fact that you, her CHILD, tried to take your life. I can’t fathom how she’s so much more concerned with herself right now than with you and your well-being.

If you can arrange it, I would definitely try to move out. I know we often endlessly love our mothers no matter how awful they may be, but you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your health to live with her or even have a relationship with her. 

I wish you a quick recovery and good luck dealing with the situation once you’ve recovered. I’m sorry things got bad enough for this to have happened."

From what I’ve read, anxiety and explosive disorders are a common comorbidity, along with anger simply being an underlying symptom of anxiety. It’s weird how certain things affect me and others don’t, though.

I’ve always had issues with a wondering mind and realizing I’ve completely zoned out on whatever I was trying to do, but that never really bothered me. These thoughts however are terrible. I’m glad you’re at least seeing some improvements with your mental health. Hopefully I can figure something out with my insurance and potentially seek therapy after this whole virus situation blows over. Best of luck to you."

bipolar,flijzs3,t1_flifx0k,1585184164.0,"I would say my depressive moods and happy moods can last from a few weeks up to a few months, but I feel as if my depressive episodes are typically much longer than my happy ones. I definitely think I cycle between them quickly, which was one thing that had me confused when lightly researching bipolar disorders because the information typically describes these episodes of being very long and only cycling a few times in a year. That’s definitely not the case for me. I haven’t been able to pinpoint any specific triggers other than if something really upsetting occurs, it’ll probably send me into a depressive state or worsen my mood further if I’m already in one.

I don’t remember any of the medications I’ve taken sending me into mania. If anything, I feel like they all did quite the opposite and either made me more depressed or caused frequent mood swings.

I’m sorry to hear of your rocky past, but I’m glad you finally got the clarity and help you needed. I hope you’ve been able to find more stable ground and happiness so far."
