depression,fokc8iq,t3_g7soko,1587839365.0,I feel like this too. I kinda like being left alone and finally being able to not have to do groupwork or deal with the girls at my school. Although I almost had a panic attack yesterday when my friend put me on a group text with ALL of the girls in my grade and announced that she was going to do a Netflix watch party and that everyone was invited to join. I feel guilty because all the other girls seemed totally excited and I was trying my hardest to get out of it.
