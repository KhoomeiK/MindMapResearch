BorderlinePDisorder,fqdghsp,t3_gi94py,1589289150.0,Honestly had a break down yesterday and it got to a really dark place. What made me feel worse was I told my friends and I never want to feel like a burden to them. Ever.
AskGayMen,fqdgc4b,t3_ghb9sm,1589289050.0,I say find a middle ground like face time or discord and chat that way. It won‚Äôt feel the same as being with each other but it‚Äôs more important that you two are safe and in turn making sure everyone else remains safe as well. It‚Äôs great to want to be with each other every day but the current situation doesn‚Äôt really fit with that narrative at the moment.
AskGayMen,fqdg49f,t3_ghbe8p,1589288911.0,"Let it go. The back and forth with wanting to be together but only in secret, then to deny you in public (with a girlfriend mind you) and when you‚Äôre mad or upset, he turns around and begs for another chance. Don‚Äôt know you but I can tell you put your emotions out there and you honestly deserve someone who doesn‚Äôt Care that people will see you two together and doesn‚Äôt change his mind every five seconds about his sexuality. Go and be happy especially during times like these. You deserve that much."

PrettyLittleLiars,fmc48qr,t3_fubbr0,1585938608.0,"Honestly after Alison came back. I know it sucks but the mystery about the show disappeared when she returned. I liked the idea of them keeping Ali a hallucination for the girls whenever they were on the brink. It made you wonder if she really was dead or alive this whole time. Personally had they made it to where after the final A reveal, the girls are all leaving for college and meet up at the brew one last time or even the grille and as they‚Äôre sitting there eating and laughing, you see a blonde in a red coat and you think it‚Äôs A but it‚Äôs revealed to be Alison."
PrettyLittleLiars,flrmxyx,t3_fp71yx,1585423543.0,"I mean I figured it had to be CeCe when we first met her in Season 3. She was this mystery friend of Ali's that the girls never knew about but she knew so much about them already? And one slip she made was when she joked with Aria about wanting to do some ""free shopping"" (Shoplifting) at the boutique she was working at, Aria corrected her saying that it was Hanna who used to do shoplifting.  

This matches up with Mona saying she and CeCe talked in Radley."
PrettyLittleLiars,fld0gl7,t3_flwsoq,1585053135.0,"From a creative standpoint I could see it as them wanting Alison to become a better person especially after being on the run for almost 2 years and the trauma she dealt with but from a viewer standpoint it didn't make any sense. 

I think what made the show work for such a long time was the aura of Mystery behind Alison's ""death"". As viewers we wanted to know what happened to Alison and what was the motive behind A allegedly killing her. But the plot holes and endless loose ends didn't help."
PrettyLittleLiars,flczocb,t3_fnzpfu,1585052442.0,"To me it was a little bit too suspicious that Aria got very little torture from A. I mean yeah Byron's cheating came to light and Ezria was almost fully exposed but other than that Aria had very little to lose. Spencer, Hanna and Emily probably had a much bigger share of A's games. It was almost like A was trying to figure out which of the three they were going to torture that day."
AskGayMen,fl3idvn,t3_fmbklj,1584785397.0,All I can really say is good luck but I would definitely sit down and understand what this means and what happens afterwards. You have to be okay with whatever his response is and with whatever happens after the fact.
AskGayMen,fl3i5b6,t3_flvt23,1584785078.0,"Sorry to hear about the breakup. IT's good that you're talking to a professional. Never be ashamed to talk to someone if you're going through a tough time.  I would honestly say just to figure yourself out and see what you're about.

Truth is you weren't ready. At least you're aware of this and are looking into it. Take this as a teaching moment. IT's not uncommon to feel what you're feeling but be mindful of what that does to your partner to never be able to indulge in the things couples can do because by being in the closet you're putting him back in the closet as well. 

So when you're ready to accept yourself and come out then it can begin. Coming out of the closet is such a heavy thing. But when it's time you'll know and only do it for yourself. Not because of some guy or for whatever reason, you do it for you."
AskGayMen,fkxw8em,t3_fkzxmm,1584636628.0,It‚Äôs interesting to see the mindset behind this. I‚Äôm the same way as I rarely (if ever) get hard during sex and I know some good might feel a certain way if they‚Äôve finished but I haven‚Äôt even show up to the race so to speak.

AskGayMen,fkjxsye,t3_fi7j9z,1584264641.0,Could just be performance anxiety? Or maybe because subconsciously you‚Äôre used to finishing alone that when you‚Äôre with someone you kind of freeze?
AskGayMen,fkjxolk,t3_fix8cx,1584264478.0,"Hmm it sounds like he‚Äôs trying to make an effort to be what you like for him to be. As humans, we tend to chip little bits and pieces of ourselves to conform to whatever situation we‚Äôre in. Like when you‚Äôre in school and you want to fit in with a group of kids who may or may not share the same interests as you but you do your best to get them to like you by agreeing or disagreeing with whatever. The point here is, in relationships we try to break pieces off of ourselves to fit the mold so that we can fit better with our partner. Relationships are about compromise yes, but if your needs or desires aren‚Äôt being met or vice versa you both need to sit down and talk about where you‚Äôre at mentally and emotionally.

ETA: As for the ideal partner I think that changes as you get older. Nothing wrong with having standards but understand that sometimes the best connections are not the ones we seek out. They‚Äôre the ones that catch you completely off guard."
AskGayMen,fkij63t,t3_finw4h,1584221253.0,"Sorry to hear what you‚Äôve been going through. If I‚Äôm being honest you should really take some time and find a way to separate your feelings for him. From what you‚Äôre telling us he really only sees you as a friend and while that could change you could be missing out on other potentials instead of waiting for him.

Rule of thumb, never trust the feelings of someone who is going through a breakup. 9/10 they‚Äôre vulnerable and their emotions are raw. Not saying they‚Äôre not valid just that they‚Äôre a little clouded."

AskGayMen,fjoa8t2,t3_fefupj,1583523707.0,Honestly we try so hard to oversimplify things by placing labels and putting things in categories but at the end of it all it‚Äôs more complex then that. If you want to put a label I would say more likely bisexual. Bisexual being in terms of still being attracted to both but who you choose to date is dependent on you. But like I said don‚Äôt need to put a label on it if you don‚Äôt want to.

relationship_advice,fhdvfmu,t3_f2eytj,1581503670.0,"Honestly a lot of red flags going up. I admire and respect you for sticking to what you truly want. Out of respect I will say that your wife does sound like having kids is like buying some new furniture or something. I understand people can change their minds over time but saying that she wished she knew about your choices before getting married was out of line. 

With that being said, you sound pretty content with having just the two. Based on your post you made it pretty clear early on that you didn't want to limit a certain number of kids but just see how things work along the way. I say don't have a third one because two things happen 1) You're enabling her behavior and it will be the fuel for her to use for when she wants another one after #3 and then 2) There is a chance you may not only resent your wife but this baby as well. Not saying you won't love them just that in the back of your mind you may resent them a bit because you were happy with just the two you have now. And that the baby is only here in the world because you gave in."

Some guys might be doing it subconsciously and others just to see a reaction.
PrettyLittleLiars,fg82xgn,t3_ett4a5,1580608103.0,"I was just thinking this. Seasons 1 and 2 were PHENEOMENAL. From what I've read, the writers were originally given a 3 seasons arc for the series. I guess at the time no one knew just how big the show as going to be. Even when Mona was talking to The Second A at the end of season 2, you felt that the story wasn't exactly over and the new mystery for season 3 would be about who was Mona's Partner. But I get the feeling the writers changed their minds so much it created way too many plot holes. I think things took a real dive once we learned Alison was actually alive this whole time. To me, that was the mystery that was driving the series."

Screenwriting,ff73a6a,t3_eruogt,1579640259.0,Actually I find that it's not uncommon for many movies to have more than one theme. But I do agree that there needs to be at least one strong and very present theme of a movie. This is the theme that is kind of obvious to point out but then there are little sub or mini themes sprinkled here and there.

Season 2 starts with the officer thinking he's won but the mouse lets it be known he got the wrong mouse.

Screenwriting,fdhjydw,t3_eld7pu,1578424244.0,"I have different ways of character development. One way I like to think what I would do in this scenario and then have the character do the complete opposite. Another way to look at it is see what kind of life this character leads before and during the time they came about in your story. Also one thing to keep in mind that there is complexity in a characters actions. 

Ex: A Queen with a heart that's cold like marble and hard like Coal holds a reputation for executing anyone who upsets her. She's faced with the choice to kill or spare beggar but she hesitates. Why does she hesitate with this one beggar and not the others? Could it be because he reminds her of someone she knew once a long time ago? Or could it be because she's had a change of heart as of late because being the viscous queen everyone thinks she is, has gotten her nowhere?"

One being that you're moving and Two, it sounds like you might just not be interested in him as more than a friend. It's weird to think about because of gay culture it seems like with every guy you come in contact with we're supposed to have these instant sparks and bleh bleh bleh but in reality we can honestly just connect with people but on a platonic level.

But to answer your question, just let him know what the situation is if he doesn't already know. If he's interested in talking more on a friendly level Long Distance then that's an option as well."

But after that encounter, he finally got a modest understanding of what magic is capable of. In this instance to protect and not harm. And that maybe while the Wizarding world is one he doesn‚Äôt understand and that it is dangerous it can be good as well as Harry showed despite all else he was willing to protect him and by extension his family with magic.

Which leads me to the last point, Jonas was hit by a truck and killed with a tire iron. Not a Knife. Mr Jingles mainly using sharp objects to kill. I feel like there's another player in this killing game. No way Margaret could kill the campers, get in a car and manage to track down Jonas at night all within a few minutes. Especially since he was running. Unless it was Jingles and he just used a weapon of opportunity."
AmItheAsshole,f1ebamr,t1_f1earw1,1569418022.0,I actually burst out laughing when I saw this. Because it does sound a lot like her.
AmItheAsshole,f1eb5yv,t1_f1eaii2,1569417928.0,Yes I realized the mistake in the title after posting. It's not just me calling her and her not wanting to talk. It's about the collective behavior that led up to what happened with the phone call.
AmericanHorrorStory,f1e46q9,t3_d91tc5,1569412162.0,"I feel like it may have to do with being drawn to someone who hasn't had a sexual experience yet. There's a glimmer of innocence and purity that makes a lot of the characters attracted to Brooke. While it's easier to hook up with someone who is oversexualized, it makes it more interesting to find someone who shys away from it."
askgaybros,f0qnnd3,t3_d5yd1o,1568862974.0,When I was in Highschool the summer before my senior year my mom hires a guy to come and mow are lawn every other week. Now I stayed home during the summer so I would ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù look out the window to see him shirtless doing the yard work. (One day he actually caught me looking lol) And was a few months after school started I realized the guy was in one of my classes.
AskGayMen,exjzwjf,t3_cssk0i,1566366527.0,"My relationship with my father was a rollercoaster. Because he was in the military since I was born, he was in and out of my life because of his job. Of course technology was growing all the time so you had skype and things like that to communicate but it still wasn't the same. My mom basically raised me while my dad was away in another country. I lived for the times when he was able to stay with us but it got harder once he had to leave again. (I was told later by my mom that he felt guilty all the time) Things got better as I got older but he missed out on nearly half my life. He always tried to be there when he was living at home before being shipped off again and again. But he was able to stay a lot more when he I was in highschool. Now well into adulthood, I think we've gotten closer. He was even accepting of me when I first came out in highschool. And now, we talk and I've realized that I'm pretty much like him (another thing I've been told over the years)."
depression,exjyan0,t3_ct268j,1566364687.0,I definitely do. More so it reminds me of how my life used to be before learning some family secrets I wish I didn't know about. Now I look back and while I miss those moments with my family I have to look at things differently now.
Paranormal,ev530n5,t3_cifrin,1564226627.0,"It's actually not that uncommon. When I was younger I used to be able to see spirits and to this day I sometimes get visions through my dreams. I remember when I was a kid, I was in the car with my mother and I don't know what possessed me to ask her this but I asked if anyone in our family had dreams like mine. Without hesitation my mother said that her mother (my grandmother) had dreams like that too. 

Sadly I was never able to ask my grandmother because she had passed away right before my fist birthday."
grindr,ev4um35,t3_cidipd,1564221779.0,"As interesting as that would be, for safety reasons I can see why they wouldn't do that."
askgaybros,ev4udoi,t3_ci6rwx,1564221634.0,"Before you go and confront him (which should be a no brainer at this point) think about whether or not you want to stay with him. Only you can decide if this is something that can break you two apart. Some guys are okay with the idea and others are not. 

The bottom line here is that he lied to you. Not only was he on Grindr but he sat there and lied to your face and played it off like he never had it in the first place. Which btw if he has an iPhone you can always go back to the App Store and find out if he's downloaded it already."
askgaybros,euzrpre,t3_chykli,1564125152.0,"In retrospect, we're in the era of Hookup culture where people are smashed and passed or swiping left or right and being super liked. 

But I wouldn't say easier but I would say straight dating is more attainable. With gay dating most of the talking is chained to apps and websites but with straight dating, there's other ways of getting dates beyond apps and the internet basically."
askgaybros,euzr6tn,t3_chpoie,1564124868.0,"If it's said in like the heat of the moment, then no. But if it's being said on repeat then yeah it bothers me."
AmItheAsshole,euzn7sp,t3_chlcbo,1564122852.0,YTA I was on your side until that last paragraph. Saying no because basically this new friend told your daughter to join so she wouldn't have the same reputation in high school is one thing but saying no because she would be injured and because you're worried that it would be oversexualized is a whole other thing. You've pushed your kids to try out for sports and back then you knew there had to be possibilities with injuries but it wasn't a problem until Cheerleading was in the mix.
askgaybros,eu770tg,t3_cf3vo3,1563520208.0,"Sorry you're going through this! Rule of thumb I always say is less is more. Most guys don't want all of the emotions and personal connections up front especially not all at once. Sometimes the best thing is to give it little by little. Sadly, a lot of guys aren't into hearing someone's life story. Not saying what happened was that case but it sounded more like pillow talk."
AskGayMen,eu6ojwt,t3_ceuqvw,1563505102.0,Just be straight up with him and say you have nothing against him or gay people in general but you two can't be anything more than friends.
depression,etml0w3,t1_etliaz2,1562962347.0,I guess a little of both? It's always been there but sometimes it comes out of nowhere and sometimes it's triggered by something external. I could be fine for a day then depressed the next day and then be fine again. And often when im really frustrated or upset its a lot worse and then the suicidal thoughts kick in. But sometimes those thoughts just come out of nowhere.
depression,etldckr,t3_cc4g1s,1562932761.0,I dont know.
depression,etld87o,t3_cc4zak,1562932635.0,"I envy you honestly. My mom cried when I first told her as a teen. She even broke down and said she didn't want me to leave her. All I could do is hug her and tell her everything was going to be okay, like I was the parent and she was the child. But I still felt no emotion behind it, I'd already made up my mind that it would happen one day. Just not that day. Now here we are 7 years later and there's a whole different tune."
AskGayMen,epv06lm,t3_bvuqss,1559520768.0,"I mean I get an ego boost if people find me attractive regardless of gender haha. But honestly, I'm flattered. I've had it happen a couple of times and it always put a smile on my face."
AskGayMen,epuzy8d,t3_bvxkut,1559520590.0,"Well for one thing, sexuality and porn aren't always correlated. There are plenty of straight people who watch gay porn and vice versa. It doesn't change their sexuality. How I look at it is like this, I'm getting ready for bed and as I'm turning off the light, who do I see on the other side of the bed telling me goodnight? A man or a woman? Porn is good for sexual release and fantasies but it doesn't mean you will act on those fantasies."
askgaybros,epil2jz,t3_buqnn6,1559240471.0,People tend to say things in the heat of the moment or right after sex that sometimes we never really mean. A lot of guys are flip flops. They want something one day and then three days later they want something completely different. If it's been a week I wouldn't even bother with it but that's just me.
askgaybros,ep4p09g,t3_btxo37,1559043570.0,"I would say It was probably around 19-20 maybe? I just felt like guys my age weren't really all that serious and while having fun is key in a relationship, I wanted someone who wouldn't have time for the mind games and the flakiness."
askgaybros,ep4orw8,t3_bts1u5,1559043467.0,"Actually you're not alone in this. I find anal isn't really pleasurable unless it's with someone I trust. Plus there's a lot of maintenance that goes into it before hand and it becomes a mess (literally and metaphorically). While Anal does look nice to watch, I find doing other things is can still be pleasurable for both parties."
AskGayMen,ep4o3mv,t3_btxrcs,1559043160.0,"I think people in general can be faithful but it just boils down to the individuals. If we're talking just men, yes, I believe there are men out there who can be faithful. For me, it feels like there are too many opportunities to be able to cheat. I'm going to sound like my grandfather for a second so bare with me, but with social media, the internet and all these dating apps, it's getting easier and easier for people to cheat and there are so many temptations out there. I think it's possible if people would take a look for a second and realize what they're about to do is all kinds of wrong. 

OR a sociological approach: People in relationships tend to compare their SO to other people and see if it's better to stick with their SO or to see if the grass is greener."
AskGayMen,eoy4kma,t3_btfyfw,1558933653.0,"Sadly, bi curious guys are tricky. For them, it's really more so about the experiment and trying to scratch that itch they have. They want to see if being with a man is something they might be into for sure or not. So MOST bi curious guys aren't really looking for anything past a hookup."
askgaybros,eom2lnv,t3_bs5sqv,1558680626.0,Said this somewhere else but you sound like hookups aren't for you. You want a boyfriend and not a random guy off an app. Which is perfectly okay because a lot of guys are like that.
askgaybros,eom2gbp,t3_bsb64x,1558680553.0,"I agree with everyone else, it was your first time and that feeling you had afterwards most likely it was because you were with some random guy. Believe me, what you're feeling is not uncommon. I say explore a bit more but 1) Be safe about it and 2) explore with someone you can trust I.e. someone who's more than just a stranger. You may very well be against the hookup culture and that's fine, a lot of us are like that. It took me years to realize that while sex can be great, I continue to get that empty feeling afterwards because there's no connection. It's like you come and go and put on your clothes and out the door."
askgaybros,eom1tdi,t3_bs4ey7,1558680194.0,"Oh the stories I have. Not to say I can't have straight guy friends, but there's a reason why I tend to stray away from having straight guy friends cause sometimes I develop a crush on them. My freshman year of college, there was a guy in my class who was exactly my type. I mean: Dark hair, tan skin, beautiful brown eyes, quirky yet attainable almost and he just had the brightest smile I'd ever seen. (Now you see the issue). He invited me to hang out, out of the blue when I was supposed to go over a friends house and we went and got food and sat and talked. IT was really nice and I started to think at the very least he could be just this cute shy guy who may have been bisexual or gay. We spent more and more time together and when he invited me to this one fancy restaurant, I started thinking ""damn this guy is really trying to start something."" Well when I got there, it was him and about fifteen other people. He seemed to want to show me off, even going as far as resting his hand on my shoulder and starting at me while we ate dinner. I guess this is more of a different story but in the end, found out he had girlfriend or something like that."
