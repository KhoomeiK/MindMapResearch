Step 1: Wake up

Step 2: Go to School

Step 3: Watch Youtube

Step 4: Go to Sleep

Welcome to my life. It sucks, it's boring. I don't even jack off anymore that's how little joy I have left. Youtube is also getting stale now so I wonder much time I got left before I overdose...

Btw anybody know how quickly paracetamol poisoning kills you thx"

depression,eud8xhb,t3_cfptw5,1563707899.0,"Yup. Was feeling better thinking ""okay I might actually be able to keep living with just some bad thougts sometimes"" and then over the last week I just fell down the rabbit hole again. Started thinking about suicide, but like doing it not just the regular thoughts. Kinda sucks when I think about how I was pretty okay a while back."

depression,ets7zrf,t3_cd4hhi,1563138780.0,"Yup. I masturbate almost everyday, been doing that for literal years now (daily that is).

SuicideWatch,etgcji3,t3_cbbowo,1562788121.0,"I'm of the (personal) belief ttat there is some kind of spirituality that we simply don't know about. Like, some kind of afterlife. I'm very sciencey myself and rational, logical and all that shit. But this is the one department where I hope there is something better after we die. Eternal black is scary to me."
SuicideWatch,etgc7g1,t3_cbk8i7,1562787935.0,"I saw a couple walking along the pier holding hands yesterday, it immedietly made me extremely sad and self-concious. Still kinda feel like shit knowing I will literally never have that."

SuicideWatch,erl8m1z,t3_c2k2kq,1560980899.0,"This is the only real thing holding me back from suicide. I actually wish I was more religious so that I actually believe in heaven and could look forward to that. But idk anymore and it makes me nervous because we have to die at some point.

I like to believe that there is something spiritual that we just can't or don't understand right now."

CasualConversation,epvvsag,t1_epvvpvh,1559554047.0,"Surprisingly calm. I usually take the bus which always bumps around and stuff. The train is very stable, doesn't bump around and watching the countryside go by is like therapy!"
CasualConversation,epvvqqj,t1_epvvmpl,1559553971.0,It's one of the large cities in the area. It has a lot of stuff to do compared to the tiny suburb I live in. So I'm quite excited just to go about the city and see everything.
