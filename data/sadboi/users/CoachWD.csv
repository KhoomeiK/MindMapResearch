AskAnAmerican,fqty7g1,t1_fqt6p3i,1589648394.0,"Absolutely! Work to increase your hip mobility through stretches and exercise. One reason we lose flexibility is weakened muscles. As a muscle gets weaker, it contracts itself a bit so that it can protect itself from being overextended. Also, just practice putting yourself into that deep squat. Find something study to hold onto and drop down into the squat. Do that daily and eventually, it’ll get easier and easier. One of the most important parts is to keep your heels down with your feet about hip width. Your lower legs should be perpendicular to your feet as well. Over the years, I’ve been able to retrain my body to be able to do it. It’s still not a position I can be in for very long, but I can at least do it."

However, in college, I took a World Geography class that was one of the best classes I’ve ever taken. It was taught by an old guy from Estonia that told stories of escaping both the Russians and the Nazi’s during WW2. We covered every continent, except the US (he assumed we knew US geography fairly well already). He taught by telling stories and our “homework” was to color and label maps of countries and regions. We had to color in major rivers, lakes, cities, and topographical items such as mountains, plateaus, deserts and forests. I got more out of that class than almost any one I’ve ever taken. His story of escaping Europe during WW2 was like out of a movie."
AskAnAmerican,fqkubbw,t3_gjdyvn,1589436496.0,"I actually had a professor in college that was huge on teaching about this issue. He taught that one main reason Americans have problems with this is that once we start school around age 5, we begin sitting in chairs for 5-7 hrs a day and generally maintain a 90 degree hip angle, which over time, decreases our hip mobility. Generally speaking, we develop a fairly weak posterior chain, which further decreases flexibility. That, along with using a flat desk to write on causes our back to hunch over and our shoulders to slouch and round forward. The combined result of all of this makes our shoulder mobility shit, our backs to be slouched and our posture to be generally fucked. A flat footed deep squat SHOULD be a resting and neutral body position. If you look at kids about 6 and under, a lot of them will resort to the deep squat in lieu of sitting down. Once kids reach about 7-8, they start gradually losing the ability to do it. I’m a PE teacher and every year I talk to my students about this and anecdotally, many more of my K-2 students can do it than my 6th-8th students."

The new doctor listened to what was going on a prescribed me exercise, a healthier diet, meditation along with an SSRI and Xanax. I did some research on the medications as I’d never taken either of them. After research, I decided that the potential side effects of the SSRI were worse than the issues I was having. Xanax is pretty low risk and I’ve got no history of substance abuse so I decided to stick with that at low doses. I told my doctor all of this and he was fine with it.

The early models mostly predicted what would happen if no safety measures were put into place.

Early on, there was so much noise in the data that no one really knew what was important in regards to what they were seeing.

Currently, I teach Physical Education and Health for Kindergarten-8th grade at a private school, coach high school girls soccer and manage a city pool during the summer. I’m engaged to be married in October. My only real “adult problems” are $50K in student loan debt (my fiancé has none thank god) and a newly diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder.

I always look up the doctor when I see these videos and I’ve seen dozens of chiropractors and plastic surgeons speaking in Covid19. When I ask my friend why I should trust anything a chiropractor or plastic surgeon has to say about virology or immunology, the only response I get is, “well they ARE a doctor!” or “I mean it could be true?” Ffs..it boggles my mind that people think just because someone has “Dr.” in front of their name that they are a reliable source."

Part of it also depends on my alcohol intake as I find myself talking with more of my natural drawl when I’ve had a few drinks. Also, going to school and being friends with a lot of Canadians and people from all over the US played havoc with my speech patterns and country drawl."

That guy was a bit of a nut job anyway but he was awesome. Had he been an idiot, he probably would have been labeled crazy. Since he was academically brilliant, he was just thought to be eccentric. We sat around talking about different papers Freud wrote every day for 3 hours. More or less the only thing i got out of it was that dudes wanna bang their moms and Freud was a penis loving coke head."

He allowed us to include lessons on STD/STI’s but only in a clinical “communicable infection” sense. We were told to say they can be spread by IV drug use and “risky life choices” but not to elaborate on that. As for the issue of premarital sex, we were told “let the religion teacher handle that”. The religion teacher teaches it as Circle of Grace (think personal bubble) and not allowing anyone into your Circle or Grace without your permission. Also, sex before marriage is a sin and don’t do it. That’s it, end of story. Also, 100% not allowed to talk about masturbation."
