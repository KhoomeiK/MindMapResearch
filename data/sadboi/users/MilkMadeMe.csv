schizophrenia,fg2v7z4,t3_ewiu3f,1580457328.0,"I really liked  ‚ÄúSurviving Schizophrenia: A Family Manual‚Äù for some hard updated facts on the diagnosis and its many ramifications. The author is a clinical psychologist and also has a family member with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Some sections are more helpful than others. 

Medicines for schizophrenia have a ton of side effects, but skipping some meds ‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù can be straight up dangerous as a few require a tapering down of dosage that‚Äôs less damaging to the body and brain. I‚Äôd ask your cuz how he normally remembers to take them. Have him set phone alarms, get a pill organizer before the trip ‚Äî whatever works for him but is a prerequisite for the trip. Maybe you would not be ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for meds, just more like a pill cheerleader. üíä

Like the other commenter said, my relative is overwhelmed with some new sensory experiences. Checking in regularly through the day sounds like a super respectful idea. Maybe he needs more alone time or some space? Maybe he would like to know a list of everything that would probably happen, like a schedule of events?  Perhaps he could help pay for his own room or what have you depending on his preferences. Might be fun to try a day trip to work your way up to something more involved and feel prepared and safe for all parties involved! Just thoughts here. 

Having lived with a person with schizophrenia, all the ‚Äúscary‚Äù hallucinations are far less scary than a PoS predator type at a bar, for me at least as a young female. I have never feared for MY safety or well being. Everyone is so different though. Hallucinations can be real mofos. Many of my family members just can‚Äôt handle being around it, and I can‚Äôt make them be comfortable with it even if I try. Maybe your cousin would be willing to share what it‚Äôs like for him in those times where hallucinations are present? And what he does to ground himself?

I respect that you want to bring joy to this relative‚Äôs life. Allowing him to make choices that are important to him is paramount, I think. These are some new experiences for him and it might be hard in a good or bad way. But it would be important to know how you could best help him through a hard moment if one arises. Feel like he could give you best insight there!"

slp,fel3vg1,t3_epqaxs,1579213494.0,"Firstly, that shit sucks. All of it. I have had friends in grad school struggle with the same problems. I‚Äôm sorry that the environment is unprofessional to say the least.  Some of my bright, bilingual friends have ‚Äúintimidated‚Äù seasoned monolingual SLPs and incurred racist remarks as a result. Some have just been dragged through the mud and expected to deal with that ‚ÄúI know best‚Äù power play. Our field requires us to constantly learn and at the very least, entertain the newest research that is available. I feel like that is why most supervisors enjoy taking on graduate clinicians. 

I have had friends put their heads down, power through, and survive 12-16 weeks of similar misery.  Not ideal (downright gross, IMO), but they did it to graduate and get the hell out. At the end of the day, they are your boss, and if you can continue to express the learning you have garnered in school in a respectful way, do it (i.e. ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I just learned about FEES, what are your thoughts given your experience; do you think any of these fluency techniques might help X?‚Äù). Doesn‚Äôt mean you will change your supervisor‚Äôs opinion, unfortunately. Doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt suck ass to take the moral high ground. People like this exist in the working world, although I feel like few and far between. 

I have also had friends quit their placement and extend another semester ‚Äî not sure if your university would make you wait until the next batch of rotations/following semester (like mine did) or if they would find you a new placement. Those friends felt embarrassed but for them it was better than being with toxic supervisors they had to be on edge with 24/7.

Grad school is not real life, but it is real right now. Sorry it‚Äôs hard. You have come too far to give up, but you can make a decision that is best for you."

schizophrenia,fddnezl,t3_ekr48b,1578318627.0,"In my experience with my grandmother and from what I have, religious fantasies are a common theme in her most manic times (I.e. refusing food for a ‚Äúpure body,‚Äù visualizing me or relatives as Catholic religious figures, etc.). You are not alone there. 

Some days I am able to help ground her in reality by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to help you shower today‚Äù or ‚Äúyou need to eat today.‚Äù I always make a point to eat with her and not force her to do it on her own while I watch. I aim to provide ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù as much as possible ‚Äî I‚Äôm not rushed or forcing too hard. I‚Äôm there to spend time with her. She is motivated by time together, though. And it has taken many years for her to know I am a person to trust in these hard situations and I can help guide her make good decisions. I find speaking in simple sentences helps her understand WTF needs to be done in the most manic times. The simpler the better. My grandma is not dumb (and in my experience people with schizophrenia are super beyond bright), but she does exhibit that sort of expressive/receptive aphasia in her hard times because complex language is too much to comprehend since her brain is working overtime on whatever it is seeing/living/experiencing.

Other days that are harder to reach her I sometimes play along with the hallucinations, like speaking aloud to voices to say ‚Äúwe are done with you right now. I‚Äôm with my grandma now and it‚Äôs time to eat.‚Äù I have NO idea if this is kosher, but I do feel like getting on that level with her when needed sometimes helps her understand that I am not judging what‚Äôs going on for her. I can accept that it is the reality of the moment.

Sometimes both of these techniques work, sometimes neither work. Sometimes I am the bad guy in her mind. It took me years to not take it personally. *There are times where we simply cannot help by our actions alone.* Period. It does make me feel angry, but not at my grandma, just at the powerlessness of the situation. It is, for the most part, something totally out of our control. We provide a support role, but we cannot take away the whole struggle. 

Medicine and removing stressful triggers for my grandma has been helpful in my family. It takes time to figure out what those stress triggers are and what medicines work best. And since we are human, these things change over time. Sometimes meds and simple living are not enough to keep the illness at bay. Someone else here suggested a book, and as a family member I personally learned a lot from the book by a clinical psychologist called ‚ÄúSurviving Schizophrenia: A Family Manual.‚Äù The author also has a sister with schizophrenia, and I really felt comfort in knowing that he has a clinical knowledge as well as a personal knowledge in this kind of situation. The book is updated as time passes to keep in line with the most recent research on schizophrenia.

This is a difficult disease and one we cannot have full control over. I feel for the hurt you are enduring, and although it is sad to think about, your brother and my grandma are experiencing so much more strife than we are. We simply just cannot understand it all completely. And that‚Äôs OK. We will still do our best to help. We are human too though. This is a team effort: medical team, family team, and your brother at the center of the team. It may feel like he can‚Äôt make good decisions at times, but it is still his life and he deserves to have that autonomy of choice. 

Love to you and your family. There will be hard times, but they can pass. Over time you will find out what helps you brother best. Patience is hard to have in this struggle, but it is needed.  These are just my experiences and may not help you one bit, but you are not alone."

I think you‚Äôre right, and need to do some farther flung research on some psychiatrists who are more familiar with her diagnosis and give her the respect/empathy she deserves. I get the vibe that a lot of psychiatrists deal with elderly people and dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs, but always raise eyebrows when they find out my grandma‚Äôs diagnosis is schizophrenia. 

Loving her has been a hard lesson in unconditional love and our need to meet people where they are, but there is so much to love about her even with schizophrenia.
