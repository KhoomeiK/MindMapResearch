Genuinely curious, since I watched MSI groups and they hardly even said where LMS is from and that's an actual major region. I have Googled for several of them, but it's actually surprisingly buried when you do. Again, I opened with the statement that this is petty, but as someone who enjoys watching pro play, it would be great if I could tell who the hell anyone was without having to go out of my way to find it, since, you know, esports is a pretty big money maker for Riot and they want more people to watch it so they can make more money off it."

If they could just say ""for those unfamiliar with the emerging regions..."" a couple times it would make it so much easier.

leagueoflegends,f2ky8oq,t1_f2kxgpc,1570290302.0,"First, all I really need is for them to explicitly say the name of the region at least twice in each match. That's all I'm asking. The entire first day of play-ins I knew none of the regions except LCS. And I now remember none except Russia, and only because of AHaHaCiK. (I can read a bit of the Russian alphabet, it helps.)

But if it *was* on the screen, I actually think there's a way to make it work by combining the idea I referenced. Extend the team name slot by a bit. Put the league they're from in that spot, with the flag of the country behind it or next to it. For regions with multiple countries, either use the biggest/most dominant or have them sort of split diagonally. I'm basing this on how Mortal Kombat lists their players in the nameplates on the pro kompetition circuit, and I don't see how it would add a significant amount of stuff to the screen."

TeamSolomid,f1w5z9h,t3_d1ukxm,1569780693.0,"I'll start with the biggest change I'd like to see, which is ADC. Honestly, I'm thinking of Tyler1. We all know his faults, but we also know the things he won't falter in. He can dominate lane, he doesn't second guess himself (a weakness sometimes, but it feels to me like Zven never totally got over spring split finals), he can play back if he has to. Try him out and see if he works with Smoothie well. There's really nothing left to lose here. I have nothing against Zven, I know how hard he's trying, but something massive has to shift in the team, and I don't think there's a bigger shakeup a team could get than signing Tyler.

Top: Broken Blade has had some great performances, but either the jungle synergy isn't working or he's just not consistent enough yet. Either way, put him in academy for a bit. Either to get him more practice or to get him a jungler he can work well with.

Mid: We all know Bjergsen is staying. Honestly though, if TSM misses Worlds again next year, I don't think that will still be true. I think that would be the point where he'd seriously consider another offer.

Support: I have minimal impression of Smoothie tbh, I think the biggest problem there is the bot lane synergy. Again, try out Tyler or some other radical shift. (I cannot express how much it would amuse me to see every TSM opponent spending a ban on Draven forever.)

Jungler I'm pretty sure is a wide open position right now anyway. Just make sure the person who's picked can live up to it."

Loot boxes that you can purchase with real money, don't care how many transactions it took to launder it. And frankly, ""premium currency"" in video games in general are usually pretty shit. Let me give you ten fucking dollars for a skin without having a random twenty game buck$ or whatever left over."
AskReddit,eystlfy,t1_eyrgikt,1567411531.0,"The ONLY benefit to this is that there's medications for things you don't even know exist sometimes, and that you wouldn't ask a doctor for because you think it's normal or can't be fixed. The drawback is people then thinking they know more than their doctor, and advertising frequently being predatory in general."

And that I have a stable job that allows me to drop $40 on a single month of a single pill.)"

And to be clear, I bought the chroma bundle to start with, so it's not like I went from buying the skin to buying everything. I wanted the chromas, I wanted the emote, I was going to need the pass anyway, and I decided farming shards and buying the border and icon would be a better use of the rest of the event time and pass that forcing myself to grind another 250 tokens to get one thing that I could just buy with RP I'd already paid for."
