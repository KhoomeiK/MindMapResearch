You'll eventually real that the shortness of breath is really just a flaw in our thinking. Where focus goes energy flows. Since you are focusing on your breathing you have to be consciously aware of taking those breaths which can give you that same sensation. I've seen real world that anxiety and this symptom is a trick of the mind. YEs it's technically real but its all because of your focus. If you want to test this theory, get another problem. Stub your toe, or something. I had a sore achilles while all this was going on at one point and it took all my focus for 2 days. those 2 days not one breathing issue. Find something you enjoy and can put your focus into and don't give anxiety more attention than it deserves."

&#x200B;

Dont feel like its your fault or did anything wrong in this situation or this guy was happy to fire you because you were a bad worker.

&#x200B;

I think everyone thrives in the environment that is best fit for them. Some people strive on fast pace and commotion and others dont, thats no dig against you. It just means that the particular environment isnt a fit for your personality type. 

The feeling you felt was probably just general nerves saying I dont like this atmosphere. After that first day you knew it wasnt for you, you were likely going to quit after a few days anyway. SO the fact he fired you is not because of your skills lacking but if it mutually being a bad fit.

  
And as for his nonchalant or carelessness in his text and firing you. Think of this perspective. It is a business and clearly  fast paced one. Some people are taught to operate with class and proper customer service ect. A pizza owner may not have that training. He was focused on moving forward to the next person who could fill that void he needed filled.

&#x200B;

Dont take it personally.

Goodluck :)"
