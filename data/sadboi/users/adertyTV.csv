On your second point it's pretty much the same thing as the first one.

On your third point it depends on what was said because you can't control other peoples feelings and therefore context is needed to decide if it was an appropriate reaction or not.

And yes, you can label negative behavior as toxic if it helps differentiate what is good or bad for you and/or others. If you can distinguish why it's bad instead of good you've learned more.

If we can understand what something feels like from multiple perspectives and especially why it does so, it's not a waste of time. That's basic way to increase knowledge and imo basis for psychology."

I can't think of anything I want in life anymore and this has been like this for multiple months.

I belive it is absolutely wrong to have kids if you know about these things they have to deal with, depending on what's the possibility but if you know hard it could be for that child to handle life you definitely shouldn't leave it up for a chance. If you truly know how painful it could be you would never have children on these conditions.

While it still saddens me I want to hold on to the idea of adoption, if I'm ever capable of finding a partner and raising a child I do want to adopt.

AmItheAsshole,fjm31ef,t3_fe1npt,1583460454.0,"YTA. Your complete lack of empathy is disturbing, also that you can't seem to acknowledge the fact that not everyone is like you and just because you don't understand how feelings work doesn't mean it won't hurt others.

Instead of calling this prank ""harmless"" or trying to even blame him for falling for this you should just remove yourself from his life, he doesn't deserve this and will be much better off without you.
This would be the right time for some self reflection but I guess your narcissistic tendencies wouldn't like the thought of you having some flaws."

Well, we ended up talking a bit longer. She skipped the next 2 busses and left when the third one was coming. She hugged me before getting on the bus, I really didn't see that coming but I couldn't help but smile a bit on my way back home."

AmItheAsshole,fjij86x,t1_fjhdggg,1583368840.0,"The boyfriend is insecure and controlling and you shouldn't enable that behavior.
You should be able to trust your partner if she spends some time alone with a friend.
Even if there has been some other friend that has tried something it doesn't mean it's okay to cut off all one on one time with her friends, it's not fair to the OP to be accused of something like that nor is it fair for her.

It's insane to say OP is more controlling than the boyfriend is by not giving into the boyfriends insecurities.
It's also an ultimatum by her, double date or nothing."

Sorry that you got cheated on, that's fucked up. Still it wasn't right to beat someone up and you seem to know that already but that's something that has been done and cannot be changed, only can try to accept it and move on with life. Honestly that situation sounds horrible and I have no idea if I would've done the same so you have my sympathy.

You're still here even after everything that's happened, you're goddamn strong human being and you can grow even more from all of this. These are the meaningless words from an stranger that doesn't know you but I'll say it anyway, I believe in you and you got this! Hope you feel better soon."

Then after a couple of days (depends on what day it is and what plans I have for the week) I ask her out.

It's better to do sooner than later.
It's important to see how the chemistry works in person or if it's just not working at all.
Also it shows if the person is actually interested in meeting you and not just bored and enjoying the attention.
And if you keep texting someone for a longer time without meeting them in person you're just creating your own version of that person in your head which might be very different in reality."

Try to focus on small goals, It's fine to not be able to power through every day, the important part is to keep doing it after setbacks and you will eventually get there.

Also I picked up exercise and really got on with it as a way to cope with my anxiety, running as hard as you can or doing push ups until you can't do another one really helps on those rough moments. After training I feel better about myself and it just helps my mental health in every way."

And me saying this probably won't make a difference as you'll truly get it after you've done those things.

I had my first kiss at 23 and lost my virginity at 25, kissing someone or having sex doesn't change who I am as a person.
Those things just feel really impactful for you because you haven't experienced them and then you compare yourself to others who have, like because others are doing it so why I am not?

If you focus on your own life and improving yourself you'll eventually get there and most likely then you realize you're still the same person as before kissing/sex."

I've had pretty bad last 2 days and it keeps going, I find it hard to do anything. I try to just silence my thoughts in any way I can so I won't overthink too much or think about the feelings of emptiness that leads to suicidality again. I'm listening to music nonstop, try to watch netflix or play some games but honestly it's not really helping. I would try to exercise but I'm also sick atm and need to rest."
AskMen,fhcq23e,t1_fhcns23,1581468343.0,"Ofcourse not.

It's just the harsh reality that things won't change if you do nothing about it.
If you keep trying things will change, there isn't some easy magic fix for most of the problems in life but you just have to keep trying.

You're also still really young, don't beat yourself up by calling yourself lazy etc. It's a self fulfilling prophecy.
As some other users have said talk about this in therapy, really talk about the most hardest thoughts you have. Those are the ones that also help you the most."

I often have trouble with these existential thoughts and what gives my life a meaning, I think it's just important to hold on what feels right at the moment.

Learn and follow your values, in my opinion those should guide you in life.
Personally at the times I've been able to help someone I felt like I had meaning, to make a difference in someones life even if it's just a small thing."
