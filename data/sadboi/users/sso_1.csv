I’ve had people ask if I’m sick, question anorexia, tell me I’m a stick, tell me I need to eat, I shouldn’t lose any more, I mean the list goes on and on and on. It’s crazy how they all have such a warped view on health. I’m 5’6” and the lowest I’ve gone is 127lbs, that is not anorexic or even close to underweight.

The reason many will hide it is because they don’t want to hurt their partner, they don’t want to feel the shame, the embarrassment, the pain they caused, or the anger from their partner. You hope by hiding it, it’ll be gone and you can move forward and hopefully do better next try. 

Also, beating yourself up with every relapse is a reason for relapse. When working on quitting, relapse is a part of it. Unfortunately it can happen any time, but you work on finding the triggers to prevent them in the future."

loveafterporn,fpsvfit,t3_gfbj0n,1588880283.0,"I'm not sure how my response will be taken, but I have lived through these experiences so why not share.

Anyway, I'm a recovering porn addict, and I'm engaged to marry one as well, so I can offer both perspectives. I can only speak for myself, but maybe that will give some insight. Porn is very hard to quit, and it is a real addiction. I could not get through a day without it on my mind. The beginning of quitting was the absolute hardest. That's when I realized just how bad I was. It made me feel bad, and made me want to go on it even more. It took many many many attempts, but I am finally 203 days free of it and that makes me so happy. That makes my partner happy. 

Yes, my partner helps me want to improve, but I also am doing it for myself. I don't want something having so much control over me like that ever again. I have accidentally viewed a naked body here or there (TV, Movies, random click on Reddit). Those can easily be huge triggers for me, so I've been trying to avoid them.

I'm also in therapy to work on myself and to realize the triggers that push me to go there. Now when I see any nudity, I'm not rushing to find some porn. Almost a year out, and I still have the thoughts randomly. Sometimes I fantasize porn-like scenarios, or I get an urge to watch. It's so easily available, there is so much content, more and more put in the internet world each day. 

Don't hate yourself over porn (I know, easier said than done), I still question my body and have major body issues from finding my partner's porn. Just know there is no comparison between you and fake porn. You're real, you're his person, you're his companion and love. My partner is #1 to me over any porn any day. Yes, I've had slip ups, but I didn't love him less during them, I wasn't less attracted to him, it was my fault for those slip ups. It was a random urge that I couldn't fight, or a trigger from something that happened that day. 

Don't blame yourself, and don't let it get you depressed. The best advice I can give is trying to be as understanding as possible and open to listening. Let him know he can freely speak to you about it all without ever making you angry at him. Its an embarrassing thing to admit, and its hard to discuss with your partner. But I definitely believe recovery is possible for anyone if I am able to stop. 

Discuss how poorly it makes you feel, tell him how hurt, betrayed, etc. you feel. Ask questions about how long its been going on, etc. he should feel 100% comfortable to discuss this like an adult if he's willing to work on it. If he closes up or doesn't want to talk about it, I would say it is still going on and he's wanting to hide it instead of being open with you.

Good Luck!"

- He wasn’t treating you right by giving all of his time and energy to another woman who clearly believed she had a chance with him. 

- Being that he was your boyfriend for five years, he should’ve never given another woman the thought that there was a chance, that means he was leading her on and likely enjoying it.

That is why they’re creating a vaccine, telling everyone to stay indoors, and trying to prevent more infections throughout the world. 

If they wanted herd immunity, they’d let everyone go out and catch it. The strong will survive while the weak will perish, and eventually it will have gone through everyone and no longer be a risk. 

Instead, what I am seeing is, they’re trying to prevent further infection, while they continue to develop testing for antibodies and a vaccine. Their hopes, from what they’ve said on tv and in the news is, that they will be able to send those with antibodies back to work, and those without will get the vaccine to prevent this from continuing."

It’s your decision if you love her enough and want an open relationship, if not, you should definitely end it because she will likely end up cheating. 

Lots of people love to explore kinks to see what they’re into or not. Especially now in the day of porn, it brings such a variety of scenarios into people’s sex life. People want to try it because they saw it and it looked fun. There is also psychology behind having kinks, typically something in their childhood or past. But usually you’ll determine that it was fun but I love my partner and want to compromise. Or you’ll love it and realize regular sex is not for you. Or you hate it and never want to do it again.

Are you willing to compromise and do it maybe 2-3 times a year? Can she accept a compromise? Are you accepting of an open relationship? Those are the decisions you’d both have to make in the end."

relationships,fh7tpkn,t3_f1onh5,1581344456.0,"You define what the boundaries are in your relationship, and you define what cheating is to you. No one else can decide that for you. For me, that was crossing the line and I’d definitely consider it cheating."
dating_advice,fh6xenb,t3_f1atlt,1581308559.0,"Either you discuss it with him to find out or move on. Honestly after having sex and dating for months, you’d think he’d want you to spend the night. But if he thinks of it as just sex and not dating that might be why."

dating_advice,fgsk0qr,t3_ezxnsc,1581086278.0,"I would just straight up ask him. There’s no way we can figure out what he’s thinking. He obviously likes you if he continues texting after each date but I’m not sure why he’s not motivated to ask you out, it could be a million different reasons. I’d ask him through text if you’re uncomfortable to do it in person. Or ask for another date and ask in person."
weddingshaming,fgr59oy,t3_ezux44,1581038486.0,You definitely accepted a lot more than most. Can’t believe how ridiculous she was.

LongDistance,fgq3p0q,t3_ezr4ih,1581017279.0,"This is tough but you have to choose your priority. Your pets will miss you, but their home and family life will be pretty much the same. Your life will completely change as you get to spend it with the person you love. Enjoy it and you never know, maybe you’ll decide to eventually move back together."
pettyrevenge,fgpxgot,t3_ezke8q,1581013873.0,What a bitch of a sister. Reminds me a lot of mine and just makes me feel angry. If I say no she flips out and threatens our relationship. Everything is always my fault. It’s a pain in the ass when just trying to keep the peace for your family.
raisedbynarcissists,fgpvvvz,t3_ezrd05,1581013016.0,What a cruel bitch. Sorry you had to deal with her. I hope you no longer have to.
childfree,fgpuur3,t3_ezqth1,1581012450.0,"When someone says definitely no, I listen, as should anyone else. Even if you eventually convince them, that seems like a really poor decision especially when it’s involving actual human beings like children.

My fiancé and I are both fence sitters, neither one of us have said definitely no. And we both agreed that if one decides yes we’d go for it. We’ll see what happens."
ThriftStoreHauls,fgpsyyz,t1_fgp5ua1,1581011403.0,If you check out her profile she just has a very negative outlook and opinion about everything. Keep rocking whatever shirt/outfit you want.
AskWomen,fgp5du0,t3_ezkz1y,1580997277.0,I don’t care and more than likely don’t like them either
