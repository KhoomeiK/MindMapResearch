askpsychology,fo758lo,t3_g5yu7k,1587572468.0,"I had a psychotic break a couple years ago. A lot of new things happened at once. I started my dream job at a technology company, started a new antidepressant, met a ton of new people. The job turned out damn near impossible. They gave me three huge projects that not even three people could handle, let alone just me. I started obsessing over doing everything perfectly and what my coworkers thought of me. It was also a remote position so I was always in my house alone.

Paranoia began to creep in a couple months after I started the job. Little things at first. I thought coworkers were trying to hint things at me instead of telling me. I thought my company had plans to lay me off though there was no indication from them they were going to do that. I started thinking they were watching me at home, that they set up cameras and microphones. I whispered instead of talked because I thought they were listening. I ended up taking a spontaneous trip to Montauk because I thought they were giving me hints to lead me there so I could find myself. I did ""find myself"" there, thought I figured out the world. But on the drive home, I freaked the fuck out. Thought they put a camera in my car and I heard them laughing at me. I thought the radio station I was listening to was hijacked by them to teach me lessons.

I voluntarily checked myself into the mental hospital that night. I'm fine now, years later but I often think back and wonder, ""What the fuck was that?"""
