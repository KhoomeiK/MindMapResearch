No shortage (usually) of international students studying on campus at Aussie universities. There are very strict reporting, attendance, and grade requirements though, so you need to be certain you'd be able to maintain the pace. Google some of our universities and see what the programs entail - you could start with Edith Cowan University, Flinders University, University of Tasmania, and Central Queensland University - there's a few others as well.


A couple of things to note though: current second year cohorts (mine included) have been impacted by COVID-19 in that all state ambulance services have cancelled clinical placements this year. This means that this years commencing cohort, and mine, will be at the same point in 2021, potentially creating double the graduates than normal in 2022. 


The second thing is, as has been mentioned re AHPRA registration, statistics released after 1 year showed 7500 students, so there is definitely a lot of us in the system. This isn't to put you off, just to highlight that this is a popular degree. 


One benefit of our degree programs is that they are readily accepted in a lot of countries, so getting your education here and then moving back home, for example, might well put you ahead of the pack. The UK and Canada seem to popular destinations as well.


Finally, go to https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/student-500 if you want o check out details on the student visa. Each uni's website will also have a page outlining options for international students on visas.
