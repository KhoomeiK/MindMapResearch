What I am starting to realize about mindfulness is ironically it’s maybe as much if not more of a physical practice than a mental one in the sense you need to *do* the things to benefit from them. Thinking about them won’t benefit much if at all.

You mentioned looking into wim hof. I highly suggest giving it a try. Or yoga, meditation, or try naming five things you see/five things you hear for a moment... any number of practices. Some of these appear to be mental activities but if you set about doing them, I think that divide becomes less clear. I am starting to think anything that requires your focus is helpful in this way, and if you can work on focusing on body sensations, the payoff is extra high.

Realistically it’s still way too early for me to say for sure it’s completely stopped and I haven’t seen regrowth yet but a week and a half ago when I was still taking a gram or two a day, I could not run my fingers through my hair without about 5 hairs coming out each time. It was like my hairs had given up their grip on my scalp, just sitting there waiting for the slightest thing to carry them off. I also had weird pains and sensations all over my scalp.

To me that is asking for trouble because I know I will have weak moments and even the relatively small built in delay of having to go to the store or go order some is actually helpful at those times. 

I just think, why not set yourself up for success as much as possible? Do you really need to prove to yourself how much you can resist the temptations, or do you want to give yourself your best chance to build up some clean time?

My “reason”/trigger/story I tell myself is this time was an unexpected meeting that popped up and I didn’t want to look or feel off during the video chat. Ugh I’m so disgusted with myself. Before I took that, withdrawal was barely registering. I almost get disappointed at the lack of withdrawals because I can’t use that to justify using. 

By 4 pm I gave into the frustration that I didn’t feel much from the 0.7 (what did I think would happen??) so I took another 1 gram. I’m done for the day and also almost out now. There is maybe 1 gram left in the bottom of the bag. I should just throw it away. I’m telling myself I’m keeping it as an emergency in case I finally finally *finally* get to day 3 and that’s when bad withdrawals suddenly kick in. I don’t believe my own bs though. More likely I will take it tomorrow when I’m having a hard time getting work done and I get the hint of a withdrawal symptom, which will set me up to start justifying buying more. 

I must somehow prevent myself buying more. I’m so damn tired of this game I play endlessly with myself, it is so draining and disheartening. I almost want to call the local smoke shops and ask them not to sell to me lol"

I feel optimistic about finally ct tomorrow, but I’ve been saying that for over six weeks! 

I thank goodness for this place, I reorient and remind  myself by coming here several times a day, and I’m not giving up.

Im going to remind myself tomorrow ad nauseum: I know nothing will ever get any better for me with kratom. I will write it in my journal a million times. Even if I get no work done, it’s better than taking kratom. Even if I lose my freaking job (please god, no) that is STILL better than taking kratom. For real nothing is worth it anymore. The stakes are that high for me."
quittingkratom,fnc3afn,t3_g0ugcl,1586827711.0,"You question “is being on this any different than being dependent on any other medication”- really spoke to me. This is exactly the kind of rational and justification my addict mind uses to convince something is ok that I know for sure is definitely not ok. 

If you read this sub you will see a LOT of people talk about feeling depressed, sometimes for a while, after newly getting off a kratom addiction. 

You have gone a week without- that is itself amazing, I hope you are duly proud. At the same time, a week is a relatively short time after 4 months of daily use. Right now your addicted brain and body which is at real threat of vanquishment is screaming at you to take kratom, and it’s good at thinking of reasons. I actually really like the one yours came up with and my brain went - yeah, who’s to say kratom is any worse than some pharmaceutical. So what if I need to function? *Lots* of people need meds to function! 

But whether or not kratom is like “being dependent on any other med” is not the point. You decided to stop taking it for good reasons. You were able to recognize signs of addiction and take action. 

I really wish I could say I had been able to go a week without. I keep on listening to asinine reasoning of my addiction and I don’t get far. Please don’t be like me and keep doing what you’re doing! You’re bound to feel better, probably pretty soon too. 

One thing can be sure, kratom is not the answer. You have come so far and you may turn that corner at any moment so please don’t give up yet."

That is awesome to me that you are making that choice to “deal with the discs” rather than continue being physically dependent on pills.

I slice my day up by hours, and each hour feels like days, but I usually know I can get through one hour without using. Sometimes I have to break it down even smaller, to the minute. I ask myself, can you get through the next minute without using? If the answer is no, I break it down even more so that I’m just counting my breaths through what feel like endless seconds.

If I get through a few minutes of this, I heartily congratulate myself :) in your case you deserve a HUGE congratulations. 6 days!!! That is a LOT of seconds. I hope to get there by the end of the week but honestly don’t know. I’m trying for three days right now and it is daunting."

Have you looked at the guide in this sub on using kratom to get off other opiates? It recommends getting two greens and two reds and alternating. Green during the day and red for sleep.

In my case though I just used greens and they certainly did their job.

I highly recommend taking a peak at that guide. It really helped me get through those first very difficult days."

Phryne looked cute (shudder to think) in every scene but this was a *movie* - I was hoping for *extreme* glamour but we really got sort of a cute office casual look 

On the other hand, I thought there was some real gorgeousness afoot especially in some of the interior scenes. I felt visually exhilarated a couple times- early in the film when phryne toasts Khalil and Shirin entering the red carpeted room at the lofty house, and another when Khalil joins - I think it was lady Eleanor at the window more towards the end. That one reminded me of a scene from the downton Abby movie that had a similar effect on me- an interior shot of an arch shaped window on a starry night- ah I swoon lol."

And I’ll just have the same unfulfilling life, just maybe with more hair lol. 

You are at almost two months. I think a lot of people relapse at this point because the challenges get harder in some ways, if you want to keep moving forward. 

But staying stuck is still better than sinking fast, I think, because you still have hope that things will get better, that you’ll find some way to improve your situation. Whereas if you go back to taking kratom, that hope is immediately diminished."

quittingkratom,fla1jee,t3_fnfq6f,1584974566.0,"Day 23 of taper. Not where I hoped I would be by now. The fact I am willing to keep taking kratom despite the consequences is utterly baffling to me. I have cut back dramatically, but of course I often find myself wanting a little more, and this morning I took 4 grams, instead of 3, because I wanted to numb some difficult feelings. 

It worked a little bit, I guess. I’m recently broken up from a long relationship, and yesterday we talked and it was particularly hard. This morning I woke up still thinking about it and I just wanted to shut that voice off so I went running to kratom.

I don’t want hard days to defeat me like this. I want to feel strong and prove to myself I am strong by stringing together some number of days - even though it IS hard. That makes it worth more anyway right. 

I am so grateful  to be able to share here. I already feel in a better headspace, just having written that out. In order to stick with this taper, I need to take less than 3.5 grams the rest of the day. Physically I know it will be easy, it’s the mental part that gets me every time, my ability to convince myself it’s ok to take a little more. 

I have to resist using again until at 4 pm. I will come up with many many reasons to use. None of them make sense. I have to focus on work- and no kratom won’t help me focus on work or do my job better.

I want to stop believing all the damn lies I tell myself, just to take more kratom-!"

I’ve had similar thoughts as far as could my kratom use have affected me in some way or made me vulnerable? Has it affected my hormones or immune system?

Many of my days were marked by checking transit status obsessively. A Good day would be when package comes early, and so many bad days when a package is delayed. Part of the reason I made the switch to kratom was to avoid this happening. There are like a dozen tobacco stores within 10 miles of me selling good quality kratom, so I really don’t have to worry about being stuck without it. I’m sorry that’s not the case where you are. It sounds like this is one of the first times this is happening to you and I have to warn you that generally, it is a pretty common occurrence. You will likely notice it more the more often you order."
poppyseed,fk3pwp4,t1_fk0ibkj,1583842969.0,"Like you I was so worried about withdrawals but what I imagined was worse than what it was and I realize now that worrying made it so much worse. I tried to take the stance of a scientist and observe, rather than identify with the withdrawal sensations. I also followed the guide on the kratom sub called “from opiates to kratom”- it is almost hour by hour for the first couple days and I found it enormously helpful to follow for the first couple days. 

I only wish I had adhered more closely because it also guides you to taper off the kratom- instead of picking up a kratom habit which is where I am now. There is a similar guide on the quitting kratom sub which is also really helpful. 

Re reading my post earlier I sound very cavalier about it all, but it’s enormously hard, more so mentally than physically really. It’s not about completely avoiding any withdrawals so much as making them tolerable so you can get through them. There is a lot of support to be had all around reddit, if you have someone irl to talk to that is also really helpful, and feel free to pm me if you like. 

Good luck to you, if there’s anything I’ve learned it’s that for the most part we are all much stronger than we tend to think."
PoppyTea,fjtib0w,t3_fezlwo,1583608036.0,"In my experience, and based on what I’ve learned from others, it will definitely lessen the blow from coming straight off seeds. Since you’ve already been switching back and forth it should be that much easier for you to make the first transition at least. Some good advice is just take enough kratom to not feel too bad, don’t try to get a high from it"
poppyseed,fjsbhh0,t1_fj6u780,1583595408.0,"Tapering for a few years?? Man I would try a different method if you’re serious about stopping. An endless taper sounds like the worst of both worlds to me. I switched from seeds to kratom with maybe one or two slightly uncomfortable days. Now I’m coming off kratom with barely a sneeze. 
I was a heavy seed user for 5 years. In my case I was able to stop without too much withdrawals- but that’s only half the story. You may find as I did that the longer you have used, you will have to pay the price so to speak in one way or another. It might be emotional, relationships you have neglected, or financial, or changes to your health. I don’t know your story but I think years of use rarely comes with a zero price tag."

But I said today’s as the day, and I don’t want to go back on that. The shame factor will be exponential if I break down and use. I know that a whole day without taking anything will be a loooong one for me, but I will fight the thoughts of using as they come up, one at a time. I’m really kind of excited at the thought of having one day. 60 days is amazing, I’m glad you’re able to appreciate the strength and determination that you proved you have in order to get there."

Today was a lot easier than I thought it would be as far as withdrawals. Today was the first time in as long as I can remember, at least 5 years, that I ate breakfast without dosing opiate or kratom first.

Maybe a month into taking it (relatively high doses) I really noticed hair falling out at an exceedingly fast rate. My hair was already thin, and in my case I think under eating, itself exacerbated by my opiate abuse, wasn’t helping things, and I have been eating even less on kratom than I was on the other opiate. 

Now I have found a bald patch. I had heard about the hair loss being a potential risk of kratom - but if there is a connection/causation, it certainly doesn’t affect everyone. Maybe some of us are more sensitive.

I am hoping kratom is a trigger at least in my case. I guess the only way to know for sure is to completely stop taking it and see if that helps."
