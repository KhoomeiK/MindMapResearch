bipolar,fqoyv3u,t1_fqnjdm8,1589529137.0,"Hello! My psychiatrist appointment lasted an hour long. Since Teladoc is handled through my insurance, they have all of my medical records and the doctor asked for a quick identification verification. Prior to this appointment, I hadn’t seen a pdoc in years. My last psychiatrist was rude and condescending. This new psychiatrist was very kind and attentive. Since it was my first visit, it’s much too soon for an official diagnosis, but I’m confident that he will help me get my mental health on track. As for my medication, it’s still too soon to tell how they’re helping, but so far it’s going alright. I’ve been more energetic and I’m not feeling too depressed, so it’s progress!"
Anxiety,fqbuutl,t3_ghiqy2,1589244369.0,Always :( I feel like everyone only pretends to be nice or tolerate me but actually hate me deep down inside.

LongDistance,fm471hh,t3_fsu91d,1585748043.0,"Uncertainty in an LDR is extremely challenging. I personally like to look forward to plans that we have made when we visit each other, but now everything seems to be put on hold. :( this is all so surreal, it’s always been one of my worst fears that I would have no way to get to him. I’m still hopeful that I will be able to see him in June, but I’m still incredibly sad that I might not 😔"
CasualUK,fm2l7v6,t3_fscrhf,1585699765.0,Congrats! I’ve been on 20mg of escitalopram for over a year now and still need the help. I hope to one day find myself taking my last one.

LongDistance,flliiv8,t3_fphko0,1585261000.0,"I totally understand you. This really sucks and I hope that this gets better soon for everyone’s sake. I’ve vented to my mom and friends about how I feel during these times and all I ever hear is “think about others who have it way worse than you” yea, but my feelings are valid as well and so are yours and everyone else’s. I am supposed to get married to my fiancé this year in June so that we could start with my visa process to move to the UK, but our timelines are so uncertain now :( all we can do is take things day by day and do what we can on our end to help eradicate this virus. Stay strong!"

So sorry to hear that you’re being laid off :( I hope you are able to find something soon! Check in with your local grocery stores and see if they need any extra help!"
Coronavirus,fl2b68y,t1_fl1xdu2,1584747016.0,"We are all taught that working in a grocery store or “flipping patties at McDonald’s” isn’t a “real job”. All jobs are important! Right now, the food industry is a top priority. Whether you work in a restaurant, grocery store, a warehouse, a truck, we ALL matter! I’ve been in search of a higher paying job for a few years and have had no luck. I have an associates in English, but still work at minimum wage in a grocery store. Today, I am feeling grateful that I’m still able to work and earn money. Even though I’m not where I want to be in life at the moment, this is where I need to be and I’m grateful."
Coronavirus,fl29ij9,t1_fl1wpw7,1584745959.0,"We appreciate people like you :) I work in a grocery store and had several customers thank me and my coworkers for being open and stocking the shelves. There have also been a fair share of entitled jerks who huff and puff about things missing, so when we hear someone come up to us and thank us, it definitely makes our days a little brighter. These are hard times for everyone, but we won’t make anything any better by being rude or aggressive. As difficult as it may be for some people, staying calm and being patient with one another helps immensely. Keep on thanking your grocery store clerks, because most of us only get paid minimum wage. :("
LongDistance,fkzqw13,t3_flef8p,1584677776.0,That’s beautiful!!! Congrats!! I also have an opal engagement ring (he proposed in October& October is my birthday and opal is my birthstone! He says he didn’t know though 🙄) lol
CoronavirusUS,fkrnwuu,t3_fjs7ju,1584472550.0,"Thank you for this. I’ve been working at the same grocery store for nearly 3 years at a minimum wage income... My coworkers and I are working our asses off and management hasn’t once told us a simple “thank you”. I understand that they are busy too, but we are underpaid and overworked with rude customers coming in and cleaning our shelves off unnecessarily. I’m worried about getting sick because I’m working paycheck to paycheck, as are my coworkers, and we can’t afford to not work at the moment."

90DayFiance,fhzc3sq,t3_f5jxfh,1581995733.0,I’m so glad I wasn’t the only one thinking that they were being too much. I live in Southern California + am introverted and when Everett said that California will swallow you up if you aren’t outgoing lmaoo. His friends like to party and have completely different interests and personalities than Jasmin. She’s an introverted European girl and she definitely doesn’t have to “become outgoing” for anyone. They’re shit friends.
