It's really scary and I'm worried that even if I take her to the er the results will be same, and she honestly has no money (neither do i) and I'll have to beg my parents for it... D:"

No problem, pee is all inside, my bladder exhales a sigh of relief, go to sleep.



Problem was that I was on my period. Tomorrow morning I was greeted with a piss bottle... with reddish brown blood all sunken underneath like contaminated agar jelly.
