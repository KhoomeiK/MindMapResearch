It's been my experience(both from teaching and observing others teach), that java is generally received more easily by students.  Perhaps that's because my day job is working with java so I have a bias toward that community, r perhaps it's because java is truly easier to learn.

I'm not here to nitpick the languages, because they're functionally equivalent as far as a vast majority of FRC is concerned.  My advice to teams is to always use whatever their mentors can support.

I've seen many confrontational decisions be made, even involving the laravel/laravel boilerplate project.  But I've never seen anyone with your complaints.

Laravel is a very opinionated framework in a lot of ways.  If you don't like that, you're under no obligation to use it.  But out of all the PHP frameworks I've tried to work with (CakePHP, Yii2, Symfony, Zend, etc), I've found Laravel to be the easiest to get started with, best documented, and most welcoming community.

Other comments have already explained how to trim down the boilerplate project to the absolute bare minimums, but almost all of that stuff you'd trim out is inconsequential.  Leaving it in has minimal impact on your project, and the stuff that would impact your app are either files you'll definitely have to touch when building it, or quite obvious that it can be deleted without harm."

BLS vs ALS is very much related to the level of certification of the people staffing it. But is also restricted by the equipment capabilities of the vehicle as well.

For example, 2 paramedics (ALS providers) can staff a ""BLS"" ambulance due to a lack of ALS equipment, but 2 EMTs (BLS providers) cannot staff an ""ALS"" ambulance.  Instead, they're staffing a BLS ambulance that may just happen to have ALS supplies on board.

rit,ewgi9ws,t1_ewfrj6s,1565382461.0,"Well damn.... I think I may have been thinking of the ""quarter"" price, not semester, but still, 2100*1.5 != 5000... even after reasonable CoL increases...

20k for an apartment for ~4 months is freaking highway robbery...."
rit,ewfarhr,t1_ewe9ibt,1565356133.0,"That... seems off.

Granted it was a few years ago, but when I was there, perkins was ~1500/semester, dorms were ~2000, and UC was ~2100.  I expect the rates when up, but not 200%... are you sure it's not 5000/year?"

laravel,ew2mnds,t3_cm7i4j,1565050555.0,"I'm honestly a little disappointed with the post.  As others have already pointed out, Voyager is virtually disconnected from TheControlGroup, only being connected by name at this point.  /u/devdojo is the original creator, and has been mostly hands-off for the last couple years, allowing me and the other couple maintainers run with it.  He and the rest of TCG have never attempted to exert authority over the project in any way, negative or otherwise, so we're very much free and open source.  As others have said, free as in beer, AND free as in open.

Tony left a very thoughtful post a few hours ago, so I'll defer to that for any further comments."
