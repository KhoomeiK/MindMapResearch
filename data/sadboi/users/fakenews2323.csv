Your better off contesting all shots than playing mind games that allow them to score even if it is just a few points. Bill Russel guarded in an era of simple basketball.

Before Mayweather canelo had no real high level opponents unless you want to count a 40 year old in decline Shane Mosley a worthy opponent, which he wasnt. Just watching him fight then in comparison to now you can see how much skill he lacked back then. At 154 i still think it would be a very close fight with canelo winning. But that's just my opinion."
Boxing,fm0xzj4,t1_fm0n8fu,1585668366.0,"I think canelo would beat floyd, he has improved his hips, footwork, and finally became aggressive after fighting GGG. He is in his prime, he was a bum when he fought Mayweather. All hype, he was flatfooted, was not aggressive and overall sucked. I'm Mexican and I wanted GGG to beat his ass cuz he was an overhyped boxer and that was years after the Mayweather fight. But after that second fight he greatly improved, GGG jab is great and has more power than Mayweather's, and canelo overcame that, plus Mayweather can't knock him out cuz he doesn't have the power. It would just be a matter of canelo landing punches to win in points, since I seriously doubt he could knock out Mayweather. Let's remember Mayweather looked for fighters after or before their prime, he's skilled but he ain't undefeatable."

Just remember that being fearful of a disease sets in a negative mindset, that already decreases your chance of survival, if we all feared everything that had a 1% chance of killing us no one would leave their homes. As you stated, it kills older people with weaker immune systems, that applies with most disease. Most people wouldn't need to go to the doctor if they catch this, the symptoms are mild and similar to the flu.

Blackfellas,fk3kmgn,t1_fk3jom4,1583837743.0,"Well would you blame a person for what society has ingraved in his mind as what is beautiful and attractive? Like some people just have shade preferences, where race isn't the factor. Every race has different shades of color, like me and my homie had a conversation about this a few years back. He said he is attracted to black women like a young Tyra banks, but he doesn't find very dark women attractive. You could say this is due to the negative perception the media has forced upon us when it comes to darker skinned individuals in society. Does that make him racist? I would say it doesn't, since he does find black women attractive, just not all shades of black women. So unattraction to a race or shade could be caused by psychological issues from the nurture side of nature/nurture. I think this is too complicated a subject to answer with a simple yes or no. Human beings and our brains are so complex and unique to each individual that figuring out why we don't like something is very difficult."

Yes things change, but understand that since Europe conquered most of the world they left traces of their narrow minded ideas scattered throughout these countries. Racism is persistent throughout the world because of this, not a good change I would say. So when you say keep your culture, well that's kinda hard when a country forces you to assimilate and give up your culture completely. The US had policies and programs in place to try and force native Americans to give up their culture and fully assimilate.

It's the skill and artistic ability we look at, remember Drake had ghost writers, so he didn't write most of his music, that's half the job right there. Is he as good as an artist like ice cube whom wrote all his lyrics and started the gangsta rap genre? Ofcourse not. Making you feel hyped or happy is so much easier for an artist to do than making you critically think about issues in the world or telling a story so detailed you can see it with your eyes closed as you listen along. Not to say that that type of music sucks, but im just saying comparing ice cube, slick Rick, and Nas, to lil Nas x, da baby and other purely ""catchy"" rappers is a bit disrespectful to the artists that pour their heart and soul into their songs."
