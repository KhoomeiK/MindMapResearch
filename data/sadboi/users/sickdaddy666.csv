illnessfakersgonewild,fqwrhwu,t1_fqw9zt2,1589715172.0,"Thank you so much. Its truly sad because even until the end, my friend fought to be as independent and normal as possible: she earned two bachelor's degrees, insisted on living in her own apartment despite needing quite a bit of assistance, participated in raising awareness directly with the EB foundation but never through a performative sickstagram where she made it all about her, etc. she was just a normal woman who happened to have a very cruel set of cards handed to her.

meanwhile these munchies love being babied + revel in their dependence on caregivers, bragging that they cant do shit by themselves and have a parent or husband that wipes their 30 year old asses for them, and treat their sickstagrams like theyre vital to ""spreading awareness"". It's sickening and differs completely from really sick folks. And I completely get how you feel, them claiming deadly illnesses like that is a totally different level of offensive. Thank you for all that you do as a physician btw, i really appreciate your analysis on kelly!"

Her doctors had given her a life expectancy of 9 to 10 years old, and by the time she had passed she didnt have any fingers or toes b/c of the EB and was in excruciating pain. EB looks NOTHING like what Kelly has and its insulting to me that'd she'd even attempt to claim such a cruel and merciless illness. it didnt present as individual wounds like Kelly's, it was just all over, so what youve said is correct"

People commit suicide from the unbearable pain as you said, meanwhile SGB just has her daddy make a phone call and its problem solved.

I'm so sorry that youve had such a rough go finding a regimen that works.. the trial and error is so time consuming and stressful, its so hard to find a pain regimen that provides adequate relief. I hope that your current trial of the combo works well enough that it can become your regular pain management regimen! Its amazing that the LDN in combination with it has significantly reduced your opioid needs. I completely agree that there are things that can be done in order to control patients' pain while also making sure there isnt addiction at play. And no need to say sorry at all, i appreciate your perspective and insight from personal experience. Also youve helped me quite a bit because now I think i may have to ask my pain doctor if this would be an option for me since LDN wasnt working on its own, so thank you. Anyway sorry for writing a novel as a response but thank you again for educating me and im wishing you the best of luck with your pain management!"

illnessfakersgonewild,fpn8a32,t1_fpmvpjk,1588753689.0,"thats the thing tho, getting them on a medication that works is the hardest part lmfao. If it were easy then ibd treatment and pain management wouldnt be as complex as it is so. Prednisone is not meant to be a long term solution for IBD nor is it a good solution and can cause a whole slew of problems: osteoporosis, tooth decay, adrenal insuffiency, etc. Other non opioid pain management options thatre suggested as alternatives to opioids (like Lyrica, Gabapentin, Ketamine, etc) are also addictive! Using opiates for pain management during an acute pain flare isnt really a huge issue altho i agree that its not viable for long term management; chronic pain doesnt mean there wont be acute pain situations that may require a brief period of opioid use. Also biologics dont always work, 5-ASAs work best for mild to moderate colitis, some biologics are completely out of the question for a lot of ppl bc if youre allergic to anti TNFs then that pretty much reduces your medication options to about half/less than half, theres the potential to build antibodies to biologics, most biologic trials have mediocre rates of success for IBD at best and even lower success for crohns specifically compared to colitis, some ppl can only afford biosimilars instead which arent always as effective, etc etc etc. I get where youre coming from but lets not oversimplify the issue either."

illnessfakersgonewild,fpj1tj0,t3_gdo21u,1588654246.0,"I think the reason they dont mind waiting however long it takes to get triaged/receive ""care"", the stench and crying of other patients, the process of getting an IV, etc, is bc the drugs and/or asspats they get from being admitted are worth much more than the effort it takes to be there. Plus its not like theyd be in danger from waiting too long to receive care/fluids/etc. Unlike people with real medical emergencies who quite literally cannot wait bc of the urgency. they have no problem ignoring the shittiness of going to the ER bc they get ""care"" in return, and its also why they throw tantrums when they ""don't receive care"". not receiving care frustrates them bc it means all their attentionwhoring and 12/10 pain-faking was just wasted time
