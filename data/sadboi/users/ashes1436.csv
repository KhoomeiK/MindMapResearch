energy_work,fpcp6px,t3_gcodkl,1588508620.0,"I'm not sure if it relates to you, but my best advice is to drink water and pay attention to where your food is obtained from (if you eat animals). It may also be something you are picking up from outside yourself. It may be a good idea to exercise and eat chocolate or something that feels similar while you get through this. You may also try grounding the energy or transmuting it through your own body by simply feeling it and trying to turn it into something more positive. Even if you cannot change it, I believe feeling the feeling can be a good experience for the observer. It is a unique experience to feel anger. It is okay if we don't act on it. Meditation and mindful activities (being in the present) can help with control over actions."
