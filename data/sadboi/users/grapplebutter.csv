EDAnonymous,fnqqmzd,t3_g3e12k,1587170094.0,i feel u i just stole a sleeve of ritz crackers from my younger brothers room and ate it all in one sitting😍 hated every bite. honestly feeling pretty shitty right now but the best thing to do would be to forgive urself and move on. quarantine is already stressful so don’t be too hard on ur body for how it tries to cope :)

EatingDisorders,fnob1lr,t3_g2z40o,1587118870.0,"could he be eating more for dinner/the night before? if he is it would make sense for him to not be as hungry when he wakes up. i get what you mean by feeling embarrassed in his presence though, i hate having to admit that i’m hungry before anyone else does, feels like i’m “giving in”. but these thoughts honestly make no sense and you shouldn’t feel bad for your body needing energy!! you deserve to follow your body’s natural signals and eat a nourishing breakfast, because it’s about following what your body wants, not the people around you."

EDAnonymous,fno9wft,t3_g2ypal,1587117636.0,"yea i totally get that, being afraid of eating normally and binging. sometimes i’m ok with maintaining and i’m not actively trying to lose weight but i still feel like i have to be super careful around food so i don’t mess up and start going out of control. it doesn’t make ur feelings any less valid tho, cuz at the end of the day an ed is having a disordered relationship with food, and healthy people definitely don’t worry abt stuff like this."

BingeEatingDisorder,fjmrkva,t3_fe7joi,1583480840.0,"same!!! i literally come home from school and binge just because i’m too scared to actually start my homework, and i just end up feeling bloated and wanting to do it even less. it also got rly bad for me this feb and the weight gain is making me even less motivated to do better. i’ve recently started journaling to try to track my patterns though, so i’ll try to write whenever possible either about how i’m feeling or what i ate, or just documenting whenever i get binge urges and what i’m feeling in the moment. i guess i’m just trying to understand what drives me to do stuff and i’ll try to make changes from there? but i usually find that just being more in control by documenting everything helps me control my eating in the long run"

EDAnonymous,fiscjcw,t3_f9kxhs,1582682229.0,"i do the same thing and i tried to think about it like a challenge or a game; how long can i go without body checking. kinda like when ur on a run, you see how much longer you can go. since i always bodycheck after i go to the bathroom, in that moment i’ll be like “ok if i don’t look at my stomach this time that’ll be two times in a row, let’s see how long i can keep this up”. i think the hardest part is staying present in that moment and remembering not to bodycheck since it becomes a subconscious thing"
BingeEatingDisorder,fi6tvxb,t1_fi1s6ie,1582207277.0,"i’m so happy you’re reaching out to get help!! if you haven’t already heard of it, the podcast brain over binge could be useful, or maybe your local library has books dealing with overeating. it’s wishing the best for you <3"
BingeEatingDisorder,fhrt71t,t3_f4jhv3,1581837730.0,"made an account to comment since i relate to this so much.. especially not being able to do anything until the fullness goes away. reminds me of a quote from a book “there are more important things to think about than how full or empty i feel”. but yea, there’s so much shame that comes with this disorder and it can be really heavy at times."
