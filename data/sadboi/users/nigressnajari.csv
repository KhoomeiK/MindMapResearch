Being in an unfamiliar environment while hallucinating 20 hours a day was very stressful to put it lightly.  I had struggles showing up to classes, but luckily still managed to pull a 3.8 GPA.  I was supposed to take 5 classes per semester, but the classes that had mandatory attendance I'd usually drop.  I averaged about 3 classes per semester.  This next semester I will be taking a full course load as I finally found a medication combination that suits me mentally."

It's personal information that I can choose to share with a girl whenever I'm comfortable.  I dont have to lead a conversation with it.

This led to years of insomnia that I still haven't fully dealt with.  The hallucinations and the social isolation that tags along with them has caused me to drift apart from many friends.  I was hospitalized once, and medication quickly followed.  Since then I've gone through many medication changes, and I have finally found a combination that works for me.

I never told anyone about it but the voices would tell me all of the answers that I had seen while studying.  It was like I was cheating but I wasnt.  Schizophrenia can be a gift if you correct the negative thought patterns involved by retraining your brain through operant conditioning.  It's believed that Nikola Tesla had it which is how he so vividly pictured his inventions before even sketching them."
