bipolar,ffy2eyx,t1_ffy0qap,1580337265.0,Thank you as always! This is a older painting always bothered me and I never varnished it. Decided to add 4 more layers on top of what I had already. And said it’s good enough. That is definitely the hardest part to accept for me doing art! Thanks so much!
bipolar,ffy236w,t1_ffy0imi,1580337062.0,Thank you very much! I love space!
bipolar,feivlh3,t3_epdzgx,1579148413.0,Sorry to hear about this. Divorce is a nightmare for kids. And unfortunately sides get created or assumed a certain way. Walking the tightrope between your parents and how they perceive things is hard. I wish you all the best and hope things can be healed some day soon! Take care!
bipolar,feiufvv,t3_epc8ur,1579147513.0,Looks good! What materials did you use for this? Art is very subjective and you can’t please everyone! Take care!

bipolar,fefsvvb,t1_fefeze5,1579064195.0,No worries you will find it! I am only 3 or so years into making art. It’s definitely been interesting and very rewarding. Just do what you feel and express yourself! All the best!

bipolarart,fecs4sf,t1_fecm75r,1578982527.0,Thank you so much! Would be nice to have a place big enough for that size canvas! Smaller painting room = Paint EVERYWHERE
bipolar,feckctv,t1_fechhms,1578976029.0,Thank you very much! Glad it works for you! My uncle is the only person who has seen the progression of layers. Helps to get outside opinions/critiques! Thanks for commenting!

AbstractArt,fds3cl0,t1_fdrxfyf,1578693687.0,Ok thanks for the feedback! I can diminish it and make it smaller. I would never steal art and claim it was mine but unfortunately it’s not a problem for some folks. All the best! Thanks again!
bipolar,fdr4i0c,t1_fdqv2vx,1578679338.0,Thank you very much! I was stuck on what to do with this painting. Probably 4 layers under the splatter part. Forced myself to stick with similar colors on the splatter layers. Glad you like it! Thanks again!

bipolar,fb63m3s,t3_ebm1g6,1576540543.0,Amazing as always! How long did it take you to complete? Was up doing art until 5am today. Went back later and didn’t do any art besides look around my painting room! Take care and fantastic job on the artwork!
learnart,fb4hzl1,t1_fb4fn9q,1576509323.0,No problem! I appreciate talented people! The guy I learned this method from charges 50 or more depending on canvas size and thickness. Also subject matter / commissions more. So I started around 40 and only recently got into 50 multiplier. What surface do you do these on? How much do you normally charge for 24” x 36” or 16”x 20” size piece? Thanks
learnart,fb4djtb,t3_ebetjq,1576506865.0,"You are very talented! How big is the giraffe piece? I started doing Art 3 years ago. First painting hooked me instantly! But I can’t do amazing realistic art! Have sold 30+ various sized abstracts, mainly to friends and family. How I price is  ( W+L inches total /12=? X your multiplier of choice). Mine is 50+ on some and other old ones lower but not substantially. 

Example: 20+24=44/12=3.66 X 50=$183.33   


For me that would be $183.99 or $189.99 painting. But I am thankful and appreciative of my support and give LOVE U rates for them. 


Hope this helps some but I am only a 3 year old amateur artist!

All the best!"

bipolar,f71u2p2,t3_du4hcc,1573348173.0,Congratulations! It’s a big step when you decide on putting yourself and artwork out there. Took me over a year and half before letting most people see my art. It’s extremely difficult when you are overly hard on yourself and don’t believe in your abilities. The first and only painting that I sold on Etsy was also my first sale by someone that didn’t know me. It meant the world! I believe in you and wish you the best! Take care!
