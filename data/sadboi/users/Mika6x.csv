sextips,f5tufvm,t3_doyrq6,1572464464.0,"It takes a lot of relaxation combined with a little concentration for a lot of women- myself included- and I had to attempt to give my fiancé pointers on giving me oral and basically- some women need their clit stimulated while also being fingered, others don’t like the penetrating aspect. A decent amount of saliva, writing your abcs with your tongue, sucking the clit a little bit, licking from the opening of her vagina all the way to her clit and then flicking your tongue back and forth a few times on her clit and a flat tongue with pressure can do the trick. Try putting a pillow under her hips for a better angle and don’t be afraid to tweak her nipples too. Good luck! And don’t feel bad, we’re hard to get across the finish line sometimes but you’re looking for advice which means you care so bonus points for not being ‘I finished idc if she does’!"
AskWomen,f57fvd8,t3_dms4r9,1572035480.0,"I’m 21 and reading all of these comments on upbringing and standards makes me so angry for you all. I was raised by a single father with a heavy hand- but he never let someone treat me like a girl- I was a human, I was equal to his friends sons. I never wanted to have a daughter for fear of society regressing and her light being squandered- now I have a very head strong opinionated intelligent little 3 year old girl who is going to take this world by storm and be damned who ever tells her otherwise. The changes the women of my generation will make and the seas we will part are in your generations honor- I’m so sorry you were all so repressed and thank you!! For raising your daughters to be head strong and fearless"

It wasn’t always like this so I’m hoping this phase will pass and I can be enough and he can realize what he has. Doesn’t entirely help much that I tend to dress like a sack of potatoes and not talk when I’m upset which has been pretty often lately. Plus I think now that I had our second- but his first time seeing a birth and a nursing mother- he sees me as a mom doing a great thing for her child, and not so much anything else. Not sure how to fix that part"

It does seem creepy I mean I know the girls who post them want that attention but honestly if I’m trying to get his attention and he’d rather look at that then wtf am I even doing? And like saving stuff so it’s a specific girl not just a random one he stumbles across on pornhub for the minute he’s there. From what I’ve gotten on this post apparently I’m attractive and it kinda blows that strangers tell me that more than the man I’m supposed to marry.

relationship_advice,f33dyxz,t3_dffk5q,1570636811.0,"I was in a similar situation- he did things like that often and it would escalate each time. I left, spent time at my parents and went back..he loved on me all day the day I went back, bought me food, a dress, cuddled me told me he was sorry and loved me. That night he beat me so bad he broke my tailbone and gave me a concussion. Moral of the story- DO NOT go back. It will never get better, only worse. So please do not go back. Fight yourself when you feel like texting him back or going to see him. It will not end well"

antipornography,f2jpdok,t3_dd8bgo,1570275799.0,"This happens to me a lot- tho I wish my fiancé could let porn go but that’s never going to happen- where I’ll find something he used to watch or save and I’m like damn..I can’t compete with that. And I’ll get upset even if it was before we got together because he tells me he likes girls shaped like me but then everything I see is faarrr from it. Honestly yes you have a right to feel upset, it’s a self esteem thing- but also keep reminding yourself that he loves you, he’s apologizing, he feels bad about it, and most men wouldn’t ever get rid of their porn for their girl friends so that’s amazing. It’ll take time for the sting to go away, but you guys seem like you have a super honest relationship and can communicate well which is amazing! Keep talking, and when he compliments you, try your hardest to take it to heart and know that he really does feel that way"
