It was ok with me untill 2008, when I saw HeadHunterz on Qlimax, playing his own songs. I said, I will be there one day. Now, I don't do hardstyle, I do Techno, Tech and Technouse, sometimes psytrance... whatever is the feel. And I learned music theory by myself. I am producer for 5 years. And now I'm grasping piano. Very hard proces when no one can show you. So you learn it by yourself. At the end of the day it doesn't matter how hard you can hit. It matters how hard you can GET kicked and keep moving forward. There is only goal. Nothing else. I do everything to become closer to my goal. In some times I just want to make myself into a ball and just lie around... that is ok, but again.

I couldnt smoke fast enough to smoke all my stash. Everything goes by the record speed. Job was going well, I had money, and then I tried Cocaine. I tried it before, but it wasn't nothing. After that I started consuming cocaine daily, and upping the dosages. I was at point. If I snort ____ this big line of coke, then I must go for another 5 or 10 grams. It was ruining me. Especially the cocaine. Cocaine is destruction of your life, wallet, and everything."
casualiama,fizsysn,t1_fizsh6x,1582873434.0,"Legalizing certain substances can make market more controlled. When you're meeting in a dark corner for 2KG of weed, you don't know what it is until you test it. And that is roll one up. Few months back, i found out that one of my dealers was killed and dit hed under the bridge. I started to investigate, since I knew his circle of people. He would spray bad weed with pesticides or some shit... WD40... a lot of bad stuff. And suddenly his weed is kicking... so if it were controlled, there would be fewer addicts, because, you see, in this case, people don't care what YOU will place in you. He sold everything he could. But eventually someone popped him... 
Addiction is sort of a mental prison. You can do what you want. Only when youre high. If you are sober... tough luck. You become angry, depressed.... you need it now. I would say it's a disease, because when I was an addict. I just needed the right person with me. My current girlfriend. She got me sober. Do I trust the fda? Yes and no, depending on the question"

Keep on movin'
Flyin'
Stop your cryin'
Choosin'

Music is the answer
To your problems
Keep on movin'
Then you can solve them

If you feel that you can't take no more
And your feet are headed for the door

Gotta keep on dancin'

Groovin'
Keep on movin'

Stop your cryin'

So you get that urge to spill someones blood. Thoughts about looking your oponent in the eyes while gutting him. Choking him untill his eyes pop. Or just random beating till the death. This was my brain. I couldn't controll it. We sit on a coffe and talk normally, but in my head, Im counting with how many ways I can end your life with common things found anywhere. For some time, I also thought that that were my thoughts. But I went to my local priest. And told him that I have very black thoughts. Explained it to him. He told me that satan can put certain thought in your head. And if you don't know how to battle with someone you cant catch or see. You need to  take control over your thoughts. You need to put 2 baskets. 1 is for my thoughts and 2 is for devils thoughts. And when you start to learn the difference between devils thought and your thought. The devil can throw anything at you, but you alredy know that that aint your thoughts. This helped for me"
