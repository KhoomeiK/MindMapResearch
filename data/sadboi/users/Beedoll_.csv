lonely,ficpo18,t1_ficogi2,1582353832.0,"SAME!!!! Only thing is I don’t consider my coworkers as my friends. I literally don’t have anything in common with them because I’m the youngest  and when I try to have conversations with them, they give me like this weird look. So...I literally don’t have any friends at all."
lonely,fico03u,t3_f77ts3,1582352914.0,Wow. I’m a 21F and this is literally my life.
depression,ffjevrb,t3_etxz3p,1579996788.0,"I can relate. I endured a lot of verbal, emotional, and mental abuse from my dad’s ex-wife and my mother. I was always told that I’m a liar just like my father. On my mother’s side, there are four of us. I’m the only daughter with 3 brothers. She treated my two youngest brothers better than she did with me and my other brother. Like you, my mother never got out of the bed unless she had to work ( for two days) or go on dates. I wouldn’t see her until the next day. There were times that I would starve myself and planned to commit suicide because of all the pain they caused. One day, I was on the brink of death (at least that’s what it felt like to me). I collapsed outside of my mother’s apartment  and blacked out because I haven’t been eating. My old step-mother (dad’s ex wife) kicked me in the stomach and told my mother and I instantly got in trouble and she threatened to put me in a mental hospital. I was always blamed for everything. I think this was because I’m my dad’s daughter. In March of 2016, I eventually packed all of my stuff one Thursday night and when my dad got me the next morning, I left her house for good. It’s almost been four years with no contact from her. So I think I made the best decision. My life so far isn’t perfect still but it’s better than what I had before.  This response probably doesn’t make senses but I can relate to your post."
depression,ffjdkqs,t3_etyhy0,1579996029.0,"When my my dad’s ex-wife told my mother about my suicidal notes in 2013, my mother threatened to have me admitted in a mental hospital. My dad knew about this and did absolutely nothing. I got in trouble because of my depression that was caused by my mother, my dad’s ex-wife ( who was my stepmother at the time), and my father. No one even asked if I was okay."
