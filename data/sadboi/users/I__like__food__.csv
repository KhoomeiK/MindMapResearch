Frugal,fqyw01w,t1_fqyllbv,1589755507.0,"This. According to google and myself (I priced out building materials for a 6000 sq ft house for fun) diy house construction is around $75-$150 per sq foot.

$150 would be marble feature wall, fireplace, lvl framing, spray foam, waterproof barriers, massive windows, etc.

$75 is more like traditional framing with spray foam, marble counter tops, decent backsplash and tiling, nice floors, etc.

Could probably get it down to $50/sq ft with concrete diy countertops, cheaper tile, vinyl floor, etc

And that‚Äôs without the cost of land, which can be extremely pricey in the suburbs, and less so rurally but then you have to worry about utilities, which can cost as much as the house itself for a nice solar system, septic, well, etc."
Frugal,fqyv102,t3_glmgin,1589755027.0,"Hate to break it to you but the cost of materials for a modern house can run anyway from $75-$150 per sq foot (depending on your taste) without labor.

Yeah it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs more than just slapping materials together. Hiring a good contractor is difficult and requires loss of research as well.

There‚Äôs local codes to abide by, inspections to schedule, and you have to keep everything level and plum via things like bracing. Not to mention you have to be aware of how the load throughout the house transfers to the foundation, among many other structural specifications.

I would recommend watching some you tubers building their own homes. Wild wonderful off grid, life uncontained, and home renovision diy are all great channels on YouTube to get you started. 

But I mean, take it from me, drywalling looks easy to do, but it‚Äôs always 10x harder than it looks. You‚Äôre going to make mistakes, have to redo things, and that will cost you time and money.

TLDR; Watch youtubers who do the same thing you want to so you can learn, practice on a smaller scale before taking the project on (try building a shed), have the correct tools, and understand that everything is harder than it looks and will end up taking much longer and costing more than you think."

I don‚Äôt want to insinuate anything, but is it possible she has been and hasn‚Äôt told anyone? It would be completely human if she has, quitting alcohol cold turkey is nearly impossible.

However, in that case I believe reverse tolerance would be an even bigger factor. Since she hasn‚Äôt had anything to drink in 2 months, it means her tolerance to alcohol is virtually nothing. Couple that with the fact that she was used to drinking a lot and she probably went overboard this time. Add reverse tolerance to the equation, basically meaning not only has her tolerance gone ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù, it has actually gone to less than it was before she had even begun drinking. 

To sum it up, her tolerance was *extremely* low and she probably drank a lot more than she could handle, because based on what she was used to, she thought she could handle it. All of those factors led to an extreme intoxication to the point of psychosis.

I would recommend she stay away from alcohol and all drugs completely for a while, at least a year, preferably indefinitely (feel free to ask her doctor about this too.) I know - it fucking sucks. But she has proof that she is prone to psychosis from alcohol and probably other drugs as well. 

If she does decide to start drinking again (after a year hiatus) start SLOW. I‚Äôm talking 1/8-1/4 of a shot. After that, even if she doesn‚Äôt feel anything, wait 5-10 days before drinking again, then try double. Continue on that path but for her sake I‚Äôd recommend staying under 2 shots/drinks to be safe.

With college culture this is virtually impossible, but I would HIGHLY recommend it. Coming from someone who has had multiple episodes from other drugs (namely psychedelics) it‚Äôs not worth it. She might feel good in the moment, but when the booze wears off the flip side is feeling like shit for a solid week, with long term side effects of increased anxiety and depression.

Personally, I‚Äôve realized that moderation for any drug is key. Even drinking bi weekly can have a slew of unwanted side effects, especially for someone prone to said side effects. If anything, I‚Äôd highly recommend weed to take the edge off. But as with anything, moderation and extremely small amounts will be key because smoking too much ganja can still lead to psychological/physical withdrawals, or psychosis if over-consumed. Much less so than alcohol though.

Either way, my best wishes go out to her. Mental hospitals and breakdowns in general are not fun, in fact they are terrifying. I would recommend starting therapy if possible, try to avoid therapist that push meds though, as often times they will only serve to worsen the condition (but that‚Äôs a different story..). But having someone to talk to that can offer unbiased advice can be very helpful.

Best of luck and if you have any other questions feel free to ask. Sorry for rambling too, I really hope she gets better :)"

Psychosis,fqnkmd2,t1_fqna4mj,1589496550.0,"This. She might have been drinking more previously, but her state of mind may have been different this time. 

Also, to get more technical, since she has been drinking a lot she has been going through withdrawals and that‚Äôs what could‚Äôve triggered it. You might think ‚Äúoh but she was drinking alcohol so how is she withdrawing‚Äù. Well when you drink alcohol, 8 hours after drinking the effects of the alcohol begin to fade and the body attempts to maintain homeostasis. These are what withdrawals are, since the Neurochemicals are out of balance and will be trying to recover for 7+ days, she could have been in a significantly altered state of mind due to her past drinking. That could‚Äôve been much more of a factor than what she was drinking that day.

Also reverse tolerance. She could‚Äôve been more sensitive to alcohol due to the withdrawals, leading to her being drunk even when she wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù.

Imo, mental hospitals are scary and the diagnosis might not always be correct, but if she recovers from this and stops drinking then it will have prove to been an isolated incident caused by alcohol. If in, say a month or 2, she is still delusional, then it may not be alcohol induced psychosis.

Also, it may take more than 2 months to recover from heavy drinking in terms of how depressed she feels, how much anxiety she has, and her ability to live her life.

Drugs and disorders are extremely complicated and a lot more goes into a diagnosis than is seen at face value."
