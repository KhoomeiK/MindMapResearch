SuicideWatch,expf21t,t1_expesv0,1566489698.0,Thanks. It helps to talk about it on here.
SuicideWatch,expdlec,t1_expcuo7,1566489147.0,"Yeah, I honestly prefer praying or talking to close friends about it. Because I know that that will help me get through, even if I don't feel any better. I know that they actually care about me and aren't just paid to interact with me.

Honestly, most of my experience seeking medical help has just been professionals throwing things at me to make all my problems go away."

AskReddit,ex5liqb,t3_crc4n7,1566026478.0,"One day as toddler, I rode my tricycle out to the back yard, where my construction working dad kept a sheet of some kind of metal up on those horse things (I'm not a construction worker, as you can see).

For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to ride along side of it.

I don't remember that much about it, just that I had a long, shallow cut on my right arm and I was crying while it dripped blood on the front porch, my mom hurriedly trying to help me."
Catholicism,ewu9q57,t3_cq2xk3,1565771013.0,I love Celtic Woman's rendition of it. It's what got me into appreciating that song (and Latin hymns in general).
depression,ewu9ld9,t3_cpvwhh,1565770823.0,"Sweet Jesus, yes.

I remember a solid school year going by where it felt like that was just injected into my veins every day. It felt like hell.

Worst part is, my dad can't believe it. Every time I've opened up to him about what happened that year, how I constantly felt like killing myself just to get off this boring painful ride, he just can't believe it. After all, I had perfect grades and did all my chores & well, you get the point. It's really the perfect lie, and it sucks."
