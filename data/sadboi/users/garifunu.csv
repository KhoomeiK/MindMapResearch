I can cook, clean, play videos, and all while watching anime. You know why? Because I don't have to look at the subs. 


Also, when there's a show I really like, I'll watch it twice, sub and rub a dub dub. It lets me see if there's anything lost in translation (which happens *a lot*). I try not to judge on quality of voice actors because of budget, age, etc. There are bad dubs but nothing that won't make me cringe. 

Discrimination against subs or dubs isn't an issue of weebism. It's about enlightenment. Or maybe it's just me. Idk, but I hope some Pepega will resonate with me."
