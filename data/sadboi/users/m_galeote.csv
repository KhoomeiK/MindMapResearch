BipolarReddit,euimsin,t3_cglnwe,1563851063.0,"OP, I wouldn't tell the co-worker. The story about having bipolar is something that a person should earn the rights to hear about it. It's so hard to be diagnosed, and to start taking meds, realizing everything that happened to you and why.
This is a story that I only share with people that I trust the most, and that I know that will hear me with empathy."
BipolarReddit,euim92k,t3_cgmkna,1563850781.0,"I had trouble trusting my brain with decisions when I got diagnosed. It feels wrong to trust my brain since he's pretty fucked up, right? Nope.
I realized that despite having made terrible choices in the past, I also made really good ones. I have to trust that I'm doing what I can to make better choices, and if I do something not so good, I can learn from it.

I'm not sure if that's what you meant with having issue making decisions, but I hope this can help you. Lots of love, OP!"
bipolar,euiliag,t3_cgjiw6,1563850355.0,"Just to add a little clarification about the elements: I felt like drawing what was inside my head last week. Things got pretty overwhelming and my whole world seemed to be bursting into flames and nothing that I could do about it.

So, there's me, in the middle of the fire. Me, on the right side, trying to save myself, but I don't know what that means (I'm afraid I might go into a hypo episode). Me, again, on top of everything, trying to be analytical and look with perspective.

I highly recommend drawing if you ever feel overwhelmed because it really takes everything from your head and it makes your mind a lot clearer after you finish."
