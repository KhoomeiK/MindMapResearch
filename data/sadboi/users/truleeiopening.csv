depression,fgf2y1o,t3_ey4dle,1580721525.0,I swear I have the same feeling most days. I'm so overwhelmed by life right now. I really just want to pause time so I could finally get some rest and gather my thoughts and emotions.
depression,fgf20ks,t3_cpidz8,1580720106.0,I understand the feeling completely. I'm noticing that I'm never satisfied in the moment. It's usually something else I rather be doing. I have strong feelings of disinterest in many activities I used to love.
