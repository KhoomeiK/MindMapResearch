I had a similar family dynamic. Couldn't talk to my parents about my feeling or was very anxious when I had to. Stepmom was emotionally and mentally abusive. I was taught to do basic chores and cook.

I had to teach myself how to set up insurance, find a doctor and make an appointment.

I had to figure out college and jobs on my own.

You are 18. You're life isn't over, it's just beginning. You can learn everything your parents didn't teach you. But the first thing you need to do is work on moving out on your own.

You are right in those matters (though it may be friendly to invite your daughters friend in to eat lunch rather than telling them to go home) kids generally need boundaries and to respect both parents. If mom is undermining what you tell your daughter, your daughter will not respect you and what you ask of her. Also try explaining to you daughter why you want her to stop doing something - stop jumping on the couch because she may fall, get hurt, break the couch, etc. Get a trampoline if you have room for one.

Hope this helps."
