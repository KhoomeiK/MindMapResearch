Oftentimes when lifters get stuck in the hole or at depth of a squat it's because they move to slow with no confidence downward, so when they make it to the bottom they've used up their energy and have to let go of the breath they were using to brace. Emphasis on go as quickly as your form will allow you to, in other words go as quickly as you can without compromising form and without dive-bombing your squat."

formcheck,f031eu2,t1_f030zyf,1568342497.0,"Actually, I hate to be the outlier here, but I would disagree with slow and controlled on the way down. An efficient squat should be fast and controlled, at least as fast as your form will allow you to descend. Reason being is because moving slower will only use up most of your energy, that you could use to move out of the hole. So when moving up to your 1rm, you can efficiently come out of the hole, without using up your energy resources during the decent. However it's great to practice slow movement through tempo squats.

Other than this your squat looks great! Is there any way, you can get your elbows closer below the bar? Perhaps try getting wider and rotating your scapula inward."

As in you are focused on the job rather than training, that can certainly affect your energy levels :)."
xxfitness,ezxnnpi,t3_d2poym,1568244977.0,"Perhaps volume might be to much, try eating meals that are high in carbohydrates before the gym, to give a little energy boost. Also I did notice you already mentioned your protein intake falls short, so just continuing off of that, protein intake does make a huge difference in your performance when in a calorie deficit. Remember  1.6-1.8 grams per kg of body weight.  

Also check some other factors that you may not realize might be affecting your performance, are you living a high stress life, do you get enough sleep, do you not rest enough in between sets at the gym? 

And as someone said before it's definitely possible you might be eating a little to low for your activity level, you could try slowly bringing up Cal's week by week, and monitoring your weight. You should stop bringing them up when you notice no more weight loss. Try to concentrate most of the extra Cal's as carbs and protein, as these will provide extra energy, and are less likely to be stored as fat, ( though its not much of big difference compared to the macro fat ). I only suggest this, because you sound like you are a very active person. 

If all else fails, try taking a deload week, or a diet break!!
Good luck, I hope you can overcome this little blip, keep getting strong, btw I love the program you're doing!!! Is your program the megsquats program? If so, that's really badass!"

Or perhaps you are overworking yourself and trying to progress to fast, are you giving yourself proper rests? Do you have any rest days? Check your nutrition, make sure you are at least getting enough protein, approximately 1.6-1.8 grams per kg of bodyweight per day. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, and make sure you are not trying to do to much volume all in one day. 

If all else fails take a deload week, lower intensity and volume of all exercises for one week, then come back to your regular intensity."

Possibly the volume of your workouts isn't enough, or it's just right. Sometimes when you take on more training days, and have to lower the volume of each day, it feels like it's not enough. I would suggest, paying attention to your numbers, and making sure you are progressing higher and higher. Whether that be volume, intensity, or weight. If they're not progressing then its not enough, if they are, then you're good to go! Write those numbers down!
Also soreness isn't a good indicator of a good workout. It can be quite possibly the opposite, like week long Dom's on your glutes and legs probably means you went to hard on them."

I absolutely hate it, however after a while of dealing with this I've learned to avoid carbonated drinks , as well as other tummy offenders (check out the FODMAP diet), before a potentially anxiety inducing situation. This helps me personally, because I already have a sensitive stomach, (probably from the anxiety), so I know that eating the tummy offenders will just make the anxiety induced stomach problems worse. At least they're not that bad if I have eaten mild things before. I eat my tummy offenders when I know I'll be relaxed.

For me it's literally Everytime I got to the gym, and I mean EVERY SINGLE TIME. Plus I go to the gym almost everyday... And when I'm about to meet up with my estranged friends, or do something job like.
