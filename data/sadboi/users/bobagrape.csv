It feels like you're born broken, because you can't feel the way so many other people can, and it seems like that was and always will be the case. I hate it so, so much. As much as it really doesn't seem that way, literally everything, our interests, love, our feelings, our happiness, is temporary. You can't convince yourself to just be ok with this and that, just like I or a therapist can't convince you, or I can't convince myself. Things just sort of happen, it's not something we can force. Just like how I hated sushi all my life and now I can't get enough of it lol

Medication has helped a little, I'm getting some energy back. My therapist isn't helpful. I'm working on all those problems because I'm sick of feeling so terrible, so being happy has become my purpose and what I work towards, which I think is what most people are doing. Depression is a never ending battle but it gets easier to deal with just as it can get harder.
After awhile I learned to stop caring so much about people, as in I stopped depending on others to feel good. I stopped getting hurt after that because I got used to it. I got used to the idea that that's just how it is and it has nothing to do with anyone. Like you said, there are only so many times, and you can feel terrible for a very long time, but this comes in the process of accepting it and moving on.

I said that well loved people also want to die because I'm trying to explain to you that even if you had great friends that never hurt you, you would still want to die. Your problems, the mental illness that you have, would not be fixed if you had better friends. You need to accept the things you cannot avoid, and I'm sure if it keeps happening you'll get the hang of it."
