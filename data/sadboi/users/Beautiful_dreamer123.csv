Anxiety,fioez9b,t3_f8xr4s,1582581948.0,"I don’t know exactly why I’m going.   I guess, just to document it so they know why I’m working from home occasionally.  I guess I didn’t think about doctor documentation.  I just thought it was be a good idea to get some advice from HR on what they advise about working with a disability. Working full time/having a career is very new to me and I’m just trying to get by"
Anxiety,fio7ag2,t3_f8wv3g,1582577679.0,How I’m supposed to be a functioning adult with a job for the rest of my life when working is severely contributing to my mental health problems.  I booked an appointment with a psychiatrist so I’m excited but nervous for that.
Anxiety,fio6sty,t3_f8xd4t,1582577408.0,"Just remember, she is your mom and she wants what is best for you.  I’m sure she would not judge you for what you have to tell her and I’m sure she wants to help you in anyway she can.

If it makes you feel any better, at 22 years old I finally told my parents the real extent of my mental health issues.  I’ve been terrified to tell them for years and I finally did today and it was scary, but it felt really good and they were supportive and understanding.

I wish you all the luck and I’m rooting for you!"
Anxiety,fgqubyj,t3_f011oa,1581031662.0,Yes my heart rate is very rarely under 90 and usually around 105-115. Brought it up to my doctor and he just dismissed me so that was nice...
Anxiety,fgqu3xt,t3_ezw6we,1581031528.0,Yep that was today. Anxiety was so high for seemingly no reason
Anxiety,fftowhk,t3_ev6xbe,1580226277.0,I tried to put this in an edit but idk if it worked. I could really use someone to talk to.  If anyone is willing to hear me rant from time to time and wouldn’t be triggered by anxiety/depression thoughts please I am desperate and I feel alone.
Anxiety,ff60jq1,t1_ff602ru,1579616008.0,I know how you feel and I know it can be tricky when you need a lot of time off.  I found it best to just be up front and honest with your boss or HR.
Anxiety,fed7llt,t3_eo8ep9,1579002598.0,Congrats!! That’s awesome! Look into if the school you choose offers free therapy/counseling and take advantage of that! I only did that my last year of college and wish I would’ve started sooner
Anxiety,fcw1spn,t3_ej29di,1578015168.0,I had a mental breakdown about this just this morning before work
insomnia,fbxw03g,t3_eeywpk,1577201960.0,Maybe this is silly but maybe listen to a professor lecture (a really boring topic) on YouTube when you’re trying to sleep
Anxiety,f9kpm4x,t3_e5n4pc,1575405318.0,"I’m sorry your experiencing public speaking anxiety, I can definitely relate!  I would definitely talk to your doctor about everything and then you two can make a decision to see if medication is right for you.

Good luck with everything :)"
Anxiety,f9ko9f0,t3_e5mvzk,1575404537.0,"Congratulations! That’s awesome and I’m so happy for you, you did it!!"
Anxiety,f9kngtb,t3_e5m5ns,1575404073.0,"Maybe ask your school’s counseling center if they have any therapy recommendations outside of school .  I’m sure they would be able to help you get the help you need now.  Hang in there, I hope things start to look better for you :)"
Anxiety,f9kn4xn,t3_e5mihl,1575403882.0,"Congrats for making the step to getting yourself into therapy, that’s awesome!! I wish you all the luck! Hang in there friend :)"
Anxiety,f9kmoak,t3_e5kyd6,1575403611.0,"I go through the same exact thing almost every morning.  I found comfort in letting my boss know I have a medical condition which sometimes causes me not to be on my A-game.   For whatever reason, telling someone I have a medical condition validated what I’m feeling and makes me feel less alone.  If you decide to let your boss know this, you don’t have to go into specifics.  

You’re not alone in this, I hope you begin to feel better soon!  Just keep reminding yourself those feelings will eventually pass."
Anxiety,f9klvsg,t3_e5lhw0,1575403136.0,"I would start by asking the person who is experiencing an anxiety attack if there is anything you can do to help them.  If they say no, just tell them know you’ll be there for them.

In the future, I would refrain from touching someone unless you asked if it’s ok.  I know you had the right intentions, so don’t beat yourself up. Just take it as a learning opportunity :)

Thanks for asking this question, it makes me happy people like you genuinely want to help others with anxiety!"
Anxiety,f9jsm0v,t3_e5hyhk,1575384729.0,"I just wanted to let you know I am going through such a similar thing right now.  I just graduated college as well, got a good job, but my anxiety feels like it’s taking over.  Sorry I don’t have advice, but you’re not alone."

Anxiety,etabsjf,t1_et9t480,1562616703.0,"In a way, it’s comforting to me calling it a disorder.  My whole life I was just told it was all in my head and that I can control it.  I try to not let anxiety be an “excuse”, but sometimes it really does prevent me from doing things and knowing it’s a disorder makes me feel better because it’s not my fault, it’s just something I live with :)"

Anxiety,et9j9v3,t3_calvh3,1562598259.0,"I throw up a lot of mornings before work too from anxiety.  Honestly, there is not much you can do but be there for him.  Ask him what you can do to make him feel better.  Maybe encourage him to get some help.  I’m sorry he has to deal with that.  But you’re a good person for asking how you can help, I’m sure he appreciates you :)"
