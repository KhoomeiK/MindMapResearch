BreakUp,fnb9r87,t3_fnf9p9,1586811700.0,Literally happened tonight. Doesn't feel real.
mentalhealth,fm83ga4,t3_ftna20,1585842087.0,How are you doing? What are your indoor hobbies that are keeping you going?
piercing,fir6ry5,t1_fir66yg,1582658494.0,I'll do that as both sides got pierced at the same time and I dont want it happening on the right.
piercing,fiqrien,t1_fiqqytc,1582650422.0,"Not sure on the material, will ask in future. I don't think I play with it, but who knows. After some research it might be because I've been sleeping on it. I had asked the piercer about sleeping on it and they said it would be fine."
depression,ffdmhm5,t3_eswbpt,1579824029.0,Had this at work today. You are strong. You can do this.
depression,ffdm0jt,t3_enrs4c,1579823732.0,"You exactly sound like me. I'm definately depressed and the last two days I have been in a really dark place. But everytime I think about tell someone how dark it is in here, I think I'm attention seeking or I dont want to burden them with it."
childfree,ff2oasr,t3_er31jv,1579516103.0,Thank you. I meet people with children and the second I don't want any they shut down and its the end of any potential friendship. I said I didnt want any not that I hated them.
childfree,fdrrcge,t1_fdrpxyp,1578688542.0,"He tries be involved. When she was living with mum, she wouldnt let him near the baby. She uses people to fit and end. They are only currently together because it fits her needs. My partner has Aspergers but it doesn't effect him very much. When she first met this poor guy, she told me he had Aspegers as if it was something to be proud of, ""look at me with the guy with a disability."" She likes him because he will ask how high when she asks him to jump. He has his issues and I don't particularly like him, but i think i saw what she turned him into not who he actually is. 

I know karma will come for her eventually. I don't want children but I love my neice very much and don't want to see her suffer because her mother is an awful person. I am having to be polite to keep an eye on the baby. 

Its just hard because my sister doesn't realise how in the wrong she is. She used to talk how she would never live on benefits but here she is proudly showing off her council house and unearned money, when i know so many people who want children but can't have any. Would love to work but can't because they are disabled. And cannot get the council house they so desperately need because people like my sister exist. 

Sorry for the rant but it feels super good to get it off my chest."
sex,fca15vy,t3_egpm14,1577561350.0,Just not in the mood. And simply asking isnt going to create the mood.
confessions,fasqy5z,t3_eaj5oq,1576330317.0,That is the sweetest thing.
Rabbits,fasq7kx,t3_eaib8t,1576330041.0,"I legitimately thought this was a pop picture of my Rabbit. Could be twins. 

Super adorable BTW."
Anxiety,fa4525u,t3_e7quo5,1575801052.0,This comment isn't going to help other than the shared knowledge that I experience this feeling too. I'm always petrified i'll be fired.
funny,f8d0uw3,t3_e04xk9,1574474959.0,This has to be fake. Otherwise it is the worlds pettiest school.
relationship_advice,f7e01lh,t3_dvhfwq,1573639346.0,"I have seen this happen, don't go there. She is stringing you along. Your her back up if the other guy shes seeing doesnt work out. Your better off cutting ties. 

But tell her dont just ghost."
Rabbits,f2pywhk,t3_ddx9xj,1570352830.0,"The bunny flop. If they feel happy, safe and content they will flop on their sides. It a show of trust because their bellies are exposed."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,f2py5gx,t3_ddlfah,1570352462.0,Also in the animal kingdom bright colours are used to attract mates sooooo.......
Rabbits,f2pxldz,t3_ddy8wt,1570352198.0,Good Luck. When we bought our Bun Friend. We also got the bunny he was already bunked with as we thought they got along. A week in and they were really badly hurting each other. We had to give one up because we couldn't do two seperate enclosures. From my research its because they were both boys. So hopefully it works out for you.
UnsentLetters,f2pwfzz,t3_ddt61n,1570351647.0,"Yes. Because it made me a stronger person and lead me to my one and only. 

(Who by some demented twist of fate - didnt know until 2 months in - used to be in a relationship with my exes sister.)"
childfree,f2pvvcf,t3_dds1d6,1570351386.0,"I remember saying to someone, that i don't want kids because i want to be able to go on holiday or splurge on something. I don't want to be worried about how much Rosie and Jims school uniforms are going to cost. 

I want to be able to buy the fast pass at an amusement park."
relationship_advice,f2puy8i,t3_ddyler,1570350898.0,"Thats weird. I don't know anyone that was like ""wanna have a wank party?"". Is it like a competition to see who can Jizz the most? 

He should respect your wishes and stop. I can't tell you how to proceed other than ask him again and maybe leave. How do you know thats all hes doing with his friends."

relationship_advice,evbu928,t1_evb6r0r,1564394775.0,"Lets not forget they were having conversations about how it’s a shame they didn’t work out. That is not platonic. I don’t text my friends saying it’s a shame we didn’t fuck, and then send them a sex toy."
IAmA,erju063,t3_c24fio,1560946839.0,"I have months where I get migraines almost every day, varying degrees of pain. And then other months where I have very few. Would that still be considered chronic migraines and should I be pursing my doctor for a diagnosis?"
gameofthrones,eo96xhq,t3_bqiyov,1558383811.0,"I came late to the Game of Thrones party. I binge watched it 2 weeks before the last series started being released. There are alot of unanswered questions in this season and alot of holes, but you know what, it was still a hell of a ride."
