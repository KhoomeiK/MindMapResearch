Relapsing with self-harm is always difficult but I imagine it’s being exacerbated by everything else going on. Try not to let this slip-up turn snowball into something else, especially if it’s been 15 years with your partner. I know we are strangers on the internet, but something in me really felt the need to remind you how valuable, strong, and worth being loved you are. If you find yourself slipping into dark thoughts, please please reach out to someone, even though it’s especially difficult with this quarantine situation. Sending you love— this pain will fade. Promise."

BorderlinePDisorder,fjyoa19,t3_ffim5f,1583701040.0,"If you have the urge to self-harm, try clenching ice in your palm. If you have the urge to isolate, allow yourself some alone time to level out, usually after heartbreaks I’ll binge a shitty reality TV show or some rom coms just to take my mind off of it. Don’t “check up” on your ex or attempt to mend things just yet, give yourself some time to heal and you might not feel the desire to go back to said person. Make a list of all the things you want in a potential lover just to remind yourself that you’re worthy of something great. Warm baths. Tea. Video games (personal preference but really helps me). Clean out your closet Marie Kondo style, treat yourself to a *reasonably priced* gift or meal, clean your room/house. 

In my experience, the first week is almost unbearable. Whether it was a week long fling or three year relationship, my abandonment issues cause me to implode and isolate. It always always always gets better, try to remember that your feelings are valid but they’re also amplified. I have a habit of falling back into relationships to avoid being alone and recognizing that has helped me overcome it time and time again. It might not feel better to be alone for the first few weeks, but eventually you’ll be thankful you didn’t stay with someone who isn’t right for you, just give it time and best of luck to you! Stay well."

I understand you don’t like the word choice but that doesn’t make what you’re saying a fact.  Sexual preference/orientation doesn’t include sexually deviant behavior. Examples of sexual preference include straight/bi/gay/asexual/whatever else— which is why there are straight/bi/etc... pedophiles.

Agree to disagree about the word choice though. I still don’t understand the point of jumping to the defense of pedophilic priests. Blink twice if you need help."

ShouldIbuythisgame,faweqpo,t3_earieh,1576370052.0,"As much as I love Skyrim, I’d say RDR2 or The Last of Us. Story mode is incredible in both but RDR2 is open world and a bit slow-paced, which really adds to the realism imo. The stakes are high in both but you have more interactions with NPCs available in RDR2, while TLOU is mostly focused on Joel and Ellie, which is one of the most heart-touching relationships in a video game to date. Both will make you cry, probably a couple times. 

The Last of Us is between 12-16 hours gameplay for story mode. Red Dead Redemption 2 is 40-60 hours story mode + the online hours. So one of the biggest things to consider is online play. The Last of Us has none, sadly. RDR2 online is great and, griefers aside, the community is pretty chill. You’ll be able to put more hours into Red Dead, and although the online mode can’t compare to Arthur’s story, you can still fill your craving for the Wild West once you finish the game."

Keep in mind that people are out here torturing, raping, and killing people.
