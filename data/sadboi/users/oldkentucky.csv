I hope I’m right about this so justice can be served. Dear god.OK, so I checked out the Annie Wright school page and it’s a boarding school with dormitories for children. One thing that stood out to me is the color of the paint on the wall. I have seen that color in libraries, medical facilities (I’m a dialysis patient) and the color is used due to its ‘calming effect’. Then I took a virtual tour of the Annie Wright School and in the corner of one photo— taken in the school library— there it was— the same color.

I was renting the upstairs unit of a house (in an undisclosed location) when I decided to crawl into the attic of the old home and see if I could find anything interesting. Sure enough, I found a large sealed Rubbermaid container that was full of love letters, clothing, a Nintendo controller and a black balaclava. 
Next to the Rubbermaid, I found a long cardboard box, which turned out to have a baseball bat within. The bat had been customized, which is a service that is offered by the Louisville Slugger Museum for a fee. I scoured Facebook and Google yielded some interesting results. The individual whose name was on the bat, was the same guy who threw a textbook at Papa John Schnatter...! I froze when I made the connection. If some folks recall, Schnatter was training on his bicycle with some Olympian. I will not name the culprit whose name is emblazoned on the baseball bat, but he ‘got the book thrown at him’, so to speak. 
I wonder if this bat is worth anything?"
