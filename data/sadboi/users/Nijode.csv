 I suppose you want the government to continue printing money out of thin air to keep the relief money going. I hope that is not what you are suggesting because that will cause hyperinflation and lead to a massive depression in the US(It would likely hurt the entire world economy).

Do you know how much tax revenue is being missed because people are not being paid and spending that money? City and State governments might have a really hard time paying for all of the services they currently provide if their tax revenue continues to be decimated.

What about the number of people who are going to die by suicide that could have been saved if things started going back to normal? I can personally say that my number one mechanism to pull myself back from the edge of suicide has been closed by the government. The positive progress that I have made to get better is disappearing.

Even the WHO was saying that coronavirus wasn't something to be terribly worried about!

All of the downplaying of the virus was based on information coming out of China that in hindsight was pretty obviously not accurate.

Social distancing and the stay at home orders were meant to ""flatten the curve"" so our hospitals could treat everyone instead of deciding who would and would not get treatment like happened in Italy.
