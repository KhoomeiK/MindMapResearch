learnswahili,fp6m57y,t3_gb79cn,1588354708.0,"I don't think learning a language could ever be ""cultural appropriation.""  Learning a language shows an interest in the people who speak it, and most would consider it flattery to spend your limited time learning their language, of all ways you could spend your time.    As another user pointed out, East Africa is where our species evolved from, so in some sense everyone on the planet has a connection to the area, even if distant.  

In college I had studied French and Arabic already, and signed up for Swahili on a whim.  I have no cultural connection to the region (American of mixed European heritage). It turned out to be far more enjoyable than I imagined.  The language is just so fun to speak and its a widely spoken language that's growing.   Its been many years since I first studied it, and now that I've started again I regret ever stopping.

He has a pretty good American accent, that he worked hard for, but its not perfect.  And it also doesn't matter.  As long as you can communicate effectively, most people won't care.  

If you're looking for a flawless accent, then I'm not sure its possible unless you were here as a baby.  I know people who have been here since they were in kindergarten or preschool and they still have a slight accent.  Even with very good, practiced accents, something almost inevitably will seem off to a native.  But I have met that rare individual who it took numerous conversations with to start to suspect they had a different mother tongue.  Maybe its talent, maybe hard work, probably both.  

I know it can be done, but its very rare.  I also don't think its necessary.  

Here's one of his articles.  I'm pretty sure he has more.  And videos on Youtube.  Might be worth it to you.

This NTNU post is being a bit hyperbolic, as they know very well the majority of Americans do in fact have excellent coverage, but they're applying the situation of the uninsured and extending it to us all.  Americans are used to European's constantly ragging on us.  I don't pay it much mind, as I know better, and I'm sure NTNU does as well.

Basically, if Americans have enough money to be able to travel to or live in Norway, they have enough for good health care.

Don't take this the wrong way, I absolutely believe our health care system needs improvement, and agree with all criticisms of access in the US for lower class citizens, but for the majority of the population, its excellent.

I've never needed to use Norway's hospitals or doctor's offices while I've been there, so I can't comment on that.  I just naturally assume its excellent as well, like everything seems to be there.
