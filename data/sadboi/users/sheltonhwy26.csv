Vendrick doesn’t attack because he has gone hollow, lost all of his humanity.  That’s why we find him naked and shambling, because when he shed his clothes, crown, and ring, he effectively shed his human side.

While Gwyn and Vendrick play a very similar role in the story (we seek both of them out), one is a god who is fighting for all he knows, and the other knows nothing of the kingdom he left behind.  Vendrick left because he realized that the undead curse was a chain put on man and it would stay with them, it was a part of them.

I think a big part of the story made much more sense after realizing this, because it seems like an amazing thing to be Immortal, but in the reality of things not being able to die holds consequences for those around you.  

Wolf hates the immortality because it hurts those he has learned to care for, and it hurts him more to see Kuro’s reaction to the pain immortality and dragon rot can cause.  We see the same sort of selfish thinking earlier in the game, with Genichiro  and his sacrifice of humanity for immortality.
