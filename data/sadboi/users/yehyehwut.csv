Instead of ignoring or trying to push the thoughts away you just accept them and they lose power and influence.

If you just literally say to yourself ""Hey brain thanks for telling me I'm a worthless piece of shit"" then it stops.  Sounds weird but it works.  In a way I guess it also helps you challenge the thought like in CBT because you can see how silly it is and whether it's true or not.
