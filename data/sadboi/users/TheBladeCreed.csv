None of the things he is saying or doing are ok in any way. He sounds like a very controlling ex I had. My life instantly got better when she was not in it. I’m not saying you should dump him, because that’s a bit extreme. Definitely try to sit him down and have a serious conversation. If none of this works, drive him to counseling without his knowledge.
