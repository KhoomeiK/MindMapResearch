kpopthoughts,fqyq6km,t3_gldiyx,1589752725.0,"I actually prefer starting to stan later in the group's career...

I mean, by then they have a larger discography, and there's less of a chance for the next comeback to be something totally not my style if I liked everything up until now.

Also, the chemistry between members will be more developed, and I love that, because I personally love groups that feel like old friends, if you get me.

But the biggest personal reason for this opinion is because the stanning can be... less anxious? I guess. I mean, when you stan a rookie there's always this undercurrent of ""will they get recognised"" and when they do ""how long will it last"" or ""what if there's a scandal?"". When I get into older groups that are still active, I feel like they've weathered all that and gotten more assured of their place in the market (even if they aren't the most popular). I mean, the bitter truth is that if they're not famous enough, in 99% of the cases they won't last for 5-6 years of regular activity.

So yeah... that's my reasoning which turned out a lot longer than I expected!"

Somewhere around episode three realised I really liked this leader dude from this Nu'est group I had kinda heard of.

By episode six Ong was no longer my first pick, he was.

Got shell shocked when he didn't get into WannaOne.

Watched his first solo VLive post Broduce live even tho it had no subs, didn't even matter.

And thus began my ulting of Kim JR."
unpopularkpopopinions,fq98aid,t3_gh9mzj,1589189215.0,"There is this one Day6 song (comes from their 2017 project when they released a song a month, IIRC) that had verses that slapped so hard!!! but when it got to the chorus it lost all of the intensity of the verses' and sounded super generic.

I had to turn it off because it made me physically angry to see so much potential wasted. 

For the life of me I can't remember which one it was, though."

Ren Harry Potter/Hottest office worker 11/10

Suddenly vocalist JR with tattoos and that smirk 11/10

Pink haired soft Baekho 11/10

Blonde Minhyun and Aron 22/10

The actual song isn't half bad either. That driving bass is really sexy, and the verses sound super smooth and funky (especially the Aron ""waterfall"" part).

The only thing I'm not completely sold on is the first part of the chorus - it feels like it should have upped the intensity a little bit, when it stayed more or less the same?

But that's just for a moment, because when it gets to ""I'm in trouble""×100, it gets real sexy and cool again."

I live in a small country in Europe called Serbia (if you're from the US there's a good chance you haven't heard of it).

 And usually I don't mind being, so to say, insignificant, but now it is grinding my gears because if I want to know the situation in my country I have to check the news, because the only people who are reporting the situation here are our media. And the news, as we all know, can be a bit triggering, so for example today we have the Prime Minister saying ""if we have three more days similar to yesterday, the health system will collapse"" (and we do seem to have a comparatively large CFR, but that's probably because you have to be damn near dead to get tested).

And I know they're probably being dramatic to make people really stay indoors, and I know I'm doing my part and I shouldn't feel guilty, but sometimes I wish I could just have the luxury of having unbiased English language sources writing about Serbia..."

I live in a country that survived one of the worst hyperinflations ever, in the early 90s. You had to line up just for a carton of milk and a loaf of bread, if you received a paycheck in the morning, it was completely worthless by the afternoon. My parents lived through it, made do for a while, had me a few years later, and by all counts live perfectly happy lives.

I'm not saying this to scare you, because I don't believe at all it's going to be like that, but to illustrate that even in a situation like that, you just... do what you can and it usually turns out OK. My parents even feel kinda nostalgic about some aspects of their lives back then."

However, I *do* think that, and this doesn't necessarily have to do with you in particular, that we, as a human race, could adjust to living like this for a year.
