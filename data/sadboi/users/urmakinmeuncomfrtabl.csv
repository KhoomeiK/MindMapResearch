But if it is true, you are basically telling them that those prisoners are still the only people who believe in him and therefore people aren't worth confiding in. 

Now consider the potential harm of NOT calling out a possibly fake post. There is none. No one could be negatively affected by being internet famous for a fake post, except maybe some self-hate/guilt for karma whoring in the first place if they care about something like that.

You may think you are protecting Reddit's validity or some shit, but really you MIGHT be hurting people who are in a bad place and need support.

He had a lot of good things going for him, except he is an angry and violent drunk. He had a loving family and his own successful business, but he wouldn't accept help for his addiction. Every night, he would get smashed and start fights with anyone and everyone. He would come home from the bars concussed or with a broken jaw. I saw him throw his twin brother across the room and these were both 6ft+ dudes.ml! He destroyed most of our family photos. He even tried to strangle my mom, whom I truly believe he loved dearly. 

He was told nearly a decade ago that if his drinking habits persisted, he would be dead in ten years. He would vomit blood every morning. He would beg for forgiveness from his heartbroken family every day for his destruction from the night prior. Was any of that enough to seek help and change? Nope.

Just a few months ago, I got a call from my step sister. She told me her dad said he was given six months to live. He is on death row alone in a hospital states away. I find out a week later that he just made it up in the hopes my sister would visit him. He had been couch surfing for years and has now run out of friends to abuse. Last I heard he is living in and out of the homeless shelter.

This man is in his late 50's now, if he hasn't yet crossed the 60 years old mark. His daughter, whom he lied about dying to, is a mother trying to raise a beautiful boy who has never (and probably will never) meet his grandfather. We have all sacrificed so much to try to help this lost, broken man, but you cannot force someone to change.

I sincerely hope I never cross paths with him again, but I also wish he would seek real help. I don't want him to waste his life away to alcoholism, but it's a disease and I cannot control such things. Nor can I tolerate the way he has treated my family (or myself).

My rich friends would clean out our fridge everytime :( my poor mom would be so nice about it because she loves kids, but she also once spent time in a jail cell (one hour, really tiny sentance) for writing bad checks at our local food 4 less.

AskReddit,fdn3bb9,t1_fdm1zlc,1578576041.0,"So, my parents were extremely liberal and into letting kids do whatever they want. For some unexplained reason, I was really conservative and pretty stuck up about personal rules despite my incredible freedom... For our 16th birthday, my step dad got my sis and I a gag gift of a big ol box of condoms. My dumb ass said, ""I don't need these because I'm going to wait until I'm married to have sex."" I was never religious or anything, just really stuck up and weird. My mom laughed at me, becuase she knew I was being a weirdo so she took a condom and drew a heart on it. She told me to give it back to her when I turn 20 if I am still a virgin. (She later told me to not use that condom after a year because it may be compromised.)

I later dropped my dumb personal rule, but still didn't lose my virginity until I was 21 lol. So, as promised, I gave back the condom on my 20th birthday.

Mini side note, my mom's only response to my self declared abstinence was, ""You would test drive a car before you buy it!"" Which still is pretty brilliant, if you ask me."
AskReddit,fdn2m9r,t1_fdmd8jz,1578575432.0,"Are you from LA?

My mom always left the porch light on and one day I learned it was because she lived in the area the Night Stalker (Richard Ramirez) was terrorizing and it was broadcast on the news that he only targeted dark homes. No one with a porch light on was ever bothered by the Night Stalker. The last of his victims survived his attack and was able to identify him, iirc, and that victim lived only a few houses down the street from my mom O.O too close for comfort!

I definitely didn't need anymore reasons to leave the light on after hearing about that!"

I'm pretty excited because people I know are raving about the story, but the first real boss fight did prove to be quite the challenge for me. It was rewarding once I made it through, but surprisingly intense! I'm pretty impatient, though, so if you just block a lot you'll probably be fine :) (I always try to rush in an attack as much as possible lol) 

You might already know this from Battlefront 2, but my father in law (whom also bought the game because of his love for Battlefront 2, but that is literally the only game he's played ever) was just saying he didn't know that ""L3"" means to press down on the left stick, which gave him some trouble for a while. This is something I remember being confused about, too, the first time I saw that kind of prompt (in a different game but it's still the same idea)."

My personal method of distraction has been videogames. Some easy going handheld game like Animal Crossing (New Leaf) on the Nintendo 3DS is nice and low key. Doesn't require much intense focus, but enough stimulation to keep my mind from thinking terrible self hating thoughts (I normally love to read but the pain makes my mind wander too much/it's distracting). And it's honestly a very approachable game if you've never played any. Not to mention it's super cute! 

I realize videogames have a bit of a high price of entry if you don't already have a 3DS or anything to play on, but maybe you can get a used one from a nearby game store or maybe you know a friend who'll lend you theirs to see if you like it at all?"

Everyone is affected differently, so don't take my word as your sign to change meds but wow that made me a hollow shell of a woman. Nothing affected me positively or negatively. It was really scary.

Please be careful if you choose to switch. That medication is one you absolutely have to taper off. If you just stop cold turkey you will be far worse off than any negative side effects you are getting now.

I'm sorry you haven't found the one that works for you yet :( I'm in a similar boat. Hang in there! There are lots of options and your body is unique, you just have to find the right fit for you."

I'm not saying it 'must' be true, I am saying that there isn't enough evidence to state with confidence that it's fake. Or at least, I didn't think there was enough reason, but other more helpful people have shown me reasons I hadn't considered. 

I didn't upvote this post. I didn't comment giving her any praise. If it isn't a fake story, you are kicking someone while they are down which could be very harmful. If it is a fake story, then their story isn't causing any harm to anyone and they get some attention they crave. I don't see the harm in their post so much as I see the harm in the fake callers."
