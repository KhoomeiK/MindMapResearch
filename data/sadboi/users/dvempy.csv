I need to buy a wireless keyboard today up to 150 USD/GBP. 

I want something compact and pre-configured to mac (with mac keys). 

I was about to order the Keychon K2 but delivery to the UK takes up to four weeks. Are there any good wireless alternatives? 

Thanks in advance for any advice/recommendations."

*Without me, my kettle is useless. Without my kettle, I am useless. I must boil my kettle true. I must stir straighter than my enemy.* 

*My kettle and I know that what counts, in tea, is not the bags we brew, the water we boil, nor the milk we add. We know that it is the kettle that counts.*

*My kettle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its spouts, and its handle. I will keep my kettle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other.*

Common sense goes a long way so just apply the same principles as you do at home (like not walking the streets alone at night) and you will be okay. Argentina is really cheap atm due to their economy tanking. Chile, Peru are all very safe. Brazil can be dangerous in my experience. I spent 3 months in Colombia this year and it was incredibly safe and a fantastic experience, particularly in Medellin. They are protecting the tourists at all costs because they are earning so much money from them. There are armed police literally on every street corner 24/7. I never felt safer. Highly recommend."
