See it as your journey, and women should only be passengers. Is she fun enough to join you? If I start talking to a girl, I try to figure out if she is good enough for me. She should not be what I need to be happy, but something to make me even happier!

Also, if you ask a girl out: every rejection and failure is just a step towards becoming better. About the uncomfortableness: if you ask her out and she says no, as long as both of you are polite and you shrug it off like ""that's super cool, have a nice day:)"" you should be fine.

Am more than capable to take care of my hygien and work, and as soon as I get home I try to keep as busy as possible. Working out, studying French with Duolingo, meditation, and sometimes computer games and films. However films tend to make my brain think. A lot. So I cannot watch films as much as I did before. But keeping busy generally helps, especially seeing progress in Duolingo and being able to understand texts more and more. Also I try to activate myself as much as possible at work; by talking to colleagues and doing tasks. 

Try to find something small that you can see progress in, like working out, or a studying a language perhaps.

For me at least the feeling of being drained at the and of the day helps me sleep so I guess it's a small victory, it seems a lot of us have problems sleeping so I feel lucky in a way."
