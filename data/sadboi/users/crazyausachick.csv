ptsd,fr09uzb,t3_glupw9,1589788287.0,"Hi, I’ve had acute ptsd since 2007, recovered in 2012, and then developed it again in 2017 from another event. My symptoms were abnormal the second time around and they have created what feels like ptsd on top of ptsd. I never thought I’d be ok again, that the world would never feel normal or real. I still have those days- where the panic and terror just takes over and I am back re-living it and I believe i am dying. 

But the change is that it’s less often, or I come back to reality a little quicker, or it might not be as intense. Not as many flashbacks, not as much dissociation or derealization. Less suicidal ideation. 

Observing the times where you are not doing well and reflecting back with “was this episode longer or shorter, more or less intense or intrusive” can help you identify, slowly, how you’re doing. Always being aware that you will still have your bad days- but this doesn’t mean you’re going backwards, it’s just the insidious nature of ptsd. 

Everyone’s experience with ptsd is different, learning your triggers and identifying what helps you mitigate them as best you can is important. 

Outside of therapy, I do suggest a weighted blanket (an air force friend recommended this to me) and if we are ever allowed back out, float therapy. 

One of the biggest things that helped me was also education about ptsd.

Message me if you want to talk further."
ptsd,fqsbg50,t3_gkkegb,1589602916.0,"I have both depersonalization and derealization. So severe I lose the ability to know where I am and believe I’m in limbo between life or death. I’ve been taken to the ER because of it and eventually started doing things like wandering around the ER (no idea how I disconnected myself from all the machines) and not knowing the day or year. I still get it in waves, when I get waves of terror or panic or sometimes I just wake up that way. 

I finally rationalized it as ... this is what I would have felt if I wasn’t so dissociated during the event. I’m just feeling it now.

Edit: To be clear, I either don’t feel real - or nothing is familiar or real around me. But that’s a simplistic way to describe the actual experience."

My B12 and Vit D were exceedingly low and my thyroid kept going up and down. I got re tested for bacteria and parasites and it came back negative.

I have experienced other types of dissociation without thinking or talking about trauma, often derealization or depersonalization but it’s not helpful to dissociate during therapy as you don’t process what you are there to process.

This belief is what what stops rape and sexual abuse victims from ever reporting. Your ignorance is incredible. You’re also not even considering the fight, flight or freeze response. It’s not just about being “too nice” to let it happen, it’s a change in your brain in terms of how you may or may not response to an event you may perceive as dangerous, especially if you’ve experienced abuse before. 

Honestly, people like you should be ashamed of your selves. You’re effectively bringing up the “she wore a short skirt so she deserved it” argument, just with different words. 

Imagine if gender roles were reversed. 

Express your opinion all you want, just expect to get negative responses to it. 

As a rape victim myself, I could always say “why didn’t I do this, or why did I do this?”, but never, in any way, is it ok to say the perpetrators behavior is driven by anyone but themselves. I didn’t make them do what they did. It was a conscious choice they made.
