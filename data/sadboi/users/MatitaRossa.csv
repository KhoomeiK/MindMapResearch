raisedbynarcissists,fpwrw60,t1_fpvapxc,1588968845.0,"My mother refused to let me wear contact lenses when I was 16 because in her very informed opinion (she is a hairdresser and only got to go to school until she was 14) ""you need to be at least 18 to wear contact lenses, it's too early now"". 
I already had horrible paranoias about my appearance, to the point I would actively avoid mirrors not to look at myself. I look bad with glasses. I just didn't want to feel even more bad about myself but no, an ignorant hairdresser decided I had to."
raisedbynarcissists,fn6nfxb,t1_fn3rcqy,1586703441.0,"Same for me. 
According to all my friends, flatmates, colleagues and guys I dated I'm chill and laid-back, I don't complain much, I never take things personally and I am fun to be around.I am also considered very open minded and curious and I'm appreciated for being able to strongly defend my point of view in a discussion without resorting to attacking or disrespectful the other person. Many people like me for being responsible, pro active, and very reliable when something needs to be don.

According to my parents (and I quote), I am stubborn, rude, touchy, I am always angry and irritated, it's impossible to say anything to me without me overreacting, I complain about everything all the time, I am never happy and always in a bad mood. Most heard phrases: ""nobody will ever want you if you don't change"" and ""I'm sorry for the poor guy that will end up with you and will have to bear with your bossy and rude attitude""."
nosurf,fl9g2yp,t3_fn9ecy,1584954098.0,"I'm with you! I put timers on my phone for Instagram and Facebook, I'm only allowed 30mins each per day.


I also decided to give up on activities I had planned like organising my room and stuff.
I hate cleaning and organising and I come from months of mental exhaustion (for family and study reasons): it's of no use to force me to do something I hate only to end up spending the day on my phone procrastinating what I have to do. 

I can live a few more weeks with stuff on my desk, my mental health is more important."

depression,fl74ojz,t3_fmuipb,1584894168.0,"Tbh I spent my life struggling to make friends and thinking I was ""wrong"". I am very sensitive and could see that people found me weird somehow. In every environment I was, I found myself to be like the others on some points... But then there was some things that made me stand out like a sore thumb. My view on some topics or my way to do things or my approach to people .

I kept hating myself for not being able to be normal and make friends. I thought I just deserved to be alone unless I learned to change.


I then moved away, got into rave/techno music, met most of my friends through that, and I am just now realising that I just had to find the right environment. 

Ye, we're all quite weird. But we all get along and most importantly, we understand and accept each other for what we are.


If there's something you like like music or art or whatever, it's a billion times easier to make friends through common interest, just find a local community. You can also try a new sport or activity.

Don't try to be friends with people you don't click with or that don't want you. I wasted too much time trying to fit in, and please don't do that, you'll just feel even worse and think you're wrong.


You're not wrong. There's no reason you should be unhappy. Be friendly with everybody, but don't force it. Take your time to find your best friends."
depression,fl72m9w,t1_fl67hxc,1584892714.0,"> Why do you think we havenâ€™t adjusted to the world properly? Because the ones who were supposed to love and care for us broke us instead.


Oh shit I'm with you on this SO. MUCH. 
Was mercilessly bullied in school as a kid, not only from my peers but even more so by my teachers. 
Nobody seemed to realise that a 12yo that doesn't make friends with others and is often acting strange or overreacting, is not ""an arrogant person that thinks she is better than others and that she knows best"".

 
I was fucking twelve. 
I was just lost and scared, trying to cope.
How can you be 40+ and think that a kid that doesn't speak to his peers is not shy or scared or whatever, but ""arrogant""."
depression,fks3eje,t1_fkq3fa8,1584481464.0,"Currently searching for some side job that can be done online. There are a lot of options, copywriting/general writing stuff for ppl, translation, graphic designing, social media managing, also anything IT like web dev, software dev etc. Teaching (language, playing an instrument, cooking etc) are also an option

I'm going that way personally, so far I can just say there are a billion options so really search the web and find one or two things that match your skillset and/or previous experience

And good luck, we will make it sis/bro"
depression,fkpbmcm,t3_fjthj0,1584406270.0,"With you on that. Was almost getting a job, but I only have experience (albeit a soldi 3y experience) as a server and all bars and restaurants are not only the first ones to close down, but will probably remain so for much longer than any other job or activity for obvious reasons.
I'm probably never gonna get a job before summer and I'm not even sure I'll get it then.
My savings are running out.
I was so close."

I mean welcome to my world, maybe you'll understand what it means being depressed for months and feeling stuck."
depression,fk708so,t1_fk68u5c,1583923497.0,"Ah this hits home So. Hard.
Was very heavily bullied by my peers all through middle school, teachers wouldn't defend me but actually abuse me even more thinking I was arrogant and snob. My parents thought I was arrogant and mean and that was the reason my peers didn't like me. I was just not talking and not interacting with people out of goddamn fear.

I was so afraid of human interaction that the only reason I would get out of the house was to walk my dog. It would usually require at least 1/1.5 hours to mentally prepare and work up the motivation to tackle the world and go walk the dog. I lived in a small, empty town and would go walk in the woods, away from people, trying to hide my face those rare times I met someone.

It took me about 12 years to be able to be a normal human being again and fully be able to do things like have friends and be able to meet people without fear, stress or paranoia."
loseit,ewozhhd,t1_ewooz6a,1565630139.0,"Shit yeah. Fortunately being young, working as a server and hiking/biking a lot kept things under control for me, but I still gained 8kg in the last year.
I just decide to lose that weight and the first thing I'm doing is cutting every unnecessary snack: buying a chocolate bar while I'm out running errands, eating a ton of biscuits with my morning coffee, snacking on cheese, bread and stuff while making dinner, eating a muffin after dinner. I would maybe eat a normal portion of rice and veggies for lunch, but then snack on random stuff so much to make it a double meal. Not to consider how much I usually eat while studying. It's crazy. 

I would spend a LOT of money, which as a student is not really affordable. 
My main goal right now is not even to lose weight per se, but to stop this craze of not being able to go a few hours without constantly thinking about eating or totally losing control in front of food. 
And I want to have money to do fun and interesting activity instead of wasting them to get fat on unhealthy snacks"
