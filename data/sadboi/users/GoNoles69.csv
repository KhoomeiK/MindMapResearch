It really started up in February and just continued to get worse. She was honest with me about how she was feeling back then and said her mind messes with how she feels about me, I told her I didn’t care, that I loved her and I would be there for her through it all (we were living together).  She broke up with me around June, saying I deserve better , that she has been unhappy with herself, she doesn’t feel like herself anymore. The very next day she came back crying, saying she was sorry and made a mistake and didn’t want us to be over, and that she will work on herself and that she loved me. The most recent breakup was over the same things. She blindsided me with this breakup, I thought things were so much better but she said the same stuff. She said how she needs to be alone to find her happiness, which I understand. She has been so cold to me since the breakup it’s painful. I just want her to know if she feels like she made a mistake, I am here for her. If she feels like she needs someone, I am here for her.

What confuses me is how she was acting days up to the breakup, how she was still acting like she loved me and everything was ok, and the fact that we were already in agreeence to just sign the lease (we did talk about other options, etc) and all the talks about “our” future weeks leading up to the breakup.

I am not big on social media, and she was on it all damn day, so I wasn't sure if it was common to remove pictures, and just the whole ""No Contact / Doesn't even want to see me"" thing makes everything kind of confusing to me. One minute we are in love and the next everything is over."

She has always had little spouts of depression, but about 4months into living together it got real bad, she started going to therapy and shared with me what was going on in her head.

Around 4 months ago she broke up with me for the same reason as recently, but the next day came back crying saying she was sorry and didn’t want our relationship to be over. I thought we were doing great, but she ended it again over the same stuff... she didn’t love herself, and feels she needs to be alone to find her happiness within herself. I told her I loved her, I’m in love with her but I understood. I am still waiting on her to come back but now that it’s almost been 3 weeks I am unsure... especially after the way she is talking to me and doesn’t want to see me. 

All of our friends are just telling me she needs time to prove to herself she isn’t codependent and is her own person, but that just leaves me as collateral damage.. I thought we had a future together.. she’s 25 and I’m 28 just for reference. 

What is crazy is the days and weeks leading up to the breakup she was still telling me she loved me, cuddling with me in bed, just like everything was fine.

So that’s another reason I was naive enough to think she would come back, because she would realize the mistake she made.

relationship_advice,f21duea,t1_f21bo7g,1569871047.0,"This is something I didn't want to hear, but needed too. 

What makes it tough is that she has been suffering from mental health issues for a little, with that being depression/abandonment issues/no self worth. I think a combination of all that plus the guilt of knowing I was putting some of the things that made me happy to the side for her happiness, drove her away. 

But it also makes it harder to come to reality. Sometimes I am unsure if she made a rash-decision in a low point of her life, or she has been thinking of this for a while. The problem was SHE was the one who was so down to re-sign the lease, SHE was the one who was interested in looking at renting a house so we could have more room, but at the end of the day SHE didn't want to have to move again. But here we are... 

It hurts knowing that she might of been faking her love for me this entire time. Even on Monday and Tuesday we were telling each other we love each other, kissing each other, cuddling in bed watching TV before sleep and kissing each other goodnight/good morning.

We still have 2 months on our apartment lease together but I am staying at my parents for now because she doesnt even want to see me, she tries to avoid me basically.

If she began a relationship with someone else I would never go back though. You cant tell me you cant be with me because you need to be alone to figure things out, then jump back into another relationship, that would kill me.

I am not ready to move on just yet, and still am hurting a lot, but no matter how much I want her back, I know she needs to seek the help she needs, and if she believes she needs to be alone to figure that out then she will either get better or realize I had nothing to do with it.

I think she would need to explain to me what is going on in her head and communicate with me more.

miamidolphins,eyw7xzj,t3_cyxins,1567523105.0,53man roster update Thursday 🙌🏼.Time for the Rebuild
miamidolphins,eyqim63,t1_eyqg4v4,1567344320.0,"Ideally.... Rosen will show hes a franchise QB, and we can use our top pick on Dline and then rebuild our Oline.

If Preston Williams turns out to be good, we wont have to spend a pick on a WR either."
miamidolphins,eypoigk,t1_eypnnwh,1567306198.0,"This to me kind of shows that we are moving for Tua. I agree with everything you said, with the QB and LT being the two most important offensive positions... BUT if we are going for the lefty in Tua, the RT position gains value due to the blind side issues. That, and LT might of been requesting to be the highest paid LT."
miamidolphins,eyp0hwg,t3_cy13u4,1567286979.0,Is this a fucking joke
OCLions,eygus9w,t1_eyfjwnc,1567077013.0,"Thats actually a pretty good way to look at it. Thank you for the insight. I just feel that the level of play in the MLS is good enough for players to be effective out if college (Larin, etc). Anyone know if the Brazil league is more competitive? 

I see the want to sell and purchase someone to help now. I just hope that means Tesho stays, even with the bad game against ATL."
OCLions,eye85zo,t3_cwqdln,1567030123.0,"Why... when one of our issues is capitalizing chances. Dom has regressed, hes more into diving and starting fights. Tesho is a good option but we beed another striker with Benji playing more on the wing."
orlando,eydexxr,t1_eydd76l,1567017446.0,"Lmao right

Edit: I saw he said he will answer our questions tomorrow at 7pm"
miamidolphins,eycghtw,t1_ey95z0o,1567001577.0,"I looked it up and you are absolutely correct. He passed the deadline for an extension by not singing the franchise tag. BUT, if we were able to send them a 3rd and a player (not named leremy tunsil) we would free up the cap of that player, and if he left after a year, we would be compensated a 3rd round pick in the following draft. So if we sent someone like Stills or Jones or even Kiko we would basically be freeing up long-term cap penalties for immediate relief and getting our pick back."
miamidolphins,ey9ff48,t3_cw9qpm,1566942099.0,SIGN DA THING
miamidolphins,ey94jyq,t1_ey92vul,1566935091.0,I would imagine we wouldnt do it without a long term extension. Kind of like what happened with Landry to the Browns
classicwow,ey6wun1,t1_ey6wowl,1566865767.0,Same
classicwow,ey6kiwj,t1_ey6kcbi,1566857723.0,Im right there with you lol. 354min que at 615pm
classicwow,ey5px8y,t1_ey5pejw,1566837581.0,"I believe since the name reservation period they have opened 2 new East PVP servers with one more coming in an hour. Thats just East PVP.

You mean you want more than that?"
classicwow,ey5p71n,t1_ey5p4f5,1566837096.0,"They are, they are dropping one a few hours prior to server launch."
classicwow,ey5hqtm,t1_ey5hjka,1566831961.0,"I think it was also a tool used by Blizzard to see how many people were actually going to play classic to determine the number of servers.

They knew there was a hardcore and casual following to classic, with a decent % being willing to save their old character name and with a decent % not caring about that and just making a toon after the release date.

This allowed for all the new servers you have seen recently to be put online. Imagine if NONE of those servers were available until after launch day... that would of been a MESS."
classicwow,ey5aoud,t1_ey4zuzy,1566826788.0,I think they are dropping the new servers today to give the people who didnt reserve names to be able to decide on one of the newer servers
classicwow,ext0mhx,t3_cuawx1,1566560612.0,People like us who reserved our names is the reason we will have more servers open at launch...
MMORPG,exq4guz,t1_exq40kc,1566497784.0,"Have it beat? Lol

People racing to 60 are a smaller majority man. You obviously are stating your opinion on something you know nothing about."
MMORPG,exq2izq,t1_expz86m,1566497114.0,"Seeing how WoW classic content is going to be released over 6 different phases, and the first phase is expected to last 3-5months.... i dont see how they “Expect to be done with it” in less than 30days...

This was an ignorant statement to say the least."
classicwow,exldpa7,t3_ctc116,1566411016.0,I am! Never played Tauren and never leveled in Mulgore im excited!
OrlandoMagic,exkiu1n,t1_exjt6zt,1566390846.0,Would you mind DMing me their contact info as well? I am also interested.
conspiracy,exjrx7x,t3_ct67ah,1566358572.0,One simply does not CASUALLY do heroin.
Austin,exeqkog,t3_csgeqk,1566222934.0,How does she do with the harness if you dont mind me asking?
Madden,excjubm,t3_crz5as,1566152440.0,All-Madden life
AnimalsBeingDerps,ex3u0ll,t3_cr6i4i,1565991550.0,"Is this the place in Gainesville, FL?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,ex3aibx,t1_ex2weou,1565982552.0,Is it though?
OCLions,ex0b7bi,t1_ex063of,1565908790.0,"Being this bad for 5 years, honestly the only place to go is up..."
Madden,ewzlqhz,t1_ewymlw5,1565897489.0,Ya I got selected by the dolphins with the 24th pick of the 1st round.
OCLions,ewzl6bl,t1_ewzkvo2,1565897279.0,"I think some of the initial hype got people who were not necessarily soccer fans to become fans of the team, and as we began to be sub-par season after season the Hype and the Pride fell off for those individuals. I have been a season ticket holder since our inaugural season, and I would be lying if I didnt say I have gotten frustrated multiple times watching our team. Especially when the opposing team scores in the final minute of the game countless times."
