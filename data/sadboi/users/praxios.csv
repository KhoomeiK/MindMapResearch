TripSit,ff6ehtv,t1_ff5olnm,1579625445.0,"That's mainly due to the fact that LSD and MDMA bind to your serotonin receptors differently.

MDMA will bind to the serotonin receptors and it initiates the mass release of all the stored serotonin (this is where the awesome euphoria comes from). However, when you release all your serotonin at once it takes a while to replenish back to normal levels, hence the molly hangover.

LSD is a bit more complicated on the science side of things, but in layman terms, rather than it initiating the mass release of serotonin what it does is acts as a ""trap door"". It traps your serotonin within the receptor while releasing small amounts throughout your trip. And once the LSD unbinds from the receptor 8-12 hours later your serotonin receptor will have a bit of an overabundance of serotonin to release, hence the ""LSD afterglow"" the day after a trip.

However everyone's brain chemistry is different, so this won't be the case across the board for everyone."
TripSit,ff52zw3,t3_erobfx,1579578828.0,"My most introspective moments with psychedelics usually come towards the end of my trips. You're finally through the peak and can function semi-normally again, but your brain is still in hyperdrive. And this is perfectly okay!

If you are able, maybe try journaling your trip for a bit! Looking back on what you learned and how you plan to apply it is a great way to pull yourself out of this funk.

They had gotten an apartment together a couple years before they broke up. My brother paid for 90% of the bills, groceries, and almost all of the furniture aside from a coffee table and a couch. She broke up with him when he accused her of cheating (which she was, with at least 6 other men). She stonewalled the fuck out of him trying to prevent him from taking anything from the apartment. My brother being the pushover he was at the time just let her steamroll him and get her way. Until my mom and I stepped in.

It's SO IMPORTANT in situations like this to find a friend or family member to go with you over to the place to pick up the rest of your belongings. It will ensure you guys don't interact and if there's any issues on his end (such as not letting you take your stuff YOU BOUGHT) then your friends or family can help mediate the situation, so you don't have to in your emotional state. At one point you did share those belongings with him, but when he made the decision to break up, he also made the decision to break up with all of your belongings. He is not entitled to anything he didn't buy himself, and I can tell you from experience that having to rebuy things that you once owned sucks. 

I know this is the hardest part of a breakup, but surround yourself with friends, keep yourself busy with your favorite hobbies, and most importantly go get what's rightfully yours. This is the end of a relationship that wasn't meant to be, but it absolutely doesn't mean you'll find something better down the road. Keep your head up, you'll get through this I promise üíú"

Since you're both still new to sex, foreplay is something that will take a lot of practice to achieve the goal you want. Communicate to your partner what feels good and what doesn't, let them know if they should increase the intensity or slow down, and be honest if you don't have an orgasm.

It might hurt their feelings at first, but he won't learn what to change unless you tell him. If he can't learn through communication, try telling him what feels best when you masturbate on your own, or better yet, SHOW HIM.

If you are worried about your safety, I would consider this an option as well. However, I never had an option since I didn't have emotional support to help me through my grandpa passing.

I'm sure you are familiar with the 5 stages of grief? If not I would recommend familiarizing yourself with it because it will help you navigate how you're feeling a bit. Most likely you are in the denial stage at the moment, in disbelief and shock about what happened. This is perfectly normal, but it's soooooooo important that you surround yourself with your loved ones right now. Surrounding yourself with love won't fill the empty hole in your chest right now, but it will make the pain a little more bearable. 

Whatever you do, do NOT keep these feelings bottled up. Once you are ready (it may not be possible to talk about so soon and that's ok üíú) talk to somebody you trust about the feelings you are going through.

I had to do all my own research for my med card a couple years back. I got lucky because I worked at a vape shop that medical dispensary reps would come by all the time to drop off information. Most medical states will have websites that list medical providers that can give you a med card. I would also make sure you look up your state's medical laws before you decide to find a doctor for your medical card. Also the price of $300 is a little higher than what you will see. If you're insured the doctor visit and the card will most likely range $100-200 rather than $300."

Every state runs it's medical marijuana programs differently, so what qualifies me for a medical card here may not qualify you there. I'd look into seeing if bipolar is an illness you can get a med card for in your state. If you can get a med card for a disability you can get the cost of the med card offset a bit. 

Although with more states legalizing recreationally it honestly might be worth it just to wait until it's recreational in your state. Black market weed is definitely cheaper than dispensary, but there's no guarantee that the black market dealer isn't growing weed in their own backyard using harmful pesticides. Once weed is recreational it will also be considerably cheaper than medical dispensary prices (like $10 a gram kind of cheap for bottom shelf quality)."

Dabs will actually get me high, relax my anxiety (yes somehow a sativa does that don't ask me how lol), they keep me asleep through the night, I can actually eat without feeling the need to barf right after.

While sativas help my mania, they could make yours worse. Which is why it's important to try a sativa and indica separately and determine which strain type improves your symptoms best. THC affects everyone differently; some bodies metabolize it quicker while some slower. For example my body metabolizes THC at a very fast rate so lower potency strains aren't nearly as effective for me, whereas my friend who is the same height and weight as me can smoke a bowl of low potency bud and be sky high for hours. Potency and strains work differently for everyone, and it's especially important to be aware of how it affects us since bipolar can make smoking weed very helpful or very dangerous if not properly informed.

I'd recommend trying a sativa to start with, Jack Herer and Sour Diesel are staple sativa strains, and common in black markets of illegal states. My personal favorite for indica's is Blue Dream, also another common black market strain. Once you've tried each respectively I'd try out a hybrid. Then compare notes on them all and decide which worked best for you. I also recommend surfing through Leafly and reading up on all the information they have on there. Beyond the strain info they have excellent information regarding the chemistry of marijuana and how it affects the body. Hope this helps :)"
BipolarReddit,f5rr0bq,t1_f5rq17d,1572400874.0,"It's hard trying to smoke in an illegal state (my state is illegal until next year), so it's near impossible to pick and choose strains that work best. 

Personally I stuck with sativas and hybrids, I also smoked concentrates only (oil not bud) so the potency was considerably higher than smoking regular bud. Everyone is different so it will take some experimenting with different types of strains to see what works best. Sativas and hybrids work best for me because it makes my mania considerably more manageable and it does a great deal for my energy during horrible depressive episodes. 

Personally from what I've experienced and others with our illness, I've found that higher strain potencies work best for tackling the worst symptoms of bipolar, but once again it's subjective to each person and their body chemistry. Most black market bud will range anywhere from 5-15% whereas black market concentrates (NOT DAB PENS) will range from 50-80% thc potency. 

Availability will be your biggest roadblock, but if you can find a dealer who cares enough to know what strains they are selling you can look them up on Leafly and keep track of the strains you try in a notebook to narrow down what works best for you :)"

Here she had yet another contender for the throne before her, and a Targaryen at that. 

Regardless of how much Daenerys saved their asses in the Great War, it still doesn't change the fact that Sansa and Arya were right about her. She lived up to her name and completely wiped out ALL of King's Landing. And why? Oh yeah cuz Cersei is a cunt (big surprise there lol) and killed Missandei while Daenerys was still grieving about her dragons. Are you possibly suggesting that Daenerys was in the right for wiping out King's Landing? 

Sansa, Ayra, and Varys are the only ones who see Daenerys for what she is in season 8. Everyone else was too terrified of her to even defy her (ie. Tyrion who later betrays Varys due to this fear). I'm not sure how you can even suggest that Sansa is stupid because she saw through Daenerys false ""liberator"" guise. Sansa knows what a monster looks like almost better than everyone else, so she was right to be stubborn about what her feelings were about Daenerys. 

If Daenerys followed in Aegon's footsteps (which she already did by burning everyone in King's Landing), she would have murdered Sansa and Arya before she left Winterfell. How likely do you think it would have been for Jon to continue following Daenerys after she just murdered his sisters? I'm gonna take a gander here and say not very likely lol. As a matter of fact, even just the suggestion that Daenerys makes after wiping out the capital, where she plans to ""liberate"" all those who defy her was alarming enough for Jon to commit treason. 

Sansa had every right to call out Daenerys for what she was. She already had her family wiped out once by monstrous dictators, you really think she was willing to let that happen again with what little family she had left?

NoStupidQuestions,f4oyamo,t3_dkxz7c,1571711177.0,"My great grandma wasn't a construction worker, but she was one of the first who ever worked on the highest floors of the Sears Tower in Chicago. 

These floors were the ones that granted the Sears Tower the award for one of the tallest buildings in the world at the time. While my great grandma worked there while the project was ongoing, she frequently interacted with the construction workers. 

She was an incredibly charismatic woman, and a lot of people liked her. She ended up befriending one of the foremen on the construction project and he offered to have my grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles, and my moms' names engraved in the final floors of the tower. 

Although these names aren't visible, my mom's family will always have a deep connection to the Sear's Tower.  And even though my great grandma passed years ago, I'm reminded of the wonderful woman she was everytime I make a trip to the city and see the Sears Tower."
freefolk,f4ge7cg,t1_f4fm0qk,1571580217.0,"Maybe because she was scared shitless? I distinctly remember Tyrion starting to have doubts in that moment about his lovely queen as well. 

Sansa had every reason to be upset with Jon for swearing allegiance to someone who just showed up in Westeros claiming they deserved the throne. The last person that believed they deserved the throne due to birthright ended up being an evil bastard lol. 

Sansa cared about Jon and was very suspicious of Dany, and rightly so. If Sansa remained passive and let Jon do whatever he wanted the outcome would have been exactly the same.

I just don't understand why all the hate is directed towards Sansa, who was one of the few who had the goddamn sense to call out Dany for what she was. Even Arya agreed with Sansa's stance on the matter. 

If y'all want to hate a character just because she had a moment of weakness during a moment of life and death, then I don't know what to tell ya.

In my opinion it was right for Sansa to be frustrated in that moment. But that's what any of this is, an OPINION. So go ahead and keep downvoting me. I said my piece, and there's no use in continuing to argue with people who are painfully stubborn on the matter lol."

I partially think a lot of Sansa's coldness in the show (that made her a Walmart Cersei) was an acting decision on Sophie Turner's part. I've personally never been a huge fan of book to movie/show adaptations because a lot of writers and actors never do my favorite characters justice (ie, Hermione). 

It still didn't change the fact that Sansa was one of my favorite characters in the show because she was one of the few characters that wasn't constantly flipping back and forth about what she believed in (of course aside from her character development into the badass we came to know in season 8). My girl doesn't deserve the hate she's been getting because she was probably one of the best written characters in season 8 (which is a goddamn travesty because so many amazing characters got the shaft)"

It's exhausting seeing all the hate for Sansa. She's the only one of the Stark's that ACTUALLY saw her father wrongly executed. She saw firsthand her family's worst enemies plotting to destroy her family and she was completely powerless.

I've seen them well over 8 times now and their production and mixing get better every set. If you can I'd recommend seeing them on their tour as opposed to a festival set. Their tour sets are astronomically better (although their Forest set this year was one of the best sets I saw this year)

Vaping101,f1lejzs,t1_f1kc81r,1569552694.0,"Are you buying juice pre-nic'd or do they add nicotine to a 0? I find that pre nic'd juices tend to be a little rougher on coils since the glycerin has steeped for longer with the nicotine, so your coil life will suffer a bit. However if you're only getting a couple days out of the coils, then it's not a juice issue, it's the coils.

Also my experience with the Vaporesso GT coils is that they are just very poorly made. I was having a customer come in at least once a week because every pack they had almost always had at least one dud in it. While that's not a situation you can avoid with any tank, a pack of 3 coils having 1 dud every pack is just costing you more in the long run. 

My recommendation is that when you buy your next pack of these coils, clean your tank THOROUGHLY. Rinse it in some hot water and make sure it's bone dry before you install the new coil. Make sure the new coil is prepped well and let it sit in the juice for 30 minutes before you hit it. Also make sure you are using the recommended wattage on the coil. If you go above or below the wattage the coil recommends it will affect coil life. If you continue to have the issue after these fixes I would just say maybe it's time to shop around for a new tank."

BipolarReddit,f1edve5,t3_d90h5x,1569419937.0,"It took me THREE psychologists before I found out I had bipolar. I was misdiagnosed three separate times by doctors who didn't have as deep of an understanding of our illness as they should. 

While bipolar can be a very debilitating illness, it honestly also makes us stronger than the average person. We are conditioned to wade through days upon days of hellish mania and depression, so if I would rather have had a doctor with experience with the illness (the psych that actually diagnosed me properly had a son with bipolar 1).

Society likes to shun anyone they deem as weak, but one thing that's absolutely NOT acceptable is your workplace discriminating against you for your illness. That is not only ILLEGAL, but a direct violation of the Disability Act. If you are required to report any illnesses before taking a job as a psychologist, they have no power to act as if you're any less qualified because of your disability. Bipolar is no different than a life debilitating physical disorder.

 If this kind of discrimination continues I recommend shopping around for a new job that will actually appreciate the experience you have to offer to your job. Your experiences make or break your abilities as a good therapist, and in my opinion I'd pick you as my therapist over any self-entitled quack who read about bipolar in a book, and think they understand everything about the illness. (Definitely report their asses too for violation of the disability act because that's a BIG NO NO)."

Too many politicians are bought out by Big Tobacco, so the flavor bans are in their best interests to make more money. There are plenty of great candidates out there that are out for all of our best interests and want to actually make a difference for the WHOLE country. We are at an impasse where flavors are going to start being banned nationwide regardless of how the election goes. The damage has already been done in terms of the witch hunt against vaping. It will unfortunately be a long term fight for our rights as citizens. 

Once upon a time even cigarettes and alcohol were put in the spotlight for being dangerous, and bans were placed on them. The only way those bans were reversed was because the PEOPLE spoke up. We as a community are NOT making enough noise. CALL YOUR STATE REPRESENTATIVES. MAKE YOUR COMPLAINTS HEARD. SHARE MEDICAL STUDIES THAT PROVE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF VAPING OVER CIGARETTES. This is going to be a long, hard fight and if we lose our fire as more states jump on the flavor ban bandwagon, then we are letting Big Tobacco win. 

All it takes is a simple google search to get your state representatives numbers and emails. While they may not read every complaint, they keep track of the amount of calls and emails surrounding a specific issue. Blow these greedy assholes up, get your friends to blow them up. Keep fighting and we can make our voices heard."

askdrugs,erki8ol,t3_c2ebuv,1560964043.0,"I think you need to sit down with your friend and talk to him about his abuse of mdma. 

I've been there. Taking a lot of it, and frequently may not present negative side affects right away (although he already is experiencing symptoms of lack of serotonin), but the longer this continues, the more irreversible the damage is. 

MDMA can be extremely neurotoxic, and when it's abused like that, it can cause lifetime mental health problems because it wears down a lot on your serotonin receptors. You can always take more and force your brain to release the serotonin, but after a while your brain will have nothing left and he will lose the magic. 

I know people sound like broken records saying to follow the 3 month rule for taking MDMA, but it's honestly the safest bet for avoiding any long term damage to your brain. Even waiting a month between rolls and taking more responsible doses (usually under .2) is a lot safer than multiple times a month. 

I would talk to your buddy about taking a step back from it for a bit before the problem gets out of hand. Recommend some 5htp supplements to stimulate some serotonin production to help with the post-roll depression (although absolutely DO NOT let him take it unless it's at least 12-24 hours after a roll). 

MDMA is a fun drug, but it's a lot more fun when used responsibly. I wish you both luck and I hope you can help your friend out üíú"

I think if you guys want your own quilt and feel left out, you should look into making your own! You can make a fun project out of it with your husband and you will be free to add your dogs, or anything you wanted.
