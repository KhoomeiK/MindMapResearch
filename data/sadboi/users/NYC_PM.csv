As an investor I try to divorce myself from my own feelings and try to understand how the masses will react. Your original post was about the economic impacts. Right now we can blame economic impact on government shutdowns. But what would consumer confidence have looked like if there was no shutdown, no federal guidance? How many individuals would have chosen to leave their homes and conduct business as usual? Would THAT level of demand have been enough to combat the unprecedented economic contraction we’re experiencing? I don’t think so. 

Again, going into this event we had a consumer lead economy. The dead bodies in freezer trucks make a lot of people not want to go outside (not you, but other people). Also stories of your coworker coughing up blood on his desk. Another coworker lost two aunts and a young cousin. 8/10 people would stay home voluntarily I think. The brave individuals like yourself with strong moral conviction would have continued to live normally, but the average person would not.

Outstanding ETHE shs ~ 5.4mm
Outstanding GBTC shs ~ 293mm

Shares don’t start to trade on the secondary until a private placement holder sells into the secondary, providing liquidity. When GBTC was fairly newer, the premium was much more volatile. I remember GBTC trading at 450% premium in December of 2017, when there was far less liquidity. 

Grayscale just kept funding the GBTC pool, creating more shares until they could find an equilibrium at 130% premium. There’s something about that 130% premium, it’s as if the market makers are supporting that number as to provide a buffer for it trading at a discount if market conditions sour. Both ETHE and ETCG first started trading on the secondary around 130% premium. 

It’s back down to 116% right now because of macro uncertainty within crypto and also the world coming to an end/global liquidity crisis. What I’m watching to gauge enthusiasm is the GBTC premium fluctuating around that target 130% premium. If GBTC starts to trade at 140% premium I’m going to unload my positions."

A few months ago I read the children’s story, The Velveteen Rabbit. It focuses on a rabbit who desperately wants to become Real. At the beginning of the story the rabbit is told that becoming real “doesn’t happen all at once... you become, it takes a long time... but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always.” 

That gives me some comfort, I hope it’s comforting to you. Don’t give up, we will become Real and have a personal identity of our own one day."

Dissociation,fo6krx7,t1_fo5xr8g,1587561231.0,"Fanfiction are fictional stories based off an already existing canon (world). Some readers/writers might be fans of a particular movie, tv show, book, or other work of fiction, so much so that they want to continue to immerse themselves in the story beyond the bounds of the original story itself. Maybe you fixate on a romantic couple or potential romantic couple in the story, maybe you see yourself in one of the characters, you would want to rewrite their story OR read about someone who has rewritten their story. 

When I was very little, I loved the movie Ever After. In the end the farm girl goes on to marry the prince and live happily ever after (spoiler for a great movie, sorry). But I wasn’t satisfied that the movie hadn’t shown more of the emotional circumstances surrounding her conquering her circumstances. I wanted to see more of the reassurance that the prince loved her despite the fact that she grew up in the dirt on a farm, and wasn’t worthy of him on the surface. I wanted to see the actual romance and process of his acceptance of her, more than I wanted to see the happily ever after. So I started imaging extra scenes to the movie in my head. And to my delight, some months later I discovered fanfiction.net and entire archive of stories from every fictional universe you could ever imagine. Now I read stories from the Harry Potter universe, game of thrones, even momentarily popular ones like succession on HBO. 

I’ve heard that 50 shades of gray is a fanfiction piece from the Twilight universe. The author imagined that Bella and Edward lived in an alternate universe where Edward was a multimillionaire and Bella met him on a job interview, after which they fell in love along the story lines of 50 shades. FF writers can take the characters they love and put them in any new scenario of fantasy. And as readers we’re able to pick up a new story and be engaged immediately because we know the characters so well. 

Another great site is archiveofourown.org

I started seriously dating the first bumble date I went on, and we were together for a year and a half. When I told my ex I was seeing someone he stopped communicating with me. 
My relationship fell apart over the holidays, about a month ago at this point. Strange thing is I don’t miss this recent ex at all, after spending a year and a half with him. I never stopped thinking about my long time love, even thought I tried my hardest to put him out of my head. I looked him up on social media and it looks like he has a serious girlfriend that moved in with him the week my relationship ended. Go figure, I’m currently sitting with my emotions and debating reaching out and stating my feelings. What a mess! 

I realized that I can be single in reality but in a relationship in my mind if that makes sense. I think even though we were broken up I was never really alone because I always had that connection to my love. All of my subsequent relationships revolved around my attachment to my original guy. I keep going after guys that are the opposite of my first love, I’m not sure if that’s because I’m trying to drive him out of my mind or if I’m trying to preserve space for him. He’s artsy and creative and I’ve never pursued another relationship with that kind of person even though it’s complimentary to my math oriented organized mind. 

My therapist’s theory is that I am enmeshed with my mother and haven’t detached myself from her, and since my long time love reminds me of my mother that’s one more way I can remain attached to her. 

Total mess, good luck to us all!"

We never got back together because the reasons we broke up were still valid (we didn’t want the same things in life). 

Because he was in my life and one of my closest friends, I was never able to fully move on with someone else, or even just with myself.

After that initial discussion with my friend at the bar we found out about several other women in quick succession. If you hook up with this guy you’re just one more woman at the company he’s been with, probably in the same weekend if he meets his personal goals.

I would say this guy loves the fact that you’re married and might mess up your marriage just for one night with him. The more pain and suffering you endure by being with him, the more satisfying it will be for him. An NPD will see you’re sacrifices as a reflection of him, “I’m so special that she was willing to do anything to be with me”. My guy would tell me what a horrible person he was, that he was fat, had a small penis. And the fact that I still wanted him after all that made the victory that much more appealing for him"
BPD,feo98dy,t3_eq5tm4,1579296782.0,"I’ve been in a very similar situation at work with a uNPD man, he was older than me and much higher up. We work in a bank and he flat out told me that if I told anyone what was happening between us I would get fired, not him, because he was more valuable to the firm.

Only after 3 years of on off “situationship” was I able to remove myself from the dynamic. I met up with a friend from work who had just moved to a new firm for drinks. When she sat down at the bar she told me that she wasn’t doing well and had just gone through a breakup, and that she couldn’t talk to me about it. I immediately knew in my heart it was the same man I had been involved with.

I loved the attention because it made me feel good, and I never thought he’d be so arrogant and stupid as to get involved with multiple women in the same office at the same time. He risked his very successful career because he couldn’t control his urges. 

If this guy is as you describe him and you’re turning him down, he almost certainly moved on to another woman when you didn’t have sex with him. One year at our holiday party the uNPD in question propositioned me, when I turned him down he immediately moved from me to the other girl, and he sexually assaulted her in his apartment that night.

You need to get in touch with the fact that this is his MO, to make you feel special. It’s how he obtains what he wants from you. And if he wants it badly enough he will stop at nothing to get it, if he wasn’t getting attention from other women at your firm he would be breathing down your neck begging you for sex in a compulsive way. 

Having that experience made me realize that I was vulnerable to his behavior because it reminded me of my parents manipulation and my desire for their love. Think about what happened in your relationships with family members to make this behavior seem familiar and enticing. That will kill your “lady wood” fast! Good luck!"
raisedbyborderlines,feleles,t3_eg6ttv,1579220347.0,"My Dad is the same way. According to my therapist my mom is uBPD, and after reading Understanding the Borderline Mother I totally agree. My therapist hasn’t explicitly shared what she thinks about my Dad, but I wonder if he has BPD or NPD. He loves to hear the sound of his own voice, it’s compulsive.

For example, I happened to be in the same room as him last year when I was studying for a very important professional exam. I had all of my books and papers out, head stuck in my notes, and he still kept talking to me about whatever was on his mind. When I turned to him and explained what I was doing and the importance of it, he was able to stop himself for about 5 minutes. When he started talking again I reminded him of what we had just discussed minutes prior, and he got frustrated that he forgot and couldn’t control his speech. 

What the heck is this behavior?"
BPD,fekpbin,t1_fekhmit,1579204805.0,"You grow differently when you’re apart. I was in a similar situation with my ex when I was younger, I’m 30 and he’s 32 and we still love each other, although are not back together.

You learn things by being alone, and also by meeting and dating new people. It’s an important part of growing up. I thought about it like dating tourism, meeting new people, hearing their stories, and seeing how they treated me. I learned a lot and was able to incorporate healthier dynamics into my relationship/friendship with my ex. We may get back together and may not, who knows."
relationships,fec0dsl,t3_eodtgr,1578964828.0,I don’t know maybe tipping her off by asking her to meet somewhere might let her know something is up and she won’t be completely blindsided. She might not pick up on it but it wouldn’t be the worst thing if she had a feeling something was up.
therapy,fdt33ro,t3_en0p88,1578711290.0,"It sounds like it’s your borderline part forcing you back to being over-attached to your mum. 

At the core of Borderline Personality Disorder is an inability to leave “Mother”. This is usually your actual mother but can be any primary caretaker. Children who grow up in a healthy environment learn to slowly progress from being attached to their parents as infants (because they literally need their parents to survive, they almost identify with them completely and don’t perceive there is a difference between them and their parents, almost as if they are fused as one), to exploring the world as toddlers, and then eventually becoming independent individuals with their own decision making abilities.

A famous British psychoanalyst named Donald Winnicott said that a child needs only to grow up with a “good enough mother” or a “good enough environment”. What’s good enough to facilitate healthy growth is different for every individual, but it sounds like the therapist you saw perceived that you didn’t have a “good enough environment.” Somewhere along the way your process of “leaving Mother” was disturbed. 

The fact is, most parents fail their kids. In ways they couldn’t have anticipated, in ways they never meant to. In spite of that, you’re justified in having been hurt by the experiences you’ve gone through. Some kids get a “good enough home” and some don’t. Sometimes even within the same family. A difficult part of borderline personality is being able to hold onto both of those ideas at the same time - I am justified in being angry that I didn’t get all of the emotional support and stability I needed growing up but at the same time I recognize that my parents have been good to me and I love them. That’s called object constancy, seeing a person for the whole of who they are, rather than splitting them into good and bad parts. 

Maybe you’re experiencing some stress, and that’s why you are driven back to your mother. A part of BPD is the inability to soothe oneself, you occasionally fall back into being very attached to her looking for her to soothe you. 

Another core feature of BPD is fear of abandonment, maybe you feel your mother pulling away or yourself? And sometimes you get too far away and you get scared? 

Ultimately, you should accept who you are and learn more about your condition. Life is a bitch. Don’t be down on yourself or try to force yourself to reverse your behavior. Read and learn on your own, play an active role in your life and your own maturation process. Read Winnicott’s object relation and constancy theories, read Melanie Klein. BPD can go into remission, if you have the courage to look at what has gone wrong in your life, and with the help of a trusted professional finally separate from your Mum and learn to soothe yourself. Don’t rush it, it takes time. And remember to be kind to yourself always."

therapy,fdqy3j5,t1_fdpcurb,1578676544.0,"You’re only responsible for yourself. All we can do in life is take care of ourselves and treat the people around us with respect and kindness. 

You sound like a really sweet person who doesnt want to add to the hurt that’s already going on. However, by not telling your grandmother and shielding her from being worried, you’re actually being mean to yourself. You’re denying yourself the support you need. 

Would you ever do that to someone else? Advise them against talking to a family member or loved one when they feel sad and need support? Good people will always carry guilt when they treat someone badly, including themselves. You have to be good to everyone in your life, and that includes you. 

If you feel hurt, you should speak up."

relationships,fc6lwrt,t3_eghckl,1577483676.0,"Your father and step mother drove that rift between you and them. Don’t take responsibility for other people’s actions. You tried to do everything right but it appears you can’t do anything right. 

You should never be expected to subject yourself to abuse. No family is perfect but if the bickering drives you to tears and is one sided, that’s abusive. You have to save yourself, being exposed to that kind of behavior is damaging for you."
relationships,fc6gsc4,t3_egggji,1577480220.0,"You have to live your life for yourself, not for your parents. You’ll realize as you get older, a lot of the bad advice you get from your parents is actually a reflection of their own insecurities and mistakes. It is quite possible (likely even) that your Dad would make the same remarks to you if you were an engineering major. If you were an engineering major he might say you should drop out because you didn’t pursue medicine. Maybe he feels insecure about not receiving higher education? Maybe he’s intimidated by you and feels you might end up more successful. By the way, success comes in many forms. Maybe he resents the fact that you’re pursuing happiness and he never did. 

As far as your mom, being ignored like that is terrible and I’m really sorry she acts that way. I hope when you move to a new city you can create a new circle of friends 

Sometimes parents use their children as a source of energy, or a vessel to dump emotional baggage into. You are neither, you’re a human being who has a right to thrive. You are so strong, you’ve been through so much. I know you want to stop having to be so strong - that will come with surrounding yourself with good people. You CAN choose your family - you can choose your friends and you can choose your romantic partner. Make those choices wisely and cultivate your friendships, they will pay off in dividends down the road."

I haven’t perceived an issue between him and my family in the past, they have all gotten along really well. 

I do come from a better off family. I grew up in the New York area and my father worked as a stock broker when I was younger - he grew up very poor and worked hard to get out of his neighborhood. My boyfriend moved to New York to start a career in investment management and research. My boyfriend graduated from an Ivy League university and has an MBA, neither of which any of my family members have. We all went to decent state schools but no one has an academic pedigree."
ethtrader,erphj1g,t1_erpg83p,1561117637.0,"The fund is constantly offering new shares at NAV to private placement investors who purchase directly from grayscale. There is a 12 month lockup period, after which they are free to sell their shares on the secondary. This is a trust, not an ETF. You can see on the Grayscale website exactly how many coins are owned by the trust."
ethtrader,eromntw,t1_ernxely,1561083023.0,"It’s not like ETHE came to market at a 10x premium that was set by Grayscale. Accredited investors have been purchasing ETH via ETHE since December 2017, the vast majority of whom purchased at much higher prices than what we’re seeing in the spot market today. These owners who purchased at NAV (.0964 of an ETH) are free to offer their shares at whatever price they wish. I don’t believe any new shares of ETHE were created in the process of its being listed on OTC, so the only shares that can be purchased on the secondary are those being sold by existing owners. These private placement owners are demanding a price that would be appropriate if ETH were trading at $3,000. That’s roughly in line with many price targets for ETH during the next short term bull run. 

I do believe the premium will correct to something in the range of 1.3x - 5x. All we need is a little whiff of panic and people will start unloading their ETHE shares, letting the premium drain out. 

Check out the chart on ETCG. Traded at a massive premium in the first 10 days then plummeted."
EthereumClassic,epmpgo2,t3_buys5o,1559315934.0,"At the time of this post ETCG is trading at about 5.3x it’s NAV.

It feels like some impending news is affecting ETCG dramatically. Throughout BTCs run in 2017 and 2018, the highest premium I recall ever seeing in GBTC (Grayscale bitcoin trust) was 4.3x, and that was at the height of mania. 

The ETHE trust is set to trade in about a week. Could this have something to do with the premium expansion in ETCG? 

I’m inclined to believe there’s more going on behind the scenes and the smart money knows what’s up. But the smart money moving the market isn’t the whale crypto holders, it’s the owners of exchanges and VC guys involved in the crypto space. Coinbase and Grayscale are each owned by the same parent company I believe. If that’s the case they decided to release the ETHE fund to the secondary at a time when they believe it will be very advantageous to do so. 

Meanwhile GBTC is only trading at 1.4x premium. What are people sniffing out in the ethereum marketplace? What is Grayscale quietly telling their institutional clients? Thoughts?"
