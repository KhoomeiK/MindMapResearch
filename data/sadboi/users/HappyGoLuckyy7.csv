otomegames,fos1i37,t1_forxhp6,1588022267.0,"I came to see if someone mentioned this game, because it was first one I thought about after seeing the title. I agree with this, that game was such a mess... I mean, art is pretty, voices are brilliant... but the rest is just so bad. I went in without any real expectations and was still let down, lol. Mostly because it had potential to actually be good, because setting was interesting, but then it ended up being a mess plot-wise. Felt like my book-writing attempts, decent idea, but no ability to make it at all, so the result is a grand rushed mess of disjoined events that barely feel connected."
SIFallstars,fmcjj04,t1_fmbtlyk,1585946888.0,Thank you so much for great explanation and advice! I changed things around in my team and it already works better!
SIFallstars,fmbpkjs,t3_fsoj5x,1585930874.0,"Thanks to a kind soul here my team was nicely improved before the previous event, but since I tried to get new Umi UR (failed, but got few new cards, best girls Nico and Yohane included, so I'm still happy with it), I'm asking for advice yet again.    

My current cards are [here](https://imgur.com/a/9lxiqZT) (posting just the URs, because from what I gathered so far, it's always better to use URs in this game?). My current team has 2 Kotori cards and You as main 3, with the rest being other URs I had at that moment. I'm still kind of clueless about teambuilding, but I saw Maki and Eli on some tier lists, so I thought it might be a good idea to change some things. Please don't mind levels/upgrades, I'm slowly and steadly working on this and plan to change team gradually as I upgrade them.    

Also, side question, as a former SIF player... just how much do attributes matter in this game? Is it better to create teams for each attribute with SRs, or does it actually not matter that much and card skills/stats are more important, so it's better to have one team? Note that I'm just barely scratching advanced songs and didn't even S score all intermediate, so my question is mostly for those (since I heard something about a higher difficulty level that will come in the future)."

runefactory,fl2k853,t3_fm1wsl,1584752998.0,"I started playing with the same idea - no way I'm getting married without Venti. I kind of cheated and tamed Sharance Maze monsters to speed through Rune Prana 😁 it hurt so much to make 20 cookies for Valentine's Day instead of 21 because Venti wasn't there, so I got stubborn and got her back few days before White Day, lol. Who cares that I'm playing as Frey, COOKIES FOR EVERYONE :D in the end I didn't even start dating before getting Venti back, because I didn't want her to miss out on anything...  😂"

SIFallstars,fkxyxsb,t3_f6w3gp,1584638139.0,"New event just started, so I should finally probably start building actual team instead of just using whatever I like the most. Out of my cards, which ones would be the best to use? I probably need to upgrade them anyway, because I'm mostly playing casually, but it would help to know the direction.    

Here are my cards: [https://imgur.com/a/OmQLjHn](https://imgur.com/a/OmQLjHn)"
runefactory,fkad7op,t3_fhbpf5,1584002597.0,"Mine is definitely Kiel. I was neutral towards him at first (mostly just thought he looks too young to romance him), but he ended up becoming my favorite and now on Switch I'm going for him first again, lol. Now my love is getting stronger since I love his original voice 😂 since Switch version has a lot of saves, I plan to eventually romance everyone, but I'm not sure if I'll be strong enough, haha."
NintendoSwitch,fjp5mqm,t3_feehsy,1583542413.0,"Well damn, there goes my excuse to put off buying this game. I'm so glad Switch doesn't have region lock. Ordered."
2meirl4meirl,fji2dzy,t3_fdj9x3,1583359452.0,"Super guilty of this and will stay guilty of this because, I mean, I'm not worth it if I'm NOT ""low maintenance""."
depression,fjhr153,t3_fdfhlm,1583353480.0,"All the time. If I'm left by myself, it's either this or negative thoughts. I don't want to leave those daydreams, at times they feel more real than reality."
Trufemcels,fj61cxb,t3_fbn4t7,1583051899.0,"Story of my life, except I look way worse, lol."
ForeverAlone,fj4zs3l,t3_fbcz1n,1583020822.0,"I rarely even touch female hands (except for occasional ""Oh, your nails are so pretty, can I see them closer?"" with friends), let alone actually touching and holding guys hand. They seem like they'd be so nice to hold. It feels so silly, but sometimes I just fantasize about how it would feel."
otomegames,fhst4ap,t3_f4nk8h,1581865081.0,"Iris School of Wizardry. It's the most classic setting you can get - commoner MC in elite magic school, princes, knights etc. It's on the shorter side, but pretty decent. Graphics are cute and really... shoujo manga style. MC looks like a doormat, but is actually outspoken and talented. While it's definitely not comparable to Hakuoki, Nightshade etc, it's fun, especially if you want setting like this. Voice acting is also good. It's only on Switch though. I think right after it was released, translation was horrible, but it got fixed now. It was fine when I played it."
ForeverAlone,fhkbtdu,t1_fhjvgld,1581676798.0,"Lol, that's because I perfected my happy mask, so basically most people who know me irl think I'm this happy-go-lucky person without any problems. Doesn't help that memes and jokes are the only way in which I can actually talk about my problems. Currently I'm checking how many depressing memes I can send before someone asks if I'm ok. So far so good, people are blind to this unless told directly :D"
ForeverAlone,fhkbaes,t3_f3poa4,1581676043.0,"Yes. I'm the person people go to when they need to rant. Relationship issues are ones I really, REALLY can't relate to at all. I end up having some really nasty thoughts. But what's even worse for me are those ""I haven't seen my boyfriend in TWO WHOLE DAYS, I miss him soooo much"". One time acquaintance said that, I just wanted to slap her so much. She knows that I never dated anyone. Still has a nerve to say this and brag about how happy she is."
2meirl4meirl,fhj2gj1,t1_fhj1tvr,1581636841.0,"I can't say no to people because I'm scared of disappointing them :D I won't volunteer, because I'm scared of failing, but if I'm directly asked, I can't say no. I only volunteer to do something if I'm convinced that I screwed up somehow and I need to make up for it."
2meirl4meirl,fhiwm0w,t3_f3h667,1581633296.0,"I'm trying to find a single point that doesn't apply to me, but nope, all of them do. Damn."
ForeverAlone,fhiqls3,t1_fhipgkc,1581629895.0,"There's huge difference between enjoying happy stories, because they kind of hurt, but still somehow bring this tiny bit of hope or just make me both happy and jealous for other people (like my friend bragging about her boyfriend), and reading stuff like this, written by judgemental assholes. Normies like this treat us like some worse, difference species, but in the end, people like this are not worth trying to get along with anyway. It can be hard, but it's best to remember not everyone has this kind of mindset."
ForeverAlone,fhiole4,t1_fhio1yh,1581628793.0,"That might be for the best. Sometimes I read some posts for fun, but most of them are just impossible for me to relate to, since almost all people there are normies."
ForeverAlone,fhimv6j,t3_f3a0ux,1581627839.0,"WOW WHAT THE HELL. Most of those comments are super rude. Part of me wants to say ""Well, that's what you get for asking normies"", but then again I know some normies that wouldn't say stuff like this, simply because they're, I don't know, decent human beings? Some part of me didn't want to believe people can be this judgemental. I mean, I'm judgemental about myself being 25 this year and didn't even have my first kiss, but then again, I'm FA woman with no self esteem, so I'll find every reason to hate myself more :D tbh the only reaction the question made me have was something along the lines of ""Wow, dude, same! Wanna grab some coffee then?"" except I wouldn't actually add coffee part because there's no way I could be this presumptuous to think that just because someone is FA, they have no standards, so they'd grab a coffee with me, lol."
2meirl4meirl,fhfozjh,t3_f2rclb,1581547995.0,"Ouch. Even if it's just discussion in my own head, I still always switch to English."
depression,fhfosx9,t3_f2vazt,1581547877.0,"LOL, this gave me a good laugh :D Are you me? It's exactly how I feel, especially on some better days. And then it hits hard again."
ForeverAlone,fhflj5c,t3_f2um1p,1581545854.0,"I mean, technically it's true that women have it easier with dating. It just doesn't mean that some women don't struggle with problems often discussed here. I mean, the fact that women DO have it easier kind of makes me feel even more like a failure, since I am one and well... I'm here.

I won't go as far as to say I don't get any matches - there's not a lot, but still some. It's just, most of the time I write, I don't get reply. If I do, sometimes it stops after few ""introductory"" messages. Sometimes conversation is going well, but there's absolutely no reply next day. Far less common, but it happens that we talk for few days, it seems to be going ok, then suddenly it changes, conversation stops flowing, I seem to be the only one to write first, I get one word replies... I mean, it's kind of hard not to give up at this point if I want to have any dignity left. In case we eventually meet (which happened 2 times), I end up being ghosted after one time, because I'm better at texting than talking and I'm super awkward when I first meet people.

I am kind of passive - mostly because I don't feel confident enough to be active and I literally just have no damn idea how it's supposed to go. I try to respond with being active when the other person is as a middle ground, I try to compliment even if I'm scared of being creepy, I'm trying to prolong conversation, but what I often get is people ignoring me, being condescending, giving ""advice"" and lecturing, or just being straight up mean.

I'm not looking for a Chad - I just want someone nice who actually likes me, because it's the hardest thing to find. I don't really have any ambition and I'm not a 'climbing higher and higher"" type of person, play on console that's not really popular where I live, like books and don't really use social media. I'm boring and awkward. I'm not really pretty either. It's basically impossible for me to strike interest in most people.

Wow this reply got way too long.    

Edit: Adding TL;DR because I write too much - for TL;DR just read beginning, everything else is just my rant."

I've read some time ago that it won't, but it has in this video and now I'm super confused if I missed some information. Can I hype that I'll be able to set japanese voices?"
runefactory,fh531fw,t3_f1bmz3,1581284563.0,"Kiel, he guilt-tripped me into loving him, lol. I couldn't handle the sad scene I got after Frey started dating someone else on my first save file. Depending on how many save files there will be, eventually all of them, I hope."
otomegames,fgpmog5,t3_ezt44x,1581007886.0,"I'm sort of picky, I guess? If art has some glaring quality flaws, it really bothers me. Also, if it's the artstyle I don't like, it takes a lot of convincing. But really, all it takes for me is find some detail or one LI that catches my attention and I can mostly get over it. If nothing really sticks out to me and I don't like artstyle, then I just can't, it would take a loooot of recommendations for me to try a game, haha."
ForeverAlone,fggxm0a,t3_eyc250,1580771846.0,"Yeah, same. It's not even paying attention in my case, it's enough if a guy who's more or less around my age is just simply nice to me and I'm already starting to crush on him. I have enough grip on reality to know it's hopeless and give up right away, but I can't help it. Just someone being friendly and smiling makes me this way, it takes one small compliment or something similar for me to imagine our future life together, lol. ~~It sounds way creepier than when I said it in my head, hah.~~"
botw,fgg9hv6,t3_ey9e4d,1580757136.0,"For me it's also Kakariko village. It's beautiful, feels the most homey ~~also fairy fountain nerby.~~ I always seem to come back there if I need to cook, or even when I'm saving to close the game, lol. I can't seem to feel connected with any other town this way. My second favourite would be Zora's domain, it's just amazing. Plus Vah Ruta was my first divine beast to free and I can't get over how beautiful Zora's domain is in sunny weather. Basically, Kakariko village feels like home, Zora's domain is perfect to go sightseeing. Too bad we can't choose where we want to buy a house."
otomegames,ffkppuq,t1_ffin7lr,1580026736.0,"Yesss, I wanted Kuroko no Basket otome game ever since I was obsessed with it in high school. I mean, there's basically more than 30 hot guys with distinguished personality and design, only like, 2 girl characters, it was super popular with girls... why DIDN'T they make otome game? The same is true for Haikyuu. I'm still waiting for those games. Tenipuri ones were fun, even though I know nothing about Tenipuri, never watched it.   
Also Boku no Hero Academia. I want action otome game, lol. So many shounen manga/anime would make great otome games."

ForeverAlone,f9l8nux,t3_e5oz61,1575417068.0,"I mean... as a FA girl with literally no experience I'd actually prefer it, lol. It would save the whole ""shit I have no idea what is expected of me, should I just try to fake having experience or what"" issue. For girls, being a 21+ virgin is considered weird too, add to that ""Oh, I never dated anyone before"" and people just wonder what's wrong with me."
otomegames,f9jzt47,t1_f9jt3ab,1575389648.0,"Lol, Shin made me rage-quit Amnesia in one hour, I got so annoyed at him and wished I could talk back. I started Kent and decided this game is not that bad after all, but I'm super slow with PC games. I wish english version of Amnesia was on Switch, I'd buy it even though I have it on PC, because I just prefer to play in portable mode."
otomegames,f9jo8dj,t1_f9jnw2p,1575381324.0,"Exactly, lol! When it comes to crazy stuff, the crazier, the better for me, because it's fun and thrilling to read and it's fiction, so no harm for me. Insults though? I want to punch LIs lights out, haha. Especially bad when MC doesn't talk back. Also the reason why I'm bad with tsundere and rarely like them."
otomegames,f9jnb4e,t3_e57pob,1575380528.0,"Kuroyuki is my favourite character, lol. I played his route first, because I loved him from the first time he appeared, and it ended up being my favourite route in general. The whole >!yandere-ish!< thing aside, he's the sweetest thing ever and I was awwwwing at most of his scenes and my heart was melting like chocolate on a hot day, haha. Sweet, but mischievous enough to tease the MC is probably my favourite character trait combo. Plus there is his whole >!tragic backstory!< that just makes me want to hug him. I liked every route in the end, but Kuroyuki is definitely my fav."
otomegames,f9jmbhj,t3_e5go9y,1575379656.0,"LI: is a total psycho, there is cage-locking, manipulation, torture, murder of MC or other characters    

Me: enjoying the thrill    

LI: Calls MC an idiot    

Me: HOW DARE YOU?!    

...My standards are weird."
otomegames,f8xs562,t3_e2h1jq,1574931444.0,"If it's available, I'd rather get physical version. Exception being that the game is on huge sale on eshop and I happen to see it (curse you, black Friday sales). I definitely want to order physical version of all otome games that will be released on switch next year, if they have one."
ForeverAlone,f8wq701,t1_f8vnion,1574896971.0,"Yeah, I agree with pretty much everything that you wrote. Sometimes I just want to tell people ""Oh, you mean to tell me that you didn't have time to write short answer for past few days, do you take me for an idiot?"". I can understand not having time to read my messages if I just went into my spam mode and typed a whole article about this thing I just thought about and wanted to share, but taking few days to write back and writing about something totally unrelated just kills me inside, because why do I even bother? These days people do it all the time.   
And yeah, if I had a boyfriend, I'd definitely be super insecure about it. Like, he could be getting to know someone better right now, and will leave me and it's going to be the right decision because I'm a mess. I have no sense of self-worth, I can't even understand why my friends like me, let alone how someone could possibly love me. Most people would get annoyed at someone who needs constant reassurance. Plus it feels like these days so many people are so ambitious and focused on achieving so much, while I just kind of wish I could stop feeling miserable, depressed and lonely, because I just have no ambition or motivation whatsoever. It's so hard for me to get along with others because of that, because they won't understand it."
otomegames,f8wnut4,t3_e2ijfc,1574895238.0,"1. I read reviews for fun, lol. I've read ones even for games I'll never play, like ones only in japanese or only for vita. I always check several reviews before buying expensive games (and gameplay videos if it's not visual novel), one or two before buying cheaper ones. The only time I buy a game without doing my research, is seeing it on huge sale that makes me go ""Eeeh, for this price it's worth it either way"". But if I have something on my wishlist, I've probably already read a review, so it's mostly for some Switch indie titles, not otome. Sometimes it's fun to read a review for games I've already played too, to compare experiences.
2. Mostly some simple plot description (and comment whether or not plot actually makes sense in game), MC/LI descriptions to see if they seem interesting to me (and if character I like the most has a route/if any of the routes are locked), samples of CGs, how is writing/translation of the game, LENGHT (I really appreciate if it's mentioned). Sometimes I read some spoilers too, it's a pain to avoid them and it never really made me enjoy something less.
3. Not that much. I might get hyped for some route because review praised it and get disappointed, or be suprised that I like some route a lot more, while review said it was bad. But mostly I try to keep my expectations low anyway.
4. Most of the time yeah. It happens that review says that a game is mediocre, but I end up really liking it, or that it has questionable content, while I don't really mind it, but that's mostly me not having any triggers or content that will make me drop the game, it can go as crazy as possible and I'll be fine."
ForeverAlone,f8vmtke,t1_f8v24sc,1574872975.0,"I really, REALLY don't get those games. With the exception of when I'm at work, I'm the type to respond immediately and every time my friends take hours or DAYS to answer I just feel like I'm dying inside. Especially if it's ones who only respond fast when they need something... I consider my month social if I meet up with someone once, and it's always for a reason, like there is a movie at cinema we both want to watch. It blows my mind that people meet up more often and just to hang out, or just decide to go to eat or drink, or come over to each other's houses. And yeah, sure, my friends do that too, with their boyfriends. I come home and play games or read, hoping someone will at least text me and check if I'm still alive. I force myself to find something to do, because if I keep busy, I don't think about being lonely as much. I swear every time I hear jokes about me being antisocial, I want to scream that it's not my own choice. Yeah, I guess I am bitter and jealous. Loneliness does that to people. I want to love someone, constantly send messeges about silly stuff and meet up often. Ideally it would be another FA, lol. I mean, less pressure when the other person also has no experience. The problem is finding that person, because I don't meet new people because I have no social life and tinder makes me want to kill myself.    
About killing inbox and responding, tbh, the only reason for not responding for me would be that probability of living in the same country, or even continent, is really small, since I'm not from US (plus, sorry to disappoint, my inbox was never killed after posting here, lol). Note, it's only for the ""hey, we're both lonely and desperate, we can date"" type of messages, I mean... what's the point when it's impossible to meet? I'd never be against just chatting about stuff, I'm desperately lonely and need human contact, lol. I'm here after all."
otomegames,f8uxthh,t3_e2dr81,1574850167.0,"For me it depends. I only have PC, 3DS and Switch, so no Vita vs Switch problem for me, I'm just getting them all on Switch once they're released (and hope some PC/Vita ones get Switch port too in the future). I got Hakuoki and Amnesia on PC when they were on huge sale, but since then I bought Switch and I definitely prefer to play on it, so if they'll ever come to Switch (not probable, but not ruling it out since japanese ones are on Switch), I will definitely get them on Switch too. Games like Rune Factory 4 Special on Switch, not sure, I have RF4 on 3DS (from eshop) and played it A LOT, plus Switch one doesn't really have anything new... but if I see physical edition on sale, I'll probably get it too, lol. I never cared for physical editions on PC, but 3DS and Switch I just can't resist, haha."
ForeverAlone,f8s2tzc,t3_e1pbs5,1574766467.0,"I'm a supporting character, lol. The one that just shows up when needed to cheer on the protagonist and then blends with background again. In fiction those characters rarely get their character arc, I usually love those, but I'm not getting one."
ForeverAlone,f8s2ech,t3_e1twpo,1574765799.0,"Being too trusting towards friends did it way before I started to consider myself FA. I have huge trust issues, I hate myself and can't bring myself to open up to people. Because I'm scared to trust people, my feelings towards them are so shallow, sure, I enjoy their company, but I wouldn't really care if they're out of my life by tomorrow, which makes maintaining friendships such a problem that I don't even want to think how hard it would be to make a romantic relationship work. I back off any time I feel like I'm a bother. If I were to have a boyfriend, I'd probably be either overly clingy or seem uncaring and distant, not to mention not being able to believe that someone would actually want to date me."
depression,f8m0hp2,t3_e129a8,1574627050.0,"Anxiety is what makes me kind of high-functioning. Because I was scared of disappointing people, I found a job and this year also resumed studying, even though I really couldn't care less about it, but my family cares. Because of my anxiety, I can't bring myself to let people down, in fact I'm terrified of it, so every day I force myself to get up. It's actually kind of relaxing in a way - I'm forced to go out and I'm busy enough that I don't notice my lack of social life, I just move every day like a machine with happy mask on and don't have time to think about anything. My own emotions feel so numb at this point that I barely feel anything. I'm not even sure if there is any real me. I still only do bare minimum that I have to, go to work and classes, look neat but plain to stay invisible to others, and mostly sleep when there's nothing I HAVE to do. But in front of people my mask is perfect and nobody notices there's anything wrong with me, because ""how could I possibly let anyone know, it would cause them problems"". I trapped myself into this way of thinking and there's no way out, but I'm kind of fine with it. I'd rather be this numb machine with happy mask on my face than spiral down into my depression. I'd rather just feel nothing, it's easier than facing how much of a mess I am."
ForeverAlone,f7sm90w,t3_dxh030,1573996187.0,"I'm not even sure if I'd call it ignoring, I'm just the type that guys don't even really notice. I'd rather sleep for half an hour longer than wear make-up and my clothes are pretty plain. I'm not exactly ugly, but being chubby baby-face, nobody would ever call me pretty - the most I could probably get is ""kind of cute"" if I'd try, lol. Plus when I'm not at work, my personality is set to social anxiety mode when I don't know someone well enough. People are always suprised when they realize my personality is basically the opposite of how I act at first.    

I'm just... kind of this type that makes good side-kick for another girl, but is basically invisible to guys, because while no one goes out of their way to tell me I'm ugly, no one really finds me attractive, and my personality can't make up for it."
ForeverAlone,f7lxpn8,t3_dwtjak,1573850020.0,"Being the female cashier, yeah, that's usually the case. Being also FA, the rare kind happens to me way more often than I care to admit. I mean, I'm nice to everyone... it's literally part of my job. But I also find way too many guys around my age attractive, and if any of them smiles back or actually answers my ""cash register small talk"" besides usual yes/no, my brain is kind of melting and I need to tell myself to chill, because ""he's just being a normal, nice person"". I at least managed to get enough resistance to it so that I usually won't freeze and stutter when it happens, lol."
otomegames,f6xfsok,t3_dth5kg,1573248700.0,"For me it depends on the game. If a game has an actual story (not just slice-of-life scenes linked together with some drama at the end) I can handle having just few story/affection choices. It works better if MC has a personality, even better if I like her personality (so basically, if she's not totally passive and lets things just happen to her). Intended-self-insert MCs work better for me with choices that appear often. Choices in Love 365 are actually fine in my opinion, I enjoy being able to pick what I want and still get good ending. Same with Tailor Tales. For Amnesia... to be honest, I'd like even more choices there. I'm playing Kent now and it feels fine, but I rage-quit Shin after 1 hour because I got frustrated that I can't talk back, lol. Not exactly otome, but I enjoy choices in Red Embrace: Hollywood a lot, so many choices that just affect MCs supposed personality and that game lets me snark at people/play as a mean person just for my own entertainment. Same with (another not otome) Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor, for me that game is silent MC done right. In vn parts MC just talks through choices, but there are a lot of them and they actually allow the player to pick smart choices that make MC be the one to figure stuff out, instead of being fed an explanation by other characters. Plus being able to snark again.    

All in all, while replaying can be a pain with lots of choices that slow down skipping, I prefer having more, rather than less choices. Feels more interactive even if most of them don't affect anything."
otomegames,f6nywtl,t1_f695ger,1573003540.0,"Thought I'd give an update since I'm done with Goemon and Gekkamaru.    

Goemon was basically... everything I expected it to be and a little bit more, lol. I don't dislike flirt type, but it's far from my favourite... but he was so charming that I enjoyed it a lot anyway. It had some little twists too that suprised me, so I liked his route. This game somehow manages to suprise me with every route.    

And now Gekkamaru... my heart was NOT ready for it lmao. I knew some spoilers because I keep clicking  on spoilers like an idiot, I knew it was going to be dramatic and angsty... and damn, it still hit me hard. It took me longer to read it because I kept stopping at certain scenes. And I mean... overprotective childhood friend is usually my least favourite character. I generally dislike the childhood friend character in most games. I was neutral at most to Gekkamaru. But this was such a great emotional rollercoaster that I ended up loving it. Kuroyuki is still my no. 1, Hanzo is no. 2 as favourite character, but route-wise Gekkamaru is now tied with Hanzo purely because of powerful emotional impact it had on me.    

Now time for Chojiro... more angst, yay... I'm kind of neutral to his character too, but since this game is so good, I think I'll enjoy it anyway lmao."

While I'm never going to say that someone's problems are less horrible than mine, sometimes when my friends complain, I just want to say ""Oh nooo, you had a fight with your boyfriend? Poor you, you have a boyfriend and you had a little argument, and you're going to his place tomorrow and you'll cuddle for hours anyway"". I'm so petty. I start to resent every couple.   
Here I can at least relate to people. But that's why seeing comments how girls have it so easy feels even worse. Because it's really not like that for me."
depression,f6hrmf0,t3_drao00,1572863468.0,"Yes, definitely. I just can't force myself to say anything to anyone because I'm scared that they either won't care or be overwhelmed by it. If I tell even a little bit, I feel horrible afterwards. The only thing I can manage is joking about all the bad stuff, but people love being oblivious and nobody ever asked if something's wrong. I don't blame them, why should they deal with my problems? That's why I'm jealous every time I see someone talk about their problems, or when someone talks about their problems with me. I just want to ask them ""How are you even doing that without feeling crushing guilt that you're bothering the other person?"". I just can't do that."

I didn't manage to form a bond with someone in the past 5 years.    

That makes all the ""girls have it way easier/there are way fewer FA girls"" posts even more irksome, because 1. My experience, or lack of thereof, tells me differently, and 2. Looking at my friends/ex-classmates/coworkers, it's probably true and it just makes me even more of a loser, lol."

And after the ""big dark secret reveal"" I just really, REALLY wanted to hug him and tell him it's going to be fine now, lol. My poor baby. I'm so weak against this type, seriously, haha. But then again, I generally enjoy way darker psychological stuff, so for me it was just mostly fluff here, since he was so sweet and adorable like a little kitty."
otomegames,f692qjz,t3_dqq3vp,1572734459.0,"I got this game right after buying Switch not too long ago, so I'm still not done with it. I already did Kuroyuki and Hanzo routes, I started Goemon this morning.    

My first route, while playing totally blind, was Kuroyuki. While I loved Hanzo so much, I feel like Kuroyuki is going to stay as my favourite character and route. I agree with all the flaws that people point out about this route, but I can't help it - cute, cheerful and mischievous character hiding a dark secret/tragic past/mental issues etc. is basically my favourite character trope, lol. Plus Shimono Hiro's sweet-talking makes my heart melt like ice cream on summer day. From the first time he appeared I knew he was going to end up as my favourite.    

For now Hanzo is my 2nd favourite route and I doubt it'll change. I loved every second of it, how their relationship developed and I loved Enju in this route. Hanzo is an awesome character and Tsuda Kenjirou's voice is perfection (and I loved him as Kazama in Hakuoki as well)."

Generally I think it would be fun to play a game with a nutjob MC. The thing is, it doesn't have to be realistic, I want it to go over-the-top crazy, because it makes it fun."
otomegames,f60snim,t3_dq08jp,1572625086.0,"Sports manga/anime like Kuroko no Basket and Haikyuu. Not sports anime, but Durarara too. It may be just me, since I love those series to death, but there are so, SO many great and cute/hot guys. I mean, there are otome games for Prince of Tennis. I can totally see it working. ...Actually, I'd turn so many shounen mangas into otome games, they have better male characters than most shoujo, lol.   
Also, I'd love girl's side to Maji de Watashi ni Koishinasai vns. I know it's eroge and main focus are the girls, but some guys are just ridiculously hot and have great voice actors. Even protagonist is a cutie when he's actually drawn properly in cg's, and anime adaptation, while being generally poor quality, has him being voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi, who's my favourite voice actor. Including characters from sequels, I can think of at least 10 possibilities for routes (while some characters are mainly used for comedy scenes, I'd love to have actual serious story for them). The setting would also allow us to have ass-kicking MC, as so many girls are great fighters in this series. Also I feel like action comedy as main genre is used way to little, the main games are fun and hilarious, I think it would be nice to have an otome game like this too. It would definitely be unusual compared to other otome games though.   
Turns out I really want shounen manga-like otome game :D"

While Nightshade and some games that are coming in 2020 to Switch are well known and I've heard a lot about how good they are, there are some that I never really saw mentioned and got curious if they're any good or maybe I should stay away from them."
ForeverAlone,f5cmz5f,t3_dnll9i,1572137574.0,"Not really. I mean, my friends know me for 6-12 years, so they already know what's happening (or rather, not happening) in my non-existent social life. At work I'm pretty open about joking that I have no life and have way too much free time to kill, all alone. The only thing it lead to was one coworker joking, that if I have so much free time, I can come and work his shift, then I'd say no way, if I have to kill time, I'd rather play games. They don't really care and I'm glad about that. I even got close enough with one girl from work, that we sometimes share and complain about our lives a little and she didn't jugde when I went on a little pity party about never having a boyfriend. It's this one situation when the fact that people don't really care about others all that much is a good thing. Other than that, I didn't really get to know anyone well enough in past 5 years for them to ask.    

If I had to say it to a guy I actually would want to date, I'd be probably really embarrassed though. I wouldn't want to lie, because it would be obvious anyway, but it's still embarrassing. No such person in sights though, so problem solved?"

Now the problem with that is meeting this person and getting to this point as someone who didn't even manage to make new friend in the past 6 years because I'm so socially awkward around people that I don't already know well and just straight up scared to ask someone to meet up, because what if I'm a bother to them?"

While I get some matches, 90% doesn't even write back (...why would you swipe if you're not even going to write back?), sometimes I feel like conversation is going well, but the other person just stops writing and if we actually meet up, the fact that I'm weird, boring and have social anxiety takes care of the rest. I'm not even shy, it's just that my brain freezes when I'm talking to someone I don't know well and I have no idea what to say. Having no self-esteem and being scared of bothering someone certainly doesn't help. I hate myself and I can't help it.    

Normal women might have it easier. I know women who met their boyfriends through tinder. Let's be clear about one thing, FA is FA, no matter if they're man or woman. I have no idea how getting to know someone or having a relationship works, I'm terrified that my lack of any experience is obvious and I feel like I'm a lost cause. I'm just here to vent, like most people, since there is a limit to how much I can whine to my friends before it gets too pathetic. It also feels like the only place where I possibly won't be judged for being so hopeless. Sure, it changes absolutely nothing, but it's a nice change to be able to relate to someone after hearing my friends talk about their boyfriends."

It felt like my brain exploded, because random compliments from people never happen to me, and I was smiling like crazy and on cloud nine for days after it. I never saw that guy again, but it MADE MY MONTH.

Happened to me 3 times with my so-called best friends at the time, because I was too stupid, trusting and believed that people mean what they say. That's the sole reason for my huge trust issues, because I mean, trusting someone is basically giving them a knife to stab you with. People are not going to hestitate to throw me away when I become an inconvenience, no matter how close we are.

depression,f3985oe,t3_dg15z0,1570744838.0,"For strangers on the internet, they're strangers, they don't actually care. It makes it easier to share and vent while staying anonymous, but I never expect them to keep talking to me. For friends or family, I feel like it's just mostly social obligation and they say it while expecting it to be some small problem that you'll talk about for 5 minutes and then feel better. People don't want to notice that something bad is happening to someone around them, they'd rather keep fooling themselves that everything is fine and ignore any signal that's not glaringly obvious. I don't really mean it as a bad thing, it's natural. No one wants to find out that their friend or family member is actually depressed. They'd rather stay oblivious. At least that's my observation. Most people just do it for their own satisfaction, because they feel like they should, or maybe they really want to help, but it's not because they are actually prepared for it.    

By no means am I saying that there are no such people that genuinely reach out to others and want them to share. Some people will actually keep writing back. Some people notice warning signs. Some friends will actually keep asking and listening. I'm kind of jealous of people who are able to share their problems with others. The times when I actually tried to share a little, we talked a bit and then the topic is never brought up again, as if situation was magically cured, because people would rather pretend that nothing is happening. I don't bring it up myself because I'm scared of being a burden and it ends there."

It exhausted me to the point where I was praying for one day without having to listen to their problems and felt so awful for this. I also got so used to always being alert and glued to my phone in case of crisis situation (which happened at least once a day), that when they got better, I just felt useless, like my life has no meaning anymore. It's also one of the main reasons why I'm keeping all my feelings inside and not forming any new relationships now (my trust issues aside).

I work at the bookstore and people usually are really nice, but one crazy customer just looking for a person to shout at can really ruin your whole day. People can start an argument over the weirdest things. I had people getting angry that we don't have a book that was last released more than 10 years ago and can only be found at auctions by now, or that their discount card doesn't work, when it's been 1,5 years since the change in policy about them, which caused most of them to become inactive, but it's a matter of 1 minute to get new one. But remember, it's almost never actually your fault, it's them who can't behave in public and it's their problem. For me it helps to think that it's also almost never personal, if different person was in your spot, the crazy person would act the same. There's not much you can do except staying calm. It's also great to hear you have nice colleagues! It's ok to rely on other people in such situations. It takes time to learn how to deal with them. Also, to find some positive thing, next time you'll know a bit better how to deal with it, for example you won't be suprised if someone asks about those programs.

My very few ""friends"" are more like glorified acquaintances, it's a miracle if we meet up every few months. I consider one person my friend and I'm never going to tell her how messed up I am, because I don't want it to burden her. It's mostly me who's trying to meet up with people, but they actually have social life and don't have too much free time, like me, so I'm stopping myself, so that I won't annoy them by being too clingy. But at this point I'm just craving any sort of connection and just feel like I'm all alone, while listening to others talking about things they've done with friends or partners, while I'm sitting at home by myself. Nobody really knows about this, because I'm always wearing my cheerful mask, acting like I don't have a single worry and always joking around. I never show how I actually feel. But then again, without it I probably wouldn't even be able to work normally like I do now.    

It would just be so nice to have this one person I can connect to and feel loved.
