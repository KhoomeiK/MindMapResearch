He'll kiss me after going down on me, but not the other way around, but that said, he's been getting a lot better at the idea! The last time I went down on him he kissed me with no prompting, and seems okay with it if it's before he's cum in my mouth lol

Anxiety,fp87mmd,t3_gbnjuv,1588385562.0,"My feelings exactly... My work was very stressful and anxiety inducing before all this started, and it was nice to get a break, but now I'm legitimately terrified of going back. The idea of having to deal with the abuse and shit I get from my boss is making me so depressed, anxious, and I fell into some harmful old habits because of it. It's even worse because I can't go to the doctor's for help, and there's been no news of whether easing of lockdown will mean they'll be available again. I hope the rumours of lockdown easing aren't true... But I also hope lockdown ends for everyone else's sake... It's such a mixed feeling."
sex,fp872sc,t1_fp7j0l5,1588385178.0,"You won't feel it in the way you'd feel with your fingers, it's more like a vague sensation, it's more intense once it's inside obviously but won't feel any more unusual than when you put a tampon or toy in there, although it'll feel warmer than those things obviously. It's honestly not as scary or crazy as everyone hypes it up to be, if you have a good partner and your both thorough and careful, it'll be a great experience. Even if you have a little pain and discomfort, it can still be pleasurable. I didn't orgasm my first time but my partner made sure to pleasure me after, and that dulled the pain. 

I still get pain sometimes, if it's been a while since we did it, but once it's in and you're in the mood, the pain doesn't match the pleasure NGL

I really hope you have a good first time though, and make sure he goes slow when doing the whole penetration for the first time. Best thing to do is ease into it as slowly as possible once you're prepped and ready. Don't rush it, the slower he moves the more time your giving yourself to adjust.

DWPhelp,fp61sj8,t3_g7rjkj,1588344446.0,"I highly recommend appealing, my partner has been fighting PiP for 2 years, and I've known multiple people who have applied before. I know one woman who has intermittent random seizures! And they still awarded her 6 points at her first assessment, simply because she didn't have a seizure in the 20 minutes she was there. 

I've heard multiple situations like this. I feel they get told to automatically give anyone a low score, as all the people I know who appeal after get a much higher score, and a more accurate assessment of their abilities. I've seen them lie on first time assessments multiple times. Even little things, saying my partner ""picked up his bag and put it over his shoulder with his right arm effortlessly."" When he's left handed, and was having pains during the entire interview."
AmItheAsshole,fp60o7v,t3_gbf3r9,1588343825.0,"NTA she's very much the asshole in this situation. What does she mean? What are you supposed to ""learn"" from that? To not have sex? She's clearly just shaming you for having sex, which is nothing to be ashamed of. 

You're with a partner, you use protection, its not like you were sleeping with multiple people and didn't use protection (and even then she's still got no right to shame you). 

Even if these are her opinions, to shame you like that, while you're going through one of the worst things someone can go through? Shittiest friend imaginable. I had a pregnancy scare a few weeks back, and was sick with the feeling of having to make that decision. I so use protection, with my partner, and am just not ready for a pregnancy or child. I'm so sorry you had to go through that, and that your friend acted this way. You'll be better off without her."
sex,fp4kddp,t3_gb869a,1588300963.0,"It's kinda immature to think others shouldnt say that certain ages aren't emotionally mature for sex. Most (if not all) 12 year olds are not emotionally, mentally, or physically prepared for sex at that point, whether you believe you were or not, that's just how it is. Getting angry at people for saying this is pointless, because you'll never convince anyone that any twelve year old could possibly be able to consent.

Personally I don't think we should try normalizing anyone 16 and under having sex, whether it's with someone of the same age or not, just for their own safety. Being sexual is fine, exploring your sexuality is fine, so long as you're safe and not being preyed upon. But nobody under 16 will convince any adult that they're mature enough for sex, and if any adult is convinced, they're probably not someone to be trusted.

You're still young, so you might change your mind as you mature more, I definitely thought I was ready for things I wasn't at your age."
sex,fp4jb25,t3_gb92xq,1588300293.0,"I would definitely talk to your doctor about hallucinating and passing out during sex tbh, that kinda sounds worrying? I've never heard of it! I've also cried during, due to joy and love and overwhelming emotions, but never passed out or hallucinated and that honestly sounds so worrying xD 

Flirting I get, I used to like flirting, not so much anymore. So long as you aren't going beyond what you think your partner would be comfortable with I think it's fine. Just wouldn't lead anyone on if you could help it, or try resisting that all together."
sex,fp4iwpy,t3_gb9d2s,1588300046.0,"I can relate to this situation so much but in the other direction? Personally I'm very self conscious a d have no confidence in myself being sexy, or in verbally being open about sex and flirting. My partner however, he loves flirting and teasing, and all that jazz. A while back he also asked me if I didn't find him sexy anymore because I was so closed off about sex in general. 

I'm honestly not sure the best course of action, he probably just needs to gain confidence in verbalising feelings and flirting. But obviously it won't happen if he doesn't want to :( maybe try talking to him again, tell him how much it bothers you, maybe try giving him more attention so he can see how it feels? Or maybe even try more experimental foreplay.

I've found a fun way to mess around is using our remote control vibe. I dress up as sexy as I can, give him the remote, and we wait and see how long either of us can hold out. All the while going through our daily routines. Maybe just doing something more experimental could help him learn to communicate? But honestly that sounds tough, and I hope you figure it out!"
sex,fp4fdw3,t1_fp4dwow,1588297860.0,"Yeee, like I'll just tell him I'm not feeling that today, he'll still fondle and motorboat the boobs but will avoid the nips. It doesn't help that I had surgery on one of my breasts last year, and since then I'll get random tenderness in that one, makes it painful to move let alone let him fondle it lol"
sex,fp4exqa,t3_gb8iy8,1588297590.0,"Honestly I don't know, obviously you should be attracted to your partner physically, and if you're not attracted to how he looks now that's valid. You gotta ask yourself, if you hadn't met him till this point, would you have still dated him? If not then there's the answer.

Maybe talk to him and ask him if it bothers him, if he's still confident in how he looks it's not fair to ask him to change just to please you. 

You gotta ask yourself what matters more, him as a person you love, or his physical appearance. 

My partner also gained a little weight over the past year, mostly down to being unable to exercise, depression, and our unhealthy eating habits. I love how he looks regardless, but I still suggested we work out together, and try eating healthier meals. The fact I proposed it as something we should both do, and would support eachother through is something he appreciated. Making a change like that is scary, and you don't want to fail, so having someone there to work with and support you when you fall is what everyone needs.

Although you ALSO have to accept everyone's body's change, people's metabolisms change and get worse with age, mental health can take a toll, and if you truly love someone their body is probably the least of your worries. Personally I would never want to change my partners body unless it was detrimental to their health, and they feel the same about me. If you gained weight or went through any other body changes, do you think your SO would be bothered? Would they ask you to change? Honestly those are the things you have to consider, treat them how you would want/expect to be treated if you were in their position."
sex,fp4di1y,t3_gb8uok,1588296727.0,"Personally I don't mind it, my partner loooves it, but for me it's a take it or leave it.

sex,fp4cuxg,t1_fp1uv9o,1588296343.0,"Yeah, I wouldn't recommend doing that, personally I think it would be better to do tons of foreplay, then lots of communication as you start. Honestly I don't think it's very painful, I'd put my pain on a 4 on the 1 to 10 scale and my partner was fairly big (around 6 inches and fairly thick imo) and I was pretty prepared. I feel like if I'd prepared more, relaxed, or communicated more, it would have been a 2 or less. Everyone's different honestly, but I wouldn't worry if I were you, the pain won't be any worse than pain you've had before (cramps ect.) I was terrified of my first time and had the same fears about the pain (and also asked around on Reddit xD), and it truly does come down to being prepped, being relaxed, and communication. 

The only issue I had with my first few times was getting off during penetration, but that also got better with communication and practice! Having a few drink beforehand also helped me relax a LOOOT."
sex,fp0nrgh,t3_gamzi9,1588213022.0,"You'll feel it pretty instantly, like you feel fingers if those enter you, but obviously it's a different feeling. It'll only hurt a lot if you're not prepared, i.e. wet and relaxed. The more you relax and the more wet you are the easier it goes. Mine wasn't suuuuper painful but it definitely could have been better, and I regret not communicating that with my partner. Best thing to do is let him eat you out, get really into it, and relax. It sounds silly but it really is only worse if you're super tense, so try and communicate as much as you can, I was terrified before I had my first at 21 but the more you do it, the more you get wet before hand, the better it is! And as they say, practice makes perfect xD"
AmItheAsshole,fokgg2y,t1_fokbi8a,1587841606.0,"I've messaged them, and basically said if they want to talk they can, but that if nothing is going to change I'd rather not pretend everything's okay. I'm not sure how the right was to handle it is. In my opinion a friendship is talking, caring, doing stuff together, and listening when someone has an issue. So far they've ignored me, called me paranoid, admitted they're also at fault, then made no mention of making an effort to change anything. I just feel so drained with giving them everything I can, and I've ran out of patience.

I'm not mad they aren't chasing me, I'm mad that they refuse to acknowledge their part in the situation. I'd be fine if they just admitted they didn't put in as much effort as they could, or if they simply said they didn't want to talk to me or do anything with me. The part that upsets me is being ignored for months, being the last option, and then when I voice my feelings I'm told I'm ""paranoid"" and that it's really me that's at fault. I need my own space too, but being ignored for weeks at a time, all the while I can literally see them online doing things with other people, I feel that's different."

 I'd suggest giving him more direction on where/what feels good. Or if nothing feels good then oral might just be something you're not into, and I'm sure it'd be disappointing for him, but I think he'd rather you fully enjoy what you're doing than doing something you don't like."
