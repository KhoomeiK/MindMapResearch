benzodiazepines,fnt6x7i,t1_fnt6txj,1587235786.0,Haha you can if you‚Äôre not careful! I think it‚Äôs better for withdrawing off pain pills or heroin than benzos. I would personally stick to cannabis.
benzodiazepines,fnt668v,t1_fnt5sle,1587235371.0,It‚Äôs extremely addictive and effectively an opioid. It works like hydros on your opioid receptors. It is illegal in many countries but gets away with being a ‚Äúdietary supplement‚Äù here. If you get addicted to Kratom the withdrawals are similar to that of prescription painkillers or heroin
benzodiazepines,fnt5jnv,t1_fnt5cmy,1587235025.0,This taper I made  is with the 14 pills you have left. I would not try kratom or if you do you need to be super careful and just use it for withdrawals because it is extremely addictive. In my opinion Kratom should be an illegal substance and cannabis should be legal everywhere.
benzodiazepines,fnt4576,t1_fnt0c1i,1587234258.0,"You said you used 6 so you have 14 left. You should try for a 2 week taper. I‚Äôd say:

Day 1: 2 bars (different times, 6-8 hours in between) 

Day 2: 2 bars (different times, 6-8 hours in between) 

Day 3: 1.5 bars (I would break them all into halves and take 1/2 in the morning 1/2 in the middle of the day, and 1/2 at night) 

Day 4 repeat day 3 

Day 5: repeat day 4 

Day 6: 1 bar (break in half, morning and night doses) 

Day 7: repeat day 6 

Day 8: repeat day 7 

Day 9: 1/2 bar broken in two halves (morning and night take 1/4 bar respectively) 

Day 10: repeat day 9 

Day 11: repeat day 10 

Day 12: repeat day 11

Day 13: take 1/4 bar

Day 14: take 1/4 bar

Then you‚Äôre done assuming my math is right lol. Use cannabis for excessive anxiety or other withdrawal symptoms. I‚Äôm no doctor, I‚Äôve just tapered off before. It‚Äôs gonna be hard but doing it slowly makes it possible and easier than cold turkey."
benzodiazepines,fnt006w,t1_fnsyooe,1587232018.0,"I would not recommend going cold turkey. These are intense medications that can cause seizures if you simply stop taking them. I recommend slowly taking less and less until you‚Äôre down to zero. This will minimize the chance that you‚Äôll have a seizure and will help significantly with withdrawals. If you‚Äôre in a legal state/country or have a source, cannabis is also very helpful for withdrawals."

I maxed out the dose at 300mg it helps me so much with my anxiety and depression, more than anything else has. Since after a few years of 300mg I started having more breakthrough anxiety and depression. Since I maxed out the dose, my doc added Wellbutrin to the Effexor. I find it an amazing combination! I feel energetic, calm, talkative, etc. I feel like my old self again like when I was a kid. I feel free from the demons of depression and I feel like my tumor of anxiety has been removed.

depressionregimens,fnorquq,t1_fneg9im,1587132285.0,"This is extremely invalidating to individuals who struggle with mental illness, as well as people who take these medications for anxiety or for symptoms related to PTSD/ trauma. 


My experience is that people are very confused about the physical reality of my illness. The mind is not actually separate from the body in the current reality that we occupy (I don't really know about the next one, if there is a next one). Just like you can't think yourself over a bad cold, you can't think yourself out of a mental illness because it's rooted in the chemistry of your brain and nervous system.

Neurotypical people who tell you that you need to spend more time in the woods, or have more willpower, or a more positive attitude are really damaging to whatever effort it is you are currently making. And they continue to spread the message that mental illness is less serious and less important than ""real"" illnesses. And that's why we have a huge problem with substance abuse and not enough funding for mental health and rehabilitation.  As a supposed doctor, you should know this."

Genetics are interesting. I still don‚Äôt see why they care specifically about Latinos though. They don‚Äôt ask about my white ethnic background (e.g. Italian) or what type of Asian you are, what type of African, etc. why do they care if you speak Spanish? What if a 100% Spanish American were to fill out the census? Would they check Hispanic/ Latino since they are are a Spanish speaking country, even though they are white European for all intents and purposes?"
AskReddit,fmx48ai,t1_fmuohwj,1586458174.0,Why would they care about Latinos any more than where whites are from specifically? It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter to me. We are all American. Do I check that I am Latino even if I am only half and my parents and myself were born in the United States? I consider more American than anything else.
