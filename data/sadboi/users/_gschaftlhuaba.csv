Mentioning that you don't want or even like kids is like speaking manadrin to them.

Their views are very old fashioned, many get children at a young age. They never even plan on seeing the world, doing something unusual, some girls don't even want to get more education than necessary because they are only focused on becoming mothers. Same with most guys btw.

So yes, my childhood surroundings did somehow force me to become the same like them.

All of her pregnancies have been more than problematic. Doesn't make her stop because it's soo beautiful having crotch goblins, we get it.

Her post basically said that she was SO glad to be bed bound and not allowed to move at all during her pregnancy, like she doesn't have to go out and risk herself and her little princess. Last words were something like ""I'd always choose this kind of pregnancy over normal acitivities"".

We had mostly seen each other on weekends, and he had been acting weird the last few times we had met. I asked him multiple times what was wrong, he didn't tell me. Well, not until that one saturday night. He was at the local bar where he got drunk. We went outside, he said there's something I should know. He then told me that he had one son with his ex, which was an accident. The other two (I think 1 girl 1 boy) are from one night stands.

He claimed that he didn't know anything about these two pregnancies until it was ""too late"". He went on complaining that now he has to pay child support for all 3 of them, doesn't have any money to live, and that these girls only wanted him to get them pregnant so they wouldn't have to work. 

As you can imagine, I was pretty baffled. I asked him how something like that could have happened, and he said that one girl ""manipulated the condom"". This even went to court, as someone was lying next to them while they had sex (like, wtf) and this dude had to testify that. He didn't have an answer for the third.

Well, as I said, I noped the fuck out. 
He didn't take that very well; I can't count how many insulting texts I got. Calling me a ""selfish whore"" and worse for ""not staying with him, just because his times are hard at the moment"". 

Just because?! Dude, you don't have hard times. Your life is messed up.
