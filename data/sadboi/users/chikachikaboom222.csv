stepparents,fqtzxax,t3_gkm5jm,1589649325.0,"The irony of this situation is,  good kids that have bio parents who parent them do not need anymore parenting from the steps.  You can just relax and claim your place in the family, like an adult friend, aunt etc.

However if you marry someone who has no clue about parenting,  or worse guilt parenting and has an ex who is the same or worse being, a toxic parent,  what are the steps to do?  They have to exercise some kind of control, or they will just be a victim of this family dynamic.   The real victim here is the child, nobody is parenting them properly, adults around them are in a power struggle loop, just toxicity all the way around.

The Step needs to have a proper place in the family, one who is respected, acknowledged and cherished. Kids should know how to be grateful,  always have thank you, please, in their vocabulary.  Bio Mom has a cordial relationship with everyone, and has no agenda, no left over toxicity from the divorce/previous relationship. Father is still the main person/leader but knows how to put kids in place at the same time appreciating the Step role in their lives, as his example is being followed.

Steps often find themselves in a dysfunctional family dynamic because it's already laid out like this and they are told to just take it and be distant stepparents.  You can either contribute negatively or positively in a child's life, there's no middle ground.

Stay out of a lose-lose situation.  Life is short to be a source and receiver of a toxic family dynamic if you have no power to change it.  Women can do better than this."
stepparents,fqsjjmw,t1_fqsaxsd,1589609058.0,"Everything is context.  The situation posted by OP sounds like he's playing a game of hot potato,  and even reacted worse after the fact and even calls it a bacteria.  Im a nurse who takes part of pre counseling for mothers who opts for abortion for health risks,  and calling it a bacteria is violently ignorant. Would your SO call it an embryo/fetus a bacteria?  Only an ignorant weasel will say that.   

Most of these men are already fathers and had given  their heart to a child (children) before they met their second/third wives  or gf's. So it's pretty common for them to not want kids anymore. Their reaction and commitment to you is very telling,  if he is too quick to say yes to termination of a potential life/kids with you."
stepparents,fqs51ph,t3_gk9y5o,1589598683.0,"I hope you're feeling better and being gentle with yourself.

Maybe subconsciously you know that this person is not the right person to raise a family with, hence these feelings that lead to terminating your pregnancy.   The worse is how he reacted,  you were going  through so much as it is, the confusion of everything  and he is not someone you can rely on when crisis like this happens.

&#x200B;

I am a mother and stepmother of three daughters (2 bio, one SD).  One of the things I hope for for them, is find a man,  a partner who has  a strong soul and character that will carry them through the toughest crisis.    I would rather see them alone than marry a weasel  or someone who doesn't believe in the same things that they believe in.  Or someone who makes them feel worse in a crisis.   There are so many weasels and weak men that women ruin themselves for.    I just wish for my daughters to marry a strong man,  that will say ""Its okay to have a baby,  I want it, we will raise it.  I will provide and I will take care of this family""   I wish that for all women and women on this sub.    If they cannot find this person in this lifetime, its okay to tread life alone. (I believe I raise them to be strong women who do not need to depend on the love of a weak man)

Maybe you know deep down,  this man is a weasel, a man with character as thick as an onion skin,  who has no solid values,  who goes where the wind takes him.  You deserve someone more than this.   And maybe you know this,  thus the abortion.  You just didn't feel right with the pregnancy and with the  man you're with.    You deserve so much more.   And when you are ready you could become the best mom,   or the best aunt  or the best person you can be.   This is possible when you find the right person."

AttachmentParenting,fpx6w93,t3_gfv1hh,1588976815.0,"You can always celebrate with us, who cherished the ease of having babies because of attachment parenting.  Looking back it also probably because the of energy the parents give out.  I personally was happiest when my I was pregnant and it continued on after they were born, and throughout the baby/toddler phase.  If the mom/parents have an easy soothing vibe/ energy about them, the baby feels the comfort of that energy too.   The most anxious moms, seem to have the most anxious babies.

If both babies and moms have a restful sleep together,  enjoy each other's companies, enjoy a deep connection because the mom responds to the baby's needs (not allowing to cry his/her little hearts out in the other room)   the baby will grow in trust with the parent.  No need for hysterics, tantrums, eating problems.

Yes you should celebrate but yes quietly.  The rest of the world just don't get it.   Enjoy and make the most of this time you have with your little one, it flies by so quick."

Stepmothering is a hero/martyr's calling but it doesn't need to be forever.  

I am a stepmom  and I did my martyring task, for a whole three years when SD was 9 to 11 years old and then I put my foot down.  She is now in college and we both enjoy the fruits of our labors. We treasure our presence in our lives but it was hell the first three years.  What helped most is that she has a bio mom that is completely checked out and my husband who was completely supportive and a good parent. 

We have our reasons why we married men with kids.  However, always look out for yourself.

stepparents,fpo8ng8,t3_gei1tg,1588780284.0,"Over coffee, my best friend shared with me her insights while in therapy

""If I got praised and got some affection during my teens from my parents, I wouldn't seek a man with kids and struggle with the same pain of being ignored.""

At that time I thought,  its such a strange take away from therapy.  We love whom we love and sometimes we just didn't care about these things when we marry them.

This friend of mine is a beautiful successful lawyer and everybody is scratching their heads at her choice for a husband. A mechanic with three kids.  She helps pay with child support and she constantly deals with their bio mom and the kids' bullshit.

She can't even talk to her own family being asian, (She's Taiwanese).  Asian parents would rather shit on their hands and clap,  than see their daughters marry someone with children.  It's a family shame if a daughter 'settles'  for a widower or a divorcee with kids and exwife/ bio mom to his kids  that will always have an upperhand  (first wives, in their culture, will always have the upper hand)

I learned a lot from seeing things from  and her family's perspective.  That is indeed 'abnormal' and 'hell and a half'  to be with someone with children.  It is a curse you do not want for your own daughters.

My bestfriend is just plowing along and thinking of divorce.  But in the interim, she's trying to learn as much as she can about herself on why she married someone with children.

(She is 'forced'  to pit herself against the kids, which is silly in her mind, cause she's this  grown up lawyer and has to have a constant competition with his kids, but this is her cross to bear and she doesn't want to play anymore.  She will get divorced soon)"

The real version of the man you married is the one with the kids.
 These type  of men needs a diversion from their life as a guilty weekend dad who is pressured to be liked and respected by kids who live with the ex. They need to be liked for their ego, they are in competition with the mother for the affection of these kids  and hes not interested in discipline, chores etc. He should not have married if he just wants a diversion. It's unfair to you and your baby."

Now my own kids are realizing the joy of learning without the traditional   (always mad overworked teacher and their unruly class)

Now no teachers are abused, threatened in schools, being undermined etc etc.  The kids  learn what they  want to learn when they want to learn it. 

As a parent I hope in the future they will look into distance learning as a legitimate part of public school system.  

Im just a parent lurking here sometimes and you guys are always frazzled about teaching and disciplining your students.  I read about how you guys are in the end of the rope and struggling to make it at the end of the day.    Distance learning is probably the best solution if children can't deal with coming to school and be the receiving end of bullying or bearing the negative environment in the classroom.  As my children says its a winwin situation.  My kids even learned how to code and avoid the teachers that they seem to not like."
