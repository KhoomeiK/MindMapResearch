Fable,fgffwwe,t1_fgf46u7,1580737579.0,"I do like it to be honest, but I prefer using a crossbow over the guns and receiving a higher grade one was cool, even though I know having a higher damage gun with 4 augment slots and the best augments (down to play style) installed is still technically better, but the firing of a gun can be questionable compared to the crossbow.  However I also wish you could get this at an earlier point in the game. Without online trades it's only possible to get this weapon after completing the main quest line. I am definitely happy I did. Fortunately when i completed the main quest i had only missed 5 that i had to run about to find. It was very satisfying to be honest, I've never done it before as generally I do dislike those style of quests (I'm still yet to have ever got all the silver keys, is that worth doing?) 
I'm glad that the new fable has said there will not be guns to be honest! But I'm curious how theyll take them out the game, were all these types of weapons destroyed by the spire?? Cant wait to find out how they approach it, and really hope there even more choices in the game which directly effects the environment and your own play through. Ofcourse that plus the fact the main story quest is a massive give give give is what makes fable fable, and keeps people coming back for more playthroughs over the years.

(Side note - super happy knothole island dlc offered augment removers)"
