I worked at a pretty popular restaurant in Chicago as a hostess. I saw a decent amount of celebrities there, but this one night we have a reservation pop up for DJ Khaled.

So in walks DJ Khaled looking normal as he could, with what I assume was his agent or manager or whatever. They request a table for eight.

Not a single person even seems to acknowledge that he‚Äôs in the building, nor be impressed at all. No one else from his posse ever shows up.
