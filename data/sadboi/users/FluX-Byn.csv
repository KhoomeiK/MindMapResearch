It's case by case and takes time but the meds they had me to try and resolve what they thought was BP got worse until i got treated for ADD and saw my life finally go forward instead.

adderall,fniw60y,t3_g1vbo3,1586987428.0," I agree with this in certain ways. Many people who are taking it and posting above dosages and tips to get high,  etc. Are completely unaware of what they are doing. Taking this stuff is highly harmful and addictive. On the other hand some who are self medicating with amphetamines may actually have a deeper problem and in some cases genuinely have ADD/ADHD. In my case i self medicated my bipolar 1 disorder and ADD for a while with meth and i got clean off it, however my psych decided to put me on a low dose of adderall of 10mg 2x a day (and i only take that as needed if needed.) To help deal with not only my untreated ADD which led in part to my illicit use, but also the residual BP depression when all other meds no longer worked as an added to my mood stabilizer. Meth and stimulants fucked up my dopamine receptors and led to anhedonia and worsening ADD, adderall helped my brain once again release dopamine and fixed it somewhat. I'll never fully recover from the damages of stimulants i've been told. This is one thing people don't know about stimulants they can leave you permanently fucked up in your motivation / pleasure ability. It's not wise to abuse them and it's not the pleasure you're after if you are doing it, you're actually running from something deeper. 10% is the drug 90% of the problem is you and trauma or other issues.

If you are taking more than you need, don't need it and lied. Are only taking it to focus solely instwad of actually understanding the other symptoms that come with these conditions i'd suggest rethinking abusing them. It's not worth it and addiction is horrible. Ever ""i'd never do that."" Will become ""i will and have done that."" Just to get a fix. It's not about willpower, you're rewiring your brain, changing the pathways and how they fire, you WILL become addicted."

For example recently i recently thought one day i didn't need to take it, i was fine. I got behind the wheel, i was driving and ended up in a car accident, it wasn't until them i realized that i did need them.

adderall,fici1c7,t1_ficabke,1582347792.0,"Idk about vyvanse per se I take adderall but in general all stimulants lose their initial ""buzz"" and enjoyment that happens when you start them. Your body tries to maintain homeostasis and slashes it's own dopamine receptors not to mention depleted dopamine makes each successive use less than the next. Don't chase the dragon, you'll never receive that initial feeling again. Going after that ""rush"" is the first step toward addiction. Take it and know that when that initial buzz, up, euphoric feeling is gone it's gone, stay at your therapeutic dose and don't up it. (Not saying you're using it to get high) just that many people fall to the trick where they think the initial reaction you get to these meds is supposed to stay or else it isn't working, that's not how it works. After 3 weeks you'll still have the focus and symptom relief of the stimulant without as much if a stimulant effect. Which honestly in my opinion is the best part, after 3 weeks you lose the ""rush"" also you'll lose the ""super sharp focused"" feeling, as in it'll become normal, you'll be focused without being so focused on being focused. The appetite loss goes away (great in my opinion cause you can hold food.) Idk how vyvanse is physically wise but be ready to not feel as jitters if that's an effect if any. 

All in all you'll still notice your symptoms improve in my case: 

Anhedonia (this is one of the main reasons I take it, but not due to ADD)
Impatience
Irritability
Impulsivity
Lack of focus
Lack of attention
Rapid speech
Spacing out improves
Memory improves

These things over all stay better, many people think these symptoms must not be benefiting if they don't feel the medicine working. That's not true, you may just get so focused at first on the experience itself on the substance rather than the experience improvement of your life. 

Take it from me chasing a high got my brain fucked up bad, that's why I developed severe ADD and also anhedonia ( TOTAL lack of pleasure from even mundane things) I can't enjoy even simple  chocolate anymore because I was stupid enough to chase getting high on stimulants because of that initial feeling. Why? Because your brain knows that's not normal and as a backup your brain starts destroying itself to even out. Even at therapudic doses this is what happens on a smaller level. If you go increasing your dose or changing to something stronger you're just delaying it and causing further damage to your brain each time."
adderall,fic6xto,t3_f7l68m,1582339136.0,"Expect maybe 3 weeks to begin seeing a tolerance develop. Mind you tolerance isn't bad, you lose the initial intensity but that doesn't mean you need to up the dose, many times the stimulant is still working but the novelty of it has worn off. Best way to compare is to make a list of your symptoms before and during the effects of the meds, if you notice the benefits continue despite the novelty if the medicine going away after 3 weeks there is no need to up the dose."

The last one being a real conundrum, in craving to escape suffering we create suffering. One can't escape suffering because suffering is the nature of existance. However we can escape suffering by not suffering more when we suffer. 

The way it's seen is concepts such as good, bad, right wrong, etc. Are human constructs, when all of it is removed what's left? Life, without judgement, without labels or ideas.

Yet nirvana goes against the 3 laws of existance which is no self, impermanence, and suffering.

adderall,fg455wz,t1_fg3u4bl,1580496380.0,"Besides inattention and hyperactivity for some these are some of the symptoms I experienced prior to treatment I have ADD not ADHD so my symptoms are different and vary, each person is different but generally:

* Irritability, this isn't just I'm in a bad mood sometimes thing. It's something that usually affects your relationships and life. People around you may usually say you're always defensive, cranky, or in a bad mood. You may not understand why but sometimes even when someone speaks to you about trivial things you find yourself irritated or upset easily, even at yourself, or objects. It's usually pretty consistent.

*abnormal sleeping patterns, now don't get me wrong with technology nowadays almost everyone tends to stay up until late and there are others causes possible not just this condition. However in many cases someone with ADD or ADHD will notice that for as long as they can remember they have had circadian rhythm issues, usually tiredness during the day yet when night comes they cannot sleep and feel more energized than usual, staying up until sunrise and then feeling extremely tired again during the day. This doesn't go away with removal of devices, old habits and is persistent usually has been present for years or most of your life, even with sleep schedule changes.

* Day dreaming at random times even when trying to focus. For me with ADD this is beyond simply dozing off or just loss of concentration. It's persistent, I will try to be listening to someone or make out what they mean yet I will space out and then come back to, this makes people believe I am ignoring them when I honestly cannot focus. These attention issues usually lead to feelings of ""I'm stupid."" ""Why can't I listen?"" And other negative self images or emotions. The reason ADD / ADHD inattention is different than regular inattention is not simply lack of FOCUS it's that one can't pay attention or direct ones awareness when wanted where wanted. Focus and attention aren't exactly the same. This affects quality of life.

* issues with being on time. Everyone is late sometimes but usually for me it's getting distracted about a million little things while trying to get somewhere or do something. Scheduling and such doesn't usually help much because regardless while trying to do your schedule or set it up you'll be unable once your mind starts running off.

* lack of motivation, idk about others and this may be because I have anhedonia also but even before this I had zero desire to do anything. It has affected me majorly. I have had issues with work and school because even though I want and try to do things there are times where I have zero drive behind it, I can try and get these things done and start but it feels empty and pointless. This leads to frustration, self esteem issues, and fatigue mentally or physically.

*disorganization, many of us have issues with organizing ourselves. Again others may experience this on one or two aspects of their lives but for me it's across the board. Whether room, work, plans, desk, etc. It's a mess and usually people tell you but it's a mess that it organized to you. You know where things are regardless, ironic that you remember things in disorder but not in order.

*searching for stimulation, some of us know subconsciously that we have an issue, we may not have known what it was but we know we sought a way to stimulate ourselves to CALM ourselves down. Others stimulate to keep up. This can lead to caffeine, behaviors, patterns, or even substance abuse in order to calm ourselves down and quiet our minds, not for euphoria. Usually when treated, strangely we lose desire for drugs or even thinking of abusing our meds, ADD/ADHD is higher risk for addiction if untreated, however with treatment that risk is significantly lower and many people find they don't develop or fall back to other addictions.

*impulse control issues, not as in you do something impulsively once or twice a week or month. Regularly and in ways that have hugely negative consequences. In my case this is a bit more extreme since I also suffer from bipolar 1 disorder, however even when my bipolar disorder is treated many of these symptoms never subside or in the case of this one do but not enough. This has led me to homelessness, sexual encounters which I regretted, saying / doing things at the wrong times. Sometimes while knowing I didn't want or shouldn't do it yet am driven to is as if by force. Regret usually follows and you experience inability to learn from these lessons, or you do but cannot apply that which you learned from these EXPERIENCES not just logic.

People forget or overlook that this isn't just learning difficulties and lack of focus, it's something that affects us in many ways. Sadly some doctors don't ask patients more detailed questions about their lives and this also feeds into the issue of why stimulants are abused and make it harder for those who need them to get a prescription.

Also not saying you are in particular drug seeking, but as a warning to others who may be and stumble across this:

Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs can have long term implications, because of them I developed anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure.) Without then in order to do so. Your dopamine system gets fucked up, not everyone but it's possible with high doses and I also believe everyone who takes them may over time experience this also to a lesser degree.
Your issues may get worse long term, psychosis can happen if abused or even at normal doses long term. In the case you have another condition knowingly or not:  schizophrenia, bipolar, etc and are not being monitored by a doctor you could setiously destroy your life by setting off an episode. Sudden risk of heart attack or stroke are possible at any time with these drugs, it's not often but possible. Your cardiovascular system and nervous system also notice changes and effects. Among a long list of other things.

Again this will NOT diagnose you, only a qualified psych can, they know whether it is due to this or other mental health or physical conditions and will help you. Don't assume that because you have all or some of these it means you have ADD / ADHD."

He told me it was fine so long as I wasn't taking above the prescribed dose, that if anything and I did have to provide info my script would be valid and that if last resort my blood text showed that I didn't have exceeding amounts in my system I'd be fine.

He's told me before to not try skipping doses because I also take it for anhedonia. So honestly it was my fault for avoiding it. Definetelt not making that mistake again and will be talking to him about it next time I see him."

Some weight loss Is usual since you may sometimes forget to eat occasionally. I suggest if you can taking weekends off.

Once you adjust you may not be as hungry but you'll definetely be able to eat without feeling nauseous or unable to put it down. In can eat just fine now but instead of my body telling me I'm hungry, thought it still happens, I'll just need to recall it's time to eat.

Ps don't make the mistake of turning to sugar and processed foods when you do get hungry or because it is easier to pass. You need to eat healthier since your body is getting less food. Try doing light stuff, salads, fruits, proteins. And not as many Refined carbs. I also suggest a multivitamin especially with magnesium."

spirituality,fg17f60,t1_fg16k99,1580422195.0,"Honestly it depends, but you will know. The subconscious voice is subtle and almost whispers to you. It'll be insight that leads to a realization you never knew that opens your eyes. For example: 

""Why do I lie?"" Your subconscious says because you want to avoid being guilty""

""When did I learn to lie in order to avoid this feeling.?""

You subconscious may surprise you by telling you something like:

""You saw your father tell ""white lies"" to your mom to avoid getting into trouble, so ever since then you learned that lying is a way to avoid responsibility.""

Bam eyes opened, it'll be something you never knew or was hidden from you usually as a child.

You should also feel a ""release"" upon this realization.

In my case since I started awakening I have a strange buzzing sound in my head that guides me. Usually it goes off when I receive ""downloads"" or when I realize something. I'll know if the first is true and I notice this buzzing sound change tone and pattern in a specific way. Usually after this that behavior starts to slip and my mind quiets further and thoughts slowly become subtler.

If it exposes fear, guilt, etc then you know it's not the ego because the ego's job is self defence, exploit it by knowing that it hates being exposed."

spirituality,fg1663d,t3_ewbiq3,1580421522.0,"That works at first until you get to a stage where you need to relent control, how can you stop controlling something is choosing to stop is control. All that is needed to remove a negative belief is simply finding the root of it. 

If you have a feeling something bad is going to happen then instead of trying to transform it and run from the fear that induces in order to feel better try: 

""Why do I feel something bad is going to happen?""

Intuition? This is a good thing and normal we just get in our own heads and are so used to logi. We avoid the subtle.

If for another reason (usually is) then:

""When was the last time I felt this way?""

Don't answer consciously, allow your subconscious to tell you.

Then ask why.

Finally after finding out ask ""when was the first time and who / what situation made me feel like this?""

Usually something in childhood, we carry those fears through to adulthood projecting it endlessly ignorant of it. Once you find out and shed light on what exactly it was, who, and when you felt this. Ask yourself ""what was I trying to avoid, what was I really afraid of? Why?"" 

Again allow your subconscious to answer, usually as soon as the truth becomes evident that behavior no longer limits you and the fear and behavior goes along with it. As long as you try to avoid the cause, the feelings, and remain ignorant to their root it will not change or it will but it will manifest in your life in a new way until you do."

AskReddit,ffwsy9l,t1_ffwnqh4,1580310260.0,"I can see why you're confused, but your post actually validates my point. It's not something that can be explained easily in terms of concepts, it must be experienced to understand. 

Jesus said ""Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, ""The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you."" - Luke 17:21 

If heaven is within us then we should be focusing in where in us that treasure is. (Desire) the eye (referred to singular) is a symbol across many religions, the eye of horus, the third eye in Hinduism,  taoism teaches of the mind's eye between the two eyes. The all seeing eye seen or providence. A symbol of enlightenment and the eye of God. There's a very good reason for this and it is our way to see God, again this is why Jacob named the place pineal (the pineal gland is associated with the third eye.) It's undeniable and true, right now each one of us is using it but unaware of it because it is so subtle yet illuminates everything. It this eye is light (enlightened) your being will be light.

Contrast this with the next part where it says eyes referring to the physical eyes, a contrast between seeing with that of the spiritual vs seeing with that of the flesh, then your whole body will be full of desire/ greed / selfishness. He continues to explain that if then the light within you  (the same eye that is spiritual.) Is dark or ignorant / unaware or unhealthy greedy because our nature is selfish due to this same ignorance or original sin which keeps it unhealthy. in comparison/ parallel to physical blindness then how much greater is that suffering, ignorance, or unhealthy thinking or greed /  selfish egoic state of mind.

As far as all saying 1 truth this is indisputable, each religion may have different views, traditions, practices, or textual differences, or claims, However the 1 truth is truth regardless. Again because these texts try to explain that which is ineffable no true explanation by our limited concepts can truly grasp it, it can only be verified by experience.  God can be described in many ways but even so no words could ever grasp the full nature or proper justice.

It's not that they are false, it's that they are more true than you could ever imagine. Once seen all answers to the questions such as: why does God allow suffering? If he knew Adam and eve would sin why did he create the tree of good and evil? Etc are answered. 

The direction they all point to is enlightenment / self realization / salvation. Jesus was killed for our sins (ignorance) because he spoke these truths in order for us to be saved from our suffering and ignorance. He did die and resurrect, this is no lie. Following in him and believing (believing is not just acknowledging his death and that he was God in flesh. It means dying to self and following his teachings, crucifying your own flesh / ego.) Leads one to enlightenment, this truth will set you free and you will not only see God but also see that in fact you are given life everlasting as promised just not in the way we expected. The purpose of all religions and spiritual practices is exactly this, death of the ego. 

One can't look for God outside of himself and want to find him. By Christian texts God breathed the breath of life (his own breath) into Adam. If then the very breath of God is within you (the spirit which returns to God when man dies) one must turn inward to find him. Heaven is within you, and in heaven is God. Your body is the temple of God, so then approach approach his throne and find him. ""Be still and know that I AM - God."" 

When asked what his name was by moses God said ""I am that I am."" Or ""I Am"" tell them that ""I AM"" sent you. Jesus said ""before abraham was born, I AM."" 
These two words were the reason he was crucified. This is why the Jews were the ones to understand what this really meant.

I AM - (is) the light of the world.
I AM - (is) the good Shepard
I AM - (is) the resurrection and the life.
I AM - (is) the (one) truth, the way, and the life."
