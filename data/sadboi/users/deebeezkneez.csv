Perspective is the only thing that helps me. If I think about what my daughter wants at her very core, it is for her children to be safe and happy. I can give them that, but not if I am enmeshed in her drama.

Deep down in her soul, what does your mother want for you? She probably wants you to be happy more than anything. I bet she doesn't want to drag you down with her. They know. They really do. They feel abandoned, but they know they are abandoned because of things they did, not things you did.

Do what you need to do to be happy and free to live your life. You can still love her and wish the best for her. It's okay to love an addict and not be involved with them."

Now that I understand what my problem is, they can probably help me more. It's a good idea. I agree with your sentiment. The kids are unusual because they came with no possessions and still don't ask for toys. The few they have, they rarely play with because they love their tablets and being wherever I am more. I count the seconds after I walk into my room as entertainment and they usually wander in within two minutes. I can't scold them, because they missed a lot of hugs and attention and the trauma experts say to just give them as much as they need until their cup is full.

It takes a LOT of time and consistency for kids who've been without to feel safe and secure and to trust anything. But it's what they want most of all.

Board games. Cards. Charades. Anything where they get full attention. After dinner exercise because if they can fall asleep well, the mind will try to heal. It helps my 8yo to physically wrestle, with me or the dog. In the summer, I have them run laps in the yard and make a game of it.  A lot of ""We are all in this together"" 
reminders. Everyone gets do-overs if they are impolite, angry, impulsive, whatever. The point is to practice the right way, grow those neuronal pathways. Provide a LOT of food in case they have food fear. (I used to have to keep at least 4 dozen eggs in the fridge, and one of mine used to carry cold scrambled eggs around in a baggie and eat them that way.) 

Mine still call me various names, and I'm their grandmother. Sometimes it's my grandmother name, sometimes Mommy, sometimes very well enunciated GRANDMOTHER, as though they are labeling me in their mind. I don't care what they call me. I answer to anything. 

I would not call them son right away, but really, you'll take your cues from the boy or boys.

NoContract,fbgpqxu,t3_ed3jmm,1576855726.0,"I've been using Verizon Visible for 4 months now, moved from regular Verizon. I haven't noticed any difference in service except for one 3-day period, which they fixed with an update and an email notification of the fix. $40/month, no contract. It's a ""pre-release"" program from Verizon run from one office in Denver, so customer service is online and not fast, but I've only needed them once during set up. I have no clue if there is a difference in coverage. There shouldn't be, since it's owned by Verizon."

Parenting,fbe66jl,t1_fbdzsfb,1576779081.0,"Some things that have been helpful to me from all the trauma-based classes and talks I've heard may or may not apply to your siblings. I tell them Yes as often as I can and it's taken 2 years for them to start feeling safe having a voice of their own - enough to disagree with me. Every yes is a ""you matter."" Every lapse of care by their mother has sent a message that they don't matter.

Everyone in the house gets to do ""do-overs"" too. Lose your temper? You can try again. Say something hurtful? You can take it back and to it over.

Don't do what I did and run your house like a holding place for the addict mother. Take a picture of you with them and put it on the wall, acknowledging your new family. Put everyone up there so they know you are proud of every single person and situation that created the children they are. Don't hide their story. Secrets are toxic.

Find the Kinship Navigator program through your state. They may provide resources. If not, maybe you can use your political knowledge in the future to help the rest of us who are not as savvy. Since you got your siblings through DHS, you probably have resources. Those of us who didn't, get almost no assistance, not even with adoption.

Sometimes my kids just start missing mommy or an old toy or something from their past. Expect that and allow them to have those days. I'm retired, so I can let them stay home from school to be sad, but if they go to school on a sad day, let the teacher know and they will accommodate them - even do things like let them eat lunch with the counselor. I've found schools to be a great resource for many things. They even referred me to people they thought would be good babysitters for the kids. Then, when you all get home, keep things around for good snuggle/hunker down nights. Movies, popcorn, fuzzy blankets, footie pajamas and delivery pizza so no one has to cook or clean. 

I've also found that old, familiar things, even if they are not healthy, are good for their hearts once in a while. My kids were malnourished, so I was hyper-diligent about their diet. But then I took them to McDonalds one day, because they kept asking. You would have thought I gave them a $1000 gift, it made them so happy. Recently, they discovered a show they used to watch when they were little and left in front of the TV all day. They were both so happy to watch this baby-ish show because it was part of their past.

If there is a local Mom and Dad FB group, join it. If there's not a dad one, join the mom one. They can give you specific referrals for every little thing that will come up. Birthday parties? New to the area and need to make friends? Pediatric dentists? They have all that shit on speed-dial.

That's all I have for now, but reach out any time."

ChildrenofAddicts,faiztti,t3_e92o3j,1576120641.0,"I can't help you with your question, but I want to thank you for the detailed post. I hired a PI to get my grandchildren and I feel guilty about that a lot, because I took my own child's children. It's been a hard few years because of the life they were living, but they are finally pretty settled. Your post helps me remember why I did what I did - because no one deserves to be treated the way they were.

It sounds like this is a natural progression to me. You coped. Then you had a child. Now you have a TON of new information about the choices and sacrifices a parent makes. I can see why it must feel like a kick in the guts sometimes, to wonder why you didn't get the same kind of love and attention. 

If you haven't tried One Meal A Day eating, look into it. It allows you to be gentle on yourself because you don't really need to worry about WHAT you eat and you can enjoy your food. And you can do it loosely or very intense. Make sure you read about autophagy because it's interesting."

meth,fa9cguq,t1_fa96jsy,1575868706.0,"Did your parents ever give up hope? I moved far away from my AD and she rarely even asks for $5 anymore, but I am broken inside. I am a 67 yo single mom of her 2 children and the shadow of their mother lurks over our house, leaving an ever-present residue of sorrow on everything. I wake up in the night with a heart rate of 130, so afraid and my mornings are full of dread.

If I stopped caring, stopped making an effort to let her know I still care, if I didn't keep her present in her childrens' lives, it would be easier. 

So what I want to know is does it ever matter if a parent hangs in there and lets you know you will always be welcome home sober because you are already forgiven?

Sometimes I think the tough love people whose children are basically dead to them are right, but I cannot bring myself to go that far.

Life by it's very nature includes great sorrow, so I figure it's on me to learn how to deal with it.

Sorry this isn't written better - I'm rambling a bit, but hopefully you'll get the gist of what I'm asking."

Your post sounds more like a cry for meaning than a need to see the world and have adventures. It feels like you're missing a deep and abiding reason to keep going.
