I think the new one I bought previously had some type of defect out of the box, never had issues until it died, although windows kept telling me there was a hardware error since day 1. Im hoping I can find someone to fix it. Haven't found any place near me that can do that. Does anyone know if microcenter has that service or someplace else?"
