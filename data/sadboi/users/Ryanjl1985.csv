horror,fqtqki7,t3_gkpvd3,1589644161.0,"So there used the be this thing at my church every year around Halloween called “The Judgement House”. A Christian version of a haunted house. 

It was basically a walkthrough of a staged house with actors playing a storyline that you follow from room to room (really cool concept imo). 

But in the story there would always be one bad kid and one good kid (one who accepts Jesus or whatever and one who doesn’t)... So at the end of the walkthrough you would be taken to hell and it would show you where the “bad kid” went. It was fucking terrifying!... demons, fire, blood, screaming, begging for water, etc. 

Then you would be taken to heaven where the “good kid” went... There were (of course) angels, white lights, Jesus, people singing, the works. Jesus himself would even come up to you and be like “yo, I’m Jesus”

I just sit and mindfully observe my thoughts. Where are they coming from? Idk. But they’re there, that’s for sure. Where do my emotions come from? Idk. But they’re there. If they are there then it would seem something created them. That “something” is irrelevant to me because it gets into philosophy and/or science that I don’t claim to understand or care about. 

I meditate because it brings me into this moment. It helps me feel what I’m trying to avoid. It helps me detach from and observe my thoughts in a way that nothing else ever has.

Meditation,fqa71ko,t3_ghpz8r,1589213955.0,"In my opinion the physical act of meditation is not a spiritual thing. There’s science behind it and it works. It’s your mind observing your brains creations. It’s bringing your awareness to your breathing. Your senses. Your emotions. So as far as whether the “self” exists or not is irrelevant to the actual practice. Sit with your breath. Let your thoughts come, label them, and let them pass. Let your emotions arise, examine them mindfully, and let them pass. Don’t over think it (easier said than done, I know). 

Side note: This could very well be your brain coming up with excuses not to meditate. I know for me I don’t want to meditate a lot of the time but when I do I’m almost never disappointed. So sit through all those thoughts of “do I exist?” “What is the self?” “Does the self exist?” and let them pass. If they want to stay longer, mindfully allow them but sooner or later they will pass. Just trust the “process” and forget about all the spiritual woowoo stuff. 

That’s my two cents."
