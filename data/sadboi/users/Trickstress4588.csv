When I was doing my college program down at Disney World, I had the opportunity to be in the Cast Member choir for Candlelight Processional which is a Christmas show that happens at Epcot that's a bunch of singing from the various choirs and then a celebrity narrator reads some of the passages from bible about the birth of Jesus and everything. The Cast Member choir is staged in a tree-like formation around the celebrity narrator with the tallest at the bottom and shortest at the top.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I happened to be in bottom row right next him and during Silent Night, he looks around at the crowd and the audience (since there was a section where we encourage the crowd to sing with us) and he's crying and I'm tearing up a bit because it was just a powerful moment and he reaches out and holds my hand and that man is just so sweet. I performed 2 shows with him that day and he did it for the second show as well. He apparently fills in the schedule whenever there's a gap or a different narrator cancels.

Thank you Mr. Olmos for being so wonderful and giving me a great Christmas memory!"

Currently working at Pandora and will offer my opinion.

NTA.

The rose gold rings in particular are rose plated over sterling silver, the ALE means sterling silver, and depending on wear, the plating can wear off in as soon as a year. The CZ can be fine but I know it really what people expect in an engagement ring. Yeah, Pandora can be a good promise ring but I personally agree that it's not exactly engagement material unless both parties agree beforehand or even one of the 14k ones."
