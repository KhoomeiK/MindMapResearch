Now whilst you might not be able to show the latter without any actors and such, it‚Äôs still immensely important to show that you‚Äôre competent with cameras, software and more to show that even without friends or actors to make films with, you can still work in a filming environment and you know what you‚Äôre doing which‚Äôll reassure them that you‚Äôll be a good student! So with that in mind, here are some things you can do which will help your portfolio:

1) Take photos and edit them in a software like Lightroom or Photoshop!

2) Film some things and edit them using something like Premiere Pro or Avid!

Overwatch,f9k9jdn,t1_f9k8g5z,1575395760.0,"Not entirely, because whilst I did say the damage would out-weight the healing I meant if there were three people who could do a lot of damage (2 Offense and her as Support) but she would still be doing something that helped her team too on the side, y‚Äôknow? So whilst those three are peeling/shredding she‚Äôs providing protection and strategic routes where Tanks/DPSs can deal damage, whilst another Support is giving out actual healing which I think ought to be possible depending on who it might be! 

But after a lot of points raised by other people here, it might actually be better if she did heal but she was something like a shield-based healer like another person said, y‚Äôknow?"
Overwatch,f9k90xc,t1_f9k7opn,1575395445.0,"I wish they could settle on an identity with her too and she does feel a little out of place with the way she plays compared to her class!!!!! Offense for me means a Hero with maximum 300 health, with some damage based abilities and an Ultimate made to create POTGs, y‚Äôknow? But Symmetra isn‚Äôt that because she has an ability which benefits her team and her Ult makes a bit ol‚Äô shield which isn‚Äôt made necessarily for POTGs. I personally think that a shield-based healer could work or like I said, a Hero who has a function but it‚Äôs more to the benefit of their team rather than just simply healing! Although after some consideration by other people, it might probably be better if Symmetra healed in some way rather than just shields, so maybe a direction that could be taken is that she becomes a secondary healer like Lucio or something like that! 

Blizzard probably won‚Äôt do anything else because it‚Äôs already been two reworks which is probably too much, but maybe with 2/2/2 this could give a better sense of what she could be and what other Supports could do to!"
Overwatch,f9k87o3,t1_f9k2kmr,1575394942.0,"That‚Äôs pretty true too and it‚Äôs also why Brigitte was made to be more Supporty rather than Tanky like another person said! If that‚Äôs the case, then I might have another idea instead for how Symmetra could go back into being a Support!

I like to think that other Support characters could exist that don‚Äôt just heal, but you are right that currently it seems that in the 2/2/2 system you need two healers to be the most effective. So, a few Brig mains I‚Äôve heard from have an issue with her current state which is the state of her Armor Packs. She gets three charges but this makes her play-style a little more awkward because whilst hitting people in the front for her Passive she also needs to look at the back to heal which makes her a target to the enemy team. Some people have suggested that Brigitte gets a system similar to Tolbjorn‚Äôs Armor Packs, except when she throws them out it also provides Armor and not just healing! So what if this happened instead:

-Brigitte‚Äôs charges get replaced with an Armor Pack meter which heals and provides armor! 

-Symmetra gets what Brigitte had and now she has three charges which provide shields instead of Armor! 

Generally, I just personally honestly think that Symmetra ought to fit into Support in some shape or form. Whilst she doesn‚Äôt heal she‚Äôs still got some things which make her more Support than simple DPS and it‚Äôs generally bothered me a lot after her move to Offense. Either way, it‚Äôs just something I wanted to address and I think something added like passive Shields or a way to increase said shields would be beneficial for her and fit her into a less awkward spot, y‚Äôknow?"
Overwatch,f9jz932,t1_f9jxogq,1575389284.0,"True, true! Although I personally feel that with how powerful Symmetra‚Äôs primary-fire is along with the other DPS‚Äô damage and the added rechargeable shields, it could potentially result in the damage out-weighing the healing the enemy team has! And even then there‚Äôd still probably be a main healer like a Moira who can heal multiple targets with her healing Orb and use her spray too!"
OverwatchUniversity,f9jx2wy,t1_f9dtwha,1575387840.0,"Why you're very welcome, bud and I aim to help any who might need some advice playing Brig! \^w\^"
OverwatchUniversity,f9daq81,t3_e463hw,1575231750.0,"There are a lot of comments here and a lot of things for me to say but what personally helped me a lot as a Brigitte main was this guide here! 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/d841za/brigitte_guide_by_a_gm_support_player/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

My personal rules of thumb which I learned from playing Brig/from the guide are this:

1) Always keep your Passive up while stacking that with your health-packs. To do this, I would highly recommend  always holding down your primary fire, as there are no repercussions if you do so like it said in the guide and you‚Äôre always ready for battle! Plus a Tracer, Reaper, Doomfist or someone else can always come out of nowhere and that way you‚Äôll always be prepared and able to activate your Passive immediately! 

2) Your long-range ability is your best friend and use it to activate your passive when the enemies are far-away. Plus it‚Äôs also pretty powerful too due to the knockback and damage of it! 

3) She works the best when shielders like Orisa and Reinhardt are present and if you have any shielders then work closely to them. Sigma can work but not all the time and to 100% be effective with him whilst playing Brig it‚Äôs recommended that there must be communication between you two! If you‚Äôre much more adept at Brigitte then you can play with off-tanks and Sigma without coms but not D.Va or Hammond. This is generally because their game plan is to not stay close to your team and they only come back for heals, plus an Armor Pack from long range isn‚Äôt enough depending on the damage they‚Äôve taken. Overall, work with Tanks aside from those two so that you can heal them effectively with your Passive and charges! 

4) Be careful of positioning and don‚Äôt go fully into the battle. Just focus on keeping your Passive up by hitting the enemy and putting your Armor Packs on your allies, but of course if your team‚Äôs doing well then you can push and destroy them! 

5) Master shield-dancing (The act of keeping your Passive up to heal yourself and deal damage while also putting your shield up to protect yourself)! 

5) Use your Ultimate either defensively or offensively. When going for the offense, your Ult can provide some pretty good protection and be a good thing to use to charge the enemy head-on. Then when using it defensively (like being trapped in a Sigma ult) it‚Äôll increase their survivability and it‚Äôll allow for the other support to stay alive so they can heal your team with the extra armor on. Don‚Äôt know if that made sense but I hope you get it! 

I will say that even with these tips and Violet‚Äôs plays, I still think Brigitte needs a buff of some sort to her healing and most definitely to her shield! With her character, personality and how she‚Äôs supposed to be played, ‚Äúshield-dancing‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt sound right for her and a buff to her healing would be good to get a greater advantage over other Supports who can do her job better. Plus Blizzard should most definitely increase her difficulty rating because there is no way she‚Äôs an easy 1 star Hero!!!!! She might have been before because all you needed to do was s m a s h and occasionally throw out an Armor Pack, but things have changed and there‚Äôs a lot more that needs to be kept in mind when playing her."

Those things are beyond us and we‚Äôre all people with our own complex stories, while also fighting together against the true evils of the world. And that honestly, is so, so beautiful and we need more shows like that. We shouldn‚Äôt just point to those things like the idea of race or different sexualities/genders and make characters who only serve a purpose to show a message, but instead have them exist to serve the purpose of existing in a story.

TheDragonPrince,f8enr0n,t1_f8dw4oj,1574531003.0,"2. You‚Äôre absolutely right about that unfortunately being the case for a lot of same-sex couples on TV and just to clarify, I never meant to seem like one of those people and I am sorry if I did! It honestly annoys be a hell of a lot too like Ruby and Sapphire from Steven Universe as an absolute clear example of this. You can quite clearly see they‚Äôre in a relationship AND married but for some reason people still don‚Äôt register that and say they‚Äôre ‚Äújust friends‚Äù. Plus because of this it then results in the creators of a series having to show concrete examples of kissing and more to show that they do actually love each other romantically, only for it to be seen as ‚Äúforced‚Äù by a lot of people. 

But I will agree that if that‚Äôs the case with what she wrote in sign language then it is a little left field and out of nowhere. I personally don‚Äôt necessarily see how there could be a whole lot of emotional, romantic tension between the two when they‚Äôve been on opposite sides of the border for long periods of time, and when they do interact it was originally just to do some hardcore fighting. If they did know each other before then I would expect them to not act as angry or as bloodthirsty for each other like it was shown in season 2 and 3. As well as this, personally for me a few episodes before the end of the season seems a little too soon for a romantic build-up and I honestly think it would have made a little more sense if Janai dated glasses girl.

OverwatchUniversity,f87qcoh,t3_dzg1et,1574340048.0,"The only advice I can unfortunately give is to just keep on playing the game and to improve on your aim/Overwatch experience from there. Overwatch was the first game I ever really played and I used to beat myself up a lot about my aim, but ya‚Äô just gotta keep playing and your aim will improve, friendo, I promise!

What I can also do aside from my small piece of advice to you is recommend certain Heroes which might be able to help you with your aiming! For Offense, the best Hero for new players of Overwatch and of FPSs in general in my view is Soldier: 76! The way his firing works will help with your aim, he has pretty reliable damage and a reliable Ultimate, and on top of that he can heal people which might get you interested in playing Support! For Tanks, Roadhog is an excellent pick because he‚Äôs incredibly simple but very good too! All ya‚Äô gotta do is land your hook, shoot, heal, and that‚Äôs all there really is too him! But I would recommend Soldier first, as he‚Äôll give you some great knowledge on how to do well in the game and he‚Äôs better in leaning how to aim!"
Overwatch,f7l0klz,t1_f7kthgx,1573830386.0,"True true and I would personally say the same for Baptiste too!

Some more omnic characters would be cool though, like an evil omnic or the leader of Null Sector or something along those lines!"
Overwatch_Memes,f7l039i,t1_f7kipey,1573830119.0,"Exactly!!!! Brig's passive is good but it's unfortunately unnoticeable most of the time so that's why she gets a lot of flack for not ""doing a lot"" and if played incorrectly, it just keeps seeming like you're dying all the time. 

And yep, she does indeed have a Passive! It's called ""Inspire"" and she heals your teammates in a large radius for 6 seconds when she hits an enemy! It is actually a pretty good passive if farmed right and stacked with your Armor Packs, but the only problem is that it's a little unnoticeable!"

Overwatch,f75gthk,t3_duak69,1573414932.0,"So this incident needs a bit of context behind it to be fully understood....

When I started playing Overwatch right after it‚Äôs launch, I got the assumption that Tolbjorn could make more than 1 Sentry Turret, from something that didn‚Äôt even relate to Overwatch..... For some reason, I thought he could make more because in the TF2 Meet the Engineer video, you can see that the Engineer‚Äôs made more than one turret at the end, and considering a lot of people compared Tolbjorn to the Engineer, I thought that somehow this meant he could make more than one. Even when both games are completely different titles, AND even when on top of that the Engineer himself can‚Äôt even make more than one turret, I still thought he could do that from that video and I always got confused when people like Stylosa would only put one turret down on his Tolbjorn tips video.

So one day, I decide to play Tolbjorn on Quick Play, only to find out the hard way about the fact that he clearly cannot make more than one. I placed my turret on top of the room right next to the Gibraltar attacking spawn, and then I placed it on the bridge facing that spawn. It was only after looking back at the previous spot though that I realized the dark, dark reality of the Engineer and Tolbjorn:

‚ÄúOh shit he can only make one OH FUCK-‚Äú

And then I immediately got killed after that exact moment. XD I then stopped playing Tolbjorn afterwards but then I started to main him again until the role queue system where I‚Äôm now a Support main!"
Overwatch,f72y227,t3_du90xp,1573384279.0,"I actually personally think one or two Brig buffs are actually needed for her in general, as not only have the tables turned against her as a Tracer counter but compared to other Supports she needs to really grind to do any significance and she needs specific Heroes like shield Tanks to really do well. What I would personally suggest is this:

1) Increase her shield health to 300, so she can do more in terms of shield-dancing and have an advantage against enemy Tracers. 

2) Bump up her Inspire ability so she can not only heal her team more but also give herself more self-heal to sustain damage. Compared to other Supports, I feel like she just isn‚Äôt too viable when compared to other Heroes like Lucio who can just heal passively and amp up his healing to help his team more, so this way she‚Äôll have a better edge to consider when creating a team comp."

Overwatch,f6mkk8l,t1_f6egexp,1572974463.0,"It is true that whilst Double Shield can be good for Brig if it's on her team, when it's the other way around it makes things so much harder to really do anything with your passive which is probably the most important part of her kit....  But I actually really like how she feels nowadays and the complexities of her play style! I know that the suggestion I wrote makes it seem like I'm completely against the way Brig is nowadays, but after playing Brigitte more and watching how pro players play her in her new form, I would actually say that I now love the direction Brigitte was taken in so much more now and I think this was a great decision the crew did for her to combat the issues of her play-style! I never really had an issue with the rework she was given to begin with (which might seem that way from what I proposed), but what I would say is that if the crew are fully going forward with a main-healer Brig then here is what I would propose for that!

\-Bump-up heal-rate for her passive.

\-Increase her shield from 200 to 300 or maybe just 250.

I propose an increase to her passive because compared to Lucio (who is another area-of-effect healer), Brigitte really needs to grind and stack her Armor Packs with her passive to help her team which just ends up making her redundant in a way. Lucio however can reliably heal by just staying alive and clicking a button to increase it, which in a way might be why Brig is seen more now as a non-viable Support Hero in a lot of matches compared to others. On top of that, staying alive as Brig is made a whole lot more difficult when you haven't got any shield-Tanks on your team, because their shield allows you to heal the Tank and your teammates who cover behind the shield to do the best healing. When it's just you and two off-tanks, healing is made increasingly more difficult and you become an easy target for the enemy team However with her passive increased, it would not only increase her survivability, but it would also give her an edge on other Heroes to make her more viable in my view! Plus with her shield buffed, it won't be as paper-thin as it is currently and you can effectively use the shield in more ways, like potentially giving you more seconds to live which you could use to escape or it would buff a Brig main when they ""shield dance""!

Overall, I just propose either buffing Brig in some way if she's to fully remain a Support or to have another rework!"
Overwatch,f6fljjy,t1_f6ea83b,1572815691.0,"I 100% agree on the shield too and it's something I've personally really noticed that request among Brigitte mains which'll hopefully mean the crew will fix it! Whilst my suggestion was to make her more into what she originally was along with the charges, I'm actually completely fine with what she's been reworked to and I hope that this might mean she can be buffed into more of a main healer with more survivability! 

I personally think the Brigitte that should be aimed for is one that still feels like a Support instead of just someone that can smash enemies to provide healing, but one that can still brawl effectively with her big hitboxes!"

Overwatch,f205b9r,t1_f2033a9,1569855463.0,"See a lot of people say the same thing too and I completely agree with being aggressive/brawling! Whilst she isn't the same hybrid Tank/Support like she was before, she can still do some good healing with Inspire when your teammates are close and they're rushing in aggressively, y'know? In my experience with Reaper though, almost 95% of my engagements with him when he comes from behind have unfortunately been a failure... I personally don't believe it's because I use my abilities wrong or anything like that (because it can be pretty simple to get him or Doomfist killed on paper with your stun and Whiplash), but Reaper's just too dang S T R O N K in this meta and in Overwatch in general currently in my view. I think she might potentially need a buff of some sort to make her more of a utility like with her shield or maybe even her passive, but thank you very much nonetheless for your advice!
