depression,exg18aj,t1_exfvrhp,1566253130.0,I’ve never tried any real treatment. The most I’ve ever done to help is to try to talk to people but that has never done much.
depression,exe0d0x,t3_cs9uya,1566192982.0,I’ve been depressed since around 7 or 8 years old and now I’m 16 n most of my friends have admitted to be depressed at some point so I think it is normal. I am still stuck in depression myself so I don’t know anything to help you but I wish you luck.
