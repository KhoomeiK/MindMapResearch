AmItheAsshole,fqsrxj9,t1_fqsr9pr,1589616727.0,"My husband was hospitalized twice for his erratic behavior when he was a teenager. He was bullied mercilessly for years because the kids wanted to see him blow up and get in trouble. His mom had her own chair at the principal's office. He was misdiagnosed for almost a decade and was on a heck ton of unnecessary medication (they would medicate the side effects which would cause more side effects so more meds).

When he was a junior in high school, he realized that he could slow down his reactions and control his behavior. He graduated top of his class, went to college, he's now got a very good job. He managed to marry me despite never dating anyone before me. And we had a baby a few months ago. 

Now, his only autistic symptoms are looking at people for too long and organizing our firewood by size (down to the last stick). He's crazy and I love him. 

You need to seriously consider why you love your partner. And would he be the same person you love without autism? I know my husband wouldn't be. He would probably lose his ability to concentrate and visualize. He would also stop being as passionate about issues. He would also lose his intense loyalty. Because of his autism, he is a student of emotion. He is always trying to learn more about how people react to things, always trying to learn how better to approach situations. He would also lose the 15 years he spent in therapy learning coping mechanisms."

Autism is a part of your partner. He can't change that. 

My husband is autistic. He had a rough childhood. Very angry. But if our children are autistic, we will be better equipped. We have 20 more years of scientific research and therapy development than his parents did.
