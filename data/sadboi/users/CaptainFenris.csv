He needs to see a doctor and/or a therapist, and if he refused, there's not much you can do. And if he won't make steps to fix things in his life, you're probably better off just leaving. I know that sounds harsh, but if he's using you as a crutch to avoid dealing with his mental health, you're doing more harm than good by sticking around, and it's most certainly not good for your mental health either.
