On Genesis. Is it Genesis 3:15? It's a messianic prophesy, and what's wrong with that?

Genesis was made fun of by most critiques since I was little, but I am surprised at how science only catches up with it. Earlier, around 2010, there was a publication that said that scientists were wrong in saying that all creatures evolved from sea animals. It said that evolution occurred from both land and sea. If you look closely at genesis, we can see how some creatures were created from the sea, and the rest from the land. And in how now scientists agree there was a lot of incest ( which I believe wasn't a sin at the time), in the beginning. And in how scientists don't claim we evolved from apes anymore, but consider them distant relatives. Boy! I could go on, ( Eve as the single mother of humankind, creation of earth, moon and sun...) about how many times 'science' changed its mind.

Don't worry, I am all for science, and I have had my days of doubts. But, if Genesis isn't accurate for you, so isn't science.  I think we can agree on that.

I think you also don't understand what I meant with Gravity, because Gravity can't be proved and it's only in theory. I'll leave a link to John Lennox lectures  and discussion on the science of gravity and faith in God. [https://youtu.be/l63-fkyDtOc](https://youtu.be/l63-fkyDtOc) [https://youtu.be/Tr3ghb6JG6A](https://youtu.be/Tr3ghb6JG6A)

Here's a link also to J. Wallace's dating of the Gospels -[https://youtu.be/9CUVjg888m0](https://youtu.be/9CUVjg888m0)

\>Daniel doesn't appear in OT cannon until sometime between 180 B.C. and the middle of the second century. It's accurate about the events of Antiochus IV's conquest up until it tries to predict his death, and gets it completely wrong. Some of the events it predicts happened before it was written, and it failed miserably at guessing what would happen afterward.

This contention can be answered by simply looking at whether every bible scholar agree that Antiochus IV is the little horn mentioned. [https://1844madesimple.org/why-antiochus-iv-is-not-the-little-horn-of-daniel-8](https://1844madesimple.org/why-antiochus-iv-is-not-the-little-horn-of-daniel-8)

And, here's a little piece on why skeptics think the contrary, and why it cannot be proven:  ""Specific predictive prophecies, however, present a far greater problem  for the skeptic. This is why the date of Daniel is so hotly contested.  The critic alleges that Daniel must fit within the early second century  B.C. and not within the time period in which the book places itself: the  late sixth century B.C. They argue that this is the case simply because  the characters and events represented as belonging to the sixth century  are vague and the details allegedly erroneous, while descriptions of  the late third and early second century B.C. are specific and accurate.  In other words, Daniel claims not merely to assert generic predictions  which could find “fulfillment” in any creative rereading. Rather, **with the highest degree of accuracy**,  Daniel wrote about imperial successions (Daniel 2,7) and complicated  dynastic intermarriages (Daniel 10-11), growing increasingly specific  the further he moved from his own day. And he was correct about details  that confuse even modern historians. The skeptic alleges: “This just cannot be!” ""

This and your point on deciding the accuracy of prophesies:

>Give a specific time frame in which the prophecy is going to take place. ""Nation \[X\] will dissolve"" is a bad one. It's unfalsifiable, and probably going to happen if you wait long enough.

How many other prophesies have you seen that people ""most obviously"" predicted and came true?

You were saying somewhere else about Israel's reinstatement being such an obvious conclusion. Hello... The people that claimed this might have missed a lot of history. The major historians or prominent political figures had even remotely given ear to the speculation that Israel would be reinstated as a nation after what happened with them for over a century. 

In your earlier reply, you also say they were the largest religion on earth? The Jewish religion? That the Jews would allow such a thing as destruction of their centuries old relic and prestige of a temple, just to make themselves right? So, you're wrong on two strikes there. What are you talking about here?And the destruction of the temple didn't even happen when Christianity was powerful, but when the Romans were.

Yes, this isn't something I'm contesting.

This is yet another reason I doubt you lived as a true christian because if you so much as read the gospels, you would know this. So please don't trust on your mom's memories after she goes to heaven for your salvation. Because, heaven is a place with no worry, and no one is going to worry no more about you, but her prayers here, and your life here on earth will determine where you go.

Have you read what Jesus himself tells about the rich man and Lazarus? There's no turning back, my friend. If there was, there was no reason for God himself to come live a lowly, yet tested life on earth and die for all of mankind's sin a grievous death, and then rise again to defeat the devil. It was his promise, the promise which was and is the hope for Israel and all nations before and after Christ."

Majority opinion doesn't mean the most accurate opinion. There are more and more scholars each day that disagree with this dating. One, because Luke and Acts, which are dated in the 50s are drawing quotations from Mark. Mark can now be said to be written as early as AD 40. So there''s no surety on that. Besides historical dating evidences, authors like J. Warner Wallace have established that the accounts credibility and its importance in dating the gospels. Check them out.

Please elucidate on this. 

>I'm obviously not familiar with everything the man has written, but I seriously doubt he's privately recanted every single one of his positions

Now I'll call this a weaker statement, if you can at all establish that mine was weak. You should not be quoting around authors who have lost their credibility. You should be aware of their statements before quoting from them. Ehrman wrote an entire book trying to disprove christianity, and atheists are still drawing information from this flawed source.
 
You may have other sources, even christian, but we have already talked about how the opinions are changing. 
<which is something you haven't cared to address
What haven't I addressed? About Isaiah? I already said that a prophet isn't a historian, neither is he obligated to prophesy anything that does not affect his subject. Besides, which other prophesies have come half as close to being fulfilled as biblical prophesies?

>Again, the source of a claim has nothing to do with that claim's truth value. But lemme flip that around: are you saying I should get all my points about the Bible from Christian sources? 

Nah, ah... It does. Credibility of your sources will determine its truth value. And I don't say that. I was criticizing you  for drawing from sources lacking credibility, like I mentioned before on Ehrman, and Wikipedia. But, otherwise I am addressing them. 

> How? I just told you about my own experience. Surely you're not trying to say that your own experience is more valid than mine

Yeah I can. Because for one, I have experienced those experiences you have mentioned as similar to the holy spirit, and I can say that they haven't compared to the real experiences. While, two, your experience isn't what is held as the experience of the holy spirit, within the christian community. 
I highly doubt how much of a christian you said you were, because you seem to have no idea what the experience of the Holy Spirit is.

No, Daniel was written in 530 BC and Alexander reigned in around 365 BC.

You seem to get your points from Bart ehrman since those were his arguments. Which he, again... Retrieved! In a cowardly manner, in a private publication. So how can I go on repeating this same thing when you take your points from similar atheistic sources, and Wikipedia! 
I have tried to do answer these points without going into lengths because the sheer amount of misinformation is a little daunting. 

Our other discussion was about the spiritual experience. Jesus says, ""I stand at the door, and knock. If anyone answers, I will go in with him and 'sup with him."" 

Acts 17: 30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent.

For there comes a day of judgement irrespective of whether you believe in it. 

Your explanations for bad guys escaping just falls flat on how unjust it is that the good man and the rapist all ends up dead with no real justice. But there is One who is just, as much as he is Benevolent. Putting God in a box to suite our likes and dislikes restricts him from who he really is. And your experience with the ""holy spirit"" as you say, just tells me how much you underestimate Him.

Edit:One thing I've not addressed is the Muslim experience. Erm... Have you looked at the Qur'an? 
But I've heard of New Agers and Mormons experiencing spiritual things. But, I've come to realize that they have evil origins, and also think about how evil has power too, in this wicked world. These are immense theological concepts, that I dared not take up with an unbeliever. But the Bible says after the fall of human beings, we are separate from God. 

This is why we cannot experience God as easily as Adam and Eve, where they took walks in the garden. Sin cannot stand in the face of God's glory, so now we're left to see the greatest evidence -Jesus. Believe in his sacrifice for our sins to reunite us with God, whilst having the option to believe the lies of the devil. 

He's given us the Bible, he's commissioned his followers as missionaries, he's spreading the word, day and night. He's kept people who don't gain a dime to spend their lives to spread the gospel. For eg, you may have noticed I don't get anything from you here. Man is flawed in that you may find plenty of wolves in sheep clothing, or even sheep who fall many times. But, God will look at one person who will follow his righteousness, and Jesus would still die for that one person who seeks Him. 

I would highly encourage you to take a look at the new testament, and of course the OT after that (because your answer is quicker to find in the NT), once again. You should definitely not come with any prejudices for or against Christianity. And, this time with a genuine heart to seek God, with all your heart. 

Most people have found God when they read the Bible with a different and fresh mind. Let the blinds from the devil be taken off your eyes this time. This is my prayer."
TrueChristian,fqzyyht,t1_fqp85m2,1589779000.0,"This is becoming problematic to me because I don't agree nor can see the logic of any of your arguments. Again, I feel like this a waste of time trying to convince someone, who for one, still doesn't quite understand prophesy, second have a disdain for the books of the bible. 

Just when I start you say it's absurd to look to Genesis. How is it? Genesis is the most awe inspiring book that's been ridiculed so much, but have come to become right on the money with it's accuracy. 
And in Daniel, you're cribbing about Daniel not writing about something while that is not the duty of the prophet to record history. He records things significant to the events and people of the bible. 
I really can't go on with this. And, I cringe with disagreement all through out, I just don't want this to be just taken personally, if I go on to talk more. 
I wish and pray that someday God opens your heart and mind. It's vain to argue on intellectual things, when it's happening on different spheres. 

And on the Holy Spirit thingy, that's not even close to what you would experience. It's such a shame to equate it to things you have mentioned. Again, I've not come from a bubble to say I haven't had experiences in the world that can be more relatable, but still can't come near it. 

To answer quickly, to some of your claims. No, heaven and hell cannot be subjective. A things existence don't subjective on someone's belief on it. Like gravity. You say proof somewhere else, look up and you'll see there's no evidential proof for gravity. Don't you believe in it?

Hey, I'm really trying to give you a decent reply, but there's too many things we disagree on and it seems futile. Plus might just ruin any ground or friendship we have until now.

I know this probably sounds crazy to you now, but just keep in mind that a lot of Christianity sounds that way to me, too. My mom is a Christian. If there's a heaven (or renewed Earth, whichever you believe), how will she get there? I'm certainly not going there, and my mom wouldn't be happy without me. Does God rip me out of my mom's brain?

If you read the new testament you'll know there are no such ties in heaven. While she is on earth, she can care about you. Her prayers will definitely work. 

In conclusion, what I say might sound absurd to you, and vice versa. But I really appreciate that you're not totally avoiding the topic, and doing your research. In the end, I know that conversion for people doesn't happen with just getting answers, though that is included in the package. 

I'm still really sure about your conversion, because for one, Jesus promised that 'you and your household will be saved'. You say you don't understand salvation. It's really simple, but like I said you need your spiritual eyes opened.

I want to point out that the purpose of my first comment wasn't to show that Isaiah 7:14 cannot be interpreted about Jesus. However, the OP in this thread seemed to want to use prophecy as a line of evidence for Christianity. To that end, I tried to show that a natural reading of 7:14 without any Christian theology already taken along with you doesn't lead to a plausible interpretation about Jesus. One of my other interlocutors sent me this link to a Christian interpretation of this part of Isaiah, and I broadly agree with most of what the author says. 

I got what you said about not taking prophesies as a reliable evidence for Christianity. But I disagree because even if you try to disprove isaiah 7:14, you still have 400 prophesies, of which  fulfilled prophesies, and about 55-200 prophesied fulfilled and more to be. 
Other than about Jesus, have you gone through Daniel prophesies about Alexander the great, and his kingdom getting divided into four, and then two, after which Israel would be out of bondage? Again, about the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, the reinstatement of the nation of Israel when the best experts predicted that it would be impossible?

There are too many prophesies in the bible already fulfilled about many things that even you choose to not believe in half of them, you'll have to find a good explanation (solid) for the rest of them. The one things that baffles non-believers. So I again disagree about prophesies and it's ineffectiveness in proving the bible of Christianity. 

>I wish I shared your confidence. But it's been almost nine years of silence now, and the more I learn about Christianity, the less it makes sense to me. I honestly don't know what it would take to convince me.

First of all you have to understand that God isn't a genie. It's not about God being just a benevolent benefactor in heaven. Jesus says, that if a man gains the whole world, and loses his soul, what good is it? 

Luke 9:15For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?

God's most important need and purpose for humanity is not to live in this fallen sinful world, but in heaven, our eternal home. So, if I, a devout Christian keeps asking for a mansion, or good health without ever considering saving my soul, and if God fulfills it, what message does it give?  

Because Jesus again says, 

Mark 9: 47 If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell, 48 where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.

He values that we enter into heaven and be sinless, for which he left his heavenly glory to dwell among humans, as a 'fallen ' human. Not even the glorious creatures he made us in Eden. That's how much he loved us. That's the understanding we need. 

Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you. 

We're not trying to achieve Nirvana or bliss by living in exile, but Jesus give us life, freedom from spiritual death and sin, so that we don't have to suffer in the flesh. Because the whole world is under the influence of Satan, which we gave up when we fell for his deception. We think we'd be better than eve and Adam, but we still choose death over life. It's the simple belief in Christ that makes us sinless, and citizens of heaven. 
Now you may say, that heaven and hell are just constructs of religion, but then you need to answer about what happens to us after death. If the hardest criminal and the innocent kid all ends up in Oblivion, this is a pretty shi** life. Then why do so many of us search for truth. What's the login in believing that everything came from nothing? And if all goes to nothing? How do you account for energy?  

You said you experienced the holy spirit. How do you say so if you don't believe in it? Have you tried the same placebo by calling on a toothbrush? Or another god? I've seen across forums people having terrible sleep experiences calling on the name of Jesus to get out of it. Yet, they don't believe in Him. Even when Jesus did the miracles around the disciples they refused to believe on him. This is why I said you need your spiritual eyes opened. 

And if you did call out on God, what's your priority. Is it your soul? How many times have I experienced God's protection over my life even when I wasn't with him. We never realize or give God glory for that. We leave it all to coincidence and chance. Well, something should happen that will make us absolutely sure that's not chance. I've had it ,and so has everyone who is so sure in their faith. I have nothing to gain, and haven't gained anything materialistic from coming to Christ. But he has kept me and showed me the way, and filled me with peace and love , and freedom from fear, etc etc ..I though I'd never be capable of by myself .. (EDIT: he does provide for our material things on Earth too, but that's not his priority nor is it the important thing for us. Because you look at the richest people who are lost souls. I'm not explaining here, I think you have though about all this. If you wanna talk more about it, let us. Im not claiming to know everything, but I'm sharing what I've come to know from humbling myself and asking God for explanation. He always gives and answer to me. But only if you're connected to him,. Remember how I said he's not a genie? He is personable with a personality. Don't treat him like some being obligated to make us all live a better earthly life. In short, don't put God in a box)

You can experience it too, but if you can't recognize or accept God's sacrifice of himself for us, while we were yet enemies of Him, so that we may be saved, that's the biggest failure. That's all there is to life. No one can convince you, but you can keep searching. God is always hearing .There is nothing hidden from him. We may not understand every whys, but if you ask, he'll help you understand. God is real. Jesus is real and alive.

I really cannot dissect why you were not able to hear from God myself.We still disagree on the prophecies because prophesies are a very vital part of what the apostles heralded as their anchor for belief. And the Bible has prophecies not written prophesy over them in plain letters obviously, but in cryptic manners all over it. It's been one of the most trusted liturgical pieces for centuries now. In your reply to me, they went on about how virgin should be interpreted. There's plenty of gaps for disagreement there. . You must look at other verses of prophesies too. They are meddled in prayers of David in psalms, or dreams of Daniel, or between the laws of Moses. 

As for hearing from God, I'm sure you will. If you searched for God and if you have no emotional reservations about it. God will definitely make sense to you one day. And believe me he hears you. I was a de-convert and then reconvert  myself. I know it takes a spiritual eye openin for that to happen, too ( it says in the gospels). I'll keep you in prayers for that, because I believe in prayer. And, give reading the gospels another chance. I am so sure in my beliefs for many reasons and one of which is how there's no other way things happened and still keeps happening to me,  with Jesus. It was a one-way relationship for me with Him before that.  I also didn't have myself rooted in the Word. This world is under the influence of the devil, and it's easy for him to deceive us. But God is more powerful to rescue us. But, we need to have the heart for it. I'm trying to make my reply as comprehensible as possible. But, forgive me if it's too jumbled.

You see, we are like blocks of stone out of which the Sculptor carves the forms of men. The blows of His chisel, which hurt us so much are what make us perfect.""

C. S. Lewis (1898-1963)"
TrueChristian,fqghxje,t3_gimoam,1589346729.0,"Hi sister, I felt I should reply to you. It strikes me as though you might have some unresolved emotional stress or hurt hidden beneath all this. How is your relationship with your mother? No one can come to this state you are, with just religious confusion. Coming to Christ is the only way you can search the depths of your soul to find out what's causing you so much mental stress. He reveals, before He resolves. 

You are similar to me, I'm 27 and I have these thoughts about getting old too. But we underestimate God too much. We think he doesn't care about us. 4 years is a long time. But God can solve things for you within a few months. But first you need to be ROOTED in Christ. 

This verse was very helpful to me when I decided to leave all and stop sinning at 26. God showed me that He will give me everything once I lay my foundation in Him and give myself to him and knowing Him completely first. 

Matthew6:33
31 Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’ 32 For the Gentiles(unbelievers) eagerly seek all these things;

 for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 
**33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.**

Remember that all his disciples struggled with unbelief even when he worked great miracles in front of them.

 Open up your heart to Jesus. Go to a room, shut the door, and sit there till you're able to get everything out from your heart to our Father in heaven. Until you can hear and feel him in your heart and put your trust in Him. Praise Him. He'll soon confirm things to you, thorough someone or something. 

God will never forsake those that seek him. All of us have fallen, but we only trust in His sacrifice for us. 

Edit: have you started reading the Bible? If not, make it your highlight of the day, with prayer. It's the bread of our life and soul."

It's clear we disagree, you don't have to assert that every time someone turns from atheism.

Are you completely free of strife, envy, rage and, factions, disputes, dissentions? Fornication/immorality and lasciviousness/sensuality are mentioned in the same sentence. 
If you fall in any of those, you are equally in bondage of sin as the other person. And if you say, you don't, you're doing that right now? 
We live by grace, and not works. Give Corinthians a read again, if you have doubt there. We need his forgiveness and grace a lot! And we are all sinners. We can never become PERFECT, and then accept Jesus'forgiveness. 
He accepts us as we are. Otherwise, none of us would be on His kingdom.

And yes, repentance means not doing the sin again! So OP needs to hear that. Just because we are under grace, doesn't mean we keep sinning. That's NOT repentance!
 But if there's a struggle there, the Bible mentions that you must flee sin, and you'll be able to flee it. It's not making excises to Sin. So, there's a line to be drawn from both sides according to the Bible."

He talks about how we should abide in Him, the true Vine as its branches in John 14 and 15.
Though it's tough, it also helps to stay away from too much media or other worldly distractions. It maybe especially hard for a young person. 

I'll tell you of one instance where God helped me with my addiction to cell phone and TV shows. I'm a fan of friends and was so drawn to rewatching it, it was filling up my day, and drawing me away from spending time with him. I prayed that I'm not able to resist the attraction. Soon, I was able to count it nothing. Satan attracts us away from God through people and things. 
We need to recognise his tricks. As it says in Ephesians 6. Our fight is not against flesh and blood. But, spiritual forces. So, count people as merely instruments of either God or Satan. And grow in his word and spirit, abiding in Jesus. We can win this race! 

Have a blessed blessed week and life! God is raising up witnesses for him, and it's time for a reawakening. We have greater things awaiting in Heaven, our True Home."
TrueChristian,fpqjdim,t1_fpngcfo,1588824163.0,"Yes, someone who's more in touch with the holy spirit can hear from God and God can speak through them. 
That's why Jesus promised us the holy spirit. Remember how God used even a donkey to speak to a baalam(?) 

People who live their lives subject to God always without involving in world's lists and leading a pure life has the Spirit dwelling in them in greater measure. 

You can achieve it too, by dedicating your life to Jesus, completely. And learning to listen to the light pulls of the spirit in your hear telling you not to do sins, or telling you to spend time praying, or reading the Bible. Like it says in Jeremiah you get filled by the spirit by measure (except for to Jesus Christ). Look at the apostles journey too to understand."

As it says in Romans 5

8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 

And, as it says in John 15

13 Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. 14 You are My friends if you do what I command you. 15 No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. 16 You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. 17 This I command you, that you love one another"

Everyday, talk to Jesus. Let him know your needs. You'll be surprised at the things that will happen in your life. 

Jesus warned that the world will hate you, but he also promised that you'll endure because he is with you ""always. Even unto the end of the world"".

Edit: I didn't mean to say that church is not important. But that being a follower of Christ begins with a relationship with Him! 

And when I said He'll fulfill your needs, it means that you'll find a good fellowship for yourself, too. 

Fellowship is very very important in a Christian Life, but just being integrated into a church will not make you a Christian. That's all I meant.
