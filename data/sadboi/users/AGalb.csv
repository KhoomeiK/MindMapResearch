bipolar,fctuvp1,t3_eitr9w,1577960755.0,That is so good!!
bipolar,f3yr5nw,t3_diun4v,1571258229.0,Yeah sertraline was not great for me. Speak to your Dr asap.
BipolarReddit,f1dxq1v,t3_d8vbem,1569404778.0,"This sucks, I'm sorry. Things like this are what keep leading me to postpone psych appointments. I feel like once I'm officially diagnosed then work may be able to use it against me. I wish I'd never told them my GP suspected it in the first place. I'm already going to have to drop out of my graduate scheme because they are convinced that I'm too ill to cope despite the fact that a bit of time off has left me feeling the most stable in about 10 years."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f13kpbd,t1_f0xkbo8,1569161686.0,Sounds like a petit mal seizure. If it always happens in that same place could the light in there be triggering it (lightbulb flickering so quickly it isn't discernable to the eye perhaps) or a weird pattern on the walls or a picture?
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f13iypk,t3_d7ebis,1569161040.0,Worth chatting to your doctor just incase your bipolar 2 has tipped into bipolar 1 which can cause these sorts of experiences. It's not uncommon for this to happen with bipolar. Either way it's a weird experience for sure!!
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f13gvxa,t3_d7mtgs,1569160260.0,I've been through the end of a relationship where I didn't think I'd survive it. But I did and I am so glad I did. Give it some time. Keep busy researching glitches if you need to.
illnessfakers,eyyp3wj,t1_eyyp2mv,1567597414.0,"That's interesting, thanks!"
illnessfakers,eyynoz6,t3_czj1l7,1567595965.0,"Non epileptic seizures are a thing. People can have several small ones in short succession and be ok pretty soon afterwards. Maybe a bit shaky but nothing that can't be managed by chilling out for a bit. They can vary person to person and even incident to incident so dramatically that it probably isn't even worth thinking about this.

ETA: non-epileptic seizures are often psychological in origin, so it wouldn't be out of the realms of possibility for a munchie to develop them."
illnessfakers,eyym4ui,t3_cz9e4g,1567594201.0,Sometimes it is worse to sit still for long periods of time than it is to move about with chronic issues. ðŸ¤·
endometriosis,ev531qv,t1_ev510bo,1564226644.0,Thinx underwear are my saviour!!
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ev4yuof,t3_cidru3,1564224273.0,I'd suggest speaking to your doctor about this just in case. Best to be able to tick off hallucinations etc definitively as your starting point.
endometriosis,ev4yci8,t1_ev45p88,1564223962.0,Oh!! I can get through a super tampon in 2 hours.  This has given me some perspective thanks.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ettw0sx,t1_ettvt9s,1563197692.0,If you mean me I wasn't on any meds at the time..
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,etttupg,t1_etttqs3,1563195824.0,I've seen shadowy creatures when manic in the past. Only happens in mania for me. ðŸ¤·
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ettswmi,t3_cdgnvn,1563194966.0,Personally I call them bipolar disorder. YMMV of course.
raisedbynarcissists,etr5e83,t1_etr057b,1563112790.0,"Agree here too. You are probably average and this is just an N game to keep you insecure. But if not, you can still be good in bed by being generous, paying attention to your partner's needs and their responses. If you do that you'll probably be miles ahead of most other men in my experience."
bipolar,etr4ppl,t3_cd20q7,1563112280.0,"Doing as little as possible. I've been ill for days but a bit hypomanic and running around trying to do stuff. Today I will chill out, read a book and eat some healthy food. 

Harder than it sounds with BP sometimes though right? I've already caught myself trying to deep clean the coffee machine and sorting a drawer ðŸ˜‚"
MaliciousCompliance,ertk9ll,t3_c3vvce,1561244832.0,Can confirm this is true. I was a Dalek hanging out nearby when this happened.
Sims4,ertjpbz,t3_c3v391,1561244360.0,I now want to do nothing more than put 66 pears on my toddler's inventory.
RBI,ertj8i8,t3_c3vn9w,1561243983.0,"Yeah as others have said, some smoke alarms have mains backup and will continue to beep until you put new batteries in. I learned this the hard, sleep deprived way."
bipolar,ereslvy,t3_c1pojs,1560791900.0,I'm in the UK. I've been waiting 3 months so far.
HydroHomies,er6nrnv,t3_c0nfyq,1560552108.0,Such needless slaughter.
