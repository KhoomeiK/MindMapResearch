lexington,fgq897g,t1_fgq4o5x,1581019706.0,"yeah, but that’s like asking someone to make you a better cheeseburger because you might eat it... but you are not even eating the ones that are already there.  it’s not practical to make huge investments in technology like that on the pretense that some community members say that they will use it and only a small fraction of our population definitely would use it

you are also asking a mid-sized city in an impoverished state to fund a billion-dollar investment in one community with a huge margin  between those dependent on public transit and those who are not (if the city’s economy was suffering because of public transit, they’d fix it - but people in this town buy cars or carpool, make it to work and continue to invest in the community - so why fix what isn’t broken?). no one (on this thread at least) is saying, “i can’t get somewhere because the transit sucks,” they are making criticisms on an ill-funded resource in our city and saying if they made it better, i’d probably use it. 

sure, we have a traffic problem in lexington but there are cheaper, more practical options for solving that problem - and a large scale public transit overhaul for a subset of our population just isn’t going to happen and doesn’t make sense.

lexington,fgpfr85,t3_ezjpub,1581003915.0,"to all of the people suggesting light rail systems - LOL. 

we don’t have any where near the population size to take on such a massive overhaul of our transit system. maybe we could justify a new street car system, but Norfolk, VA is the smallest city with an actual rail service in america and it serves over 1.4 M people annually with average daily weekday boardings of 4,600 people. 

so, the idea that even a fraction of that many people would use that system in Lexington is simple being naive.  i think the user who points a triangular rail system between Cincy, Louisville and Lexington is on to something... but an inner-city rail system in Lexington, KY is simply stupid when a very small fraction of our population currently use our public transit. 

note the next smallest city with a rail system after Norfolk is Cleveland, serving 1.6 M annually. 

lastly, i’ll just say that i think, as much as it sucks, we need to keep financing road work and infrastructural change.  we need to sell off our large yards, empty lots and parking lots and start building up and not out. part of our problem is that we are trying to build a city that feels like a suburb. everyone wants their cake and to eat it too. if we want to function like a metropolis, we have to build a metropolis.  that’s how we will serve our people."

kentucky is still very rural and very conservative but the metro areas are growing progressively more liberal and the hope is that they can oust mcconnell in ANY election.  it’s been an uphill battle and we only recently unseated bevin and mainly because we were riding on the coattails of beshear’s legacy in the form of his son: andy.

introvert,fekpwcz,t3_epkyf7,1579205154.0,"not trying to be the dickhead on this thread, but it sounds like you are fishing for affirmation and you are frustrated that you are being affirmed. 

why are you being so self-referential? why are you giving yourself the label of “awkward”? if you are saying it, then why wouldn’t others feel comfortable to affirm your words? if you believe it and express it (even in a joking manner), that gives them permission to believe and express it too.  even if it’s kind of a douche move. 

if it’s outward projection of your introversion, it could be that you haven’t come to fully accept yourself as an introvert - which comes with seemingly impossible social barriers (that aren’t impossible, just harder for us than other folks). 

lastly, you are in high school. it’s a hard, emotional time for everyone and no one is nice to anyone. it sucks and i’m sorry you are going through it - but understand that self-love and self-acceptance is crucial to combatting nasty people and will be far beyond high school. many of your peers will grow up and get a perspective but there will ALWAYS be people who don’t.

introvert,fek71n2,t3_epl2i3,1579193948.0,"i am an introvert and have been in a 10 year relationship with many ups and downs concerning our sex life (mainly brought on by me).  i would hesitate to say that my introversion is linked to my sex drive but there are definitely situations where in, even if i am comfortable, i do not want to have sex because i need time to myself. 

unfortunately, this can manifest into a “you control when we have sex” type situation and it sucks but the silver lining is that it’s never been an issue of attraction or desire. sometimes, as an introvert, you need to be by yourself and the act of sex, in my eyes, is a sacrifice of personal space which i struggle with as an introvert. 

all of that being said, i don’t want to pass judgement on your situation to quickly but it appears as if you are insinuating that you are frustrated by your partner’s low sex drive and are trying to find a way to combat that. let me warn you of two things: 1) other commenters are correct that we are not a hive mind and the desire to abstain from intimacy is not directly linked to our introversion; and 2) looking for ways to get what you want from others in a relationship despite their reservations and without talking with them directly might result in exactly what you have stated having: a ONE year relationship. 

take it from me: communication is everything, and presumption is the absence of communication."
