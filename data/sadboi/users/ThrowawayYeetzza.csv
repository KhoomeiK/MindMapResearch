As a businessman, he knows how to convince people to do things without them realizing that he's doing it. While I do not agree with most of the things he does, it is amazing how he can make a typo and then keep the lie going and draw on a weather map (which is illegal) and then turn all of that into selling his own sharpies that benefit his campaign"

He tries to buy a country then cancels his trip when they say no. He makes a lot of spelling mistakes or mistakes when speaking but doesn't own up to them, it's always the media's fault or the teleprompter glitched.

He also pulls ""facts"" out of his ass, like when he said that windmills: cause cancer, lower your house's value by 75% and kills birds. That's just one example. There are plenty more."
