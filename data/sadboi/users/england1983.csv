SuicideWatch,foun2q7,t1_fotxtgz,1588087038.0,Same. I'm just worried about my family that's why I dont do it
BeardedDragons,foujdlz,t3_g9ct0j,1588085149.0,Update: she did go stiff now and wont do anything no matter how she is moved and she is very cold so she is dead. Its very sad :(
BeardedDragons,fosrr52,t1_fosp1kf,1588036694.0,I moved her around quite a bit and she has not moved for a few hours. I think her mouth and nose were underwater but I cant quite remember. I'm just worried she is still alive because she isn't still so I'm paranoid I will bury her alive
BeardedDragons,fosmo9t,t3_g9ct0j,1588033744.0,I also lifted her up and swayed her around a bit with no response and she was going to lay eggs so idk if it's still possible she went into brumation but her colour has changed and she is VERY bloated in the stomach. She did try and lay before and tried maybe last week so she might have been egg bound. She also hadn't eaten in a while

SuicideWatch,foco1rl,t3_g6qx7q,1587673657.0,"I've seen some horrible videos on the internet too, it's a horrible place and I know that it can scar you. I've seen a lot of animal abuse and animal killing videos by accident and I think about them a lot but the fact that you reported them was good, someone needs to but it's not up to just you to do it and it can be hard to watch, that's why there are professionals for that sort of thing. You did the right thing"

Christianity,fo5jecn,t3_g5iojx,1587527097.0,"I am ashamed of Trump as a Christian. I dont think he spreads love and kindness at all. I dont think he loves everyone, I dont think he loves people different from himself, the poor, the disabled, people of different religions, the disabled ect... 
Side note too: although I would vote for someone whose values are similar to mine (obviously Christian) I don't think religion should be mixed in with politics at all as there is freedom of religion and not everyone is a Christian and we shouldn't force people in our country to follow our values or religion"
SuicideWatch,fn7mx7g,t3_fzu0jt,1586723527.0,Are you aware of sexual obsessions with having OCD? A lot of the time you never want to harm a child or do anything sexual with a child but because you have an impulsive thought about it that you give attention it can make a lot of people scared that they are a paedophile or that they will harm a child. This might he the case and although it will cost you money I would reccomend seeing a therapist first before making harsh decisions!

acting,fmu21cy,t1_fmu11k0,1586383106.0,"I'm not really too sure about that but I dont think so. It is good to go for as many auditions as possible for experience and as long as you can play guitar (or whatever other skill) then it's not lying and you have met the description, however I'm still not completely sure and someone might correct me"
acting,fmu0f1f,t1_fmtxx8l,1586382270.0,"Yeah you should definitely still practice them if you know the basics and then you can put them down, it was just my opinion but I hope it helps!"
acting,fmtvg3x,t1_fms0wra,1586379702.0,"Think about what role it might land you. If they're looking for someone to play a character that dances and plays the guitar, would you manage to do that role? If yes, put it down, if no, don't because it may land you an audition but if they ask about it in the audition and you cant do it you probably wont get the role"
