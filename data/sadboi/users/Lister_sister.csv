I have taken the survey and will share it with a few people I know. 

Did you try posting on FB group? I know there are a few, I'm not in them because it feels less secure, but perhaps you should try."

ptsd,ewbhazk,t1_ewbdvwa,1565266443.0,"Hi, thanks for sharing this.   
It's really interesting. I looked into the insights, there was one about effectiveness before and after treatment. People reported effective treatments, but how do I find what treatments were beneficial? 

Thanks"
