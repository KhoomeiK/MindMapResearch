Edit: she just told me she just asked the question and he laughed followed by the answer. She didn't specify why she thought it and only said she thought it because she is socially weird. I think it's strange he didn't ask her why she thought that.

I marinated 1,5 kilos of spareribs overnight with the following recipe:

- 2 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 4cm cube of ginger (minced)
- 2 teaspoons (or more) sambal oelek
- juice and peel of one lemon
- 8 tbsp soy sauce
- 4 tbsp ketjap Manis
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons honey

I put them in the slowcooker for 2 hours on high, then 4 hours on low. After that I made a glaze for the spareribs. I think I could've used much more so please double it or something for way better results. You can always choose to not put all the glaze on them.

- 4 tbsp ketjap Manis
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 4 tbsp of Sriracha (original recipe called for a little bit of chili sauce which will probably also taste great)
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- squeeze of lemon juice
- sambal oelek to taste

After glazing them I put them in the oven for 180°c for 15 minutes.
They fell apart when I took them out of the oven with my hand.

I got this recipe from a dutch recipe site but I don't know if I am allowed to link it."
