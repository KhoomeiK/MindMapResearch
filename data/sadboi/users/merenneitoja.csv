zoloft,fejfnob,t3_epbtqa,1579171930.0,"I quit sertraline at 100mg after taking it for a couple months, the withdrawals are pretty shitty. I'd recommend just talking to your doctor? It could be worth tapering off them instead of quitting cold turkey just for the sake of your mental health. It made my emotions super erratic when I stopped taking them, and generally made being alive uncomfortable  (brain zaps are no fun)"
BPD,fbehoxo,t3_ecezdi,1576785927.0,"Yes!! I feel like every time I spend more than an hour or 2 alone this starts happening? I've done this since I was a kid too, nice to know it's not just me lol"

PurplePillDebate,f7oxrrd,t3_dx6md8,1573937029.0,"I don't understand why ""real men"" are always thought of as balding, ugly, basement dwelling creeps in sub reddits like this? When people say they want portrayals of ""real men"" or ""real women"" they just mean they want an average, realistic looking person who isn't a 9/10-10/10 Mary Sue of a character, that doesn't necessarily mean ugly, overweight, creepy, and awful? Why is that thought of as the default ?"
fatlogic,f6lh28m,t1_f6lgn8k,1572944502.0,"? Selfish people I clearly identity with?
1. I'm just going to ignore the ""clearly identity"" part because just, eye roll, but yeah, that's an unfortunate situation for everyone, I agree that they should make bigger seats on planes or obese people should maybe have to purchase 2 seats or what not, but I don't understand how that's selfish. I'm not calling parents who bring kids on planes selfish even though that's significantly worse (kids kicking back of seat for hours while a baby screams, the joy of airplane rides). People are.. allowed to take public transportation? Whether it's a plane, a boat, or bus. If you can't handle the shitty parts of it maybe try buying a first class ticket next time
2. Ive sat next to overweight people on public transport before, it's not great, not comfortable, but I would not describe it as anything more than mild discomfort because.. thats what it is? Definitely not something to cry and be hysterical for 5 hours for, especially if you're an adult I mean Really? People made points that if someone is claustrophobic or have anxiety or ect ect that could effect how someone deals with it, but based purely off OPs post, that isn't the case"
fatlogic,f6l6j9p,t1_f6l65mx,1572930640.0,"? Yes, having someone being lightly pressed up against you is what I'd consider mild discomfort?"
fatlogic,f6k5q63,t1_f6k13s0,1572905508.0,"I think it's just generally rude for people to comment on someone's body, unless you're really close or know they're trying to lose weight or what not. 
 I'm generally a healthy weight, and when I gained 30 lbs (still in a healthy weight range), and then lost the 30 lbs from being depressed it was upsetting to hear people I say I looked good when it was weight loss directly stemming from how I feel like shit. 
It's not really a compliment when you aren't feeling or looking healthy"
fatlogic,f6hqj3k,t3_drc4ju,1572862499.0,Ok but crying for an entire 5 hour flight because you are mildly uncomfortable is a bit ridiculous
