I think she was high when shed hit on me and ask me out. I'm bi but I declined many times and it eventually got bad enough for me to ask someone we both got along with to talk to her. She felt really bad. She was twice my age and I wasn't into her personality. But I considered her a friend.

AskReddit,fjf951z,t3_fd5f1b,1583286929.0,"I guess when people would tell me I was less than others or that I deserved bad things.

I got teased by the Christian kids for my uncle committing suicide and how it meant he'd go to hell. Someone told me that I was lying about being raped because nobody would rape me.


All these things, upon reflection, had nothing to do with me personally. Society can be sick. But I don't hold grudges. I had some bad bullying in 6th grade when I went to a tiny new school. Everyone in one class for the whole grade. They all grew up together. I always found another outcast and cented with music and writing. And sadly cutting. I had one girl apologize out of the blue as an adult for the way she treated me. I respect that she felt and expressed guilt. It makes me think of the people I treated poorly. I guess I can understand her own actions because growing up can be confusing. We made mistakes."

He knows what we need to do and we're working on it. I kind of already talked about it and my other replies but we're working with his doctor's office and trying to get him and sooner on a waiting list there is an appointment that's not out till May. I know he can't wait that long so if we need to set him up with a new provider in a different facility.

It's a tough spot because I know what it's like to express things like that but not actually have a plan which he doesn't have a plan so that's reassuring. I mean in the past with people that have been many times where I've called hope they didn't want and because they didn't want to help nothing ended up happening until they were ready. But if I felt like he was actively going to attempt suicide there's no way I'd leave him alone or not reach out"

How about you could be a port disabled person of color that is transexual and uneducated. That makes me think of something though. I just realized you do face intersectionality okay.

AskReddit,fhicr9q,t1_fhicdkb,1581622214.0,This kind of reminds me how I meant to see a doctor for a lump in my breast and somehow he started asking me about my sexual history then he told me that I was committing adultery. I said I'm not cheating on my boyfriend we're just not married and we're not Christian so I don't know what you're saying so he argued with me about how people wouldn't know how to have more honest if it weren't for the Bible and I argued that there are lots of fables and stories with morals and other ways your parents can teach you right from wrong. Not believing in Jesus Christ doesn't mean you don't have a conscience. And then he called me a heathen. A f****** heathen. I really should have reported him but I was just too damn upset and lazy. A couple times I came into the ER for unrelated things and his immediate concern was always STDs and he even told me he thinks my boyfriend is cheating on me and giving me STDs before he got any results back. I had a routine typical regular old UTI nothing else. I got unnecessary shaming.
AskReddit,fhibsmu,t3_f39swl,1581621683.0,I just wanted to know what it felt like. I was a little disappointed that it was a cloudy day but I'm still happy.

I know how to swim in a lake and I grew up around water but the ocean is definitely something different and I didn't see it until I was 27
ptsd,fhib9rk,t1_fhhljzh,1581621386.0,My own boyfriend doubted me about some of the stories I told. If I even start to open up about it people look at me like I'm crazy. I was called crazy a lot. I don't know if I've ever even told the whole story. At this point I know I couldn't because it all got mangled up. It's like I tried to delete it and fragmented but now my brain keeps trying to put it all back together just store it away and it won't work. But I think in a way that's what keeps me from letting it destroy me. There's some things people just weren't meant to experience without losing something important. But a few people know a little bit more the nurse and just the little things they do know help them wrap their head around the idea that this man could have really done these things. But mostly get what you're saying about not being believed or being shamed and it taking responsibility. I have PTSD from a few things but I'm focusing on domestic violence and harassment and stalking. The rest of the violence that entails all kinds of violence. I can't even begin. It's so hard for even me to believe. Things get really hairy
