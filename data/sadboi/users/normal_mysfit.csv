talesfromcallcenters,fd16gft,t1_fcy78fs,1578127962.0,Sorry went with Christmas presents for a few coworkers. The call center I was at required to to get permission to come in on your day off and me and the ex thought nothing of it. Got there and was detained by security. That's when a manager came out and told me I was fired. Even the security staff who normally does it didn't want to do it. Never found out why I was fired because even though I wasn't the highest performer like my ex I got appointments set. My ex and I laughed and said at least I would be getting sleep now. I was working 2 full time jobs and averaged about 5 hours sleep.

TalesFromYourServer,fcu05i8,t1_fcscq37,1577967875.0,"Years ago my family and I went to a new restaurant to eat. I had just got off a 10 hour shift, my mom got off a 10 hour shift and my sister was pregnant with her 2nd child. He first was trying to be good but was getting antsy. We had been waiting a while when a group with a similar amount of people that came afterward got seated. I asked for the manager to she what was going on and got the assistant manager 
 I'm being polite but I tell her its asinine that someone that came after us sat before us. She agreed and said lets she 2hat we can do for you. She is moving us to the back and asks if we mind 2 booths, my mom looks next to the booths and awea a table big enough for us and asks about that. This is not a part I am proud of but the GM then shows up and declares that his staff has done enough for us for us cussing at them. I was a little astonished and asked him when, he said you said asinine.  I laughed and asked the man if he knew what it meant. He started to get in my face as much as a 5'6"" man can to a 6'4"" guy. I then proceeded to scare the shit out of him and then left the restaurant for Hooters. Had a much better experience. My sister complained and when she went back for her comp the GMs name was gone. The assistant gm was promoted."

I heard through the grapevine that he said I was sleeping on duty and he said something to my manager. I wasn't but guess who lost his ability to check in early.
