If not, research collective conscience ascending from 3D timeline.

Everything in the universe vibrates at a certain frequency.
They've cured cancer with 528hz apparently (you can listen to these frequencies on youtube)

Gaia (the universe/energy) has been working to push us all up to 5d -but she kicked everything into overdrive since last summer.
Lower vibrational timelines like 3d consist of hate/death/war/greed/selfishness -& those things can't exist in 5D.

I'm clairaudient, and didn't know until I started hearing high pitch frequencies/energies in about July after I had a massive interaction with what is I'm assuming my spirit guide.
I hear energies when they come near me, and my intuition frequency goes off in my left ear for no, and right ear for yes whenever I ask any questions, or when someone lies to me.

It's actually sort of annoying at times.
There are certain things I don't want to know the answer to and I'm told anyways. Lol.
