3D printing is a hobby I've wanted to get involved in for a while now, but with quarantine and social distancing, I'm bored enough that I'm going to make the jump. I'm looking for a machine that would be good for someone starting out. I've seen several from MakerBot and Creality that seem to fit the bill, but have also seen several on Amazon that are highly recommend (ex. QIDI Tech).

I'm looking for a machine that I can grow into as I delve into more complicated builds, so not necessarily limited to an entry-level machine. Any recommendations you can provide or experiences you can share are much appreciated.

100% serious about starting soon so I'll probably go with the most recommended machine here."
