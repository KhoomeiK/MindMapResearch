Meditation,fppqivd,t3_geuhck,1588807209.0,"The only reason I would avoid practicing this is that im open minded about the ""law of attraction"" which states that whatever you visualize and repeat to yourself consistently will EVENTUALLY become real. I've read and heard enough stories about people manifesting their visualizations into reality that I would caution you against visualizing anything negative especially if you're doing it repeatedly. Why not visualize all the positive things in your life and affirm that you're grateful for them ? 



I've been implementing metta meditation into my practice and I've noticed that it improves my mood a lot throughout the day. Visualizing family members, friends, strangers, and myself, and then repeating the phrase ""May you be happy. May you be free from suffering."" Etc. I visualize them laughing and having a great time. I visualized them in a happy relationship with kids by their side. And I then do the same for myself. Visualizing all my dreams come true. And I truly feel joy for others and myself. 

Then I start practicing gratitude by telling myself how grateful I am for having my family and friends in my life. Visualizing myself having a great time with them and all the things im blessed with like a home and warm food."

depression,fjxqzrm,t3_f2qwaw,1583681275.0,"Im going through the EXACT SAME THING. Depression can cause severe memory and attention problems. I constantly make mistakes at work. I easily forget things I read or heard. I find it hard to concentrate and stay focused whether it's a conversation im having or trying to follow instructions at work. 

Exercise is the only thing that has brought me consist relief from the bring fog and feeling like a ""slug."" But depression can make it so much more fucking difficult to just get up and go to the gym. when my depression is getting pretty bad, that's when I most NEED to go to the gym, but ironically that's the LAST thing I want to do. It takes a lot of will power to get out the door 

That's why I finally decided to take my therapists advice and take meds. I've tried to will power my way out of my deoression for far too long with no consistent improvement. It's always 1 step forward and 2 steps back because depression has a way of coming back with a vengeance and taking you back go square one. When you are really depressed you can't even think straight nor have the energy to do anything that will help you like going for a walk, or going out with friends, or going to the gym. Next thing you know it's  been 2 weeks you haven't left your room. Make a doctors appointment and tell them you want to see a therapist because of your symptoms. They'll help you out."

To make it into a habit, meditate every morning. At least 3 minutes. But it has to be everyday at the start so you can make it into a daily habit. 

Headspace is more fun imo. Great for begginers (im still a begginer btw) and what's great is they offer 3 and 5 minute meditations when you are in a hurry or don't feel like doing the longer ones. 

In conclusion, do it everyday. Work your way up to longer sessions. There will be days when you feel like you can't get yourself to sit for 10 min. THAT'S OK. Just do 3 minutes. Headspace is probably the most fun and best for begginers. They have a lot of variety but you do have to pay. Waking Up goes in more depth.

2. See a psychiatrist for meds. Nothing wrong with taking meds. Your social anxiety is crippling you 

3. Meditation (I use Waking Up app. There's a one week free trial. If you can't afford it then they will give yoy a subscription for FREE if you email them)

4. Pray to higher power everyday for strength to endure. (Make this into a habit)

5. Once you have been meditating for a few weeks. Begin to practice how to ACCEPT your social anxiety while it's happening. Don't try to fight it, accept it. Meditation will help in this regard. You'll feel tension. You'll feel your face getting red. You'll feel yourself sweating and unable to breath. Accept it. Tell yourself in your head ""ok, I accept"" ""I welcome my anxiety."" Because the funny thing is, when you start trying to fight your anxiety, it makes it worse.

Take meds. I've been struggling with anxiety for my whole life and im just now, at 22, accepting that medication might be the only way for me to consistently tolerate the anxiety I feel at work and social gatherings. You gotta do it dude. Nothing wrong with taking meds. FUCK what other people tell you. They don't know what it's like to have severe social anxiety. How debilitating and excruciatingly painful it is. Your parents might tell you it's not right, the internet will tell you this and that. FUCK it, every medication has side effects. People take meds for cancer right? Nobody goes ""oh don't take it, you just have to push through."" People don't realize how social anxiety can screw up your whole life. All your dreams and goals get squashed by this crippling phobia we have. Social anxiety can easily be as destructive as any other disease out there. Including cancer. Its just that the pain and effects aren't as noticeable on the outside. 

Do yourself a favor and see a medical provider. Don't procrastinate.

Start seeing a therapist if you don't already. Very important."

CBD,fhj47pm,t1_fhj1frc,1581637871.0,"Do a lot of research before you buy CBD for anxiety. 

I'll tell you one thing, and it's important...

Buy CBD oil that is called ""isolate CBD"" or ""THC-free CBD""

Do not buy ""full spectrum CBD""

Reason being that ""Isolate CBD"" does not contain any THC. THC can make your anxiety worse. For me it does. That's why I can't smoke weed, the THC spikes mg anxiety levels through the roof. So when you buy CBD, makes sure it is free of any THC. Every website sells these two types."

I decided to try intermittent fasting. I only eat two big meals one at 2pm and the other at 10pm  (due to my work schedule.) Get in about 1000 calories in each. Today is day 2 and it's EASY. Drinking black coffee and green tea gets me through the morning just fine. And when I eat  2 big meals, I don't have any desire to snack in between. So I've managed to go 2 days without eating any junk food and Im already feeling a little less tired throughout the day, probably because im not snacking on a bunch of sweets and junk throughout the day, spiking my blood sugar like a rollwr coaster. Even though I eat a big meal at night I wake up in the morning with a pretty flat stomach. again, I attribute this to just eating healthy food as opposed to McDonald's before bed."

Theres a lot of testimonials of people curing their depression and brain fog. Basically you have to take ice baths and do breath work. Ice baths have been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, in fact if you go hardcore you can eliminate all inflammation in the body, which could be causing brain fog for many people. Inflammation in the body is the cause of many diseases. I have been taking cold showers for a month now and it has TREMENDOUSLY reduced my fatigue and brain fog. But its still there, so now im going to start taking ice baths and work my way up to 15 minutes at a time with the hope that i will see more improvements. Brain fog has ruined my life and its ruining yours too, you have to take drastic measures. It sounds extreme to jump into freezing water everyday, but you'll get used to it, and at the very least, you will see noticeable improvements in your alertness and mood.

Dietandhealth,ewee43g,t3_cnpvo4,1565321368.0,"I struggled with over eating my whole life. The ONLY thing that worked for me is PREPPING MY FOOD. It's all about the meal prep. I make all my food for the week on Saturday or Sunday. This week I made oven baked chicken (well seasoned) with rice and stir fried veggies. I made pasta with steak and broccoli, and chicken and bean burritos. I also mix up the veggies in all my meals to keep it from getting boring. I have 10 food containers (got it from amazon) and I put my food in there. I eat 2 of those meals everyday. For breakfast I have oatmeal or toast with eggs. 

Sometimes after work im too lazy to make my own food. Or if im on my lunch break I'll just buy junk food. But after I started meal prepping I always have food for lunch and dinner ready to eat. And it tastes great too. It's important to.make the fold taste decent too. And it's important to mix it up every week. YouTube is a great place to find recipes. 

Make sure you actually make food you will enjoy eating. Or else you'll just end up quitting. Next step is to package the food in containers so it's super easy to pick up. And here's a BIG tip. Make sure you freeze any food that you won't eat in the next 3 days. Good only stays good in the fridge for about 3 days. Then it starts tasting weird. So freeze the rest of the food and just microwave it for 3 minutes and it'll taste fresh. Over time you will find how much food you prefer eating in a sitting or what kind.

ONE MORE THING. It's okay to not eat 100% clean. Sometimes I eat my chicken with barbecue sauce. Or I add some chocolate covered almonds in my oatmeal(never eat oatmeal bland) Or I put butter on my toast. Eat clean, but also you don't have to ear bland food. Season the shit out of everything, including your veggies. And add some unhleahty things to it if it helps you eat the food."
Meditation,ew9zslk,t1_ew87yqf,1565233962.0,"""Thoughts and feelings aren't yours"" I didn't explain this well. Before, I was attached to whatever emotions and thoughts I felt. If I was anxious, I WAS anxiety. If that makes sense... but human beings aren't anxious, depressed, tired etc...we feel SENSATIONS that arise in our body, but it's not who WE ARE. They are merely sensations. And we can separate ourselves from sensations such as sadness, anxiety, etc. In Sam Harris's book he describes it as looking at your life as if it were a movie, projected on a screen. As opposed to Being INSIDE the movie. That's what Buddhism and meditation teaches and practice. Our life is the movie, and we are merely spectators of the movie. The movie is so captivating if feels like we are really in the movie, but we arent. And once. Once you practice meditation and learn this philosophy, pain is not nearly as powerful.

 Keep in mind I am a novice with very little experience. But the the positive effects I've experienced through  meditation and Buddhist philosophy is very real."
Meditation,ew36yfe,t1_ew35ip4,1565066251.0,"Literally the only thing I did was use a meditation app. I personally use ""Waking Up"" by Sam Harris.

Now I got the basics down and can meditate on my own anywhere anytime. In my house, while im waiting for the bus, at work. Even just 10 seconds makes a difference. 

The key concept I learned from meditation, in my very limited experience, is that thoughts and feelings aren't ME. Whever I start feeling down, or tired, or anxious, I observe these emotions in my body and separate myself from them. Im not a slave to my emotions as much as I was before. It hard to explain you.must experience it yourself to understand."

Go on YouTube and look at ""meal prep for men"" videos and find what food you might like. Then start preparing your meals and put them in container for lunch and dinner.

You'll either become anorexic, or you'll develop a binge eating disorder. It is impossible to eat that little. Try it, you won't accomplish anything.
