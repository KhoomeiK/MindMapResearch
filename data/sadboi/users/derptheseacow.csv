And then wrote next to it “lmao way too true anyone else relate?” I am having a panic attack lol. Should I say anything?"
StopSelfHarm,fln2a9t,t3_fpsy0d,1585306471.0,"I understand completely. I feel like you should definitely talk to someone close to you that you know will not judge you for it. I have been there with that tiny little razor cut that triggered so many suppressed urges. Seeing your comment has really made me think how I need to do the same. Some of my friends knew but the visible scars faded a while ago, but they don’t know I have started again. You shouldn’t have to carry this weight on your own. I often feel like I don’t want to burden anyone as well, but I know the important people in your life wouldn’t want you to feel this way. I’m proud of you and you need to stay strong! :D"

You should definitely find out whether she is into women. However, if she is not, I would definitely go ahead with a dating app. It is definitely one of the best places to find women who like women. Good luck!"

You deserve to wear whatever you want and shouldn’t let nasty comments stop you. Your scars are just like any other battle scars and they shouldn’t have to be covered. The fact you were brave enough to wear them in the first place is amazing. Don’t let anyone take that away from you with their insensitive comments. Please take care of yourself ❤️"

StopSelfHarm,f6ousmv,t3_dscfha,1573036155.0,"I know a few. They definitely don’t offer the exact same effect but it can relieve the urges. 

I fling elastic bands on my wrist when I get intense urges. The stinging can help stimulate the area of your brain that is stimulate when you self harm. The biggest downside is the huge welts it can leave, but in the long run this won’t leave scars. 

When sad:

Hold a pet or pillow. Squeeze it as hard as you can.

Soothing non-sad songs.

Drawing

Play music

Light your favourite candle

Play a game that improves your mood.

When angry:

Exercise. Dance and running is my favourite. Releases happy chemicals. This 

Hit something, whether it’s a punching bag or a tree with a stick.

Squeeze ice cubes. I don’t find they give the same relief for me. 

Throw ice against a wall

Scream into a pillow

Write out how your feeling. My psychologist recommended this as it is an excellent way to express your emotion without suppressing it. If there is someone in particular causing stress write it to that person. Then destroy the not as creatively as you want. 

Some of these work better than others but it’s all about finding what works best for you. ❤️❤️❤️"
StopSelfHarm,f6ou2av,t3_ds7fhq,1573035020.0,"I feel the exact same way. Except I can’t go a month without relapsing. Now that everyone knows there is a huge pressure not to relapse. 

10 months is an incredibly long time without doing it and I’m proud that you were able to do that. A slip up like this is not the end. I personally try to go as long as I can without doing it, because if I can stop many as many urges as I can that’s progress. You haven’t failed. Keep going. I will do myself a favour and try to listen to my own advice. Beating yourself up is going to make it worse, and I know it makes me want to do it more. You probably already know that, and it is hard to speak to yourself nicely, but it can help. I relapsed a few days ago and I felt so anxious about it I felt sick. And I had the whole beating yourself up thing like you did and constantly worrying that everyone is disappointed.

I’m proud of you. You’ve got this and don’t give up. ❤️"
