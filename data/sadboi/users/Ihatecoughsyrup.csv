In the tv show she was just a bit shallow and self-centered while in the book she was narcissistic, opportunistic and didn‚Äôt care about anyone except herself. In the show Beck was destroyed when Peach died, in the novel it was obvious that she couldn‚Äôt care less and that she was just using Peach the whole time. 

Anyway I think all the characters were worst in the book. Joe for example he is an obsessive stalker in both the tv show and the book but at least in the tv show he was personable and witty. In the book he is just a super creepy asshole."
