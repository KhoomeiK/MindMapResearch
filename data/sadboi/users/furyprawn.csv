depression,ezwcl40,t3_cpidz8,1568213518.0,"This exactly. My whole life I've felt like that, to the point where when I was eleven years old having panic attacks I used to cry to my mom that I wanted to go home, even when I was home.

I still find myself mumbling it from time to time when I'm depressed or anxious. It just comes out of nowhere."
