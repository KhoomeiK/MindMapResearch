There was a girl in class who never showers, never washed her clothes, and never brushed her hair, and smelled every day very bad and she got confronted by others for that before, but she just doesn't care about hygiene (lets call her P).

So the girl who sensed the poop she immidiately said that ''Where is this awful smell coming from? I think it's from P hahahaha''.  P's face got red.

In the last class we had that day I was sitting in front of G, then she smelled the dog poop again and looked at P who was sitting in the other side of the class, meters away. And then G said ""OMG I can smell P's awful smell from here!"". P is got red again."
