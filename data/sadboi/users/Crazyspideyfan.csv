Since when has Nate’s gameplay in the trilogy ever matched what happens in cutscenes and important story moments? The whole point of Uncharted 4 is that Nate is not who he used to be."
PS4,fplbb63,t1_fplaz09,1588709653.0,"No it’s not. If you see inclusivity and diversity as an attack on straight white men, then that’s because you want to see it as that. I think LGBTQ+ people are allowed to be put in games after decades of no representation."
PS4,fpl60yb,t1_fpl4uv2,1588706992.0,"SPOILERS***

This concept of a character would have still existed in some form even if they weren’t LGBTQ+. When developing who this character is, what there motivates them, etc., that’s when things about their identity are developed. The creators of the game don’t just go “We are going to have a specifically LGBTQ+ character kill Joel, just to piss off Gamers.” The point is, none of the story is affected by a character being LGBTQ+, it just so happens that they are. But no, everyone is blaming it on LGBTQ+ people again, when it has nothing to do with that. Because to Bigots, LGBTQ+ people exist as assets and things “just added/shoved in”, not people."
PS4,fpl4ggd,t1_fpl44lr,1588706194.0,It doesn’t require them a character to be straight either. A character being LGBTQ+ does not change the story in any way.
PS4,fpl3lwb,t1_fpl2wo5,1588705766.0,"Games like TLOU exist to tell stories. Any story set in a post-apocalyptic world will have a political message, or else it doesn’t have meaning to the story. The game is inherently politically. If your referring to LGBTQ+ representation, that isn’t a political message, it just happens that LGBTQ+ people exist, and should be represented fairly in media. People aren’t politics."
PS4,fpl31pm,t1_fpl2qr3,1588705487.0,"I have deduced that by now lmao. They’ll just keep on backtracking, even though they know exactly what they’re trying to say."
PS4,fpl2vo4,t1_fpl2ate,1588705401.0,"You still haven’t answered the question?? Why does including LGBTQ+ people weigh down the story?? If the sitewite rules you’re referring to is no hate speech, than yeah, you shouldn’t answer, but I have absolutely no clue what point you’re trying to make. You’re avoiding the entire argument you’re trying to make in the first place."
PS4,fpkzebk,t1_fpky9x8,1588703676.0,"Ok, they won’t change at all lol, every time bigots say sales will go down, they never do. Captain Marvel, Borderlands 3, etc,etc. And you’re still too afraid to tell me why you think LGBTQ+ people weigh down a story."
PS4,fpkxzat,t1_fpkxu35,1588702980.0,Yeah? And what part of that story is affected by LGBTQ+ representation? What changes because of it?
PS4,fpkwqhj,t1_fpkwgc0,1588702363.0,"And why is that a bad thing? It means more representation is in video games, and we get more interesting stories. This game isn’t being weighed down because of representation and inclusivity? Or is this a classic case of gamers not wanting to see LGBTQ+ people in their games? Again, why is this a bad thing?"
PS4,fpkufuo,t1_fpk9jep,1588701224.0,Are you fucking serious? Gamers hate women so much they still find a way to blame Anita Sarkeesian

CODZombies,fpe5gl9,t1_fpe5arc,1588540727.0,"Ok that was one thing I was worried about, how the art style will translate, I feel like the Zombies may not look as “rigid”? I don’t know, something about it."

assassinscreed,fp3393g,t1_fp32roa,1588272333.0,"I can respect wanting a defined character, but you specifically wanted the female version to be a glitch. I think what we’re getting is fine, as we can select the gender of the same character, instead of two different characters in Oddysey, which some people didn’t like. Either way, Valhalla’s main character will be the same person no matter which gender you choose."
assassinscreed,fp2x5om,t1_fp2wr2l,1588269367.0,"Because why does it have to be the male character? They are literally giving us gender options for the same main character, and he still wants the female one to be a “glitch”. Why not be happy with what we’re getting? It’s the same character  with the same name either way."
assassinscreed,fp2wkt0,t1_fp2wbo4,1588269089.0,"If he prefers to play as male, he can. The problem is were he wants the female character to be seen as the “non-canon” character essentially, when it could also be the male character."
assassinscreed,fp2pdlr,t1_fp2fwxk,1588265656.0,"Why can’t the female character be the main one? You’re automatically wanting to just have the male version, why not an Assassins Creed with a solo female main character?"
