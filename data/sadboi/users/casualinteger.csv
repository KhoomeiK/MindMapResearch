My episode with hallucinations lasted for a week before my wife committed me. I literally had no idea I was so deluded from the THC I was taking for chronic pain. Immediately started Abilify 15mg for a month (THIS GAVE ME AKATHISIA) then weaned down over the next two months to 1mg then I've been off it since mid february. (Akathisia stopped)

So now I take 15mg tamazepam(Restoril) to sleep at night. I also take 1mg lorazapam if I get too stressed out. I still have an extra bottle of emergency Risperidone 1mg but I haven't had to take it yet. I stay away from stressors  (which is hard because i have kids but I love them). I don't have insurance so I go through a social worker and I see an addiction specialist once a month and a psychologist. I have been working with a psychiatrist also I get to talk to him next month.
