1. As others have said, interviews are tough even for normies.  For us with anxiety, they are truly challenging.  Be proud of yourself for giving it your best shot!
2. There was one interview I had where I felt I really dropped the ball on one of the questions.  After I took a sad walk home and napped for a few hours, I woke up still thinking about the question.  Eventually, I decided to give it another try, and eventually wrote up my answer and emailed it to the hiring manager, and told him I was really excited about the job.  I ended up getting the position!  Now that I've been on the hiring side a few times, I can just say: going the extra mile really does make someone stand out as a candidate.
3. Being an excellent and productive member of a team is far more than just being able to answer ""gotcha"" questions in a highly stressful environment.  If a company doesn't understand that, then you're probably dodging a bullet by not working there and subjecting yourself to a toxic work culture.
4. *""don't even ask him the other ones because he probably won't get them.""*  Fuck that guy.  He sounds like he has low EQ, and he's probably got his own issues."
