depression,fpdm687,t3_gcnpaj,1588529727.0,"I've been suffering from severe depression with Bipolar I and Panic Disorder since I was around 19. I was actually diagnosed around 21 then suffered a nervous breakdown at 22. I'm not really sure what happened, but I recall being very miserable. I just snapped one day after my ears were ringing from the Panic Disorder non-stop. I told my Boss I can't handle it anymore and I need to see a Doctor. I went to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist that actually diagnosed me with Panic Disorder after a full exam with a few test. My Depression has been very sever and I have suffered from Chronic Fatigue since my early 20's. I'm now 38 and have been with my partner for 5 years. I feel like I have been through hell and back. I do feel I kept fighting even though I suffered anyway. Most of the time the Depression is so bad I'm bedridden. I don't know if I would consider myself lazy because I get tired of hurting so bad when I do stuff. I think being on the phone should come with some boundaries and trying to get at least one to a few other things done a day. I can say that I fail at this some days. Get a Counselor and see a psychiatrist regularly. The counselor has helped me vent and work on the issues I've had. The psychiatrist has helped adjust my medications over the years. There have definitely been a lot of dark times. I came to the conclusion that having kids wasn't a good idea for me. My Mother also has Mental Health disorders and I didn't want to pass it on. We don't have to live a fairy tale life. We can all do things differently. Take it one day at a time or even one hour if you have to. The hardest challenge for me is trying to be more positive. I try to count my blessings when I am super depressed. I start with Extreme basics like clean water to drink, food to eat, clothes to wear, bed to sleep in, a roof over my head, and so on. Hope this helps."

It's been a while since I was in the field. While I was looking for information in the past I read that ADHD is often misdiagnosed in teens then later diagnosed as Bipolar Disorder. It may be a good idea to find a good counselor to talk about what you are going through. Teens have so many hormones going on that adding a medication can be dangerous if not well managed. Best of luck"
depression,foq8a2s,t1_foptl3y,1587986462.0,It's a good thing you know what is going on now. You can work on it now and hopefully get the help you need in order to move forward in life.

It's very special that you had such a incredible relationship with your girlfriend.  Some people can go through their whole lives and never know love. Some people are so filled with bitterness that they die inside. You are a very strong young man to have made it through this type of trauma. I don't know that I could have made it through myself. It's incredible that you know how much pain taking your life would cause your loves ones. Continue to reach out as you feel comfortable.  and begin the healing process on your own time. You don't have to get over her or follow any rules people tell you about how to grieve over her loss. Do things at your own pace. It may very well be a good idea after the trial to get a fresh start in a new area. This is such a terrible tragedy and its not your fault. You have every right to be angry at the guy(s) that did that to her. I'd probably want revenge myself, but it won't make the pain go away. It would just make it worse. 
Stay strong for her and live the kind of life she would want you to."
depression,foq45zp,t3_g8xtme,1587982349.0,"Hey, I am really sorry to hear that you are going through this. From the time I was a little I felt nearly identical to how you are describing yourself. I blamed myself and thought there clearly must be something wrong with me. At 21 I was diagnosed with Bipolar and Panic Disorder. The primary problem was a constant depression I felt when I wasn't distracted by other things in life. Then, As soon as my mind was able to think again everything seem to come back. Have you ever gone to a counselor to talk about what is going on? It sounds like you could benefit from therapy of some sort. I take medication myself, but I strongly urge that to be a last resort. Depression is more common than most people think. You are not alone in how you feel."
