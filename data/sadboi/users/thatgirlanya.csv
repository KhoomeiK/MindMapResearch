I dropped out of school and was extremely suicidal after a long bout of what I recognize now as mania and then I was diagnosed. I totally remember the obsession of things or people during that time to. I still sometimes have it. I do have an obsessive personality but I feel that bipolar made it worse and can put me in stupid situations. I also have adhd so that probably makes it worse too.

It’s good that you’re going to get evaluated. If you do get diagnosed, remember everyone experiences this illness differently. I’m bipolar 2 and my hypomania is so much different than some peoples mania with bipolar 1. Sometimes it scary when you read on here some others experiences and then I worry that I’m going to go through the same thing.

I think people assume that to get any benefits they have to do intense workouts. But it’s just not true. Start slow and take as long as you need to work yourself up to at least 30 minutes 3x a week. It changes everything. 

I also had to think of exercise less like exercise and more like “injecting yummy brain chemicals into my brain to make it work right”. Sounds weird but it works so well. Gets me off the couch because I KNOW I will feel better afterwards.

This is why I don’t associate myself with any groups because I don’t want to be associated with those people. I think society should start shifting away from groups like that and encourage free and inquisitive thought. I was literally in a debate with a radical feminist and I asked her WHY she thought all the problems she brought up were happening. She legitimately said to me “I don’t ask why, I just know it is”. That one sentence told me she has one brain cell. It’s incredible. From what I’ve noticed, feminists love to complain about things but rarely if ever bring possible solutions to the table. It’s always “it’s your problem you should fix it”. It’s garbage."
MensRights,fp6b9lt,t3_gbjvm4,1588349367.0,"I understand where you’re coming from. I’m a woman and support equality and I see this sub supporting a true definition of equality more so than any feminist thing I’ve seen. I don’t align myself with any thought groups because I don’t think it’s helpful (off topic so I won’t go into why I don’t here). 

I used to be a feminist and any feminism I’ve been exposed to encourages sexism against men because ‘it’s not true sexism’. I feel that feminism has normalized radicalization more than it used to, say 8 or so years ago. Also I would be rich if I had a dollar for how many time feminists have told me that my opinions are because of internalized misogyny or that they aren’t my opinions but only come from the influence of a man. I have NEVER been treated like that by a MRA. MRAs have always treated me and spoken to me like an equal and never questioned my intelligence. Can’t say the same for feminism. 

I feel that modern feminism infantilizes and takes away autonomy for women who share different opinions than them. I’ve experienced it first hand countless times. I also have noticed that it’s seriously rare to have a calm, collected, and respectable debate with a feminist. It always results to name calling and stupid petty shit. If I could actually debate and be treated like a human by feminists, I probably wouldn’t dislike them as much. I’ve never had this problem on this sub ever or with MRAs in real life, even though sometimes I disagree with things they believe. Nobody is going to 100% agree on everything with another person and I feel like MRAs understand and respect that more than most feminists.

MensRights,fp63mzw,t1_fp60x1e,1588345450.0,"I see what you’re trying to say now. I’m glad you don’t actually think what I had originally said! 

I think, at least from my perspective, the fact that both women and men have created and perpetuated the problems this sub talks about it almost implied. Like I feel like every one knows that except for the VERY FEW people here that are asshats. 

In my opinion, any kind of group (like meninism or feminism) are not good. It perpetuates group think to a worrying degree and invites people to join their groups without actually thinking and learning about what the group stands for or even encouraging thinking for yourself. I’m only on this sub because I think that women have too much power in society right now and that men are really having the short end of the stick (and I’m a woman). I also see that sexism against men is being normalized and I have a big problem with that. I don’t really see this sub as a ‘meninist’ sub at all, but I could be wrong. It’s definitely not MGTOW or whatever that sub is called. 

I do think that most men on this sub understand that men also perpetuate the problems that we talk about here unless they are idiots. I think that most feminists understand their part as well, that women perpetuate some of the problems they talk about. Just because it’s not explicitly mentioned doesn’t mean that people don’t acknowledge it.

OP, you are completely right in your viewpoint. This is also a very American/western view point. It’s 0-100 with them. All or nothing. Nuance means nothing to them. 

What you are seeing in the comments is modern feminism in action. I used to be a feminist too (years ago) but then started asking questions, using logic, and boy howdy did I realize how I suffered from group think. Modern feminism infantilizes women and takes away their autonomy. You’re seeing it in action as these women in the comments are telling you that your opinion is wrong because it’s not your opinion.. it’s a mans influence on you. They can’t stand when a woman has a mind of her own and looks at the world in a quizzical manor instead of just rolling with the feminist group think. They simultaneously say that women are powerful but then also that they should be treated like they are weak children and need help with everything. I’m not sure why or how things got to this point but it’s terrifying. Feminism served its purpose already and now they are grasping at straws to find something to fight against. 

They also are constantly in fight mode, looking to be angry at something. They don’t listen to anyone with different opinions. They just use buzzwords to call them names that they don’t know the definitions of and call it a day. There’s very few feminists that are actually willing to have a calm and cool debate and are willing to answer questions. 

Keep questioning. Keep looking for your own information instead of trusting things at face value. If you keep doing this, you’re most definitely going to be shit on but don’t get discouraged. Fighting this hive mind is the only thing that will help other women think for themselves in the future and give them a voice. It makes me happy that someone as young as you is questioning things around you. Keep it up. You have a lot of silent supporters out there."

An example would be like when I’m driving and the music is too loud or the sun is too bright or I’m uncomfortable, I have a hard time focusing on driving because the stimulation is so overwhelming. It’s like my brain is being bashed in a million spots and there’s a huge pressure in my head when it happens

Half the time Im rooting for her and then sometimes I think she's an idiot. But thats what makes a compelling character. I crave more female characters written like her. Im not entirely sure why everyone (men and women) seem to have such a hard time writing them? Its really not that hard to write a compelling character. But most people write things for a political statement now instead of true storytelling. So annoying"
BipolarReddit,fnjyeha,t3_g24qd6,1587009981.0,"Not married yet but have been engaged forever. I couldn't live without him. I am extremely open about my illness and he deals with his own mental illnesses as well (though different from mine). We understand each other on a very deep level, and I am so lucky to have him in my life. 

Good relationships can be had with good people, communication, and introspection from both parties. Most relationships usually struggle with the last two. Having a deep understanding of yourself is also something I think is needed for a deep connection with someone."
bipolar,fnfvacc,t3_g1f0n1,1586916217.0,I angry clean a lot because of this. Usually I’m thinking “why can I not keep things clean for more than two days what is wrong with me” the whole time.
ADHD,fnb645e,t1_fnb3724,1586809875.0,I don't know how many times that Ive put off doing art because 'I don't have the right pencil or the right notebook' even though I have a million different pencils and notebooks
ADHD,fnb5ulq,t3_g0llsu,1586809742.0,"My current version of 'creativity' is scrolling and saving other peoples art that I find inspiring. But then I get frustrated that my drawing skill is not at the same level as my tastes and then I give up. Then repeat the cycle. and never pick up a goddamn pencil.

Basically your ability to see mistakes progresses faster than your ability to remedy these mistakes. Your taste in art will probably always surpass your current level of skill. But overcoming that and continuing on is the hard part"

adhdwomen,fn9docn,t3_g0f0by,1586768932.0,"Sounds like what you’re describing is called ‘hyper focus’ from adhd. I’m not a doctor so don’t quote me but definitely seems similar. Also sounds like you have a perfectionist personality to a fault. I do too and it fucks me a lot of the time. I frequently think “why do something if I can’t do it perfectly the first time around?” Sucks when trying to learn something that takes a lot of practice. 

Bipolar and adhd go hand in hand so I wouldn’t be surprised if you get a positive diagnosis. 
I’ve been diagnosed bipolar since I was 19 and five years later finally diagnosed with adhd. I’m not sure if you can relate but when I am doing well in the bipolar realm, that’s when I struggle the most with adhd. Sometimes it gets overridden with anxiety/mania/depression, but when everything else is in check, my adhd comes out to play hardcore. 

If you have any questions feel free to pm me!"

BipolarReddit,fn88mb4,t3_g009jr,1586736224.0,"Im on Latuda 40mg, Concerta 36mg and 300mg of Welbutrin. The Welbutrin pulled me out of a deep depression, which was nice. Im perpetually exhausted (have been since I was a kid) but Ive noticed that when I do more to take care of myself (exercise more, eat healthier, get in a strict routine) I am SO MUCH BETTER. The problem is the 'action' aspect of this, which is where my ADHD comes in. Logically I know how to feel better, but its so hard to just DO IT. Its truly a never-ending battle.

I recently got a job (before all this corona shit) and worked for two weeks and the routine boosted my mood and energy so much. I could say I was actually happy for once. Now, I am in quarantine and have no real routine (except a little sleep routine) and I feel so down, lethargic, and depressed. Taking care of myself has gotten harder and I desperately need social interaction. 

With ADHD, I am horrible at giving myself structure, but when it is provided to me (IE: a job, or an outside responsibility) I do much better and am able to construct a routine. When I have a routine, I cycle less and am so much more stable with my moods. I truly believe that bipolar people NEED a routine to be their best self. 

My only problem with Latuda is the nausea. I have to take anti nausea meds no matter how much I eat with it. Ive been on it for 3+ years and its the only thing that has provided me with stability in my moods."

Not to the degree that I used to, but its something to take my mind out of the void.

I don't require men to do anything for me, financially or otherwise. But it is nice to feel protected when walking at night together, and other things too, though they are not any less of a man for not doing traditionally 'masculine' roles (like being the breadwinner in a family for example). Like you said, on their terms. I wish more women were like this but many do use men like tools, which is disgusting."

 Sorry you're being called an Incel too. Hope you don't take it to heart. You definitely are not one. You have every reason to be cautious of women in this climate. Hell, even Im cautious of women when I am looking for friends. Usually millennial women though, older women don't suffer from all this shit as much."

And even when they are proved not guilty, they are still treated socially like they are guilty of that crime. It’s ridiculous. Completely infuriates me. This same thing can be said for other crimes too. It’s just an annoying thing humans do. 

This believe all women thing is absolute insanity. Believing an entire group of people because they have a pussy is crazy. As a woman, women can be INSANE. I’ve seen it first hand. I’ve seen women (like on this original post) in real life many times. They brag when they are like this. They can be so manipulative and now the law allows them to be.

I have a hypothesis that it’s because the current generation hasn’t experienced true widespread hardship. I feel like the most stable and sane people have had a rough time in life and have experienced genuine hardship to strengthen them. Your view on things changes. 

I know I’ve dated a lot of really weak willed men who couldn’t stand up for themselves, let alone me. I want a man that will take no shit from anyone. I want to feel safe because my man can protect me if need be. Like why is that a bad thing now? It’s simple biology. Wanting to feel protected and safe because my man can protect me doesn’t make me any less of a woman and certainly doesn’t “take away my power”. It’s so annoying. The fact that men and women are different and that’s ok is debated now and it’s so WEIRD. I think people think “different” means “lesser” but that’s just not the case."

However, I feel (as a woman) that men have more at risk finding a mate in this time than women do. More is on the line for them. If they get falsely accused, it’s honestly worse than death. Your entire life is taken away. Mental health down the drain. Homelessness. No help whatsoever and socially exiled. It absolutely breaks my heart. 
Women can basically get away with murder now and it’s terrifying. 

At least that’s just my observation as a woman in western culture right now. Obviously there are always risks on both sides when finding someone, but goddamn men have it fucking hard."
