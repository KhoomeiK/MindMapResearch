Toward the end  I've usually got a slightly mixed bowl because the action of eating kind of stirs everything together, and while adjusting the ratio of ingredients to my taste.

WhitePeopleTwitter,f4et44a,t1_f4eh81r,1571562839.0,"I totally agree, but I think it's a bit more complicated than that if you live in Texas or SoCal or wherever. There's a This American Life, the name of which escapes me, that explores a town with one of the highest illegal immigration rates. It goes into some of the stuff racist people complain about that we don't see that often in cities with lower rates. Unscrupulous factories hiring ""scabs"" (if someone could offer a non-epithetical term please do, I don't know one) and people driving without licenses or training, causing accidents, are a couple examples.
 
I need to clarify that I 100% believe that people who complain about illegal immigrants doing the above ARE being racist. It's understandable to cross a picket line if you've put everything on the line to feed your family. It's understandable to drive without a license/experience if it's your only way of getting to work. Just as many lower-income people do both things for the same reasons, and most people would do the same in that position. 

That said, from a racist of view, it's like, ""this person just caused an accident and fled the scene, this happens in my town a lot, and it's always an illegal immigrant..."" Yadda yadda yadda.

It definitely adds another layer to the ""indie record that's *much* cooler than mine"" dig."

She's definitely in my top 5 now."

memes,etq1zit,t1_etq06sh,1563070376.0,"I'm an omnivore but my partner is vegetarian, so I have a lot of opportunities to compare.

I actually prefer the fake stuff to actual chicken in all the scenarios where it's breaded and fried, because it doesn't get stringy or dry like chicken can. The best I've had is the chick'n sandwich from HipCityVeg. I've had a lot of vegan chicken patties, which are easy to replicate because of their uniform texture, but even I was shocked that that wasn't the real thing. It tasted exactly like a juicy, brined fried chicken breast.

Veggie sausage isn't quite as miraculous, but it's still really close to the real thing. LightLife has these logs that you can make into patties or crumbles or whatever, so I use them for breakfast scrambles, sandwiches, etc. It's easier and more versatile than meat, lasts longer in the fridge and has a similar enough flavor/texture. 

Beyond/Impossible burgers aren't indistinguishable from meat by any means, but they have a textural quality about them that can't be replicated in any other non-meat burger. I'd order one of those instead of a meat burger at any place where you couldn't order a burger rare. There isn't a substitute for steak/burgers the way I *really* like them... which is basically raw in the center."

AskReddit,epzx7fs,t1_epzgqvq,1559674378.0,"This is made especially difficult when the person's partner is reactive to them doing ""bad things"". I've caught myself instinctively lying or arguing when I've done something selfish instead of owning up to it, because nothing gets my partner more angry than when I've acted selfishly. Sometimes I get a tirade whether I apologize and own up to it or not, and sometimes it doesn't even matter if I actually did the thing being perceived as selfish, so it's like... What is the benefit to accepting wrongdoing?

The answer is, of course, that someone has to break the cycle, or it will never end. I've got a lot of work to do on myself anyway. I might as well accept my share of the blame and the consequences that come along with it, even if they're unfair sometimes. Playing relationship chicken (I'll treat you right, but only of you treat me right first) never works."

It's sad because, like she says, he was saying all of the things her heart wants to hear. That's how these guys pick up so many women.

AskReddit,eona958,t1_eljsv0w,1558707778.0,"Hmmm. That is really interesting. It might be a bit of a chicken-or-egg thing, too... I'd be curious to know how diplomatic strategy would change if an unrivalled military power were removed from the equation. As things currently stand, there's very little reason to try to avoid or stay out of conflicts, and that fact necessitates a military that's always ready for the next conflict."
thebachelor,eomsx9k,t3_bscfo8,1558695661.0,"Normally I'd consider this phrase sexist, but Luke P. has me re-evaluating that. He legit has crazy eyes! It's one of those things that's hard to put your finger on but it's impossible to miss. It makes the person seem ""off"". The last time I knew a person with eyes like that, she faked a pregnancy, faked a miscarriage, and her bf only found out because she told everyone at their (shared) workplace about it."
thebachelor,eomsise,t1_eolhm8o,1558695413.0,"It's so clear to me that he isn't here for TV or attention or fame... at least not when compared to some of the other guys. The show is the ultimate test of his pick-up skills. If you watch him through that lens, it becomes *really* obvious that he has ""moves"", he's pulling out all the stops on Hannah, *and he's done all of these things before*.

Worst of all, she's buying it. At least Becca sent ~~Jean Pierre~~ Jean Blanc or whoever packing when he pulled the whole ""this is crazy but..."" fake profession of love thing. For god's sake, the guy only did it because he doesn't have enough substance to do anything else on stage. Even something dumb, to show that he could laugh at himself. He literally said that!

Imo this season is full of the fuckiest fuckbois I've ever seen, and Luke P. is the worst of them. My only reason for continuing to watch is that it's so early on that he won't be able to maintain his act. He's Mr. ""Sweep her off her feet and immediately lose interest"". Deny a guy like that in stage one, and they slowly become more obsessive and eventually, they lose their damn minds. I'm looking forward to that."
