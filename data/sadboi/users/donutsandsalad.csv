Anxiety,f9724v8,t3_e3yh4e,1575157504.0,"I just got home and crying over some BS after my grocery store trip. I’m the same, I literally drive extra 20 minutes to a store because it is less crowded , I have 2 best stores 5 minutes away with better sales, and quality products. But all I care is  amount of people they have. 
Went to the store today, got stuff for my dinner as quickly as I could. Going to check out and this very large old man shows up and gets to the line first , at least what it seems. But then he stops and stares at  a beverage cooler next to the line staring at it. I get confused because he’s just staring at the beverage cooler, he has no basket or a cart so I think “Ohh he’s just a weird old man who is picking a drink”. I slide ahead. About five seconds later,  he taps me on my shoulder and yells,” Excuse me, I’m in a line”, I say “ Oh sorry”. He goes,” It’s right behind me!!” His time is very mean. I am PISSED, I say “Oh! Well you were staring over there(point at the cooler) so I wasn’t sure.” Im shaking. I play in my head, “How could I be so rude and cut him?! “Then I think,” No but anyone would be confused the way he just stared at the cooler, and he was so rude about everything.” then I felt that the entire store was staring at me and thinking what a piece of shit I’m. Anyways, this TINY stupid event made me cry for an hour. And I’m all mad about it 2 hours later. Funny thing? I won’t be back to that store..need to find a different store now."

First is to give myself that relaxing time because I know I need it. Second is to get a plan on how to finish it. I think about everyone who would love to see me fail, how my fate is in my hands, how I won’t let it go wrong. I take a walk and get my beast mode on and start. Once you start, you keep going. Then it’s fine.  If you let yourself panic about needing to relax, it adds to your stress. You have to accept your method, and learn how you work. Nobody matters but you. Relax then start."
