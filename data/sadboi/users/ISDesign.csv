I personally recommend the Lancôme one, but I’ve used the Obagi Vit C before as well. If price point is a factor (I only splurged bc I was desperate) I’m sure TO has a serum as well. I also recommend SuperGoop Unseen sunscreen.

I’m about to dart back in the bathroom and add the blush now! Y’all have me really excited about the outcome. Highlighter kinda freaks me out because my skin is darker. I know other people with my tone do it, but I’m not sure about the color or PLACEMENT! Any tips on that?!"

bipolar,fmo4tjx,t3_fwfru7,1586245412.0,"I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. Really must suck. Maybe try writing how you feel to yourself and really analyze what’s causing you the most stress. Try and rest (as hard as that may be) and review and organize your thoughts in the morning. I’ve been trying this practice lately myself - mostly for a particularly aggressive coworker. The feelings are polar opposites but I think the general concept is transferable. 

Also- food for thought the foundation of a relationship is communication and I’d say even more important in a relationship with mental illness (and even more important with both). should you determine to continue your relationship, you need to discuss his diagnosis and your own as these insights could prevent or shed light on future instances like this.

She USED to be VERY active. I was in college when I got her and there were lots of other dogs around for her to run with. But over time, she’s decided to conserve her energy for begging at dinner time, greeting guests, and moving from one dog bed to the other.)  She JUST recently got arthritis, she’s rarely ill, honestly if she’d stop eating questionable items she’d be golden. The vet jokingly dismisses everything I say by saying “well she’s 20”.

No special diet, just Nutro Senior. Walks and stairs exhaust her and she hobbles for a while after so we blocked off the stairs.
