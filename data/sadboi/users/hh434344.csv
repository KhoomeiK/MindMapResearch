Either your illness makes you completely unable to do anything or you can do everything and just need to suck it up. There is no middle ground. The only thing that works I think is explaining, repeatedly, what your current situation is. For example, today I just couldn’t go to work. I just need a day off. My husband was a bit upset with me but I just said I needed a mental health day. If he doesn’t understand then too bad. I just have to do what I need to do. I guess what I am trying to say is that you can’t expect people to understand. Just do what you need to do to take care of yourself."
