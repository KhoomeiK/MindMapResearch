povertyfinance,fp76bm6,t1_fp6rxo0,1588364849.0,"I agree on the idea of a bulk store membership. If you have a decent size freezer, it's not a terrible idea to stock up so you're going to the store less. I find it really easy to overspend the more times I have to go to the store. Each time I would pick up at least ONE thing that was like an ""impulse"" buy and the more times you go, the more ""just one"" things you get. I go every few months and get a variety of meats. I separate them out as soon as I get home and portion them into ziplock bags. Then I write a description, quantity/weight, and date frozen on the outside of the bag. It has helped get me through some tough times, not the least of which being this lockdown.

On the subject of meal planning, try to find at least a couple of meals that use similar ingredients to make in the same week. It makes it easier to use all the ingredients you have and not let them go to waste. Also, if you decide during the week that you don't feel like making that thing you decided on, it's easy to shift that into another recipe. There are also websites like [supercook](https://www.supercook.com/#/recipes) that let you search for recipes based on ingredients. My fiance and I are enjoying watching Bon Appetit videos on YouTube for inspiration lately.

Since you mentioned a couple of people in your home eat quite a bit, it might be in your best interest to focus on high protein meals for them as well. Lots of chicken and beans and other filling foods. I also prep a metric TON of bacon, egg, and cheese croissant breakfast sandwiches for easy breakfast on the go. What makes it much easier is realizing that you can *bake (!!!)* your eggs and bacon. That was a game changer for me. I bake eggs in little [silicone tart shells](https://www.wilton.com/6-piece-silicone-mini-tart-set-in-a-pet-tube/2105-5587.html?utm_campaign=smartshopping&gclid=Cj0KCQjwka_1BRCPARIsAMlUmEqNHoI5gU8xYj3C5B2n7-vRuvVPlYz9V1KwTP_5EI_j5_EXf4wz6lEaAkK4EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) but you can also do them in muffin pans. Set up an assembly line to throw those shits together then wrap and toss in the freezer. For good bulk breakfast you can do a good Oatmeal Bake or Egg Bake. I do an egg bake with sweet potatoes, turkey sausage, and egg whites that I really enjoy. Enchiladas has been a favorite dinner lately. Slow cook whatever protein you like, wrap it in some tortillas, cover in an [enchilada sauce](https://cookieandkate.com/enchilada-sauce-recipe/) and cheese then bake. Super simple and it makes a ton. 

Sorry for the rambling reply but I've been there and know how easy it is to let things get out of hand. It's also really easy to be overwhelmed by the options. Whatever works for you, good luck! You've made a great first step just asking for help."

MovieSuggestions,fhksnxl,t1_fhk5h1u,1581690514.0,"I think critics (along with most people) have a very love/hate relationship with Darren Aronofsky. I don't deny that I don't love all of his films. This film is no exception to his pretty typical fare of symbolism and discord. What differs with this one is the multiple plot line story telling. There are three different characters played by Hugh Jackman all on different but somehow the same quests to save the woman he loves. The stories fold over each other throughout the film in very literal ways. Some call that horrible story telling, others call it brilliant. It is very non-linear and subversive to the typical movie tropes we're used to. Not to say ""if you don't like it you just don't *understand!""* But rather that it just may not be what many people enjoy. 

I'm not even going to try to convince anyone that this is his best film. It just simply touched me in a way that other films don't. It deals in a very emotionally visceral way with impending loss and mortality on several planes of existence. 

tl;dr it's a very quiet movie that can be confusing. However, if you can give it the time to hear what it wants to tell you, it can be an emotional experience."

For you, you might also separate the lists based on things he can do and things you do when he's not there (or quarantined for the sake of his allergies). That way you have a starting point of what can be done when. 

I bought a couple of cheap picture frames and put a solid color piece of paper or fabric inside each one and use a wet erase marker to write my lists directly on the glass. Then I put them in a high traffic spot for us so we see it and can mark things off as they get done.

ramen,faoltvu,t1_faneg25,1576267228.0,"My opinion on tattoos like that is if you've thought about it seriously and it makes you happy, who cares if it's no longer relevant. Ultimately you're the one who has to live with it. Whatever you choose for your first ink, I hope you love it. Just make sure to find an artist who's good at the style you're looking for :)"

flicks,fao1l2t,t3_ea02es,1576255446.0,"I finally watched this yesterday and I just honestly believe that Adam Driver can do no wrong. He has this uncanny ability to be so earnest. His outpouring of emotion is just breathtaking. I went into this movie skeptical because I'm not a huge fan of ScarJo but everyone was great. It didn't feel the need to explain itself, it was emotional and painful in the most beautiful way."

culinary,fal3hz2,t3_e9pmku,1576177773.0,"There's a place in my local farmer's market that is a family business. They have a 2-year aged Wisconsin Cheddar that's great. They have longer aged cheeses as well. Local cheese shops not only will have more variety, but they often will be happy to give suggestions on what type of cheese will pair well with whatever you're making. You might also try checking in at /r/cheese for some other suggestions. Good luck!"
AskWomen,fakzqj1,t3_e9l24x,1576175868.0,"He had some problems with anger and generally had some pretty glaring emotional baggage. He had a really hard time controlling his emotions and was very anxious. He also was none too nice to his mother. 

Turns out he has been NOT dealing with some pretty crippling anxiety for most of his life while his mother had *mocked* him for it rather than helping. Ultimately once he faced the fact that he has true anxiety and wasn't simply incapable as a human, he started to hate himself less. He realized that I wasn't going to make him feel like less of a person for having difficulties doing things like making phone calls or going to busy stores and restaurants. We avoid trigger places and prepare before we go into difficult situations and he does just fine. 

That man has loved me with his entire heart every moment since he met me and I cannot imagine life without him. We have been together five years and every day I see him becoming a stronger and healthier person."
AskWomenOver30,faipsoa,t1_faig3u1,1576113721.0,"It's not easy, for sure. It took a few very unnecessary fights to finally be able to have some perspective in the heat of the moment. Try some positive reinforcement on your good days as well. Sometimes feeling appreciated goes a long way. I hope you guys find the sweet spot again!"
AskWomenOver30,fahsyyc,t3_e98xku,1576092848.0,"It is very difficult to have perspective when emotions are so high. My boyfriend has had some pretty serious anger problems in his life. He would flip his shit about the smallest stuff and then have no idea why he did it. After he would apologize profusely, realizing he wasn't really upset with me but not understanding where the anger came from. Sometimes it can just be stress leaking into home life. He would get stressed about something, not know how to deal with it, explode at me. I would be trying to keep my stress in check, then when he got upset at me I would get mad right back. It was an awful cycle of anger and nonsense that almost ruined us. No matter the reason, every person is going to respond a little differently. 

When I finally started trying to deal with the problem, it took a while to figure it out. No matter how much reasoning I did with him, explaining, understanding, speaking softly, none of it would quell his anger. News flash: no one likes to be told when they're being unreasonable. No matter how nice you are about it. The best thing for me with him was to step back and give the situation some time and space. It didn't work at first. I don't like to leave things unfinished and walking away while still upset was very frustrating for me. I had to learn to bite my tongue and not escalate. When he finally would calm down enough to realize he was being stubborn and unreasonable, he would come to me and apologize and we would work it out. 

The other thing I found that would help calm and center him sometimes I can't recommend unless you know for sure it's something they're comfortable with. We figured out together that physical contact can help him calm down. The image of the two of us sitting side by side on the edge of the bed, holding hands, while still angry, is ridiculous, I know. 

Ultimately what's best for the two of you is to have a conversation about it. From what you've told us, you seem to have a pretty open relationship with him as it is. Ask him what you could do or say that might help bring him down. Maybe set up some kind of signal word for when you know things are getting out of hand. Whatever works best for you guys, I hope you figure it out. Good luck!"
