You're not a Governor. You are not the entirety, nor are you, arguably, the majority of Republicans... the ones who write, vote for, and pass these laws.  


But by identifying and voting for things with an 'R' next to them, you are enabling them and their bullshit religious theocracy to survive and grow.  


You may not want to think that way, but the fact is, if you are ""Republican' and 'Athesit' you have some serioud dissonance going on that you need to do some serious Katelyn Ohashi type gymnastics."

Every anti abortion law is based on the Bible and put forth and supported by Republicans.

Every ""Prayer in school"" movement is pushed by Republicans.

Every God awful thing just about is pushed by Repuicans and that INCLUDES all the religious shit dogma that gets passed under the guise of ""Religious Freedom""

You concern trolling is garbage and if you try that whataboutism shit here, you get shut down. R or D.

It's just Republicans do it at every turn. Dems do it never."
