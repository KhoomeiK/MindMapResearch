Anxiety,fls0rw2,t1_flqox34,1585431922.0,"yeah same here! i have a friend in canada and we've been catching up. that's ONE good thing that's come out of this. i'm glad you reconnected with them! and i know, we really are being portrayed so intensely on the news which just makes me even more anxious.

oh man, i don't know if you got tested/have it but i hope you're doing okay and good on you for self-isolating. don't listen to their words, that'll do nothing but harm. i'm wishing the best.

yeah i've been really leaning on cuomo (especially today since trump said he might want to quarantine NY and cuomo's against that). i'm taking one day at a time at this point, there's nothing else we can do."
Anxiety,flpw3uq,t1_flpvk78,1585370529.0,"wow, it really is a small world haha! i haven't finished this book yet but it really has helped and opened my eyes up to things i was feeling but couldn't put into words. happy reading & stay safe!"
Anxiety,flpmmgo,t1_flplswa,1585363181.0,"nope, at least as of now it's not. cuomo is of course encouraging people to stay indoors as much as possible but he hasn't done a shelter in place for the city yet. he thinks going out for a short walk to get fresh air is important for physical & mental health which... sure ok. deblasio however keeps talking about a shelter in place so who knows, maybe it'll happen soon"
Anxiety,flph2iq,t3_fq8z5a,1585359316.0,"ah yes, we love #avoidance. i experienced this intensely last year (i lost two friends because of it) but after talking through it with my therapist and reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399169253/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_BKQFEbWQANSRF) (ch 8) i've started to learn why i was doing it and how to overcome it slowly. it really does suck because.... you physically can't bring yourself to answer after a certain time, or even immediately. i know it's difficult but don't worry! you're not alone!"

depression,ff85ezo,t3_es6jxp,1579666479.0,"hey man. i know how you're feeling. i took off of work today because i simply could not bring myself to leave bed. so i'm starting off by saying i'm proud of you. proud of you for being able to leave the house, even if it is just to go to work. that is a huge thing. losing interest in things you used to enjoy is very, very common. taking baby steps to slowly get back into it (maybe find new recipes that sound interesting to you and cook once a week, maybe even once every two weeks) is the best way to go about it so you aren't forcing yourself and you aren't setting super high expectations for yourself. i wish i could offer more but i'm really rooting for you. -a fellow 21 year old who also already feels hopeless."
