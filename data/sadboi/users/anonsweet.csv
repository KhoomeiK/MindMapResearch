ROCD,faidsbi,t3_e9eh7j,1576105456.0,"Right, I had this too, really badly. 

I read countless articles and books on it, and it never went. It was because I absolutely adored my ex so so much that I just wanted him to love me more than anyone else. It stems from lack of love from yourself. It went away as I split up from my ex, so the obsession was not with the person but with how I felt about my ex and how he felt towards me. You are most probably a perfectionist, wanting to be perfect and convinced by self doubt that she may have been perfect or that maybe you are so different that you can‚Äôt fathom how he can make such big jumps. It‚Äôs called retroactive jealousy, don‚Äôt be ashamed about it, I know it‚Äôs feels super embarrassing but you aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúpsycho‚Äù or any of the western bullshit people like to label people. I would seek therapy, and to be honest, it takes severe will power but avoiding doing any of the online snooping because each time your doing it, your rewarding that sort of addictive feeling that you crave which strengthens the brain pathways in that area basically making you addicted to it. It would excite me so much and make me feel physically sick and sometimes even get sick. but I would suggest solve the route of the problem, read books, follow the exercises!"

Sometimes things like this happen I‚Äôm pretty sure some people I‚Äôve known at that age have done the same. Maybe it‚Äôs not right but sometimes I think about beating people up to calm my mind down.  Whatever your having now is ocd. I had it about a sexual experience I had once and i felt awfully guilty.
OCD,evwzf4k,t3_clmj1l,1564877576.0,"if you sleep well normally, you don‚Äôt have it honestly. The restlessness is usually potent a lot of people with rls hurt their legs to try and numb the restlessness. You will know if you have it because you will be walking around/ stretching in strangest positions for ages just to feel comfortable.  I know the fear of it Cos sometimes during bad episodes I feel so so super anxious about it and hear horror stories too, and a couple times I‚Äôve lived what they call the horror stories. If you get sensations, have a bath, don‚Äôt read online, avoid sugar/caffeine. Lots of people can get sensations of restless legs and not have it as a chronic illness, my family have experienced it. You will be okay!"

The moving of leg is voluntary and anxiety can actually increase sensations in legs anyway. You would have experienced symptoms before if you had it, it‚Äôs not ever really a sudden thing. If you did have it,  it‚Äôs not the end of the world, there‚Äôs medicine. I sit for hours worrying about not sleeping again and how to cure my physical illness‚Äôs. I have many chronic issues that are all real and I obsess and obsess about how to solve them.  I found that joining forums on anything I have and reading the posts make it worse, I don‚Äôt wanna see people be miserable about something I‚Äôm already miserable over. I want to see the hope side of things. So don‚Äôt worry if you did have a sleep disorder there‚Äôs always a solution.  I got a sense of how you feel and I honestly have felt pretty similar.

I had no problem giving up smoking before and if this is causing mood swings or triggering mental health problems then fuck that id drop it.  Unfortunately addiction is slightly more complicated than you make it out to be,  I‚Äôm pretty sure people suffering from addiction have fought harder than you could even imagine. They aren‚Äôt weak people, and people who belittle and speak about addicts like the way you just did, have more weakness in them than they could ever acknowledge.

Even been paranoid it‚Äôs my new juul vape pen. I used to smoke 1/2 a day but this has much higher nicotine. I feel like regardless though if you have these illnesses there‚Äôs no point in pondering over what specific thing has set it off because it lived in you anyway,  and would have erupted some way or another, focus should be on treatment and coping and then looking for patterns in triggers unless it‚Äôs serious alcohol/drug addiction or abuse."

But this is not a healthy functioning human brain dealing with a breakup. I absolutely bet you if I raised my anti depressants or had mood stabilisers, I would still feel sad and miss my love, cry a bit but it would in a humane way, I‚Äôm pretty sensitive and dependant, but a future without my ex isn‚Äôt impossible to see.

I reckon if I do have bipolar it‚Äôs not as bad as some others Cos I‚Äôm not experiencing full blown mania and the hypomania seems kind of mild.  I have some good days where hypomania is quite energising and fun but it‚Äôs just the crashes and the mixed depression with this fucking weird ass shit. I‚Äôve been meaning to increase my anti depressants for ages, Cos of ocd and anxiety but I get bad bad side effects Cos I have restless leg syndrome which completely fucks my sleep :):) but starting meds for these too. Sometimes u just gotta be on a concoction of meds to live your life and people make you feel like a fucking nutcase just because you need these things.  I haven‚Äôt been feeling like this for long, about 2/3 weeks now maybe but I‚Äôve perhaps realised these episodes have existed before at different points of my life. Hypomania mixed with depression, I rarely get them standing alone one either follows the other or they both co incide. I know my sleep is fucked.  I have health anxiety too which interferes with my mental health and I just over stress about what‚Äôs wrong with me and what‚Äôs the solution. I miss being at least at a baseline where I can work on myself. I quit work too for a few weeks because it‚Äôs too draining and I can‚Äôt concentrate."
