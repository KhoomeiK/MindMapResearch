I spent my early adult life horrified I had the mind of a serial killer.  Now in my 40's I know it is OCD and I am not a serial killer.  I try and talk about mental illness openly and how awful they are.  One of the stigmas with mental illnesses is that they aren't that bad and you can just think better thoughts and get over them.  For lots of people they are horrible nightmares of diseases that never go away.  Talking about how bad they really are will hopefully help those who are fortunate enough to not suffer from them to have some empathy for those who do."

sex,fr3r2eo,t1_fr3p41y,1589863968.0,I would try getting yourself almost to an orgasm before he penetrates you and then go from there.  It sounds like it is just taking you longer than it is him.

sex,fr3ovl1,t3_gmhen2,1589862372.0,"For me orgasms are 95% mental.  It doesn't matter what is happening or getting rubbed/sucked/licked, if I am not able to just let my mind go and my body relax, it isn't going to happen.  Sometimes when my anxiety is bad it will take me awhile to get into the zone.  What are you doing before?  Are you doing a lot of foreplay that focuses on you?  Have you tried a toy while he is inside you?  Are you able to bring yourself to an orgasm by yourself outside of sex with him?  

The only way I have been able to have orgasms from me being on top is when he is hitting my g-spot.  This is easy to achieve if the guy is on the smaller side, but when they are larger, it usually only happens after they have had an orgasm and are not rock hard anymore.  

I would start with working on bringing yourself to orgasm without him involved.  Try different toys, try different positions, experiment when he is at work or when you have an afternoon at home alone and he isn't around.  Explore what gets you turned on.  Maybe thinking about him does.  Perhaps it's watching porn or reading erotic stories.  Maybe it's just touching your own nipples that really gets you going."

sex,fr3nqz3,t3_gmgn9t,1589861573.0,"There are so many reasons.  Have you seen how most women's vaginas look in porn?  Also lots of times you can have had a partner who was an asshole in the past.  A lot of women were raised in households where oral sex was a taboo thing as were vaginas and it's not easy to just get that wiring changed in your brain.

Another user correctly mentioned the vast array of feminine hygiene products marketed towards women to get rid of the smell and cleanse a vagina (none of them are actually good for a healthy vagina).  Growing up constantly hearing commercials about how your vagina should smell like a fresh field of flowers will subconsciously make you think that if it doesn't, it must smell bad and that your natural aroma is not pleasant.

Along those same lines is the expectation of what you think and hear men want.  It seems like most porn/songs/images show perfectly manicured and shaved vaginas and for a lot of women that kind of upkeep and maintenance just isn't going to happen, or for whatever reasons they prefer to not shave at all that could possibly make them feel self conscience.

printondemand,fqn0zp4,t1_fq8mdah,1589486844.0,"It depends on what people are following.  A lot of marketing and research and data shows that with e-commerce free shipping does convert better, even with higher prices.  Customers see value in paying a higher price for an item, but they have a much harder time swollowing a shipping charge because it doesn't seemingly have any value to them and let's not get started on how Amazon and so many others have conditioned customers to expect free shipping.  Free shipping when you spend XX amount can be an excellent strategy to get customers to purchase another item (seriously people would rather spend another $24 on a shirt from you to get free shipping, then to buy 1 shirt for $24 and then have to pay $6 in shipping costs- customers are willing to spend more to avoid paying a shipping cost, even when the total is higher than if they had just paid for shipping).    


I have noticed a few print on demand youtubers have videos  about this topic and to my surprise they have expressed that charging for shipping performs better.  I am not sure what metrics they are using to test, but I can say as a designer and web developer who has worked in e-commerce for the past 15+ years, free shipping ALWAYS performed better and lead to more sales and a higher conversion rate.  The trick is to finding the sweet spot in pricing where you don't lose money, customers spend more and your products aren't too overpriced for the customers."
printondemand,fqmzy4z,t3_ghlibq,1589486341.0,"as a designer 10 designs a month at $20/each is really really low.  I would be leery of someone claiming to charge so little as a professional designer.  They either are an idiot who has no idea the value of their time and work or they are just scamming and stealing copyrighted images and pawning them off to you as their own.  If you want a custom design just for your business I would expect to pay $200 for a single design from a designer.  Like another designer said, if you just want more commonly produced art files, you are better off just purchasing them on your own from Etsy sellers."

It's great you are getting her help and some therapy.  It will really help her to learn some coping skills so she can find a different outlet in those moments.  From everything I was taught by her therapist, kids usually cut as a coping mechanism for pain.  The immediate pain from cutting diverts their attention/numbs the pain they are feeling inside.  The best thing I was taught was to not get upset when she would cut herself and to just remain calm (which was not always easy to walk into her room and see her arms or legs and bed covered in blood).  Calmly reassure her that I was there for her and help her clean herself up and put medicine/bandages/or whatever was needed on them.  A lot of times her cutting was severe enough that we ended up in the ER or on the phone with therapist.  The worst thing you can do is get upset with her when she does it and blame or shame her or punish her.  It sounds like you are doing the right things and working to help her.
