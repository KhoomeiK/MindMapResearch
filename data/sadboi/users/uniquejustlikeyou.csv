bartenders,fr5dn9y,t3_gmkk43,1589906835.0,Mezcal is very rarely aged- that is more tequila specific because it was catering to European preferences. Tequila agave is cooked with steam but mezcal is usually a smaller batch and cooked in a pit over many days.

ptsd,fqbdozp,t3_ghsqmu,1589235083.0,"Your girlfriend sounds very similar to me a few years ago in terms of trauma, so I think just saying what I hope for may be helpful. First of all, the fact that she has allowed you into her life at all is significant. I‚Äôve never dated anyone longer than 3 months and many people are scared away when they get a whiff of how significant and deep the trauma runs. 

Second, progress may be slow but her symptoms CAN improve. Processing the traumas is extraordinarily painful but easing the burden of secrecy was my turning point, along with finally finding a medication with unobtrusive side effects. There will probably be a period of at least six months that are significantly worse before things start to lighten. 

Third, patience is key. She is frustrated with herself. She wants to ‚Äújust‚Äù relax. She wants to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but right now she can‚Äôt, physically and mentally, and there is no timeline at all for when those things will be possible. Be aware of language that society uses to trivialize mental illness and be the rock in her life that doesn‚Äôt judge, because anything society has said she‚Äôs said to herself x1000. She is lucky to have found someone willing to ask for help. 

Fourth, ask her if she would be comfortable bringing you into therapy sometimes. It may be a perspective for you that would help a whole lot and she may speak more freely because she clearly has a good bond with her therapist and trusts them. It could be that you guys need a mediator in order to communicate about some things. She has been programmed to survive in a way you haven‚Äôt and that envelops every.single. experience. I‚Äôm hopeful for you guys and I hope there‚Äôs someone out there like you for me.

Edit: something that helped me with my startle response was to set my phone to silent/vibrate and create a pattern that is unique and less startling. On iPhone it is settings -> sounds -> text tone -> vibration -> custom"

todayilearned,fphpccz,t1_fpggmgi,1588625338.0,It really depends on the varietal but most agave bloom between 8-15 years. 25 is the high end and although it is called the century plant it doesn‚Äôt actually get that old.

I definitely have a disordered relationship with food but in a much more roundabout way.

bartenders,ffmdgxe,t3_eu2kw6,1580052903.0,"I think it‚Äôs partially because of our higher drinking age. People don‚Äôt learn to drink at bars- they learn in college dorm rooms and stupid house parties where there is no such thing as a balanced drink and the sweeter the better. 4oz of gin with equal parts Diet Coke might make me hate gin too. People also don‚Äôt like to admit they don‚Äôt know something, so rather than take a chance on a thoughtful cocktail with ingredients they haven‚Äôt tried they just ask you to change it. You can turn these people around by saying your drinks are well balanced or ‚Äúthis one is super popular.‚Äù You hope that their friend who was more reasonable likes their drink enough to talk it up and make the second round a bit more respectful. 

Sometimes though you get a group of 40 year olds who have never tried anything other than vodka and you just make their boring drinks and move on with your life because they ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to drink and they don‚Äôt want a conversation."
