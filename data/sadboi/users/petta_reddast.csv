AskReddit,fpaxg4y,t3_gcebk2,1588457728.0,"Same as what everyone else has said in this thread. I get so angry and frustrated when I hear about men who feel that this is something they just need to accept. No. Abuse is abuse, no matter who’s doing it. Also find the whole «angry, violent girlfriend/wife» concept extremely toxic. I see it especially in cartoons and anime. It’s not funny, and I think it sends the wrong message to the kids who are watching these shows, messages that will stick with them as they grow and create this idea that women being violent towards their partners is okay or even entertaining. IT’S NOT. IT NEEDS TO STOP"
AskReddit,fpapqa4,t3_gc9d4v,1588453143.0,"How people don’t acknowledge the misogyny of Drag Queens, and keep on defending because «it’s sooo empowering and it’s about being yourself and self expression!» No it isn’t. Taking on a female persona and using she/her pronouns and acting out all the negative stereotypes of women and calling convinsing queens for «fishy» is stright up misogyny. I feel mocked and humiliated by watching them bitch at each other and saying vaginas smell like fish, not empowered. This is not what it means to be a woman."

Have fun!"

ATLA,fp5fpae,t3_gbekix,1588327674.0,"I loved LOK. As someone else mentioned it’s made for a bit more mature audience than ATLA, and I believe that is shown well in the villains. Ozai was very much the traditional bad guy, whereas the motives of the villains in LOK are more complex with grey areas.

I love both ATLA and LOK, but I don’t compare them. A lot of people do, and I believe it’s hard to do so because they are so different. So I would reccommend that you don’t compare them and make it into a competition. Enjoy them both for the great series that they are :)"

I do look forward to moving out. Need a job first, though -.-"
angry,fp59o11,t1_fp4f4t8,1588321219.0,"Then she can tell me that. She was a shitty mum when I grew up, screamed at me that I was brain damaged and that she was going to take me to the doctor to get my head checked becoause there was definitely something wrong with me, whenever I did something she didn’t like. Or just got the days of the week mixed up during summer holiday. 

I set her straight when I was 20, and I thought she was doing better. And so when she won’t tell me of an opening of assistant at the school she’s working at, but will gladly help her friend’s daughter get the job, all I’m hearing is «you’re brain damaged, you can’t do this job.» It’s not even a permanent thing, just for a few months. 3 months maximum. 

So yeah I’m pissed. Years of anger, not just this minor thing"
AskReddit,fp54vme,t1_fp41i9b,1588316379.0,"Endometriosis is not visible other than in surgery. So to get an official diagnosis, you need to have surgery. Doctors are unfortunately more often than not too uninformed, or do not take it seriously enough because women’s illness. Symptoms vary from woman to woman, but if you miss work every month because cramps I would say you have a strong argument to why you should get a diagnostic surgery, or try birth control. I would reccommend that you try birth control first and see if it works cause that surgery is no walk in the park. If you need it, have it, if you find other things that work, do that first.

Surgery is also only a temporary solution, as it will come back, you just never know when. Could be in 5 years, 5 months or 5 weeks. I had 6 blessed months after surgery. Now I’m on birth control which works most of the time."
AskReddit,fp3wwbj,t3_gb5fyn,1588287324.0,"Endometriosis. Before I had surgery and found medication that lessens the symptoms, I would vomit and almost pass out from pain. My entire body would be covered in sweat, every pore on my body would leak and it looked like I had gone for a swim. Would also lose all strength so moving would be difficult or even impossible. That’s hoe painful it was. I had to be drugged down on really strong pain killers for several days. It wouldn’t take away the pain, but it numbed my brain enough so that I would be able to deal with the pain.

Repeat every month for years, and if you are unlucky and no medication work, then this is your life now, until you die. There’s no cure. 1 in 10 women have this. Fun"
