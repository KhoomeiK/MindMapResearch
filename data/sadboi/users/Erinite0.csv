I am so frustrated at the attitudes of everyone around me who seem to think my concern is an overreaction. 

I've been waiting for permission to leave work for days now. My partner doesn't seem to see why I'm concerned he's still going to work as normal (travel, warehouse, furniture deliveries) when anything he gives me could then be given to literally anyone in my family and how since they're all 60+ and we live in one of the shittiest states with a local average age of too-old-for-this they could die due to care being unavailable. All I want is everyone to stay home as much as possible for a couple weeks. I don't see how that's an overreaction at all and I'm tired of being treated like a fool."
