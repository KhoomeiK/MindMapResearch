I was being mentored by someone who started as an assistant and eventually built her own consulting firm for human resources.

So yeah maybe it wasn't a career *yet*, but it took me years of applying to jobs and eventually talking to the right person to finally get my foot in the door into something that was more than retail.

Schizoid,fgpe07d,t1_ffyet8e,1581002894.0,"Hey, you are me and I am you. I struggle with knowing what to do hour to hour. I usually just did things that I assume normal well-adjusted people did, like hike or exercise. Or read or something. outside of working my basic grocery store job, I struggle intensely. I got through college because I had to. Got a degree in something I found interesting but had no clear goal or career in mind.

I found no therapist to be useful, and they typically float ideas that sound horrible to me instead of acknowledging where my feelings of discomfort come from. I did some exploring myself, and found that most of my discomfort comes not from the fact that I have no goals, or aspirations, but because of the way society views me for it. I feel horrible when I tell people I work at a grocery store, when I tell people I don't date, when I talk to my friends who are all well into their careers. It got so bad for me I thought I could uproot my life and move to the mountains. Did that for three years and the isolation killed me.

I've seen multiple therapists since, and I've gained nothing. I've tried CBT but it doesn't work because most of the time, I don't even have thoughts. And I've kicked all of my harmful/escapist behaviors (weed, alcohol, running away to new places) Instead I looked at myself inside, and at my circumstances and determined that the best thing for me to do at this point is to model myself after a well-adjusted person. I've recently started trying to pursue a career out of my degree and networked my way into meeting an HR consultant that is helping me flesh out my resume and get a career in HR. It's not what I want, but I really don't want anything. I'm just doing it so I can have a career and be a normal 9-5 human. That makes me feel slightly better, but I know I'll never be normal

My point is, you know yourself better than any therapist. Even if you don't think you do. It would take years of work for a therapist to get to know the real you so there's no shortcut. The only shortcut is to be your own ideal therapist. That takes work too, but some professional psychologists I've read have argued that self-therapy is the most effective form of therapy."

I wish I didn't know what it was like. I focused on myself for years and still have dreams of her. Haven't met anyone else since. It's so hard. Every day. Every fucking day she involuntarily pops up in my brain. Haven't even spoken to her since it all happened. I ruined it all when I started to slip into suicidal ideation. I told her about it. She had to leave, I would've left. I'd trade places with you if I could. It'll never get better than my early twenties, when I knew what love was. I hope when I die, I get to experience that again in some kind of afterlife. Otherwise...this whole thing is so scary...and pointless..."

Or is it helping you not pay attention to the issues for which you may not think you have a solution? /r/leaves is a good place to check out for support. I was a weed evangelist. Smoked every day for 7 years. One day something spoke to me, I don't know what or where it came from, but it helped me realize it was time. I can't say I'm any better. I can say I don't really miss it. I can say I can see clearer now that I have issues, and I need to face those issues head on. I need to find other ways, other forms of fulfillment. Maybe I'll go back to it some day when the deeper problems are resolved, weed will always be there. We won't. 

May I ask, do you still have dreams when you sleep? I think turning off dreams is pretty harmful to our psyches. And that's one thing weed did, stopped me from having any dreams for years. Now I dream every night, and it's not always comfortable. But they give me something to look at, to pick at, to let me know my subconscious is at work, doing...something...instead of hibernating.

I sound like a preacher, but you really will feel better after the first week. And hey, if you get past that hump and find you want to go back for whatever reason that's okay too. But give it a shot"

JoeRogan,f9rs0iu,t1_f9rqfgk,1575580470.0,"Yeah I think there's real issue with pushing something as a ""miracle"" diet or the ""ultimate"" diet, a panacea to everything. Firstly, that ideology is off-putting to people. People don't like being told what to do, or that what they're doing is wrong. The western diet is God awful, I know too many people who eat red meat every single day, and don't consider something a meal if it doesn't have meat in it. It's a cultural thing here...and I just think we could all do with a little less of it. A little more balance.

More greens and more fiber is highly beneficial. In fact high fiber diets are proven to decrease all kinds of chronic illnesses that plague the west, why don't we push that instead of pushing full on veganism?"

There's a short story written by the writer of Bojack Horseman literally called 'Move Across the Country' and it couldn't be more true to life. It's about a girl who moves because she's depressed, and the depression goes away for a while but one night she comes home and there it is, sitting at the dinner table just reading the newspaper. Waiting for you like it always was and will be. The only benefit to running away was now I know my depression and myself better than I did before, and I'm moving back to where I left with that knowledge I guess."
