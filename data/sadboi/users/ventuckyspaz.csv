MotoG,fqzulyq,t1_fqvbi6s,1589775778.0,I was actually able to get VoLTE working with the Stylus but it was a pain in the ass to get working. Motorola told me the phone wasn't compatible with Verizon which wasn't correct. I found out that the issue was that I had Verizon prepaid and since I had an unlocked phone it was blocking the VoLTE service. To get working I changed my service to regular post paid Verizon service so when I made calls it would allow voice over LTE service to get voice over LTE working. I noticed a week after I had this issue that an option was added on my phone to enable VoLTE under my settings so I'm guessing Motorola added this specifically after I raised the issue and this allows people to force the carrier to enable the service even if they have prepaid and it's not allowed. Either way the issue is stemmed from VoLTE not working when it should have been.
MotoG,fquqk3n,t3_gjxf8p,1589663059.0,My mom is still using my old G6 and it's working great for her. It's a solid phone for sure.
MotoG,fquol7e,t1_fqu60wz,1589662189.0,"This is why I like the Moto Stylus. It has 128GB storage, 4000 mah battery and good cameras (that can take pictures in darker places too). It comes with Android 10 so it will have 11 os update at some point. The display is brighter than the G7 and the selfie camera's position is much better. The stylus is pretty useless but I guess occasional usage can come in handy. I have Verizon so I couldn't use some of the other models and this phone supports CDMA. This phone is working very well for me. So basically you have this now for $300. I find the bezel slim looks really nice. Much happier with this over my G7 because I wasn't happy with its camera picture taking quality and it's nice to have the new operating system with the gesture navigating."
MotoG,fqumhrq,t1_fqtrbwz,1589661268.0,I have the Stylus so I guess it's different but I'm not having issues with it being slow and jittery. They have the same chipset and stuff so I imagine their performance would be similar. Benchmark tests show that they are similar to the A51 so I just assumed not having all of Samsungs extra UI and software installed would make the phone faster. Any phone that is midrange should be able to run smoothly. I do go I to developer options and change the animation scale to 0.5x and have done that with my last few android phones I believe that helps a lot with perceived speed.
MotoG,fqnaa0t,t3_ghjm6q,1589491329.0,"That's what I like about Motorola. Compare the Power/Stylus to the Samsung A51 and to me its no question which one is better. The most alarming complaint in the A51's reviews was how sluggish it's performance is. The chipsets in both phones are similar in performance but Samsung's phone will come bogged down with all their extra software/overlay while the Motorola will come with the the nice clean OS. I would have paid extra for the A51 but I was afraid of how sluggish it was going to be, how cluttered the interface is and I would miss doing the chopping motion to turn on the flashlight lol Motorola is able to do as much with better performance and at a cheaper price."
MotoG,fqn8xwf,t1_fqhrwvw,1589490675.0,"I had the same issue with my Motorola Stylus phone and the issue is voice over LTE. You can check this by when you go to make a call your LTE service drops to 1x mode and the moment you hang up it goes back to LTE. My issue was I had Verizon prepaid and Verizon doesn't allow VoLTE on unlocked phones with prepaid so to resolve it I had to convert my account to a regular post paid account. I couldn't receive phone calls half the time and when I did they cut in and out so I had to get VoLTE working or return the phone. Since then I noticed that Motorola updated the phone and added a setting that my G6 had which I believe will force the carrier to use VoLTE services. I would make sure this setting is on and if your phone still is going into 1X mode then contact your carrier and make sure VoLTE services is enabled for your account. If you have prepaid and are forced to upgrade your account Verizon was cool with me. I don't have good credit and they didn't require a deposit or anything but I did have a prepaid account with them for many years so I don't know if that factored in. Kind of sucks because it's almost $10 more bucks a month more than I was paying. Be interesting to see if that VoLTE setting actually works or not.

If you try to call Motorola don't even bother talking to whoever you first get just ask for tier two support. Even then they still were not helpful with this issue for me lol"
MotoG,fqn4p3t,t1_fqbccwr,1589488626.0,Hey I think I know what your guy's issues is. I was having the same problem and I have Verizon and the issue was I was using prepaid Verizon and when I made calls the phone wasn't using voice over LTE and was switching to radio to make the calls which resulted in really bad phone calls which barely worked. I couldn't receive calls half the time and when I did they kept cutting in and out. I found out that Verizon prepaid won't activate VoLTE with unlocked phones and I ended up having to switch my account to a post paid account. I think because of the issues I had which I worked with Motorola and Verizon on Motorola ended up adding a setting under network which you can manually enable VoLTE services to force the carrier to use VoLTE. I didn't have that as a setting so I had to switch my prepaid service to post paid or I was going to have to return the phone and wait to have to try to get the locked version from Verizon later if I wanted to use it with prepaid. Since they added that setting you should be able to enable it and it should fix your issues. If you enable it and make a phone call and it still goes into 1x mode then it's not able to override Verizon and the issue is what I was having. If you have a regular account it's possible you just need to call Verizon and enable VoLTE services on your account. I hope this helps.
MotoG,fqn0l6b,t3_gjckle,1589486649.0,"I have the G6, G7 and the new style and I noticed that the G6's camera was way better than the one that Motorola shipped with the G7 which is why I won't be ""upgrading"" my mom who has my G6 to the G7 because I want her to be able to keep having decent photo abilities."
MakingaMurderer,fqjh0p9,t1_fqh9vah,1589409829.0,"The confession was used by KK to poison the jury pool (with his ridiculous announcement of the details of the confession to the media) so it did its part without having to be used in the actual trial. The way he acted along with the detectives does raise alarm bells as to the legitimacy of the case. That's why there is even doubt. If there wasn't conflicts of interest, a bad history and stuff like this already exposed the evidence collected against SA would easily be enough to show he was guilty of murder. Since they were highly motivated to manufacture evidence against him as shown with BD's testimony it does put into question everything else in the case."
MotoG,fpwzwh6,t3_gesgcn,1588973036.0,"I have a stylus and so it's a similar phone and comes with a 10 watt charger also but will take a turbo charger input and charge at the faster current when you give it that. You can tell because when you plug it in the phone will tell you ""turbo charging"" on the clock/power widget on the home page. Motorola just went cheap with the adapter they shipped with the phone its better to use one that provides turbo charge voltage (15 watts or higher although the phone I believe only will take 15 watts)"
LGBDropTheT,fph046n,t3_gd7r99,1588612602.0,"I read that in my head and then said out loud ""ewww"" lol. Just nasty what do these trans activists think they are? Nope nope nope."
MotoG,fpgxgk1,t1_fpfgyrz,1588611250.0,I would try a factory reset. The phone should be a normal North American unlocked retail version from Motorola. Perferred network type is set to global? Hopefully it's not a special phone they sell to Google or something. If you factory reset and it still doesn't work that's bad news. Try calling Motorola if you haven't done so yet. 800-734-5870 and I would tell the guy you need tier two support because whoever picks up will just waste your time for a while until he gets you over to tier two.
MotoG,fpf0hh5,t3_gd226a,1588558954.0,"I think your issue is the power is available in CDMA/GSM or GSM only. If you got the ""international version"" and it can take two sims then it's not capable of working on Verizons network."
MotoG,fpbw61e,t1_fpbjsj8,1588480315.0,Yeah the gcams are great they really do help a lot.
MotoG,fpb8h3p,t1_fp9x78o,1588464357.0,Yeah try to take a picture indoor with it. I just got a stylus because I hated the camera on the G7. It's nice to be able to take decent pictures again.
MotoG,fpb89ca,t3_gc8hmw,1588464223.0,"I just got the Stylus specifically because I hated the camera on the G7 so much. It's not so bad when you are out in the sun and it's very bright but indoors it's a terrible camera. I also have the G6 which my mom is still using and its camera is way better. I don't know why I think the specs are similar. I was going to give her the G7 but I don't think I want to degrade her pictures. I doubt there is much you can do except running bootleg Google camera. Everything else about the phone is good I don't know what Motorola was thinking they could have spent a few more dollars on a decent camera for the phone. It's an important part of the phone. Reviews for the G7 didn't really stress how terrible the cameras are on it

Edit: OK to be fair I had a mama cat and some kittens living in the laundry room and there wasn't very good light in there and I was getting frustrated with the G7 ability to take pictures. Now I can take better pictures in low light."
verizon,fp0xi5o,t1_fp0w0cn,1588219159.0,"Oh OK I can only go off of the phones I have so then I can only assume it's because Motorola doesn't offer it as an option on their phones then. There is no option to enable it on the Moto G6, G7 or the Stylus."
verizon,fozivjf,t1_fozbw7l,1588191406.0,They said they don't allow VoLTE on unlocked phones on prepaid. My G6 had a setting under its options to apparently override it. I was not able to get VoLTE to work on my prepaid Verizon account. I tried everything I could to get it to work. The Verizon techs tried to get it enabled on my account but the system wouldn't enable it because of the type of account I had. When I converted my account it immediately worked. There is an option on the G6 to enable LTE communications. It seems to override the carrier settings. Or the carrier thinks the unlocked G6 is locked for some reason. I don't know. The cause was on Verizon's end and the solution was I couldn't use a prepaid account with an unlocked phone unless I wanted to make phone calls with archaic radio signals. I believe an unlocked phone can override the carrier but the manufacturer has to enable it in the settings and through programming. Both the Verizon and Motorola technicians were extremely unhelpful throughout all of this.
verizon,fozbmq5,t1_fozbg1v,1588187943.0,That's what I don't get what is Verizon going to do with all the people using unlocked phones on prepaid? It's fine I have a regular account now. They are going to have to figure something out which I predict will be to allow unlocked phones to use VoLTE anyways.
verizon,fozb8my,t1_foxb3o2,1588187757.0,"I converted my account from prepaid to postpaid and I was able to get VoLTE service. I just think Verizon should enable it on all phones and not make their prepaid customers open regular accounts. It's OK I'll just have to pay an extra 10 bucks more a month for the same service. Without VoLTE Verizon was forcing my phone to use CDMA to make phone calls which the signal was too weak to make in my bedroom. Now it's all good. My old Motorola phone was able to get better CDMA reception and the phone before that was able to force Verizon to use VoLTE.

Edit: Verizon doesn't allow WiFi calling period..."
MotoG,foz8t1u,t1_fooupn5,1588186594.0,I had a similar situation with Verizon prepaid. I got a Stylus and VoLTE wouldn't work on it. They wouldn't support unlocked phones but that didn't make sense because my G6 worked. The most I can make of it is that Motorola has a setting in the G6 which was able to override the carrier and force them to support VoLTE. Since the Stylus didn't have that setting to get it to work I was forced to convert my prepaid account to a post paid account. I have to pay ten more bucks a month but whatever. If the carrier is cool about it they will support unlocked phones. If they aren't cool they won't. I live up in the mountains so I have to use Verizon everyone else has much worse service. I would love to use a cheaper provider. Look into how much it would cost to covert your account maybe it wouldn't cost that much if you end up having one or two other people join your account.
MotoG,foz7x8r,t1_forw1ro,1588186174.0,I was considering switching to the A51 before I fixed my issue with VoLTE with my stylus and I'm actually glad I kept the stylus for the main reason that both phones basically have the same processing power. The power is the same too. The biggest complaint in reviews about the A51 is how sluggish it is in navigating and running programs. So the A51 is bogged down by a lot of software (Samsung apps and if you get it with a carrier their stuff) and struggles which the Motorola is free from. Since they get similar CPU and GPU scores to me means the Motorola wins because it's able to be quicker and it's a lot cheaper.
MotoG,foz6sn1,t1_fouj9w4,1588185638.0,My issue with the Stylus that I just dealt with was that I couldn't get VoLTE activated until I switched my prepaid Verizon account to a post paid account. My Moto G6 has a setting that apparently forces it to work on their network but my G7 and the Stylus (I would assume the power too) do not have that setting so its up to the carrier to give you support for VoLTE. I was told by Motorola's tech support that AT&T and Sprint would for sure enable VoLTE on the Stylus. I don't understand why Motorola wouldn't include the option like they did on the G6 to manually enable the mode to override the carrier. Anyways I live up in the mountains and have to stick with Verizon so I converted my account so they would allow my phone to access it with VoLTE.
verizon,foyn4hd,t1_fox9d9m,1588175509.0,They allow voice over LTE on their locked phones. If you have an unlocked phone you have to get one of their post paid accounts. It's ridiculous I'm trying to switch my account over now. I'm only doing this because my phone doesn't get enough reception in the bedroom to receive calls. It doesn't make sense because what's going to happen when they turn off CDMA? The stylus can't force the network to use VoLTE instead of CDMA so Verizon gets to bully you around on it. It's incredibly frustrating. There is no setting on the Stylus to force on VoLTE and Verizon refuses to turn it on for unlocked phones on prepaid accounts...
verizon,fox8dig,t1_fox842h,1588136644.0,Just wanted to know if I could somehow get an unlocked phone to get VoLTE on a prepaid Verizon account. I'm assuming it isn't possible.
MotoG,fowsf64,t1_fows7vx,1588126149.0,You have a setting for that on your Motorola Stylus phone? I don't have any VoLTE settings to change on my phone. Regardless they told me that unlocked phones can't get it on prepaid.
MotoG,fowqb8h,t1_fowpvl8,1588124909.0,There isn't a setting like that on my phone
MotoG,fowpac5,t1_fowp5x8,1588124326.0,They don't enable VoLTE on unlocked phones on Verizon prepaid. Unless you say how you did it I don't believe you.
MotoG,fowo34h,t1_fownplf,1588123636.0,Support told me they couldn't get the VoLTE service to work with an unlocked phone. They tried to get it to work multiple times. Unless you can say how you did it I'm going to assume that you didn't.
verizon,fowmr12,t1_fowm6kt,1588122855.0,Yeah it's Verizon that are being jerks about it. They should just enable it but they are being difficult because they want to force people into opening full accounts. I'm not sure my credit is good enough to be able to open an account. I couldn't even try because their system kept hanging up on me because I guess it was so overloaded or something.
MotoG,fowmkbb,t1_fowl7al,1588122749.0,Then you have a locked phone
MotoG,fowmiqg,t1_fowkst1,1588122724.0,Yeah I just wish the technicians knew that also they just kept trying to enable to service and didn't know any better. I guess they just have to make it difficult so people switch to a regular account. I wish they could just override it and make it work. Hell I would buy a locked version of the phone I'm staying with Verizon but I don't know if or when they will be releasing this phone. Oh well if I can't open a post paid account I'll just return the phone and give up.
MotoG,fowkicm,t1_foou5ej,1588121566.0,I finally figured this out today it's because I have a Verizon prepaid account they disable VoLTE with unlocked phones. Ridiculous but that's what I have to deal with. I'm gonna try to convert my account to a post paid account but the system was so overwhelmed today sales just kept hanging up on me.
MotoG,fowkcei,t1_foosucw,1588121472.0,It's because I have Verizon prepaid it doesn't support VoLTE with an unlocked phone. I have to switch to a post paid account to get it to work.
MotoG,fowk9aa,t1_fooxia4,1588121422.0,I figured it out it's because I have a Verizon prepaid account and they don't support VoLTE on unlocked phones. I have to switch to a post paid account to get it working correctly. Somehow the technicians kept trying to enable the service and it took multiple tries for me to figure it out because my sister's Sim card worked and she has the regular service. I don't understand how it's going to work when they discontinue CDMA later on in the year. I guess all the unlocked phones on prepaid don't work anymore.
verizon,fowjw4s,t1_fowijis,1588121215.0,OK I'm just curious what is going to happen with all the unlocked phones on Verizon prepaid when cdma is not available anymore?
verizon,fowifn5,t1_fowi615,1588120399.0,What are they going to do when they get rid of CDMA? Does that mean no unlocked phones can be used with prepaid? I don't know if I will pass the credit check which is why I've always stuck with prepaid and it's always worked well for me. It's aggravating that they can't just unlock this feature. It should just be enabled on all their phones regardless of locked status. If I could get this phone locked from Verizon I would where I live Verizon has the best service.
MotoG,fop5z6o,t1_fop4yiy,1587953826.0,I'm being told that voice over LTE should work so I'm going to talk to Motorola tomorrow and ask to talk to their advanced support and get them to send out a replacement phone. I think the guy I talked to today told me incorrect information.
MotoG,fooxia4,t1_fooxai7,1587948552.0,No I don't have it figured out. If there is anything you can suggest I would like to try it. What could I try with the stylus to get it to work?
MotoG,foowwd1,t1_foowr8c,1587948183.0,I'm using the Sim with my G7 now. There is no reason why the Sim can't be switched between different phones it wasn't an issue before. I tested it to make sure my VoLTE service worked and it does.
MotoG,foowppg,t1_foov6x1,1587948073.0,Why Verizon? They deleted the device and had me add it back in. Motorola told me false information today. Shouldn't I call Motorola back? As far as I can tell I have a defective phone.
MotoG,foowiz6,t1_foovr4t,1587947961.0,I was able to pop out the same Sim card from my G6 and out it in my G7 and it worked fine. Then when it didn't work correctly with the stylus I went and got a new one from the Verizon store. I then talked to Verizon on the phone for hours where they deleted the Sim card and had me load the phone back into the network fresh. I really doubt the issue is on Verizons end. If it's anything the phone is malfunctioning.
MotoG,footmc2,t1_foorubm,1587946202.0,I talked to them on the phone or I would but the guy basically told me that I would have to switch carriers to be able to have that feature. I had a feeling something was up with the phone because it wasn't getting as good of reception as my G6 or G7 in the same area. OK I feel better I'll call them back and ask to get a replacement after asking to talk to someone higher up in their tech support department.
MotoG,foospw5,t1_foornlp,1587945656.0,I already got a new sim that isn't the problem and I know my service works with it but I'm just annoyed that the Motorola tech would just tell me that the phone isn't compatible with VoLTE when it is because I want to keep the phone. I'd rather they send me a replacement if anything.
MotoG,foosew1,t1_foos1q4,1587945473.0,"We deleted it and registered it fresh to the stylus that isn't the issue. The Motorola technician told me today that the phone didn't support VoLTE on Verizon network so that's when I thought I was going to give up. The phone seems to be broken or something. It drops to 1x mode and then won't receive calls after I make or receive a call. I think I might try getting a replacement phone but I'm afraid of getting a new phone and having it do the same thing.

Edit: Verizon's website does say it supports it so I'm going yo call Motorola back and ask them about it I'm the morning like what's the deal with that."
MotoG,fooowhr,t1_fonsw8o,1587943365.0,I already did that it is activated for sure. The service works when I put the Sim card in my G7. I put it in the stylus and when I make a phone call the mode drops into 1x until I get out of the call and the internet doesn't work.
MotoG,fooojnj,t1_foo8rda,1587943155.0,Then why does the service work fine in my G7 but doesn't in the stylus? Did they send me a bad phone?
MotoG,fooob5m,t1_foo6hsv,1587943016.0,No it's not. I went through all of this with Verizon and Motorola. My sim card works fine with VoLTE on my G7 and when I put it in the stylus it doesn't work. I got the Motorola technician to tell me that the stylus doesn't support it on Verizon's network. I'm just warning you guys that I think it's shitty for Motorola to say that it supports Verizon's network when it doesn't fully support it. I like the Stylus and would prefer to keep it. It doesn't get as good of a signal as my G6 or G7 does. Probably just having to do with Verizon's network. I had Verizon try deleting and adding the phone back and I for sure have the service enabled on my account.
MotoG,foonwam,t1_foolgf2,1587942771.0,Yeah Motorola said it will work with Sprint or AT&T but not Verizon. If I lived in the city I would just switch carriers but I live in an area where Verizon gets the gets the best service.
LGBDropTheT,fohjhuy,t1_fog6vhn,1587766996.0,Yup I might be gay but because I'm a white non-trans man it cancels out my sexuality and I am seen as an oppressor so it works in the opposite way lol
Coronavirus,fnlugok,t3_g2e9tm,1587059927.0,I think Sweden is going to show that their approach to the virus was the correct one. The fatality rate of the virus will eventually be established to be much lower once it gets through the general population and likely won't be much higher than the flu. They will show that you didn't have to strip peoples civil rights away and destroy your economy because the virus wasn't nearly as dangerous as the models initially projected it to be. Already we have seen the numbers adjusted way lower than what they used to advocate shutting down the entire country. We were told all the hospitals would be overrun even with shutting down the country which did not happen. It's unfortunate what is going on in NYC but the media is still making people hysterical and unreasonable about the virus and they aren't educating them about the revised numbers. Sweden and the other states that didn't lock down will show that it wasn't needed to do this that social distancing and sensible steps were enough to control the virus.

relationship_advice,fn2d27l,t3_fyjy9t,1586584848.0,No don't reveal information that you weren't supposed to know. As an IT professional it's your job to keep confidentiality even if it would feel right to expose a douchebag and his mistress. Why risk your job and create unneeded drama at your workplace? Pretend like you never saw that correspondence. Maybe save the screenshots incase you need them for leverage but really if you were in a position to use them it would make you look as bad as they are because besides using them to rat somebody out you would be using them as blackmail. Why do you feel compelled to do something wrong yourself? I would question your own motives strongly before taking any actions and that the risks to yourself are really worth it.

LGBDropTheT,fleirn7,t1_fle3ob8,1585085186.0,Um also they pretend they have a vagina by calling their dicks their girldicks and they try to gaslight everyone around them to accept this even pressuring and sexually harassing lesbians into having sex with them because they get off on it but they also get off on getting everyone else to accept this delusion as fact. It's insanity and liberals have gone off a cliff in accepting all this in the name of being woke and social justice and stuff. What really bothers me is that the left will put the rights of trans people above everyone else's rights especially women and gay rights. Like everyone's rights are equal and we should all be treated the same.
relationship_advice,fl8opqh,t3_fn950l,1584928615.0,Be direct with him. Don't miss this opportunity and regret it later you will beat yourself up over it for the rest of your life. Tell him how you feel. The worst he can say is he doesn't have mutual feelings and you will know to stop but what could hopefully happen is that he has feelings back for you and something really great could come from it. Take a chance. The time is now. The Coronavirus has upended all of our lives and it has brought the two of you together for a reason. Take the opportunity you won't regret it however it turns out.
relationship_advice,fl85x8d,t1_fl7i1d6,1584916551.0,"I wasn't saying that trans people are fraudulent. What I was saying was that a trans person misleading someone to think they were seeing a non-trans person up and until the moment they reached into their pants is super messed up. That is way more dangerous for them to do than to be open about it. I wasn't saying trans people aren't the gender they identify as but it's ridiculous to expect people are not going to have an issue with finding the opposite genitalia than what the person is presenting as. It's extremely misleading to not be open about this from the beginning. Some people might like or prefer trans but it's up to them to decide that not to discover it right when they are about to have sex. Screaming ""transphobia"" isn't going to work anymore because its been way overused to suppress reasonable opinions and used way too often period. Trans people's rights do not supersede over everyone else's rights."
relationship_advice,fl7hbhm,t1_fl70eu7,1584901734.0,"Yup because transsexuals get to do anything they please because if you don't let them you might get smeared as a ""transphobe"" which is really scary since now most of the world is labeled as such. Don't want to allow your friend to sexually assault you? What a transphobe!"
relationship_advice,fl7h14h,t1_fl7f22v,1584901562.0,Yeah you're right it's worse than that. To mislead someone about who you are is fraudulent and really fucked up. Someone who is trans needs to make that clear to the person they are going out on a date or hooking up with. I'm a gay guy also and if I was with a guy and I put my hand down there and I didn't find a penis I would flip the fuck out also. It's very messed up to mislead people like that and no it's not transphobic to have requirements about what genitals a person has. Telling people that they are bigoted for their sexuality is erasing their sexuality and is homophobic.
LGBDropTheT,fiz9ght,t1_fix9rrq,1582857292.0,"Which is ironic since most Latinos hate when people use ""Latinx"" especially when it's coming from a politician and it seems like they are just pandering to identity politics. How are you supposed to pronounce ""Latinx"" anyways? This obsession about gender gets really old."
LGBDropTheT,fiz93s7,t1_fiy3ac8,1582857059.0,"I refuse to use the word. We should all make it a point to not use it or maybe use (non-trans) instead.  I'm not a ""cis gay guy"" I'm a ""gay guy"" who doesn't need to specify that I'm not trans because the majority of gay guys aren't trans and if someone is one they can add the qualifier we shouldn't have to. Seriously fuck that word."
itsafetish,fisyp96,t3_f9fk8i,1582697513.0,Gee I wonder why lesbians are running away screaming from transpeople and want to be totally separated from them LMAO
LGBDropTheT,fibgde1,t1_fiajx8v,1582321373.0,They think they can bully us gay men into having sex with transmen but it isn't happening. We don't care what we are labeled and we have dealt with social stigma plenty in our lives so attacking us with another label or two isn't going to convince us to do something we are 100% against. I fully support a transgenders person's right to be free and do whatever they want to do in life. That doesn't mean I have to deny what their physical sex characteristics are or I have to change my preferences in any way to accommodate them for any reason. I'm not ever having sex with anyone who has or had a vagina. I haven't ever in my life and I'm not about to start. I don't care how much they look like a man that doesn't matter to me I do have genital preferences which are not negotiable.
LGBDropTheT,fg4iwn3,t3_ewgpzw,1580504179.0,Sounds good to me!
LGBDropTheT,fg4ihd4,t3_ewfbhw,1580503925.0,Ha gay men don't play that game at all. I'm just like nope I like men WHO HAVE PENISES. If that makes me a bigoted homosexual I'm perfectly fine with that. Maybe that's why the trans community hates gay men so much. We know what we like and can't be pressured or shamed into having sex with someone we aren't sexually turned on by (part of it is we can't hide our reaction or lack of it like women can). Lesbians need to keep calling that shit out and put an end to it. Totally creeps me out too.
GenderCritical,fg0wjs0,t3_evvdem,1580416424.0,I'm a leftist myself and I can have good solid political discussions with people from all over the political spectrum. That said it seems to me that people on the left have a hard time being reasonable and calm while discussing a subject matter with someone they are in disagreement with. Take Trump for instance. I'm not a Trump supporter at all whatsoever but I don't hysterically hate the man either. I'm able to have a political conversation with a Trump supporter without freaking out. I can discuss things like abortion and guns with someone I have a disagreement with and still respect their point of view and understand why they have it. I'm not saying people on the right don't have issues having political discussions but I find in general it's much easier to talk with them about politics even though I disagree with them on way more stuff than I do with liberals. It's weird. Maybe because a conservative isn't trying to change my mind. Or maybe the left has gone bat shit insane.
GenderCritical,fg0qwic,t1_ffyggh4,1580413261.0,This gay man stands with his lesbian sisters. We just need to hang in there and stay grouped together. What the trans community is doing to women is extremely disturbing. Trans people treat women's rights like they are worthless and that women are a lower class of people. Women didn't fight this hard for equal rights to have men in dresses trample all over them and demand to have their lady dicks sucked. The madness needs to stop and it only will if more of us takes a stand and call out what they are doing.
LGBDropTheT,fg0ch9n,t3_evui7h,1580404892.0,"I'm a guy who likes guys who have penises. Why this is a scandalous statement for either of us to make in 2020 is completely insane. I agree with you I will never find a ""guy"" with a vagina sexually attractive. I've never have done anything sexual with a vagina and they gross me out. I'm not about to start I don't care how ""male"" or masculine the person they are attached to.  I also wouldn't care for a ""woman"" with a penis. Why the transgender community thinks they can guilt or shame us into having sex with them is wrong in so many ways. Shame on them we need to strongly push back on this. They should be treated as separate categories as normal genders. Nobody wants to go into female nudes and see a dick or male nudes and see a vagina. It's crazy that they get all offended at the idea that we get offended about their attempts at forcing us to play along with their mental illness. Glad I found this group makes me feel a little more sane."
detrans,ffssh2s,t3_eiblx4,1580190821.0,I'm sorry that you were treated this way. I know this post is old but I hope you have had luck making new friends. One who accept you exactly as you are not what they want you do be for themselves. This transgender stuff has gotten really out of control. You're a really brave person please hang in there. If you're in the San Bernardino area let me know.
LGBDropTheT,ffgzdqn,t1_ffdzk5v,1579918989.0,Bingo you just summed it up why it's so fucked up. Ugh so disturbing I'm glad I found this group.
LGBDropTheT,ffgyifz,t1_ffdtbrw,1579918340.0,I don't care anymore. I'm not going to be afraid of being attacked by them. You're labeled a bigot if you think it's unfair for trans women to compete against biological women in sports competitions. It's obviously totally unfair and they want to scream at everyone and attack them. A big backfiring is happening. Have you guys ever checked out /r/truscum ? It's an interesting perspective from transsexuals and their dislike of the transgender movement. They feel the same way we do.
LGBDropTheT,ffgy0s8,t3_et2rse,1579917976.0,"This is a fantastic example of why we need to cut ourselves off from the trans movement (who stuck us together with them in the first place?). They are literally insane. They can call us all the names they want I'm never sucking a girl dick or eating out a mangina. I'm a man who likes men who present as men and have actual penises. I can't believe this statement has to be made so specifically and I'll be labeled a bigot for having my ""preferences"" which aren't ""preferences"" they are requirements. Trans people are smearing gay people as bigots because we won't have sex with them. Disgusting."
LGBDropTheT,fe9p0h8,t3_enzze9,1578940179.0,"There can be 5,758 genders but I am a cis gay man (sorry to use that stupid term cis but not sure what else to use) who is only attracted to other men who have a penis. It is a requirement of mine. I don't care if a transgender person labels me a bigot for that or whatever. I don't do anything sexual with anyone who has a vagina. It doesn't matter how they present. I am not attracted to anyone who is feminine or looks like a woman. This would leave me to men with penises who look like men. I guess what I'm saying is for me there are two genders and I'm 100% homosexual."
LGBDropTheT,fe9lbkp,t3_eo6131,1578939030.0,I don't get it. I'm a guy who likes guys and I'm masculine and I only like wearing guys clothing and I hate makeup. I would have a far easier time finding a guy as I am now than if I dressed up as a woman LMAO I don't understand the transgender agenda. Do they really convince gay men to dress as women that they would have an easier time attracting men and what fit into society? I've always known I was gay 100% since I was a little kid. I've always been totally comfortable with the gender/sex I was born into so this notion that because someone is gay that they can be gender fluid or something is insulting because it's not the case for many (probably most) of us. A few of my gay friends like to cross dress for fun but that's about the extent of it. It's not to escape gender dysphoria and they aren't adopting that identity or something. They all like being guys too. It's why we are gay men. We like being guys and being with guys.
truscum,fe950u1,t1_fdy3qxy,1578934289.0,I'm a gay cis man (hate using the term cis just seems like it was made to be an insult or something) who feels extremely disillusioned with the transgendered movement enough to just want nothing to do with them and I'm really glad I came across this group because I didn't know what the difference between transgendered and transsexual was before and comments like yours help me realize there is an entire group of transsexuals who also feel the same way about the transgender stuff also. Having 458 genders and announcing to everyone your pronouns is getting really old. Now I see movements breaking off the T from LGB and what's going on with this group. Very interesting. It's been really insightful reading the posts in this group and getting a better understanding of what's going on. I have cross dressing friends but they don't identify as the other sex and I have a friend who is fully transitioned (well except for downstairs) who would never refer to herself as trans. She is a girl and looks/sounds like a girl. I don't have a good feeling where all of this is heading. I think what the transgender community is doing is endangering all of us.
antidepressants,fdo3zy9,t1_fdm0w84,1578598483.0,The maximum dose is 450 mg which I feel is ineffective but because when they first released the drug with much higher dosages and it caused a couple of seizures in people with eating disorders the FDA forced them to reduce the prescribing limits to get approved. I think the drug should be approved in higher dosages than 450 mg but you won't find a doctor who will do it.
depressionregimens,fddtesx,t1_fdai7e9,1578323509.0,Wellbutrin doesn't reuptake serotonin so it wouldn't be dangerous at all.
depressionregimens,fddtctv,t3_ek4jht,1578323469.0,Me and my doctor added Cymbalta to my usual 450 mg of Wellbutrin because of anxiety I was having and it was like a synergistic boost to it. I'm guessing the reuptake of norepinephrine of both meds works really well together. Something to consider. Now I think Cymbalta works better than Wellbutrin does for me.
depressionregimens,fddsyif,t3_ekhbua,1578323183.0,I don't understand why so many people go on Effexor instead of Cymbalta. I've had really good luck with a Cymbalta/Wellbutrin combo I hope this help you out.
antidepressants,fc9ym6m,t3_eg7u34,1577560156.0,I'm male in my late 30s and on Cymbalta and Wellbutrin and I would agree with this.
antidepressants,fc9xchu,t3_egm8b5,1577559602.0,You're becoming a hypochondriac by reading all this stuff. If you aren't having any issues with the medication and are having good results with it you shouldn't change anything. Going off the medication could cause disaster to happen. You should read up on what happens when someone who is successfully medicated decides to then stop their medication what typically happens when they do that. It's always good to educate yourself about what medications you are on and their side effects but you're creating a problem out of something that wasn't there in the first place. Zoloft is a good drug it's the most potent SSRI on the market and it also has some reuptake on the dopamine receptors which helps with its efficiency. If it's working well for you then why go off of it? Their effects on testosterone is very small and the benefit you get with having you mood boosted and regulated is huge you should remember there are pros and cons to everything and this includes if you do decide to stop taking a medication that has been working well for you.
antidepressants,fc9wbp3,t3_egp9o4,1577559149.0,"I understand I've tried many of them also over the years. I'm actually having good luck with Cymbalta right now in combination with Wellbutrin. So far at least. You should move on to TCAs and MAOIs if you have tried all of those and they haven't worked out. Here read this article.

CatastrophicFailure,fc9khyd,t1_fc7s62j,1577554006.0,I suppose I'm glad I live in the mountains where when we get fog people can't possibly go that fast but some do try to maintain 35+ on a curvy road when it's more appropriate to stay at 20-25 incase there is an object or a car stopped in the road and you need to suddenly hit your brakes. I don't think people going so fast in the fog consider that there could be stopped traffic in the middle of the road. They think if they can stay in their lane they can maintain whatever speed they can get to.
AskReddit,fbxve2y,t1_fbxk3s2,1577201514.0,I have multiple friends who came out later in their lives and ended up leaving their wives and moving on to relationships with men. It wasn't that they became gay they always were but felt pressured and had an expectation to marry and have children by their parents and society at large. It's sad that had to happen and they had to go through that process later in life instead of being able to come out as who they were earlier in life.
AskReddit,fbxv6yb,t1_fbxnmv1,1577201368.0,Great statement although I didn't need to test the water myself. 100% gold star homosexual here. I mean I've made out with women before and I fingered one once but I know for a fact that I don't like women sexually. I have never had a sexual thought about one my entire life and haven't had actual sex with one nor do I want to ever try it. Some of us really are not on the spectrum but at least for me I recognize that I'm probably the exception and not the rule since most people are going to be what you explained so eloquently here.
antidepressants,fbx31h4,t1_fbgblvb,1577167350.0,That's not true. I have no sexual side effects with Prozac or Cymbalta but terrible side effects with Paxil or Effexor. Just because one drug of a particular class gives a certain side effect doesn't mean all the other ones from that class will give the same side effect. Of course there is a high likelihood of it but how the serotonin gets reuptaked seems to matter to sexual function to each individual person.
antidepressants,fbx2jc8,t3_edt7bx,1577166805.0,I've been on many different SSRIs and also Effexor which didn't work well for me and I've had a lot of luck with Cymbalta. I'm taking it for my severe anxiety and it seems to be helping a lot. You should give it a shot if the other SSRIs haven't worked. The next things to try are TCAs and MAOIs.
antidepressants,fbx13xx,t1_fbwtzi0,1577165377.0,My best luck has been with Cymbalta which I'm on now. It's dramatically reduced my anxiety levels over any of the other SSRI or the other SNRI Effexor that I have tried in the past.
antidepressants,fbt1cwu,t3_ee9bke,1577065708.0,Zoloft actually has an effect on dopamine and reuptakes it in a small amount especially in doses of 100 mg or higher. It's the strongest serotonin reuptake inhibitor but I'm guessing it's effect on dopamine helps reduce the sexual side effects and might have effects like what is happening to you.

bipolar,fbk37r8,t1_fbhwq4d,1576944095.0,OK good you need to show the insurance company you tried a generic alternative before doing Latuda. I actually had to have my pharmacy send in the request and have it turned down before being able to have my psychiatrist send in the request for authorization. Blue shield approved it no problem. I had a $75 copay after that (for what shows as a $1599.99 drug!) but I got a couple card from the manufacturer which then lowered the cost to $15 a month you should get this from them which they email to you and your pharmacy adds like it's a second insurance card. It's a must have for anyone especially once the new years hits and pharmacy deductibles get reset.
bipolar,fbjvxjv,t3_edpumo,1576940902.0,A GP is just fine to see if you are already on a medication regimen and just need them to prescribe refills. Besides that they are not going to be able to help much with new meds or starting a new regimen. Someone who is perhaps depressed could go to a GP and get away with being thrown on an antidepressant but someone with bipolar should really try to stick with a psychiatrist unless they really have no other options.
