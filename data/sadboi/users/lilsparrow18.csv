LearnJapanese,fp13nkk,t1_fp0pueh,1588223509.0,"The reason why the translation isn't ""Please try to watch this anime"" is because it sounds less natural in English, and doesn't carry the same meaning as the Japanese sentence. Learning the different parts of a Japanese sentence is useful in learning the functions of each part, but when actually translating between two languages - any language - the translations are always made natural.

And with お勧める, while it is correct, it is more formal. And personally, when I have seen Japanese people use that kind of word, they use the noun お勧め (meaning 'reccomendation', often in hiragana too). Also, the honorific お is usually used before 勧め I've noticed. 

For example: 

近くにお勧めのレストランがあれば教えてくれませんか?

Could you recommend me a restaurant nearby?

So when people do use お勧め•る, that's how I usually see it used.

Like the other commenter said, using チェックする seems a bit more casual, and has a feeling of ""check out"", and might be used more in day to day conversation, like with people you know a little bit more.

And why 見る isn't used to recommend something? It isn't really necessary, because by simply recommending something, regardless of what we specify the action to be, whether it's for eating, reading or whatever, we still know that something is being recommended to us, and that's all we need. If we want someone to try something, we could say
さしみを食べてみて下さい、この本を読んでみて下さい, and these would translate as ""please try eating sashimi"" or ""please try reading this book"". When using チェックする, it specifically means check out, and if we said, ""please try to check this out"", it could be referring to anything to check out. And this would be the direct translation, that's basically a long way of saying ""I recommend (trying) this"". 

In the Japanese sentence, you probably could force verbs like watch or read or anything in the sentence, but IN THE JAPANESE SENTENCE it doesn't sound natural because there's a lot going on already in the sentence, and we get what's going on already anyway, so it just ends up sounding a bit awkward. In English we can say, ""I recommend you watch this anime"", but it's expressed differently in Japanese. And you'll find this with a lot of things. They are two different languages so things don't just line up every time, and you'll see this more often with more complex sentences - so what you can do is learn all the grammatical forms of Japanese to understand the nuances in their language, rather than basing it off English and then you'll understand more why they express things the way they do.

Also, I should add, that in Japanese there are a couple of ways to express the idea of ""trying"", but ~てみる specifically refers to trying something out, without knowing how it's going to turn out, like trying something new or something you're unsure about.

So yeah, dissecting the sentence, you've got:

チェックして - check out

みて - try out

ください - please

So in English the most natural way to express this would be to say something like, ""I recommend trying this out"", or ""I recommend this"", or ""please try this out"" though that last one sounds a little less natural. But they all express the same idea as naturally as possible IN ENGLISH.

Kind of like how a word can gain additional meaning over time due to what has become mainstream, like 'literally'. But et al isn't really used outside of unis and the like, so it's stayed the way it's supposed to be.

She's trying to cater to you to make sure you're ok and not have to feel guilty for making you worried. So that you can cater to her, what you need to do to stop the possibility of her being able to do something like that is rather than ask her things, tell her things!

Dysphoria is complicated, and a lot of it is self perception, but also how other people perceive you. Like others have said, rather than ask her these questions, (because if you know she's dysphoric, that in and of itself should tell you she's not happy with her body in that moment anyway) you should tell her that YOU think she's cute and beautiful, and that YOU love her and are there to support her in those moments, and maybe hug her and tell her it'll be ok. Don't say anything you don't mean, because YOU lying would hurt her too, but just be supportive and reassuring. Ask her if she needs anything, or if she just needs a hug. I think she'd appreciate that. 

When someone is dysphoric, sometimes they might want affirmation and reassurance, but other times they might not even want to think about their body at all, so asking them to reflect on their body by saying, ""do YOU think you're cute"" might make them even more hyper aware of their body and what they don't like about it. 

Something else I do with my partner is ask them what things they'd like to try out with me, or I suggest things, like whether they'd like to get their nails painted, or try some new facial care, or look at new clothes together. Or I'd tell them what style of hair I think would suit them really well and how that makes them really cute. That kind of thing can be fun and lift up the mood and make your partner excited, though it's different for everyone.

I think in this situation you could've gone about it better, that's all. I'm sure your partner doesn't hold it against you, but try to understand why how you went about it might've made it harder for them to be honest with you.

I suffer from PTSD, and I too have triggers which to other people wouldn't bother them, but set me off into full on flashbacks, strong dissociation, and massive anxiety. Even so, it doesn't give me an excuse to be an entitled asshole to other people. I have to manage myself and let other people know things prior to certain situations, or if something arises, the moment it's an issue just get it out before I get to a point of no return. I don't want to treat anyone like shit just because I have a stupid disorder

Rather than the sister cracking the shits in an entitled way, if this is the case, she should've said in a particular way that she'd appreciate them not being so affectionate with each other even if they're letting her stay there, for reasons she doesn't want to talk about. She wouldn't even need to say that it's for reasons that she doesn't want to talk about, as long as she said it with the right tone. As a sister, the older one should catch onto it and drop it, maybe see if she's ok at another point in time. 

I said in another comment about how the sisters should talk about why it bothers her so much, and see if it's a case of immaturity and entitlement or if there's something deeper than that that needs to be addressed. But we can't sit around assuming every person who can't deal with a particular situation has some kind of OCD or trauma, because more often than not, that's not the case. If you have trauma, you have to be able to manage it somehow, and not be a dick to the people around you because the world doesn't revolve around you, and it's unfair on them too. That's why I think the sister could've handled herself better regardless, it was immature either way. And somehow I doubt this case has to do with trauma - if she can spit out sassy shit like ""save it for the bedroom"" or ""gross"" then I think she was 'calm' enough emotionally to conduct any trauma matters better than she did.

It's not like they were eating each other's faces or fucking right in front of her - it was basic leaning on shoulders or light hugging. So what.

I don't know how much Japanese you've learnt, but considering most of your experience has been with European languages, Japanese might throw you off the bend at first considering the sentence order being SOV rather than SVO, and the particles which take some time to get used to.

And also, if when you say Chinese, that she also speaks Chinese, then due to her knowledge of hanzi characters and depending on which Chinese language she speaks, there are overlaps in Japanese, particularly with the onyomi words. I was in a Japanese class with primarily Chinese people, and due to their background they had less trouble memorising vocab because ""ohhhh x sounds like y""

Some super intelligent people would be able to go far, but it would take LOADS of work.

Yes it would SUCK to not have as much sex, but sex isn't always a spontaneous thing that happens, it's not always hot and just happens, sometimes you just have to suck it up and ask, and when you get to business you enjoy it.

If you have at least a decent grasp on useful grammar points as well, you could install something like Hello Talk and make some friends on there. Just be careful who you talk to obviously because while most people are nice that I've talked to, there are some weirdos.

I was fortunate to, when I hit highschool, learn Japanese, though it was only in the past couple of years that I learnt stuff because I'd studied so much in my own time. We learnt some pretty frequently used kanji relevant to topics we did, like talking about ourselves, family, daily routine, stuff like that. So that's been useful, and is a good foundation. But outside of that, nowadays I use kanji when texting my Japanese friends and over time I've come to recognise a lot more. Plus the texting in general is great practice. Plus, on Hello Talk there's a transliteration feature so that solves kanji reading issues as well. But if you do want to learn how to better read and recognise kanji and all of their readings (writing simple ones is good so you can break down parts of characters, plus stroke order is pretty easy to pick up, but otherwise it's not that important), you could use WaniKani. A lot of people on this sub talk about it, and I personally have used it and it's pretty good.

There weren't tons of resources for me to look at, and I just went googling like a mad man until I found stuff and I studied every single day for hours. People are so dependent on other resources, or GUIDES - be it programs, courses or people, but if you're gonna learn a language you have to take some initiative and learn what works best for you. It's a hard skill to develop but my god it pays off.

I'm currently majoring in Japanese to become a Japanese teacher and it bothers me so much seeing people who don't put in any work and expect results. Learning a language is hard and requires dedication. When I do complete my degree and start teaching, I'm more than happy for people to come to me with questions - I'd be a teacher after all - and at least they're taking the initiative to ask, maybe some guidance on where to go next. But as far as actually ACTING on the responses they get, that's where they're on their own. You have to practice by yourself and put what you learnt into writing, and if you find a concept or little thing you don't quite understand, research it as much as possible. Everyone learns differently, and studying on your own, not from a teacher or any course teaching content in a very particular way can let you find what works best for you.

unpopularopinion,fl942z0,t3_fn9o4y,1584940357.0,"TWO people should want a child to keep it. And if they find out they're pregnant, then it most certainly should be discussed and the woman shouldn't withhold the information and think on it by herself before consulting her partner (unless she was in a dangerous situation for some reason). 

After discussing it, ultimately the woman doesn't want it and he does, she certainly shouldn't have to be an incubator for 9 months unless she is willing to have the baby and give it up for adoption - or, alternatively, even split with the guy and give him the kid to raise. Though somehow I have a feeling people don't do that, which is bullshit imo if they're going through with the pregnancy. 

I don't like the idea of abortion, but what the body goes through for that time is insane - it's something only women go through and it's their choice if they want to go through that. The man unfortunately would have to go along with the loss, and that is hard, but I think the woman goes through more in this situation.

After discussing it, and finding out the dad doesn't want it, they could split and she have the child, but he shouldn't have to bear parental responsibility, nor pay for the child. 

The most difficult situation arises if the dad simply doesn't want the child to exist at all, to have any tie at all, knowing his biological child exists - especially for a guy not even wanting children in the first place. And I totally understand that, and think that's a fair point for anyone to make. This is where I think, while hard for the woman, she'd have to go through the loss, and if she really wants a child so badly, she should find a different partner because of conflicting views on a really life changing event, where ideally you need support from both sides. 

It is HER body, but by having an abortion, while the loss of the child is traumatic, the body itself doesn't go through anywhere near as much as it would through pregnancy. The argument people make for women having a right to abortion is that it's their body their choice, and that pregnancy and childbirth can be horrible, but here they're not going through that. So that's why I think it's different here, and the man gets the say. Again, if she wants a kid, go find a different partner.

If both want the kid, all is good. 

If neither do, then use proper contraception, don't use abortion as a contraception because that is fucking insane."
unpopularopinion,fl7eas3,t1_fl79d2m,1584899969.0,"That's what my mum did!! She broke my family apart and my whole family, being the way they were always treated me differently because I was my mum's kid. I was the black sheep, and every time my mum sent abusive messages to my dad, he'd argue with my step mum, and then he being a mama's boy always went to talk to my grandparents about everything, and then they'd all blame me for what my mum did and I was just a kid. They would scream at me for talking to her or telling her ANYTHING, ANY of my struggles, anything at all, and would make me promise not to talk to her. But things were hard and I couldn't talk to anyone, and my mum with her honeyed words would make me feel like I could talk to her, and I'd be screaming no, but I had no one else to go to. She was the best I had. And it always backfired

What made me cut her off, was when I was staying at my grandparents during Christmas and New Year's a number of years ago, and all of a sudden, I just got the worst pit in my stomach, something was wrong. And then the phone rang, and it was my dad, and my Granda looked at me with so much hatred. They're very religious, and so they never call anyone particular things but he got the most aggressive I've ever seen him and called me the devil's spawn, brought to this earth to tear the family apart. He hit me. I've never ever forgotten that. And I screamed and begged and pleaded for it to stop and I wanted to die. Even my Nana, who was pissed off at me, thought what he was doing was too much. And eventually, things calmed down but things were never the same. I hated everyone, and I hated my mum for what happened too, because I told her for years that when she does what she does, it destroys my whole life. I hated my dad for being such a pussy and sucking up to his parents relying on them for everything and to tell him he's right even when he's not, because he's the most emotionally stunted person on the face of the earth. And I hated my grandparents for letting everything happen, and always taking my dad's side when things were clearly so fucked up, despite their holy Christian values and attitude. My whole family was and still is living a lie, and I was the only one to date to bring truth to it. And so that was the last straw. And it was after that, that my family went particularly shit, and I've been treated ESPECIALLY differently ever since

Even since she has changed, and I had gotten back in contact with her, and my dad knew, he still had never ever ever ever let go. Even after he split with my sister's mum, he never let everything that happened go either. He thinks every woman on the planet it out to get him, including me. He's the worst grudge holder. And he's also treated me differently because I'm my mum's kid, and openly shit talks her around people. He did it on Christmas, the one that just passed, and I got visibly upset, and my family, my Granda in particular, got extremely pissed off at me and said I was ruining Christmas and that we should just stop everything and be miserable because I'm choosing to be. But my dad has done so much wrong that they are never held accountable for as parents and I resent that. From December until mid February, those were some of the hardest months of my life

The thing that sucks so much, is that years ago we had a really good and special relationship, and I'll never forget those memories, but now he wants nothing to do with me, and thinks I'm toxic, and won't let me see my sister

Even moving out, he kicked me out of the house weeks before, and I had to stay with my boyfriend, and go to the house between very particular hours so I couldn't see my sister. I couldn't look at him in the eyes, but one time I dared to, and said thank you when he opened the door for me. I regret it, because that look basically told me he regretted me even being born

It's just so horrible. He's not fit to look after my sister either. I was his emotional punching bag for years, and I did all the housework, even when I had school. But there was always something wrong and I was always disgusting for some reason. And he always provoked me, just so he could turn around and say I was overreacting. I looked after my sister more than he or her mum ever did - and now that she's a little bit older now, now she finally understands the kind of person my dad is, and is scared of him, and I've seen the way he's started to treat her as he does to me. Not being able to see her or know what is happening is killing me inside. In the very short future, I plan to involve child protection services because it's insane

I'm so grateful that my mum has changed because right now I honestly don't know where I'd be, if I'd even be here, if my entire family was fucked and I had no one

I'm sorry about what happened to you, but I'm happy you managed to cut ties. Sometimes you do everything you can, to make someone maybe get a bit better, maybe see them love you a bit, and it's hard accepting that with some people it can't happen, at least the way things are now, and that you have to let go. Change is hard, but it's for the better, and I'm proud of you for cutting her off. I'm glad you have a wife and kid, a little family of your own. Hold onto that :)"

So while 2-3 years is the goal for kids, just be prepared for that to change if you don't have a stable and decent income.

languagelearning,fl67gbu,t1_fl621fg,1584857027.0,"I learnt kana first thing too a number of years ago when I started learning, and it's certainly the best thing to do. 

1. Learning how to read and write kana, and know the little inconsistencies like small っ or how う extends an ""o"" sound is the first box to tick. 
2. Then you can move onto sentences using basic grammar, and learning the functions of particles
3. And tenses of verbs, nouns, adjectives in polite forms
4. And then the tenses of all of those in their slightly less straightforward plain forms
5. Then learning て form which is a foundation for many grammar points, but by itself means ""and""

Somewhere in there, you could learn some basic conjunctions like ""but"" けど or ""and"" (not the and for listing things と and や - it's actually て form) and ""because"" から and ので

Once all of that is known like the back of your hand, you can speak basic sentences, and you've got a real super solid foundation to learn more complex grammar

All of this is what I did personally, and it's different for everyone, but if you're taking this seriously then I recommend doing something along these lines, but it's totally up to you! :)"
languagelearning,fl65xe4,t3_fmr7t0,1584855517.0,"Like someone else has said, you should probably write the romanisation properly. Japanese unlike English, has very consistent pronunciation as per the letters that represent them. Anything with an ""a"" sound is always ""a"", ""i"" is always ""i"" etc. There's a couple of inconsistencies, like when you learn the usage of the small ""tsu"" っ, or have an う (u) after an ""o"" sound to EXTEND the ""o"" sound. Or when reading katakana words, or like in words like です (desu), ます (masu), the ""u"" part of ""su"" can sort of disappear sometimes, but not always.

To solve the main issue of understanding the sounds you will expect to be hearing in Japanese, you could even listen to someone reading out the Japanese alphabet. Unlike English, there's no super mega funky inconsistencies, so someone even reading out the alphabet rather than individual words is pretty damn reliable

Also keep in mind, that IN CONTEXT, Japanese rarely use pronouns like 彼女 (kanojo)、彼 (kare)、あなた (anata)、or even 私 (watashi). They're usually omitted because in context people know you're you're talking about - and if you must specify, then rather than say a pronoun, people say people's names very frequently.

Like, if YOUR name was すずき (Suzuki) and your friend wanted to tell you, ""your Japanese is so good!!"" While talking to you, they might say, すずきの日本語上手!! (Suzuki no nihongo jouzu!!) And it's very common. 

Also, if you can, try to just ditch romaji altogether, and just read hiragana. You can learn some common kanjis, but you don't need to learn every single one you see for now.

Just something to keep in mind for when you use the language. Good luck!  :)"
LearnJapanese,fl65j6b,t1_fl60mi4,1584855148.0,"You could ask ""why?"" about a whole lot of things from every language, and Japanese people would look at English and think, ""why do they need plurals for everything?"" or, ""why do they use THE, or A AND AN at all? And the fact there's different ones depending on what the next word is? It's so unnecessary"", or ""why do they have to say 'I' and 'you' and other pronouns a million times in the same sentence?"".

Because of how the people who speak it think, it makes sense to them. As a learner, rather than thinking from an English perspective, you have to just start to accept the way things are in the new language to then get into the minds of the people who speak it. Because those concepts don't exist in English.

They use the two different writing systems for different reasons as you saw, but, you asked ""why?"", and fair enough, good question, and I'm curious about things too and love to know why - but there's no point in saying it's unnecessary when it's just the way things are - it's not like you can change it - so ask HOW instead. Out of all the things to ask why about and give up on because it didn't make sense, it was a very simple little obstacle to overcome. As someone else said, it can take as little as a weekend to learn kana. It's up to you what to do, but honestly I'd give it another shot because it's not too big of a hurdle, and even if you decide to give up later, it's nice to know you did in fact sit down and undeniably learned something :)"
LearnJapanese,fl64nro,t3_fmpviw,1584854321.0,"What I did to learn hiragana and katakana, was get my favourite anime opening/endings that I knew really well, and then open up the romaji lyrics and write the entire song in either kana alphabet.

At first it's painful and slow, but if you keep going, and even listen to the song at the same time, you learn the lyrics and you do learn quite quickly. I was 11, and learnt both alphabets in 2 weeks, but to a fairly confident level

I think I still have the little notepads where I wrote the song lyrics somewhere

unpopularopinion,fl63c4w,t1_fl5mank,1584853111.0,"Yeah that was me with my mum, especially during my younger years after my parents divorced. She was going through a lot of shit for many years, but it led to her taking advantage of me and manipulating me, but also leaning on me for emotional support for every problem she had, and she neglected me whenever it suited her. I had moved out of her place and into my dad's, but the problems continued. For that, and mainly for other fucked up reasons too, I cut her out of my life as a teenager, and then missing having a mum (because with my dad things were shit too) after a couple of years, I VERY cautiously spoke with her - and she's done a total 180 - she's got her shit together and keeping healthy, she's with someone who she's married to and actually gives a shit about her and me. 

Only recently I moved out of my dad's place, and went NC with him, and into my mum's place where I'm happy. I have a lot of PTSD from all of what I went through, from both my dad and mum (my dad's a narcissist and since my mum's stuff was less recent, my dad is the main person affecting me atm), and I also have Generalised Anxiety Disorder, depression, as well as one other disorder related to the more anxiety side of things. 

Since becoming an adult and finishing school, starting university, moving out of my dad's place - I feel like I've been doing better than I ever have because I don't have the constant external stressors anymore, but I've really been mourning my childhood because I feel like I didn't get to have one as my parents weren't there to raise me (my mum early on, and dad later on), and I had to practically raise myself. That and, because I grew up differently from everyone else, and I was going through different things, it was always hard to connect with people and just be a damn kid. It's still something I massively struggle with. My dad also had a kid, when I was 10, and when he and my step mum argued which was practically every day, I was always the one looking after my little sister, feeding her, giving her company and making sure she was ok. I've always struggled with feeling alone neglected, out of place, and dealing with fucktons of anxiety (the anxiety largely coming from my dad). 

There are great things I've learned from it, and when it comes to more serious or emotional situations, I tend to have a different perspective from other people, but the challenges in dealing with and managing my own feelings are definitely impacts still felt. At least my mum realises what she did wrong in the past, has sincerely apologised on multiple occasions, and we have a wonderful relationship now. It gives me hope that even the most unlikely of people will change. I hope my dad can do the same and maybe I can make up for lost time with him too, later down the line - and I hope I can see my sister again too!

As much of a dick he may be to you, leaving through an affair with someone else sounds really shitty too.

I feel tempted to ask someone's pronouns because I feel like more of an asshole if I get them wrong by assuming. So rather, people should opt to ask your name and then assume, rather than by appearance. 

That whole community, by denying that a lot of trans people want to pass and go stealth, harm actual trans people and spread the wrong message to the world, not just the trans community. It makes it harder for people like you to live their lives in peace and not have everything revolve around being trans, as everyone wants to make it with trans pride and shit like that. But, from the bunch of cis people wanting to do what they think is right from the messages they've got which is ok, FUCK THE ONES WHO DO IT FOR WOKE REASONS because they're doing it to feel good about themselves, not because they care. 

Anyway, my point is, if you think you've found someone who does the wrong things, but you don't think has intended to, and genuinely thought they were doing the right thing, it doesn't hurt to just educate them a bit, and say that what they did hurt you, but have a bit of understanding towards why they could've happened. People make mistakes and quite a few are totally willing to learn from them when it comes to this stuff. If they're one of the ""woke"" ones though, fuck em - don't even try"
truscum,fl0gdb4,t3_flhw17,1584705500.0,"Rather than asking pronouns, if I were meeting someone for the first time and didn't know their gender, I'd ask their name, and from there I'd follow suit until I'd be corrected. 

I understand where you're coming from, but from a cis perspective I suppose, especially with all the politics nowadays, it feels like you're a horrible person if you don't ask and then get them wrong. I think it's awkward for both sides for different reasons which is why I'd go with doing what I said above - because if I get them wrong after the fact, it feels a bit less awkward and I don't feel as guilty - and it's more understandable why I might've said the wrong pronouns too"
Korean,fl0frgi,t1_fl04tog,1584704905.0,"Every country has its own politics, and people with differing views. English is simply a very very widespread language where people all over the world seem to use it to some degree - unlike a language like Korean which isn't anywhere near as widespread and spoken by a much smaller population. As a result of this, people living in western countries often forget that a lot of other places are fully functioning advanced societies with all sorts of people, politics and ideas. It's quite insulting to those countries"

They're small and cute, and require a bit of attention but not too much, and stay alive for a long time. There are quite a few different types too - some with little flowers on them! You could turn it into a bit of a symbolic thing, where maybe he's the cactus, he's strong and resilient and a survivor, and the little flowers show how he's come to bloom over time in his own way and be comfortable in his skin. Or, maybe the flowers could be a representation of how he helps you grow too :)

Just a little idea"
LearnJapanese,fko5bg7,t1_fkndedv,1584380398.0,"I'm majoring in Japanese at uni and my lecturer is an actual Japanese guy, and he has really terrible handwriting - he admits it himself. As long as people can read it it's fine. Generally, if you write faster and it becomes messy, this is where stroke order becomes important, because a different stroke order changes how the whole thing looks. If you want to write fast that's ok, but just make sure the strokes are correct if you do"
LearnJapanese,fkn2uam,t1_fkn1yc2,1584350905.0,"I know that. It's correct in direct sense, but the meaning is lost through the translation as those words in English wouldn't have the same meaning as Japanese. That's why when translating in general, it should always be translated into normal English, it's common sense. But what I'm saying is that it's sometimes it's important for a beginner _learner_ to learn the direct translations to wrap their head around how the Japanese actually think and perceive things. (It's different for people simply wanting to memorise some phrases to get around in Japan, but if you're doing it seriously, it's important imo)

Through hearing the words or phrases themselves over the time, the meaning and feeling the words are supposed to have would be felt, and through having the knowledge of the literal things, and having experience of feeling those things while actually listening to Japanese without even bothering translating it to normal English I think allows people to get a more thorough understanding of how Japanese as a whole works in the context of Japanese people, rather than English speaking people. When learning new words or phrases from then on, it would be easier because it wouldn't seem as foreign anymore and makes sense in context of the language - and as a result also makes the person better at translating to normal English in such a way that would carry the intended feeling across to English speaker who don't speak Japanese.

Every person that speaks a different language as their first looks at the world through totally different eyes, and to even begin to try and look through them, I think you have to learn the direct translations as well, at least when it is unfamiliar in the beginning. Later on in a learner's journey it isn't anywhere near as important because by that point most people would be able to have that feel of the language and different perception required to grasp the language"

He absolutely hates me now, but I really wish things could become ok enough for me to see him again and have a game or two with him and revisit a time when things weren't as shit. It affected my life for the better because it gave me memories to cherish no matter how bad shit becomes"
LearnJapanese,fkn0t14,t1_fkm76ma,1584348203.0,"Like the other person said, it can be used to quote things. Just remember that particles can have a wide range of uses, they don't necessarily have only one meaning! Some particles have more meaning than others, but just be open to it. 

Also もうし in this case has a long sound - what you wrote, もし, can mean ""if"" or ""perhaps"", but it's often used WITH the actual grammar points that indicate ""if"" in a sentence to emphasise the ""if"" or ""perhaps"" factor :)

いう is the plain form of いいます

もうす is the plain form of もうします (and is basically equivalent to いいます but more polite and humble - it's good for more business-like settings or if you're talking to someone much older)"

languagelearning,fkn08cb,t1_fkmy1ym,1584347450.0,"IPA is just useful depending on the language you're learning and how consistent spelling is to how it's pronounced. I'm not a Spanish learner but it does seem to be fairly consistent within the language and not have a whole insane variety of different sounds. It might be useful for people who have learnt the IPA, or just people unfamiliar with Spanish pronunciation. Rather than consonants, do vowels in Spanish vary a lot from word to word even if the vowel sets are spelled the same? If that is the case, it would be useful then, but again I'm not a Spanish learner lol, I'm a Japanese learner (and IPA is not all that useful for Japanese because it's like the most consistent language ever with spelling and how it corresponds to pronunciation)"
languagelearning,fkmzxr3,t1_fkmiigt,1584347069.0,"Yeah basically every IPA letter has a sound associated with it - and it lists basically every sound every language can make. You don't necessarily need to learn the entire IPA, but maybe find out which IPA are relevant to the languages you're learning. A lot of people don't use IPA to learn languages, and instead just listen to media or people speaking the language, but if you come across a new word that you may not know how to pronounce, if it displays the IPA below it, you can read it and then know how to pronounce the word. It's useful for languages that are more inconsistent with how spelling affects the sounds of words or languages that have loads of sounds, unlike a language like Japanese where it's letters represents sounds in syllables and has consistent pronunciation so it wouldn't be as useful"

AskDocs,fjqy6is,t3_feqotq,1583579237.0,"NAD. I'm exactly the same way and currently have all my plushies sitting in my huge ass bed taking up like half the space. When moving to my mum's place (where I am now) which happened just a few weeks ago, having to pack all of them in a box felt cruel and I got really upset and cried over it so many times. I couldn't see them either for the duration I was where I was because my dad wouldn't let me stay there. Basically, how I chalk it up for me, is that my life has been an absolute mess from when I was 6, all the way till now (19) and despite my constantly changing and unstable environment along with the people and family around me that didn't look after me, something that was always there were my plushies that made me feel safe and protected, and like someone would love me unconditionally no matter what I could have possibly done wrong. As other people have said in their comments, it seems to be a common coping mechanism for people who have gone through some kind of trauma or loss. My mum also suspects I may be on the autism spectrum and it wouldn't surprise me, but I can't self diagnose and will get that figured out. Point is, according to some people here as well, autistic people seem to do this too"
unpopularopinion,fjqtxzo,t1_fjqmsbj,1583577771.0,"Yeah but with Tyrion, it's more what that tells about him as a person - I mean he was renowned for sleeping around, drinking and just being a burden by simply existing to the family in their eyes - but in our eyes we see a different perspective of him being abandoned by his family, and he's probably depressed and doesn't have a purpose or anything to do, and just trying to sort of enjoy the other aspects life has to offer. If those scenes weren't in there I don't think we'd see the true extent of this in a lot of ways - because in some ways what his family says is true but we get to see the motives I suppose. And over time, we start to see less of them as he finds a purpose, so I think those scenes for serve a purpose

Even the scene with Little Finger and the girls, even if I think it dragged on a little, it even shows how he views them, purely as a means to get money and fulfil his own motives - he's manipulative - a very crucial part of his character

I do think there are a bit too many of those scenes, because previous ones would've got the point across, but I don't think they're there for nothing, at least earlier in the series. Towards the end like Arya's scene I dunno man"
