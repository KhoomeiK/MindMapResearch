SuicideWatch,fcpq8x9,t3_eieayu,1577869778.0,Yup. Going into this new year all alone again. Finally pushed my only friend away just before Christmas and have spent both Christmas and new year by myself with no one ever messaging me hoping I have a nice day. All I got was a message from my dad on the 26th reminding me what a disappointment I am and telling me my childhood dog is now blind. Should pretty much just end it now. No ones even around to give a shit anymore lol
MaliciousCompliance,fay3qqd,t1_fauutae,1576394355.0,My Auntie has celiac disease and lives in Switzerland. They never really had the gluten free fad there so it’s very difficult to get a lot of gluten free products. As the rest of the family is from the UK we all bring her over huge gluten free hampers to get here through the next 6 months every birthday and Christmas. So the popularity of it definitely makes life easier and cheaper for people dealing with celiac where it caught on.
aurora,f367wpd,t1_f31ap6m,1570707988.0,Thanks. Turns out it’s two NPRs fighting each other. Really appreciate the help buddy!
aurora,f3108ob,t1_f30w9vu,1570565638.0,Thanks for responding! Yeah. I started with 2 NPRs. Spoilers are Advanced Alien Races?
2meirl4meirl,f1o0vgn,t1_f1n7yro,1569631642.0,Honestly I don’t know. A friend sent it to me and I hadn’t seen it on this sub before and thought it would fit. Sorry
WinStupidPrizes,f1eropx,t3_d92xr4,1569428779.0,"When I was a kid 4 friends and I held a competition to see who could snort a pint of coca-cola quickest. We each put down £20 and winner took it all. I won and it was totally worth. After that we would always say “sniffing coke, you’re doing it wrong” as an inside joke."
maybemaybemaybe,f0rdgnz,t1_f0q41e8,1568880674.0,America didn’t invent the potato chip. The earliest know reference to a potato chip was in 1817 in a cookbook called “The cook’s oracle” by a man called “william kitchiner” in a recipe called “potatoes fried in slices or shavings”. This is a full 36 years before the story of a new york chef trying to appease an unhappy customer who didn’t like his fries. So sorry the potato chip is british.
