-THIS TWEET HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION-

Brad was pointing out the dichotomy between Obama’s implicit trust in expert advisors, and Trump’s willingness to flaunt his ignorance by publicly arguing and disagreeing with experts. He’s saying that, under Obama, the public (at large) didn’t know the name “Fauci”, because his advice and guidance were followed, without public debate, and he never would have been used in a political manner to put a face to any inconveniences the American people might have had to suffer. He (Fauci) never had to defend his knowledge and expertise while an idiot stood behind him, discrediting him with opposing comments, and he never had to make speeches explaining his reasoning or correcting ridiculous and dangerous statements made by the fucking president.   

THE END."

Not only has he fostered a mindset that is selfish AT BEST, but he has actively promoted behaviour that directly opposes what the medical professionals have been suggesting. 
Also, he continues to spout lies and half truths, which only makes matters worse by making people think things aren’t as bad as they actually are, as well as constantly driving home a grossly inaccurate narrative of how America is the best nation in the world, and has been at the forefront of defeating this thing, and blah and blah and on and on - none of which could possibly be further from the truth.   

From disbanding the national pandemic-response team, to saying things like “anyone can get tested” and “very soon, we’re going to come up [with a vaccine]“, to demonstrating a blatant disregard for the safety and well-being of the country by urging states to open sooner than is even remotely safe —the most horrid of which being when he started urging citizens to PROTEST THEIR FUCKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, in an effort to bully them into relaxing the rules— he has been a piece of shit of the highest order, by making every mistake possible along the way, all the while lying to the world and to the entirety of the United States.

thewestwing,fpu19pk,t1_fpsrt1r,1588902523.0,"Well, only because her analogy was seriously flawed, and the interruption itself was in pretty poor taste. However, I tend to agree with her base argument, and I believe any right thinking person (certainly the entirety of the West Wing’s major characters) would/does. The problem is that our dependence on foreign oil, as well as our (oft related) Middle Eastern security interests, force us to do and say things we’d really rather not. Especially when we’ve been a major factor in the region’s instability to begin with.   

The way I see it, CJ is the only major female protagonist we have, among senior staff. Sorkin tended/needed to lean on her pretty hard, when he wanted to make an obvious statement about women, without it looking like blatant pandering. Remember, this was ~20 years ago, and it’s easy to forget that we’ve come a long way. Just imagine her lines being delivered with her passion by Josh or Sam; especially the tearful parts. Certainly, they agree with her sentiments, but it just wouldn’t feel right, coming from either of them.   

That being said, and while I’m definitely Sorkin’s biggest fan, I think “The Women of Qumar” is easily the worst episode of the series; not counting seasons 5-7, or anything with Mandy’s incessant cackling, of course ;)

What in the actual fuck are you talking about, when you say shit like “stay away from zzzquil it has DXM!!!”?   

The active ingredient in ZzzQuil is diphenhydramine HCI, which is...wait for it...Benadryl. The most common pill form of Benadryl(and its generics) contains 25mg of diphenhydramine. A 30ml dose of ZzzQuil has 50mg of diphenhydramine.   

I believe you’re confusing the cough suppressant in NyQuil (and, though a lower amount, DayQuil) - dextromethorphan with diphenhydramine.

The typing thing is definitely a sign, but, assuming your arm and hand are in identical positions for both tasks, I wouldn’t expect to see a dramatic difference in symptom onset. 

Either way, I recommend seeing a thoracic surgeon/specialist. If surgery is required, they’d be the ones doing it anyway. A good thing to do is research doctors in your area that say they work frequently with TOS patients. Also, don’t give up on the neurologist path. A neurologist can help with getting “official” symptoms in your file, as well as advise on next steps. Mine got me down the path for the vascular flavour of TOS, by doing a super simple test where heart rate was measured in my fingers, during different movements and poses (for example: when I raise my right arm anywhere above parallel to the ground, the signal completely flatlines).

Either way, I had no idea about Lowe’s political differences, which, I think, is a testament to his acting skills.

thewestwing,fl89vx7,t1_fl86eve,1584918955.0,"Went back and looked into it again. I was *slightly* off about the original casting decisions: Rob wasn’t happy with the pay offer for the role:   


*SORKIN: I wrote the role of Josh hoping that Brad would play it. But there was a moment when we were having difficulty making a deal with Rob Lowe to play Sam and we were instructed by the network to see more actors for the role. We couldn't find another actor to play Sam and we thought, ""You know who could play Sam? Brad Whitford. Maybe it'll be easier finding an actor to play Josh than an actor to play Sam.""*   


But, he left because he wasn’t happy with the character; partly because he felt he wasn’t getting enough screen time and didn’t feel the character of Sam really mattered anymore, but also because he wanted more money."
thewestwing,fl82tof,t1_fl73kln,1584914716.0,"Probably because Rob thought he was getting the role of Josh, and got all butthurt that Sam’s role wasn’t big enough for him. If I remember correctly, it’s the biggest reason he left the show, only to bomb, spectacularly, with the show he left for.   

Don’t get me wrong, I love Lowe, but his ego got in the way of my beloved West Wing :/"
