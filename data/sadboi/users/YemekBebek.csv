BipolarSOs,ffu4u09,t3_ev56ko,1580234515.0,"Of course it’s possible! I have Bipolar type 1 and OCD, and my partner (3 years) has MDD, GAD and CPTSD. We haven’t been together decades or anything, but our relationship is super solid.

We’ve both had our share of mental health struggles throughout the relationship, because of course life/medication/therapy/insurance isn’t always as simple as we would like. However, I think what makes our relationship so great is that we don’t make each other’s (or our own) struggles about the relationship. Sure, our mental health can’t exist in a vacuum, but there’s so much love, support, and great communication between us that we get through these things and end up with even more appreciation for each other. And even at our worst moments, we are never vindictive, derisive, or seeking to hurt the other.

It’s important to remember that bipolar people are just people. People with different needs, desires, feelings, and impulses. And Bipolar can present in different ways as well. Just because your ex hurt you or acted a certain way when struggling with their illness doesn’t mean your current partner will.

However, do not date this person if you aren’t willing/able to support her in the eventuality that she has an episode or exhibits symptoms of her illness. In a long term relationship, these things are bound to happen, because life happens to bipolar people as much as anyone (just as I’d suggest you not date someone who wouldn’t be supportive of you during a panic attack). If you don’t feel realistically that you can deal with that, I suggest ending things now, rather than during an episode."

Also, have you had the lesions properly swabbed? That’s the best way to diagnose HSV with certainty. It is possible the symptoms you’re experiencing are not actually HSV if you haven’t had it confirmed by a doctor.

Best of luck!"
AskDocs,fbkde3k,t1_fbkcdyu,1576948581.0,"There are other explanations, but I promise you did not contract HSV from a toilet seat. The virus dies very quickly outside of the body. The virus can also lie dormant for years, or remain entirely non-symptomatic.

It is possible you contracted it as a child and have no memory of it. Many people contract oral HSV as babies from their parents or other relatives kissing them on the face.

I don’t want to make any assumptions here because you say you are not sexually active, but if you’ve ever received oral sex, you could have contracted the virus genitally from someone who had oral HSV.

It is more likely to spread from your own oral to genital contact (ie touching the mouth when the virus is active and then touching the genitals), or from benign or sexual contact with an adult in childhood, than to contract the virus from a toilet seat."

bipolar,f9tmdym,t1_f9tlugw,1575631939.0,"To be fair, I’d rather die no matter what, even when baseline, hah.

When I’m manic, I tend to either isolate and go nuts in my apartment, or hang out with strangers I meet on tinder rather than people who know me and would notice something’s off.

Severe depression is unbearable but I don’t have the energy to kill myself, I just make plans and cry about it because I can’t get out of bed, let alone follow through. At least I can sleep for days on end to get out of my head.

Mixed episodes are when I become so frenzied I actually attempt. For me, dysphoric mania is worse than depression or euphoric mania because I’ve got all the hyper-sadness amplified by energy and anxiety and psychosis, and I can’t sleep through any of it."

Although, I’ve honestly done worse when manic than driving into a GameStop lol.

I suppose when I’m manic it can be less apparent to others than when I’m depressed, because it’s more in line with my personality (to a certain point) as I’m a fairly silly and outgoing person generally. But when it gets to the point of having psychosis, it’s pretty apparent that something’s off, and I think most people probably assume I’m on drugs at that point. Which, if I’m manic, is a fair and probably true assumption (historically speaking).

When I’m depressed I will even have cashiers who are total strangers asking me “Hey.. Are you okay?” So I know what you mean. It’s hard to hide it when you’re that depressed, and it shows in your face and your body language. It can be impossible to even get out of bed for days."
bipolar,f9t284z,t1_f9t0j0v,1575606581.0,"In all seriousness, I’m sorry. Depressive episodes are awful. I’m mostly depressed too, but I like to think I’ve gotten a little better at coping with it over the years, and mania never gets easier to cope with.

I’ve literally said the exact opposite of this before (and on this very subreddit, no less) when manic, but: I’ll take being depressed to life-ruining manic episodes and psychosis 😅

I don’t mean that to sound like I’m minimizing depression! I’m actually in a very rare baseline period at the moment and bipolar has a way of creating limited mood perspective—catch up with me when I’m depressed and I’d probably tell me to get fucked lol. Depression is super dangerous too. I hope you’re looking out for yourself!"

Receiving this kind of support and partnership is invaluable, especially when dealing with the mental and bodily hardships that mental illness and pregnancy/childbirth can bring.

I never experienced this kind of support until my current partner, and I can’t even begin to explain how much it means for my life, and how touched I was reading your post. I am sure your wife has undying gratitude for your encouragement, trust, and advocacy, especially now when asserting her agency probably feels impossible for so many reasons. This is the stuff of lasting partnerships.

You could probably rephrase things to placate your family, but honestly I think they should know that you’ve got a zero tolerance policy on unsolicited “advice.” However, stay keen for guidance that’s genuine; as new parents, some of it is bound to be valuable. That said, prepare for 18+ years of thinly-veiled parenting criticisms (especially your wife, people love to shame mothers) and come up with some tools that will help you shut it down quickly and tactfully.

You seem like a great husband and father. And tell your wife that her choice to skip breastfeeding was the right one for her AND the baby—and for her husband, who wants to see her feeling her best! You guys just keep looking out for your team. And congratulations on the new family member :)"

In my experience, stimulants make me feel a bit hypersexual, so I simply crave more taboo things to get off. Honestly, my porn tastes can get pretty weird when I take Vyvanse, but they have otherwise had no effect on my sexuality or sex life—with the exception of increased sex with my partner and picking up edging, both welcome variances!

I would expect that’s all that’s going on with you, as well. Nothing to fret about, in my humble opinion!

And if you’re a little gay, who cares! :) I don’t think that’s likely the case though. I’m not suddenly interested in men because I’ve started watching porn with men in it (gay or straight). It’s always more about the subtext—seeing something that feels taboo, like penises or violence."

As a man, it’s really easy to “just stop engaging” in situations like this because someone else being awful to women (or any other marginalized group, for that matter) can just stop effecting you if you choose not to be around it.

Marginalized people will never have that choice. They don’t have the privilege of being able to speak to oppressive attitudes with the voice and status of someone belonging to a group that is inherently valued. They don’t have opportunities like this to shut these attitudes down. Sometimes they even internalize prejudice toward their own sex or race if it’s all they’ve ever been exposed to.

Sure, this man might not change his ways. But OP speaking up might have been the acknowledgement that man’s wife needed to realize that these behaviors ARE disgusting and harmful, and perhaps she does have a chance to escape them or expose her child to healthier attitudes. Knowing that others support and respect your personhood is powerful and valuable.

If everyone advocated for others the way OP did, perhaps people like this wouldn’t feel so comfortable and entitled to treat people like shit. 

I applaud you, OP! NTA."

AskWomen,f5pjodw,t3_docjhe,1572360993.0,"**TL;DR: My situation began similarly. In my case it ultimately destroyed our friendship. She was (and still is) unhappy in her own life, and unfortunately that seemed to manifest in super transparent pleasure in bringing others down. She lost all her friends. I don’t care in the slightest, and I wish I had cut her out sooner.**

After the last time I ran into her, she told a mutual acquaintance that I looked like shit and my hair was dry. I have Lupus..... 🙄 

I stuck it out for too long (despite the fact that being in her presence made me increasingly tense and negative) because she’s my best friend’s sister. However, I eventually realized it was impacting me to a really unhealthy degree (thinking terribly of myself AND her) and I was like, why the fuck am I doing this to myself?

I’m generally the type to let things roll off my back, and I’ll certainly pardon minor offenses if someone seems to be having a rough week. I’d sooner forget pettiness than make a thing of it, because it just does not interest me in the slightest to have confrontations like that. It’s obnoxious and boring and I’ve no desire to teach another adult how to act or treat others. We all have moments we aren’t proud of now and again, but as I get older I’m finding I really have zero tolerance for tenseness or strife in my relationships to any degree.

I do communicate my feelings now, because that’s another thing I’ve come to value strongly, but I will absolutely not make repeated requests for kindness. I will not hesitate to remove someone from my life if they have no interest in pursuing a supportive and fond relationship. As my friend, I hope you will come to me for love and affirmation when you’re down (or cuddles and silence, thai food, a long walk, etc). Do not come to breed misery in my life.

I look to all of my other friendships—all of the hilarious and supportive women I’m fortunate enough to have in my life who bring my life nothing but love, and laughter, and absolute swelling up with affection... and I don’t want to waste a second on someone who is going to make me feel less than awesome about myself, our relationship, or the time we spend together. And I never want to make people in my life feel that way either.

Let’s say I want to book a ticket now for a trip 3 months out. Right now, RT tickets to Edinburgh from my city (Midwest USA) are ~$800 for October thru early December. Remember, this is the off-season (summers and major holiday travel will always be pricier, and from my city RT Edinburgh flights are typically ~$1k during travel season).

However, I could purchase a RT flight to Dublin for ~$400 during these months, and from there hop on a 1hr flight to Edinburgh for just $32. If I don’t mind spending a little extra time, I could book an even cheaper flight to Dublin from a neighboring city with a larger international airport.

And that’s just the result of a quick google search. Another simple thing you can do is subscribe to flight clubs, which will notify you of inexpensive flights and mistake fares. There are many more creative ways to get your flight prices down with a little bit of research."

I rocked waist-length, unkempt, middle-parted hair for most of my childhood, until I got tired of being called “Slash” and “Samara” (the release of The Ring remake made 2002 a rough year).

I’m more attempting to portray how aggressive my part is. Even pulled and clipped back, you can see in the front how it’s just dying to part. And it runs all the way to the back of my head, rather than end midway as most people’s parts seem to.

There’s even a bit of a cowlick(?) at the front, and my whispies tend to curl rather tightly on my hairline. 

I have a hard time determining my curl pattern,  throughout, as it’s VERY heavy currently as I haven’t gotten it cut in over a year, and probably a bit dry/damaged by hot tools, so it’s not the healthiest.

At the moment, my hair is probably 2a and 2b in most places, and 3b in some spots. It tends toward 2b/3b and some loose spirals when it’s shorter and healthier.

I called off work today because sleep deprivation and stress. Major anxiety at all the final exams and papers I have to write over the next 5 days. 

Meanwhile, my partner is moving in with me on Wednesday and their mom is blowing up the group chat with her own neuroses and insisting on driving to our city FIVE DAYS EARLY to help with the move. Grateful for her help of course, but she’s stressing about what we have and haven’t packed already and I’m like, lady chill! I’ve moved 8 times in the last 9 years I know how to box up a set of dishes!

Also I just found out I have fucking Lupus, I hate both of my jobs and am making myself physically and emotionally ill working 60 hour weeks but between work and school I am quite literally too fucking busy to even sit down and apply for a new job! Also I’m never going to get out of debt and my entire life is one huge bipolar joke!

Also the global climate future is perilous and every minute of every day is interrupted with the miserable reality that is the wealth- and power-consolidating hegemonic evil who are breeding hate and systematically killing the poor and marginalized. The perpetually devolving rhetoric of the US government (among others) is frankly fucking asinine and insulting and the absurdly rich deserve to die. I acknowledge that typing this makes me a fucking idiot and an edgelord but I literally don’t care because I’m living in a constant state of fucking bafflement because the world is literally ENDING and I’m still expected to pay off my fucking credit cards???!

Like people can just SAY they hate women, queers, and POC and that’s just like, an opinion you’re totally allowed to have without anybody batting an eye? Fucking high school incels can just go vote for candidates and legislation which intend to control MY OWN body??? Children are in actual CAGES, and being shot in their schools, and 11 year old girls are being forced by the actual government to give birth to their rapists’ babies but like, we’re all expected to show up daily to work and put in a solid 8+ hours at jobs which are systematically undervaluing our education and/or qualifications, let alone respect the politics of people we interact with throughout the day who are voting for this shit? Like we are somehow fucking chained to the sanctity of “a difference in opinions” even if some opinions are just objectively bad and harmful?

Lol but also literally nothing matters, like absolutely nothing, and that thought makes me feel a little better."
bipolar,euw10e3,t1_euvwt45,1564068245.0,"Definitely not hypo because I mostly just feel like shit and want to die, but very wound up and anxious.

Admittedly, my pdoc did secure me with like 18 months prescription of meds (tripled my “dosage” and wrote me 6 months of prescriptions) which are Topamax and Wellbutrin.

Topamax worked great for awhile until it made me sob uncontrollably 24/7, so I started Wellbutrin which gave me speech production issues (which I don’t feel like have completely gone away), severely activated my OCD, made me feel socially awkward, and also obsessed with stabbing myself lol. Seriously I was buying knives every time I went to Target or the grocer, it was bad.

So my plan with my therapist is to start on just the Topamax again if I start getting manic, but I hesitate to do that now with how self-loathing and anxious I feel, I’m afraid it’d send me over the edge.

I’m trying to reason myself through it and be really cognizant of every thought and feeling and why they’re happening. It works about half the time lol."

I’ve mostly just had some mild depression and no major episodes yet so it’s been okay but I’m pretty medication resistant (yet very sensitive to side effects) so I’m struggling with the idea of going back on. I want to try TMS as it worked really well for my (unipolar) partner but I know it has the potential to induce hypo/mania in bipolar individuals 😬

I’m entering finals week for my summer courses and I stayed up last night working on a research paper.... which turned into watching porn all night and clawing at my sleeping partner in hopes they’d wake up and fuck me. Finally around sunrise they did, and were subsequently late getting out the door (I’m the actual worst).

I didn’t have to be in to work until the afternoon so once my partner left I tried to refocus on my research, but I was so wound up I ended up just masturbating continuously and making myself late for work as well.

Cried on my lunch break about being a fundamentally unlovable, worthless person and concluded I should kill myself. Took a Vyvanse and a Red Bull and put my work face back on, only to spend the next few hours wondering what it would be like to fuck my manager (who is a man.... and I’m a gay woman).

AskWomen,eu97x2i,t3_cf78t9,1563573773.0,"We were together for 3.5 years (living together for 3). It had been rocky for awhile. He had just finished his PhD and landed a fantastic job in another state, I was nearly finished with undergrad. He wanted me to move with him of course, and while I was really happy for him, my gut was really uneasy about moving to an expensive city where I knew nobody and wouldn’t be able to afford an apartment on my own. He was pretty controlling and the prospect of making that move felt like a death sentence, rather than an exciting adventure with my partner. I loved him though. We had shared many travels, had been together since we were both so poor we were eating canned beans for dinner, and had both come so far. Despite his “anger issues” (read: abuse) he always promised to change and I really did want that for us.

My best friend had just moved back to my city and confided in me that she didn’t think I should go with him, but should move in with her, finish school and then consider it. So we agreed I would stay and finish my degree first. He left, I moved in with my best friend, and for the first time in nearly 3 years I felt like I could BREATH. Living with her was the most fun I had ever had, I realized how much I had been walking on eggshells around his temper, and being free from his constant criticism was intoxicating. I didn’t miss him at all.

I planned my first trip up to visit him, and planned to break up with him then. He called me the night before furious and yelling, insisting that I must be cheating because he saw I had friended two guys on Facebook I didn’t have any mutual friends with (our new neighbors). That was the last straw for me. He threatened to break up (his go-to) and this time I said “Let’s do it.”

That breakup was thrilling. It felt like Christmas morning. Suddenly I could see a future for myself. I paid a fee to change my flights and booked a month long overseas backpacking trip for my best friend and I. She saved my life getting me away from that relationship and showing me what it means to share a home with someone you love."

mentalhealth,etee9kl,t3_cb8qr3,1562730181.0,"Funny story: I once called when I was deep in a depressive episode and profoundly suicidal—par for the course, here, presumably.

This dude was so fucking awkward. I’m sure he meant well, and I know I was putting some dark shit on him, but at that point I just needed to feel less alone, to feel heard, and most importantly, I needed the feeling of accountability that telling these thoughts to another person gave me in that moment.

Eventually I became hyper-aware of his awkward and non-responses and began feeling embarrassed at having dumped all my horrible shit on this poor stranger who was clearly not equipped for this conversation, so naturally I reverted to downplaying most of it on a medication issue (partially true) and deflecting with humor so we could wrap things up.

I told him I’d make an appointment with my psychiatrist, etc, and mentioned what was (and still is) the rather funny and bizarre coincidence of finding out months after the fact that my psychiatrist lives in my building, across the hall from me!

He finally spoke with conviction for the first time our entire phone call, no uncomfortable pauses or clumsiness, and said:

AskReddit,esswfze,t3_c8zwj2,1562258724.0,"My childhood best friend and lifelong next door neighbor tried to kill me in a murder/suicide because I left our hometown to go to college.

**TL;DR:** he struggled with substance abuse and undiagnosed mental illness. I was essentially his entire support system and he was extremely possessive of me and became abusive when I left our hometown (I abandoned him). He drove us 100+ mph off a highway exit ramp into oncoming traffic. The car spun out and caused a massive wreck but ultimately we were both relatively unscathed and somehow (thankfully) nobody else was injured. I will forever remember screaming, crying, begging for him to stop and the way he just stared at me so calmly as he increasingly accelerated. It was terrifying.

**Full story:** Seymour was my best friend, I truly considered him a sibling. From age 5 we were inseparable. His parents were totally absent after their nasty divorce (total fucko abusive father who moved down the street after the divorce just to fuck with them, mom was completely consumed by depression) and my home life was also whack, so we spent nearly every waking second together, riding our bikes to stay away from home and getting into stupid kid shenanigans.

He had a lot of disturbing tendencies as a kid (lighting fires, torturing insects and I suspect small animals) and was generally just a really emotional oddball with an unfortunate name, so he was bullied a lot in school. I always stood up for him even if we did have our own spats (we fought like a little married couple) and people always said he had a crush on me, but in middle school he came out as gay. I was struggling with my own sexuality (I’m a woman) so we got through it together. He seemed to grow out of most of the weirder behaviors and find confidence.

He was fucking hilarious. The wittiest person I’ve ever met, he was so quick on his feet in conversation. So smart. Super charismatic and outgoing. Naturally, in middle/high school he was really popular. I wasn’t as much, but I was forever his #1. He had a dark side though. He was pretty clingy at times and jealous if I didn’t spend much time with him or text him back when I was with other friends.

When we were sixteen things took a turn. He started abusing his mom’s prescription medication and drinking heavily. He spiraled quickly. I tried to get him help—his parents were useless, but I eventually got him into rehab with the help of our school guidance counselor (awesome guy). Seymour struggled with sobriety over the next couple years but ultimately just got sneakier about using. He drugged and raped me on more than one occasion. I just wanted to get him help.

I left for university at 18 and he constantly harassed me via constant abusive texts and phone calls. I periodically cut off contact with him, but always called his parents or the police when he would send me pictures of himself with guns threatening suicide.

Finally, one weekend during a period where he seemed to be doing much better, I visited home and went to see him. He was cheerful and wanted to go for a drive a smoke a cigarette like old times. Rather than the typical leisurely cruise around our city, however, he hopped on the highway and quite suddenly began acting more and more unhinged. His demeanor changed entirely, and he started saying some really creepy stuff, much of it very sexual. I tried playing it cool, asked him to take the next exit so we could stop at a gas station for cigarettes. He ignored everything I said and I started to panic, repeatedly asking him to pull over the car so I could get out. He just kept driving faster and faster, until I was screaming and crying for him to slow down, pull over, anything. He just looked at me, completely calm, smiling a little, and slammed his foot on the gas as he swerved onto an exit ramp going over 100mph. I realized we were going through a red light into oncoming traffic of a major road, and I distinctly remember my internal monologue going blank as if it stopped bothering with language and just blipped to this expectant feeling, waiting...

My memory goes fuzzy here. Seymour slammed on the breaks as soon as we broke through the intersection, causing his SUV to spin out in the middle of traffic (it felt like we were spinning forever) until we somehow crashed into the shoulder. I remember hearing a deafening chorus of car horns, metal crunching, tires screeching and skidding as the entire intersection of traffic tried to avoid us. But I don’t remember what any of it looked like, just being completely disoriented and not knowing which way was up.

When it was finally over and I realized we were both somehow alive, he did the most frightening thing ever. I was catatonic with shock, shaking, and he just grabbed my hand and said, in the calmest, most sickeningly sweet voice, chuckling like he was amused and poking fun at me, “YemekBebek, are you scared?? Did I scare you? I didn’t mean to scare you sweetie.”

I don’t have a clear memory of what followed. I know he spent a few days in the hospital psychiatric unit until he dismissed himself. I think he caught some pretty serious charges, but like all of his legal troubles, his parents waved their money and connections at it and he never faced any real consequences.

I cut him off entirely. Blocked his phone number and social media. I moved so he wouldn’t know where I lived. The last time I spoke with him was about a year after that, when he approached me via a new social media account saying he was sober with a massive apology for everything he’d ever done. I responded cordially and left it at that, until a couple days later when he sent me a racist rant insinuating I must be living under Sharia law because I was dating a person from a predominately Muslim country. Blocked.

To this day I still have nightmares about him."

The title and first line immediately turned me off. Always avoid putting your metaphor in the title—let your poem speak for itself. Frankly, I would avoid putting your literal metaphor anywhere, and “storms are people” itself feels very “high school deep.”

The first line also comes off juvenile and cheap. I would advise against using cliches or common phrases in your writing. Give us words that come from you.

Also, perhaps I’m being needlessly pedantic here but lightning and thunder are quite literally not the same thing. This really disrupted my reading of the poem.

I do appreciate that you’re playing with line breaks, and I didn’t think the rest of the poem was all that bad (in fact, I thought the end was nice). I appreciate what you’re going for, but some of the breaks in the middle felt excessive to me and disrupted the flow, although that may just be my particular reading.

I really hope I haven’t discouraged you—it’s a beautiful thing to share yourself in words, so I always want to give honest critiques because that’s the sort of feedback that has helped me improve. Happy writing!"

I have a ton of vintage pieces that are 1000x more interesting than any retail piece I ever overpaid for.

It’s so funny, because while I’ve received compliments on my sense of style in the past, I’m being approached a lot more now to ask where I got something! Goodwill!

It’s so much more fun to tell someone “I paid $3 for it!” or “The Goodwill on Way St. has a ton of shorts like this!” instead of watching their face fall when you explain it’s from an expensive brand.

BipolarReddit,eqsngmr,t1_eqs9xoa,1560288999.0,"With my previous (high deductible) insurance plan, it cost $1800 for a 30 day supply before meeting the deductible (after that it would be $60/month). The company offered me a “high deductible savings card” in the meantime that would save me UP TO $400/month. Obviously that sort of price tag wasn’t an option. 

My current insurance through Ambetter is fantastic for meds ($0 generics, $25 name brand, $0 deductible) but the trade off is an abysmal mental healthcare provider network. So, I’m paying out of pocket for appointments with my pdoc ($240/appt) and therapist ($20/appointment with sliding scale accommodations).

Ambetter did try to convince me to try other medications before covering my Vyvanse, so I can only assume they’d do the same with an expensive medication like Latuda. My pharmacist saw the steam coming out of my ears and fixed it with a phone call.

Point being, insurance plans can vary widely and even the “good” plans will probably avoid paying out if they can manage it."
