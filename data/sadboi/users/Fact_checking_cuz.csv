hsp,foiw6ym,t1_foeqbdd,1587799076.0,"Is it that it does not appeal to you to actually do the domination type stuff with a real person? I’m not sure if I understand how all this works for myself. But I’m 25 now and have had such low confidence in my sexuality since I was with my first gf at 18 because she wanted me to dirty talk her and be aggressive and dominate her, and it just wasn’t me. And then my next gf wanted to be dominated too, not as extreme, but still in a way that wasn’t something I actually wanted or would’ve enjoyed. Even though I do watch domination porn too. 

Anyway, this weighed on me for years and I avoided sexuality altogether because I felt so inadequate. I’ve learned more about sexuality and now know that there’s an incredible variety in what people want and what turns different people on. I just hope that you don’t have to feel bad thinking it’s a flaw or a sexual weakness on your part. There’s a lot of weirdness around male sexuality in our culture, and fear of being inadequate. We all end up bullying each other about it without realizing it. I’ve found that there’s a very major difference between peoples porn tastes and real life tastes. I don’t know why that is."

And it gives me some hope that Even if I have to stay for a while longer, there’s still good people to find. And you are right, the winters are so gloomy here!! I enjoy it for the first couple months but i think it’s right around this time of year that it gets to be too much. Everyone around me seems to be in a worse mood right now. 

Do you know which part of New England you would be in?"
hsp,fi2dqn4,t3_f5yorh,1582077391.0,"I had a feeling as I was reading the first paragraph that you were gonna say you lived in the PNW. I live in Portland and this has been my experience as well. At first I blamed myself and thought somehow I was putting out a negative energy (I was very depressed for my first few months here, and so probably I actually was putting out some negative energy). But after traveling around a bit and coming back, I’ve concluded it’s the culture here. 

In Portland at least, it seems to me like a lot of people are somewhat angry and unhappy but they don’t feel they are able to express themselves freely and so it creates this tension everywhere. I loved living in New England because even though people were neurotic and not necessarily the happiest, everything was out in the open, and everyone spoke their minds. I remember going on walks and someone would strike up a conversation with me and we’d end up having an intense connection talking about our lives. It happened a handful of times in 5 years in New England, but that has not happened to me once in the PNW. I find it very difficult to connect with people here, I think many people tend to be closed off. 

I’ve felt the same as you, that when I’m out and about I have a cold shell around me. I generally feel suspicious of other people now and assume if anyone interacts with me it’ll be negative somehow. And any time I’ve spent some time in other places (California and Texas mostly), that feeling has gone away after a couple weeks. I don’t want to stay here, I can tell some people find this culture to be a good fit for them somehow, maybe they are not as sensitive or maybe it’s something else, but for me it just doesn’t work. 

Hope this helps give you some clarity."
hsp,ffsbij6,t3_euw29d,1580177778.0,"I went through a very long period like this that I’m coming out of now. I think of it as a time of depression now. I felt hopeless and mostly felt either anxiety or frustration all the time. But being alone was ok. The main thing that was tough was how hard it was to talk to people. I felt like I went months without ever getting into the flow of a conversation, and every time I spoke it was a huge conscious effort. I couldn’t remember if it had always been that way but I didn’t think so, and I was scared I was degenerating somehow. It was bizarre, and I think it would have helped me at the time to understand that it was not normal to feel that way, I was right to believe I had not always felt that way, and I would come out of it eventually. 

The thing about this time was I held a deep seated belief that I was inferior to other people, and that I did not have much to hope for in the future. I didn’t realize how thoroughly I believed these things at the time because it came on slowly, and so I couldn’t understand what was wrong. But these things were why I could never connect with other people, and that’s why every sentence felt like awkwardly forcing words together. Those were just symptoms. The depression was something that needed to happen for me to learn to accept uncertainty about the future. 

Anyway, I hope this in some way relates to your situation. This is all to say that this is probably anxiety and depression, and it’s okay, you will come out of it. The social symptoms make everything worse but there’s no need to worry too much about them in particular. And it may take a while to understand what it is you’re going through, what the real cause is. Trauma happens to everyone, and in all kinds of forms that are not talked about (graduating from college, for instance). Any time you lose an identity you thought you had, that can be a trauma. And they take a long time to heal, sometimes a couple years. So just be patient with yourself if you can"

RationalPsychonaut,fccu2s2,t3_egv9mw,1577602643.0,"This reminds me of a friend of mine who had his first manic episode earlier this year, it was very serious. He started to seem progressively less in touch with reality and having delusions about his place in history as a bringer of social change, like Gandhi or Nelson Mandela. By the end of it he wasn’t sleeping more than an hour or two a night. He ended up damaging some of his relationships and even destroying some by treating people disrespectfully and acting aggressive, and we worked with the family and in the end had to take him into a psych hospital against his will. That was almost a year ago. He started to be himself again after a couple months on mood stabilizers. He’s doing ok now, but that was no joke and it was nothing like any kind of psychedelic-induced enlightenment. It was more like the brain going haywire as a response to stress from big life changes."

hsp,f9lft8b,t3_e5grvg,1575422044.0,"Just wanted to let you know that you’ve put so much of what I’ve felt in the past couple years into words (I’m 25 now). Especially feeling invisible and that I’m the one overlooked if I’m with others. Feeling creatively blocked. That I’m never good enough. And that I’m pitied, and so can’t really connect with anyone. 

I’m just trying to let go of the question of whether I’m good enough, or whether I have the life I want to have, and instead do what’s in front of me that I can do that I know is making things better. If you hate the job you just started, maybe that could mean leaving it. It’s strong to try something new and it’s strong to listen to how you feel about it. 

Also therapy and medication have helped a lot for me too. I’ve been seeing more and more lately that I’m not alone in all these feelings of inadequacy I’ve been having. It’s hard in our 20s maybe. All of the expectations on us have changed from what they were our whole lives. And it’s especially hard because we are so sensitive."

INTP,f89kkav,t1_f88s6dh,1574374697.0,"Glad I could help, it was a big disappointment to me to find that college was not really different or less of a game than high school. I felt like I’d been lied to by the older generation. I think it really was different for them though. 

I had a chance to take a semester off but pushed through, although I’m not sure if that was the right choice in hindsight. I graduated with mediocre grades thinking I’m done with school forever and bitter about the whole thing, but after being in the job world I see what I could get out of school and I’m actually thinking of going back with clearer purpose. Maybe time off before would’ve helped get things straight sooner. 

It’s too bad though, cause undergrad was really good for meeting people and growing socially. It’s been harder to do that afterwards as an introvert. Fresh out of high school was the perfect time for that part of college."
INTP,f8793vk,t3_dze8d3,1574321242.0,"I hated school for the same reasons. The only solution I could think of is to be absolutely clear on what I want to get out of school (ie CS to work in software development, or psychology to become a therapist). It’s a nice idea that school is a place of learning and exploration, but it just wasn’t that. So it’s gotta be a means to an end where you keep the end in mind the whole way to keep you going."

That people with enough have no idea what it's like to feel shut out and invisible, and at least by voting for someone who everyone knows is a joke they can be heard.

It seems to me that theres a strong divide here between people in tech and people not, and those not tend to feel lost and struggle to make enough, while those in tech seem to be pretty happy. San Francisco is great (that’s where I’m from) but very career oriented. Pacific Northwest (where I live now) is dark and dreary two thirds of the year, so if that affects you not a great option, and the people are a bit closed off and tense. But then again, the people I meet are not in tech. New York seems awesome just from hearing others talk about it. The Bulgarian friend I mentioned lives in queens and likes it. Massachusetts (Worcester and west of Worcester) is the only other that I have first hand experience with and it’s my absolute favorite because of the prickly but kind and open people. The weather is super rough though, and the tech I think is only in Boston, which I can’t speak to.

Edit: also I’ve never been, but people seem to be crazy about Austin Texas! I think there’s a solid tech industry there

I should also add that western mass is hard to make a living in moving there without a job. I lived in Worcester and couldn’t even get a job bagging groceries"

You gotta just push through, cause you gotta build a relationship with your voice, and learn what kind of melodies your voice/personality is suited for. One big one for me was realizing I’m not someone who sings fast melodies spitting out a ton of words, like someone like Elliott Smith is. I am naturally better at slower melodies with sustained notes. Just as an example of the kind of barrier I didn’t know was there until I just chipped away at the singing problem for months. Also just imitate singers you like. Also you gotta build a relationship between your instrumentation and your voice, so you know how to use them together. That’s the most important part for writing songs as a vocalist. That alone can make bad singing not matter. You might even be farther along than you think in terms of technical singing ability. Take someone like Kurt Vile, for instance. His melodies aren’t crazy hard to pull off or anything, and his voice is so raspy, but it feels right cause it’s his very own, and he figured out how to have his conversational mumbling float over geometric guitar parts in a way that you can tell feels totally comfortable to him. Developing a style like that takes longer than it would seem like it should, so don’t be discouraged and don’t assume you should naturally have that!"

Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to have the life you want in your new place too quickly, just do what you can and don’t forget if you feel bad that it is, in fact, difficult to be in a new place without friends or family (I’m assuming that’s the case), and it won’t always be."
socialanxiety,f1nbgkc,t3_d9zacc,1569613368.0,"Oh god. At my worst, it wasn’t even until it had become a committed relationship that I realized it was a pseudo-crush. It was a horrible thing, I’m ashamed to have done that to someone. Not sure what I can advise other than being aware that we have this potential in us, and to watch for it when the time comes."

hsp,f05sdmn,t3_d3s2db,1568418281.0,"I didn’t like Paris much, I felt it was a very cold and uninviting place. I think depending on your personality it would be a better place to live than to visit. And that is so counter to its reputation. That plus traveling, it sounds like you have an intense schedule, moving around after only a couple days. No wonder you are overwhelmed! I like to stay closer to a week in each place or else that happens. Don’t be so hard on yourself! I’m sure you will enjoy later parts of the trip, the countryside sounds lovely <3

Edit: could you set aside some down time maybe? To just sit in a cafe for a while and read or something?"

infp,f03g8qx,t1_f028d10,1568354747.0,Haha yeah I really have no idea either. I suppose the INTJs in my life are also very private with their true feelings.
infp,f03g3gn,t1_f026pxf,1568354646.0,"Hmm it’s so hard to say, I’ve met every type of INxx’s who have all of those traits. I’m not even sure valuing logic over feeling is the thing that distinguishes thinkers from feelers. I’m an INTP who values feelings very highly but am most comfortable with thoughts. As for the bluntness, that does sound INTJ at first glance."
quarterlifecrisis,f026989,t1_f01egsn,1568324109.0,"You are right, it was definitely not a waste of time. It was a lesson that had to be learned, for one thing, and I met amazing friends in college, one of whom is my roommate now. I think it would be an amazing experience to go to college with a real sense of purpose though! There is so much opportunity to succeed. Best of luck to you as well!"
infp,f025xiu,t1_f01ys69,1568323920.0,Based off your first comment I’d guess INTJ but really hard to know. You definitely could be INFP but I think it’s probably more common for thinkers to mistype as feelers than the other way around.

I have taken it on and off as needed and it usually helps me at first and then the effects kind of wear off after a while. It’s definitely possible to be depressed while on it."

depressionregimens,eyjqouy,t3_cx4s2i,1567125678.0,"I think you’re being very hard on yourself, it might be true that it had some effects on your brain development, but so many things do (loneliness, for example, can make your brain atrophy). There are too many to control. If you turn the spotlight on the effects of long term weed, you can make them seem bigger than they are. I think that when your needs are being met, a lot of the things you feel about it won’t seem so significant. I say all this as a 25 year old who smoked most of the last 7 years and am struggling with some of the same regret. But this is what I’ve come to."
Anxiety,ex3ok5j,t3_cr4cyt,1565988791.0,"I like mine a lot! I agree with others on here that it can be too much to use every night all night as your main blanket, but it’s nice at times when you need it. Like taking a long warm bath at the end of the week. They’re great if you are a cuddly person. 

Mine was given to me as a gift, which is extra nice cause it feels like a hug from that person :)

It’s hard for me to imagine it being calming during a panic attack though. I don’t have panic attacks often, though, so I’m not so familiar with what kinds of things help. I also have evening rather than morning anxiety, so I can’t speak to that, but I do wake up very refreshed when I use the weighted blanket."
hsp,ewu744b,t3_cq52qc,1565767358.0,"One thing that comes to mind for me is I’ve always noticed that (as an adult, at least) I sleep better when I’m not in my own bed. Maybe not better quality overall, but it’s easier to get to sleep and stay asleep. That’s because being away from my routine gets me out of my head. I’m also a 4 (didn’t know we were so common here!) but I think of that as a 4 thing, being prone to being caught in your head."
socialanxiety,ewl7lt6,t1_ewl1p70,1565509745.0,"Maybe he was insulted if you weren’t being as interactive with him as he wanted. But mostly what I meant is, who attacks someone like that out of nowhere if they are feeling fine about themselves. In any case, the barista was a jerk. I was just trying to say I hope you don’t take it too personally. I know I would’ve hurried out of there feeling humiliated and then ruminated about it"

lonely,eqbqnlp,t3_bxtx0n,1559953886.0,I’ve heard people who’ve had cancer say that sometimes even their close friends disappear when they get diagnosed. You learn all about how different people deal with illness this way. This guy must be absolutely terrified.
quarterlifecrisis,eqbpxcb,t3_bxwzp0,1559953238.0,"Idk what’s with the other commenter, but it sounds to me like you’ve taken a very honest look at what’s happened and will learn from it. Both about the place relationships will have in your life and about finding some sense of inner purpose. 

No one I know at my age (24) has their shit together at all, but we’ve all made some progress since we graduated from college. Through having jobs go well or not, and having relationships go well or not. Not one of us is in our dream job right now, of the people I know."
Mindfulness,epvqffw,t1_epvpu01,1559545147.0,"Oh yeah I wasn’t even talking about OCD specifically, just about having trouble meditating cause you’re worried whether you’re doing it right. I’ve had OCD flare ups at times and I’m not sure that meditation helped with those. I think I’ve had OCD when there’s something I’m having a hard time accepting within myself, maybe meditation helped with that in the long term, but I’m assuming that’s just one of many causes of OCD"
Mindfulness,epv67wh,t1_eptgiyu,1559525197.0,"I’d agree with the commenter who said not to worry about getting it right and that that’s the wrong advice for you. I had the same problem as you do and the thing that worked for me eventually was just doing so much meditation that I didn’t worry about any one session. Which allowed each session to be a time where things fell into place in their own way without me trying to control and direct them. 

It reminds me of the headspace pack on self esteem and also on anxiety. Those might be very helpful to you. Especially the anxiety one. He talks about this fear and how to deal with it."
