Anxiety,ex3xuw3,t3_cr9490,1565993995.0,"Yep. Similarly, I have a boss who will drop a 15 minute meeting in my diary later in the day, no subjects or agenda - it's been positive feedback, company updates, updates needed from me about work flow and sometimes negative feedback. He springs it on me and gives me no time to prepare and get my thoughts in order, I dwell on it all day until the meeting wondering what it will be about. Thankfully I was able to train him out of it - I just started declining the calendar invite, and told him I'll always decline if the calendar invite has no specific subject or agenda. It annoys him, but he now respects that boundary - anxiety or no anxiety, it's just bad people management!"

I also learnt that living in Australia doesn't mean I'm safe as bats can carry Australian bat lyssavirus, similar to rabies - you won't catch it from other animals apparently, but don't mess with the bats :S"
