Sometimes when all that shit that’s inside starts to burst, she tends to snap at you. I could be wrong though. Maybe you aren’t right for eachother and arguing all the time is a sign you should break up. Either way you need to sit down and talk, no matter how hard the subject is to talk about.

relationship_advice,fiow94o,t3_f91n1f,1582592471.0,"Okay, it’s understandable that you want to be fair and engage in your SO’s fantasy. But you need to put your comfort and emotional needs before sexual desires. Don’t do things that you think you’ll regret or be uncomfortable with. If he isn’t okay with that then he isn’t a good guy. At the beginning of my relationship the idea of a threesome came up from my boyfriend, I told him no, it makes me uncomfortable and  in my opinion a relationship and sex is between the people in the relationship Nobody outside. He was kinda disappointed at first, but as our relationship grew more serious we both only need eachother and he doesn’t want to have that intimacy with any other girl. So maybe that would work in your case too, but please don’t do something you’re not comfortable with for a mans pleasure."

relationships,fhi7xew,t3_f3e19s,1581619445.0,"You are not a jerk at all. You have important plans like your fathers birthday. His mother never relayed any Information to you and it’s her own fault. She seems clingy and too attached to her son and seems to like to control his schedule to make sure he always has time for her and doesn’t really care for you. I can relate to this, maybe not the time you’ve been together. But I am very independent from my family now as you are and my dad is divorced and alone most the time too. My boyfriends mother seems to like to keep control and always ask him for favors and do things for her and takes trips. It gets tiring when we are trying to start our life together and have our own plans and it gets overwhelming sometimes. 

I think the best option is to make sure your voice gets heard, who cares if they see you as a jerk. You and your husband agree that his mom made a mistake and you shouldn’t feel obligated to go just because she bought the tickets. She didn’t even tell you for gods sake. You and your husband need to make a decision together and tell her your decision. Don’t let her put her input on it anymore. You make up your mind and stick to it. If she wants you to pay for your ticket, that’s up to you but I wouldn’t."

To me it feels like her control is to stress him out with all the tasks he has to do and how she is keeping track of them. But he doesn’t feed into it he just gets fed up stressed out for a minute and then gets over it.

It’s just when the ranting and texts become so much that it becomes tiring and just wants it to be over ya know. But in my mind it’s like you have to keep arguing and fighting or ignoring her until it stops. Because that how it was with my mom who was also very controlling and knew how to weave what she wants into your mind ya know. I had to keep fighting with her and then I just stopped replying to messages that I didn’t care to argue about because I know what I want and it’s final.

That hurts worse than the world. I have bad anxiety, especially about time, I always feel like I’m late no matter how early I get ready or when I arrive. And I could see how people think that’s ridiculous, but it hurts when you’re told how ridiculous you are for feeling a way that you can’t control. Because you really cannot control it.

unpopularopinion,f90oep2,t1_f90l7l6,1574975091.0,"They’re the older rules. When D&D first came out and became popular lots of different rules from other dungeon games and magazines formed and one of the first rule books was the white box rules. I played a lot of the first edition D&D and my dad played as a kid when it first came out. So I learned every which way to play. There really isn’t one set guided way that each dm HAS to DM. You choose how you want your game to go. A lot of rules if I need help I pull from the DMX handbook. It takes back to the basics and origin of D&D and helps you figure out how you want to run your campaign and what rules you want to have. I think 5E hold your hand too much, especially rule wise and spell wise. 
    Spells are magic and magic is chaotic it isn’t gonna preform the same way every time it isn’t like a sword so it has its own ups and downs. 

Definitely check out the DMX 

It helps DMs expand by opening up to different rules and lets the DM have more freedom and the players definitely have more chaos but more fun with it"
unpopularopinion,f906xsp,t1_f8zkyq9,1574968802.0,"Like I’ve said it all depends on how your DM runs the game. Not everyone plays the same. For me I do spells differently. If your casting a spell your going to always roll to hit/affect then you’ll roll a damage die to see how well the spell works. I don’t like that when you cast a spell depending on what spell it is whether it’s a save dc or an attack it will do the description. I use DMX rules for spells. So in this case you as a caster cast charm roll to see if it will affect the goblin, if it does you roll to see how well it works. Now this is happening at the same time it attacks so depending on how well it works it may cancel his attack and he will “miss” his attack. The reason it’s faster is because you aren’t going to each person turn by turn. Everyone gets 2 minutes to plan and then everyone makes their move. It flows better for my campaigns and is more immersive rather than static. 

I play every week as a player for another campaign and while I enjoy it. 5e or the way he DMs isn’t as immersive there a lot of rules and mechanics I don’t enjoy. I enjoy as a dm letting players guide the campaign while I stay in control of the outcomes of their decisions"
unpopularopinion,f8z3kn6,t1_f8z2dtd,1574956445.0,"Yes, originally in the origins of dnd it was everyone who plays the game plays it differently because there were no rules yet. Now in 5th edition, many different rule books have been created and new dms/players play by those rules making games sometimes feel static or boring. Which is why I play by creation and pulling different rules from different games or creating my own to make my game feel immersive how I want it to."

I got a job and start Friday. I am so proud I was able to accomplish something. My mom said she’d buy me a car. But this week we aren’t even looking at one and I’m so worried now that I won’t get one and I won’t be able to get to work and I’ll lose the job. 

I’m heart broken 

My dog was put down last Wednesday, he was the only saving grace of being at my moms and he’s not here anymore. 

My dad won’t help me because he claims he doesn’t have the money but really he does he just spends it on himself. He tells me to just pay my mom the 100 a month and see how it goes. But then I’d be stuck in her debt again. 

I’m so broken right now. I feel horrible about myself. 

My mom sat me down and told me I won’t be able to do the job because of anxiety and that I’m not growing I’m hiding from life. Even though I’m in clubs and go out and live life more than before. I have goals now. She tells me I’m depressed and need to take pills. But pills never helped me.... and when I would bring up being depressed before when I was little she’d deny it....

There is no need to be rude. The cards are meant to look like oil paintings, and that leads to having layers of paint. Especially having to make it so the text and background aren’t visible takes layers of paint. I like the idea of oil painting so that they look older and I can layer. As for color matching no it won’t be perfect digital color and paint color is very difficult to match, and the paint is pearl which gives it a gloss and sparkle so it shines different color in different light.

I these are my own and part of my collection, I like the way it pops off the card it’s my style, I know how to paint my own cards, thanks for the opinion though"
Anxiety,eqle3of,t3_byqwce,1560142661.0,"I get the same feeling. Same situation to.. You just have to breathe and remember that you can trust him and how much he loves you. Communicate even if you need time to think about what you're going to say it's always better to say how you feel sometime rather than no time. Maybe he will get annoyed or upset over things he doesn't understand but he loves you and is willing to listen. You have to remember it's okay to cry very it out. It's okay to share feelings and look for the positives in your relationship. My positives are knowing he is grateful when I make dinner or when I clean, making him smile, being sunny and full of love when he comes home from work. And knowing each day is spent being with my best friend."
Anxiety,eqlcplv,t3_bym87e,1560141848.0,I flunked out of college for that reason... but after going through that I have seen a counselor and learned ways to help control my anxiety. Just breathe and distract yourself. Find something positive in your life and focus on that
pokemon,eq6l5qh,t1_eq4ybri,1559831098.0,"1- routes are basically meaningless. 2- safari zones don’t matter anymore because just like in let’s go eevee and pikachu you basically in one most of the game. There is no supervise to what you’ll find in the tall grass. 3- you must be blind, there are raid battles...that basically have to participate in if you want to complete the game. 4- the art style is nothing like Pokémon, they’re trying to be like anime children’s art styles now instead of their own. It makes Pokémon look childish and boring. 4- they abandoned the idea of mega evolutions and z- crystals, two good ideas just to make a new “mini game” almost feature dynamax (also from Pokémon go, raid battles the Pokémon are larger and more powerful) that makes your Pokémon huge for no reason, if your opponent does the same thing it cancels your power out and your just battle Pokémon like normal it is the most retarded thing. They should’ve done more with mega evolutions and focused on the story instead of stealing ideas from Pokémon go and making it feel like a mini game instead of a core game. The feeling of adventure is gone to me. There is literally one Pokémon I like which was the Knight bird and that’s because it has a complex design and is overall similar to other gens. The legendary basically have the same color scheme as greninja instead of a cooler metallic color scheme to go with the fact that they are basically knights. If you can’t see this then hop off my post"
pokemon,eq4xojd,t3_bwy7ul,1559788443.0,At least I can still play the old games. Does story not matter to you anymore? Because all you seem to focus on is shitty childlike new Pokémon designs that don’t even fit Pokémon’s art style. You do this because you want to look like a more popular anime instead of bettering your own show and games. Secondly all your doing in new games is push them to be more like Pokémon go which is a totally different platform and doesn’t need to be in core games because it has no place. Get your shit together and make a good game
