neuro,fqu5u6n,t3_gknert,1589652603.0,"Remember that empathy is something missing from both sociopaths and psychopaths and for others it’s a second nature response there fore it must be,when these people are detained ( serial killer) the law will not always come from a victim state instead use flattery to get to their offenders (praises their methods). These people have no remorse for what they do,the brain has to be alter in a way because the rest of the population has remorse when there actions are up front.If you look at personality disorders they have been mental changed and in some cases they can not experience anything normal ( not empathy,remorse or compassion) I have oftentimes considered a connection between the two people"

BPD,fqnpy71,t3_gjfzwi,1589499263.0,Thank you for this post as I’ve always believed some what of the condition is created by being trapped in ones own headspace and getting help from the wrong people ( trusting that the system created by others are the only solutions)

mentalillness,fpcjl80,t3_gcjq98,1588502965.0,I relate as I thought I didn’t have a problem with depression because I wasn’t Suicidal most of the time but as my life progressed and prolonged untreated depression lead to substance abuse issues that become a larger part of living with depression.
bipolar2,fp99dsa,t3_gbtwp5,1588419268.0,"I don’t think this would be fair comparison given I’m also on the ASD spectrum but my one major issue is that I don’t have any clue why’d flip at times over minor shit,good example being I was fully manic and panic set in when I was making thanksgiving dinner because I didn’t have enough ingredients for my stuffing and I remember a couple days of my family walking on egg shells with me 💩😳"

depressed,fomkusj,t1_folmk7l,1587893830.0,I’m not sure what your not understanding? I’m in a small rural town not  a larger city of average of about 10 doctors offices and I’m on medication called Act-Venlafaxine XR 75 MG because I was experiencing regular panic attacks and I’ve had depression for years and now I’m experiencing worse depression being on my medication 🧐
depressed,follg5y,t1_fokvteh,1587864796.0,"My doctors office is closed and the pharmacy is only faxed prescription from doctors . Side effects are weight gain and further depression,I was put on the medication because of panic attacks this honestly is the second antidepressants that’s not worked out for the same reasons! I’m going to have to be a downer here for what it’s worth COVID-19 is putting the risks of those who have mental illness at risk. I’m in a rural small town and I’m not the only person who’s struggling with mental health during these times because of doctors offices closed down!"
asd,foitlp0,t3_fp17fv,1587796593.0,How would you get a diagnosis as an adult? I’m 21 and wasn’t diagnosed in my childhood and I’ve educated myself and I have and always had a lot of the symptoms of ASD. I’ve had anxiety issues for years and now I’m on medication for panic attacks.As a teenager I developed depression and still struggle with depression.For me it’s a roller coaster ride at times but I’m honestly a very independent person.

BPD,fo55yug,t3_g5ow8f,1587518234.0,"I have to disagree with the empathy part of BPD as I’ve seen the total flip side of that from sufferers over my life time.ASD effects brain function of the suffer as well as it refers to a neurological condition and I do hope more people not on the spectrum would understand that like your illness we’re not to blame, it can be frustrated with society because it’s rushed we need to have an explanation to understand a lot of things but we feel all or more compassion Empathy and love  for the people in our life’s and the world.For example I try to understand more about BPD as I imagine any mental health illness can be difficult and I have suffers in my life and I’ve been though dark days with my own depression there fore I know how it can be dealing with the thoughts of one’s own mind"
BPD,fo53u68,t3_g5ow8f,1587516917.0,"Getting help never hurts,asking for help never hurts. Myself I’ve been thought traumatic events in my youth that I know has shaped me and I got professional to help me though so I didn’t take it out on those around me.Yes I’ve been told that trauma is the core reason why BPD forms but I never understood why some people chose not to let the past effect them and others suffer from mental illness because of it.I’ve been told because of my depression I shouldn’t be negative or moody and down as well btw"
BPD,fo50tty,t1_fo509zc,1587515096.0,"Dude I have ASD,depression and anxiety.Ive been told to snap outa depression to just calm down when having anxiety and ASD ( Autism spectrum disorder) is a condition most typical people ( those not on the ASD spectrum) have difficulty understanding and yes I can relate to being misunderstood and not having my spytoms taken seriously. I’m sorry you feel as though your being attacked because I’m actually trying to help as I know that when I got my mental health under control I was a lot better and so were those around me. I’m no longer suffering in my own mind because I take medication and therapy and it took years for me to realize how bad my depression was but it’s the best gift I’ve gave myself getting help!"
BPD,fo4ziyt,t3_g5ow8f,1587514329.0,"If someone is trying to give positive feedback to help ease your suffering why be angry at them,if there genuinely trying to improve your mental health or point you in the right direction accepting help is the best gift anyone suffering from a mental health illness can give themselves and those people that care the most about their health"
BPD,fnv15un,t3_dn4gm6,1587276908.0,"Lack of empathy and compassion. From a dry drunk family member with BPD was the verbal abuse I never needed. I’m mentally unstable according to someone who is suicidal and has been in and out of rehab,I’m a complete failure according to someone who has only 3 years clean time in 15 years plus ( I’m sober today without 12 step working programs or rehab) 

Manipulation! I’m going to kill myself if you leave me and yes I’ve been in a situation I stayed longer then I should have because of this lie only to discover that it’s a fear of BPD to be abandoned in any case treating to kill you self for personal gain isn’t right 

Selfish people who don’t have empathy or compassion for others is the BPD I’ve seen in my life time"
