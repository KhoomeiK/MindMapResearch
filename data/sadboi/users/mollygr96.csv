AskAnAmerican,fr09zze,t1_fqzcf8t,1589788417.0,"There are a lot of things!

People in America are generally more relaxed and non-judgmental than Europeans when it comes to a way of life. Even in the Deep South where I’m from, the general attitude is “I don’t give a fuck what you do, it’s a free country,” (at least when it comes to your clothes, your political beliefs, etc. America still has a long way to go with racism and homophobia; the lack of judgement I received there is a direct result of my privilege as a heterosexual white woman). Here, I feel like there’s a certain way you should be and if you aren’t that way, people just don’t like you that much. In America, I always felt a little different. I always felt like I didn’t exactly “fit in,” but I never personally felt like people thought there was something wrong with me — they just thought I was different from them (obviously this feeling is post high school because teenagers are assholes). 

On a similar note, in America I moved around a lot. I had many different home towns, I was welcome with open arms and made to feel like I belonged there. Here, I’m looked at as an outsider — someone who needs to prove they belong. Part of this is due to a language barrier, my Spanish isn’t that good and hasn’t improved rapidly enough to really bring myself into the culture. It’s difficult to motivate yourself to improve your language skills when it feels like no one wants to talk to you anyway.

Don’t take this to mean Spanish people are rude, they’re not. I just honestly think that, generally, Americans are very warm and hospitable people and leaving that culture has proven difficult for me. Everyone in the U.S smiles at you, here if I smile at someone they look at me like I have three heads!

There are a lot of things I do like much better about Spain, though. For example, I love the city set up. I live in a small city, and even here everything is very condensed and walkable. I don’t need a car because I can walk anywhere I need to go, and if I need to leave the city I can take a train or a bus. It’s so much better than anything I’ve experienced in America. Also, Americans are pretty addicted to consumption. They feel like certain things are *necessities* when Spanish people consider them over-the-top luxury items. For example, almost no one in my area uses a clothes dryer, they hang their clothes outside. Almost no one has central air conditioning. Maybe they have a wall unit in one room of the house, but overall they just don’t worry about it (and it gets hella hot down here, they just all have marble floors and live in white buildings to keep it cooler inside than it is outside). I also like that their portion sizes at restaurants are much smaller. I feel like in the U.S, if someone goes into a restaurant they expect enough food to be uncomfortably full and then still take some home with them. 

Ultimately, there are great things about living in Spain, I just don’t think it’s for me. I’m an extrovert and I miss my family, my friends, and being able to have easy and casual conversations with strangers. Maybe I’ll try to return again one day after improving my Spanish on my own back in the U.S and see if it’s any better.

TL;DR - Americans are generally warmer and more welcoming than Spanish people and my Spanish kinda sucks, but Spain isn’t all bad and no one should decide it is based on my desire to return home."

Other countries have problems with race relations too, it’s just not as prominently displayed on TV. I currently live in a country that has very little racial diversity. There are some Asian immigrants here, and they literally get called racial slurs on the street. People here use black face and say the n-word like it’s nothing because many of them have never even met a black person before.

Of course, as others have noted, the flamenco they love isn’t the same as a typical tourist flamenco you might see someone performing for tips on the plaza in Seville or in a big tourist trap location, but nonetheless, the love for it is strong even in the youngest generations.

> What the others do on the show is in my opinion pretty twisted. More twisted than Joe Exotic,

I think you still haven’t come to terms with the fact that Joe Exotic very clearly used drugs to coerce young teenage boys into having sex with him.

It’s also interesting to me that the worst thing that can be said about Carol is that she allegedly murdered her husband (which is horrible), but just a moment ago you said murder was an “understandable drive” when referencing Joe. Why is it that when Joe pays someone to murder someone, it’s “understandable,” but when Carol (allegedly) murders someone, it’s “twisted”? 

> Furthermore, people have sympathy for Joe because he got some comeuppance for his feud with Carol as he basically went broke affording lawyer's fees.

You can have sympathy for people and still recognize they did very bad things that require serious consequences. 

> So...I dunno, I guess what I'm saying is Joe is the most complex of them. The others are just scumbags. He at least has some humanity behind his scumbag'ness. But I will agree, they all belong in jail. How the fed let Jeff escape a prison sentence is beyond me.

You can’t adequately say that Joe is the *most* complex person in the series. The series was, more or less, *about* Joe. We know him inside and out. Everyone else was supporting cast. All of these people are complex, like you and I are. They just don’t have seven-episode docuseries telling us about all their emotional baggage and giving us things to sympathize with.

If I were to base people’s’ relative “complexity” on my immediate knowledge, I’d say that you are significantly less complex than Joe Exotic. I doubt that’s accurate, but I know very little about you and I know a lot about him. 

> If we're going to get into the nitty-gritty philosophy of the series, I think you're oversimplifying the dichotomy between these people.

Back to your original statement: I think if anyone here is oversimplifying it is you. You are painting everyone who isn’t Joe as a “twisted” person with no internal struggles or complexities, simply because you didn’t get to *see* those complexities. They all have good and bad within them, just like you and I do. These people (and I do mean *all* of these people), just seem to have acted on their bad more than we have."
TigerKing,fmknifs,t1_fmjpg0a,1586161296.0,"I’ve been on Reddit for a year and had no idea of that. I mean, it explains a lot because I’ve wondered many times about posts having no upvotes/downvotes even with a lot of comments. OP didn’t do anything wrong — they were just mistaken. I don’t see why *you’re* being a dick."
Chattanooga,fmkmq93,t1_fmjeit9,1586160437.0,"I don’t know where you work, but my friend who works at Whole Foods said the same thing is happening there. Although, I believe this week they said that employees are *allowed to* now but it’s still frowned upon."
thebachelor,fmkmdrj,t1_fmkjry5,1586160064.0,"Carole Baskin *might have* killed her husband (emphasis on the might), but Joe Exotic literally (as previously stated) manipulated teenagers into having sex with and even MARRYING him by pumping them full of drugs. That’s absolutely repulsive. His sex cult was no different than Doc Antle’s except Doc’s victims were teenage girls and Doc is obviously smarter and wealthier. They all belong in prison. 

I don’t see how you can say he’s the “least bad.” Also, murder for hire is an absolutely atrocious crime. It doesn’t make it okay because you *also* hate that bitch Carole Baskin. 

It sucks that Joe is the only one in prison — especially because we know it’s probably only because he’s the poorest of them all — but that doesn’t absolve him of anything. I’ll say it again: they *all* belong in prison."

thebachelor,fmjbgix,t1_fmgjnp2,1586126906.0,"I’m also non-religious and I deliberately did not watch her live because I saw a bunch of Christian reading material on her story earlier followed by a panel that said “and we’ll chat about it later at 8pm!” or something along those lines and then another that said “I understand this isn’t everyone’s thing, but I hope you understand that it is one of my things!” (again, paraphrasing). It seemed clear to me that the live was going to be religious in nature well in advance, so I’m not yet why you feel like you were misled or “tricked.”

Edit: phrasing"

thebachelor,fmclzqg,t1_fmclwpq,1585948244.0,Okay well I just googled it and it took 5 seconds for me to see that it takes 6 weeks to fully recover from a rhinoplasty and ATFR aired on March 10.
thebachelor,fmclsa0,t1_fmcln1f,1585948129.0,"Maybe she has had it done before the show, but do you legitimately think that there’s a possibility of her having had and fully recovered from a nose job since ATFR? I don’t care if she’s had work done. I’m just saying that your nose is the single trait on your face that is easiest to alter with angles, make up, and lighting."
thebachelor,fmclk8c,t1_fmclge2,1585948004.0,No of course not! It’s her body. She should get a nose job if she wants — no skin off my back. I just don’t like the habit this sub has of speculating about women’s bodies. It’s frustrating.
thebachelor,fmcjtoe,t1_fmcja86,1585947052.0,Idk have you never taken a photo and said “does my nose really look like that??” because I do every time I take one from a certain angle

Noses look different at different angles. Look at yourself in your front-facing camera head on and then look at yourself with your face turned slightly in each direction (left, right, up, down). It will look different."

Birmingham,fmbou4v,t1_fmbjrqj,1585930483.0,"Happy cake day! I think it might be because the victim is less able to defend themselves in a seated and buckled position in a vehicle? I don’t know for sure, but a murder where the victim is inside a vehicle is specifically listed in Alabama’s penal code as a capital crime."
Birmingham,fmbon3a,t1_fmbjhxh,1585930380.0,"In Alabama, one of the types of murder that is considered capital is one in which the victim is inside a vehicle at the time. Probably because the victim is less able to defend themselves in a seated and buckled position inside a vehicle. It’s weird, but it’s literally one of the conditions listed in AL’s penal code.
