And I have no idea why, My mind does this automaticaly, and it makes me feel like an awful person because I dont know what to do. That is the way I have been treated all my life and I learned to react that way.

No one realized how harmful it could have been for me back then. When someone shows sings of being sligthly nervous or in a bad mood I instantly become extremely angry and hipersensitive.

When someone cares about me, when they say they will listen, belive, support and understand me its like Im a child again, I become sad and cry, I become sensitive and vulnerable because I want to feel the patience and help I didnt have when I was a child.

I hear you and I understand you, I was also a sexually abused kid who is angry, Im angry at everything, so you have to vent the anger someway, I want to learn kickboxing

But seriously, Of course CSA its a major trigger for both of us, and why people always ask about the things YOU did or did not make, no one asks you about your abusers, about how they ruined your life, They want you to justify being angry
