You'd probably want to ask for ""blotter"" which is obviously only ever used to refer to hits laid on blotter paper.

Unfortunately, street blotter is usually underdosed, regardless of what the seller says. You're unlikely to get an accurately dosed hit unless you somehow find yourself at a GD concert or something, lol. So dont get discouraged if it doesn't feel right the first time, just keep adjusting your dose until you find something that makes you feel how you want it to.

If you can find liquid LSD, that would be the best to use since you dont have to worry about it being laid inconsistently. You still dont known if it's underdosed, but you'd probably have so much LSD that you can take your time finding the right dose."

Addy didn't do that work for you, you did that work. Your work isn't trivialized because you did it on stimulants.

I've got ADD as a result of 15 years of untreated severe depression. I basically can barely read without being on stimulants. I had a lot of trouble with doing my work at college because my brain fog was so bad that it basically made me nearly illiterate. I had to read the same sentence like 6-7 times just to understand what the words meant. Stimulants helped me function like a normal person, but it's not a cure. I take like 40mg mydayis, drink 4 cups of black coffee, and chainsmoke just to be able to stay focused during the day, and sometimes it still doesnt work and i ended up taking a 5 hour nap.

The *only* thing that ever completely lifted my brain fog and made me feel like how i did when i was a kid, before depression ruined my brain, was magic mushrooms.

I remember a 3.5g trip ending and i felt so weird and i didnt know what was different and i realized how easy it was to just think thoughts. I realized thats how normal people think. I looked at my notes and the math i had so much trouble understanding made sense instantly. I was so used to playing life on hard mode that being reset to normal made life feel super easy. 

That trip permanently reduced my depression (still have it, but its not as bad). Now i microdose mushrooms and it helps me focus and think and not be so hard on myself all the time. I'm not at all exaggerating when i say i can focus more on mushrooms than >100mg of addy. You also dont have to deal with the side effects of stims like having a 120 pulse 20 hours a day and wanting to step into traffic when they wear off.

If you've never tried psychedelics before, I'd reccomend looking into them. I've been on so many medications, went to so many therapy appointments, went to so many doctors, and none of it helped anywhere near as much as a single dose of mushrooms.

If you research it and think it might help, I'd say atleast try it once. It helped me so much and im really glad i found it."

If you practice drawing the snout with a more box-like structure it might look more like how you want it to.

Really excellent work though, well done.

Edit: forgot to say:

You draw your fur with continuous strokes (kind like wiggly lines). You might wanna try using one stroke in, and one stroke out for each tuft of hair. If you imagine how a shark's fine looks, it's kinda like that motion.

Then you can vary the curvature and size of the tufts as you go and overlap a couple.

That will give the fur more depth and give the illusion of volume.

When you draw the fur as wiggly lines in one stroke, you get rounded ends to the tufts and it can make the tufts look like ""layers"" of fur instead of clumps and tufts, which can flatten the drawing, especially around the outline of the piece.

The pointed tips you get when you use two strokes will likely give a more natural look compared to using single wiggly strokes.

Really great work so far though. I only work digitally and I wish I could draw with a pen like that lol."

SiegeAcademy,fqz42wh,t3_glblns,1589759551.0,"I would say it's only bad to main ops if you aren't playing with a squad. If you play with a group consistently, it's probably better to main a role and get good with 2-3 ops in that role so you can be effective even if ban phase goes poorly or if you need to adjust for the map.

In my group, i'm designated entry fragger on offense and roaming shotcaller on defense.

My other teammates take up roles like support/flex on offense, and support roamer/anchor on defense (we also have an anchor shotcaller).

So for offense i usually play Nøkk (gadget on, brain off, make people die so my team can get to obj safely and with advantage) but i can also play other ops that can fit this role like Ash, Blitz, Sledge, etc.

On defense, i usually play Cav (shot call my 1-2 other roamers, go for kills on separated attackers, relieve obj pressure, communicate with anchor shotcaller) but i also play Oryx and Ela for this role.

You don't need to be able to flex every op super well provided you can play a couple ops in your role very well.

This only really works if you play in a 5 stack though. Like i know i'll never have to anchor or play support (which i'm not super good at) because that's my teammates designated role. My friendlies also know they don't have to roam or entry frag, cause that's my role.

With randoms, you might have 5 anchors or 5 fraggers and somebody has to flex a role they're bad at, which isn't optimal, but then again you're playing with randoms and nothing is optimal lol."

25I-NBOME is usually pretty easy to identify because it wont show up as genuine on an ehrlich test and also has a really identifiable taste. It's extremely bitter and is usually uncomfortable to even have in your mouth. Its also only active sublingually, so if you aren't sure, you can just swallow the tabs and if its 25I they won't do anything (genuine LSD25 is active both sublingually and orally).

There are other LSD25 substitutes to watch out for (DOx series, for example) but you should be able to find them with an Ehrlich test.

If you're thinking about trying psychedelics, I'd reccomend starting with maybe 150ug of genuine tested acid. Mushrooms have a stronger headspace that might be uncomfortable for someone who isn't used to what psychedelics feel like.

LSD25 has more visuals and a less intense headspace.

If you wanna ""practice"" beforehand, you can try smoking a ton (like, a fucking huge amount) of weed and itll feel a little bit like a low psychedelic dose (cause weed is a very mild psych).

You don't really have to be worried about dying from bad tabs, just buy a few and test them to make sure they're safe, same as any other recreational drug. 

Of course, always research what you're doing before you do it, follow the reccomended safety guidelines (like having a tripsitter), and try to enjoy your first trip!"

fatlogic,fpl3clp,t1_fpl083i,1588705637.0,"Yeah, it's not very good to drink caffeine on stimulants, normally.

I don't just have ADHD though, I've simply had severe depression for a long time (~15 years) and my brain is a bit damaged from that. It gave me memory problems and fairly bad mental fog, along with pretty much permanent fatigue.

I'm already at like ~40mg a day of mydayis and the max it goes to is 50mg I believe (mydayis is 3:1 dex:lex ratio equivalent). I also frequently take breaks from my meds (weekends usually) because my insurance is quite bad and wont cover it, so its expensive to take everyday.

The breaks keep my tolerance down a little bit so the stims work better as well. It makes doing stuff on the weekends harder because I end up staring off into space for an hour at a time but it's alright I guess.

I don't like taking stimulants because I know it's definitely causing harm to my brain, but it's incredibly hard for me to work without them. I drink coffee because caffeine (while still not great) is a bit better for your brain.

It's frustrating because the only thing that I know of that completely lifts my mental fog is psilocyn (magic mushrooms), and that's still schedule 1 and will probably remain that way for atleast another 5 years at the minimum. Psilcyn is already approved as safe for human consumption by the FDA and used to treat depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADHD in other countries, but I still can't have it unfortunately.

I can literally focus better on a tiny dose of mushrooms (with no percieved side effects) better than >100mg mydayis.

On days i need to work a very long time (like approaching 24 hours straight work) i take mydayis throughout the day (like 2-3) times to i can keep working properly. I literally hate it so much. It makes me sweat, get agitated easily, all i wanna do is smoke cigarettes, i have a 120 pulse the whole time etc.

If I could just be prescribed psilocyn I could literally have tons of energy, be totally calm, no mental fog, and make my depression stop bullying me all day. It's so frustrating that I'm forced to take these awful stimulants that hurt me and still dont totwlly fix the problem, but the drug that could help me the most and do the least harm will land me a 10 year jail sentence.

Doom,fpkn62n,t1_fpjdros,1588697631.0,"Small lore bit:

Doomguy is significantly less powerful against anything that isn't demonic or more generally anything that doesn't contain argent energy.

The praetor suit's functions are powered by argent energy, the most important of which is the suits ability to repair itself and heal Doomguy. The suit has receptors near the gloves that attract argent energy and disperse it throughout the suit.

This is important because demons are literally argent piñatas. Demons are the twisted husks of damned humans, who had their soul removed and turned into argent. The demons still contain some amount of argent to animate them which is released upon their death. Doomguy is literally powered by the death of the demons he kills.

Doomguy is still a very capable combatant without his suit though, he killed the titan in Argent D'nur without it or the Seraph's blessing using only a crucible sword.

But he would likely have trouble fighting hordes of xenos or other demon-like enemies if they don't contain argent.

Alternatively, you could just go and capture demons and intentionally release them into combat with Doomguy. This would allow him to kill the actual enemies and take intermittent breaks to kill demons and heal himself. You could also kill the demons beforehand, store the argent, then supply Doomguy with it mid-battle. 

Provided Doomguy does not run out of Argent energy to heal himself, he's very nearly unkillable. Doomguy was crowned a warrior king for his combat prowess, blessed by the Seraphs with inhuman speed, agility, and total uncorruptability, is wearing self-healing armor, and carries like a dozen different weapons around with him everywhere he goes.

\* it's also worth noting that some of Doomguy's weapons (namely the BFG) have no effect on anything that doesn't contain argent. The BFG works by launching a huge ball of argent plasma that dumps itself into any nearby being that can store argent. It overloads them with argent plasma and causes them to explode. The BFG could only harm something that didn't contain argent if the main plasma ball contacted the target. This is actually how the pistol from Doom(2016) works, it shoots tiny bits of argent plasma. So against non-demonic enemies the BFG is basically just a very large handgun."
fatlogic,fpkk1dy,t3_gdzz54,1588696069.0,"Idk if this is the right place to ask this, but:

Does anyone know how much ADHD meds effect maintenance calories?

According to Like 5 different online calculators, my maintenance should be ~2700-2800 a day (M/6'1"",170lb).

I tried dieting a bit for my health (1700 a day for a week, intended to lose maybe 2lb). But after 7 days i had lost ~5lbs. Im pretty sure i'm tracking my calories properly, but i did the maths and my maintenance should be like 4k a day which is insane considering I only do strength training for like 30 minutes a day usually, and i think i only trained twice this last week due to other obligations.

Im prescribed stimulants for my adhd and i drink black coffee all day, is that really driving my maintenance up to 4k a day or am i just counting calories wrong and only eating a tiny bit?"

depression,fpier07,t1_fpgtvge,1588639405.0,"Mate, you shouldn't worry about ""needing pills"" to stay normal.

Most all prescriptions have positives and negatives, but the whole point is to find one where the positives outweigh the negatives and are worth taking.

Also, taking medication doesn't make you ""crazy"" or your happiness ""fake"". You've got an illness and it's normal to try to fix such things. 

When somebody loses their legs and we give them a wheelchair it's not ""fake mobility"". When we do dental work you don't have a ""fake smile"".

Your brain simply isn't working properly and doing something to fix it and experiencing life how you were supposed to is more ""real"" than living with a debilitating illness.

Ive had severe depression for 15 years, i've had it for so long it's given me horrible mental fog. I have a hard time just talking to people or reading text without being on heavy prescription stimulants. I'm close to the max im allowed to be prescribed and the fog is still significant most days.

But i know that me on enough amphetamines to give most people a heartattack is worth living life how it was meant to be for me.

Im not meant to be nearly illiterate. In 9th grade my cognition was already crushed by depression and i had a 130 iq, 5 years later it was a 104 from so much mental fog. When im not medicated it feels like im permanently hungover, i can barely think. I know that's not right, i'm not supposed to be like that. Taking medication is supposed to be a tool to make your life how you think it ought to be, it's not some horrible, shameful thing."

LibertariansBelieveIn,fpe1z64,t1_fpdyznh,1588538759.0,"Libertarianism is a political focus on freedom, if you use the socialist definition of freedom (right to leisure, healthcare, or whatever else and particular socialist sect deems a right essential to freedom) then I suppose libertarian socialism can exist.

However, as this definition of freedom would conflict with a right libertarians definition, the two would not see each other's views as ""libertarian"".

It's the same reason right and left anarchists like to say the other side isn't real anarchy. They're using the same definition of anarchy (an absence of involuntary hierarchies) but with varying definitions of ""involuntary hierarchies"". Both sides are anarchists as they meet the central definition of anarchism, but each side cannot view the other as legitimate.

In conclusion, libertarian socialism is not oxymoronic, it uses the same definition as right libertarianism, but ""freedom"" is defined differently.

Both groups are libertarian, but neither group is libertarian using their counterpart's definition."
