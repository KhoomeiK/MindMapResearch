SuicideWatch,fd6gkbd,t3_ejysqk,1578190672.0,"I just want to tell you *all* that, even though I don't know you, I love you! I can relate so hard to everything that's been said and wish a lot of the time that I could just stop existing. I know I can't do anything though because it would break my wonderful partner and my lovely parents hearts. 
If I think about the future and the rest of my life, being in constant pain and doped up on morphine, and I want to cry so I just take each day as it comes. I find writing helps me a lot (with an actual pen and paper), I write out everything in my head and then read it back to myself. Sometimes I just burn it after but other times I keep it and come back to it in a few weeks/months time to remind myself that I kicked depressions arse that day. 
I wish you all peace and love xx
(Sorry if this doesn't make sense or is stupid.)"
