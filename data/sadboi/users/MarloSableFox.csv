CPTSD,fijnuqg,t1_fij4ff9,1582456828.0,Thank you so much for this. I really appreciate this.
CPTSD,figlykc,t3_f7wkm9,1582401170.0,Thanks for sharing. Can you please share how you were able to unlock this inner anger? It’s (anger) something I recently realised I have but I’m having trouble feeling safe enough to express it.

ENFP,fdeqrki,t1_fdeqo71,1578344652.0,We’re all weird as hell. But also incredibly wonderful 💛🌈
ENFP,fdeoj09,t3_eky576,1578343344.0,I honestly relate so much with introvert meme and stereotypes. Love people but I’m horribly self critical in pretty much any social situation. Exhausting much?!
mentalhealth,fde7pda,t3_ekwr19,1578332998.0,At least three times a week haha
mentalhealth,fde7g6t,t3_eksmad,1578332842.0,"Sis, you deserve a better husband. Anxiety and depression are no joke. You deserve a solid support system. I’m so sorry you have to go through this."
ENFP,fd68gok,t1_fd670gh,1578187097.0,I agree. I’m often a nervous wreck but noone ever notices. It can be very isolating to not feel seen.
ENFPpenpals,fd22c2j,t3_eazcoc,1578140588.0,"Are your requirements location bound? I’m London, UK bound. 33. 1 child. Messy breakup (no divorce), budding entrepreneur."
ENFPmemes,fcyoaf6,t3_e2b6r2,1578083788.0,I honestly screamed with laughter. This is soooo me 😩
ENFP,fcxw9t7,t3_ejdek7,1578071355.0,"From my experience (and lots of anecdotal evidence) this type of relationship is common for is ENFPs. We are trusting, accommodating and forgiving. We are also brilliant idealists and we use this trait to hold on to people and situations. These traits are often used by some people to manipulate and abuse us. My only advice is to look after yourself. Mentally, spiritually, emotionally. Seek refuge in people who see you for who you are, and don’t wish to exploit it. If you’re bound by this contractual agreement, use your Ne-Te to make a plan for when you can leave. Imagine what your life could look like and take steps towards making it. Don’t forget to consult Fi-Si, these keep us living authentically and stop us repeating past mistakes. Good luck."

AmItheAsshole,espz849,t1_espbpc8,1562192590.0,Noted! Thank you
AmItheAsshole,espz2w1,t1_espbjwg,1562192515.0,"My point exactly. The whole break up, she didn’t reach out once. I tried to open up the lines of communication and I wish I hadn’t."
AmItheAsshole,espyy9w,t1_esp9g81,1562192450.0,Thank you! I thought I was being irrational and hypersensitive.
mentalillness,esourj6,t3_c8o8aq,1562174528.0,"Well done for seeking help! Just be aware when seeing a new therapist, make sure you ask them questions you feel are important to you. Things like their professional background and training, how they are suited to help you with your problem/s and why they are doing the job they do. If you don’t gel with your therapist, it’s totally ok to seek a new one. Remember the process is about you and not everyone will be equipped to help you with your issues. It’s ok to be picky. Good luck and I hope it goes well!"
mentalillness,esot7bi,t3_c8ljy5,1562173813.0,Precisely 😭
AmItheAsshole,eskjinl,t3_c87w74,1562066382.0,NAH you’re mother is protecting you little sister as a parent should. You were also looking out for her because you care and wanted to see her happy (and content with ice cream). Maybe in future you take her with you. You do hear all sorts of horror stories about kids left alone with people they trust and awful things happen. Just use your best judgment.
mentalhealth,eshjr1b,t3_c7trjz,1561994601.0,"You’re not alone! This is a common struggle and the fact you’re willing to share is a step in the right direction. Do you have family members, friends or colleagues you can talk to? Quite often we convince ourselves that no-one cares but sharing the problem really helps. I often find people are a lot more kind and compassionate than I give them credit for in my head. Therapy definitely helped me in seeking help and forming a support network. You are not struggling alone 💛"
MentalHealthBuddies,eshhvlp,t3_c708y4,1561993299.0,"Well done for getting help and sticking with therapy. You got this! 💪🏾 I have bipolar 2, OCD and cPTSD all rolled into one and every day can seem like a challenge. I’m also on meds and in therapy so this helps a lot. You’re doing a great job x"
AmItheAsshole,esgzmin,t3_c7pvxd,1561975512.0,NAH you both have very different values; I don’t think you should even be together if you cannot agree on basic things like morals.
endometriosis,esgxjt5,t1_es91nzm,1561972269.0,Ergh I can relate. It’s so humiliating trying to explain that your womb doesn’t play ball. Even worse when you have a woman boss or supervisor who is not empathetic.
AskWomen,esfc1ed,t3_c7er52,1561922306.0,"Yes, I use pitrok and I haven’t looked back. It’s great and effective."
AskWomen,esf20v8,t3_c7er52,1561915200.0,I use PitRok crystal deodorant. I’ve had my stick for three years and still have plenty. Cost me roughly £5 ($6) and works great. Doesn’t clog pores but prevents funky underarms.
