From this helpful book called ‚ÄúThe Upward Spiral: Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression One Small Change at a Time‚Äù by Alex Korb:

‚ÄúWhile trying to be grateful, it might be enticing to simply compare yourself to people who are less fortunate. Sure, you might not have a new car, but some people don‚Äôt have a car at all. This may seem like the same thing as gratitude, but it‚Äôs not. And studies show that comparing yourself to the less fortunate does not have the same benefits as gratitude. Gratitude is showing actual appreciation for the things you have. It does not matter what other people do or do not have. Gratitude is powerful because it decreases envy and increases how much you value what you already have, which improves life satisfaction. Take a deep breath. A nice long one, through your nose. At the top of your breath, pause for a moment to think, ‚ÄúI am grateful for this breath,‚Äù then let it out slowly. Furthermore, comparing yourself to others activates circuits responsible for social comparison. Sure, you might come out favorably in some scenarios, but definitely not in all scenarios. In addition, the way your brain determines how other people think is that it takes what it‚Äôs thinking and projects it outward. If you do lots of social comparisons, you‚Äôre more likely to assume other people are engaging in social comparisons about you, and that can make you feel judged and excluded. On the other hand, showing gratitude, kindness, and compassion toward others activates more positive social circuits. And when you feel these emotions toward other people, you‚Äôre more likely to assume that other people are feeling the same about you.‚Äù"
BipolarReddit,fg86m8x,t1_fg3d9yn,1580610904.0,"I think it helps to avoid comparing all together. Everyone is different And has different circumstances. Even if someone appears to be successful in the outside, everyone has their struggles."
