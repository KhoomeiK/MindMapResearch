On the other hand, if the person in question isn't interesting, or their story is boring, I usually think about something else and occasionally key in with something they said that I picked up on the side."

Sometimes it’s something that has nothing to do with you or the person just needs space. This girl and I had plans to go on a trip together and she ghosted a few weeks before until after the trip date because she didn’t know how to say she didn’t want to go. 
Sometimes it happens. It’s not the end of the world and you still have a chance to work things out with the person at hand (girl and I did and now we’re close again). 

If it’s constantly on your mind, late low for a bit and then approach them casually. Try starting a conversation about what happened (try to avoid confrontation though) and how it made you feel. Best of luck to you!"

WorldOfWarships,fegd1ru,t1_fegcbs3,1579088288.0,"A system I entertained the thought of involved lowing the effectiveness of wings due to aa. If multiple wings are attacking a target, the aa does significantly more damage to the planes. Or something where priority aa causes planes to perform evasive maneuvers and increases the spread of the drop. 
The problem being there’s a fine line between balance and nerfing too harshly. 

I just don’t like the first person piloting and dropping of the new CV’s. The old RTS mechanic was a gorgeous and unique method of play it just needed major tweaking. Most ships could be curb stomped and on the flip side some have so much aa that they were impossible to approach

The good thing about RTS is crossdropping which is a legit strategy that’s much harder to do now."

In addition to that, you can speak to an adviser or whoever handles admissions for the med school you want to go to and explain what happened. That's what I did for my architecture major and it was fine. Taking the initiative can do a lot for getting you in
