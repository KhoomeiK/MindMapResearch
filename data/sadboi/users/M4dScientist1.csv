Damn, so when you were tapering you were still taking tablespoon doses when you jumped off? You were basically taking a tablespoon morning afternoon and after dinner? See, I gotta get to that point, cause right now I’m in pretty strong withdrawal if I haven’t dosed in 6 hours. I would like to get down to teaspoon doses though.

But yeah I’ve been trying to stay busy, I just have no interest in doing anything. Kratom has taken all of my motivation to do anything. It’s hard to get myself to do anything.

quittingkratom,fpjf1ap,t1_fpiyb0c,1588666113.0,"Yeahhh, I dunno man. I’ve went cold turkey off of Kratom before and it lasted 29 days. N I don’t mean 29 days of annoying withdrawal symptoms. I mean 29 days of HELL.

My withdrawal actually peaked in weeks 2-3, and during that time I could not sit still for ONE second. I had to go for runs at 4 am in the dead of winter when it was 20 degrees, immediately come home n do pushups to failure, then sit in an extremely hot epsom salt bath, n even that only gave me about 45 minutes of relief before I was writhing around on the floor in agony again. Driving to work and pounding my legs with my fists until they were bruised because not being able to move them because of the rls.

Lots of people say 3 days, and I understand im a unique case, due to health issues I have and because of the amount I was taking, over 100 gpd, but it was anything but just a couple days of being uncomfortable"

It’s something therapy (in my case) can’t help. Something medication (in my case) can’t help. Something healthy diet and exercise can’t help. I just don’t know what I’m going to do to keep myself from wanting to blow my brains out. Kratom has been my escape but I also know at this point it is definitely contributing to my depression."
quittingkratom,fphp1ho,t1_fphoh5y,1588625184.0,"To each his own. I definitely agree with what you’re saying to an extent. Withdrawal for me cold turkey lasted 29 days. N I mean an intense 29 days, like no sleep, restless arms n legs that drove me to the edge of sanity, anxiety, n depression that I’m lucky to have made it out of.

So for me, I’m just trying to get as low as I possibly can to soften that blow, cause I’m scared of what’s to come."
quittingkratom,fphooms,t1_fpho6qn,1588625001.0,"Eh I appreciate the support but na man, clinical depression is a real bitch. I was a ragingggg alcoholic for 15 years and got sober n was the most miserable fuck on the face of the earth, that’s why I started using Kratom. But I dunno, hopefully thingsll be different this time.

You’re an unusual addict in that sense. Most addicts use to self medicate. You’re not self medicating anything, I guess you just really enjoy getting high haha"
quittingkratom,fphnrev,t1_fphn0k9,1588624529.0,"Yeahhh that’s why we’re drug addicts lol.

I get the same feeling as you, though I’m not so much worried about who I am, as I worry about my state of mind sober. I know why I’m a drug addict, n it’s because I’m miserable when I’m sober. I’m scared to get off again because I feel like I’m going to get to that point again where I’m like “this is what sobriety is like? Fuck this, I’m soooo miserable.”

I’ve had a couple years of sobriety before and went to AA and did the whole deal. But I was so fucking unhappy n that’s why I turned to Kratom. I’m just scared of getting to that place again. Smh...."

N yeah, to each his own, but I think for people to claim it’s easy is wreckless, especially when looking at the minuscule doses they were taking. But that’s awesome man, to be feeling better by day 4 is huge. You must have strong adrenals, cause usually coming off cold turkey, your cortisol levels are going to be through the rooooof which can take a couple of weeks to stabilize."
quittingkratom,fphjegl,t1_fphiv8l,1588622323.0,Cold turkey is extremely difficult. I’ve never done it successfully but I’m just trying to get as low as I can possibly go before jumping off this time.

I actually just thought I had stomach cancer, so I thought I was going to have to come off of Kratom again because I was getting sick everytime I dosed, but I’ve since gotten medication that’s made things much better so now I’m tapering.

How long have you been off??"
quittingkratom,fphhxin,t1_fphh45d,1588621587.0,"Yup. I actually laugh. Like oh boo hoo, withdrawal must’ve been sooooo tough with your whole 10 gpd habit. Like you said, these people are going an entire day off a tablespoon n a half when I take doses bigger than that.

I’ve come off 100 gpd cold turkey before and I can’t even begin to put into words how excruciating it actually was. I’ve come off benzos and alcohol cold turkey once before and I would rather do that 5 times over than do Kratom withdrawal one time."
quittingkratom,fphhlub,t1_fphgzfc,1588621424.0,"You have seizures from Kratom? I’ve heard of people having that but I didn’t know if that was a real thing. Wtf happens??

N yeah, I mean, those people are just ignorant. It’s like comparing people who drink two beers every night for 3 months vs the alcoholic who’s been doing a bottle of vodka atleast everyday for years. No shitttttt the withdrawal wasn’t hard! You’re barely addicted!

But yeah, I quit once cold turkey, off of 100 gpd n I can’t even begin to explain the hell that was every second of my entire life."
quittingkratom,fpg3o50,t3_gd8vly,1588593261.0,"Good luck man.

I know that feeling. I’m tapering myself right now but my biggest fear about jumping off is that gut wrenching depression I KNOW I’ll inevitably be consumed by. I went cold turkey once off 125 gpd and I made it 60 days but I couldn’t deal with that fuckin depression.

castiron,fodj2ik,t1_fodiax6,1587685313.0,Ok sounds good thanks again
castiron,fodhgvl,t1_fodfjoe,1587684744.0,"Okay cool good to know.

So you wash your pan n then heat it on the stove n then season. N then the next time you cook something you add more oil to the pan before cooking? I haven’t found that a layer of seasoning has any nonstick capability. Maybe that’s just me"
castiron,fodh5ov,t1_fodf84y,1587684632.0,"Ahh okay thanks for the explanation. I’ve used soap two times and I’ve gotten paranoid that it was doing something to the pan.

Also, good to know that I should always use grease or oil when cooking with cast iron. I always thought the advantage of cast iron was that you season it after washing n that acts as your nonstick material but that doesn’t seem to be the case for me lol"
castiron,foddq4j,t1_fodcrg0,1587683408.0,Ok thanks appreciate the info
castiron,fodcfev,t1_fodbrxm,1587682932.0,"I have one of those stainless steel chainmail scrubbers that’s good at getting any of the bits off and I would think would help smooth it out. 

So far now, should I just add butter or oil before cooking anything in it? If I dry/season after cleaning I don’t find the surface to be particularly nonstick. Maybe I’m doing something wrong though.

N I keep finding widely different theories on soap. What is yours? Lol"

funny,fo5yfa0,t1_fo5xpzs,1587539849.0,"Damn man, I’m really sorry that fucking sucks. If it makes you feel any better the cdc website posts the amount of deaths per age bracket nationwide, n 25-134 is only 160 deaths nationwide, and 35-44 only goes up about another 150. I’m the same age as you. The chances of someone our age dying from this is very small, and granted you are experiencing it firsthand, but it’s extremely unlikely and don’t worry for yourself too much. Just stay safe man. N mourn however you need to mourn. Feel better brother"

And especially when you consider all the fuckin trump lovers who buy into his nonsense and run around like this is all being blown out of proportion are crazy. Those people will be the cause of the second wave that comes. I hate to say it but I’m trying to come to grips with the fact that I may lose someone else I know to this too. This is all fucked. I hope your mom is okay. I’m sure you’ll forget after tonight but keep me updated, ok?"

My grandfather had passed years ago n I know right now shed be losing her mind watching everything that’s going on. I think she’s at peace now.

We couldn’t see her in the hospital, so she went from the hospital, straight to a casket, and then put into the ground. We couldn’t have a funeral, just a few of us crowded around the hole in the ground. Strange times."
