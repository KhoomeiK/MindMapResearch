The tips people have given here are really good. But if you just aren't comfortable with that and don't want to you absolutely should not do it. It's okay to want to do it because she likes it, but if you truly don't want to you should tell her that."
sex,fj1liy1,t1_fj0po7t,1582922579.0,"Violence means/is associated with anger/hate/wanting to hurt the person. Violence is more like literally beating your partner black and blue, actually throwing them, rape, slapping their face too hard, choking as in cutting off all air supply dangerously/till they pass out doing things they don't like/that are a hard no, genuinly hard foreplay and sex, etc. In a relationship it has connotations with abuse.

Rough is more pushing them around physically, yanking their hair back, spanking them, choking them (more about restricting air rather than actually choking the person), pushing them up against a wall, manhandling them, biting them, holding their hair during a blowjob, etc. Some of these can be both violent and rough with different contexts, consent, and intents. CNC (consent non consent) belongs more in the rough category because it's consensual but can have some violent tendancies sometimes if any of this makes sense?

Obviously consent and you know, not killing the person are the important things here. Anything rough can 100% turn into violence at any time without consent. Some people might like things more on the violence side and that's okay as long as they consent. Also some things that are more violent aren't necessarily violent in the sense of intent to hurt them/might not HURT hurt them if they like it.

EDIT: I meant to add a side note that dominance/submission can be separate from roughness or violence. Things that are dominant but not rough for example are: cradling their neck/chin/cheek, holding their arms above their head, running a hand down their skin (especially if you look at them the right way), holding/gripping their hips, raising their chin, speaking in demands/with authority, certain looks that are known by the other, groping them (gently or not), sticking your fingers in their mouth, holding a hand over their mouth, getting on top of them, pushing them against a wall, holding their face down while you kiss their neck, gentle smacks, and wrapping their hair around your hand. (Another side note- some of these like gentle snacks could be classified as more rough if the person defines it like that for them personally.)

I hope at least some of this made sense!"

EatingDisorders,ffg6z04,t3_eskx8y,1579899796.0,I second seeing a nutritionist but make sure it's one who is qualified to treat eating disorders! I'd also suggest a therapist (one who is knowledgeable about eating disorders) because they can help you work through not only your body image issues but your confusion about anorexia and they can give you an honest profile answer. You should see a psychiatrist who can confirm your diagnosis or not.
EatingDisorders,ffg6kzh,t1_ffe4vm8,1579899555.0,"Definitely this! Not sure how you (OP) feel about this but maybe be careful with banning junk food from your house. Moderation is important- everyone wants what they ""can't"" have, so if you ban junk food you might start to want it more and recovery isn't supposed to be able limiting your diet like that (imo, everyone is different!

retailhell,ffg5mvc,t1_ffg5a6k,1579898971.0,"Another point I'd like to make is that skincare products are expensive and a lot definitely cost more than they're worth/it cost to make. 

As for the ""be a decent human being"" part, I know a lot of people in retail who are pretty lazy and actually don't want to do their job. It's also a bit rude to declare that people who just want to browse are not decent human beings."
retailhell,ffg5a6k,t1_ffdzspp,1579898757.0,"That's what I was thinking. How is it rude to say you're just looking? Most people genuinely just want to look. Maybe they have social anxiety or get socially anxious sometimes. Maybe they know what products work for their skin (because not everyone is uneducated in that area, especially if they're a frequent skincare product buyer) and they're just browsing/considering what they can afford and maybe they don't need you (op) to help them. There nothing wrong with that. I agree there's nothing wrong with the samples and the sale thing unless they're trying to take a ton of samples but some people don't want to justify/feel bad buying products and it's easier if it's on sale. Some of OP's points were just plain rude tbh."

From what I've heard most retail jobs suck at this stuff. We didn't have enough people during the holiday, which was not surprising and management needs to be better with scheduling and hiring. I was scheduled to work Thanksgiving day during the time my family would be eating dinner and would have had to work if my coworker hadn't agreed to take the later half of my shift. They won't give us more hours either (almost nobody in front end gets over 30 and they claim to have ""many full time positions open"" but won't give the people in those departments enough hours either) and the only reason I was getting around 20-24 when I first started was because my availability was literally almost any time, any day and now it's not so they scheduled me for 12 hours this week. I think the mothers/fathers day thing is great."

I didn't work Christmas day because we were closed but I worked christmas eve in the early morning until we closed at 6 pm and I worked thanksgiving day and nobody except the managers got holiday pay (which is literally only an extra dollar an hour) because they only give you holiday pay if you've been working there for 2+ years (which is bullshot). So no, not everyone gets holiday pay and everyone I know has plans to be with their family christmas night and some christmas eve as well (I do, since I have two sets of grandparents)."
retailhell,feiq4x0,t1_feinu5y,1579144429.0,I personally just always ask them for clarification. If they ask for everything to be double bagged I ask if they want just the heavy things double bagged or literally everything. Maybe the cashier assumed the customer meant heavy items. I try not to judge because I know retail workers are tired and deal with a lot of shit from customers and sometimes just don't think to do something because they're so tired but if someone has that attitude I would definitely complain to the higher ups.
retailhell,feiljb4,t1_feihzmd,1579141344.0,I don't think anyone was defending not double bagging. The OP implied they were actually going to double bag them.
retailhell,feilgku,t1_feihzmd,1579141292.0,Then I would complain to management/customer service because that's just rude of them.
retailhell,feib486,t1_fe5ptsz,1579134368.0,"I usually ask customers if they need their milk double bagged and if it's not a lot I'll ask if they want heavy things doubled but otherwise I just automatically double bag anything heavy/with pointed edges because our bags are even thinner now and I know it'll just break (unless the customer tells me ""I don't need anything double bagged""). But especially if you work in retail you should take into consideration that especially if the cashier is new it's not always their fault. I was told not to double bag unless the customer requested it. None of the managers have enforced that but obviously during my first month I was nervous and tried to follow all ridiculous rules to a t to avoid getting in trouble. It annoys me when whatever bagger is bagging for me doesn't double bag or ask or even check that the customer wants plastic so I get it. But I've had customers bitch about me not double bagging things that were absolutely light enough that they were fine. Managment would probably have a fit if we double bagged literally every single thing even if it was one item and didn't need it. I'm assuming you're nice to cashiers but a lot of people aren't. I don't understand why a cashier would be genuinely annoyed at having to double bag though. It's not hard and it takes one second so it's a bit ridiculous to be annoyed at that."
