Accutane,f50l5se,t1_f50iaf3,1571929078.0,"They obviously have not pursued further research because they want to keep selling the drug, and no it doesn’t make you lose interest in many things because you’re more tired it makes you lose interests because the orbitofrontal cortex is needed in having those interests, you probably get tired from them because they’re harder than they used to be"
Accutane,f50kxsl,t1_f50iaf3,1571928985.0,Dude if the same results show up for 13 people that’s not something to take lightly and nonetheless I’m asking if the 21% decrease in functioning can be reversed

Accutane,f4r81mn,t1_f4r2xmq,1571764083.0,"I personally think the accutane messed me up in having higher level interests and my concentration and attention, those effects of vitamin A toxicity seem like they fit me. I’m pretty sure the orbitofrontal cortex is responsible for guiding someone for high level things like schooling and your career and when it’s damaged for someone it seems like they don’t really take that type of stuff seriously and are more concerned with pleasure after."
Accutane,f4r0rjr,t1_f4qu4jv,1571760961.0,"You’re just coming up with bullshit reasons as to why it’s not definitive, how is a 20% change in a brain region not something to worry about?

Concussion,f4lwk1q,t1_f4ls283,1571672028.0,"Thank you for responding, I got a CT scan last night because I was worried about possible brain damage, but it showed up fine and the doctor said there was nothing wrong. Still though, I don’t know if a CT scan can really detect subtle changes that a concussion might cause. I was wondering if anyone knew from reference how big a concussion has to be for it to really leave a mark, and if a one time concussion would really leave a big impact on someone’s entire life. To be fair I’m probably just OCD and it’s gotten bad since I’ve had a lot of stress these past 2 years."
