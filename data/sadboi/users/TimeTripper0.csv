Although your situation may feel helpless, there is a wide world out there waiting to help and provide support for you, even in these desperate times. I second telling your teachers, they have processes in place to help students who have rough home lives. You can find peace, you just have to ask."
schizophrenia,fom75mk,t1_folw2v5,1587880281.0,"Just finished Undone. From an outside perspective (lurker, neurotypical), it really provides what seems like an understandable glimpse into the paranoia and psychosis a lot of people on this sub have to go through. It treats the subject with respect for all parties involved, which I think was well-balanced. It is also beautifully captured in a unique media format. Would highly recommend."

Man, the animosity in this chat is real towards him. Why? Isn’t that also divisive?  I’m really not a bad faith actor and can be convinced. Why is the Kyle hate real here? Why is he ‘delusional’? His points seem logical to me, if not always 100% consistent (normally those deviations also seem logical). I thought the left generally liked Kyle and his views; I am surprised by the vitriol here and somewhat confused.


Also love David!! Watch his show all the time. :)"

leaves,f7x17mw,t3_dxto6o,1574043542.0,"That’s dedication, friend. Good luck! Nicotine is the worst. I quit both after 4 years (weed) & 2 years (menthol cigs & swisher blunts). I don’t know how dedicated you are to this, or how much time you really have, but For what it’s worth, my experience was that it was very difficult to quit both at the same time (just being honest); I’d make it a couple weeks and then relapse and it just became a cycle. What I found worked for me was to quit weed first, really quit it, for like 2+months, while smoking cigs (limiting myself to a gradually shrinking few a day) and then pick up weed again and drop cigs (just switch completely one predetermined night). Nicotine was def. the hardest drug I’ve ever came off of and, frankly, being high made it easier and helped the craving. Eventually, I weaned myself off the weed by just gradually stepping down. 

Or try smokable CBD flower. I discovered that after I quit. Good luck! Keep your goal date and mind and don’t go for it when your mind says ‘just one hit.’"
