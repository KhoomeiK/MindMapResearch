food,fdj58r0,t1_fdj4o1k,1578458801.0,"Lol. Thank you. I make cornbread all the time! That's my jam. But yep, here's the recipe. :) 

Mix 4 cups flour, 2 tablespoons of baking powder, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 2 TEAspoons of salt.

Next add twelve tablespoons of butter. Make sure the butter is frozen solid, at least an hour in the freezer. Then, use a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the dry ingredients. If you don't have a pastry cutter, you can use a box grater to shred the butter and add it to the mixture.

Add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, whole milk, or even 2%.

Mix until dough.

Press dough into a flat sheet, then fold it 4-6 times to get layers. Lightly press again. Cut out biscuits with the top of a cup or glass jar.

Bake at 425° for about 12 minutes.

Happy baking!"
food,fdj4u87,t1_fdivkhw,1578458480.0,"I try to stay away from the rolling pin! I usually overwork the dough when I get it out. But yep, after folding, I press the layers together a bit one last time. I really don't know if it's necessary or just a habit. Lol. No perfect thickness necessary, as long as they are at least similar in size. I've thrown some pretty tall ones in with short ones, and they all still cooked together well. Hope that helped!"
food,fdj48sd,t1_fdj37ai,1578458023.0,"Hmm. Could be a few things. First reason that comes to mind is not enough baking powder. But, if you can cross that off the list, I'd make sure you aren't over-working the dough. It gets tough and heavy when you mess with it for too long. Lastly, make layers! Gently flatten the dough with your hands. and fold it over on itself 4-6 times before cutting!"

I coated some of them with some sea salt, and those ones didn't stick together at all! To get the squares, I just poured the caramel on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, popped it in the fridge for an hour, and then sliced it with a pizza cutter. Also, if it is still super sticky after it sets up, you might want to double check that it's done before taking it off the stove. Just take a scoop of the caramel mixture, and throw it in ice water. When it hardens immediately, it's done. Hope these tips can help you make some beautiful candies!"

OCPoetry,f8863nd,t3_dzbxm9,1574349224.0,"I love how well this poem flows. Reads like a book.  The imagery of the chattering shelves pulled me right in, and your seamless transitions kept me reading. 

I really liked these two lines:

""You look down at your plate, half-smile, halfway around the world"" 

""They look down at their plates, full-smile, and make the return trip."" 

Very clever! 

Also, one sure-fire way to signify the end of a meal is by asking ""Who wants dessert?"" So the ending felt absolutely perfect to me. Great job!Keep em' coming."
OCPoetry,f882pgs,t3_dyrl77,1574347484.0,"Love that you chose a small moment to represent something much bigger. As mundane as a trip to the grocery can be, you had me hooked from the beginning with the dragon hoard reference. All relationships have unique problems, but anyone in one can relate to this poem. I enjoyed reading your thoughts about the coffee creamer, eggs, and bread. Allowing your silent dialog to be shared with the reader was a nice touch. Well done."

As far as the leash training, I have been trying to get her off of one. I used to have a bloodhound who followed me everywhere, inside and out. I didn't have to train him to do it, we were just pals I guess. Lol. I've been trying to get the bully to do the same. So far, I can get her to stay on the porch with me for morning coffee, with no leash. Sometimes she'll run around and play in the front yard, and then come back to me. But I never bring her out when I know someone is coming. I should of used leash training for those scenarios, but I think putting her on one now might confuse her or make her think I don't trust her."
schizophrenia,f7nlup8,t1_f7nbky6,1573909874.0,"It sounds like she was able to get better while she was on her meds, so that's promising. When I was about seventeen, I had a breakdown, started seeing things, thinking people were coming to get me, and similar to her, thought people were trying to poison me. I didn't drink water until I had to, and became severely dehydrated with a kidney infection. I was too paranoid to admit to people how I got to that point, so it was another five years before I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Things got better for me, before they got worse. For a few years I was fine, but then had another breakdown, and started to barricade my doors, fearing the outside world. But I also thought that the spiders in my house were plotting against me, and I felt them crawling all over me. I don't know that there has ever been a darker time in my life. But I healed from that, too. And while having schizophrenia may make my days harder, I am not always stuck in that constant state of paranoia. And I don't suspect she will be, either. The fact that you are on here looking into her condition, trying to find what is wrong, shows me she has a great support system. Keep it up. That will help her tremendously in the long run. Just remember, sometimes her paranoia or delusions might be aimed in your direction. Please, please, do not take offense to that. The mind of a person in that condition can be a minefield, and you never quite know which words will set her off. Just be there with her, and if you don't know what to say, say nothing. Good luck to you and your family, I am sorry you guys are going through this."

Also fine with and around strangers when we go out somewhere. Huge cuddle bug, but always mad when someone gets here. Possibly because we live in the middle of nowhere, and don't get many visitors. She has never had to protect us from anyone in the driveway, so not sure why she has that reaction!"

It was a fast food joint, and I think she was just there because she was in need of a job quickly. I believe she works at some sort of factory now. I moved across state lines after I left the job, and lost contact with her shortly after. Didn't end on a bad note of any sort, just sort of drifted away. I always took a liking to her, and she seemed to be a decent person all around. So if I was going to be sensitive to someone emotions, I could see why it might be her!

She is known to go ""off the grid"" every once and a while. Lives out in the country, and isn't a huge fan of using the internet, her phone, that kind of stuff.
