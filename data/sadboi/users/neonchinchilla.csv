There are records of pastors for literally over a century stating exactly the same thing, it's been going on for that long.

The second and final church I attended was ""fine"" until we as teenagers were instructed to select a guild to join.

I was already one foot out the door from the church, I was in the closet and ready to be out and away from all of those people. But once I joined the *flower* guild I may as well have worn a rainbow target on my back. In hindsight, I should have known better.

gaybros,fjej1lf,t1_fje9stk,1583272606.0,"""Bury your gays"" is a popular trope unfortunately.

I'd like this story made accurately but I'd also like a few...more positive stories also told."
SapphoAndHerFriend,fjecy58,t1_fjdofbg,1583269564.0,"Ah shit, does your dick have diet cum? I'm on a diet."
me_irl,fjck2mq,t3_fcijo0,1583223413.0,"I did lose what I considered my spark. I had high highs and low lows and anti depressants made me lose both. I felt like a neurotic robot who just sat and stressed about every little detail and nothing mattered.

I'm an artist by both trade and hobby. To lose what makes me feel and be creative means death and after 4 rounds of different meds not succeeding I quit.

I'd like to try again but I'm not sure how. I exhausted most mainstream medications with only negative feedback."
OutOfTheLoop,fj7ciwf,t1_fj6pvip,1583089616.0,"It's a lot to do with the communities of both animal crossing and doom being chill people who are happy for each other.

ac_newhorizons,fint9t2,t1_fin3fon,1582569717.0,"We wont know how new horizons will work but for new leaf (and earlier), the game can only process one move in or out at a time. So if you want to take a break, you wait for a villager to ask to move and you say yes or no. Then you save and quit. When you boot it up next, that village's request will resolve based on your answer.

Hopefully new horizons has a ""vacation mode"" or something to freeze the happenings of the island."
news,fias4ol,t1_fianro9,1582307324.0,"I think they meant because jacksonville, Florida expanded the city size to be the entire county. It's the 5th largest in that respect and the largest on the continental us. Alaska cities beat it out (according to wikipedia, that is)."
NintendoSwitch,fi9kix7,t1_fi9im5h,1582269389.0,"I think they meant like how snooty, normal, uchi, and peppy are female villager only and lazy, smug, jock, and cranky are male only."
ac_newhorizons,fi9h986,t1_fi9enyc,1582265822.0,"por que no los dos?

The pink and blue blend to make the purple of the bi flag but her white face and ears distinguish the two original colors (pink and blue) like the trans flag."
ac_newhorizons,fi89a2h,t3_f6v9wz,1582235837.0,"My 3 mandatories are kiki, kidd and rasher. I think I need to add blue goat to my list and maybe sassy glasses cat....also maybe side eye elephant."
ac_newhorizons,fi89448,t1_fi7738d,1582235749.0,Shes conveniently also bi-colored. As in the flag.
