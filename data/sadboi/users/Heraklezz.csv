Turns out that what I had read/heard was, because of the construction method used on cars (especially newer cars) they are not a faraday cage.

Right now I’m about to spend my very last money on bills and I have no new job as of yet. I am very lucky though, because I still live with my parents and they have told me that they will pay my bills when I’m out of money. Though I need to pay it back when I get a new source of income.

Rainbow6,f4yofb3,t1_f4ymi25,1571881302.0,"I think you misunderstood what I meant, or well I didn’t really phrase it correct (my apologies for that). 

It’s not whether other people like the skins or not, but the feeling of having something many others doesn’t have. At least that’s what’s in it for me to get skins, to be able to say proudly “I had to grind >this< to get it” or “I played during that time/era when it was available” or something along those lines. 

Kind of the difference between having a common and legendary skin (besides the look), do you get me? So it’s not that I care about what others think, but the feeling of having something rare.

I’m sorry but I don’t think I mentioned anything about skins from the shop? I was talking about the limited time skins from previous events. I just recently started so this is my first event, and if the skin you’re talking about was from the shop I apologize.

Edit: English isn’t my primary language so I do apologize for any misunderstanding or if I phrase myself bad enough to not get my point across. I mean in no way to disrespect you"
Rainbow6,f4yli0v,t1_f4wa8ln,1571879291.0,"Yeah nah I don’t think so and I hope they won’t. I can see from a business perspective that it would generate money, but other than that it would be stupid.

It would completely ruin the whole concept of having skins, especially event based skins. You want people to be amazed by your skins, to be proud by having that rare skin. If everyone have(or has??) it, it wouldn’t be any special and it wouldn’t be any different from having the default set."

My point was more that what I have been told by professionals (doctors/psychiatrist/psychologist etc), is that the right combination (Not meaning there is A right one, but right for the individual) of medication and counseling is the most effective way.

Anxiety,ew0q5wn,t3_cm556z,1565001530.0,"Oh yes, every single day of the week. I can relate too a 100%. I work full time, and I absolutely dread about going to work the next all day, every day.

Usually I stay awake way too long and only get 1-2 hours of sleep, if any at all. Both the lack of sleep and my thoughts about the work is killing me, it’s making me crazy. 

I used to love too sleep, but now I can’t bare myself to even take a little nap on the afternoon. I simply don’t want to loose any hours from the time I don’t have to work, and I don’t want it to be closer to time for work.

I should be at work right now, but after laying awake all night and having terrible thoughts I couldn’t take my ass to work so I stayed home. That in itself causes anxiety as well because I’m skipping out of work and gets afraid they’ll be mad and disappointed at me.

It’s a viscous cycle and I have no clue how to break out of it. Feels like whatever decision I make, it will cause more anxiety than what I had before."
