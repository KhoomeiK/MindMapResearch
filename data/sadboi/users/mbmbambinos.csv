If you are on your mom's insurance, you'll need to tell her that you're struggling, but if you don't currently see a counselor I encourage you to do so. If you are ever in crisis, please reach out to a hotline. The Crisis Text Line is available at 741741, and there is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and a sexual assault hotline as well. I've contacted all many times and have found them extremely helpful."

If you feel that there is nobody you know who you feel comfortable talking to, a crisis line is a good idea! You can talk to someone who you don't know and is empathetic. I don't want to pry, but if you aren't able to go to therapy for quarantine related reasons, could you contact your therapist? You could try setting up an video session. I've found that virtual therapy is still quite helpful for me."
SuicideWatch,fordua6,t3_g947mb,1588010539.0,"It is not stupid to feel suicidal. Your feelings are valid. This pandemic is weighing heavily on many people, and is something you should speak to your therapist about if you are still seeing them. If you are unable, I would recommend talking to a crisis line or hotline. With regards to your job, I think you should talk to your boss about how overwhelmed you're feeling if you get along well. If you miss the company of your coworkers, try to set up a call with them outside of work time! It could be a video call or just voice call, anything to hear their voices and chat for a little while! Hope you're doing okay <3"

We already know that they are concerned about you, and I think the best thing you can do to relieve that is to seek help. You could even ask your parents to help you bring it up to your counselor, because she can probably hook you up with a specialist. Alternatively, you could switch counselors and see another professional who will not dismiss what you tell them."
SuicideWatch,fohtcsh,t3_g7jbxt,1587772260.0,"It sounds like you may have body dysmorphia. I would see a psychiatrist or other professional about it, maybe a nutritionist? It's good that your family is trying to look out for your health, but I understand the frustration that comes with it. First, I recommend seeing if your weight is healthy or overweight. If it is unhealthy, you should talk to your parents and explain that you are trying to live a healthy lifestyle, and that they shouldn't worry about you. If your weight is healthy, I think you should talk to someone about your body image. It is a huge struggle, but it's really important to have a healthy view of yourself. Hope you're doing okay <3"

I think in some places, HRT or any gender affirming treatments aren't legally allowed until the person is sixteen, so that may be why you aren't being helped immediately. You are still totally male, doctors just aren't allowed to do anything about that yet. Still, you should talk to a parent about it. They most likely will want to support you and help you.

It may feel like therapists and other professionals are interrogating you, but they are trying to get a better understanding of your situation and feelings. They need to know more about your experience in order to best help you.

It is hard to resist the urges to hurt yourself. I hope you are staying safe right now. <3"

It may seem like you're snitching on her or being a bad partner, but the best thing for her to do is get help. She will probably be angry at you if you do report her, but it's important for her to get help before her addiction gets too bad or her mental health gets worse. If you don't want to do that, the best thing to do is make sure that she knows you care about her and are there to support her.

I just got a C in my math class because I forgot to turn in a project online after school was closed. I do not want to invalidate your feelings, so I hope it doesn't come across this way, but it may be helpful to try to reframe your thoughts. Everyone feels lazy sometimes, but it often makes us feel worse if we assign that adjective to our personality instead of our current mood or behavior. I'm not sure if it will be helpful, but in the future, maybe try saying ""I have no motivation"" or ""I'm feeling lazy"" rather than ""I feel lazy."" Calling yourself that negative adjective makes it seem like there's no way it'll ever be any other way."

I know it is hard, but I am proud of you and I encourage you to seek help again."
