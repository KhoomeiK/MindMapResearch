LoveTV,esry5ag,t1_esrwffg,1562240239.0,"She was going through changes though. Just because she didn’t have a successful personality improvement, doesn’t mean lazy writing. 

I agree that it could’ve been different or improved, of course, anything could. 

But it does show the way she handled different situations, the craziness at the party in the pool, all the shit with Dustin, when Gus went away, her trying to push Gus and Bertie together then involving herself as a third wheel. They all show BPD and that’s the thing, BPD doesn’t improve at the end of a 3 season show. I don’t think they intended it to end there, didn’t it get cancelled? (Sadly). But, it shows a cycle of her attempting to fix her shit (taking the woman’s number from AA, rearranging her living room instead of drinking, trying to distract the conversation at the dinner party instead of flipping out), but then shows the inevitable regression to usual behaviour because things haven’t worked out. 

I think the only way her symptoms (and therefore life) would realistically improve is if they put her in therapy. Worked for me, and to be truthful I can’t see how I would’ve changed otherwise. She’s trying all these short term things but can’t stick to them as they don’t work right away. 


I see the cycle, she didn’t  have a personality change like Gus and Bertie (Randy remained a bit of a loser?) but, I think there’s hidden depths in the writing of Mickeys character"
LoveTV,espsv0o,t3_c8rycl,1562189477.0,"I strongly believe ( and have confirmation from the guy who plays Chris) that Mickey’s character was designed to portray her as suffering frim Borderline Personality Disorder. All of her actions and reactions tick the boxes. 

I think this was a show created to display the intricacies and the detail behind mental struggles and illnesses. Bertie, Randy and Gus all display characteristics of things you see in common mental health issues (haven’t watched recently enough to give examples but there have been threads on this sub before). 

Anyway - so Mickey definitely has BPD. I don’t necessarily think you’re always supposed to like the main character. I think it was more a raw and honest depiction of how her struggle comes across. 

Anyone with BPD ( 🙋‍♀️) will probably agree, it’s so deep and relatable it hurts, I had to watch like 3 times and probably gonna rewatch again. I think people can have strong views on mickey because she did the controversial shit that people do in their day to day lives. Lie, cheat, manipulate, get drunk, mess up apologise and mess up again. The things we (general public) dislike her for are the things we dislike in ourselves. 

It’s not like you can strictly say she’s a bad person because she genuinely tries to be better. When Gus went on the trip and she said she doesn’t do well with separation, but then throws herself into her work and is doing really well in other areas (total BPD thing), she was trying and proving that she can handle it and be successful, she just couldn’t be her own person with Gus around. They were both so codependent 

I loved the show and I’m gutted it got cancelled, felt such a deep connection like I was one of them. But that’s probably the BPD all stirred up inside me. 

Feel free to dislike her for her actions but I’m almost certain she was designed to portray Borderline, without giving an official diagnosis. Didn’t taint the show with the stigma and she probably ended up with more sympathy and understanding than if they had made it exclusive with a diagnosis."

The myth with therapy is, that because you turn up somewhere with a professional in the room they do a bippity boppity boop and you’re all better. Nope. You have to put the work in. You make all the changes. They just facilitate it to make sure you’re on the right track. 

People always talk about DBT for BPD. But the country I’m in, there’s a specific service just for BPD and they do mentalisation based therapy. Worked a treat for me. Mixture of group and individual therapy. And I think with BPD we benefit from group therapy more as it allows you to all discover different perspectives on everything. 

Best of luck my friend. Try not to give up. I celebrate every birthday a little bit more now because I never expected to reach my 18th, and I’m almost a decade on now. 

BPD isn’t terminal - it’s partially genetic but triggers and stuff are a lot to do with environment, learned associations, upbringing etc. that can be retrained. 

If a healthy person can be beaten down and brain washed by an abusive partner in their adult years why can’t we do the reverse? Rhetorical question - we can! 💖"

Also... for eggs to run out as a woman gets older ( or premature menopause) does this happen because someone was born with much fewer eggs? 
Or do more eggs develop during life? Or is there just one supply and when it runs out thats it?"
