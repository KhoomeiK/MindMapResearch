The problem further compounded once I hit puberty. I became very attention seeking; sexually. When I met my wife, I was still talking to 12 different women. She found out as you did and dealt with it for a short amount of time.

I desired the purposeful attention  as much as the random acts. There was just something about my mentality of desiring intimate attention, sexual or not.

What it came down to was when my wife and I had one final conversation. “Cut every other interesting woman out of your life, or we’re done.”

Three years later, I can say that I’m happily married, with a newborn, and another on its way. At times I absolutely struggle with desiring other women’s attention. But when I feel those urges, I communicate that to my wife, and we take care of it.

Both options are good. You can leave and find someone who you’re absolutely infatuated with. Or you could do your absolute best to keep everything together. But please remember, if you choose this option. You’ll forever be fighting other women’s attention.

On the flip side, I’m 27 myself. I believe myself to be decent at guesstimating ages. It’s completely possible he knew you were young, but asked your age to make sure that you weren’t a minor. I personally can’t think of a reason why I would ask a young woman for her phone number, unless he was just as surprised as you were about the age gap.

My advice: 

Be very careful. If he starts pushing to hang out, block his number. Feel out the situation. Sometimes age is just a number. You should test the situation by walking your dog in another neighborhood. Go out of your way to bring your dog to a nice, new place for a week or two. Your Puppers will enjoy it, and it will give you a controlled situation to judge his character!

That’s what I want my community to feel like. Two people, an audience, and a future revisit.

Ive browsed plenty of other subreddits, none of them revisit the person."
relationship_advice,fm8p3bm,t3_ftrx0g,1585853407.0,"My wife and I went through the exact same thing when we first dated. I was friends with all my ex’s. But all those relationships were sexual.

She was insecure, but at the end of our conversation. We both agreed that any and all ties to previous relationships need to be cut. It’s a respect for your significant other type of situation.  She made a good point: 

“ even if you dated another woman for 1 day. I would rather you not talk to them because I don’t want you to dwell in the past, with past experiences. I want you to look forward to future memories with me by your side.”

Hope this helps!
With you luck."

BUT! My parents absolutely drilled, nearly brainwashed me into saying “thank you” and “ you’re welcome” for everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. If I didn’t give thanks, I was told that I was ,undeserving, unworthy, and insensitive to others care for me. It honestly manifested into anxiety later in life. Perhaps this is the same situation?"
relationship_advice,fm72yr6,t3_fthmhx,1585811356.0,"If my wife ever stopped communication for more than 12’hours. I’m calling her work, my brother-in-law, and my Father-in-law. Then the police.

My situation is a bit different because we’re married. But back when we were dating, there were only a very select few times where we went a full 24 hours without communication.

If you’re fighting with him as much as you say you are. It’s time to consider a different relationship. Communication is key to any relationship. It’s one of the largest foundations to a marriage as well."

It’s Not covered by any insurance companies, but if it’s affecting your mental health this bad. It’s justified. There’s not reason to end your life over a weird looking penis.

Be warned, there no greater, longer lasting pain of a circumcision. The first 2 weeks were very uncomfortable for my new born son."

I’m truly sorry that you had to go through this. I know how literal your heart hurts."
