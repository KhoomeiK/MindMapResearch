BPD,fqgb50s,t1_fqg8v0w,1589341953.0,"I think for a lot of us, we are the most abusive to ourselves.

So when people point out our abusiveness to others, we dismiss it, because - hey, in comparison to what WE put up with, its nothing.

But really, we should be treating ourselves better too. We're actually worth it.

(not that we shouldn't be better towards others as well - 100% agree with OP's point)"
SuicideWatch,fqeck3w,t3_giemq7,1589305325.0,"I'm a veteran and have been voluntarily hospitalized but that was before my military experience. 

You seem to have a pretty good grip on where you are and what you need. You should look for a therapist or hospital now. It sounds like you need additional help in some form. Maybe new medication, or a different dose? Maybe therapy on a regular level, CBT and learning some skills?

I was really young and the in patient experience was scary, but I wasn't on medication. Most of the people in the hospital were there because they were having their meds adjusted and their doctors wanted them supervised while that happened."

which for PC, means steam  
where else would they release?  
and should they NOT be available on PC? people use bluestacks, why not just be available on steam? I think they just need a F2P tag, or in app purchases or something, so people know its payment model"

dbtselfhelp,fpkm2ef,t3_gdnx54,1588697088.0,"I find observing my pets is a really good way for me to practice this skill.

I tend to treat my pets like people, and so when I see them doing things, I think its because they're feeling things or wanting things much more complex than possible - my dog sighed. Normally I'd think - my dog sighed, she must be bored, maybe I should play with her.  


So to observe with the pets worked well for me. It made me pay attention to the normal flow of thoughts that I attach to observe - and then how to attempt to stop it."
BPD,fn8tdmo,t3_fzzk3m,1586749743.0,"radical acceptance is really hard for me. I'm in a weekly DBT group now and it has been suggested I use radical acceptance for dealing with the death of my mother. She died when i was 20 (almost 20 years ago)

Another therapist has diagnosed me with prolonged grief disorder  (which didn't exist 20 years ago)

the statement  I came up with to radically accept was - my life is worth living without my mom.

I just don't know if **I believe it**"

CasualConversation,ezutiq1,t3_d2avxm,1568160545.0,"I would 100% recommend therapy. Before even your PCP.  I had my first panic attack about a month ago, and I'm almost 40. I was in an elevator with someone and they triggered some PTSD sexual assault stuff that caused my panic attack. 

Mantra's worked well for me when I felt close to being triggered again - mostly the line from the movie Labrynth ""You have no power over me"""

wls,eu3jcv1,t1_eu3ebf5,1563416255.0,"Why is a number your goal?

Especially if you're 13 pounds away from it - what's going to magically change in 13 pounds?

Imho, the goal is to be healthy, and learn to have a positive, sustainable relationship with food so we can stay at a healthy weight. If you are getting medical advice to eat more and that means hitting a number at a later date, shouldn't that be the priority?  


What kind of surgery did you have? I've found if I eat the right types of foods (protein, fruit, veggies) and eat slowly, I can pretty much eat whenever I'm hungry. I'm strict about what I can and can't eat, but not about when or how much. I eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full."
