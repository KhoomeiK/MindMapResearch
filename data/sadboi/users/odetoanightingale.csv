My favourite tip she gave me was the get a sheet of paper and break down what you have to do in reallyyy tiny steps. Some of the steps might seem obvious to others, but it really helps to see everything laid out. It‚Äôs hard to initially force yourself to make that list of steps you need to take to get your work done, but once you cross one or two things off the list, it becomes a lot easier! At least this is the case for me. 

This doesn‚Äôt get rid of a lack of motivation really, but it has helped me a ton with getting work done without feeling overwhelmed by a looming word count, which can make me panic a lot. Instead, I focus on smaller things, and these bite-sized amounts of work are easier on my brain.

callmebyyourname,fn7hpni,t3_fzz3b3,1586720552.0,"I recommend reading the book, and/or watching the movie from Oliver‚Äôs perspective! The book makes it clear that Elio and Oliver are both bi. 

My take on Oliver‚Äôs actions is that, as he says in the movie, he was afraid to make a move on Elio because he felt like he would corrupt him. I think this is due to internalised homophobia, which is pretty common for LGBTQ+ people to experience if they grew up in and intolerant society. It basically means that Oliver felt like he was doing something wrong or would he harming Elio by being with him. So he feels a lot of shame about his sexuality, and doesn‚Äôt want Elio to go through the stigma he had faced. Because in the 80s, being gay had SO MUCH stigma that, if their sexuality was made public, they could lose jobs, etc. 

So I suggest watching the movie from Oliver‚Äôs perspective, especially keeping in mind that he is probably experiencing a lot of shame and internalised homophobia about his feelings. As for them both being bi, the book clears this up really well. 

This is just my take on it all, I could very well be wrong."

TrueAtheism,fks79ui,t3_fkbgz1,1584483782.0,"Yes I relate to this 100%!!

I was raised in the Vineyard church, so was always around so-named ""spiritual experiences"" (speaking in tongues, family members claiming to see ghosts, angels and demons at war with one another, etc.). I never really felt a connection to the whole god thing, but decided to give Wicca and then eclectic paganism a try, because I still felt some sort of emotional connection to nature, and assumed it had to be supernatural. I think it felt like a good transition at the time, since I felt a lot of guilt for not believing (my dad is a pastor lol, so that didn't help the guilt!). I wanted so badly to believe in *something.* I felt like my life wouldn't have meaning without some spiritual aspect, since that was what I'd been taught my whole life. 

My pagan phase was pretty brief. About a year altogether, but I never really believed it, and it was mostly forced. I actually find it really helped me in my transition to humanist and atheist. It also really influenced my personal style. Catch me looking like Stevie Nicks 6 days out of 10. 

I still hold some of the Wiccan values. Specifically the ones related to protecting nature, and that humans shouldn't be valued above all other living creatures. Oh yeah, and I still drink a shit ton of tea. I just don't believe the herbs in my garden are magical anymore lol. 

TLDR: grew up in a VERY spiritual church (ghosts, tongues, angel and demon wars), turned to Wicca, then to eclectic paganism, now I'd identify as humanist atheist!"

They used to make me go to church too, but I decided to get a job and request to work on Sunday (you could do the same for whatever time your church service is at). Or you could join a club through school that meets at that time if it's an option. That way you have a legitimate reason to skip on church. (That is if you have time for a job!) If your parents are anything like mine, they'll be thrilled that you're getting involved or making money.

Otherwise, I know it's really hard, but until you've moved out your parents will probably keep making you go to church. Until you get those blissful Sundays of sleeping in, I'd suggest using church as a way to better understand Christians.

caffeine,fe5w09t,t3_enr20r,1578876194.0,"I haven't tried caffeine pills before, but I am an avid coffee and tea drinker. I've also tried green tea pills and find them highly effective for what I'm looking for. 

The main difference in green tea vs. caffeine in general is that green tea contains an amino acid called L-Theanine. While both contain caffeine, and will be stimulating to some degree, L-Theanine provides calming effects as well. L-Theanine has been found to boost your mood and has relaxing properties (these results were found in smaller studies, bear in mind!). 

So the main difference between straight-up caffeine pills and green tea pills will be the L-Theanine. Both will be stimulating, but while lots of caffeine can give you a racing heart or anxious feelings (in my experience), the L-Theanine will counteract that a bit. You'll still get that caffeinated ""awake"" feeling, but without some of the negative side effects (if you find that to be an issue). 

Sometimes I take green tea pills for that boost of energy without the anxiety-provoking symptoms caffeine sometimes gives me. Hopefully this was somewhat useful! :)

TLDR: main difference between caffeine pills and green tea pills is L-Theanine, which can help you feel calm while also feeling more awake."

UofT,fdcjntb,t3_ekmda9,1578276559.0,"I'm not a professional and this is all based on personal experience, but here is what I did to get help.

In my experience, the easiest thing is to first go to your family doctor. If you don't have a family doctor, schedule an appointment at a clinic (uni clinics can be long waits, so try a Loblaws or somewhere else. They usually have quick service and are funded by OHIP if you have it.).

Make the appointment on the basis of ""mental health"" or ""depression"" or whatever your mental health problem is. Once you're at the doctor's, they can either prescribe you with antidepressants in some cases, or they might refer you to a psychiatrist. Most people I know found a psychiatrist this way. Going through a family doctor is a much quicker route than looking on your own for a psychiatrist, and then having to be on a waitlist. Doctors tend to have an easier time getting you an appointment, in my experience!

The doctor can prescribe you meds if needed/if that's a route you're comfortable with, refer you to a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis and to specialise your meds more to your specific needs. Doctors can also recommend therapists and even refer you to one if that's something you're interested in. Personally, my doctor referred me to a psychiatrist to tweak the medications, AND referred me to a therapist to best fit my needs.

As for if your mental health cannot be diagnosed, I would say therapy is a great option if you have coverage. I think everyone can benefit from therapy, whether or not they have been properly diagnosed. Therapy will help you have coping techniques for stress or whatever other problems you regularly deal with, so it's certainly a wonderful option if you can afford it.

I know it's so hard recognising that your mental health isn't doing well, and that it's an even harder step to actually put steps forward to ask for help. I'm so happy you've reached the place where you're seeking help.

Hopefully this helps, and let me know if you have questions (all I know is my experience and friends' experiences, but I'll do my best!). Best of luck getting the help you deserve!

Personally, I have only been attracted to men and women, which is why I use bi over pan. I ABSOLUTELY would date a trans man or woman, as they are still a man or woman. 

I have personally never had romantic or sexual attraction for a person who identifies as neither male or female, which is why I use the label bisexual. That said, I do know bi people who are only attracted to feminine presenting people (e.g. feminine women and nb people who present themselves as traditionally ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù), and people who use the label differently. 

As a bi woman, I have equal attraction to men and women, regardless of whether they‚Äôre trans or cis. I also recognise that being bi could have connotations with being transphobic or anti-nb. But since I have yet to experience attraction towards an nb person, this is why I identify as bi. 

I know some bi people who wouldn‚Äôt date trans people, some who would date nb people, and people like me who are attracted to two or more genders and like the term bi the best.

UofT is definitely harder than other universities, but not to the extent people on here would have you believe.

At UofT, I work my ass off and get B's and some A's.

That being said, while UofT is certainly difficult, don't be discouraged by some of the things people say about why you shouldn't come here. You WILL have to work hard to get good grades. But all universities require lots of work to get good grades.

It also varies based on faculty. I get pretty good marks, but I'm in social sciences, so take my response with a grain of salt. Obviously Eng would be much more rigorous, and it has a reputation of being hard for a reason.

Recently came to my attention that an old favourite instagram account of mine (who I've very quickly unfollowed) posts some very misinformed information on her blog, as well as some horribly problematic Christian ideas. Her instagram is @girlincalico and she has a [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC35qO14H6a85IunA8V0-xow) too. On her socials she comes across as a lovely channel on living sustainably. Her dangerous ideas come into play on her [blog](https://www.calicoandtwine.com/blog).

In one [post](https://www.calicoandtwine.com/blog/why-i-dont-celebrate-halloween) she talks about Halloween, and why it's an evil, etc. But I think the danger comes when she discusses GMOs, candy, artificial flavours, etc. She says GMOs are ""shown to increase tumor growth"" and that artificial flavours lead to ""major health problems such as tumors, cancer, brain damage, seizures."" 

In another [post](https://www.calicoandtwine.com/blog/on-standing-up-and-speaking-out-as-a-christian) she rants about ""The war on Christianity."" . . . some quotes for some grim entertainment:

""Was engaging in ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù as a Christian as important a couple hundred years ago as it is now? I would say no. Why? Because 200 and even 100 years ago our government still recognized the fact that America‚Äôs foundation was built on the Bible and God‚Äôs truth. Politics and society were simply just generally aligned with biblical principles. Now? Not so much."" 

""**We** ***need*** **to be tackling cultural issues like abortion, feminism, sexuality, marriage, family values, etc from a Biblical perspective.""**

A [post](https://www.calicoandtwine.com/blog/compassionate-living) on veganism where she discusses how vegans have ""silence on issues like vaccines (which contain abused animal DNA) and abortion (also an industry that takes lives from the innocent and voiceless) is hypocritical and makes it very clear that their agenda has only one intention and that is to further the radical left."" Yikes.

She also did an insta story about some sketchy climate change opinions that is since deleted.
