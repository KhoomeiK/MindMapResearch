You are very correct.  It is worth it and sometimes it is very, very difficult to make friends and find our way back from the corner we've painted ourselves into, mentally. It is most difficult to overcome self-loathing.  Developing grit as a skill (still working on it, myself) seems to be very important in synthesizing the determination to struggle through.  Struggle makes grit.  Grit helps struggle.  Feeling like anything more than a failed mechanism because of the tendency towards screwing up is also tied in this positive feedback loop.

Whatever your experience, keep that stuff up!  :D"

I have so much further to go, still, but I've slowed down on my impulsive eating quite a bit.  I still blow it here and there, but it's OK now that I've reduced the frequency so much.

There is a big problem.  He has a ton of growing to do and needs to begin ASAP, starting with owning his issues.  Mine fall under emotional sensitivity and Executive Function issues via ADHD-like symptoms. 

If he doesn't agree to go all-in with getting help, then you should separate immediately for the kids' safety.  I wish we had.  My kids suffered an unaware Dad with his emotional issues for a majority of their young life.

I wish I had gotten the intervention early.  It would have sucked for me and been heart-breaking, but at least it would have been just me suffering and not my kids.

She eventually divorced me, which is the best thing for us all.  It moved us into healing space for us all, and in thankful for it.   My love was real, so was my lack of self control.  Nobody on the outside would have guessed I had the problem.  I didn't mean it, but did not know I needed help.

He sounds just like me.  The pets paid a price, just like yours.  The shame is debilitating.  I fkr understand how dangerous I was. 

I'm happy to answer questions if you like.  The problem is real.  Take no chances.  I can't change my past.  I'm sorry about that.  The kids turned out wonderful in spite of my lack and error, for which I am eternally grateful.  His love for you and the baby is most likely real, I believe, as mine was.  His ability to manage the emotions still sounds on-par with mine at that time, as well.  This is potentially dangerous. Babies are harder to tolerate than dogs, from my own experience.  Sleep deprivation amplifies impatience immensely. 

The path to hell is paved with the best of intentions, as the saying goes.  Mine was. 

Get help!  There is hope if you both begin, for real, right away. 

Message me if you want further discussion.

Be wise.  This is your wake-up call.... So very much like mine was.  Make good choices.  Give him a fish chance to prove himself and hold him to it.  He has violated very sacred space already by injuring your fur baby.  You both need help in the worst way."
adhd_anxiety,fouv4nc,t3_g8728k,1588090912.0,"One more 'short' (ha!) thought on being myself that may help others out...  I have recently realized that I have a tendency to be waaaaayyyyy too serious about so many things without intending OR REALIZING it.  R.S.D. (Rejection-Sensitive Dysphoria) helps me to stay uptight by trying to be too perfect, too accurate, all the time; learning to relax is another long-haul project I am involved in.  Being way too serious is a definite downside to ""being myself"" and is definitely a slippery slope.  I don't remember to check in or monitor myself.  :/  It definitely is a function of quality rest, inversely manifesting.  Less rested me = more serious about stoopid things. 

With other things I have been able to use paper charts to track progress to comply to using ""S.M.A.R.T.""  goals for gaining achievements.  ( SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely).  ( https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/smart-goal/ ).

Important things in my life rate using good processes to ensure they happen.  It's too bad that I have to set up scaffolding to make myself track these things.  Regular consistency is a huge issue for me in most things.  We do what we have to in order to function better, though, if we really want the change. I'm thinking of also using this tool to create bio-feedback about this problem for myself and thought that ""being too serious"" as a default mode was good to mention here, too.  That part of myself is unhealthy for all involved, unfortunately, and shame-inspiring too... about as much fun to deal with as a tickling sensation in a nostril! 

What are your experiences in dealing with this aspect of ADHD or anxiety?  I could use some help with improving.  + Thanks!

Recovery time is reduced from days to a much smaller frame, now.  I do not miss the shameful state.  It was my mental outfit for much of my younger years.  I had no clue that it was even happening , but accepted it as being normal. Nobody else in my family knew that it was happening, either.  That was the actual shameful situation...  that nobody even knew I was suffering the anguish of zero self-valuation. I think it is very difficult to detect, though.

I get the mental zoomies / enthusiasm still.

""Squirrel!""  :)  Learning to enjoy who I am, troublesome ADHD-like quirks included, is the point of transitioning from a sense of failure to one of having found a foundation for success.

adhd_anxiety,fonm9l8,t1_foncjfo,1587922205.0,"First impressions...  wow, so true for me, too.  When young I was too ignorant of what my impression was.  I had no filters on my character.  Now I am learning to remove them, judiciously. The filters aren't completely useless.  :) I have come to a point if awareness of being not genuine to shape what others thought of me as a coping mechanism.  It's OK, almost, but traps me instead, I have found.  Removing that mechanism and working from within my much more vulnerable real character has brought much fresh air!  This has led me to, somehow, accidentally begin exploring why I behave the way I do. I have found this, ultimately:  I have ADHD-like symptoms. 

Sleep apnea can causes ADHD-like symptoms.  So can past trauma... emotional or physical.  So can real ADHD.  It is internally vicious.  I am undiagnosed and won't be for some time, probably.  I am not sure where in time my anxiety began, but I now see how I thought my anxiety was my character during my prior life, and from a very young age!  I have believed my own idea of being a stupid failure for many years.

I have learned that we can gaslight ourselves into a devalued state of our own worth.  We can hardly explain to others why we are troubled without triggering another cascade of spiraling self-shame, sadness, worthlessness, anxiety, neurotic self-deprecatng unforgiving perfectionism, and on and on.  It's a very real, toxic feedback loop.  It can spoil our will and bring us into a place where we give up on trying to retain our own wholesome natures, turning to ""getting what I deserve,"" instead, self-nurture and the nurturing of others.  Be curious and act with courage on your behalf to preserve yourself.  Seek whatever help you can bear asking for.  Even responding here has me facing down more of this same internal noise and daily self-doubt in myself.  My skill in putting it down grows with each round faced, though.  I want to encourage others Into finding their way to their own calm, vital space of growth or regrowth. Avoiding the learned shying-away-from-fear safety habit has been key to my own successful pivot.  I never believed that my busy, distractable, quick and very emotional mind could be anything other than derailed.  Mindfulness about myself is the port I use to change daily.  Non-reactive mindfulness and finding ways to like myself instead of trying to cajole others to approve of me has become my nutrition.  I'm still a mess, I believe, but if the solidity and traction I'm experiencing now is found in this initial, messy version of myself, I can hardly wait to see what more I can become if I continue to press onwards.  I am no longer fueling the tortured, emotional tornado I had become so naturalized to.  I am actively changing and breathe in a more relaxed way regularly now, daily.

I realize I am responsible for the energy I bring into this and any room.  I am responsible for the management and ownership of my recognized ADHD-like symptoms, whatever their cause.  I am responsible to be compassionate to myself as I learn and grow my understanding of my own self.  I am responsible to nurture my growth and for the ongoing vigilance for and correction of my own decay.

This is the way I am rescuing myself from all the learned helplessness I have accrued. I am trying to practice my way out of building text walls, like this one...  That may take the rest of my lifetime, though.  Heh heh!  I can win the other chosen battles, but this one... oy!  ;)

Please message me if you want to explore mutual support for any common struggles.  I would be happy to, as time permits.

Pressing through the fear as best as possible helps me, bringing confidence in little pieces.  Getting behind on a lifetimes' progress feels worse to me than the fears that cowed me to begin with. When fear is in charge, I am not.  Calmly face it down and keep your boundaries to preserve yourself.  It's not a clean-cut business.  Mistakes will be made.  Be kind to all involved, especially yourself.  It may overwhelm you.  That's OK.  Learn how to recover well each time and keep trying.  You have worth."
adhd_anxiety,fomhauj,t3_g8728k,1587889997.0,"My good fellow, it sucks to be afraid of failure to this degree.  I'm 51 and struggle to relax my perfectionism about ensuring that I am liked by all.  To follow through makes me into a disingenuinuous individual and robs all involved from their fair chance to know and respond to my real character, including myself.  Of course, be wise about when and where to let your particular flags fly...  not every person has a kind heart and may not treat you fairly.  Do press into allowing yourself to show, though, when it seems right.  To reach the far end of your life and to have always disguised yourself will leave you lacking in self-respect, I believe.  You will also stunt your own growth potential...  which is equivalent to benching a good player for the season.  This is embarassing to explain to others.  It takes wading through our fear often until it doesn't sting as much and our wincing reduces.  Keep asking good questions; it will help you to be curious and find more like-minded, authentic souls to journey with.  I am having success in  braving my daily fears, bit by bit, and finding out how much I have missed by hiding myself in the shadows of my pet worry.  Stay safe, however, live your life and be kind to others and especially yourself. I know how many were cheated, including my kids, out of having full access to a mature and present me in all of my past.  You will be hurt just as badly even if you stay hidden...the pain finds us anyways.  May as well have some say in who you are when it finds you.  A few years of release practice has yielded a much more satisfying existence.  I look forward to the results of continuing.  I hope this is encouraging for you.  Living is not easy, but we don't have to make it any harder than it is...  and we can make it to be a lot more fun, too!  Take wise courage and calculated risks.  It will be scary.  It's worth pushing through it.  Find out before you age any further!  Have a great day!  :)"

I am satisfied with all the answers I have read so far...  AND!...  yet, I am still unsatiated about another part... why are there different altitudes that clouds begin formation at in the same air-space?  Why are some starting at 9,000 feet and some forming only at a much, much higher level in the atmosphere?  Some layers are obviously ice-crystal-based layers lightly obscuring day or moon light, some are ""wet"" clouds but not the top of a connected, rising column.  Why, oh, why do they (the ""wet"" clouds) all not simply form at one given altitude based on the particular atmospheric physics present for that day or night?  Why are there multiple ""starting altitudes"" present in the same local body of air instead of a uniform starting altitude for all clouds in that same area?  This is so complicated a subject that it seems impossible to explain the processes to five-year-olds.

I may have already answered my own question by the fact that it is just a complex bunch of physics and chemistry at play and it happens, ""just because,"" which is a truly appropriate explanation for a five-year old on this subject.  :) I hope there is an understandable answer, though.  Thank you to all who have replied to inform the rest of us!  I have read all the responses that I have found here."

We are a resourceful and sneaky lot, we with brains.

Keep figuring your puzzle out.  You can do this."
Anxiety,fm1a7ev,t3_fsa1lu,1585674775.0,"OP - THANK YOU.  This resonates with my experience.  Sometimes we (myself, 50, male) go through our lives and manage to avoid this realization and all the symptoms pointing out that we are not owning our own locus of control, but have adopted a ""learned helplessness"" or, flipped, ""never have learned control"".  The same conclusion you have drawn is dawning (a process) in my life, drawn out by the severe nature of the pandemic, ultimately, after suspecting I might have adhd, which I began to notice 6 months ago.  Now I am not sure, but am addressing the symptoms to see if I can affect change in them.  If I can, then perhaps it's something else, but with the same nasty, life - restricting effects as adhd. Your post brings me warmth, as a validation, which is ironic.  A validation from someone who realizes they don't need validation except from oneself, the way I am also realizing this on my own, through my own struggles...  cool.  I'll take it!  :)  It's a good day! 

Keep struggling to grow yourself up. This is great! 

From the helpless state I had allowed myself to perform far, far below my potential for many years, creating many unnecessary circumstances and much depression, sadness, self-loathing, all served up with a smile the whole time, not knowing what was the core issue of it all.  Our children's exposure to my symptoms is a sadness in itself, but they have come through amazingly.  I am learning from them as they begin to fly more successfully than I have. 

One of the keys to my particular puzzle is this, though.  Now I am taking the protective stance over my own back, am responsible for the energy I bring into this room, and am in charge of who I surround myself with.  I feel I may be talking too much... unsure.  Nonetheless, I charge onward!  :) 

The pandemic and the isolation response as well as being laid off due to it have stripped all situations raw, to the bones, allowing for easier scrutiny of the hearts of my troubling matters.

It's a great time for self-examination, where possible, I believe.

Thank you for speaking up about this. It's been a big help to read, strengthening my understanding.

Congratulations on the realization.  So cool."

Each moment we are awake we are responsible for the energy we bring into a room.  Even on a bad day.  We may need to ask forgiveness if we are not as resilient as we normally can be, that's humanity in action.  WE FAIL.  But, we are responsible and need to own every bit of our energy we choose to share with others.  I'm an emotional sort; this has been a huge failing point for me, and for my kids, who got the brunt of an inexperienced, emotional adult.  I've stemmed my tide and am working with them to make it up.  My biggest breakthrough has come over years and days and months and weeks and didn't happen in one lump on any day but is the result of the progression.  It starts with owning our responsibilities, I believe.  ""I am responsible for the energy I bring into this room"" should be a sign on every doorway for myself.  Also, the anti-depressant has been a good help, too.  :-)  Sometimes it's just too much, though.  Sometimes we need help."
SuicideWatch,fknyh71,t3_fjg4r0,1584376506.0,"I'm a dramatic person, by wiring, so this makes sense.  We are too complex to be able to boil a motive down to simple levels like ""selfish"" without only using certain reasonings.  I cannot entertain it myself because I can't stand the sense of what things I would miss if I were to kill myself.  I think of it but never intend it.  My dramatic nature, when unchecked, gets me into such trouble. I have a lot of laughter and smiles to generate with people and a lot of help to give, yet, which makes for some great warmth inside for more than just myself.  I want to live to see those days.  I hope you do too.  Is it selfish? Maybe, but so is my root desire to persist for the good stuff, by the same reasoning.  I'm still learning about the ""What's in it for me"" line of decision-making.  It used to be the other person I valued, which made it terrible for myself, ultimately, and for others, as I burnt out.  The rest of my life is daily one-on-one therapy with myself, picking apart how to find the good amidst the shat.  The good stuff is very pleasant.  The tendencies of my wiring weighs heavily against my abilities, daily.  What a nuisance.  The electronics world made me into a button-press-get-reward kind of guy.  Damn!  That didn't help.  May you find dopamine-producing-activities to bring joy.  I hope you don't kill yourself but find a happier path while alive.  I don't know your situation, though.  I hope you choose to persist and look for the good amidst the shat, good that you can wash off and claim for yourself.  Not bad for a lifelong depressed guy who may have ADHD or Dysthymia or some such other mind-bender messing with my feeling and thinking world.  It makes so much more sense now that I understand my background characteristics.  Even with my dice weighted like this , there is still a lot of good potential.  I didn't always see it this way and am glad I stuck around long enough to see my troubles in abetter light.  I hope you get a chance to, also.

adhd_anxiety,fkav6et,t3_fha5om,1584020231.0,"Yeah, just figuring out at age 50 that I most likely have ADHD.  I have a lifetime of this sort of overconcern that I have needlessly put myself, and others through.  It's toxic and points to the defeated self esteem running the show.  It's taken many years of painful experiences to realize that I am the one messing things up by allowing myself to NOT release the worries my ""learned helplessness"" invokes.  Look that term up, please.  It sucks to own.  It pays off to address it, though.  Instead of obsessing over it, dial them up and check in about it.  ""Hey, when this happened did it make you feel such-and-such?""  or ""When that hapoened or was said it made me feel like this.  Now I don't know if I said or did something by mistake in return but wanted to check in with you about it and apologize if I screwed up.  I'm worried about having maybe messed up.""  

So much of my life is gone and filled with regrets that need not have been if I had learned to just check in about my worries.  The key is to learn and improve by changing my behavior in response to my over-strengthened anxieties.  It's a very real challenge to have a healthy esteem for myself when I have had a lifetime of failings without understanding why, like I do now.  Now I am learning about my developmental disability (ADHD /ADD) and am building scaffolding into my life to help me work through areas where I an weak.  I'm learning to not hate myself any more, but to understand the ""why"" and to avoid passive aggression to myself in the form of allowing myself to feel like a failure but instead giving myself permission to feel my fear and worry, to sort it out as best as possible in the moment by being non reactive and silent and thoughtful and choosing my responses...  It is not simple and takes mindful effort.  It is SO worth it.  I'm gaining self respect.   ADHD makes me tend to underthink ans underobserve in the moment because of my intense feelings and needing to alleviate them in that moment to feel better.  Many have suffered in my presence due to this impatience of mine.  This is a hard fact for me in my life, maybe not yours.  There is a sense of irony that I am feeling the urge to worry about if I'm responding incorrectly here, giving unwanted advice.  All I can do is to know that heeding THAT voice  / advisor has usually completely fouled up my behavior and to ignore ir, mostly, so that I can put together this response.  I'm so tired of my learned neurotucism and just want to live in peace in my head, finally.  I have been the worried, anxious sole author of my own pain for far too kong.  I do not want it any more and have the ability and power to change it.  And, :), In sorry if this is an uncomfortable or incorrect response.  :)  In worried that I might be making a mistake, but know my experiences are worth something.  Apologies if I'm coming across as narcissistic (my own vouce of worry chiming in) but want to share something that may help you with your potentially-unnecessary worrying and suffering, moving forward.  I abbhor my own ""neurotic"" feelings CD refuse to show mysekf to obsess in this way any further.  It brings mental dis-ease to free of the moment.  I hope this wall-of-text helps out.  :-)  Is OK to mess up...it's all practice. Good luck on your continued adventures in this experiment of living well.  :)"
