ptsd,fr2m3wi,t1_fr2lv93,1589839708.0,"yes its extremely effective in person, if you feel like you cant say certain things at the minute always feel free to tell him and you both can text what happened or how you feel. i really hope things go more your way and he understands good luck to you!!"
ptsd,fr2dwqr,t3_gm6h38,1589835612.0,"hey!! i know exactly how you feel, my and my boyfriend are coming up to our one year anniversary and i have turned him from never hugging anyone to being almost as clingy and affectionate as me but not quite... i always worry im being too much because its hard to retrain my self to not be like that. Does he know you‚Äôre a survivor of PTSD? because that generally helps your significant other understand. if not you should calmly explain yourself and maybe engage in some deep convo about yourself and have him talk about himself too? sorry if my english isnt great but please respond if you‚Äôd need me to repeat anything"

PTSDHumor,fqmxgsh,t1_fqmx8p4,1589485159.0,exactly! so many movies trigger me that have absolutely no clear correlation and all me and my boyfriend do is watch movies all day and its so difficult to say why i dont want to watch certain things. it feels so embarassing haha. i hope you‚Äôre coping well at the minute?
