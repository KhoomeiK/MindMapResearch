So compromise? they sleep in seperate rooms, they have to stay out of the bedroom till whenever. just make sure you stay on your sons side about this so he knows that he has someone other than his boyfriend on his side. and for your wife, a “bad feeling” about someone like that is basically saying “idk why i don’t like them” or “i don’t like them because of this __________ but i don’t want criticism form everyone for it”. talk to your wife and son, and have your son invite his bf over more so he can spend more time with your wife. my mom didn’t like my boyfriend until he spent more time with her, and she even let him spend the night. all of these people saying not to let those two spend the night, why not? his son could’ve never told them he was gay, and invited his boyfriend over. so, your arguments don’t really stand as to why this is such a big deal. and to the dad, good job for accepting your son and his boyfriend. we need more of that."

Also, kids are mean. i’m not saying your kid will do this, but his sex life would most likely be over before it’s even started. Well unless he finds a girl who’s okay with that, and most girls right now aren’t but maybe it will be more normal in the future. i think your dad is just trying to watch out for the kid, but there’s no reason for him not to talk too you. Also, if someone accidentally finds out about how your son is uncircumcised, it will be around the school almost instantly. he will be picked on for sure, and older kids will definitely pick on him more. just be ready for it all too happen"
