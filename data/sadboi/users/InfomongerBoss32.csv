It isn't the absence of your emotions, it's internally accepting & acknowledging your emotions & where socially & I interpersonally appropriate, showing them. But,  first you must acknowledge certain facts:   Feelings are neither good or bad, they simply are.  What ""makes them so"" is how you act - behavior, actions, words (or don't) about them. Your sense of value/validation must be founded on whether your feelings, behavior & actions validate your values - regardless of how others may judge them, dismiss them or ""use them against you."" You can't judge your ""insides"" (motives,  feelings, thinking) by other people's outsides. Genuinely, if you ""become cold & heartless"" are you not becoming like those you're lamenting against? 
Being kind, tender hearted, helpful, encouraging, caring are your right & choice,  but must be done for their own sake. Let the haters hate & you keep on being you.

A mental state brought on by exposure to physical abuse, emotional stress from severe bullying, guilting, shaming, belittling, demeaning &/or sexual abuse, or being a captive & unwilling witness to such being inflicted upon any other that you value relationally or emotionally, where one's rational awareness becomes separate from the sense of self & whatever feelings, sensations (physical hurt/injury, mental hurt, pain, grief, anguish, frustration; anger). This sense of separation is so deep that it's best described as, ""your thinking mind becomes the external watcher of the events & harms being done to 'the body', with no registration of pain & injury being committed ""it"". The ""physical shell"" is no longer perceived as ones' self (""me""). One symptom of this is anhedonia - the inability to feel sadness, sorrow, happiness or joy. The best example is a cutter who inflicts self injury in the hopes of creating enough pain to finally make themselves ""feel"" something. 
Like, I can tell you in fine detail of my physical, emotional, social & sexual abuse, but there's no emotional reaction to it, it's just the facts. Same as, no matter how kindly, tenderly & sincerely someone physically touches this body that remains, you're not touching ""me"".
In ""disassociate personality disorder"" <aka ""multiples"">, the distancing from the abuse drives ""self"" to preserve its core by fracturing off the injured ""other"" & the memories that triggered the break & presents the external ""person"" perceived to be needed so the ""body"" may survive.

Thing is, many have such a deep hole of need/yearning that one person (or the few you might be blessed to know) can't fill it. So they get overwhelmed & feel so inadequate they eventually fade out. 
Also sadly true, some depressed individuals have burned out (or been burned/betrayed so deeply) & fallen into anhedonia where their feels have become so numb the good/healing feels & touch don't get in. (In severe cases, they don't even register). Those with trauma (physical or sexual abuse/rape) induced PTSD may also be dealing with disassociation of self.

Okay. It rests in that, just as anxiety can have different levels, so too can depression. Mild depression, moderate depression, chronic (long term over years) depression & major (dehabilitating <paralyzing> depression. 
Personally, mine eases off on rare occasions, has been chronic since the age of 6 (after initial shock from the sexual assault I had no one ""safe"" to tell wore off) & gets really bad (active suicide attempt).at times. 
Generally, even severely depressed persons don't want to die, they're looking for a 'permanent' relief from their suffering &/or get away from the cause of their suffering. 
For myself, I viewed the path of education as a means to physically remove myself from my antagonists & abusers - moving out of state to go to college. I didn't ""excel"" at it,  but struggled to keep up & get all the work done to keep going (graduated in the lowest allowed GPA range). I chose at young age to choose & act rationally regardless of how bad I felt. My emotions would have kept me paralyzed. Yes, ""feels"" ARE valid - they're neither ""good"" or ""bad"" - it's what you do (or don't do) with them. But they aren't cold hard reality. When you have the place or someone truly safe to express them, feel your feels. But to survive, you 1st have to choose to do what's needed to exist/survive. Then keeping on keeping on doing studies, graduating & even working day to day thereafter (or whatever it is needful in the moment for you) - regardless of how onerous getting out of bed & just ""doing"" is each da. For me, this was an act of self validation my family of origin couldn't & wouldn't provide. *I* have to choose each day to commit to the simple belief ""I can do this & get through this"". After all, If I won't even act like I believe in myself, how can I lament, gripe & justifiably complain that ""no one"" else will stick up for me?"

AskMechanics,fqbidhy,t3_ghs17g,1589237545.0,"This may or may not help. I used to drive a 1998 Chevy that set a countdown timer when you turned on either turn signal, & if your signal didn't auto cancel after a turn... Or YOU didn't cancel it after a lane change, after 90 seconds, a bell would start ringing until you cancelled the signal. 
It likely ran off an induction pulse counter that kept counting down as long as the flasher circuit was active. Then, cancelling the signal cut the circuit which triggered the relay to shut off the bell. 
This cut out would work on the same principle but in reverse: The ignition energizes at on & starts a count down timer. If no energy passes through the left turn flasher loop, opening the relay to stop the counter, it keeps running & @ 0000 triggers a relay to kill the ignition (& conceivably also it could trigger an alarm). Thus it's a simple induction loop sensor on the left turn signal flasher circuit branch set to open the countdown timer circuit as soon the left signal is actuated, killing the timer so it won't zero & trigger the cut out relay on the ignition wire.

If you retain the capacity to externally be encouraging & kind to others even when inside you feel dead, then you have every good reason to hope. 
It's a mystery that's hard to understand.... 
If you've been bullied or abused, neglected & abandon in any way... ignored & invalidated... sometimes it creates a deep internal divide. You feel compassion towards others you grasp are, in their own way hurt & suffering... And desire to give them what you once longed for but gave up on never having: patience, the benefit of the doubt, kindness or at least civilly in the face of cruelty, perhaps even mercy and grace. 
We get so good at trying to be caring toward others    - even strangers. BUT, we just don't ""get"" how to be genuinely gentle or kind to ourselves.
May you find your way to that, to peace and, in time even one you can truly call your friend. 
Take care and be careful out there."

Honestly? At the point you don't ""feel"" anything, nothing feels like it will ever be ""enough"". From experience, a lot of days, you've just got to hang in there enough to exist.

It will start very small, but....  Even for those very very small moments, you'll start to feel just a hint of something at least ""okay"".

Yes. You're depressed from all of that. It's TOTALLY normal with where you're at right now. 
But, mainly it's grief. 
I generally sense you're self medicating with weed & alcohol to numb the hurt. Honestly, you can't drink or toke or consume/intake enough of anything that's out there to fill that hole. As HARD as it is,  despite what anyone may tell you, you've gotta feel your feels, cry.... Blubber like a 2 year old who's just skinned their knees...  Find someone you can trust who's NOT ""a fixer"" but who'll listen no matter how crazy it sounds & talk it out...   Admit & Allow your anger - scream, cuss, go pound a punching bag - just don't bottle it up or blow up & take it out on those you care about - INCLUDING yourself. 
But, remember, grief has no time table - things getting better over time is different for everyone, so don't ever let anyone dis you or tell you ""let it go"", ""suck it up"" or ""get over it"".
I second the advice to seek out a therapist if you can find & afford one. In some areas there are ""grief"" support groups made up of people who've gone through such as this themselves. Find one if you can. 
As has been said, given your mom's alcoholic history, you're at high risk for going down that path yourself. If you find it difficult to put the substances down, it might be beneficial to seek out an AA group as well. No one can ""fix this"" for you - not even you. 
Life will never go back to the old ""normal"". The goal now is to build a new & different normal that you can find some peace, joy & purpose in. That will take time. For a while, nothing is going to motivate you. Sometimes the only motivation you can start with is to remember that it was getting better with your dad before he died & working towards doing things you think might have made him proud. 
Also, it's sometimes helpful to ""get outside of yourself"", so since you looked forward to getting to do things with your dad, you might find some peace in ""paying it forward"" by finding some positive way to be a mentor to some kid or kids who never even had a dad. 
These are just ideas & suggestions. Take what you like and leave the rest.    You ever need an ear, you've got one here.

Personally... 
There are 3 ""friendships"" I was involved in that went south. One with a youth minister about 3 years older than me - from (my)  age 14 to ~22 yrs old.  One with a college peer that was about my age that lasted roughly 3 years. And, finally, one where he's almost 32 years my junior which went for about 4.5 years. As with you, the ""details"" of why aren't for open discussion, but all three have the same roots in common. 
After passage of some time, I made overtures trying to seek understanding & (for me) hopefully reconciliation with the 1st two. Both have never responsed... the latters' (college guy's) wife responded ""all is forgiven"" [though, in my biased opinion, remediation was due on BOTH sides] - but he never has. 
The last? That's a humdinger where I did some very brazen things that he ""struggled"" with, but it was his insecure (then) fiance, sister & mother who threw me under the bus & then HE kept his mouth shut & didn't step up to bat for me. I had nothing to apologize for as as I was always forthright & transparent with him & HE never voiced concerns - only the others on the outside looking in.


About a year later, he came looking for me...    It's not the same as it was ""before"" (for me)... but we committed to protecting our friendship & being there for each other & today (6ish years later) he's the sole one I've ever called my best friend.

All the advice u/nblackhand gave is awesome,  as well as the advice for your mom to draw out the accounts cash & report all credit cards as stolen. From my personal experience, she should also report to the situation to the credit bureaus as well to issue no credit cards or on line credit/loans in her name for at least the next 9 months or more. Work with a local bank to get a new credit card solely in her name through them. 
The council to request an attorney be appointed to solely represent the children's interests is also valid. 
Now... From that same experience, I'm a guy who's dad 1st walked out when I was 9. He showed back up when I turned 11 & mom tried to make it work, but he ran off for good when I was between 13 & 14...
Before anything else, KNOW without a doubt, this is NOT yours or your siblings fault.


After that, I hope you grow in time to understand that, although this may be ""all"" your dads fault, that it could also be that whatever drove him to leave could be part of both their faults, BUT that's theirs to know & you knowing or not knowing isn't really gonna change the situation.


I'm pride prouder than words that you're concerned about how to help & what to do in the situation. That's wiser & smarter than most of kids your age. 
In this situation, know too that it's totally normal to feel scared, anxious/uncertain, confused, hurt, sad & angry - each by themselves and all at once. It truly is overwhelming.  If you have someone you trust to vent them out to & talk them out, do that. Folks don't fully know how you feel or what & why you're thinking or feeling what you are & they can't fix it for you. You gotta work out what's best for you. 
Do what you can to help but DO also take time to enjoy things you like, have fun & chill where you can & live rather than to live giving all your time to ""fix it"" & miss having a life. 


For me, I understood early that, just like everybody else, including me, my parents, before they ever became my mom & dad, were people first - imperfect & totally able to screw things up at times without meaning to or trying. You can't fix that nor is it something anybody should have to fix. So,  live in today just doing ""the 'best right thing' "" for the situation right in front of as best you know how. Then let it go. 


The next was to remember that: How others act - regardless of what they say, justs shows you who they really are. How YOU react back at them, shows folks who You are.

As for sex & theology, no where does the actual Word of God, by example, inferred dictate or actual command that a cleric, preacher or priest be celibate. Had that been true, under the old law the priestly line, unless they practiced kidnapping or clandestine rape/fornication (in God's eyes utterly disqualifying them AS priests) would have died out....  And under the ""New"" law, although it's noted that marrying does hinder full devotion to laboring in the kingdom, it's expressly stated that it's better for a man TO marry rather than burn - with lust, or in hell for secretly ""fulfilling"" those lusts outside of marriage. 
That a priest MUST be celibate is a false doctrine never espoused by ANY 1sf century Apostles teaching & without precedence or example in the old law.  So, in wedlock (it's rightful setting) they're not mutually exclusive."
