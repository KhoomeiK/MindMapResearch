She's extremely immature as well. I have been in huge fights with my husband, most back when we were dating, and we might go in separate rooms for 30min to relax but then continue speaking to each other after. Ignoring someone is not healthy, especially for TWO WEEKS. Sounds like you've put up a lot for her and she hasn't put in much effort at all. Either a big long serious talk is next, or just part ways... But thinking the latter may be the best option at this point."

It's not bad to do games with the dog but I was told it's bad to let the dog decide what they're going to do. I think it's preference on how you want your dog trained but this technique usually works to make them eat regularly.

I was answering the question of how long the $600 was around for but should have included info about the eligibility side of it. Well maybe she can talk to her boss and see if they'll allow her to stay furloughed despite them being open and she could still qualify. My place of employment is open and never did close, but I got furloughed because I had no work, so I qualify. The place can be open and you still get the money, only if your boss furloughs you and says they currently don't need you. If the boss is reasonable, this could be an option."

If hospitals can be prepared to take on large groups of sick people with proper PPE (and LOTS of it), back up ventilators, maybe have the proper equipment to be able to build FEMA type tents outside in the parking lot, and we won't have to shut down. We primarily were shit down because hospitals needed to get keep from being ""overrun"". Some hospitals did better than others.

I only know my perspective and those around me. I don't personally know anyone struggling so I only have the perspective of those who aren't. I'm trying to learn what is causing people to struggle right now. I guess I can see if you go 3 weeks without pay while you wait on unemployment could be tough. But once you do get unemployment you're set. And yes the long term can be an issue. I honestly didn't consider those who may not be able to get their old job back. That could cause struggles later.

I know there are people struggling, I guess I was trying to figure out if it people who weren't struggling prior to the virus are struggling now, or if it was only people who had financial struggles before the virus. Honestly, if the government realizes that people need the additional $600 a week to live without a job then they need to reconsider minimum wages for people who work in grocery stores or restaurants.

So that plus the $1200, I'd say people should be doing fine. It seems like a majority of the people struggling now either were already struggling before the virus, or are not spending their stipends correctly and blaming not being able to work and SAH orders for their struggles. Am I missing something? Don't get me wrong, I feel for anyone who struggles. I've been doing my part in eating at local restaurants as much as I can within my budget to help out.

We had no guests other than the officiant and his wife (she did my hair and makeup) and our photographer. We set up a tripod and cellphone to live stream our wedding to our friends and families (this was a huge hit!). We had an absolute blast at this intimate ceremony. It helped we were close friends with the few people there. Right after we did photos and went home. A sweet friend of hours delivered breakfast, champagne, and orange juice to our doorstep while we were at our ceremony. We ate breakfast together and just enjoyed the rest of our morning together as husband and wife. Since we can't go on a real honeymoon right now and most places are shut down, we decided to get a suite at a ""luxury"" hotel in the downtown area we live. It has a rooftop pool and deck. Pool was closed but the deck was open. Husband's family lives out of town, and unfortunately in a hotspot for the virus, so seeing them was a no go. My family lives 10min away and wanted to see us. So they also got a room at the same hotel, brought drinks and food, and we parties on that rooftop deck all day. There was NO ONE at the hotel and we had the deck to ourselves all day. We had sooo much fun. We retreated to our rooms pretty early to have some us time before passing out. 

Overall I freaking loved it and would do it all over again the same way! To be honest, I wanted to elope, or at the very least, have a family only wedding but his family wouldn't go for it. While I was very upset all my planning went down the drain, I was secretly happy to do this intimate ceremony. I didn't mind the live stream at all.

wedding,fnwvueo,t1_fnwu6bm,1587326450.0,Ours was yesterday as well! Congrats!

wedding,fnwrbb1,t1_fnwpd2o,1587323910.0,Thank you! Me too! Our photographer did such a good job of not making it look like we were in a backyard in the middle of a neighborhood!
wedding,fnwr8x0,t1_fnwosld,1587323873.0,Thank you so much! I was so disappointed at first but ended up having so much fun. I loved how intimate it was!
physicianassistant,fnpnqvc,t1_fnplikc,1587148736.0,"Ah dang. My license is stored in an online database for employers to look up at anytime. Does your license have something like that, and then you can screenshot it?

Edit to add: I'm a respiratory therapist. Not a PA"
physicianassistant,fnoopjw,t1_fnn17y7,1587130441.0,You can just upload your medical license. It says that will qualify.
wedding,fnn5iof,t3_g2gvsj,1587084859.0,Congrats! Picture is beautiful. We are eloping in 2 days in lieu of our canceled ceremony! We cannot wait!
lifehacks,fnjf1ze,t3_g21o7w,1586997658.0,I've seen people do this at the beach or pool. Not a terrible idea. I know I wouldn't touch it.
greenville,fndpc9r,t1_fndlz3s,1586874916.0,Ahhh thanks so much for this information. I did not know that. I thought after I applied I just did nothing until I was approved. This makes sense though. I went in and did this! So glad I saw this.
greenville,fndhes5,t1_fncfoar,1586870058.0,"After we apply for the first time, were supposed to keep applying weekly even if we haven't been approved yet?"
unpopularopinion,fn8n0ki,t1_fn7pwv7,1586745413.0,"Agreed. I feel weird enough crying in front of my close friends and family. I'd feel even more weird filming myself doing such. I couldn't make myself ever post something like that on social media for the world to see. And yes, I work in health care as a respiratory therapist. Thankfully I'm not inpatient anymore. But I just can't imagine doing this. It's just weird as fuck."
RBI,fn8m6xl,t1_fn7wi4c,1586744850.0,This story was extremely creepy. Seemed like I was reading the plotline for a horror movie or something...

CysticFibrosis,fn5eaco,t3_fzl6t4,1586662609.0,"The people doing newborn screens have no clue what they're reading. They just get the results from the blood and the computer spits out terminology like ""positive"" ""borderline"" etc. They then send it to the pediatrician who also typically do not know all the ins and outs of the CF parts of newborn screening. It can say ""CF gene mutation detected"" and the child still not have it. But the pediatrician sees that and tells the parents they have CF. If yours says no CF gene detected, there is a chance another value associated with CF (for example IRT level) could be out of whack signaling the ""borderline"" phrasing. The next step will be sweat test and potentially gene sequencing which is just more blood tests to look at ALL CF mutations (newborn screen only looks at the most common ones). The whole newborn screen thing is a relatively new concept in terms of discovering CF early on. So a lot of people are still learning the process. I work at a CF clinic in SC and we have been sending packets of information to and providing education on CF for the pediatricians. It's new for a lot of people.


All that to say. Don't worry too much about what that paper says and what the pediatrician says until you visit a CF clinic and/or get a sweat test performed. And since your child is not showing the typical symptoms of CF at this point, definitely don't freak out yet! Doesn't mean they don't have it, but even if they do, it's extremely mild at this point. If you do want more information on CF just to be educated and understand more, I would recommend ONLY looking at Cystic Fibrosis Foundation website as opposed to just googling and randomly clicking on websites. 


Keep us updated and know that you have a whole support system here. You have parents of children with CF, CF folks themselves, as well as people (like me) who work at a CF center or with CF patients!"
wedding,fmy0voe,t3_fy1u35,1586475772.0,"I saved this idea to do with ours. Buttt I forgot about it and threw the cards away üò≠ I'm the type of person to hate holding on to random non-useful stuff. And I saw this and was like omg this is great, cuz they're sentimental and you can hold on to them in a creative, more useful way. And I freaking forgot.

Anywho. This looks fantastic! üòç"
interestingasfuck,fmqrlw4,t3_fwoli8,1586305557.0,"We just have a TV and a decent size monitor in the living room. Each with their own Xbox. So we can play our own games, play co-op on different screens, or watch different screens but still sit together. Been together almost 4 years and never fought over the screen! Haha."
assholedesign,fmorre3,t1_fmntskw,1586267087.0,Hahah right. It isn't foolproof. Just helps reduce the amount of potentially infected people. Can't stop all of them.
assholedesign,fmn6tse,t1_fmn0tjg,1586219423.0,Mostly for infection control. It's the only thermometer that doesn't have to touch the patient. It's definitely not the most accurate but eliminates cross contamination. Source: work at doctors office
greenville,fmiyfon,t3_fviz7c,1586119429.0,"I went to Publix downtown Greenville yesterday afternoon around 11am and was able to find some there. All they had left was 4 packs and it was limited to one per group. I'd say wherever you try, do it first thing in the morning after the senior time when shelves are stocked."
greenville,fmi9aur,t1_fmi1syz,1586105005.0,"Well right. It technically would be overwith quicker. But like I mentioned, then our hospitals get run down. Even people who are otherwise healthy have had to be admitted with this virus. So there would be tons of people who think they'd be fine if they caught it and still get extremely ill. Yes it's their choice to take the risk. I just worry about our ICUs getting over filled and not having enough resources to take care of people who get it. The longer it's stretched out, will give us more time to get vaccines and treatments ready. After that, then whatever. We need to use this time now to keep people home and healthy so we can get all our (the hospital/pharmacies/CDC/etc) shit together. No one was prepared for this at all and it's gonna be a shit show if the whole state/US gets infected at the same time."
greenville,fmi0xtt,t1_fmhwown,1586099997.0,"I have stopped going out. But many other people haven't which is what worries me... I work in health care and see the shitty side of this virus first hand. It's awful to watch it especially in the older adults that just can't fight it. The quicker we just make people stay home, the quicker this over. If people don't start staying home, the hospitals will be overrun and we don't have the resources for it. I don't see what the problem is..."
