The prank was executed flawlessly, I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing and was practically crying from tears until I realized she was staring up at me angrily from the floor, as were all of my classmates. And then I turned back to my lab partner and remembered she was wearing a cast from breaking her wrist. I was mortified and just completely stunned until my classmates started yelling at me to apologize and my teacher certainly wasn‚Äôt impressed either. I still cringe hard at that one. I did snap out of it quickly enough to help her up but that one still gets to me."

Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club

Our songs, our films, united, we stand

Our country, guess it was a lawless land

Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand

Paper cut stings from my paper-thin plans

My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust

Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up

Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough

But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts"
