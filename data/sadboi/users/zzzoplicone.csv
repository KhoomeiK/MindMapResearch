Chriswatts,fr4ufvm,t3_gmab9l,1589897089.0,"Respectfully, I don’t think law of attraction has anything to do with it. 
It’s based on the premise that you can create your own reality through intentions, thoughts and believing you can create your own reality. The reason people use vision boards is to help visualize things you are attempting to materialize... you see them, so you think about it more often. 
I don’t think she inadvertently sent the universe the wrong message with joking about Chris killing her. Hell, she hyper focused on having a perfect marriage, ideal family, great dad to her kids... 
If she manifested anything, it was finding such a pussy of a significant other, that he lacked the balls to simply divorce her when he found someone that gave him more anal sex than she did."
science,fr1q2fb,t1_fr1dttc,1589824016.0,How do you acquire it?
hbo,fr1dzeh,t3_glu9tl,1589818050.0,"Good review. I’ll def subscribe to your content.
Like most HBO series, it’s very well done. I don’t know why but I find it much darker and depressing than the book. Obviously, same content... so I don’t know why... maybe I paced the book more slowly than each episode.
Certainly grateful for the killer soundtrack... it kind of helps to hear so many great songs in the middle of the darkness. 
Also, the actors (especially Ruffalo) are nailing the characters. Usually when a series or movie comes from a book, the characters end up being slightly different than how I perceived them to be. But he is playing Dominic/Thomas exactly as written. 
Thanks again! Look forward to more reviews."
QuittingTianeptine,fqqhw0h,t3_gk9kbt,1589565799.0,"I’ve been clean from (10 plus daily doses) of tia sodium for 3 months. I quit tramadol about 3 weeks after I quit Tianeptine. 
My sleep gradually improved over time. I’m able to sleep longer and deeper as time goes by. Honestly, my sleep is still not what it was (drug free) baseline. But, I’ve abused sleeping pills in the past prior to the tia addiction. (Hence the user name) The truth is: even though I’m sleeping less and absolutely cannot “sleep in” to save me life, I do wake up feeling fully rested and ready to go.
I still battle with depression. However, I always have... I mean, honestly, I would have never gotten in the tia trap had I not had some issues leading up to it. While it’s still there at times, I can honestly say, it’s no where close to the level of depression and shame I had when I was
abusing. 
I still have cravings. Never, ever for tia... but I’m
always looking for an immediate fix for the internal void. I believe therapy, mindfulness, and meditation could help me. If only it came in a pill form... I might actually do it. Lol. 
Those are the only minor issues I’m still experiencing. 
Congrats on getting off this poison. Keep it up. It keeps getting better."
QuittingTianeptine,fqipa2w,t3_gj4av6,1589399045.0,"Congrats on quitting this poison. I had several, significant physical issues while taking “heroic”, regular doses of tia sodium. Once I stopped tia, all issues ceased and I recovered completely.
That being said, the only heart issue I had was moderately high blood pressure for the first time in my life. 
My husband abused tia similarly and had extremely high blood pressure. Once at ER they thought their machine was malfunction because it was so high. But a second machine yielded the same blood pressure. He quit cold turkey after this and after acute withdrawals went back to normal blood pressure. 
Anyway, I know this doesn’t help you much but wanted to share. 
Hoping the best outcome for you and keep the thread updated please."
DelphiMurders,fqhpvci,t3_gixtus,1589381998.0,"I would think/hope that the fbi and investigators combed through any and all students, teacher aids, teachers, social contacts the girls had leading up to the murder. 
I don’t think the murderer had any connection to the girls other than being at the same place at the same time."
QuittingTianeptine,fqhn6i3,t3_girw8u,1589380411.0,"Hope it helps you. 
In my experience, Doxepin did not help me in acute withdrawals or PAWs. Doxepin doesn’t even help me much in normal (non-withdrawal induced) insomnia."
gabagoodness,fqds9wm,t1_fpwrpml,1589295708.0,Lol. Do you honestly think our gvmt has the time or resources to set up online “honeypots” to bust people purchasing 90 gaba-fucking-pentin?
QuittingTianeptine,fq619f8,t3_ggdr8y,1589122367.0,"Word. 
Highly unreported, disgusting side effect of tia addiction.
I had the worst case of it in February, a few weeks before I quit. My doctor prescribed some anti-fungal lozenges that didn’t even touch it. It took 2 rounds of heavy anti-fungal meds in addition to all of the normal remedies, as you mentioned in your post. 
I’ve only had two times during PAWs when I considered relapsing before sanity returned. Interestingly, when I started trying to talk sense into myself about how bad it would be to buy tia again, my first thought was the horrific February thrush I went through. The taste. The discomfort. The inability to swallow, let alone taste. 
Then I forced myself to remember the days of acute withdrawal and days/weeks of moderate agony to follow. But thrush was the first memory my brain threw me when searching for reasons I hate this shit. 
So, yeah. Nasty."
QuittingTianeptine,fq13o84,t3_gggugm,1589041302.0,"So, you were still taking same dose of sodium and phenibut as usual? The only difference was adding gabapentin?"
gabagoodness,fq0miaw,t3_gga5px,1589034319.0,"All of this is true. I’ve been stuck in addiction with this drug for two decades. I’m currently on a fairly low dose for myself and fluctuate between determination to taper and have a tough 18 months of returning to baseline OR staying on forever. 
I’ve never heard anyone mention the sensory/everything is dirty aspect. This is something i just started realizing recently. It does FEEL horrible and turns a simple cleaning chore into futile mania."
PublicFreakout,fpvmcg3,t1_fpql46k,1588947648.0,"That’s true. More to the story is there actually was only ONE theft in their neighborhood in the previous months. No string of thefts. No black suspect. But that’s completely irrelevant to the murder. 

So, sure. If you are the type that needs more info than a video of three men with guns lynching someone, feel free to dig around more."
foodnetwork,fprhh21,t1_fprcqtc,1588854252.0,"True. It was still all day, back ground noise watchable then. 
I used to watch food network when it all started: how to boil water, grillin n chillin, taste, cooking live with Sara moulton every weekday night, Julia Child, etc. There was a great mix of amateur disaster, genuine talent, creativity, and old school masters. 
It hasn’t been that good in a LONG time."
gabagoodness,fppg7h3,t3_geqjau,1588801693.0,"If you quit the gabapentin cold turkey, it could be withdrawal symptoms. Pregablin should eliminate any residual withdrawal."
gabagoodness,fpop2pa,t3_geopx6,1588788220.0,"I’ve taken them together. This isn’t medical advice, just personal experience."
DelphiMurders,fpo4j1w,t1_fplreuz,1588778237.0,"I agree. They case is clearly cold no matter what they say to the contrary. 
Releasing the full audio/video would help others possibly identify him."
mentalillness,fpk45v0,t3_gdtbjj,1588687627.0,"I struggle with this too and almost always end up in a cycle of substance abuse rather than finding healthy ways to cope with the void. 
The worst part of depression is that the only way out is to do things you absolutely feel like you can’t do: talk to others, ask for help, exercise/vitamin D, meditation, finding a new hobby, etc. The longer I stay depressed, the more difficult it becomes to find my way out. And, with me... depression always fools me into thinking this is the worst, most hopeless hole I’ve ever been in and will never end. But, here I am... emerging out of another one... and, realizing there is hope. 
And, I know this probably doesn’t mean much to you but I sincerely hope you feel better soon."
gabagoodness,fp8qebl,t3_gbpk7s,1588399616.0,"I have nothing to offer but sincere empathy. I’ve been through it many times... which only proves what an addict I am. Knowing how hard it is to withdraw and how long it takes to recover but doing it again and again is absolute insanity. 
Anyway, it does pass. I’d recommend baclofen and something to help with sleep. I didn’t have enough discipline to taper but if you can, it would be the easier, softer and way. 
You’ve got this. Honestly, the first time I quit, I
stayed off of everything for close to a year and felt honestly felt fantastic. The addict in me believed I had reset my tolerance and could enjoy one more nice buzz. Never happened... even with excessive doses. For some reason, I could never replicate what I felt in my early days of gaba abuse. Bittersweet, I suppose. Knowing I can’t get that fabulous buzz again makes me more determined to stay sober."

BravoTopChef,foftw5k,t3_g77tky,1587742739.0,Not rooting for him but don’t understand the overwhelming disdain for him on Reddit. He’s one of the weakest chefs on this season. That’s why I don’t like him.

Chriswatts,fo6dodb,t1_fo65s7m,1587555729.0,"Well, thank god he got that pregnant “hun”
off the streets before she victimized anyone else. And, that CeCe? My god, with her energy level... that poor dad. 
Everyone has a right to try to become internet famous by being “critical”, right?"
QuittingTianeptine,fnqm8zf,t1_fnb9twp,1587167451.0,"Thanks. I’m actually hit one month tia free last week. I basically used the subs just to make it through acute withdrawals. I didn’t feel any worse when I quit taking them after 3 days. 
I will reluctantly admit that while I’m happy to not be a slave to this shit anymore, I still don’t feel baseline yet. PAWs has been tougher than acute withdrawal. Granted, with or without tia, I think I’d feel pretty depressed during quarantine."
Christian,fnp7c3f,t3_g30qcx,1587140489.0,No
spirituality,fn3fvp0,t3_fz1u25,1586619900.0,"Yes. It’s particularly tedious with this isolation which is odd because I isolated prior to covid. I’m very grateful you shared this though because I’ve been so stuck in this headspace that I couldn’t even express it. 
The commentary has been extraordinarily helpful, too. 
Thanks to everyone!"
foodnetwork,fmffbae,t1_fmfecd3,1586026049.0,"GZ does. And, honestly, if I had his money, I’d absolutely have a kitchen that size. As for the wardrobe, I’d probably just have a lot more pairs of yoga pants and tennis shoes. But, to each their own. 
If you think his kitchen and wardrobe are something, you should see his wife."
Christian,fmepzq4,t1_fmeh67e,1586010861.0,Best pick up line ever! Amen. 🙏
QuittingTianeptine,fl59ueh,t3_fmgass,1584831786.0,No better time to quit than now. Dopamine will regulate over time.
QuittingTianeptine,fjuyie2,t1_fjuk5aa,1583621475.0,"I expect it will be tougher than I imagine. I really should have tapered this week. Actually, I planned very poorly and will likely be hitting acutes as I’m getting off plane. I have some tramadol and gabapentin to help the last few hours. 
Thanks again for sharing your experience, the referral, support, and answering all of my questions. I feel so defeated and empty after years of abuse and you offered me something I truly haven’t felt or believed in over a year: HOPE. I know it was just a referral to a stranger on a sub full of throw away accounts but I’m going to be a drama queen and say fuck that perspective. If I do this detox properly and dust off my recovery/sobriety tool bag, you literally saved my life. 
I know I have a long difficult journey (just cause it’s rehab doesn’t mean they do it for you)  but I can’t wait to truly be clean. 
One day, I look forward to paying it forward. 
Did you see my last message?"
