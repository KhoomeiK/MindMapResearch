What a disgusting thing to do to somebody. If this is real (which I'm questioning due to how messed up it is) you should be ashamed of yourself.

I am sure that an unplanned pregnancy is extremely stressful, especially if you have your own health problems, but by even saying the pregnancy birth wasnt 'happy' as such... I can see the older sisters hurt.
Having to financially support your child should NOT automatically equate to an unhappy pregnancy.

 Planned or not, she was still bringing life into the world and becoming a mom, just like the youngest daughter. 
I know it is two completely different situations, but even by reading your specific word choices to relay the two pregnancies suggests to me that there is more to this story that meets the eye. For your eldest to suggest you would be happy if she had health complications, combined with your list of all the things that made her pregnancy conventionally 'wrong' or 'bad', (young, no dad), just makes it look like you treated them completely differently. 

Although it was in the past, I definitely think you should apologise to your eldest and acklowledge that you hurt her"

There was a young boy the same age as him (15 or so) recently found dead in our area by suicide, and as they were friends, I wanted to check he was okay. He was lying in bed, with his eyes open. I asked him was he okay, no response, his eyes were completely glazed over, I honestly thought for a second that he was dead. I shook him so violently and basically shouted in his face and he woke up straight away. He was asleep with his eyes open. 
He had no idea what was going on, and didnt believe me when I told him. I didnt care that he was annoyed one bit, just relieved that he was okay.

I thought about it all the time, I didnt exactly know how it wat happen but I couldnt shake the feeling that it would be some sad death that people spoke about, a murder, a freak accident, something. I spoke about it to people who just gave me strange looks, but I felt so on edge that I couldn't help it. 
Then, a few months after turning 20, I had a terrible car crash. Basically unexplainable, car just slid off the road and into field.  Car completely written off, whole fence area where i hit completely mangled, but i was fine. I had a minor burn on my skin but that was it.
I havent felt the feeling since! Feel like I escaped fate or something. Or that it was a wake up call. Not sure, but I definitely narrowly dodged the young death I had predicted myself."
