videos,fqsifpd,t1_fqpyf5h,1589608156.0,"It really has more to do with how ancestry affected race politics and nationalism in the early 1900s. There was a large influx of Europeans immigrating to the country. Many of them settled right off the boat in the Northeastern US. While all were white which gave them higher status than blacks, there was a hierarchy from anti immigration and the resulting nationalist movement. 

So the majority of those descendants of European immigrants were always identified by others by their heritage and so they identified themselves that way. In those days your heritage often determined where you lived and people from the same country lived close to one another because they spoke the same language and it made life easier. My grandparents all lived in ""Italian"" neighborhoods. So they lived in a way that constantly reaffirmed their heritage, and then that was passed onto their kids. Now, with my generation it's beginning to kind of fade out."
