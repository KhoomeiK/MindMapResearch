LGBTeens,eoldssj,t3_bs7qr7,1558669265.0,"I would suggest that you be safe about it, for me, my dad threatened me with violence if i ever came home with a guy, so it wouldnt have been safe for me to go to any pride parade (because i relied on them for transport and i was/am closeted) if you think you can successfully pull it off then go! it all depends on the specifics of the situation. I would also advise you to come up with specific answeres to their questions. 


Ex:

‚ÄúHey, op, how was the mall, what did you do?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMe and friend x went to the food court and ate the free samples and then we went to hot topic and (insert your favorite store here). We had a lot of fun‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî




And if they give you money, or expect you to buy something, id stop at some random store and pick something cheap up and use the rest of the money for food or something. Please be safe and i hope you get to go!"
