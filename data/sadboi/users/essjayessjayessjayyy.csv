This sub has been a god send for me in adjusting to my diagnosis, and funnily enough  the memes are what helped me the most to understand myself.

The post-mania crash absolutely flogged me.  My mood has stabilised slowly slowly on Lamictal and I'm beginning to feel the depression fade away.

Finding your meds cocktail takes time.  As does being able to laugh at and forgive yourself for your past manic follies.  

Being stable will never feel as enticing as the euphoria of mania, but the life threatening, agonising depression that follows is enough to keep me from ever stoking a manic episode when I can feel it creeping up. 

So many people on here comment about their inability to function with daily chores and basics of living, even when stable.  

I guess what I'm trying to say is: even when stable bipolar really fucks with your quality of life, and I've had to drastically lower my expectations about what a good life looks like. 

I hope you have an easy adjustment to the diagnosis and treatment!  Good luck on your journey!  Stay in touch, the ppl on this sub are amazing"
