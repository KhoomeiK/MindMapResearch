depression,fbg0flk,t3_eczhm3,1576828250.0,"Wow... your family seems to forget everything or ignore everything else besides their own expectations and desires. What would they even get out of this? A fake happy family happy faces Christmas. Well - why does this sound so familiar to me? You know what: It already says everything unfortunately, how not supportive and ignoring they react about your mental health problems. So the following reactions not really a surprise. I have a very twisted family myself. It took me many years to really realize, that we may share blood, but I didn't sign any contract or my sould over to them. I'm too still in the process of setting barriers and learning to say no. Still there is a lot to work on and I may not want to completely stand my ground here, but for sure I'm done a lot with their shit! So I really really wish for you to be able to follow your heart, because from what you described here, yours is at the very right place. It's hard to feel judged and rejected. No matter if it's the family or anyone else. Even harder if you just try all the best you possibly could. I hear you! Following your heart I'd say will be surely the better way for you. Don't deny yourself because of pressure your family tries to put on you. If they say you ruin christmas it's their words but that doesn't mean it is true. It just mean they said so. But being real here: That's their issues, not yours! You are not responsible for their problems and they are not your fault. I wish to you that you'll be able to leave their shit with them and not let them put it on you. I also wish to you, that you find this special place in your heart and be able to let it spread and follow it. And for your friend I wish her also all the very best and that she hopefully will feel better soon! With a friend at her side like you, she for sure already have the best example how much she matters! All the best to you guys and much love."

You are so young, give it a chance, give yourself a chance and a bit more credit. You still have much time to learn so much"
SuicideWatch,fbdx1pk,t1_fbdvk48,1576773252.0,"Yes, I know you can't see it right now. I just hope you are able to keep it in your mind somewhere. 

About volunteering: Wanna give it a try? Just as suggestion. Perhaps you can find something near you? Reading to old people or spending time with them If they are alone, helping homeless people or just talk to them and find out their stories, or something else..."
SuicideWatch,fbdunj7,t1_fbdu240,1576771721.0,"Believe me I know how it feels. Wish you from the bottom of my heart that you will find the strength within you to keep on fighting and staying alive. And I want you to know, no matter how less you are able to see and feel this right now, that you matter! Sensitive people like you are important in this world we live in. Would volunteering for other people be something for you perhaps?"
SuicideWatch,fbdtqo2,t1_fbdtfzx,1576771128.0,That's the thing about hanging in there... Don't give up! I really wish you'll find light in life âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
SuicideWatch,fbdst1w,t1_fbdrkk9,1576770522.0,"Ever tried to go out alone or on concerts? Perhaps there you'll get to know some people? Just an idea, I know it's hard!! And being out in nature for sure is good. Breathe! That's so important."
SuicideWatch,fbdrgrv,t3_ecubua,1576769645.0,"I so feel you! My only reasons walk on four legs. I just can't let go because of them. In the other hand they are my life savers so far. And as long it is like that, I always keep the possibility in mind, that maybe my mind will change? Who knows... I wish to you for sure that your mind will change and that you'll be able to find something within you what makes you stay alive! I wish strenght to you and love for life and yourself so you have the power to see the world in a brighter light soon again. Please hang in there and keep on fighting.âœ¨ðŸ’«âœ¨"
SuicideWatch,fbdqn6n,t3_ectwxt,1576769103.0,Please try to hang in there. Where in Germany did you move to? Is there anything what Males you feel better or what you like? Perhaps like going for a walk (I love going in nights I can't sleep) or spending time in nature or anything else?
mentalhealth,fbdq9mi,t3_ecszb2,1576768852.0,"Yes, I know what you mean. The short feeling of relief, of being able to let out all the pain and pressure inside is very tempting once you had this as a coping mechanism. About 13 years or so back I too cuttet myself. The urge in certain situations always comes back. But I always remember how bad it looks and that it never goes away. I see my old scars and for luck bei able to resist. Nowadays I go to get tattoed. It is kinda a replacement. Not completely, since getting a tattoo is so much more and I just love it. And: There ain't ugly scars left but a beautiful artwork and even covers old scars."
SuicideWatch,fbdp8du,t3_ecrddi,1576768153.0,"So true. I get you! I can't get rid of my suicidal thoughts and His part of me, no matter if I even have a good laugh or not. It's always there."
depression,fbdov74,t3_ecr9zo,1576767903.0,Very good described! I also usually find it very hard to express how my demons feel like.
depression,fbdnh7z,t1_fbdnfet,1576766929.0,Tks a lot
depression,fbdnd2k,t1_fbdn3tw,1576766847.0,"I'd like to read this post, can you tell me where to find it?"
depression,fbddurg,t1_fbdd99n,1576758893.0,"Expressing is challenging... I mean finding the words to express best how it feels. That's super difficult. I challenge myself every day: Trying like you to be a better version of myself, trying not to quit therapy and life in general by trying to cope with my daily suicidal thoughts. Also try to find a way to understand this very dark part within me and also eventually to learn to live with my demons somehow without letting them win. Recently I described it to my therapist based on the story of the two wolves as an example. I think she understood the picture and it helped our sessions. Often it seems to me like our language and all the words within it aren't enough or expressions or words are missing. There are things what are out of reach for language - what seem to exist like 'between the lines'.

And: Thank you u/ceezee-jay ... I too wish you all the best and for you to feel better."
