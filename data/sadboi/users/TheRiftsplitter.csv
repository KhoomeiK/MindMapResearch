RimWorld,fqz4hjl,t3_g5bazx,1589759759.0,"Having a lot of trouble with combat in this game.

Have to restart encounters like 5 times during raids. Especially mechs.
I take cover behind my granite barricades and somehow still get one shot killed like 25% of the time. Or like with the mechs I can't outrun them and once they melee me it's over. Most of my colonists have permanent injuries at this point. One guy has brain damage which seems it can't be repaired on this game

I have steel plate armor and steel helmet and I still get my brain exploded by a short bow from 15 tiles away.

How do I increase my chances of surviving a raid. Or was this game suppose to kill a colonists every 5 days or so without save scumming."
