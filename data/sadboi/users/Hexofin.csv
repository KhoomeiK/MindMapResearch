HomeNetworking,fr3ec0c,t1_fr3bqg4,1589855576.0,"We live in a 2 story house and we have a netgear n600 downstairs. When I'm in the same room as the router I can get max speeds of 150, but an average of 50 down is more consistent. Around the rest of the house maybe we're getting 30 down.

That said we need consistent internet - We're having issues, for example, with connections to a corporate vpn that are really finicky and will disconnect you if the wifi stutters (this is upstairs). Speed doesn't matter if we're having trouble connecting in the first place.

We do have a few hardwired ethernet cables plugged into our rotuer, but they're not for anything super critical. One is a powerline ironically enough, but if the mesh works we won't need the stupid thing.

The only thing I can say for certain is that router must get replaced with something."

At least I miraculously a job in the summer, it seems. I know that when I'm working I'm at my most psychologically sound position - I have economic security, a sense of purpose since I like what I do, and I have an excellent routine. I think what I'll do is take the L for this one class, and finish studying all the stuff during the summer, and then when I retake the class, I'll just submit everything and get an A or something (it's programming stuff so if I figure it out, I figure it out).

I feel like I might be able to try and half ass it for a D and get the pass fail or whatnot, but I really want to be able to start from fresh with the class because I actually want to learn about the class in detail."

I think maybe down the line I'll go back to college years from now when I'm in a more stable position.

I've been thinking it over and I think a lot of the stress engineering students face is because they don't actually want to be engineers, they're just told ""take this path for economic success"". It may be true to an extent but the it can really eat away at one psyche. So now they're in debt in an economic hellscape taking classes they don't care about... I wonder if that's true to some extent for med school students. I think less so because engineering students can branch out way more than med students, they kinda have to do something medicine related."

Tbh looking back at my life the past several years I'm actually amazed I have a 2.9, it's astonishing considering the shit I've gone through.

Anyway if you're a low level manager at a big manufacturing company you start off with 72k but you'll be working maybe 10 hours a day, plus a bunch of weekends. You'll also rotate shifts. You can pull like 1000 if you work a Saturday and Sunday. There's not too much actual engineering because the correct move is to call the onhand specialist when something is wrong. Get the mechanic, electrican, whatever. If would be foolish to do those things yourself.

Don't beat yourself up too much, you're below average in a field of highly, highly exceptional people.

There's likely a serious reason why you don't have a great gpa, don't kid yourself, there's some underlying ball and chain around your ankle. Make sure it doesn't get too bad."

I also love music making too and I would have majored in it if it had a more secure income.

That said maybe I can offer you a sliver lining - I got an internship at a manufacturing plant and I ended up loving it waaay more than civil engineering. Also, the management was filled with engineers from my school, but none of them were actually doing engineering, mostly just management stuff - they just hired them as managers because there is some technical skill required, and they realized that ""engineering graduate"" can serve as a baseline level of smartness that they want."
