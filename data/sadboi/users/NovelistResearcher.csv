AskReddit,fnt3odx,t3_g3q7qg,1587234002.0,"Start by realising that it’s not selfish. Permanently putting the happiness of others above your own is not empathy, it’s self-neglect. Nobody will mind/care if you say “no” to them from time to time and, if they do, they’re not people you need in your life."
AskReddit,fnt3ds9,t3_g3p8h8,1587233839.0,"The type of food is less important than the fact that you’re doing it. Make something you know how to cook (less likelihood of it messing up), set a nice table/lap-tray/whatever you have and make an event of it. The gesture will doubtless mean more to them than the food. 

Also - it’s lovely you care but it’s not your job/responsibility and you don’t have to do it alone. Get help from family members if possible."

Pieces of delicious cake that people found elsewhere but claim to be home-made, poorly recreated bits of much better cakes and bits that look like delicious chocolate cake but turn out to be beetroot flan, shoved in by edgy teens who are sat in the corner waiting to see if you fall for it."
AskReddit,ff734d0,t3_erupvr,1579640166.0,"Personally speaking toned is attractive, looking like someone sewed boulders under your skin is not. Dancers, athletes etc have attractive bodies but those shiny bronze dudes in Speedo’s really don’t."
AskReddit,fendl0x,t1_femmn86,1579282403.0,"Both. If you get the chance to take a promotion/save some money etc then take it, but don’t ever pass up on chances to do (non-life threatening) reckless silly shit as well. Basically don’t be so busy winging it that you wind up jobless & broke, but don’t bust your ass to fit a meaningless ideal of success so much that you never have silly adventures :) (I’m 40 and this has been my lifestyle since 21. I’ve a good home, job, relationship and a million cool stories about stupid decisions that led to awesome adventures)"
GenderCritical,f7nykpd,t1_f7ni6sf,1573917597.0,This is such a difficult situation. Clearly they can’t let him continue being raped but I don’t think the women’s prison was the right option either. It’s probably the strongest case for prisons to have a specific trans wing tbh.
GenderCritical,f7ni7to,t1_f7luzn6,1573905014.0,Thank you for sharing this. Can you tell me what country you’re in please?

AskReddit,f7ldux3,t1_f7laheo,1573838343.0,"He might not have been aware that his words / actions were abusive beforehand but he would have seen your reaction afterwards. He would’ve been aware that he had hurt you and then made a conscious decision to ignore that. Abuse is not about anything you did “wrong”, it’s about him having a way to control you. You proved yourself by leaving him and taking back that control. :)"
AskReddit,f7ldi1f,t3_dwkvtl,1573838122.0,"It all comes down to semantics and self-justification. They know their behaviour will be looked upon unfavourably by others (hence intimidating their victim into not talking about it) so will justify it to themselves. 

Eg- “If she tells her friends I beat her, I’ll be arrested..but only coz they don’t get it either, they don’t know what it’s like to be *me* in this relationship..the stuff I put up with...I’d it wasn’t for me she wouldn’t survive, she’s too dumb to make it alone & if telling her doesn’t work how else am I supposed to do it?!..it wasn’t that hard anyway, she cries & makes a fuss but she’s childish like that...it’s why she needs someone like me in charge...” 

It’s all self-preservation. No matter what they did/said, the idea of ppl thinking they’re the bad guy is untenable so they find ways to twist it in their favour."

AskReddit,exel5hb,t1_excq4fq,1566218869.0,"It’s because a lot of Reddit is either young people who’ve not seen that much of life and still see their future as point A to B to Death, or older people who never took silly risks etc while young. Consequently neither are capable of seeing a life beyond their own or acknowledging that “crazy adventures” are possible."
AskReddit,ewlkvzf,t1_ewlkjfn,1565528247.0,"So far it’s all of the support-group variety. They want to be able to discuss their desires in a place where they won’t be insta-reported etc. There are also a couple of registered charities currently working with self-confessed paedophiles in order to prevent them from ever offending, who have their own pages. There are some dodgier-looking groups that I’ve not explored fully due to the content listed on the home page and also one which I reported outright as they were clearly a front for a pics/vids exchange."
AskReddit,ewlf86t,t1_ewk4fvi,1565521376.0,The rest have been looking for online paedophile communities / blogs. Primarily to see if they exist outside the dark web (they do) and also if anyone in them would talk to me (they did).

AskReddit,ewjxs9j,t3_comdkw,1565473661.0,Currently writing a (non-fiction) book about the acceptance of paedophilia in online communities. 80% of my searches for the last month probably have me on some kind of list (NB - they’re mostly for scholarly psychology articles).
