AskMen,fj5drse,t3_fbmrya,1583030260.0,"I've suffered from lonliness for a lot of my life and in my experience it's something you have to embrace fully and can be a very powerful thing if you let it be. Focus on yourself, practice mindfulness, see what improves your moods (weather it's music, gaming etc...), Try therpy and just get to the root of the problem. 

I.e. If your lonley by choice, or your lonley due to anxiety issues then you have two choices:

1) escape the circle your in by slowly exposing yourself to being around more and more poeple, start slow by just walking around places with noise canceling headphones in just getting used to the image of people instead of the noise. Then take it up to the next step and start interacting with people, i did this through playing PokÃ©mon Go and just talking to random poeple, eventually you realise you meet the same people each community day and you can then work your way up to a conversation instead of a ""hi"". Alternatively try being involved in societies, if your still in university do clubs and things just don't say no and let anxiety get the better of you. Don't be the type of person that makes excuses - just take it slow, the steps you take don't need to be big, they just need to be in the right direction. 

2) Accept lonliness fully, like I said above it can be a powerful thing if you let it be. See what makes you happy and be introverted - there is nothing wrong with that. Often people who suffer from lonliness just don't like people and that's completely fine. Be happy on your own. Even accept a religion and make God your companion. Just be content with your choice.

The other choice is if your someone like me and your lonley by circumstance. E.g. you've finished education and life just hasn't been kind, you've never been able to make freinds and you live with an abusive family who won't let you out of the house. In this case escaping chronic lonleyness is more difficult as it require a change in lifestyle. Weather that's finding a job and moving away from the family home, thus allowing you the freedom you need. But sadly with this, you need to make the active change otherwise you'll fall into depression, but again you need to find what that change is for yourself and don't be envious of others (E.g. on social media) and trying to achieve the life that others have if that makes sense? If you want online freinds then Reddit is full of them, from r/foreveralone or r/lonley can point you in the direction to make online freinds. Do the best you can do with the hand life has dealt you - compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not who someone else is today.

Good luck and I hope your in good health."
