But after her sudden death last December. I was really hurt. How her lost affects me a lot. I feel like I have to live. I don't want to meet her when I'm in my worst self. 

I still have to live and I will continue living until its my turn to go.

I want to meet her in heaven so I have to live.

I hope you continue living even after she's not here with you anymore."

depression,f7gkza7,t3_dw3y79,1573707073.0,I'm the opposite of you. The only thing that made still alive is my mother. I only thinks about her so that I can move forward with my life. I have a few best friend around but I don't want to bother them with my problems and feeling. I hope we both got someone to talk to even though we don't know them.
