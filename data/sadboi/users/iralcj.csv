FreeEBOOKS,fmxedl7,t3_fv0cu4,1586463425.0,Agatha Christie is my favorite author. I'm trying to look for other authors who write about murder mysteries or crimes and such.

TheSocietyNetflix,fbee33l,t1_fbed3ka,1576783836.0,Well yea. I think the last coin toss at the debate was a subtle hint to the previous coin toss. I hope it is. Because the first one was quickly dismissed by everyone right after it was heads. Maybe something happened to make it heads. Hmm.

It's sad because now I just try to be careful being sad around them."

Sometimes all you need is someone who totally understands the way you feel, even though both of you are depressed. It really is okay not to be okay, sometimes."
