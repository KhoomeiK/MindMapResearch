I have set unrealistic expectations in therapy from the start and I also feel that hopelessness but I think it would be beneficial If we just lowered our expectations. 

I sometimes dont see my T as a person either. After all, I know nothing about this person who I see. Will a coworker not answer my call or text if we are both not at work together? She usually wont reply unless there is a cancellation. My coworkers would answer any day. Sometimes I feel like she is just willing to do the bare minimum. I also feel like they are just seeing me because they need the money. We all need money, particularly during this time. All of her other clients dropped out and Im still paying her. I cant stop but feel like Im just settling.
