It strikes a balance between realism and impressionism that might not be an appropriate reference to his time, but that resonates with me as a viewer. I think it's how he balances his use of white, red, and yellow against a darker palate without being too stark in the contrast that appeals to me, which incidentally is one of my issues with Vermeer, but I diverge. 

Lovely share :)

I, however, don't recommend one *say* one is looking for work if one is not. That would be falsifying information. The weekly certification asks if you certify that everything you have said is correct. DES provides you with a sheet to document all the people you have contacted in your work search. They tell you to hold onto that paper for five years in case of an audit. If you are audited and your certifications say you looked for work, but you can't demonstrate that to be true it could be a paperwork headache.

As to the rest, my personal understanding is that once you are *allowed* to work you lose unemployment benefits because you are no longer covered under COVID loss of work, it becomes a ""personal choice"". This has been one of the tricky parts other people in states that opened more recently have discovered. Stay home and earn nothing or go to work and face losing everything.

The ellipsis is also common in poetry at the caesura and has made a step from that into colloquial writing to the same effect.

There are smaller tricks you can do with multiple shot builds that can look cool. Or different types of cocktails that the craftsmanship of them can have a dramatic effect. Stuff that gets lit on fire usually falls in that category. I don't normally think of that as flairs, but they can add to the performance appeal of bartending. 

Again, they aren't really necessary, but it depends on the place. At the end of the day, a lot of bartending isn't what's in books or tricks. 

Depending on where you go, it's cutting fruit, washing glasses, changing kegs, talking to people, knowing your spirits/beer/wine in as much as your cocktails ... it can be pretty labor intensive. So be prepared for those things as well. :)"

Apparently they are buried under a mountain of financial responsibility to all these retirees and are no longer drawing enough revenue to pay those benefits with the assurance they once could.

But I'll share a quick story with regards to your graduation. My Nana was like a father to me growing up and also like a grandfather. She was the only grandparent I ever had. She developed dementia. It sucked. Her husband (my mom's father) graduated from the same college I attended. I went because of him. He was alumni president for a few years, so my gran was also fond of the school, too. When she started getting older she used to say, ""you know, I might not be around much longer."" This drove my mom crazy. When the dementia came, she started saying it constantly. My mom and her sister were beside themselves. So I started telling Nana, ""Listen, I graduate in December of X. You can do whatever you want after that."" When this started I had 18 mos left of school but wouldn't walk until winter. So she and I carried on like that. ""You girls know, I might not be here tomorrow."" ""Now Nana, you know the deal, you're not going anywhere until I'm done with school.""

Before she passed, I had the chance to tell her I had finished all my classes and that I had passed them all. The morning she died, she knew I was coming to visit to bring her the diploma that had arrived in the mail a few days earlier. The graduation was all just a formality any way. By the time the graduation arrived my family used it as a second opportunity to gather together not only to celebrate my accomplishment but to honor the matriarch who had held us all together for so many years.

Your grandfather was soooooo proud of you. So damn proud. He probably told everyone if he was the type who did that sort of thing. If you have a chance to walk for graduation, walk tall. If you don't, stand tall nonetheless.  

Oh and if you find yourself wanting to ask him for advice, just ask. Say it out loud maybe. Sometimes the answers are stuck in our head hidden away for later :)

LifeProTips,fk8qrdd,t1_fk8lz21,1583961118.0,"I def agree that there are very sensitive populations out there and any place that sees a high volume of people passing through (like restaurants) is best avoided by those and those in contact with them.

Also I saw your comment about your gloves being porous. That's crazy! I mean, I think I have seen something like that before but it was years ago. 

I also still feel that stores who make employees work sick is bad on the manager ... not on the industry ... and is still often a decision by the employee. We have a health department list of things that prevent people from being allowed to work and Norovirus is one of them. Legally we cannot make people work who have certain contagions.

I do get a little frustrated when claws come out at the industry for forcing sick people to work. A lot of us are working very hard to keep our stores as safe as possible. Not everyone has the ability to cook every meal at home. And we can't pay our staff if we have to close, so we want to keep our doors open as long as possible so they don't have to worry about how they are going to pay their bills. Generating hysteria around restaurants does not help with this sadly.

So I suppose in closing :) I am not in total disagreement with your premise that there are sick people working in restaurants. Or your statement that sensitive populations should avoid these environments. And I am sorry to hear of your personal working conditions. I don't think we will ever see any industry where sick people stay home 100% of the time ... even healthcare sadly. 

But if we stay vigilant hopefully we can help more people stay safe right now. Also, thanks for taking the time to have this conversation."
LifeProTips,fk8l8t3,t1_fk8guzc,1583958176.0,"congrats on your degree! it's a shame you aren't so concerned about your coworkers who count on their job to pay their bills though :(

as for ""their practices"" ... it is often the employee who chooses to work. this is often the case in many industries that do not offer paid sick days or who offer very few. 

There are teachers, nurses, pilots, politicians, delivery drivers ... all at work ... right now ... all sick. right now. Because they cannot afford to miss work. Not because their job forces them to come to work sick, but because they cannot afford to lose a day's wages.

Our issue is less about the vicious man making sick people work (mean restaurant owners!!) and more an inquiry into why we have an economy that drives a paycheck to paycheck life in all sectors of our workforce.

But again ... may you have a prosperous future."
LifeProTips,fk8fvmh,t3_fh2ha2,1583955274.0,"best way to be out of a job is to tell people to not use your industry. 

not saying you are wrong about people being sick in food service, but the same is true in most part time work regardless. I have employees who work second jobs in non-F&B hourly jobs ... and as part time employees they don't get paid sick days.

very few industries are ""safe"" by this logic."

It kinda reflects our ideas of cultural identity. While it is possible to be born in one heritage, if your upbringing is in an entirely different one, it is not unheard of to have very strong ties to that cultural group ... in some cases to the point of fighting for your beliefs.

bartenders,fixjl91,t1_fixhcdm,1582821534.0,"Bartending can def be exciting ... and a lot of physical work. Depending on the kind of place you are at. It can also be emotionally draining if you have a bad shift dealing with a bunch of drunk idiots or entitled patrons. It's not just shiny tins and tap handles.

Since you say your company promotes from within, get a feel for which manager is most supportive of you.

Also some places have age restrictions on certain positions so make sure these aren't a concern.

A lot of it boils down to timing ... do they need an extra server or bartender? If they don't, they are less likely to train you for the job, but if they are short staffed, you might get trained immediately.

You don't always have to serve first but a lot of restaurants make their employees serve first if they are moving them through the ranks. It helps build product knowledge and customer service skills.

At the end of the day remember, the stuff that frustrates you at the host stand could possibly frustrate you again in another position. Getting a handle on that now is important."
