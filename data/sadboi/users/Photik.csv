YangForPresidentHQ,feg60j7,t1_feg50k1,1579078573.0,"It is a single payer system but he isn't for making private insurance illegal. So it is a consumer choice. Since it is a consumer choice he is predicting that it would take more than a term for consumers to decide what the government is providing is better than what they are getting from private insurance and there would be competition from private insurance that the government would have to beat out in order to get the market dominance it needs to have the full effect.

""With a shift to significantly more people receiving their care through a public option, costs can also be controlled directly by setting prices provided for medical services. The best approach is highlighted by the top-ranked Cleveland Clinic. There, doctors are paid a flat salary instead of by a price-for-service model. This shift has led to a hospital where costs are visible and under control. Redundant tests are at a minimum, and physician turnover is much lower than at comparable hospitals."" --Andrew Yang
https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medicare-for-all/

So the government will essentially set up an option that prices out all of it's competitors and once it has enough customers will then begin the process reforming the for profit models in hospitals that are bloated by their interplay with private insurance. To price out the competitors the government will take a hit and loose money with goal of getting the market share and then having the power to negotiate for social good all of the things private insurance negotiates now for profit. This might seem like a round about way to do this, but it will set up the health care system to stay dynamic and strong over time which I will start to explain in more detail in a couple of paragraphs.

If you look at the Canadian and British systems, which are models for a single payer systems world wide, they still have a private options. Actually if you look at it all countries that have universal health care have private options.

Please don't get confused by the hard core socialists who insist that there is a purity test for single payer system that means making private insurance illegal and having the government take over everything. That is a false statement and dangerous ideology to start trying to pander to and going 100% government healthcare probably isn't a great idea.

There is an important work in economics related to checks and balances that describes why complete government take overs are problematic, called the economic calculation problem.

""In the 1920 paper, Mises argued that the pricing systems in socialist economies were necessarily deficient because if a public entity owned all the means of production, no rational prices could be obtained for capital goods as they were merely internal transfers of goods and not ""objects of exchange"", unlike final goods. Therefore, they were unpriced and hence the system would be necessarily irrational, as the central planners would not know how to allocate the available resources efficiently.""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem?fbclid=IwAR3kz20Kf8HRjAlFg2VnMgmElt-LfqL298d7H_C6CXzseDjKpkaR6OZMwcU)

Historically the reason why communist governments failed in the 20th century economically is because they didn't consider the economic calculation problem. The power of the government they had in spades. Government mandates they had completely. What they didn't have was markets. The ones that outlived that phase adopted capitalism and markets like China and Vietnam to get out of the regressive nature of total economic planning that was leaving their countries in poverty. North Korea never made that decision and look at how that turned out. Bottom line is there needs to be some private markets that compete with the government to establish the price of a good or service based on what consumers are willing to pay. That is checks and balances. This is why mixed economies with social goals are successful. Markets solve the economic calculation problem. Governments push for the social goal.

The government can step in a compete with the market and set the best price and vice versa. Eliminating competition makes the price unknown and decided upon by a committee's guessing as opposed to autonomous people budgeting their own money. In a mixed system the government will always have the power to set fair baseline level of coverage but there will be price pressure from above to make sure that the government stays fair and efficient over time.

Generally most of us agree monopolies are a bad thing. A monopoly will charge whatever they like and people will have to pay it. A monopoly will control the price of the raw materials and labor for the product and they will have to submit to it. A monopoly will only provide the products they think are good, not the products the customers think are good. Replace a monopoly with the government and it has the same effect if the government takes total control of a market. Allowing private insurance to exist solves the economic calculation problem and also is a check on the governments power.

I believe in universal health care, if you look at what other countries are doing, none of them have been completely taken over by the government. They are all mixed systems. That isn't an accident, it's rational. We shouldn't just flip from one irrational system with no public option to another irrational system with no private option. The reason health insurance markets are dysfunctional is because there are no checks and balances for a product that is literally life or death. The social goals of the health care system have to co-exist with the price goals for it to stay rational.

YangForPresidentHQ,feg5vci,t3_eoxpjc,1579078370.0,"Bernie has solutions that maybe would have been better implemented 30-40 years ago. He's stuck in the mindset of everything that's been wrong with the government through his entire life, which is not to say his ideas to fix these problems don't have merit, BUT

Yang is not only putting forward solutions to fix those same old problems, but also the new problems that are coming (millions of Americans being displaced from work due to automation), as well as seeing an imbalance in the economy that no one else is addressing: the likes of Google and Amazon not really paying taxes, but having most of the wealth.

Yang isn't targeting the 1% per se, he's not villianizing the rich the way Bernie and Warren are, he's not punishing people for being successful; he IS proposing to implement solutions that even the field while giving a little something back to everyone- 1% included.

UBI helps alleviate so many problems its actually a bit mind boggling how its not been put into practice sooner. And it helps tens of dozens of issues while removing tons of red tape because it isn't means tested. That to me is the biggest thing. Its simple and effective on so many fronts.

Whereas back on Bernie's side the FJG or minimum wage increase puts more red tape, and does nothing to improve the lives of the disabled, elderly, self employed, stay at home parents/ caregivers, or students who would better spend their time on schoolwork. In addition, FJG and $15 minimum wage would only cause small businesses to have to fire employees or give them less hours at the very least, as well as speed up automation in various fields such as clerical & accounting, fast food & retail, and call center jobs."
