suspiciouslyspecific,fr1m0bt,t1_fqzvda8,1589822050.0,"I‚Äôm not OP, but quarantine has inspired me to perfect my recipe. 


Lasagna
1lb ground beef (80/20)
1 package hot Italian sausage (about 1lb) (I like premio brand or whatever is behind the butcher counter at the grocery store. I try to avoid brands that come frozen.)
1 tbsp minced garlic
Black pepper
Salt
Garlic powder
Fennel seed
Oregano
Basil
Crushed red pepper flakes
14oz can crushed tomatoes
14oz can petite diced tomatoes
Optional: 1 tiny (4oz?) can plain tomato sauce

Lasagna noodles, probably not a whole 1lb package but have that much just to be safe

28oz tub full fat ricotta
8oz of the driest, oldest white cheddar you can find, or a 50/50 blend of white cheddar and parmesan, shredded (I use Cabot Mad River Reserve, but that is really hard to find) (DO NOT USE THE GREEN CAN OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN. I‚Äôd rather you use regular yellow cheddar than green can.)
2lb bag shredded mozzarella (part-skim is ok) (You probably don‚Äôt need the whole bag, but you need more than 1lb)
 
Remove the Italian sausage from its casings. Heat a wide, shallow pan (NOT NONSTICK) on mediumish heat until water droplets sizzle when they hit the pan. If the droplets look like they‚Äôre ice skating, it‚Äôs too hot! Lift up the pan off the burner for a minute or so, turn the heat down, and try again. 

Put the sausage and ground beef in the pan so that they are a flat layer covering the whole bottom. Sprinkle evenly with black pepper, 1tsp salt (ish, to taste), 2tsp each red pepper flakes, dried oregano, dried basil, and a pinch of fennel. You can skip the fennel if you need to. Cook the sausage and ground beef, alternating between 1 minute periods stirring/breaking up clumps and letting the bottom layer really brown, until most of the meat is a very deep mahogany brown color. At this point, open your cans of tomatoes but do not use them yet. The clumps of meat should be small, like pea-sized or smaller, and if you look at them they should seem like they‚Äôre probably too well done. 

Move all the meat to the edges of the pan, and dump your minced garlic into the bare pan. There should be browned bits stuck to the pan, and hopefully some grease from the meat, in which you can lightly soften and brown the garlic. As soon as you smell it start to get toasty, dump in the petite diced tomatoes. Stir everything all together for about 30 seconds, then add in the crushed tomatoes. Turn the heat to your stove‚Äôs lowest setting. After about 5 minutes, taste and decide if it needs more of any of the seasonings. You can be pretty aggressive with black pepper, basil, and oregano, but don‚Äôt go overboard with salt, red pepper flakes, or fennel. You can also add some garlic powder at this point if you want to increase the garlic pungency, but we will also be adding garlic powder to another component, so keep that in mind. 

Mix the ricotta in a bowl with about half the white cheddar (or cheddar/Parmesan blend), a pinch of salt and pepper, 1tbsp of garlic powder, and dried or chopped fresh parsley if you want. 

I like to boil my noodles in shifts, but it‚Äôs up to you. Either way, boil a large pot of well-salted but not oiled water. While waiting for it to boil, grease the sides of a 13x9 baking pan. In the bottom, either put the 4oz can of tomato sauce or, if you‚Äôre not using that, some of the liquid only from your tomato sauce that‚Äôs keeping warm on the other burner. If you‚Äôre boiling noodles in batches, put in 4-5 noodles, otherwise dump them all in, using tongs to turn/soften/stir so they‚Äôre submerged and not sticking. When they‚Äôre done according to package directions, use tongs to remove them to a strainer or silpat. Normally I might want noodles underdone if I‚Äôm baking, but since the meat sauce doesn‚Äôt have very much liquid, I‚Äôm not doing that here. If you cooked all the noodles, you may need to put a thin film of cooking oil or spray on them to keep them from sticking to each other if you stack them while you‚Äôre waiting to build your lasagna. If you didn‚Äôt, as soon as you remove the first noodles, start your second batch and start building your lasagna in the pan. 

Layer 1: noodles. If you don‚Äôt cover the full length of the pan, you can cut the noodles with kitchen shears to get shorter pieces to go at the ends or sides. Just make sure if you do that you leave a little overlap and alternate the placement of the scraps on the next set of layers. 
Layer 2: smear noodles with 1/3 of the ricotta mixture
Layer 3: 1/3 sauce, spread evenly
Layer 4: about 1/3 mozzarella, or to nicely cover the top of the sauce

You should get about 3 sets of layers. After the last mozzarella, sprinkle the remaining white cheddar evenly over the top. You can also add some oregano for color. Bake at 350F with a sheet pan underneath to catch drips for about an hour, or until the top has nice brown cheese at least in the corners and some spots elsewhere. That temperature is adjustable by 25 degrees in either direction if you‚Äôre baking other things, though if you go lower you may not get the browning you‚Äôre looking for. 

Let the lasagna rest. Ideally 15 minutes, but at least 5. For nicest serving, cut slices with a knife before removing from the pan."
