My boyfriend looked like a whole boiled potato in highschool. Now he has a beard and has filled out he is the most attractive person to me. He had really bad skin when I met him and he uses my skin products that have genuinely helped. 

Looking after your skin is important, but it won't fix your face or your insecurities. You will grow into your body don't worry, and please please remember that those people online are very fake, most have makeup on and have filters etc. What you need to do is find what makes YOU attractive and accentuate it. It will take a while to love yourself, but it's important to do. If you don't love yourself how the hell are you going to love somebody else? 

Don't worry about your height, just eat healthy and exercise when you can (for your mental and physical health) you'll either grow or you won't. And if you don't get tall don't worry. I'm a 5""8 girl who would happily date someone shorter than me and have done so in the past, lots of people are like that, don't hate those with tastes that don't match how you look. Everyone likes different things and find different things attractive

You are so young, don't beat yourself up. You have lots of time to grow and mature as a person. 

My main advice is:

Look after your mental health, eat healthy, exercise (even just a little) and look after your skin (don't go crazy on those products, just a cleanser and moisturizer is good) when you look in the mirror instead of thinking about how to change things you don't like, try to compliment the things you do like.

I believe at you! Be kind to yourself :)

And I am sick of all the ""wow you are so skinny!"" ""You  are such a stick!""

I was really disappointed because I hate the waste created by pads and tampons, I wanted a more environmentally sustainable option. At this point I'm going to try period underwear.

My friend also can't use a diva cup because she has a low cervix and the cup really hurts her, she even tried a cup made for girls with a low cervix and it didn't work out.

Vaginas are all different, even if you don't have a condition and yours is just shaped a little different it can make the diva cup impossible to use"
rant,fpkep2x,t3_gdtmue,1588693323.0,"When I was 8 I heard about the name Hitler, I asked who that was and my uncle said ""a bad man"" 

I was 13 and asked my teacher who Hitler was because I didn't know. I was told ""a very bad man"" and he would not say more. 

I was 15 when I asked my highschool history teacher who Hitler was. She told me if I brought it up I would get detention. And said ""it's nothing to concern a young girl with, he was a bad man""

When I was 16 a different history teacher finally taught us who Hitler was because the education system forced her. 

I was absolutely fascinated by the information given to me. I obviously didn't agree with the nazis, I obviously thought what they did to people was disgusting and fucked up. But I just found the absolute dystopian way they lived incredibly interesting. It was like peering through a looking class and seeing an alternate dimension that was wrong, but it happened in our world. I was particularly interested in all the youth camps and brain washing they did. It was just so amazing to me that this happened at all, it seemed so alien. That type of curiosity and fascination was not born due to mental illness or that I agreed with what happened. It was born because my whole childhood no one wanted me to know who Hitler was, what the second world war was about. It was born because it seemed so unrealistic that such things even occured. It was like it was straight out one of my young adult dystopian fantasy books. It was just so hard for me to comprehend that something like that could happen and I was shocked to find it had, so I wanted to learn as much as possible. 

This kid probably feels the same. History repeats itself, it's better we are all properly educated on the past good and bad so we can stop it. Ignorance only allows bad things to repeat."

relationship_advice,fpizexi,t3_gdiewe,1588652458.0,"One of the first times I slept with my boyfriend he had a cut on his penis, he got hard (because sexy times) and unfortunately he bled all over my white sheets by accident. I took my sheets and washed them for him because I knew he was embarrassed.

Every month when I bleed through my pad and ruin the sheets he will take the sheets and bloody things and wash them, change the sheets on the bed and bring me chocolate, a hot water bottle and paracetamol, to top it off he gives hugs as well. Why? Because he knows I don't feel great during my period and he does these things to make me feel better.

I clean up after him when he is sick, I wash and change his puke bucket when he is bed ridden with a stomach bug, I clean up anything he pukes on and he does the same for me. One night I got so drunk he put me over the toilet and put his fingers down my throat just to force me to throw up so I wouldn't get alcohol poisoning, he held my hair too. 

Being part of a relationship is compromise and working together. Loving each other enough to do gross things for each other just to make the other person more comfortable when they aren't feeling great.

Your boyfriend sounds very childish and frankly like he needs to grow up before being in a relationship with someone else. Acting like you are dirty because you are on your period? That's down right misogynistic. I say find yourself someone that would help you clean up the blood and bring you a block of chocolate and hugs after, no judgement just love. Periods are normal, leaking at night is normal. A boyfriend who acts like you are dirty for being on your period? Well let's say he's proudly waving the biggest red flag I've ever seen."

The other two girls were the short hair tomboyish types, but I've always dressed in clothes that make me feel pretty and sexy. So I was wearing fishnets with a split knitted dress over the top with black boot heels (twas cute af), for some reason what I wore was reason enough to not let me play. We were watching these guys play COD and they wouldn't let me join. I kept asking but they just wouldn't. They said it would be too easy to beat me and there would be no point. I was getting shitty and they finally gave me a controller after another dude interjected and said I should have a turn. Now I played A LOT of cod because it was the only multiplayer game I had on PS3, so my sister and I are pretty good because it's what we would play when we both wanted to play the PlayStation.

I. Fucking. Smashed. Them. I literally died once, probably the best I've ever done tbh.

After giving me shit on how much I would suck what do you think they did when I beat their arses to a pulp? They fucking gave me shit, swore at me and quit, they said I was a loser for being so good at cod. 

I posted this story a while back on Reddit and someone ""that happened"" me like I made it up. For fucks sake I can't even tell guys what happened because they don't believe me.

I know how much it sucks when sentimental jewellery breaks, I have my great grandmothers opal ring, she was a cheap lady so she bought a very cheap opal ring from coober pedy. After she died of throat cancer (fuck cancer) her ring was given to me, I wore it every single day. One day in highschool it just shattered when I was tapping my fingers against a desk. It's completely broken. The metal was cheap and so was the opal, turned out to be a triplet opal, the opal had shattered and the metal. So my plan was to go to coober pedy, find an opal (no matter how long it takes), cut it myself and completely re-make the ring using gold. For me just having that same design and knowing I went and found my own opal in the place she went will be very worth it. Even though no part of the new ring will be from the original ring the design will be the same and it will make me feel close to her again. This pandemic messed me up to, I'll have to wait until next year to go to coober pedy now. Hopefully you can get your ring fixed soon. Best of luck!!"

I'm currently doing a diploma of jewellery design in Australia and am thinking of doing gemology next year as it interests me. I'd really like to learn how to cut gems. Do you have any tips on starting out?"
jewelrymaking,fnh0zak,t3_fuvxnv,1586951813.0,"The way I protect my plated jewellery is to coat it in clear nail polish which honestly works fine, you could use a special coating which is probably better than nail polish, I generally don't care much for my plated jewellery as I hate the way it looks when it fades from wear, or how it can sometimes make your fingers green if brass or copper was used as a base. If you don't want to coat it you'll have to get it plated again every few years by a professional."
jewelrymaking,fngzkd5,t3_fwkt4i,1586950554.0,"I'll tell you right now that that torch will not be good for precise soldering or soldering bigger pieces depending on what you are making, the double flame will make things difficult. 

If you are wanting something that will last and be good for small and big projects I would highly recommend the smiths little torch. It is however quite expensive to set up and requires you buy an oxygen and propane tank as well as set it up with regulators and spark arrestors.

I would suggest getting a torch with just one flame as you'll have more control. I went from using a small butane torch to the smiths little torch in uni (doing a diploma of Jewellery design) and I can't go back. Every issue I had with soldering (namely solder not flowing) I never had with the little torch. 

Just keep in mind compact torches sometimes cannot deliver the right amount of heat or even the same heat fast enough and it leads to lots of soldering issues. I have gone through 3 different types of compact torches and they all broke and were unusable after only a few weeks of use. 

If you absolutely have to use a compact torch make sure it burns VERY hot and has a single precise flame, you may need to spend more than $20 to find something like that of good quality that won't break after being used."

You would have your pattern embroidered on a piece of fabric, you then wrap the fabric around the cabochon and glue the back of the cabochon so the wrapped excess fabrics sticks. Make sure the fabric sits tight and flat against the back of the cabochon. You then glue the cabochon into the setting, most likely with epoxy glue or something strong and clear. Make sure you don't put glue where it is visible. 

I hope this helps!"

relationship_advice,fn2aijo,t1_fn217kp,1586582572.0,"I can't have a biological child either. And I think it's shitty that people refuse to adopt, like you said these kids go though shit and they deserve love. If you've run out of options and you are desperate to have a child I think you should at least try. I find a lot of people refuse to adopt not because of the difficulty (which I am aware of due to watching the legal battle between family friends and the drug addict biological mother of their two foster children) but because of the mentality that since it's not biologically theirs it's not ""special"" or really ""theirs"" 

In my opinion if you are that desperate for a child it's worth the effort and money to put a kid in a good home. Yes it comes with difficulties. Yes its hard. But that's the hand you've been dealt. I see so many women have melt downs over this, I've even heard some say they refuse to adopt because they don't want to pay for someone else's child.

And personally when I do become a foster mother I won't care of the age. I wasn't in the best situation as a child and I don't want anyone to go through similar stuff. You bet your ass I'm going to do everything in my power to help a child heal and be loved and well looked after with me. And if they have siblings? I don't care. They will find a home with me, I won't separate them. I know the hand I've been dealt in life. I'm not going to try and have a biological child through a surrogate because frankly my genetic issues are not something that should be forced upon a child. I do not feel destroyed or sad about this, because at the end of the day I know I will be helping someone who needs it."
relationship_advice,fn21sj4,t3_fyhek9,1586575600.0,"This kind of hostility towards your son will result in a bad relationship between your boyfriend and your kids which in turn may affect your relationship with your children.

I plan to adopt a child when I am older and more financially stable (and I plan to be single) if for some reason someone manages to steal my heart and I want to be with them, how they treat my child will be the deciding factor. If you are going into a relationship with children you have to be prepared to love them like your own. The fact your boyfriend isn't is a red flag in my eyes. 

Good on you for putting your children first. I know so many people who don't do that, including my own mother."
relationship_advice,fn217wl,t3_fyectx,1586575180.0,"Clearly it's about trust, and seeing how your wife blew up at your daughter about the condom she obviously won't want to share any information with her. 

When I was that age the reason I told my mother everything was because she told me I could and that she would never be mad at me, she just wanted to know I was safe. So I told her when I lost my virginity, she told me ""gross, but thank you for letting me know, be safe"" 

Parents who berate their children for growing up will never have the trust of their child. I have a friend who is 21 and her mother still believes she is a virgin when in fact she goes to orgys regularly, she never told her mother when she got her period either. Why? Because she does not trust her mother due to the way she has reacted in the past. 

Your wife needs to learn this. Your daughter is growing up and will be sexually active no matter what your mother says. We were all teenagers, she needs to be accepting if she wants a close relationship with your daughter.

Be there for your daughter, don't distance yourself from her just to please your wife because it will damage your relationship with your daughter, you seem like a really good dad so keep it up!!"
relationship_advice,fn201g2,t3_fygql7,1586574325.0,"Can I just say that I think the pedestal people put  having biological children on is shitty. Why not just adopt? There are so many kids out there in shitty foster homes being mistreated and without love. They deserve a good home, and it disgusts me that people will go ""I can't have a biological child, that means I will never have a child"" or they try and force people like you to give birth for them. Are they even offering you any money? Most surrogates get paid a fortune to be a surrogate. 

It's your body and your life. Don't have this kid if you don't want to, they have no right to pressure you. I'm glad you stood up for yourself."
