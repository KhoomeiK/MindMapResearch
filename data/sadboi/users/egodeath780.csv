This is such a disgrace. In a normal world, Donald Trump \*never\* should've been considered a viable choice as president, with all of the shit he's been tied up in (financial scandals, sexual misconduct, etc.) prior to being elected -starting in the 80's. But here we are, and going to the closest normal after that: he NEVER should've been allowed to go on as president; when it was found out he cheated in the election with Russian help, setup a network of lackeys within his own campaign to further said help, and by stirring discord/conning morons on FB via Cambridge Analytica. I can't believe my eyes when I see people arguing anything against this, with all the reports confirming his guilt: i.e. the Mueller Report, Senate Intel report, Crossfire Hurricane, & the OIG Investigation that oversaw the ladder. What's really fucking astounding is I've only scratched the fucking surface of how much this president has done to be removed. He shouldn't of been allowed to stay on as president- He should've been removed from office and thoroughly investigated. Remember all the senators that allowed this to happen. This has set a dangerous precedent that presidents are above the rule of law, and that seems to be his forte. When this get's worse, (which it will the closer we get to election time) remember these people had a choice to remove... but allowed this shitshow to go on:

The policy, which acknowledges that exposure to high levels of perchlorate can cause I.Q. damage but opts nevertheless not to limit it, could also set a precedent for the regulation of other chemicals, people familiar with the matter said."

It's worse than that: much worse.

There's a hell of a difference between the parties.

All 3 times the Republicans had complete control of government in the last 100 years, Senate, Congress and President, for over 4 years, it has resulted in the greatest financial collapses in the last 100 years.

Don't think so?

1. **The Panic of 1907**â¦â¦ [Markets fell over 43% before bottoming out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907)).....Complete GOP control from 1901 to 1913


2. **The Great Depression, 1929**..... fueled by the unsustainable laissez-faire (unregulated) polices of the roaring 20âs......Complete GOP control from 1921 to 1933


3. **The Financial crisis of 2007-2008**....Complete GOP control from 2001 to 2007

[Check it out here if you don't believe it (Wikipedia divisions of US government).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses)

While you're checking Wikipedia, notice what happened between 1933 and 1995 when the Democrats had complete control of the Congress and the Senate for all but 2 years.....What happened?

America created **the largest most prosperous middle Class the world had every seen**...inequality was at an all time low and wages were at an all time high.

It wasn't until 1995 When the Gingrich Republicans took over congress for the first time in over 60 years (with his contract ~~with~~ On America) that inequality started to skyrocket and the American standard of living began to sink.

Vote blue no matter who..in *every* election."
