I've been watching my brother play through it the past few weeks and I've played through about 2/3s of it myself and we both agree it isn't that great of a 'game' in the sense of actual gameplay mechanics and how it plays. You can't deny it's a fantastic looking game, even 4 years later as well as narratively solid, but it's lacking in most other areas"
PS4,fq8w1qv,t3_ghbr5k,1589177196.0,"Honestly, I find this entry in the series to be kinda overrated. Narratively and technically it's outstanding. But it's far too long and the tired old gameplay loop gets boring kinda fast. They don't really switch up the game mechanics much the entire game and the stealth sections are hilariously bad."

rugbyunion,fmmx624,t1_fmmwkgp,1586213782.0,I think you're definitely right with the home jersey perhaps needing more of the accent black. I had that thought a few times while designing it but could never quite figure out where to include some more black accents or how to approach it. I may revisit at some point and see if I can't come up with something. It's definitely part of the reason I prefer the away concept more

I know the NZ super rugby teams did it one season, I think it was '09 and I was a big fan, but this is also coming from a fan of the NFL where its common place. I think people tend to be opposed to it because rugby is such a team game and having your name on your jersey is viewed as individualistic/egocentric, but it never bothered me."

Yeah to be honest I felt the same way, as much as I respect how much Maori heritage means to the Chiefs and how sweet some of the designs have been, I wanted to try something different that differentiated itself a bit. 

I liked this pattern in particular because it reminded me of like a modern geometric take on a feather sort of pattern, and I envisioned the Maori chiefs with their feather cloaks, so I thought that was a neat idea. 

I've actually already done a Blues one, it's my previous post before this one! Think I'll definitely try the Canes next though :)"
