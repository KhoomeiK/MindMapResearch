Some people find they can manage the episodes using things like diet, exercise, meditation and simply accepting the consequences but for the vast majority of us medication is not so much a choice but a necessity . I highly recommend you ask to see a psychiatrist if possible as that way you can be re-evaluated and if needed hopefully be a little more successful finding the right meds (the right meds make all the difference).

I think the injections were recommended because I‚Äôm having issues with my pancreas and issues with my small intestines that are causing malabsorption for the last 2 years.

I had a couple more ideas that have been given to me over the years. One is if you feel the immediate uncontrollable urge (for me it‚Äôs triggered by frustration/anger that turns into anxiety) to fill the sink with cold water the submerge you‚Äôre face for as long as you can. It was explained to me that this triggers a physiological response (something to do with the vagus nerve) and can stop/slow down the anxiety. Another idea is to take a bowl full of ice cubes then take them outside and throw them as hard as you possibly can at a wall (sounds silly but I find this really helps). Do you like colouring or puzzles ? Could you arrange with your husband so you get specific time periods during the week where everyone knows to just let you be to relax and if the kids need anything they will go to him. Like say M, W, F 7:00-9:00pm where that is your time to take care of you, however that looks like (colouring, puzzles, bath, shower, crochet, needlepoint, etc). The best thing that helped me may not be an option but I‚Äôll put it out there. My cat is the best at getting me to calm down long enough to stop the urge and just settle down. She shows up when I‚Äôm upset and just sits on my lap and purrs, I don‚Äôt know why but it works almost every time. I really hope you can find something that works for you.

You are doing a really hard job taking care of2 young children, nursing (that sure as hell isnt easy), you‚Äôre probably doing the cooking and cleaning, errands, keeping the kids schedule, etc. Being a SAHM is really hard work but there is no formal way of recognizing all the work you do.

AmItheAsshole,fmewq1x,t3_fuvjgh,1586015180.0,"YTA. While your intentions were initially good, your execution was awful. Would you have even batted an eye if she had been white? No one likes to admit their actions were based on racism, especially when it‚Äôs not something we are conscious about. Take this as an opportunity to change. Be conscious of stereotypes and your own attitudes. Accept that you used your privilege as a white man to not only stop and question this woman and the child she was caring but you detained them without any proof other than a feeling (based on racial bias). Reflect on your actions and learn from them. Do better."
AmItheAsshole,fmbxpaf,t3_fuc7ss,1585935130.0,"YTA, I can‚Äôt believe someone could be both this clueless and this entitled. How would you feel if she gave away your family heirloom because you ‚Äúweren‚Äôt using it‚Äù. Or perhaps a gaming system you haven‚Äôt played in a month because she wanted the money and you weren‚Äôt using it, besides, what‚Äôs yours is hers right?you gave it to your sister because you wanted to make her happy, that was a good thing, but you gave away someone else‚Äôs property that you had no claim to. Have you spoken to your gf about what it means to her, why it‚Äôs so special. That would be a good start so you can have a better understanding of why what you did was so wrong. Use this experience to grow as a person. Admit what you did was wrong. Call your sister and apologize, explain that you never had permission to give that to her and that you will make it up to her. Apologize to your gf, talk to her about what you have learned from this and use it to better understand the things that are important to her."
mentalhealth,fmbslt0,t3_fubksu,1585932456.0,"Text them and tell them that. Give them time to respond, it can be really hard to when your mental health in in the pits, but messages of support can help. If they dont respond by tomorrow try again. Keep it simple and low pressure, that you‚Äôre there if they want to talk and if she takes you up on it just listen. This may not be something you can fix but listening without judgement can be very helpful. If you feel they are considering hurting themselves consider making a safety plan with them ex. If they are having thought of suicide they will do: 1. Call you to talk, if that doesn‚Äôt help then 2. Call a crisis line (have the numbers for her already) etc.."

I‚Äôm going to follow your advice about a mood tracking app, I agree it might help. I‚Äôm also going to double down on my efforts to find a psychiatrist who will take me on as a patient. Thank you."
BipolarReddit,fm9fen3,t3_ftuy5m,1585867618.0,"I don‚Äôt know if this will help but I hear you and I feel you. I‚Äôm so sorry you are going through this, please try to remember it can get better with time. I have never had much help at the hospital but I did get help from a crisis line this week. Somehow they managed to get me a virtual appointment with a psychiatrist in less than a week. I don‚Äôt know where this will lead but it‚Äôs the most progress I‚Äôve made in seeing a psychiatrist in 2 years. Would you consider calling a local crisis line in your area. Please don‚Äôt worry if you are not in crisis the moment you call, it doesn‚Äôt matter, your call matters. I have a friend who is an icu nurse and she said they are supposed to get everyone out of the er as fast as possible and do everything they can not to admit patients unless absolutely necessary. Emergency departments are not good for psych patients on a good day let alone in a pandemic. Regardless of that you are important and they should not have let you leave. Please reach out to any and all supports you can. You are important and you matter."
Odsp,flxk9o9,t3_frswvj,1585584534.0,"Because we don‚Äôt matter. I had to stop reading Facebook news posts because there were people calling for anyone on odsp to not get a respirator if we get sick because we contribute nothing to society. On landlord and tenant groups there are calls for landlords to kick the leaches on ow/odsp out right now because the police are busy with other things, and there were people saying call their caseworkers and lie to get them kicked off if they refuse to accept an illegal rent increase. The comments over and over about how we contribute nothing to society and are greedy by asking for more help right now. People hate us and I don‚Äôt understand why? Call me naive if you want but I don‚Äôt understand why our lives are worth so little. None of us asked to be disabled and a lot of us work as much as possible as we become sicker and sicker trying to survive."

mentalhealth,flul70j,t3_fr8xpf,1585504837.0,"I have been having similar issues. Getting no where with referrals for over a year, not able to get help from a gp because my case is too complicated for them, then being told they can do nothing now until covid 19 has passed. I was so frustrated because I know my meds aren‚Äôt working and every day I get worse. I finally contacted a crisis line and they have been able to connect me with a psychiatrist for a virtual appointment next Friday. It‚Äôs not perfect but at least it gives me a place to start. I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre located but perhaps contact a local crisis line, explain it‚Äôs not a crisis yet but could become one and that you are desperately trying to see a psychiatrist; they may be able to help.

Edit: sorry, reread that you are needing a psychologist not a psychiatrist. My suggestion still stands as they may also have resources to connect you with a psychologist or social worker."

Medications are always a trade off between costs(including side effects)  and benefits, only you and your doctor can determine what is best for you. If you are currently taking this medication please please please do not stop taking it without speaking to your doctor and gradually reduce the dosage. please do not just abruptly stop taking it."

We live within a system that has us living on the edge of destitution every month. We have no opportunity to save for emergencies and when one hits we are significantly affected. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt want people who have lost their jobs to receive the money they need to keep afloat, of course they should get it. It‚Äôs that through all this everyone keeps saying that everyone needs help except for us as we already ‚Äúget too much‚Äù. I had to choose this week between paying for my meds (not covered) or buying food. I chose my meds. I also appreciate that we are not the only ones making these choices, but our options are extremely limited. Since we can‚Äôt work or only work limited hours we seem to hold no value in societies eyes, we are nothing but a drain on the system, but I disagree. I have yet to meet someone on odsp who just wants to collect their money and do nothing. Everyone I have met either works as much as they can, attends school so they can find work they can do or volunteers with the little energy they do have. We do contribute, just in different ways. All life has value and we shouldn‚Äôt be left behind because we physically can‚Äôt work full time."
disability,floy8dr,t3_fq5143,1585347909.0,"So, I‚Äôm in Canada and I take this medication. I have been on it for 8 years. I always get 3 months at a time but they are only filling 1 months max now due to supply issues. Last year I had to stop for 6 months due to health issues and the damage done to my joints in that time period is very noticeable. The alternative medications seem to be either methotrexate which I already take or biologics that I can‚Äôt afford. If this works against covid19 I will give up my meds but please don‚Äôt ask me to until we know. This is not as simple as just stopping or changing to something else. This will cause a significant increase in symptoms (what most people call ‚Äúa flare up‚Äù) which will cause both significant physical pain but also will cause me to break out in psoriasis all over. Then I think about the people with lupus who take this and they have so much more to worry about than just joint damage and skin rashes. Please, this is affecting more than just the US. Please don‚Äôt take our medications away until you know that it works!"

BipolarReddit,fli2tuh,t1_flhxmih,1585174242.0,"I consider myself a fairly self aware person, I‚Äôm constantly trying to evaluate my mood and stability. I can tell when I‚Äôm depressed, severely depressed or stable but for some reason I can not tell when I‚Äôm hypo manic or manic until the swing shifts. I take my meds every day at the same time every day, I watch everything I eat, I make sure I keep an exercise regime, I track my mood, I try to do everything I can but they still happen and I still can‚Äôt tell until after! I can tell a manic/hypo manic episode was coming by putting the pieces together after but not before, however a depressed period I can usually see coming unless it is the result of a huge swing from one side to another. My heart breaks for anyone who supports someone like me. Please know that the support of others is what keeps me going but I feel awful for every outburst and swing. Your support likely means everything to your person but make sure to take care of yourself too. You can‚Äôt help anyone if you‚Äôre not okay."

The nurses and doctors do not work there for free, the supplies they use are not free, rent and utilities are not free, they have lots of expenses that cost money. Given the number of people who are losing their jobs and their health insurance more and more people will need to go to planned parenthood for their services as they can‚Äôt afford to go anywhere else. Pregnant women needing prenatal care, woman who need access to safe birth control, etc. So planned parenthood sees an increased number of patients for all sorts of services which means increased expenses which leads to losing more money."

If we weren‚Äôt in the middle of a pandemic I would suggest couples counselling to explore why he doesn‚Äôt want to pursue more meds, whether that is really rational given the situation and what would support him during the transition.

‚ÄúTORONTO ‚Äî The Ontario government is providing $200 million in social services relief funding to help protect the health and safety of the province's most vulnerable people in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe funding will help municipalities and social service providers such as shelters, food banks, emergency services, charities and non-profits continue to deliver their critical services, hire additional staff, and find ways to promote social distancing and self-isolation to keep clients safe and healthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe government is putting in place an expanded Emergency Assistance program administered through Ontario Works (OW) to cover these individuals' needs such as food, rent, informal childcare, and services. There will also be discretionary benefits available to those who already receive social assistance.‚Äù

I definitely would not recommend using it until you are several years out due to issues with over eating as well as transfer addiction. That being said I do consume it as an oil and vape it daily now. It has helped me immensely with sleep and pain management. I plan my daily calorie consumption assuming I will eat after vaping. I allocate 400 calories for that and I make sure I have easily accessible healthy comfort foods so I don‚Äôt eat things I shouldn‚Äôt (things like cut up fruit, egg salad for wraps, frozen grapes, etc).

Psychiatry,fl0hhg2,t1_fkrtjs2,1584706568.0,"I agree with this so much and your doctor sounds amazing. My doctor sat me down after my last trip to the er and told me never to put my psych diagnosis on the history form again. It turns out I had bacterial colitis but I was not tested or treated until my third trip to the er trying to get help. I was accused of drug seeking twice (twice!) when I never once asked for meds, I just needed the diarrhea to stop. I needed help as I was passing out and could not eat or drink anything. I lost 30 lbs in 6 weeks and could barely stand. I‚Äôll continue to put all my meds down but as soon as they heard my diagnosis the way I was treated completely changed and it had disastrous effects for me. I lost my job and had to temporarily drop out of school for 2 semesters and am still only back part time. My gp finally put me on a strong round of antibiotics but it took months for the worst of the symptoms to pass and I ended up living with the symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency for 20 months before I was able to get someone to take me seriously. I want faking, I wasn‚Äôt drug seeking, I wasn‚Äôt lying, I wasn‚Äôt seeking attention...I needed help. This was not the first time my diagnosis and treatment were significantly delayed because of my psych diagnosis, symptoms attributed to anxiety, or simply been told that my diagnosis means I‚Äôm a liar and a drug addict (I‚Äôm not, I don‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm not violent, I don‚Äôt even drink let alone do any drugs or abuse any of my medications). Please don‚Äôt misunderstand, I do not think any of the doctors I saw were ‚Äúbad doctors‚Äù, I‚Äôm sure they are very good and help many people, but I do think some doctors are blinded by a psych diagnosis and it would be helpful to be aware of that bias."
