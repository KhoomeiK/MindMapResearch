Anxiety,fl62q58,t3_fmu45j,1584852568.0,"First. Read the virus subreddit thread for facts. Educate yourself. Then. And only then. Make a danger assessment. 
If you arent spreading fluids. You wont get them sick. Let me know if this helps any. 
Sorry if this comes off rather strict. Im so sick of the virus hysteria. 
Ive survived much worse illnesses i had no immunity to and one that suppressed mine at a young age. Without hospitalization. This one just doesnt seem to matter. But that is my opinion not a fact. 

In all honesty. You stressing will cause more illness to come forward than the virus. Freaking out and sweating can suppress your immune response if you get in contact with bacteria.

As for relief. Thats my forte!! Music is my escape. Sex is a short term bodily reset. And if all else fails. Acute pain therapy helps. Especially for shaking sweating and night terror related problems. 

My steps. 1: eat proper, bathe slow and with cool water or warm if its more relaxing. 2: excercise virgorously alone and then repeat step 1. 3: listen to a song that makes your hairstand on end and makes u feel nice not bad. Repeat it. I have many many suggestions for that type of method. 
4: do as you feel is comfy or secure. Like special clothes or jewelry etc. Hold on to what comforts you deeply.
