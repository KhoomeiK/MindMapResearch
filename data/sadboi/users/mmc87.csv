I don't wear it during the off-season so that's why it lasted. I really want a Johnson jersey but his' are never on sale so I'd have to pay full price.    

I really like the sweatshirt. It's has a jersey feeling. The sleeves have wide white stripes that make it look more jersey-like. It's not very warm though.

I moved to Portland last year and even here is not as cold as other northern cities I had to invest in a couple of items.

Some people have mentioned moving to a new place, that doesn't always work. I moved across the country and it turned out awful but I had no choice.

I'm not sure next season he's gonna be overlooked. I remember reading on the NHL website about guys should be in your radar, and Cirelli was one of them."

For me the problem is mostly lack of motivation and having a hard time concentrating.     

My counselor suggested to design a spot in my apartment for working (strongly recommended avoiding the couch). I've been working in my living room on my dining table (I don't have a desk since before this I did zero work at home).     

I'm a guy who likes routines so I made one. Wake up, take a shower, have my breakfast and start working. Taking short breaks helps. I take about an hour to cook/have my lunch and then I keep working a couple of hours. In the afternoon I just watch tv and play videogames. Having this routine of working in the early morning, having lunch around noon and working til 3 or 4 pm has worked. In that way I have the afternoons for myself. Also taking walks outside is really helpful."

Now we talk about how awesome their music is and listen to some tunes together.   

I even got a heart and skull tattoo. My friend has one too. Funny story, someone looked at our tattoos and asked me if I liked Trio's music before meeting my friend.

That changed last year when I moved to a new city. I've been struggling to find friends, I isolated myself and I ended up with depression.    
I'm pretty sure the people I worked with would never imagine I'm having a hard time and not really liking my current living situation.    
What I'm trying to say is that everything is relative. My coworkers would consider me successful, and I feel that way sometimes. Of course I have my mental health issues, which I try to alleviate with counseling and meds.    
It's impossible to avoid compare yourself to other people, I do it all the time. Some people can handle more pain, stress, you name it than others. Like my best friend, he has more serious issues than I do but rarely whines about it. Makes me feel my issues aren't real compared to his. He has told me that is not the case, though.

I was trying to escape from reality by being drunk. I was in a vicious cycle of feeling like shit on weekdays waiting for the weekend to drink, feeling like shit with the hangover and not really ready to do it all over again.   
Luckily things got better and I stopped drinking for about half a year. Then I started again but this time with a friend of mine and we would drink every other weekend.

AskMen,fjacbl9,t1_fja2lnf,1583170588.0,"Nice comment dude, thanks for sharing. I have a friend with mental health issues. He's one of my best friends but I'm not quite sure if I have helped him or not. Like you said, it's hard to deal with people with mental health problems. I kind of figured out what you're saying about thinking of being a burden, he had a rough time and stopped hanging out and replying to texts in general. He asked me not to take it personal but I couldn't avoid it.  
Something that I think I've been doing right is that I treat him like I treat any other friend. I have told him several times how important he is to me but now I think I should just let my actions speak for themselves, don't need to reaffirm something I let him know clear. I mostly do it for myself, I feel insecure about people not liking me.   
Interestingly, now I'm dealing with depression and I understand him better. I recently moved to another city but we're still in touch"

AskMen,fja3q2p,t3_fc8rp0,1583165744.0,"Well, now that I'm in 30s it feels like things are starting to go downhill. I've been dealing with depression for about 6 months and my psychologist suggested exercise to improve my mood.   
Initially I said yeah I will try but I didn't. I'm on meds and after a couple of months I started to see a change, I started to have more energy and motivation. It turns out I have high blood pressure so I really need to exercise.  
Those two are big reasons to hit the gym, and looking better won't hurt."

nhl,fiulcc4,t3_f9x9nw,1582743585.0,"I totally agree with another comment here, soccer is way more accessible to most people since it doesn't have any special needs. Hockey suffers for being more expensive to play and not being widely available across the country (specially in the south for obvious reasons).   

I can see the MLS growing and getting as popular as the big four leagues. Something to keep in mind is the US has the top leagues in football, baseball, basketball and hockey. The MLS is never gonna be a top league, is way far behind the European and South American leagues. The americanized style of the MLS affects its own growing and development, mainly the lack of promotion and relegation and the odd season schedule.   
I like soccer but I like hockey more. So, long live to the hockey community."
