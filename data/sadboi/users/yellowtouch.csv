schizophrenia,fbwnos6,t3_eet9mh,1577154689.0,I think that not trusting anyone is feeling like you won't manage to deal with how you will feel on what they did to you that made you sad or angry. And that is not trusting yourself. Maybe the thing is to learn how to deal with the way that you respond to what they do. Don't let them tell you how to feel. Hugs

There's a lot of lessons we need to learn in this world and even if you don't realise, you are learning some of them. So there's really no need for you to go through the same life twice if you alreary learned some of the lessons you need in this one life. This is what I believe. Hugs"
