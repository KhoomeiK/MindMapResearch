I'm not as good or able and dexterous, but with commitment am improving. 

Some medications were unhelpful along the way. Lithium gave me a tremor when I pinch my thumb and index finger, so my handwriting is crap now. Seroquel has great AD properties, and it does help with suicidal ideation, but it also messed up my coordination and ability to focus. 

It sounds like we might be in a similar situation, putting back together creative enjoyment and accomplishment. I don't know if that's an apt comparison. I'm rambling here, but you certainly aren't alone.

A big factor for me was severe anhedonia which I didn't know I had. If it's any encouragement, I've heard anhedonia is the first symptom to arrive, and in recovery, one of the last to go. So keep on it and find ways to be kind and keep self-criticism, if you tend towards that, in check with good self-talk.

I have an app called Headspace that I really like. It's expensive, but the exercises help me relax and let go of the shit in my head that f's me up.

In my case, there wasn't much forward momentum until I got some meds dialed in. I added a bit of Adderall, and that cuts the fog.
