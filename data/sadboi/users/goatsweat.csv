Bethesda has more of a night life than Rockville, but it's also more expensive. Our schools are some of the best in Maryland, anywhere in Montgomery County the schools are pretty solid. We also have tons of biotech jobs because there are a lot of research labs here. My dad is in a similar field as your fiance and works for Walter Reed and NIH is just across the street. His commute from Rockville is about 40 mins normally, 20 mins during COVID-19 haha. My mom's commute to DC on the metro is about an hour. It's pretty diverse, I grew up here as a multiracial kid and felt very comfortable. 

It really depends on if you plan to own a house or rent though. House prices are very high here, but I think renting might be more reasonable? I don't really know what the renting situation is like tbh."

I don’t think there is anything wrong with sleeping with however many people. You just have to make sure you’re doing it safely and in a way that doesn’t harm your mental health.

I realize this isn’t the ideal way to pick out a dog, but it worked out for me. He’s a very well natured dog and fits into my life perfectly. If I were looking for a performance or show dog, then I probably would let the breeder decide for me."

Should I treat it like a cutting and place it on top of some soil until the roots get bigger? Or should I just go ahead and pot it like normal?

maryland,fh96kko,t1_fh92c0c,1581374281.0,"Nah, rescuing isn’t right for everyone. We should promote rescues AND responsible breeding. 

In my county, the county shelter has like 20 ish dogs at a time usually and most are pitts or have severe behavioral issues. Most people aren’t equipped to handle something like that. Overpopulation isn’t much of a problem in this part of Maryland so much so that rescues take dogs from the South to adopt here. And a lot of these rescues in this area are super picky about who they adopt to, especially if you don’t fit their idea of an “ideal” owner. 

Rescuing is great when it works out, but it’s not such a black and white issue. Responsible breeders are in no way contributing to the shelter system."

todayilearned,fg7y3p8,t1_fg7fhx3,1580604445.0,"My Grandpa had a similar experience. He was an officer in the South Vietnamese army and we’re pretty sure he developed diabetes and bad heart disease due to his Agent Orange exposure. This is added on top of his injuries from fighting and the mental trauma as well. Since he’s not an American veteran he didn’t get any help until he became successful enough to pay for his family’s  healthcare. Luckily now he’s in his 70s and is on Medicare so he doesn’t have to worry about his coverage anymore. 

What’s even worse is my aunt most likely developed cancer as a child due to his exposure (birth defect). Luckily she was able to beat it but when she tried to have children her heart couldn’t handle it and she went into a coma and  nearly died. Now she’s doing well, but she will never have the same functionality as before the stroke. 

Agent Orange has caused so much suffering for my family and so many others, its so fucked up that the US would use such a dangerous chemical with no regard for the potential impact.

She clarified and said “your eyes are a beautiful almond shape. They look very exotic, how did you get them like that?” At this point I’m even more confused and just tell her these were the eyes I was born with and thank you for the compliment. She seemed happy with that answer and said I was very blessed. 

I really had no idea of what to make of that encounter. It’s very obvious that I’m at least part Asian so I don’t know why she thought I had plastic surgery???

Also, while East Asians tend to have a higher income, Southeast Asians tend to be disadvantaged in a similar way to URMs.

A lot of girls prefer the more “girly” games and have no interest in things like Smash or COD or whatever. I pretty much only play Animal Crossing and Pokémon because they’re relaxing and I can go at my own pace. I wouldn’t call those games boring. Shooters and action games are too stressful and I don’t really give a shit about the complex storylines of RPGs. I also HATE multiplayer games. To be fair, I have ADHD so it makes it really difficult for me to focus enough to get decent at playing shooters. 

Also, I think gaming culture as a whole tends to be sexist and unwelcoming to female players. It makes sense that girls would want to avoid that. In my experience, whenever I show interest in playing games with my guy friends, they just make fun of me for being bad and stop letting me play once it starts affecting their stats. :/ But maybe I just have shitty friends."
BPD,fcn6dy4,t3_ei0qsc,1577804465.0,"This doesn’t usually happen for me but it did once a while ago. I was dating this guy that was pretty emotionally unavailable and distant and I developed a big crush on his roommate. The roommate was really nice to me and we had a lot more in common with each other than I did with the person I was dating. We barely knew each other so it wasn’t anything serious. I never acted on it obviously and I was still very much in love with my ex. Eventually that relationship didn’t work out and I haven’t talked to either of them since then. If I were still dating that person, I think over time the crush would have faded and gone away. 

I think it’s normal to have small harmless crushes on people outside of a relationship. As long as you don’t act on them and love your significant other above everyone else it doesn’t really matter. I’m not interested in polyamory at all and very much only want a monogamous relationship. I’m not even down for threesomes or anything like that."

BPD,fcmmh2l,t3_ei02ro,1577781569.0,"Most DBT practices won’t take insurance unfortunately. My state has a law that if no provider in the state offers the treatment in network, then the insurance company MUST cover the treatment. (ie. in MD there are no DBT providers that take insurance, therefore my insurance has to cover it.) I know not every state has a law like that but it’s something to look into. We pay about $4,000 per year vs. the $12,000 it would be without insurance. It’s still very expensive and I’m honestly really fortunate my parents can afford it. 

I really wish there was a better way to get the proper treatment you need. Our healthcare system is so messed up and it’s disgusting that people can be denied treatment because they can’t afford it. I know there are some places that offer therapy services on a sliding scale, but they probably wouldn’t be DBT therapists. It’s worth reaching out to big universities near you, a lot of them offer discounted services from the students training to be psychologists/psychiatrists.

ENT specialists are surgeons that specialize in the head and neck, they are different from plastic surgeons (but sometimes their scope of practice overlaps!) Some ENTs even specialize in rhinology and they specifically focus on corrective nose surgeries. I would ask your GP for a referral!"
politics,fb8o668,t1_fb8j5g8,1576618127.0,I so want vote by mail to come to my state. My city's election recently introduced vote by mail and voter turnout more than doubled!! Every election should be mail in!

UpliftingNews,fb7w65j,t1_fb7fwn1,1576600742.0,"They can. Last time I was in the hospital my insurance covered part of the bill. I was diagnosed with a severe mental illness prior to going. We still paid thousands out of pocket because those stays are extremely expensive. On average, people are there for about 14 days, so it really adds up."
puppy101,fb758wa,t1_fb716i5,1576574641.0,"I can attest that the wiki is a very good guide. I followed it and found my dog's breeder and I couldn't be happier with going this route. The health tests really put my mind at ease, as well as the health guarantee! She even has a Facebook page for people that own her dogs and I truly feel like a part of a greater community. It's more work finding a good breeder but you'll be so happy once you find a responsible breeder for your future dog!! If you have any specific questions I can try to answer them, but the wiki is so thorough it's really all you need!"
UpliftingNews,fb74qa5,t1_fb6sxs8,1576573828.0,Yeah I would never suggest someone use the suicide hotline the way it's run now. There's no differentiation between someone experiencing ideation vs actively attempting so people get sent to the psych ward against their will when they really don't need it. The only thing that will truly help is a totally overhauled mental health system and M4A. Because most people calling the hotline really just need a good therapist but it's hard when there is a shortage of therapists and therapy is prohibitively expensive.
UpliftingNews,fb74f0v,t1_fb73cax,1576573327.0,"The hotline is pretty hit or miss, it really depends on the volunteer you get. A lot of times they'll just call the cops because you mention suicide and then you get sent to the psych ward against your will. Then you're thousands of dollars in debt and probably more suicidal than before. They don't really talk you out of it even if you are just having ideation vs. a solid plan."
mildlyinteresting,fb6mbbg,t1_fb5ji3m,1576553818.0,They even have their own police! You do NOT want to be in trouble with the USPS police because that means federal charges are coming your way.

CFB,fb2vc9k,t1_fb0rncq,1576458406.0,Yep that’s the case for me! I’m from Baton Rouge and my parents went to/worked at LSU. I grew up a LSU fan and will always root for them. I’m currently a student at Maryland so that’s my secondary flair even though I don’t really watch them and we’re pretty bad haha.

ADHD,fade4ly,t3_e8mehx,1575966687.0,I'm so happy to read this!! I'm in a similar situation. 22 and haven't been able to successfully complete a semester since freshman year. I'm starting again after a break next semester so I'm really determined to succeed this time!! I hope your future semesters will be just as successful! :-)
UMD,fadaf35,t1_fad58i4,1575961678.0,"I had a similar experience with weed and I'm glad you aren't smoking anymore. I didn't stop when I should have (I was hallucinating every time I smoked no matter who I got it from) and now I have psychosis that was most likely triggered by smoking weed excessively. Trust me you do NOT want to deal with that, I'm lucky I'm able to control it with my medication."
Art,fad817d,t1_facyaze,1575958869.0,Maybe it's because I'm Vietnamese-American and I wasn't alive during the war but nothing seems insensitive about this? It's a bit too on the nose for my tastes but I don't see why it's exploitative or anything like that.
dogs,f9t3eqt,t1_f9svzpy,1575607551.0,Seriously! My dog is fear reactive to dogs that don't respect his space so he doesn't go to the dog park. I only take him to meet ups where I know my dog is okay with the other people's dogs and we have a private space rented. I can't imagine taking a dog I know is aggressive to a dog park and risking other people's pets like that!!
reactivedogs,f9l5l93,t3_e5l5gu,1575414984.0,"This is a tough situation and I can understand both sides. If it were me, I personally would not adopt the dog, because I would be especially worried about the cats. It’s so easy for an accident to happen and if one of my pets died I would never be able to forgive myself. Obviously you are a different person and have a different tolerance for risk. 

I think it is important to not rush into any one decision. As you said, these trials take a while so I would take the time to really make sure it will work out. I think the vet behaviorist is a good idea too, they will be able to give you an idea if what you want to accomplish is realistic or not. I think you should at least see if you’ll be allowed to adopt her, but make sure you don’t let your emotions cloud your judgement. You really need to be objective about the possible behaviors you see from her. (ie. if she is too focused on the cats, it might just be best to not adopt, due to her history). 

Good luck and I hope things will work out for you, whatever you choose. It sucks that she’s in such a shitty situation."
AskReddit,f9f9ats,t1_f9f309t,1575263228.0,The earthquakes and wildfires are the biggest reason why I’d never live on the west coast. I couldn’t live anywhere near tornado alley either. I like living in the comparatively boring Mid-Atlantic. All we get here is the occasional hurricane and blizzard. To be fair we had a couple earthquakes but they were really weak and didn’t last very long.
femalefashionadvice,f9elmt3,t1_f9cbnz0,1575246112.0,"I’m the same way! I have ADHD but my sensory issues are more with taste and sound rather than touch. So it’s really hard for me to eat a wide variety of foods but I have no issues with clothing or the way things feel on my skin. I am also a fan of bright and loud clothing, as well as neutral pieces with less conventional shapes. My outfits are either super out there or sweats and there is no in between. My biggest issue is impulse purchases and later wondering why the fuck I even bought that piece of clothing."
SCAcirclejerk,f8xld0t,t1_f8x9bti,1574922729.0,I used to work with someone who put essential oils in their water everyday. I so badly wanted to tell her that it's really bad for her but she wouldn't have listened to me anyway :-(
