writing,fqmeo1g,t3_gjpdl9,1589476192.0,"I wrote a short story about a girl who had DID.  She developed her second personality (A happy-go-lucky type that cares for her and loves her) due to social isolation and loneliness as a means to cope.  Eventually, something traumatic happens to her and the original persona ""dies"", leaving only the second one left to figure out how to live the best life possible that honors her late ""friend.""
