Unless by some miracle you're lucky enough to hit your head and gain amnesia, but just for the thing that hurt you, it's impossible to at least forget being wronged. You don't have to forgive. You certainly don't have to (and probably will never be able to) forget. I think the only thing we can do is feel the hurt and work through it with time. There's no real timeline for the healing/moving on process, but I do believe time and self-improvement are the only real things that help us move on out of that ""grudge"" phase. It sucks a lot, but if it helps, try not to feel pressured into moving on. When you feel that anger, acknowledge it, accept that your feelings are valid, and try to keep doing whatever it is you're doing."

Dentistry,fk07m17,t3_ffqz5b,1583745738.0,"Certified dental assistant here. If I had the choice of either flossing or brushing for the rest of my life, I'd choose flossing. I like to equate it to washing your butt in the shower: not flossing is like washing your butt cheeks, but not your butt crack. Brushing just doesn't get in between teeth like flossing does, nor does it go below the gum line far enough. There's just no better way to scrape off all the food debris, plaque, and bacteria that can get crammed in these spaces without you feeling or seeing it. Keeping things clean between your teeth prevents tooth decay and gum disease. Those who don't floss and don't yet have issues with cavities or poor gum health are genetically lucky, had good preventative maintenance (fluoride treatments/supplements) while the teeth were developing, or have spaces between their teeth that can be accessed without floss or are too wide to trap food. These cases still can and likely will develop decay over time, it will just take longer. In short, it's very important to floss. Once a day is all you need. I like to floss before bed, so I don't have stuff in my teeth for the hours I'm sleeping."
