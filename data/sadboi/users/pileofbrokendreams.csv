depression,fh2bnnt,t3_f16s38,1581244895.0,"I feel the same way as you, just lost my closest friend today because of me being a depressed idiot and I've never felt so alone... If you need someone to talk to, I'm here and I would love to know how you're doing."
depression,epva239,t3_bw173w,1559528125.0,"I feel the same way I don't know if it's age or something but just thinking about tomorrow or the next few weeks or months or even years seems to be fucking empty and pointless. It's always the same shit everyday. You can argue that it's just for now and that I'll do shit later, vacation perhaps? Okay, that was fun. What now? Am I supposed to look forward to the next one? I really don't know how I'm supposed to look at this shit."
depression,epv7abt,t3_bvup45,1559525993.0,Right now I'm out with friends watching the NBA game at a bar in Toronto ... Why can't I just be happy? This alcohol isn't even helping and might be making it worse.
