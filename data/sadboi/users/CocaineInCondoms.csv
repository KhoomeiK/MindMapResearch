BPD,etew45w,t1_eternsm,1562749694.0,"Thank you for your reply! 
It did make me think about my statement again. I didn't grasp the fluidity at first, but your dementia example cleared it up. 

It's been couple years ago that I went there and I'm doing pretty well now under medication. 
In my circle of friends I actually do have some who were diagnosed with BPD as well. 

Idk if there's a difference between Germany and other countries when it comes to psycho therapy either. I can only talk about the situation I went through and what I have experienced. 

Whenever I read about ppl with BPD in books or see things about it on documentaries I get angry when things like ""manipulative, self-destructive, depended"" are used as basic traits and not as a possibility or one of the sub-diagnoses. 

I have found a good therapist at some point after going through some terrible ones in the end and I sincerely hope everyone who needs one will stay strong and find themselves a suitable therapist at some point."
TrueCrime,etevlpv,t1_etenc84,1562748943.0,"I don't think they're mugshots tho. Probably downloaded those pics from the church's webpage. 
With the rest of your statement I highly agree. 
Some of them pretty surely become priests in the first place just to be able to use their power over innocent children later."
BPD,etemddh,t1_ete2j0u,1562737723.0,"I understand that some diagnoses are fluid (e.g. Asperger's). I've never been told on what part of the scale I am though. Bc apperently there is none.
When I spent that weekend at the suicide watch ""aquarium"" (I wasn't suicidal but I used to harm myself and cut a little bit too deep) I haven't been talking to any doctors until Monday. Not in a private session I gotta say. The doctor has never seen me before, I have never went to therapy before either but she spat her diagnose at me in a way of ""well, you perform self harm so obviously this is BPD"". 
I just got the feeling that this diagnose is so lose and therefore easy to be put as a label on almost everybody who's a out of order. 
If it is fluid, why is there no spectrum?
I feel offended by most traits BPD ppl are ""supposed"" to have. I am not manipulative for example, or irrational or too focused on my spouse yadda yadda yadda. Neither are people I know who are diagnosed with it. 
It seems to me that some doctors just really like using this diagnose, especially when it comes to self-harm, because it is a little more lose than others. 

I like discussing this tho. It's just my own point of view."
