Anxiety,fk449rc,t1_fim8mam,1583852993.0,Pretty much like others here I like sleep because it is a temporary escape of sorts and I kinda love going to sleep. But there is that nagging anxiety that most likely my anxiety dreams are going to wake me up waaaay before my alarm. I almost never sleep till my alarm. I’m up worrying about the shit on my plate. So from the moment my eyes open I’m in high gear with anxiety/panic. This has been going on for 2 weeks now. Last time it was like this was in the fall and that lasted more like 8-9 weeks.  I guess the silver lining to the insomnia is that it is a “warning light” that I need to get back to some of the tools in my toolbox for countering anxiety that have worked in the past.

# “I walk down the street.There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.I fall in.I am lost... I am helpless.It isn't my fault.It takes forever to find a way out.I walk down the same street.There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.I pretend I don't see it.I fall in again.I can't believe I am in the same place.But, it isn't my fault.It still takes me a long time to get out.I walk down the same street.There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.I see it is there.I still fall in. It's a habit.My eyes are open.I know where I am.It is my fault. I get out immediately.walk down the same street.There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.I walk around it.I walk down another street.”
