mentalhealth,fn8zn6g,t1_fn8x7gc,1586754731.0,"That is a valid fear for sure. It’s difficult, but I hope you know there are certainly therapists/people out there who absolutely won’t make you feel invalidated and misunderstood. And that’s a good step to take during this time! You’re doing great. Thank you for your support as well!"
mentalhealth,fn8yuf6,t1_fn8xmdp,1586754050.0,"Yes, I definitely get that! The therapist I have now told me that everything I share with her will be kept confidential, except if I say I am suicidal or trying to hurt myself. That’s when she said she would have to reveal to someone else what I’ve told her since there’s possibly a good chance that I could hurt myself. In my first appointment with her when she asked me if I had recently thought about harming myself, I told her I had, but I went on to explain the situation and that it was the first time in awhile that I had felt that way, but that I had found something to keep me from doing it and I hadn’t felt like hurting myself/haven’t felt like a threat to myself since. She understood and didn’t push me to be sent to the hospital or anything. Therefore, I feel like you can definitely tell them about what’s happened in your past and what’s going on with you now without them sending you the hospital, as long as you explain to them that you don’t feel like you’re currently a threat to yourself. I hope that makes sense!"
mentalhealth,fn8x1f1,t1_fn8wac6,1586752570.0,"Also, usually a therapist will start out asking you questions to learn more about you and your mental health history so they can know how to approach your specific situation, and they are trained to help you talk through what it is you want to talk about. Another piece of advice I’d give is, be honest with them. You don’t know them, they don’t know you, and they are trained to help you—not hurt you or make fun of you. It should be a judgement-free zone. If it’s not that way, they shouldn’t be a therapist/they’re doing their job completely wrong."
mentalhealth,fn8wac6,t3_g0a4eq,1586751969.0,"I just recently found a therapist that I absolutely love! It can take time, which I understand can be frustrating. But you’re bound to find someone who you click with and who is truly helpful. You actually sound a lot like me/our mental struggles seem similar along with having been treated like we’re dumb when we finally gain the courage to speak up about how we feel. Something my new therapist has been working with me on is my self-esteem. I’ve found that it has helped a lot not only within myself but in my relationship with others. It’s such a basic thing, I never thought it would make that much of a difference. I actually thought it was stupid at first, but you know what they say—don’t knock it til you’ve tried it. You are allowed to tell yourself things like “I’m worth it,” “I am kind,” “I am smart,” etc., and not be self-absorbed.

I am praying for you, OP! I’m rooting for you, and the Lord certainly is too!"
mentalhealth,fn8vc17,t3_g0a1wl,1586751217.0,[Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/text-us/)  This is a free service involving trained volunteers where you can text them about what you’re going through/feeling and they help talk you through it. I’ve heard several great things about it. Hopefully this helps! I’ll be praying for you!
mentalhealth,fn8sb38,t3_fzzvaf,1586748962.0,"I don’t know if you’re still reading the comments in this/if this will even be seen, but hopefully you do see it. What prompted me to join reddit is I’ve seen how many people are crying out for help in the midst of their depression, anxiety, any mental illness, and I wanted to help because I’ve been there too. Notice I said “I’ve been there”—past tense. I struggled with anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and horrible self-esteem issues throughout high school and college, spent time in the hospital for suicidal ideation. Several times I was convinced it would never get better, I thought “after what has happened to me/for as long as I’ve felt bad, there’s no possible way.” Please hear me out when I say, it does get better. I thank God now that I didn’t end my life. High school and college are very difficult times—and that’s not something I think many of us expect, including me. They’re full of change and transition, along with trying to figure out your identity and forming relationships with others, and a lot more. It can be really hard on a person. You are heard and your feelings are valid. I hope you might seek out a therapist or a wise, trusted, compassionate person to talk to. Therapy has saved me—I didn’t know it was possible, but there really is a method to their madness.

Take it one step, one day at a time. If you need to talk, vent, whatever, my PM is open. I will also be praying for you. I don’t know if you are religious, but this too is something that has surprised me after years of what felt like abandonment from God. He loves you, more than you know. And again, I’m here if you need me."
