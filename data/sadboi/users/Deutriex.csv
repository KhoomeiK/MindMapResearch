SuicideWatch,fe7n6pa,t3_eieayu,1578916870.0,"Absolutely. I am a 25-year old Brazilian man. To make things worse, people instead of helping me, they make me suffer even more by remembering my problems and judging my mistakes. If I passed away, My life and its end wouldn't be broadcasted on TV. I had a chance to put an end on my problems, but I didn't win the New Year Eve's lottery (Called here as Mega da Virada). I had 1 in 240,000 chance to sim the prize. It  could have truly changed my life. I feel like a living deadweight doomed to suffer forever during my miserable existence. I have no forces to deal with my major financial problems even I want to kep things sorted out. I risk losing everything the Brazilian law allows to be forfeited. I am close to bankruptcy. Every day, my suicidal thoughts become more and more frequent. People sent me to a psychiatrist, but the doctor definitively won't pay my bills. I hope soon I will close my eyes and I will never wake up again!"
