ReadMyScript,f41zxdw,t1_f41gb39,1571325834.0,"This is just my opinion so you may disagree but I feel like your dialogue is sort of melodramatic. Some of the character's statements don't feel like any conversation I've ever heard. I found doing a read through with a friend or even by myself has made me realize when dialogue could be made better.

I think including what is discussed between Bree and Holly may  would help add to making her growth make more sense"
ReadMyScript,f410e78,t1_f40y29e,1571312085.0,"u/critical_stoat made some good points. I personally feel that the focus should be on Bree and Freya's relationship as that is more interesting plotline. If you want it to focus on finding the mother, then give the audience more reason to care about finding her. Otherwise relegate her to.

I second the point about character's shifting emotions too fast. If you are going to deal with serious issues like abuse, then you're going to want the dialogue to be as true to life as possible.

The ending felt like a twist for a sake of a twist. It didn't seem consistent with Bree's character.

Overall some very promising ideas but definitely in need of some rewrites. I'd love to read a new draft when it is finished."
