Letterkenny,fnch2ia,t1_fn3nmog,1586836579.0,"Yeah. There’s one line delivered by Tim Kitzrow after a fight that goes, “He’ll need to put some ice on it. By it, I mean his entire body.” Still the best line of the entire game."

Letterkenny,fn39bff,t1_fn2pm0s,1586615891.0,"I assumed with Boomtown being a bit of a thicker guy, I would just put him into goal. Besides Reilly and Jonesy, I had to assume numbers and handedness."

depression,eu4067t,t3_cd0hjp,1563432156.0,"This sounds a lot like what I’ve been going through lately. It feels like I’ve been cycling and just going through the motions each and every week. A month ago, I moved into my own townhouse. While it is exciting, it’s daunting to think of all the tasks I need to complete in order to maintain myself and the house. I still have things to unpack and put in their place. However, I rarely have the energy or desire to do so after I get home from work. There are even some days where I would like to stay home from work in order to focus on my house. I don’t have much more vacation days left though due to taking an international trip with my girlfriend in late June."
FuckMyLife,eu3zhrg,t1_ethbtcw,1563431334.0,"Going off of what the person above said, you should look at the company’s mission statement or philosophy. Do you agree with it? If no, then the company is probably not a good fit. Think of it like a relationship between you and the company. If neither party can agree on anything, then it just won’t work in the end. Yes, there will have to be some compromise, but make sure the company’s philosophy aligns with your views."

AskReddit,erpmm5s,t1_eroybwh,1561122472.0,"I saw 50 Cent at this venue in Illinois called Ravinia. There’s a pavilion with the stage and then just a huge lawn. If you have lawn seats you can bring your own food, drinks, and chairs. Me and my friends stocked up on food and drinks (I brought premixed Bacardi cocktails, of course). The day of I got nervous cause the shuttle driver to the venue said he was only going to play for an hour and fifteen minutes.

So 50 Cent comes on stage with a DJ and a hype man. They would play maybe twenty seconds to a minute of one song and move on to another song. The shittiest part is that it was mostly the DJ playing the backing track with 50 Cent contributing very little to each song. And the shuttle driver was right too. With 50 Cent’s main set and encore, the concert only lasted one hour and 20 minutes."
AskReddit,erk1onw,t3_c2a2to,1560953131.0,"I know it’ll be an unpopular opinion, but “A to Z” from 2014 deserves a second season. Each episode started with a letter in the alphabet and they only made thirteen episodes. At least let them get through the entire alphabet. “A to Z” was not the greatest show, but there was no time for them to develop the characters."
