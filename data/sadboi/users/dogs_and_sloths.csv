If that doesn't work - maybe the pomodoro technique will help you (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
And try to exercise. You can try the 5-minute morning yoga (https://youtu.be/4C-gxOE0j7s), maybe you can do it with your daughter? Try to find any activities to do with her indoors as spending time with her usually helps you."

mentalhealth,f10j8ix,t3_d7d0zb,1569113374.0,"Hi there! You're now in a toxic environment and the best advice that I can give you is to move the hell out. Do you have a friend on whose couch you can crash for a week? If it's not an option, get a part-time job and find a bed to sleep on. You'll figire out the rest (how to get a place/find a roommate/etc) once you've calmed down a bit.  After that you will be able to think clearly (speaking from my own experience here).

I'm sorry that your cousin is not the person you thought he was and that he doesn't care about your prior agreement about your stay. I understand that you're under a lot of stress, it sounds really hard. But your cousin clearly doesn't want you in his house. Also you've agreed to ""stay with him for a while before getting your own place"", so how did it transform to ""I'm stuck living with him until January""? Idk, does ""for a while"" mean ""for a few months""? You don't like him and his bf, he doesn't like you, they prioritize airbnb-guests over you (because it's (part of?) their income and it's actually reasonable in my opinion). So it's inconvinient for everyone. Then why are you living there?

upd: get therapy if you can. It's hard to overcome abuse on your own."
