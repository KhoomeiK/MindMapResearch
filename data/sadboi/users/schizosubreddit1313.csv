schizophrenia,f5skga0,t1_f5ngit1,1572434501.0,I’m sorry that you had to go through that. I never lose control or have anything too horrible happen it was just that two months of drinking everyday had a cumulative effect and I was struggling with work and realized I was becoming miserable. The thing is now without alcohol I have slightly more anxiety instead of a worse mood.
schizophrenia,f5skagu,t1_f5qomt4,1572434317.0,It could be too high. The last time I was hospitalized the doctors in the hospital agreed to lower my dose from 120mg (max daily dose) to 90mg to lessen side effects. The doctor I was seeing at the time refused to allow that to happen and kept me on the max daily dose. I think one day a week is probably more reasonable and still allows me to do things socially involving alcohol. I’m thinking fridays after I finish my work week because it gives me a full two days to fully normalize. Sometimes social interactions can be more uncomfortable and awkward the day after drinking.

If they still ignore you then you have to bide your time until you get out. I’m sorry you are going through this.

I also have schizophrenia. When I went from drinking every 2-3 days to drinking everyday my voices got much worse. Even though I was not pouring it out and drinking it it is still a waste of money. I’m on social security and work part time and I realized that the main reason I was working was to buy beer because my family wouldn’t support the habit as much as I’d liked.

If you ever have issues with anxiety from withdrawal or any withdrawal symptoms/cravings I’d recommend asking your doctor about naltrexone. It helped me immensely last year when I quit and makes stopping much easier. 

Even after three days I’ve noticed my mood has improved and I’m less irritable. For most people alcohol will cause anxiety and depression but for us we also have to worry about psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotics are also more effective when you don’t drink so you should do better with your symptoms.

But anyways. It sounds like you have actual talent to be studying jazz and composition. A month is far to short of a period to give up on something. I wasn’t that great and couldn’t do much but it sounds like you have talent and are merely dealing with a loss of inspiration. Maybe take some time off or try to relieve the pressure and stress of the situation somehow by taking a step back. A year off from study might seem like the end of the world but if its what you need to develop a clear perspective and reassess things then maybe its worth a try.
