So yeah... Saying it's *just* an SSD, which helps loading games faster. Shows a lack of understanding and the implications it has...

Edit: About the CPU being weaker, time will tell... Theres a lot being offloaded from the CPU (Audio and  Decompression for example), so the CPU has more to work with...

Regarding the GPU... It has 36 CUs, with very high clocks... Cerny says this: ""Also, it's easier to fully use 36 CUs in parallel than it is to fully use 48 CUs - when triangles are small, it's much harder to fill all those CUs with useful work""

Rendered in real time, with what looks like VERY stable - frames. 

Im MUCH impressed already. Seriously, this is sick. Smaller studios, must be getting VERY excited about all this"

PS5,fqhhiv7,t1_fqh8le2,1589377116.0,"You could be right. Geoff was downplaying Tony Hawk, but he's definitely not doing that this time around.

Those are pretty big implications :p"
PS5,fqhgrmw,t1_fqh9p3w,1589376665.0,"Hahaha perfect

But like with Cerny's, Road to PS5 - it might take some time for less tech savvy people to digest the implications.

Unless they use a lot of visual aids/demos. Which I hope they do :D"
PS5,fqhfd67,t1_fqh82if,1589375811.0,"Were reaching the point of diminishing returns, on resolution. Where more pixels, doesn't translate to better ""graphics"".

Thats why RayTracing is so interesting. Instead of mimicking light, we simulate it... its VERY performance heavy... but im willing to take a bet - that we'll see pathtracing be done on real games by the end of this gen 

Having said that, asset creation will be the next (current) ""bottleneck"". Thats why Epic Games acquired Quixel. They see the value in shortening asset creation.

Hopefully, they will take it another step further - and will use AI/ML assisted (generative) design. This means, smaller studios will be able to create bigger/more detailed worlds. (Asset creation, is a huge money/time sink)

ML can also assist in performance savings. But thats more of a hardware thing (GPU)... (DLSS 2.0 as example)

If was a betting man, I would bet on these getting highlighted..."
PS5,fqha9zv,t1_fqh94io,1589372398.0,I share your excitement! Lets goooo
PS5,fqh9vse,t3_giwd1k,1589372106.0,"I'll probably catch some flack for saying this but. To me it feels like, a lot of people are being entitled...

And have no understanding, of the impact this global situation has. Really disappointing..."
PS5,fqh8idg,t1_fqh7v1m,1589371032.0,"Gotta temper expectations, especially during these times.

Look how at Geoff was downplaying Tony Hawk, before yesterday. That's a game with quite a bit of prestige.

Specially for those, who grew up with Ps1 and Ps2."
PS5,fqh7x5p,t1_fqh7ima,1589370551.0,"Yes it is!

Here's the link: https://youtu.be/pp98SUBZYH8

It'll start in about 2 hours"
PS5,fqh7is9,t1_fqh7289,1589370218.0,"Can't correct you, because you aren't wrong. But this gives us a general direction, of where things are going.

I would even be excited, if they mentioned implementing anything related to Networking/ML/AI (as they can be used for Performance saving)... but thats just me..."
PS5,fqh769x,t1_fqh6ozg,1589369923.0,"- Todays SGF, was mentioned it would affect the entire industry.

- ZhugeEX, seems excited

- This tweet

- Today's SGF will be around an hour long

- There will be an interview

Might not be UE5 and just a general showcase/tech talk. But we'll see in a couple of hours"
PS5,fqh6j2w,t1_fqh655j,1589369364.0,"For some. For others, it really isn't.

This Engine is used by every platform... PS5, PS4, XB1, XSX, PC, Mobile, Switch and VR

So it's kind of a big deal..."
PS5,fqh5rhf,t1_fqh5loe,1589368673.0,"Im afraid so. 

But im sure Epic is smarter than this and will start with a sizzle real. Thats the best way, to shut people up lol"
PS5,fqh5oh7,t1_fqh5jmb,1589368600.0,I like tech talks. So definitely! (For me at least)
