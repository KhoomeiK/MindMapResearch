It goes against intuition, but the best i understand it, the more you think about it the worse it will get. Perhaps this says something about the true world around us or the way people think....

Definatley, I would advise you learn some programming, if you can data science basically as well. Python would be you're best bet since it's free though there are programs like mat lab which have also been used with BCI processing. 

You can work with data and stuff to start off with to understand the basics of processing this data.
When you want to start using you're own equipment, if you're looking for the most affordable stuff I'd go with OpenBCI. They have many perks such as completley open source software as well as using wireless amplifiers. 

Also, what I did was started regularly reading up on journal articles in the field. It will get you familiarized with many of the new terms that are popping up and the ones that are commonly used. (You'll also get experience reading scientific articles) 
Use google scholar and start looking. If theres a paywall behind one of the cool sounding articles just find its DOI number , URL, or PMID and paste it into a site called sci hub!

That's all for now,  PM me if you have any questions."
