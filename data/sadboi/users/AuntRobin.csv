TwoXChromosomes,flojp22,t3_fpyd9q,1585339606.0,"I actually live in a 55+ community that is built with a golf course running through it. We are basically in lockdown, but the golf course is open to anybody who lives here. Normally you have to either be a paid member or pay to use it on the day, but nobody cares about that right now. It lets the seniors sort of socialize, and at least get some exercise. They‚Äôre constantly talking about gathering in driveways and things. I much prefer they use separate golf carts and do this.
I can see them out my window and they seem to be keeping an appropriate distance. Nobody‚Äôs gathering at holes/tees or anything."

NoStupidQuestions,ewn9384,t3_coun78,1565571862.0,"Can confirm Walmart often has small bank branches inside. I worked as a teller in one for about a year. 
Our in-branch joke was that you knew you were at _____Bank in Walmart if you could pick up a ski mask, a pair of gloves, a gun & ammo to go with it, and do your banking, all at one convenient location.

More pedantic bank staff would point out that you‚Äôd have to get either the bullets or the gun, run them out to the car and then come get the other part. Walmart will cheerfully sell you both, but not in the same visit.  I would point out that just gave you a reason to go back to the car so you could ‚Äúgear up‚Äù for the job."

I moved into my parents retirement house (across country from where they raised me) because dad had quit chemo & I thought mom would need help (also issues at my apt, but I could‚Äôve gone to a friend instead of here). 
He only lived about 6 weeks after I got here. 
I didn‚Äôt really set up my room because there was more important stuff to deal with. I forgot that I‚Äôd be spiraling soon & now it‚Äôs been about 18 mos & I still have stuff from the apt packed in the garage & my room is a wreck.

Our store was very often the place parents told their kids to wait for them if hey got separated (we had a giant screen in the back that often had movies or a sing along type video running).  Also common to drop them in front of the screen & run off to another store for an hour. We got to be pretty good with calling security for ‚Äúlost parents.‚Äù
