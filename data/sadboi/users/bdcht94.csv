Anxiety,fpw0n6p,t1_fp9qjwc,1588955192.0,"Hey. I've been going through the same things for a month and a half now. Been anxious for years too but lately it's been harder than ever, especially the shallow breathing feeling and constant tightness in the chest. I can't help you just like I can't help myself but Im sending you strength and positive feelings. I keep repeating this mantra ""I let go. I trust my future."" and it helps having a thought to come back to when it keeps spinning around up there. Hold on."

Anxiety,fnip53e,t3_g1qw7m,1586983886.0,"Welcome and thanks for taking the time to help others ! I'm 28F and have been suffering fir GAD for almost 8 years. My main anxiety focus is health anxiety/fear of illness and catastrophes (natural disasters, plane crashes...). As you can imagine, this period is a living nightmare to me because it's litteraly a health-related global catastrophe. I've been suffering from hyperventilation for a month now. It makes my life very very painful. Breathing exercises and meditation/yoga can't seem to help me like they did in the past with panic attacks, because I feel that I'm already wayyy too focused on my breathing pattern. I'd like to LET GO of that focus and find a natural breathing rythm again. What advice could you give me ? Thanks a lot..."
Anxiety,fnioa2f,t1_fmg0ofw,1586983451.0,"Kudos to you for getting your anxiety under control all along. I just posted my own answer to this thread and you'll see that I didn't have the same experience at all, unfortunately :( If you have any advice to ride through the shortness of breath, please send them my way, I'll be so so grateful. Thanks again for your statement, you seem like a brave and resilient person :)"
Anxiety,fninvvl,t3_fuznnl,1586983259.0,"Hi there ! I'm a 28F living in Paris who's been suffering with generalized anxiety disorder and particularly health anxiety for years since one of my best friends died from an aneurysm at age 14...Here's my personal tale of Covid+Anxiety. :)

First I gotta say I couldn't be tested because I live in Paris, France and in my country, for some reason, you can get tested only if you're a doctor/nurse or if you're a patient with severe symptoms and have to be admitted in a hospital. So I couldn't be tested but I was followed by my GP for several weeks after I presented chills, diarrhea (lasted + than 7 days), discreet dry cough (with rare phlegm), extreme fatigue and loss of appetite that led to accelerated weightloss (6kg in 2 weeks). I also had a pharyngitis that lasted almost 3 weeks, with a light ear infection at the end (last symptom).

I also had constant breathlessness but my lungs were clear all along so there wasn't any sign of pneumonia. To this day, I don't know if it was anxiety-induced or not, but note that after 30 days since my first symptoms, breathlessness is my ONLY remaining symptom. All of the others gradually disappeared these last 3 weeks. This breathlessness has been exhausting and extremely stressful to say the least. So my GP and I've decided to get me tested for any other reason that could explain the shortness of breath : I had a blood test to spot any inflammatory syndrome, a chest X-Ray, heart ultrasound images : all came back clear :) My last appointment is tomorrow, with a pulmonologist. If that last exam does come back clear too, that'd mean that my severe anxiety triggers these breathlessness crisis. In that case, we can easily say that my severe anxiety disorder made things 1000% more painful for me during this illness that was already exhausting in itself. I hope these factual evidences that I don't have any life-threatening disease or after-effects will help me move on and finally accept that I'm okay and fully recovering. It'll be a tough road and I'll be grateful to anyone that already experienced long-lasting anxiety-induced dyspnea for any sort of feedback, advice, words :)

Take care everyone :)"
Anxiety,fnil07b,t1_fm8xtls,1586981824.0,"Hi ! So after my last comment my GP told me I probably have had COVID because of all the other symptoms (light cough, diarrhea, migraines, extreme fatigue and weightloss - lost 6kg). I even had an ear infection at the very end. I wasn't able to be tested though because.... France ! Lmao. I called emergency services on the peak point and they couldn't tell me anything other than stay home and wait to get better...

All of these symptoms have gradually disappeared for almost two weeks now (yaaay!) so I'm considered as recovering. I've gained weight again. The only thing that remained is the shortness of breath that can get pretty extreme sometimes, and it's really hard to know wether it is still due to the illness or extreme anxiety. I've made several examinations (auscultation, blood tests, chest X-ray, heart ultrasound) and they all came back all clear :) I'm eventually going to see a pulmonologist tomorrow and after that I'll more or less be set on wether or not this breathlessness is anxiety-induced or due to a specific Covid consequence. Will keep you posted if you want. Glad to read you seem okay. We'll get through it :)"
Anxiety,flbbjcu,t3_fnp6oh,1585001282.0,Sadly I have no answer for you but will follow this thread because I've been asking myself the same question for a week of breathlessness now (strong health anxiety here too).
Anxiety,fkuntcl,t1_fkscrvu,1584552858.0,Thanks for your comment :) been experiencing shallow breathing for 2 days and it's the worst in this context..
Anxiety,fkun94c,t1_fktj2ok,1584552560.0,"No fever at all no. Called a late night doctor yesterday, she was awesome. She checked me up completely (listened to my lungs, used an oxymeter, blood pressure...) and reassured me a lot. She said I was fine, that I didn't need to worry too much because the illness was very hard on old and fragile people, but I wasn't at risk. She said that she'd seen dozens of Covid19 patients the same night and told me they were all doing pretty fine, just home watching series. I told her about my anxiety disorder and she was really understanding because she's been suffering with panic disorder for years too. She gave me a prescription for a light tranquilizer which I bought but didn't use for the moment (I have bad memories of uses). She was really really nice, it helped me go through the night but during the day the shortbreathness came back and now I'm at more or less the same place than I was yesterday... That sucks so much. :("
Anxiety,fksdhsk,t1_fks4vrr,1584487634.0,"Paris, France here ! Came here for the same stuff. Haven't had any symptom for a few days other than huge anxiety (self-quarantined myself by Thursday) and then today I started coughing and having very short breath. It's been awful, I feel like I'm gonna pass out any moment. I feel you, really."
