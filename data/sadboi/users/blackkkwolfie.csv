schizoaffective,ew1vz5a,t3_cm0wwt,1565032677.0,"I was taking Cipralex 2 years ago. Then I was 15 years old. Well, it didn‚Äôt work for me. I felt nothing. Literally. I lost a lot of weight. I lost like 10 kg in one month, but I am sure it wasn‚Äôt because of the antidepressant, it was because of the depression. But I‚Äôve heard of many people who gained a lot of weight. Even my psychiatrist told me that I was going to gain weight. Maybe it didn‚Äôt work for me because then the doctors realised that instead of just depression I am having a lot of other problems like schizoaffective. You should be careful with taking antidepressants because some may work for u and other may harm u. U should try different types under the control of a psychiatrist."
schizoaffective,ew1uml4,t3_cm8g2g,1565031819.0,When I was in a depression I was feeling terrible and I realised it. But then my mum told the psychiatrist that sometimes my mood gets under no control.

relationship_advice,ervntgv,t3_c42mbs,1561320590.0,"First of all, be careful with the emotional decisions. You should be thinking straight before doing anything. I think you should go to a therapist yourself, because you‚Äôre holding everything inside you, which I am sure is killing you slowly. You should share with someone how you feel, because the relief will make you more calm. After doing this comes the next step - talk with her. Tell her how you feel, tell her how painful this is for you and that you need someone to overcome the situation with. If she cannot help you then I am sorry but in my opinion you‚Äôre not one for another. In one relationship the closeness is very important and if she isn‚Äôt the person who is there for you and if she isn‚Äôt the one who can help you with your own struggles then you should find someone who really makes you happy instead of angry. Find a good therapist and share every thought you have on your mind."
