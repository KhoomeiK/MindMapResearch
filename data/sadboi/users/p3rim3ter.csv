Psychosis,fibhiqb,t1_fibgtga,1582322067.0,"I guess it's best to just see what others are experiencing and the limits of what psychosis does to them so that you can learn what your psychosis is 'capable' of doing to you. This way, even if it is really convincing, you'd know deep inside at the back of your mind that others have lived through it and have fared well, so you'd be twice as calm about the myriad of things they are trying to make you believe. At the end of the day - follow the simple rule - Hallucinations generally harm you if you end up harming yourself. If you understand that that's their limitation, you'd know that the person in control is you, not them. :)"
Psychosis,fibge4h,t3_f7h16n,1582321385.0,"The short answer is - no.

I think the information you are referring to is about the voices and hallucinations threatening to take control of you or to make you harm others. Truth is, that happens to a lot of people with psychosis. Pretty much all of them live with the fear of hurting others but, in reality they end up never doing it.

In other words - the hallucinations, believable as they might be, are just trying to trick you to injure yourself, rather than having the power to make their promises true. They are lying, is another short answer. Test it, you'd be pleasantly surprised and you'd end up living your entire life without doing the things they are referring to. Proof lies in the fact that a ton of people experience exactly what you do - and they end up living normally and their fears not coming true.

Hope this helps and that you feel better after reading it."
Psychosis,fbvjgzu,t1_fbviijl,1577131684.0,"I've seen people experience those as part of psychosis, just that meds cause them as well. I've seen a case when a person experienced them only when entering buildings and thought that somebody was placing devices in said buildings to 'block' their thoughts or to prevent them from doing work.

It could be a part of the disease course, but if it's something new - keep a look out for other symptoms if you have experienced psychosis before.

My take on that feeling is a neurotransmitter imbalance. You could try aerobic exercising to see if it helps, but don't guarantee that it would. (could take a month or more to see results, but if it helps you in the time immediately after exercising, it's promising that it could help you out more!)

Hope it's not bothering you too much or that you get it resolved.

Good luck!"
Psychosis,fbvinp1,t3_edxcru,1577131349.0,"Hi!  


Hope you're doing well apart from what you've written about.

The things you are describing could be due to medication, if you're on some. Especially antipsychotics. Once you're off them, you'd be fine! Just that things that mess with serotonin and dopamine - also mess with the eyes. Can cause very weird things, sensations, and eyesights problems.

Maybe consult your doctor about taking your meds at a different time, start probiotics, vitamin supplements (B complex 50 is a good choice), and exercise (aerobic works best, it's hard at first but it's awesome once you get past the initial hurdle and you'd want it more and more! Would help a lot).

Hope this helps! Happy holidays! :)"

Psychosis,fbvhthk,t3_ee4sbd,1577131006.0,"Almost everybody does something bad during psychosis, it's normal.

What you should remember is not to blame the people around you or yourself, it's just the way of life. If people leave you or don't keep in touch with you because of it - it doesn't mean that they are bad people, it's normal to be afraid of what you don't know. If they knew more about psychosis they'd be more accepting!  


Also, don't blame yourself, almost everybody does stupid things during psychosis, it's absolutely normal and, in time, (Hopefully) society would get to accept that more, as long as information gets spread about psychotic disorders and their course.

&#x200B;

People really don't mean to be bad or mean to you because of it, they just don't see or understand it the way it really is. Psychosis makes you do stupid things, it's not yourself. So, be yourself, remember who you are, stay strong and try not to blame people for how they act. After all, they just don't understand. They are still the same people, just that they are not as informed as you are :)  


Sorry for the tangent, thought it might help.

I see a lot of people posting that those are hallucinations - well, they are illusions, slightly different phenomenon, but maybe people should be aware that they happen more often to people with psychosis and shouldn't bother them as much as real hallucinations.

Another thing you could check is with an eye doctor to see for aberrations of the lense of the eye. (unlikely, but if you'd like, you could check, that produces similar things.)

&#x200B;

Also, once you're on meds those things could start happening, if you quit meds recently, maybe give it some time to clear.

Psychosis,fbvgdhj,t3_ee69kp,1577130413.0,"Those thoughts happen a lot to people. It's not just you.  


A common technique used in psychotherapy is to try to make people not perform 'ritualistic' answers to those thoughts. I.e. if you hear a bad thought, try not to always say to yourself 'that's not what I meant' or 'no, I don't think that', rather just try to be positive about it for a while by not paying attention to them or saying to yourself that it's actually pretty awesome that you know that you, yourself, are not actually like that... Imagine having thoughts like that and actually following them without burden... Well, that's not you! How awesome is it knowing that you are better than that? Maybe look at those thoughts and think of how much better you are for not being the next person not being bothered and following them! If anything, it is only a sign that you are a good human being with knowledge of how bad things can be, or at least you have a glimpse of how somebody evil might be cursed into thinking like that... Just keep your cool, know that you are better and you are being told that by those thoughts every day and not following them, and, in time, you'd stop caring about them so much!

Thank you for the wonderful message!  


Wish you all the best!"
Psychosis,fa0cqbw,t3_e77g9c,1575752871.0,"Hi,

What you are describing is similar to what someone susceptible to psychosis from marijuana would describe. Racing thoughts/images, etc. I would suggest that since the drug is having such an effect on you - try not to continue using it! Some people are more susceptible than others, but the symptoms you are describing could point to a susceptibility to a drug-induced psychosis.

Not saying that you would develop psychosis or any disorder like that! Just advising you to stop now, and you should be fine as long as you abstain.

Also, how old are you? You don't have to state it exactly, but are you in your teens/early 20s? If so - at least try not using the drug until you're 30 after your brain has finished developing... You don't want to alter the normal course of development with early drug initiation, especially with symptoms like that. Ideally, you'd just not use it, but it's up to you! You could be fine with it too, not saying you wouldn't, just giving my piece of advice here.

Hope this helps."
Psychosis,fa0c1oe,t3_e7hs7f,1575752491.0,"Hi,

How bad is your memory? Does it get progressively worse over time? Do you remember yesterday? Observe yourself for the following - once you try to think of something in your memory, is it hard or impossible? Have you lost parts of your life's memory because of it?

Also, when you are just thinking of things (as your thoughts go by different topics) - do you happen to think of/remember things that you would normally not be able to?"
Psychosis,fa0brxv,t3_e7ahnc,1575752338.0,"Hi,

A take home point is - are you enjoying your dreams? Are they real to you? After all, they are indeed part of your life? Maybe think of it as an adventure you get to be on every night after a hard day? You get to enjoy things that others can't always do! In a way, having those dreams is like going on vacation/having a break after the day is over, so I suggest you don't just shrug them off as 'not real,' rather think of them as part of your experience in this life, some freedom if you'd like, a part of who you get to be on this planet, so why should they not be real? You get to live through them after all :)

If you'd like to discuss it more or have any questions - please feel free to ask!

Hope this helps."
Psychosis,fa0b9rm,t3_e7jlen,1575752061.0,"Hi,

Is this delusion making you act differently? The most important thing is for you to observe yourself and to check yourself from time to time as to whether you are doing something that 'fits' the delusion, such as acting according to that belief. In case you can control it, you don't feel an urge to act in a way because of the delusion, then you shouldn't worry too much! A delusion can be hard to get rid of, but it is not always harmful!

A point that could help you is to think - if we are living in a simulated reality, then how come it shouldn't be appreciated as a real one too? How come you can't appreciate the fact that, say your delusions make you believe this isn't the real world and just a simulated one that we live in, it is still a real experience, as real as it gets.. If you think about it - the value we put into things depends on us, what we as human beings value is abstract and the only reason it is valuable is because we put an effort into making it such or believe that it is.

If this world were to be simulated, why should it disappoint you? It is still as real as it gets to you and to everybody around you. If you were living outside the simulation and decided to play some VR, would you appreciate it for what it is? Don't want to trigger you, I hope I don't (I guess you already had this delusion, so I hope nothing new arises), but I've actually thought about it and the point is - even if a simulation were to exist, all the rules of society, logic, physics, etc. apply here, so just try to enjoy it for what it is, hopefully you'd gain some of that appreciation as to how little it matters whether a life is simulated or not, you still feel, see, touch, experience, you have other people and living things around you that all get to do that, so it is as real as it gets!

If you have any questions or would like to add something, please do! If I've said something wrongly or I've triggered your delusional thinking - I am sorry, I was just trying to make a point about the appreciation of the fact that life is what you make of it and you should enjoy it for what it is."
Psychosis,fa04jyy,t3_e7hznl,1575748886.0,"Hi, I hope you're okay...

As to the voices, if you'd like you could read my post from this week, it explains how manipulative or believable the voices can be... ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/e5pe60/what\_everybody\_should\_know\_about\_psychosis\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/e5pe60/what_everybody_should_know_about_psychosis_and/))

Truth be told, I agree with you, voices can seem like they are psychic, they do seem like they know things they can't possibly know... In reality however, what I suggest you do is to watch some videos from people with schizophrenia or read their stories/accounts of it... (you could start with the accounts of Elliott [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6aewHsUJxgn\_SVkPdbYGkA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6aewHsUJxgn_SVkPdbYGkA))

The main point is that what the voices do is sometimes repetitive in terms of them saying/making you experience things that they also do to other people as well. This should lead you to question your doubt about them being a real being or psychic... Why? Well, if they were real, divine/evil, or all powerful/psychic, then how come some of the experiences that happen to people are quite similar or the same across several people who have the disorder. (Not saying you have schizophrenia, just giving an example.) Once you realize how much of what you are experiencing happens to other people as well and considering that you share a brain that evolved the same way as theirs + the fact that a mastermind plotting to talk to you/make you do things would usually be more productive rather than just trying to do the same thing over and over again... It brings a sense of clarity, I hope, realizing that the abnormal mechanism of the brain shares similarities across people and produces similar experiences.

Another point to make is the following - imagine everything you are able to think of/imagine/do with your brain. Now think about the same brain having a part of it devoted to come up with things like that, or is 'split-off' from you and just interacts with you... It would have the same capabilities and imagination as you. So it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that the voices can seem real or are uncannily intelligent. Just give it the benefit of the doubt and maybe talk to a psychiatrist/mental health professional and be honest about what you are experiencing, they would be able to help you out! And don't give up if your first doctor disappoints you, a lot of the time it takes several attempts at finding proper treatment.

If you have any question or would like to talk - feel free to write here or message me.

I hope this helps. Good luck!"
Psychosis,f9vv20e,t1_f9vuoko,1575680525.0,"Thanks for the comment! I guess I just hate seeing people who can feel better, get in situations like that because of medication which is trying to help them... Sorry if I made it seem like it happens all the time."
Psychosis,f9vtqyh,t1_f9vss3a,1575679520.0,"P.S. Edited the original post to state 'in some cases' rather than 'in most cases' Don't want to confuse people, just trying to help..."
Psychosis,f9vss3a,t1_f9vp233,1575678769.0,"The thing is, medications play a role in the development of depression... Even though pharmaceutical companies are trying to push drugs like Aripiprazole for depression, down the line, in some people, those drugs could trigger depression or suicidal ideation in people who have never been depressed or suicidal. A lot of people start feeling like they cannot cope and they attribute that to anxiety, life circumstances, depression, inability to cope with hallucinations, etc. They just don't realize that it could be from the medications themselves! Especially in conditions such as schizophrenia, where people are led to believe time and time again that the things they are experiencing are solely due to their condition, leading them to falsely believe there is no way out and the way they start feeling is the way things are going to be forever, since they cannot change their diagnosis. In reality, however, they are a very vulnerable population, which needs to understand that the medications they are on play a huge role in their perception, mood, and perspective on life. Sometimes, long-term administration of antidepressants or antipsychotics has a dramatic effect on the quality of life of people... In my opinion, it is important for them to know, that in circumstances like that, they should be aware of the fact that a lot of medications lead to such states and not everything they experience is due to their condition alone, meaning there is still hope for them and the way they feel can, sometimes, be because of the medications they are on.

The side effects of long-term administration of psychotropic drugs are vastly under-reported and misunderstood!

For example, if you start taking an antipsychotic for a few weeks/months (and for other side effects, years), one of the things you'd notice is how you are not able to communicate verbally and nonverbally as well as you used to... Doctors would usually attribute that to the patient's diagnosed schizophrenia, for example... Also, the way people diagnosed with schizophrenia form loose associations, lack of emotions, poverty of speech. In reality, it's due to the medication for a lot of people and, following its cessation, they regain their ability to communicate, emotions, etc. 

First episode psychosis is supposed to have a dramatic effect on cognition. But I wonder why? In the literature you'd see conflicting information - some (sharing the outdated view) say that certain signs and symptoms are from schizophrenia, whilst others would point to the medication.

Another side effect commonly attributed to schizophrenia is the lack of facial expression and body movement, which, too, can be cause in healthy individuals taking antipsychotic medications..

Yet another one is the disorganized behavior, which there is even a youtube video on! If you observe a patient on antipsychotic medications, they sometimes lose their ability to sense temperature as well, leading them to dress inappropriately for the weather, which was, in said video, described as a symptom of schizophrenia (disorganized behavior)!

Point being, don't underestimate the effects of the medications. In situations of crisis, always have it in mind that the trouble you are having could be due to the medications themselves... I think it is counter productive to keep being 'objective' about 'facts' coming mainly from pharmaceutical companies or from lack of research when it comes to something as serious as suicidal ideation. In cases like that, it is important for people to be aware of the dramatic impact those drugs have on their quality of life and perception...

Disclaimer: I am in no way saying that no medications should be used. In my opinion, they are the best thing we have currently for some conditions, but should always be taken with caution and under observation from a doctor! My opinion is also that we know way too little about them and attribute way too much to the conditions they are aimed at treating, rather than considering them as a possible side effect..."

Psychosis,f9vbtxy,t1_f9lbiay,1575666913.0,"That depends. Depends on whether there are neural adaptations from the medication, or whether some of the active ingredients or metabolic downstream chemicals remain constant after the disruption from the medication... Some medications can cause very rapid and permanent changes, but it depends on the person too, it's not really well understood... Overall, I'd remain positive and not worry about things outside of your control! Remain on the meds for as long as you feel you need them for psychotic symptoms and try to read/watch other peoples' stories so that you see that they are experiencing similar issues like you... That way, you'd be prepared to just ""shrug off""/""disregard"" future psychotic/delusional thinking better... But be aware of the fact that once the brain gets used to not paying attention to some of the hallucinations, new ones appear in different form. Just always have the rule to check whether you're doing something you wouldn't expect or out of the ordinary, that way you'd assess things from time to time, since psychosis lures you in sometimes slowly and without you realizing it it eventually becomes full blown. Identify your signs of entering a psychotic episode and have medications at the ready. Hope this helps!"

Another side effect during withdrawal is restless leg syndrome, but it could also affect the arms (if you don't know what it is, you'd recognize it definitively if you get it) Other side effects which you could expect include eyesight changes, but they come and go... Most side effects appear for a few hours and then disappear, only to reappear later at seemingly random intervals.. Important thing is to remember that they would go away! Sometimes quicker than taking a dose of antipsychotics to alleviate them.. Side effects depend on the levels of neurotransmitters, it's not about having too much or too little, it's about passing through certain levels of them whilst the brain regenerates/gets used to working without the medication...

Psychosis,f9l5306,t3_e5p5fk,1575414640.0,"Generally speaking, yes, until you get stabilized. It depends on the person. As soon as the person has a strong belief system and is ready to be cautious about future episodes, the medications should be stopped. Psychotherapy by a skilled (not always the case) professional is very helpful (but only after the person has been stabilized) if done correctly and could dramatically reduce the need for future use of medication.

It is important to share everything and be honest about your beliefs with your psychotherapist and mental helath team in order for treatment to be effective.

Prolonged use of medications alters the brain and could lead to relapses caused solely by the alteration of neurotransmitter levels the brain gets accustomed to by the prolonged (years) administration of antipsychotic medications, thus rendering the person dependent on using the medication."
Psychosis,f9l46aw,t3_e5ho80,1575414036.0,"A lot of it is due to medications or the aftermath of them, which is sometimes permanent. For example, dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is vital for motivation. When you use antipsychotics, they alter its levels and could, hypothetically, lead to a profound lack of motivation. An important point to know is that it isn't about dopamine being really high or really low, it's about having the ""right amount"" of it in the brain. Same goes for serotonin, which is, shamefully, altered by some antipsychotic medications as well. This is why you might experience hallucinations or a worsening of symptoms on higher and lower doses of medication, but not on a middle one, it's all about balance and almost no psychiatrists undestand that. A bit controversial but this is my explanation for a lot of it, I've seen it a lot."
