But. No; I don’t think you’re wrong for regretting having kids. As someone who adores children; I know If I had one right now; it would destroy my life. I would regret it; there are too many things to do right now, with too little time and money to do it with.  Not everyone wants to be a parent, and that’s okay. 

I think as long as you still love your children and you don’t let it get between you and them; you’re fine. 

Just make sure you refute everything your wife tries to use against you with them. Show them the love you can, because as someone who’s seen toxic house holds using the kids as a pawn piece; it doesn’t go well mentally for the kid.

I’ve been in your shoes and have thought the same things. Take a deep breath. I want you know that it’s okay that you’re having these feelings, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. We all have hard times, some times people like us feel it harder than others. That’s okay too, it’s normal. 

I do advise that you open up to a counselor or a trusted adult at your school or family, or friends family even. It’s not a bad thing to get help and support if you need it. Because things do get better, I know it doesn’t seem like it right now, but they do.

I get why you’re upset. But I do think you need to relent a little bit on him.... Especially for him not being able to be around when going through rehab and trying to bond with your parents again.

I’d just suggest stop putting so much effort into it. If he finds the ability to make more time for the family, let him in. 

Some of us are just very busy people. Mentally and physically. Not everyone has the mental energy to keep everyone connected and close all the time. And even though he has been clean; it doesn’t mean mentally there wasn’t or isn’t something going on...

I still get texts from my Abuser 4+ years later, with them trying to act all buddy buddy. With the weird little emojis, and like almost nothing has happened: I’ve been physically sent mutual “friends” trying to ask for them what happened, etc. 

I don’t respond to my Abuser. I’ve never gotten a serious sorry or admittance to what they did- which I don’t expect- but either way, it doesn’t change the past. Same kind of goes for the people who they’ve sent out on me. 

 I don’t want to ever be put in the mindset that they put me into. When my mental health is low, a lot of what they did still can get in my head.

therapy,f2z0mzc,t3_dell2j,1570503122.0,"Hey there. 

I can’t say I was in the same situation as you are at your age, but I did have parents who weren’t supportive of getting me therapy...

You’re not wrong in wanting to get help. It can be an intimidating thing, but it can really help... Especially if you’ve had the thought of doing some more extreme things. Some parents just don’t want to believe their child is going through with things that aren’t physical. My Father used to be in the psychology field and has never wanted to accept my own depression or anxiety. 

What you’re parents are doing to you is very extreme, and very wrong. I’d agree with the others and get evidence of it. Personally, I’d suggest leaving the household ASAP. That isn’t a very safe situation to be in.... I’m sorry you have to go through with that, my friend. 
 
But from someone who is 20, and has had many battles with these thoughts; it does get better. You’re not crazy, you’re not weird. You’re not stupid. 

The human brain is complex; some things that we go through might not affect some people, some it might have some serious impacts and it may in various different ways person to person. But that is normal, becasue we are all different. 

Keep strong and hold in there. If you needed to hear this today; you are important, you are worth it. 

If there is an option at your school; I’d suggest reaching out for a counselor, or see if the school may have discreet options for you. Maybe even tell them what is occurring at home, if you feel comfortable with that.

I don’t know if you’ll see my message, but I’ll reply anyways.

I wonder if it would be worth it to have her switch over to a community college for a short while? So she can take a whirl at LA before fully diving into it? It might ease the money tensions... 

I’m not sure how you brought it up with her, but maybe try to sit down with her again and have a calm conversation. Say you’re willing to support her, you just want to know what sparked the sudden interest in changing majors. 

Do take note, it’s best that she decided this now of course, rather than a few years in. College courses are a lot different from High School. And First semester to first year is often just the student trying to figure it out. High School- rarely actually prepares us for college. Mainly just tests us. 

As a community college student; I’ve attended for three years- and actually will a fourth. But that’s becasue I’m going for photography and I’ve been working for the photo department for over a year now. My prof/boss is honestly the smartest dude I know (All the older professors are stunned) and I’ve trusted him more than flying off to a Arts School right away. I’m going to transfer after next year, but getting to go to a community college that has the best arts department out of the others has improved my life so much. 

But yeah, try to sit down with her again. Maybe have a nice dinner, parent-child bonding night and try again with the conversation. Just make sure she knows you want the best for her and are willing to help, just want to her to be confident in her choice."

When you’re able to work, find a job that you like and work hard at. Save that cash you get. It’ll add up fast.

That night I ended up in a fight with my parents, with them telling me I couldn’t be depressed. I had a roof over my head. 

My parents were never emotional, so I never felt comfortable before talking with them, so this dead bolted the door shut completely. I already had abusive friends my whole life, so that wasn’t an option either. 

So I quickly learned to shut my trap. I’ve got healthy friends now; people I consider my family. But most of them don’t understand how hard it is to make that sudden change of getting that ability finally to talk and put it into words out loud. No matter how much you trust them.

I slept in my Mom’s bed a few months ago, because our oldest family dog passed away and I spent until the early hours of the morning with our Chihuahua because she was hurt by it. I passed out and ended up staying the night in there. 

The cuddling stopped when I was pretty young. My parents don’t really like to hug much or show too much emotion. I don’t remember the last time I got an “I love you” from them. I had a lot going on in High School; I still do. And I don’t feel like I can open up to them.

For an example; a group of my best mates and I had a hotel party together last weekend. My group mainly consists of men. My partner knows this. But he also knows that I’m loyal, I dont have any temptation to cheat. 

A friend who is also in a long distance and I who am as well, shared a room together.

You’ll probably see me as a old lady a bit haha, but hear me out. 

Gosh. The drama you kids have to deal with is insane.  Not that there wasn’t crazy stuff during my day at your age; but social media wasn’t a thing really. This is some High School level stuff....

 It anyways; I think your friend is insane to want a kid that young, and  I think her Boyfriend is a creep. They are both extremely wrong to want a kid right now.

 Assuming you’re in the US; her ‘man’ can barely legally work. So unless he is rich; ....where are they going to find the money? 2, While yes, she may be able to have a kid; it seriously is not healthy on the body at that age to bear a child. 

3. Just wtf? 

I think it’s very mature of you though to leave a group that brings you stress. It’s hard at your age. But as 20 year old here; there will be plenty of times where you have to care for yourself first. And if that is getting rid of toxic friends; so be it. It’s okay not to be friends with every class mate: just don’t be a jerk, ya know? As long as you aren’t demeaning anyone or bullying, etc. live life. Take care of yourself. It’s okay not to support certain choices and it’s okay not to want to a part of something. 

I’ll admit hearing this from someone your age for me, is scary. I’m apart of the older cousins on both sides, and my parents are older too. I have my closest cousins who are your age. It’s terrifying to think that this is what they may get involved in. Much less as an adult; it’s hard to figure out life. I couldn’t imagine trying to add that on so early too. I’m someone who does like children; but I fully believe if you’re going to try to have them, you should be giving them your best."

All of our dogs in my life have been taught “Bed times”. They understand when it is appropriate to look out the window and yap if they must, and when it’s time for the house to wind down and sleep. 

The only time that is possibly changed is when someone is expected to come home or visit.

mentalhealth,excg6uj,t3_cs40za,1566149993.0,"My oldest Uncle took his life when my mother and her siblings were fairly young. To my knowledge this was after my Grandfather passed early on. He had problems as a child; my Grandmother wasn’t abusive in any way, she just didn’t know how to handle kids very well. They were a bit intimidating for her until they were older. So my Grandfather and the rest of the European side of the family often took rein. His way to cope with my Grandfather’s death went to just doing weed to doing some heavier stuff. And not being able to find a different way to cope- yet again there was a much heavier stigma around mental health issues... 

Another hand; my cousin’s wife; her sisters boyfriend (another part of our family) wrote to her before he did it; saying it wasn’t her fault and he just could take his own mind any longer; his family continues to blame her after... 20 years? 

As someone who also has and is going through some extreme depression and PTSD;

It’s hard to learn how to talk to the people around about your problems; even if you are extremely close to them and have had a good relationship. Depression, anxiety, and any other related issue tend to make you feel alone in a full room so to speak. You start randomly not being able to trust your loved ones and worry.

Its kind of being lost at sea; you might have food and materials on your boat, and the coast guards are searching for you; your friends and family know you’re lost; but it’s been days and days since you’ve seen land or could get anywhere. You try to debate if you should swim for it; where the sharks are and waves; or if you should just give up; because that would be less scary. 

Understand it’s not your fault. It’s nobody’s. Don’t get angry at anyone, just try to be there for the others who are affected and talk your feelings out. Also get a therapist. 

It wasn’t to get at you all. Some times our demons look bigger and scarier than they really are; they don’t look like we can fight them, and often come to us when we are alone. They will vanish when we have company; so why bring it up and look crazy? 

Perhaps it wasn’t the correct therapy, maybe it triggered something. Maybe it was money, or maybe he had just been dealing with something for way too long and didn’t think he could fix it at this point."

dating_advice,ewxpi96,t3_cqmrn0,1565865285.0,"Okay... since the first post was removed; I gave my POed advice, and while I do still stand by it.... here, as someone who has been abused (for the newbies on this post, I consider cheating emotional abuse). Let me tell you what I think you should do.

If you are completely serious that you love this girl and you want to change; 

If you apologize; don’t just cut the line at “I’m trying to change” and then act all buddy buddy. Sincerely apologize and admit to exactly what you did wrong, so she can know that you know how you messed up. Say exactly what you did. Don’t cut corners.

Don’t push her, don’t expect her to come back. Give her time and let her set the pace. If cheating is really a bit issue with you; I do think you should seek therapy. For future relationships, and cut off ties with your ex if it makes it that tempting to you. If you really must, maybe monogamy isn’t for you. 

It make not seem like it, but you cheating on her can really ruin self esteem and probably made her feel like she isn’t worth while to people. Coming from somewhere; where I was cheated on, I was both emotionally and physically abused from someone I loved. This starting to tear at after I finally left. I dealt with this for five full years and it’s been three since I left. 

I think for you continuing to stay friends with your ex after you cheated so many times; to me that would just feel like a rub in the face and saying “I might go do it again”. Even if that’s not how you meant it; that is how it can make someone feel. That is why you are getting so much harsh words towards you; you just have to understand how it looks in your mind is not how others see it. 

I can tell you’re not going to respond to hard criticism... okay. 

I do think you need to let her go; but I also do think you should give her a full on apology. But if she does not want to see you or do anything with you; let it go before you get in trouble."

I started mine off when I was a year older than you, my partner was 21 and graduating from our shared campus. It was a shared liking of eachother the moment we met. We decided to just be FWB for about a year and a half and friends since we were both very into our studies and careers- we still both are two years later. We went for this route because I’d gotten my first job and was out constantly, and I had recently gotten out of an abusive relationship and wasn’t ready to go back into another relationship just yet. 

We finally admitted to our feelings about six months ago and are slowing down for eachother a bit. I now work on my campus for my professor in a job I wanted to come back to get after I finished my studies. And he’s taking a break from morning classes at least to spend time. We are extremely mature and communicate a ton with eachother about how we feel and what we want. We work with our distance. 

I can’t say this for most men or most people your age.... Most just want sex. And not every story leads to what me and my partner have had. It usually doesn’t.

As someone who went through some of the same things, even with the same sex (which was the main reason for my own lack of self confidence), I can definitely understand that. I wouldn’t see the harm, as long as she comfortable with it, to try to open that door into that talk. And see if there’s anything to do as her partner to help these things. If there are certain things she doesn’t want to speak about right away, don’t get offended, just give her the time to sort out her own thoughts and how she might want to bring up things.

The fact that she is hopeful and wants to try it, I think is a step in the right direction though. 

Everyone’s different of course, but for me the first few times were just kind of awkward with my partner, but nothing that made me physically feel uncomfortable. In all reality, it shouldn’t feel painful or anything of the sort for a woman. If it does; it could be lack of preparation or there might be a physical condition that can make intercourse painful, wether is the condition itself or something related to PCOS (closely related, different symptoms though- pardon me for forgetting the name atm). Most of the time the pain is a myth to get people not to do things of course. 

What I did before my partner and I got sexually active; I bought myself a jackrabbit to be honest so I could get more comfortable with the idea. While I never expressed my doubts, I think he did notice.... so after the first time or so, he turned off the lights, put a candle or two around and just let me mainly take the ropes, while giving me some slight guidance. It was all and still is: all compliments and making sure everything’s good. We still have problems here and there so to speak, so I often will use my toy to make things go smoother. Sorry for the description, but it’s sort of the best way I can explain it. 

If she is having issues from her past, I would definitely suggest therapy, maybe even couples therapy to help? There’s also therapy for sexual issues as well. Just from someone who’s lately been haunted by their own past which can make me struggle at times; even in things that aren’t connected."

Heck, my old best friends and I stopped talking for about two years; we all got busy and were in separate states; but I hit them up and we met up to talk. Same went with my childhood best friend who moved back after 10 years; we picked right back up. 

I know you’re about to say this is over; and I don’t blame you; it can hurt a lot. But why don’t you message him or his wife to ask what’s up? Just to see what the deal is? Communication is key in any relationship. 

I say no one’s the A hole, just because I’ve been at places where I couldn’t push myself to really talk to too many people or vise versa. Sometimes we just have very busy points in our lives. And someone might have more going on than we know. 

My mother is still friends with her high school best friends, they don’t talk much at all since they all have families; maybe once a year, a few more with one because she cuts our hair. But they still remember eachother fondly. 

I wish you the best dude. Good luck."

First off, congratulations. I’d talk to her on what makes her so afraid of things. Like is she scared it going to hurt? 

I’d also suggest, if she doesn’t. To masturbate. To get to know her own body and what she likes. That it’s not shameful in anyway. If she’s interested, maybe see if she’ll let you buy her a vibrator or similar. 

Slow steps of course, but I’m sure things will work out. 

You’re a good guy. It’s nice to see someone who has so much patience now a days."
sex,ewl032h,t3_copsot,1565500369.0,"Same! 

Like I love the feel, but rarely feel like I’m going to get there. For me it’s mainly clitoral. Could try to hint him on to it or try adding a vibrator to the bed room? 

I haven’t tried it yet, but I’ve heard kegals can help too. Wether it’s with silicone balls or just pelvic muscle flexing."
sex,ewkzt0x,t3_coqcbg,1565500072.0,"Pee after sex is a bit one. Over the years, my partner and I have become less worried about things, but we usually shower and help eachother clean up after things get done. I’ve started to bring baby wipes just in case too."
sex,ewkzl7g,t3_coqur5,1565499841.0,"You won’t get laughed at. Since men can pretty much st any point in their life after puberty make a child, I think at any age after it is acceptable to want to get one done. 

Of course I’d just warn, because in the rare case; they don’t always go as planned. If you’re worried for the next few weeks after; you could always try spermicide if you both aren’t allergic!"
sex,ewkzdp1,t3_corkzj,1565499625.0,"As a female, with depression.... I think this is most definitely a thing. 

I have other medications too which can affect this time to time, but I’ve definitely had some odd phases. Where I only went to get off because I can’t do anything else, or it’s what gives me dopamine. Then there will be times that there’s just nothing... I don’t have a libido, I don’t feel a lot a pleasure, etc.

Sometimes it’s actually when I’m in one of my best moods. Brains and bodies are weird."
