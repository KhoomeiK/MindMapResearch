mentalhealth,fllz33o,t3_fplncz,1585270841.0,It's all about perspective! I'm pushing forty and feel like my life has just begun. Don't bound yourself to age and especially don't compare yourself to other people. I did a lot of that during my twenties. Now I look at those people's lives and the majority of them are divorced  and/or starting over with new careers. Everyone has their own path. Just do what makes YOU happy.
spirituality,flitbap,t1_fli7m31,1585190212.0,"I am a NDE and I could have wrote that myself. The only part I'm not clear on yet is the where,when,why and how does reincarnation happen. I also feel like I should know this answer, so maybe one day it will come to me. I had a taste of the other side and still experience strong feelings that I can only attribute to what happened to me. It's not a what if? Feeling. It's a knowing."

Odsp,fk2szuy,t3_fg3guz,1583808460.0,"You need your health card and your id #. Most dentists should accept odsp now. I just had my teeth cleaned and a long overdue filling. I put if off due to being kind of ashamed but as it turned out, I really didn't need to be and the dentists office took care of everything. Just call around. It's such a great feeling to not have to worry about my teeth!!"

 A friend of mine shit her pants in a car stuck in a traffic jam on a date. Long story short, she ended up marrying the man. Who,  by the way, also would sleep walk and piss in random places in their house everytime he drank beer. üòÜ"
mentalhealth,fhqw3wu,t1_fhpz1ve,1581812528.0,"Well that blows. I'm from Canada and there are so many resources for kids like you. 1-800-668-6868 is a kids help line here. It might make you more comfortable calling seeing as you live in another country. It's very discrete, and I'm sure they could help you find free resources wherever you're from. The fact that you have recognised these symptoms in yourself and are looking for advice speaks volumes. Being self aware is a great quality and you have your whole life ahead of you!!! I know from my own experience that you can take control of your life and learn to ignore your own brain when it's being a fucking asshole. Happiness does exist."
mentalhealth,fhoowad,t1_fho6px4,1581768265.0,This is hard for me to hear. You are so young. I know of programs where I'm from where you don't need consent. Are you fortunate enough to live where there's free health care?
mentalhealth,fho5czl,t1_fho4p7i,1581742006.0,Even Hitler loved animals.
mentalhealth,fho5baa,t1_fho2tou,1581741961.0,If I were you I'd go right now! Don't let yourself hurt yourself any longer. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY DO IT BEFORE YOU HURT ANOTHER ANIMAL. As I'm sure you're aware it can be a prelude to humans. I can justify hurting a human. Not an animal!!
mentalhealth,fho4p7i,t1_fho2tou,1581741378.0,"Well I understand a few of those things. Not hurting animals. Geez. Stop that now. Anyways, you are not here for that. I highly suggest you get a psychiatrist before you end up in JAIL!! You won't get the help you deserve in there. I'm not sure where you're from, but I can tell you no matter where you go, privacy is an issue. I'm a big believer in you create your own reality so if you have a good sense oh humour and at least try to be a pleasant person whom is there for the right reasons, it can actually be pretty rewarding. Don't expect to be ' fixed' right away. It took me years of struggling and I even succeeded at dying once a little. No joke. Ended up in a coma for two weeks. If you do end up in inpatient treatment I'll give you a tip. Be nice to the nurses. It will make your life so much easier and they really appreciate it. I'd always end up not liking at least one of them just to keep things interesting."
Empaths,fho37p1,t3_f410l1,1581739997.0,"I'm still figuring this shit out, but what I do is visualize absorbing the negative energy and then filling myself with sparkly white light. I usually start with my head an visualize the white light just squishing all the negative energy out. Then when I'm done, it's like I feel clean and more open to the positive energy around me. I feel there's no escape from the negative, I just figured out a way for me to handle it. :)"

They all said the same thing, it only happens when their under massive amounts of stress. And don't be embarrassed! My other guy friend once pissed in his mothers fridge, my cousin pissed down his stairs. All of them while sleep walking. You are not alone!!! I (35f) once peed in a laundry basket when I had a fever. I could have sworn it was a toilet!!!"

Empaths,fgnowhc,t3_ezbxjt,1580949659.0,I am so glad you asked this. I have also been toying with this thought and you have worded it perfectly. What I don't understand is how I know something when I'm not even there.
