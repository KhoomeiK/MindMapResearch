schizophrenia,f7wctz8,t3_dxu6th,1574032001.0,It's possible it was a factor I also did alot of psychedelics and have SZA
schizophrenia,f7waa7k,t3_dxjx3m,1574031302.0,I dont do anything for fun besides read manga and browse the internet on my phone.

schizophrenia,ex35xny,t3_cra0zm,1565980601.0,"Keep looking for work that you can tolerate doing full time. Make money, buy stuff you like and upgrade your life style. That's the best advice I can give you as I am sza."
schizophrenia,ex35o5r,t3_cr5s8s,1565980492.0,"I'm a good 5. 

The only thing normal is I work full time and I put on my normie mask at work.

But once i get home i go full r*****. I become absolutely lazy and i dont have much of a social life outside of family gatherings. I'm also muslim so add to the mix, I cant participate in alot of ""recreational"" activities."
