AmItheAsshole,fp2kkw7,t3_gaw4yl,1588263356.0,"My older sister was jealous of the time my mom gave me during mt pregnancy except it was backwards. She was married, 25 years old, financially stable and their daughter was planned. 
Fast forward 12 years to my pregnancy. I was 20, single, struggling financially, and extremely depressed. My mom went to almost every appointment, set up my baby shower, helped me file for child support, and even let me stay with her so she could help me after I had my baby. She then babysat my son for me so I could work or even have some alone time. 

Now he's 7 and he's actually at her house right now. My sisters daughter is 15 now and she also has a 3 year old boy. My mom still didn't do much for my sister for her son because she's still married and stable but she just doesn't understand that I NEEDED our mom and every little bit of help she offered. My sister lives about an hour from my mom, works from home and never goes out or does anything and doesn't need a babysitter but I work 6 days a week with 2 jobs and I live about 15 minutes from my mom. She just thinks I'm being favored but I'm actually just struggling more."

I am currently in a relationship that I absolutely loathe (was amazing for the first 2 months). I got myself into a situation that I can't escape because of finances. I gained weight and I'm more in debt than I ever have been, I'm more unhappy, more anxious, more stressed, more annoyed than I ever have been. I have recently started dieting and exercising and finally seeing results after months of being overweight and unhappy which happened after getting into this relationship. I'm getting myself prepared to end this relationship and become financially stable and independent again. 


I truly don't believe I was meant to be codependent or live with other people. I don't like sharing my personal space, I'm not a cuddler, I'm a neat freak and most other people are not, I enjoy my silence and my stress turns into arguments. Although I'm mostly introverted, I really miss being able to go out and have fun and be flirtatious and maybe even take someone home once in a while. I was single for 5 years and I did have my lonely moments but in reality, I was so much happier and healthier.


 This was kind of just a vent session for me but I really hope somebody can take this information and learn and to love themselves whether you are going through a break up or just feeling lonely."

AmItheAsshole,fg79w8s,t3_ex7na8,1580587417.0,"NTA. That's bullshit. 

Similar story: My cousin (sarah*) was homeless with a baby and already had her other 2 taken from her custody.  I felt bad for this baby and let her and the baby stay with me in my small apartment. I woke up quite a few times to a screaming baby and Sarah nowhere to be found. She would wait until I went to bed then leave without asking or even telling me. No notes, no texts, nothing. I ONLY let her stay because of her baby's safety. 

One morning I was getting up and ready for work and I could hear baby screaming in the living room. This was probably 8:30am. Sarah wasn't there and I HAD to go to work. She wouldn't answer her phone and I even contacted some people she knew to find out where she was and no one knew. I had no choice to but call my work and explain this to them and thankfully they were more understanding than angry. She finally stumbled home around noon from some guys house who lived about 2 blocks away. 

I found out that she had replaced ALL of my alcohol bottles with water (I didn't drink much so a couple bottles were basically a 3 month supply to me) so I got her into a homeless shelter for women and kids. 

Fast forward 3 years later and she's sober, happy, has her own home and has her children back."

My fiance at the time and I weren't on good terms and weren't living together but didn't call off the relationship completely. I didn't want to wear my ring so I put the ring back in the ring box and put it in a specific, safe drawer where only I knew about it. About 2 weeks passed and a friend of mine came over and she brought a couple other girls with her that she knew do wer could all hang out. They never left the couch while they were there and were only in my house for about 45 minutes. 

A couple days after that I went to find my ring to put it back on after reconciling with the fiance. It was nowhere to be found. I searched every drawer in the entire house and couldn't find it. I even asked my friend if she could somehow bring me to the other girls' house so I could look around in case they took it even though I literally watched them sitting in my couch the entire time and watched them leave. I also had my friend help me look for it in my house.


It wasn't there but I wasn't convinced. I finally broke down and told my fiance at the time that I lost it. I told him where I put it and he also searched the entire house to no avail. I checked the drawer several times a day and still nothing. 


I bought a whole new ring. I went to the same jeweler and bought the exact same ring for a few hundred dollars. A month went by with no good news but I wasn't checking very often since I gave up hope and had a replacement. I was rearranging some furniture and decided to clean out some drawers and organize them and THERE IT WAS. In the box, in the drawer, in my house, exactly where I placed it. I had two of the same ring. Both had an imperfection in the band from resizing. It gave me chills. We broke up for good about 2 months after that."
