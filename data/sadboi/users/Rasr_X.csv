PrequelMemes,f10aq7x,t1_f1098wq,1569109805.0,"Yup made my account a year ago but I’m new to this subreddit. Up until 2 weeks ago, the only meme subreddit I knew about what r/memeeconomy and I can honestly say that this subreddit has been the highlight of my feed since then. I apologize if I upset anybody with this meme I genuinely thought it was original. Thank you for visiting my profile though 👍👍

I had a bad experience with reddit when I first created this account and only have been using it frequently for a little more than a month so if anybody has reddit tips that’d be great cause I’m still figuring it all out."

RocketLeague,ezxt5eh,t1_ezxt1ak,1568249008.0,Makes sense. My Diamond and Champ friends won’t let me play competitive with them for that exact reason hahaha
RocketLeague,ezxsryo,t1_ezxsjgr,1568248730.0,Thanks! I was freaking out a few days ago about it actually but I went all the way to Gold3 and determined that getting mad because I wasn’t where I “should” be was what was really hurting me. I’m playing much better now and trying to not care about my rank but am still finding that Plat1 competition is much harder than I remember it being.
