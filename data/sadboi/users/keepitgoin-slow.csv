I’m not involved in anything sus lol so I’m more concerned about not having employers, etc. find this stuff - which reddit is a great place for since it’s anonymous. I know others could still access it, but it’s been a good emotional outlet for me, and the people in my life are all aware of this stuff anyway. I really do appreciate the reminder though, since my personal information is very valuable to me."

relationships,fq5jz6e,t3_ggvzmn,1589108301.0,"The lying is a huge red flag. Porn addiction is a very real problem, but he’s an adult and knows that what he’s doing is wrong. Have a very serious conversation about this with him - let him know it hurts you, and be as honest as you can. If he quits and the trust is still there, great! If you catch him lying about it in the future, I would very very strongly reconsider this relationship."
relationships,fq5jhwr,t3_ggx84q,1589107788.0,"I’ve been in your position and made the mistake of staying with him (for several years). He became sexually and emotionally abusive, and lied and hid the porn the whole time no matter how many times I tried to put my foot down (and it was a lot!!)  

I also struggle with EDs and know how tough a bf’s porn addiction can make the situation. Honestly hell.   

Light at the end of the tunnel: I’m now with someone who makes me feel safe and loved, inspires me to go after my goals instead of dragging me down, and!! Isn’t addicted to porn !!  

I guess what I really want you to know is that that’s not how a partner is supposed to treat you. Being in a similar situation, at the time I really believed that was just “how men were” and that I was getting the best I could. That’s a straight up lie.   

There are compassionate, loving, emotionally  intelligent men out there (lmao ik, but for real!!)   

You deserve to be with someone you’re compatible with and can truly trust. I really hope you end up breaking up with him, it’ll hurt for a while, but I promise you that you will be better off.  

Also consider checking out r/codependency, it helped me out a lot."

OrthodoxChristianity,fpu4yn9,t1_fptvpns,1588904766.0,God is God no matter what words we use to describe him. He doesn’t change.
OrthodoxChristianity,fptt35k,t3_gfhn3w,1588897712.0,"Your spirituality is your own. Ultimately there is no gender, just souls. I also grew up Orthodox, and distanced myself due to my bisexuality (definitely not as difficult as being trans but was still enough to make me feel unwelcome).   

What I can say, and know in my heart, is that God is for everyone. God sees your soul, and knows you in your entirety. Personally, I see any faith tradition as a stepping stone to ultimate God, spirit, balance, etc. What’s worked for me is taking parts of each tradition that feel the most true, or that are the most truly helpful for me and my relationship with God, without putting too many rules on it. 

For example, I still keep icons, wear a cross, and say the Creed/Lord’s Prayer regularly. I also like to read Orthodox philosophy and take what is helpful to me and my own journey. Merging Orthodoxy with Buddhism, Taoism and Kaballah has really worked for me. At the end of the day, they’re all telling the same story and they can all lead you to God. Your relationship with God is your own, not anyone else’s. 

That being said, I know how important a spiritual community can be. I would recommend doing research on Orthodox Churches in your area and seeing if any of them speak to you. Visit a couple, and see if any of them feels like home. Take your time, listen to yourself. 

I truly wish you the best on this journey, and hope you find something that can enrich your life and give you the spiritual comfort, knowledge, community, etc. that you’re looking for:)"

But yeah, that’s a good reminder on not assigning too much to it. Not shitty at all - I’m definitely an over-thinker, and try to put “truth” into a box sometimes.

I think I’m leaning more towards officially retiring around 55, and I think saving 30k would be very reasonable for the lifestyle I’d like to live.  I’m definitely growing to love CS, so I don’t think I’d mind a few extra years in the field. 

Have you found that a degree is essential in landing higher paying jobs? I’m also pretty terrified of debt, so that’s really only a route I’d go if it’s absolutely necessary."

financialindependence,fo8irox,t3_g4nebk,1587597359.0,"Hey, I’m super new to this and finance is something I know very little about. I took AP econ in high school but skirted by with Cs and only retained a little - so that’s the extent of my knowledge. I am very much a self-learner though, so I mostly need info on where to start down my rabbit holes lol.

20/Portland  
-Be well off - have enough to travel, own a house, decent car, etc. Not planning on having kids  

-I’d love to be able to work part-time by 40-45, and out of the game by 55  

-I have my HS Diploma, and about 1.5 years of college credits, but ended up dropping out. For now, I’m focused on moving out of my parent’s house and starting a life.   

-I’ve been working a lot of odd jobs - petitioning, child care, service industry, photography, etc. mostly seasonal. I’m looking to get into an entry level job that pays decently well for a few years just to allow me to move out/support myself, but obviously Covid has put that on hold. I’m pretty sure I’m going to qualify for about $600 weekly from unemployment and am planning on saving almost all of that.   

-I’m currently teaching myself how to code (I have a pretty decent hold on HTML5 and CSS, and just started JavaScript) and would love to be a completely or mostly self-taught programmer within a few years. Not sure if I want to go into front end web development or software engineering yet, but these are the positions that are most interesting to me. I’m considering college for this, but really only if it proves necessary to land a job, and would like to teach myself as much as I can beforehand.   

-I have about $10,000 in savings that I want to save for either going back to school, code camp if that’s a route I choose to go, or if neither of those end up happening either towards a downpayment on a house or to get into investing after my career is stable.   

-No debt   

-I struggle with mental illness, particularly ADHD and CPTSD, which has made keeping a job difficult in the past. I’m highly motivated and can be pretty smart and a quick learner when I’m focused, so it’s really been more a matter of finding something that’s a good fit. Something more independent and skill-based (and interesting) like coding have proven to work pretty well for me so far, at least in the learning process. I definitely lean more towards self-employment type stuff, but I’m not sure how this would work in the programming world.   

-I currently live at home with my parents, who are not well off at all. If I do end up making a pretty hefty salary later, it would be important to me to give back to them by helping to pay off my mom’s student loans, their mortgage, etc. I also have a grandmother who owns 10+ properties and will likely inherit either a large sum of money or property when she passes (likely within the next 10 years).    

My main questions are:  
-What should I look into to get started?  
-What’s the best advice you could give to someone just starting out?  
-What are some investing options for someone still trying to build wealth/become financially secure? (I’m not looking for high-risk investments at this point since I really only have about $500 in my checking)  
-Is self-taught coding worth it, or would school be a better choice down the road? (For anyone in the programming industry)  

And just any thoughts/advice on my current financial situation (I know it’s not great lol) that come up. Thanks for reading, I really appreciate any input."

unpopularopinion,fmndwde,t1_fmnaswh,1586223856.0,"A lot of people weren’t given the correct response (enough attention/validation) as kids when they were upset and now overcompensate as a response. We all have a need to be seen, comforted, and loved. If you were never shown how to properly get that, this is what sometimes happens. 

I agree that it’s not a good way to ask for support but I think people put too much judgement on these kinds of people. I think there’s something devastatingly sad about someone who feels the need to go to those lengths to feel like anyone cares about them. It’s kind of tragic."

I hate that fishing stuff and it feels really shallow. But also part of being good to the people you care about is providing reassurance to them when they ask for it. I like it better when it’s framed as “hey i’ve been feeling kind of down about my abilities/appearance/etc, can you say a few words of affirmation to help me out of these negative thought patterns?” instead of just straight passive aggression and fishing. It states the need clearly and maybe it’s still not totally genuine to the moment for you, but you probably believe that SO/friend/etc IS. a great, funny, cool person anyway so it’s still the truth, yknow? I’m also wildly independent so I would rather suffer in silence than ask someone else to bring me out of something like that but ... it can absolutely be a healthy thing to do to snap people out of bad moods, etc. I’m personally working on allowing myself to accept help from others, and this is a way that people can help other people (within reason ofc)

Hopefully that made sense but basically just wanted to say that neither side is an awful person in a situation like this, and that reassurance is not inherently unhealthy or wrong."

BPD,fk5pkrr,t1_fk5kjvk,1583885363.0,"Yes of course anyone is allowed to post here - but the key words in there are “kind, empathetic, respectful, and non-judgmental”. Anyone is allowed to post, but this is one of the few real “safe spaces” for people with BPD to be honest and feel supported. 

If you are seeking support from a damaging past relationship with someone with BPD, you can technically post about it here without “getting in trouble” but don’t expect a lot of support. Posts like that generally trigger panic, trauma, and shame responses from people with BPD and I personally had a panic attack from reading your comment. Most of us live in a constant state of very extreme shame, and it’s nice to have a place where we aren’t berated with stuff that makes us feel worse. 

Posts that generalize people with BPD come off as very judgmental, and often invalidating of all the work that many of put in everyday to be the best that we can be. It’s hurtful, and while your post won’t be removed or anything like that - the empathetic thing to do would understand that this is not necessarily the place for that kind of sharing. 

I’ve found that r/codependency is a great resource with a very supportive vibe. 

People with BPD are not evil, many of us are in immense pain and are trying so hard to be kind and loving just like anyone else. I hope you understand that this is not an attack, and that I’m just trying to help you understand why posts like that aren’t typically well-received on this sub."

amiugly,fhnqifs,t3_f411hj,1581730956.0,"Tbh i find big noses reallyyyy cute and prefer men with them ... probably bc i’m greek lol and i also think they look much more masculine. Overall a good looking guy 8.5/10, you really have nothing to worry about"
toastme,fhnas4l,t3_f3w8gm,1581724251.0,I feel this so hard!! Life is tough but seriously you’re doing great even being here. Don’t worry about what other people think - it’s YOUR life and you know how hard you’re working. Let yourself feel proud of all the “little things” - they’re the most important imo. You’ve got this - and know that there’s a bunch of strangers on the net who are rooting for you too lol
TrueOffMyChest,fhjxk9w,t1_fhjwqv2,1581658744.0,Im mostly kidding but i’ll try to send u someت

BPDrecovery,fhjucby,t3_f3ktqv,1581655845.0,"I also relate to this - I had a period of about 6 months of this. I was pretty severely dissociated and in a state of derealization. I had a super hard time connecting with anyone in my life and just felt like I was half-tripping most of the time. Also hyper-aware of everything going on around me and in my mind. I’m diagnosed BPD and CPTSD - mine was brought on mostly by diving too deep into trauma stuff too, as well as excessive isolation. 

BUT I came here to say that with time and mostly just not overthinking it, I’ve come back to feeling mostly normal. I’d definitely mention this to a therapist is you have one, but also know that it’ll probably go away with some time so no need to freak yourself out (like I totally did lol) you’re gonna be just fine:)"
amiugly,fhjq6qb,t3_f3lb2n,1581652556.0,You are so pretty! Kind of girl next door meets supermodel vibes - love it:) sending you good vibes and hope you find confidence in yourself soon
Enneagram,fhjii78,t1_fhjgand,1581647048.0,"Yeah, I’ve totally learned so much about myself from this - it’s been pretty crazy to sort of see how other people see me in a way. I haven’t met a 4w3, but I’ve been friends with a 3w4 for years and the dynamics are totally different, although I’m able to relate with both on fairly deep levels - same with my other oldest friend (6w5!) alikes attract i guess lol"

poetry_critics,fhjcbsr,t3_f3jbw2,1581642663.0,"This is nice! I always love a little french in my poems:) that said, i think it might work better in the middle instead of the end. Also liked the word “zombies” in here, i always appreciate words that are a little goofy and abrasive in more serious poems, i think it works well!"
poetry_critics,fhjc454,t3_f3iuay,1581642510.0,"I would change “treasure” to something a little smoother, it feels a little out of place, and I’d also rework the last line - I like this poem, I just think it needs more of a punch at the end

I really enjoyed the rhyme scheme of this poem, also not sure if you’re a Leonard Cohen fan but the sort of chugging rhythm and sensuality reminded me of his stuff. Well done!"

TrueOffMyChest,fhamwd7,t3_f24lxm,1581418713.0,"Thank you. It’s been almost a year exactly since I was admitted to inpatient for extreme suicidal thoughts (if I hadn’t told my mom what was happening and been admitted I would absolutely be dead right now), and pretty much everyone in my life has completely forgotten about it. They all go on about what a loser I’ve been this year, and how I’m not myself and how I haven’t accomplished anything. I’ve been working so hard to get myself into a better mindset and work past the trauma of that, working on feeling safe with myself again, convincing myself that life is worth living every single day. I’m trying to feel like myself again, but I don’t think I’ll ever be the person I was before. So much of our experience is internal, not just external, and I think a lot of people forget that. I’ve been working on completely remodeling my insides and becoming the person I want to be, and it takes so so much hard work and emotional energy. I wish that the people in my life would appreciate that I’ve gotten myself out of a mindset where I (TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!!!!) 

literally thought about stabbing myself in the heart, driving myself off bridges, and fantasizing about ODing or shooting myself EVERY single day until I felt like I had no option but to follow through. I mean - I got OUT of that, and it’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my entire life and I’ve been through some SHIT. 

So, yeah, with the anniversary of that coming up and a lot of people in my life calling me a loser and hopeless lately- this came at a really good time. It feels good to be appreciated and recognized for that. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so so much. It really means the world right now."

As someone who lets their room get to a really, really embarrassing and gross state - I know how hard it is to break out of that and even clean ONE thing ... and you did the whole thing after two years!!! That’s so incredible, and i know i don’t know you but i am so so so proud. That takes serious willpower and is a huge accomplishment. Big congrats"
Existentialism,fglabpg,t1_fgl9y9l,1580887974.0,"Also just read the article - definitely felt every word, i’ve been thinking that way since about 10-11"
Existentialism,fgl9y9l,t3_ez4t5y,1580887517.0,"Yup i was totally a gifted kid - got iq tested out of class all time, was in TAG, got into a special middle school for kids with 99%ile test scores ... now i have pretty much constant existential dread & have had several full-on psychotic breaks from my existentialism. Pretty wild

My boyfriend was also a gifted kid and has gone through a lot of the same stuff, I definitely see a correlation

Edit: also i feel you on the moral structure and job piece - I’ve recently realized i really just want a job that i tolerate and that allows me plenty of time off to live my life (thinking high school teacher or librarian). Moral structure wise - i think it’s just up to us to decide what we are personally okay with doing and what we’re not. I’ve always thought societal structures and laws were kind of silly and pointless, I make my own rules lol;)"
