I went to Norway and Denmark for a study visit. In public people were generally well mannered and polite, the city was clean without trash everywhere, no random nutcases hanging around the bus stops shooting up or doing crazy shit in the street. I felt so much calmer and relaxed. 

When I got back home to work in the U.K. I went to the store to buy food for lunch and this arsehole guy was stood screaming at a woman for refusing to sell him 4 litres of vodka at 10am in the morning. She was stood there non-phased like this is an almost daily occurrence that she’s just had to get used to. That’s when I realised how much I fucking hated it all and how much it was constantly stressing me out. By the end of the year I moved away to the countryside and I’ve not looked back since."

The electrical thing though that’s actually really scary. He could’ve died.

He is wilfully ignorant though but it’s like something BEYOND ignorant. Like it could genuinely be some kind of mental health issue. 
I don’t think he’s doing it to be an arsehole, like he’ll damage himself and feel upset about it on occasions behaving this way when it has no effect on anyone else but him.

I think part of the issue was his parents had money and coddled him for so long he never properly learned how to do stuff for himself, they would actively stop him from doing things like cooking and DIY for example. His Dad would berate him and say he was doing it all wrong and then just did it for him so he never got the chance to learn whereas my parents would berate me for ever needing the slightest bit of help which has caused my own personal set of problems. I’ve felt genuinely uncomfortable in his mother’s house as she’ll regularly scream at him for something like making a sandwich and using the “wrong” plate or not putting the knife back in the correct place etc. Before he met me he was loaded from his self employed job and single so didn’t have any real adult responsibilities he couldn’t pay someone else to take care of. This means adult things like budgeting and managing a house on a low income is quite difficult for him and he recognises this. 

I’ve tried explaining to him the negative consequences I’m suffering because of his behaviour. Occasionally he’ll apologise but other times he is dismissive or just yet again argues the toss and denies it’s happening. We have actually split up over this then got back together after he caused massive problems while we were moving house because he couldn’t handle basic responsibilities.

It starts as them being inconsiderate dickheads and ends with ten sabotaging your life completely. They can’t stand you doing well if it doesn’t somehow make them look good AT ALL. 

Mine started not complimenting me on anything I did, he tried his best to dissuade me from going to university (telling me I wasn’t smart or talented enough) then started actively trying to sabotage me (like starting fights or causing serious  trouble if he knew I had important deadlines). He even went as far as trying to get me evicted when he knew my final year project was due. He made my life such a nightmare I actually had to drop out and repeat the year it was that bad. Eventually my landlord had to step in and throw him out when he refused to leave.  

He once took me to a wedding where all night I was meeting new people. They all complimented me in one way or another: my dress, my hair, told me I was funny after telling a joke to break the ice etc. Mostly people just being kind and polite (because that’s a completely normal way to behave!). It really amplified how little he ever said anything nice to me. 

In fact he seemed to get more and more angry and uncomfortable around other people who were kind to me in anyway. I couldn’t work out why he seemed to be getting so upset. At the end of the evening reception I was concerned so I asked if he was okay? He just started screaming at me and very harshly berated me infront of everyone. He started telling me I wasn’t “as good as his ex wife” and he was ashamed to be seen with me. The other guests were all his friends and acquaintances, I was completely alone. Shocked with suddenly all eyes on me I ran away crying. He later used this to gaslight me saying I’d embarrassed him and was acting hysterical as if he’d done absolutely nothing wrong using the wedding to humiliate me. 

Another fun trick he liked to pull was similar except he’d wait for meaningful and special occasions like this and quietly pull me aside an whisper insults and put downs into my ear so other people couldn’t hear him in the hopes that I’d get upset, act uncomfortable or even better start crying. The aim was for other people to see me upset so he could claim I was acting crazy while he’d put on this calm and collected demeanour as if he’d done nothing wrong.

RedPillWomen,fpdeoin,t3_gcpz5i,1588525515.0,"There’s no shame in starting out a routine with low weights. I tried to get fit lifting but stupidly busted my knee trying to start with weights too heavy for me (I didn’t want to admit my limitations now I’m 36 and obese). I took the lowest weights and started on a simple routine of lifts for women  I’ve seen on YouTube. It’s going okay and I’m building slowly. 

It’s more important to have a good posture and routine than being able to lift heavy straight away."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fn2nyaq,t1_flrtrib,1586596240.0,"The same thing happened to me though my relationship with a 24 year old man turned abusive really fast when he realised I had nowhere to escape to. At first I didn’t see anything wrong, I was flattered someone older had noticed me and was offering me a (supposedly) safe home and food to eat etc. It was a living nightmare but I had no concept of how creepy it was until I got to my 20’s and found out he’d been grooming another 15 year old girl from the school he worked at."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fn2ncb8,t3_fqmzm5,1586595541.0,"I had this problem when I was 12 - 13 and it’s really scary. I used to think telling them “I’m a kid!” Would put them off but it made matters worse. You’ve got no template for that as a child so they know you’re an easy target. When I was a teenager I’d make myself seem smaller and more innocent trying to get them to leave me alone and yet again no no no. 

When I was a bit older and working at a bar there’d be girls working just turned 18 telling me some creepy old guy hitting on them and then being upset because they were trying to be polite (ITS THEIR JOB) but blamed themselves thinking they’d somehow mistakenly given them the come on. I had to go out and deal with these fucking creeps (sometimes getting shit from my boss for not allowing the younger staff to be harassed for the sake of a few pints) and then give the girls a crash course in stone cold bitch face and telling men to fuck off. 

Also I worked at a seasonal event space that was free, designed to attract kids and young teenagers on bank holiday weekends in the city centre. Fake beach, ice rink & German themed market in the winter stuff like that. A big part of my bosses job was to shoo away all the paedophiles that’d turn up to photograph the little kids playing, sometimes in their underwear if it was a hot day. Best the police could do was turn up to move them on but they’d just come back day after day. You wouldn’t believe the amount of times I had parents come up to me and ask (me, a complete stranger with absolutely no vetting or CRB checks, hell they barely gave me an interview!) if it was cool to just leave their kids unsupervised in this crowded play area while they nipped off for a coffee and a spot of shopping. For real people have no idea how many creeps are out there.

Stay safe and fuck politeness. Better you stay alive and unharmed than dead because you kept worrying if you’ve offended someone."

StudentNurse,fmzwjfa,t1_fmzvt31,1586530983.0,"I’ve been a kitchen porter before (not the same I know but another thankless job, story of my life tbh): I’m used to hard work and long hours but I’ve become unfit this past year. The job description says contact with infected patients and moving bodies from A&E to the mortuary. Cleaning wheelchairs and moving soiled linens to the laundry. 

I’ve previously considered working in organ donation, funeral homes so I like to think I’d cope with it but I can’t be sure until I’m in there. I’m wondering if my short stature and comparative  lack of upper body strength will be an issue?  How to deal with corpses if you’ve never seen one and what are employers looking for? Thanks"

AskReddit,fmavpc1,t1_fm9lxeq,1585909686.0,I remember seeing this guy who was nice and all. We had a lot of fun until I realised we’d been drunk the entire time. We decided to have a sober weekend away but he took me to the War Museum on a date. It was so incredibly boring (I mean I’d go by myself and enjoy it but not exactly a fun date for a new couple). Anyway I cracked a joke to lighten the mood in the gas mask exhibit to and he turned to me stony faced and told me sternly “that’s not funny!”. It wasn’t even a spicy joke. Very painful day after that.

RedPillWomen,fljmdp0,t1_flii6mt,1585218796.0,Not everyone can be understood. Some yes but in some cases people have genuine personality problems and it can be dangerous to rationalise their behaviour as if it could be justified in anyway. I believe our human empathy and desire to be kind and understanding can actually inhibit us from moving on in certain cases.
RedPillWomen,fljlt9v,t3_foxc28,1585218114.0,"Hey! This is me all over! I was in a severely abusive relationship. You don’t say what happened (you don’t have to btw) so it’s not really easy to assess the situation. For example there’s a big difference between a relationship that just didn’t work out and someone who put you through emotional abuse and manipulation. 

Often it’s things that happened to us in childhood that can cause the deepest wounds. We play them out in our adult relationships. For me I had to go back and analyse my childhood to fully understand why certain things hurt me so badly as an adult, why I get into relationships with a certain kind of person, why I tend to react to things the way I do etc. 

Yes empathy and forgiveness can be helpful but not always suitable. Some people are genuinely abusive and you didn’t deserve what they did. You don’t have to forgive them you just have to learn to accept it so you can move forward. CBT and positive affirmations can help. Speaking to a therapist online is a good idea (social distancing here actually means I have far better access to therapists and counsellors as it’s all going through the Internet now!).

You have my upmost sympathy for what you’re going through and I really hope it changes for the better."
