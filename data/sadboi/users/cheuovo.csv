UofT,fhgk0tw,t3_f334fe,1581569278.0,"If I remember correctly, my avg was a 93 or 94. Like others have said, I think the supplementary was what made me stand out. I had to write a piece about this image they chose, and because I do creative writing I wrote a short story. I guess that was different!"

HistoryMemes,f6nr8l8,t3_ds1ko8,1572998058.0,"Another example of this type of protection granted by Hitler is Ernst Moritz Hess, who was Hitler's commanding officer for some time during world war one. Ernst was classified as a ""full-blooded Jew""   
under the Nuremberg Laws, but was offered certain concessions after sending a petition to Hitler. This protection only lasted until 1941; Ernst was then sent to a concentration camp. He survived and died in 1983."

eurovision,f4gz5n6,t3_dkhriu,1571586521.0,"In Canada, not so much. This year OMNI (the oh-so-famous European channel) *finally* aired Eurovision, after so many years! The reason why I watch Eurovision is because my mom grew up with it in Germany and so did I when we lived there. I also have a lot of European friends, so my friend group knows about Eurovision for that reason. Actually we held a watch party in May and even had a group chat to discuss leading up to the event, which was really nice considering no media attention was given to the event. But if I were to ask someone on the street,  ""Hey! Do you know what Eurovision is?"", they would probably give me a confused look."
