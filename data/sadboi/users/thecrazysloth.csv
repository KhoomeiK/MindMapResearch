My parents live in a country town in Western Australia. I'm in Vancouver. If I wanted to move back home, I'd need to somehow get a flight into the country, then sit through a 14 day quarantine, then another 14 day quarantine after getting into my state's capital, then I'd need special government permission to travel *within the state*, because regional areas all have movement restricted (my parents have not even been able to visit the city for a month). *That* is government restriction.   
When the virus hit, Australia's number of active cases was doubling every 2-3 days, peaking in late March with 300-500 new cases every day. In the last *30 days*, there have only been 12 new cases in my home state. Because transmission is now actually under control, restrictions are being carefully lifted and only 99 people have died in the whole country.   


Clamping down hard and fast worked for Australia and New Zealand. Meanwhile, Sweden, with essentially no restrictions, just recorded its highest monthly death toll since its 1993 influenza pandemic. Which is to say, more Swedes died this month than in any month since June 1993."

Not sure how much stock you can put in the report overall, though. Australia and the US both have the same score for ""political participation"", even though voting is mandatory in Australia.
