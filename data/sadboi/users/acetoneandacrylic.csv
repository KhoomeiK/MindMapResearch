all that said, lithium orotate is barely researched for anything because lithium carbonate is cheap and readily available and isn’t patented. and it’s not likely you would be at lithium levels that do anything on it at the doses you can legally sell as a supplement.

i don’t know what lithium would do for DID at all, it’s pretty much exclusively used to treat bipolar mania."

bpad (bipolar affective disorder) tends to have moods measured in weeks to months. when i’m depressed i guess i’m pretty much a typical sad bpd person, but when i’m manic bpd isn’t really an issue because i have manic psychoses that are way more pressing. last year i was stalked by an international canal of irish anarchists hell bent on sabotaging my life and destroying me and i went to great delusional lengths to stop them hs a psychotic break that almost cost me my life... except i wasn’t. and after months of that when i’d calmed down i looked back on it and thought what the fuck and had my meds adjusted.

you don’t want to be a father, that’s fine, and you don’t want custody rights or involvement, that’s fine too, but you aren’t talking about somehow trying to get out of child support which is the most fine thing in this situation.

I fully agree with the other poster here, being upfront was 100% the right thing to do and how he is responding to it is on him, not you."
