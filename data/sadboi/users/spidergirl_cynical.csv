But I finally found website called https://www.maccaron.in/en/ 
It claims to deliver authentic products from Korea and they have some stuff from COSRX i needed. it would be great if anyone reading this or anyone you know has had any experience with this website. Thank you in advance! :)"
introvert,fm8qdwa,t3_ftimvz,1585854072.0,"Going thru these comments and i cant decide if y'all are too smart,  stupid or just sad motherfuxkers. Either way, I'm one of you:)"
lonely,fm8omy5,t1_fm7ekkg,1585853172.0,"Thank you. Honestly its really great to hear the truth sometimes, that things getting better is not a miracle. It takes time, effort, resources and sometimes it takes forever. But you still have to push through. No other way really."
lonely,fm8obwc,t1_fm735ci,1585853013.0,"Definitely been there, done that. But i started to feel guilty, like i was holding the person back or something, so i did their job for them and separated myself lol. But seriosly don't do that. It's not healthy AT ALL."
lonely,fm8o056,t1_fm5otmn,1585852846.0,"Thank you my friend. I do give up easily and that's not some surface level bs, i gotta dig deep and work on that. And honestly i don't remember who told me to isolate myself but the fact that i trusted them(also the fact that i trust everyone except myself) annoys me to the core. Lot to work on haha."
confidence,fladpmp,t1_fl7k6pf,1584981830.0,"THIS. I've been trying to tell my brain that humor is subjective but all humor have one thing in common:fun. Not everyone might perceive it that way, and that's okay, but it is supposed to be funny for you,  somehow that's how it should be. Because my goal isn't exactly to perform for a crowd or anything, it's s to be more comfortable in my own skin, so without overthinking,  i should just do it. Thanks for this."
confidence,flad8pb,t1_fl79v0y,1584981565.0,"Yup, i dont wanna become a pushover type and then regret putting myself out there. Just gotta own up to who i am."

confidence,fkiamxl,t1_fkhjd0q,1584215530.0,"Oh wow,  I read this twice,  and it's kinda making sense now. Because if I go in with the intention of wanting to get better at being myself and becoming confident,  regardless of the output-failure or success, I come out  better and stronger than what I was before. I just really need to not overthink this so that mind is in for it a 100%. Thank you for that!"
confidence,fkia4vm,t1_fkhk996,1584215200.0,"I think I'll go check out the centre and decide if I could/shoud do it. I think my main concern is to not get demotivated to get better because I wasn't good enough or I couldn't be successful overnight. I might end up losing my confidence again. You're right about confidence coming from within, I'm over the fake it till you make for now. It is amazing what you've done, it gives me hope in some way. 

Agree about yoga as well, I've found that it's one of the best ways to work on myself from inside out but I just don't feel very enthusiastic about it so want to explore some other areas."

mentalillness,fkdnvw8,t1_fkcjh9i,1584086721.0,"Definitely. But for me its definitely easier said than done. Gotta change that., cuz i really want to. Thanks for replyingâœŒ"
mentalillness,fkdnlk0,t1_fkax8q8,1584086332.0,Definitely trying to be as responsible with my responses as you explained in the second part. Just seems weird to me that such a simple thing can start to feel so burdensome. But i get that people definitely understand better if you come from a genuine place. You just have to vulnerable and secure enough to let them know.
mentalillness,fkacgix,t1_fka2g0b,1584001582.0,Yo thank you so much for thatâœŒ

depression,fjc9x7s,t1_fjc7bvw,1583212753.0,"Wow that last part really got me-I've thought this way for so long, that somehow people are scared to find out they're not who they portray. I'm constantly trying to figure out how to go about everyday things while feeling this way, figuring out how i want to be like."
depression,fjbyvsu,t3_fcjuys,1583204492.0,"It's the exact other way round for me. I'm kinda out there about my illness and guess was?  It's not as comforting or amazing as i thought it would be.  People avoid me,  label me and think I'm weird.  So i guess if we do, we're weird,  and if we don't we're weird.  Either eay there's no winning with people."

depression,fjb0udw,t1_fjav8p9,1583184297.0,"Same. I keep making lists, plans after plans but the truth is that all that is just to distract myself from my commitment issues which is simply due to the fact that i truely have lost the passion for things. Simple as that."

mentalhealth,fj0lxcp,t1_fizt1oz,1582902951.0,The not being able to frame sentences part is effing true. I can't imagine being in one place and thinking in a continuous streak without having a brain fart. Lol. Hope we get better.
mentalhealth,fj0ljw4,t1_fizz2m8,1582902717.0,Thanks so much mate. Literally had no idea about such a thing.  Don't know for sure but I'll try to seek professional help.

depression,fii4paa,t3_f7tmzv,1582417330.0,"Hey guys!  I know many of you do no want to hear this because you're just exhausted and tired of hearing to the lies of what ""happiness"" is supposed to be like. But i just cant help say this(at least for my own selfish reasons)  thats it does get better. The feeling you have in your chest that convinces that happiness is so far away its not worth trying i just wanna say: its not the voice of reality but the depression thats stopping you. Dont cave into it.  Please try for one second to see the light, take one day at a time, breathe. Just one day.  One thing. Get out of bed and Brush your teeth. Next day comb your hair. Next day have a bath. Dont have to love yourself  to do all these, so conversely dont have to hate yourself so much as to not do them, if that makes sense.  I wish i had better words of encouragement but i did my ""one thing of the day"" and its not my best but it is something and it will be better one day. Because if not for this,  there's really nothing else."
confidence,fi82u5c,t3_f6v39x,1582232396.0,"Thought i wrote this myself and forgot somehow lol. Anywho, im in the same boat,  except i have depression and anxiety issues but hey we gotta start from something. And the number 1 thing on my mind rn is acceptance. Because no change comes fron being in denial about whats really real. Its just the way it is. Im ugly too and well i dont even know how to play video games lmao. It be like that sometimes. But not forever.  Hope you find what you want within yourself first before you go looking for it as you venture into the world. No need to be proud because now is the time to build the person that one day you can look at and say, yeah i became that and now i can say that im proud. Genuinely wishing you well. All the best mate!!!!"

depression,f5puqbn,t3_dop467,1572368192.0,"Personally, I'd say from what I've experienced by staying away from people for almost a year, you could say that isolation is like every other addiction. Once you get used to it, there's really no going back(not exactly, but kinda). And then when the high fades away you're stuck with the cycle of negative thoughts emotions, going back and forth between guilt and shame (again this is how it is for me). So yeah, it's awesome but what really matters is what you want in the long run I guess. You know, cause you gotta watch you're own back ALL THE DAMN TIME. Also if you wanna change you're lifestyle and involve yourself with people, that's tough but not impossible! Gday!
Staystrong!"

I'd say I've always been a creative person, but I don't know. Lately things have been weird. But I have the power to make them better. Really appreciate your reply. Thank you, hope you have a great day!"

But honestly if you want some advice, my therapist told me this one thing: have realistic expectations, and then you can go from up there to where you wanna be at. Don't think about time running out, there's plenty time left. I promise good things will come your way. You just have to believe that you deserve them, which you do. But for now, if you feel like you need hep don't be afraid to ask for it. 
Hope you have a great day!â™¥"
depression,f4xfsrm,t3_dlyghi,1571865161.0,"I suck at giving advice, but what I've realized is that the advice is really just being honest and considerate while giving your own opinion. So my honest opinion would be to get therapy. And what you could think is ""I have depression. It sucks. I suck. And I don't want to suck anymore. So I got to therapy. No, that doesn't make me a loser. It's actually fucking awesome."""

I love my parents too much to do something like that. Even though I haven't particularly felt any different, they say they've noticed some progress since I started taking my new antidepressants. So yay I guess! So you're right, I am just afraid to admit it out loud that I do feel  shit like this sometimes even though I have all the support and love. But knowing there's people out there who feel the same, it's somewhat consoling that I'm not some crazy person. 
Thanks again! I'm glad you got through it and found happiness:)"
