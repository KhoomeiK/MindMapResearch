At some point we have to stop waiting for the other person to apologize or say something even remotely nice. It probably isn’t going to happen or we wouldn’t be in the boat we are in.

lonely,f4k2082,t3_dksppg,1571632531.0,If you keep telling yourself that every day then eventually you will become convinced and become the very thing you fear. Only you can change that.
lonely,f4k1uea,t3_dksppg,1571632372.0,"There is someone for everyone. Everything you have messaged is full of doom and gloom and half of it you are convinced it won’t work before you even try. I did the same thing day in and day out. Ask yourself how has that worked out so far? I can’t instill willpower in you. You have to try because you want someone, you want a change. There will be failures but there will also be great successes. Remember Babe Ruth held the home run record for a very long time but he also held the strike out record as well. That never stopped him from swinging like he was going to hit his next home run."

lonely,f4k0bi7,t3_dksppg,1571630932.0,Girls can pick up on your desperation. When you honestly just let things happen they can tell and will feel they matter instead of just being a desperation attempt. I was as plain as they come dude with the social skills of a doorknob. It will happen

I was rejected a ton of times. You can’t let that stop you as she could be out there this very minute. If you give up she will never meet you and you will never meet her.
lonely,f4jzrxi,t3_dksppg,1571630435.0,I reached a point where it had bothered me so much for so long that I stopped trying and just let things happen. I still had bad days and nights etc. If I felt like asking a girl out I asked her. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t. As time passed I met a girl in college that helped me overcome my fear of intimacy. I got carried away though and tried to date as many girls as I could. It all settled down and I married the mother of two of my kids and it lasted 16 years. Wouldn’t give anything for that time.

Divorce_Men,f4bqk7j,t1_f4bqb2w,1571516845.0,Didn’t ask for your sorrow or anything else. Two completely separate marriages with different circumstances. Kind of hard to learn from one when it has nothing to do with the second.
Divorce_Men,f4bec23,t3_dk5214,1571511144.0,"Dude I am a 51m going through my second unwanted divorce. First marriage ended after 16 years and second one is coming to a halt after 9 years. The biggest mistake I made during my first separation and divorce was not treating it like I should have. You need to have an emotional you and a business you. The emotional you can still worry about her, try to reconcile or whatever. But the business side of you needs to take care of one thing, you!!!! This is no place for emotions or feelings to reside. Keep those on their prospective side. You will have a future past this...you have to keep that in mind. Even though this is my second I am still a freaking mess."
Christianity,f4b6i52,t3_dk5kfh,1571507563.0,It will happen my friend. I was twenty one before I ever truly dated. I went through several hit and misses and had even thought of suicide things were so bad one time. I finally let God have it and began focusing on who He wanted me to be. Now I have four kids from 15 to 26. I also have three wonderful grandkids. God brought me through one divorce and it was only by His Grace that I made it. I am also trusting Him now during a failed marriage for a second time. If I could give you or go back in time and give younger me some advice it would be as follows. Don’t settle for anything other than what He has planned for you. When you do meet someone hit your knees and pray like never before that your relationship be in His will.
Divorce,f4b5ovp,t1_f4asp66,1571507200.0,Unfortunately I suffer anxiety and depression prior to this ever happening. I lost a ton of weight last time and I have lost 33 lbs since the trouble began. I take my meds and sleep when I can and force myself to eat once a day. I have a wonderful support group of family and friends but not many live nearby. Last time I was working but this time I am on VA Disability. I am heartbroken that someone did this to you. I apologize on behalf of men everywhere. We aren’t all like that. Hope you are having a decent weekend.
Divorce,f49ffby,t3_djzag2,1571464439.0,I am so sorry you are going through this. My first marriage lasted 16 years and ended much the same way as you have described. My second marriage is apparently ending after nine years together. If you would have told me all of this years ago I would have laughed and stated that I would never have to go through such a thing twice! I wouldn’t wish this experience on my worst enemy. How someone can take that knowledge and intimacy and partnership and blow it to pieces mystified me daily. Feel free to message me if needed.
FriendsOver40,f487w3r,t3_djsxc1,1571433857.0,This will be my first Halloween alone in a very long time. Don’t know what I will do but I will plan something. I wanted to take a trip to the real Sleepy Hollow but it probably cost too much. They have a lot of events there.
Divorce,f3vtzml,t3_dife9f,1571184774.0,First marriage ended suddenly after 16 years and the separation and divorce about did me in. Now here I sit 5 weeks in to my second separation and divorce after ten years. I must be the dumbest 51m on the face of the planet. Every day is a fight to not pull the trigger. Down 30 lbs from not eating much and little to no sleep.
Divorce,f3vim4m,t3_dif3xw,1571176888.0,So sorry you are feeling sick. Hope both you and your daughter get to feeling better soon.
