Unfortunately there is no universal strategy guide for finding meaning in life - everyone is different. Try meditating over your feelings, and find what you value in your life. If the immediate response is 'nothing', then there is more soul searching to be done.

Part of the problem is that we try to seek out instant gratification. We think that avoiding doing wrong *once* or following good habits *a few times* will yield us results. Half the battle is just 'showing up'. There are days where you won't be able to 'show up' - whether it be due to lack of energy or willpower.

If we lay down our hands and tell ourselves that life will never be worthwhile anymore, we will create those very circumstances we wanted to avoid.

It's very true - life is in a constant flux of change, and the past is forever gone. But we hold the duty to ourselves to continue pushing forward despite the barriers and difficulties that lay before us. The only way to make tomorrow great is to truly believe it CAN and WILL be.

Regarded as America's greatest inventor, Thomas Edison said -   “I have not **failed**. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.”

You haven't failed. You are not a failure. You are simply incurring activities that have proven not to help you. What are your dreams? If you could do anything in the world, what would you do? If you take such permanent action, you will never be able to find what WILL work. The law of averages tells us that the more we fail, the closer we are to arriving at successful outcomes.

Please consider anything and everything you have not tried yet. I am sorry I cannot be more specific. I do not know your specific situation and do not want to insensitively suggest options that are monetarily impossible.

EDIT: Also - therapist are not 'one size fits all'. Sometimes it is worthwhile trying a few different therapists who deploy different approaches and methodologies (if trying different therapists is an option for you)."

Do not apologize. NEVER apologize for taking time to yourself to heal and cope.

It may sound vastly over-simplified - but just reach out to say hello. Start slow. Strong past connections will foster smooth re-connections. Those who truly value you will understand and respect your decision to share/not share your struggle. You cannot control rejection; no one can promise it won't happen. But having the strength to face the outcomes, no matter what they are, will bring you a great deal of personal growth.

Think of it like taking a cold shower - the longer you hesitate entering the shower, the more foreboding the outcome seems. Sometimes it helps to halt forethought and take blind action."

Meditation,eud7nw5,t3_cfwkjo,1563705994.0,"I'll start off by saying that this will be skewed by my viewpoint of drugs and alcohol -

&#x200B;

It truly comes down to which reality you choose. The temporality of your situation shouldn't skew your judgement. Remember - everything is temporary; LIFE is temporary. You fall down a slippery slope once you start justifying your actions by what is temporary and what is not.

Consider your 'base-line' existence to be your mind without any state-altering substances. THIS is the base-line reality. Any thing you supplement it (alcohol/drugs) is what should be brought into question as a matter of impermanence. Alcohol and drugs can be seen as undesirable because they steer our focus away from our base-line, 'unmodified' sense of life. Time you spend consuming drugs and alcohol - and the time you spend in the altered state as a result of their consumption, is time spent away from your baseline reality.

Subject to \[over\]use, you are not as well equipped to chase your goals with utmost aggression and dedication. And that is not to mention the possible problems of addiction/dependence.

My final observation - stop just for the sake of stopping. Observe how it affects your life. If you cannot stop using them, you may have another problem on your hands. Good luck."

My own take on it is that our minds are realizing the temporality of our existence. We need to come to terms with the fact that everything around us is in constant change. Lacking attachment allows us to be more fluid in our approach to life (whether it be material attachment, or interpersonal attachment)."
