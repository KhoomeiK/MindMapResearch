3 - Cities - One of their more funky songs that will show the direction which they would go in.
4 - Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On) - Really strong intro to Remain in Light, and has a lot of experimental sounds while also being catchy.
5 - Girlfriend Is Better - Captures the new style that the Talking Heads were experimenting with on Speaking In Tongues with the more synth-driven songs."
