relationship_advice,f2e8ux0,t3_dd5hkr,1570186877.0," Having severe depression does NOT mean you tell your partner you want to die every single day and make them feel like shit for even trying to express their own feelings. It‚Äôs abusive and you don‚Äôt deserve that. Life is short and you should spend as much time as you can trying to be happy, not around people who suck the life out of you. I‚Äôm a believer that people can change their actions, and she can choose whether or not she unloads all this on you every day. She‚Äôs choosing to bring you down with her. When my partner and I got together six years ago I acted very similar to her, I was very depressed and took it all out on him. I watched the life drain from him slowly and I didn‚Äôt even realize that I had the power to fucking stop - it felt like my darkness needed a partner to bring down along with it. I had someone in front of me who loved me and would be there for me when I needed them, but how can anyone be there for you when you just make them a miserable sad mess 24/7? I chose to admit obvious fault, seek help and change my ways for the sake of the relationship. Can she do that?"
