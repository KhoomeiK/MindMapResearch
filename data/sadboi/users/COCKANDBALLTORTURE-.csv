even if i managed to make friends with them my trust issues and my anxiety would keep telling me that they‚Äôre ‚Äúonly friends with you because they pity you, so dont put all your trust them because it‚Äôs not worth it‚Äù and because of it i start to drift away from them before i grind to a halt and both of us completely just stop talking"
