A general rule I like to follow with dating is to put the same amount of effort that the other party is putting in in. I mean for the first initial stages put in more effort to let them know you're interested and get something going, but at this stage where you've already slept together and she's viewing your posts, but just not answering you? Just put in the same amount of effort she's putting in and she's not putting in much effort, so don't put as much effort in either. If she starts putting in more effort then go ahead and match her effort. Don't put in more effort though in this case"

It is important to help people from getting super depressed and lose hope and if Starbucks can help with that, even a little, then I think it's important. I dont think starbucks should force everyone to work during this time, but if some coworkers want to work for extra money then id support them to do so. Especially a lot of employees just cant stay at home without getting even more depressed and anxious. Allowing them to go to work imo is benificial.

So talk to your health care professional about getting off meds and seeing if it is a good or bad idea"
TrueOffMyChest,fkh3eoi,t3_ficbuf,1584187052.0,I found that it's way easier to forgive others than it is for a lot of people to forgive themselves. When someone feels like they are cause of s bad situation it's hard to look at it and figure out how much your actions has actually hurt the other person or what the other person is thinking or how bad the actions really were. I'm glad your dad forgave youüòä not ever seeing you again is probably the extreme reaction that thankfully didn't happen. I'm really happy for you. Try learning to forgive yourself now

mentalhealth,fkh218z,t3_figpk9,1584185435.0,"I had to get out of my parents house. It was such a toxic place for me and it made me even more depressed. Idk if it's possible for you, but of the situation is really that bad, try reaching out to friends and maybe ask if you could stay there for the time being. Also maybe even talk to an University consoler. Perhaps if you explain that your home is a toxic place for you and will probably where you down. Is there any anywhere else to go?

I wish you the best"
mentalhealth,fkh1qg1,t3_fieabq,1584185056.0,"Changing my environment was one step that helped me so much with my mental health. I lived with my parents and I love them so much, but living with them is so toxic and has been a big reason as to why I was suffering so badly. Try to change your environment. It will help a lot. Maybe move out if you can. If you're in college and it's depressing you take a couple semesters off, If you don't like your job find a new one, try making new friends, etc. These a re the things I did (as well as take meds and staying away from drinking alcohol) and this has helped me so much"

AskMen,fjysv7y,t3_ffarkr,1583703865.0,"Girl here: once I went out with a guy. We both went to the same highschool and so I thought he knew one of my friends, a guy named Jon, and I thought he knew Jon was gay. Anyways I told my date that after our date I was going to go clubbing with Jon. For a a good couple of minutes until everything was cleared up he thought that I was going on a date with Jon until I mentioned that Jon and I were going with his bf Julio üòÇ what a misunderstanding, but if it wasn't cleared up I could see that potentially being the worst date for him. Especially if he thought I was leaving him to go on a date with another guy right after our date"

dating,fj27zfy,t3_faud71,1582936837.0,"For me when I get into this funk it help me to focus on myself and become a little more flirty.  Not over the top flirty, but just getting a settle little flirty vibe going on that get people to notice. 

See, when I do this I start getting flirty and then other people get flirty back to me and then things start to slowly escalate until there a spark starts with someone. This is how I get the chemistry going with people and that little spark of interest going. It helps to focus on my appearance, my hair, think about flirty things to say, and do. Put your own creativity into it and find how you best approach situations like."

unpopularopinion,fiqq7o3,t1_fiq2tg7,1582649660.0,"I totally get what you're saying. Me and my brother. Battle depression and anxiety. I try my best to be positive, find peace, get treatment, take care of my body and mental health, and I follow all of the doctors orders. I've been struggling for 5ish years and the treatment plan I'm following is finally working and I havent felt this happy since high school :,)
My brother has the opposite story. Hes completely given up. He won't accept his families support and yells at us and I'd say has become emotionally abusive towards us. I wish I could help him, but it's just not possible because he wont accept treatment anymore or at least try 

Point is to get better you cant give up"

selfimprovement,filehi5,t3_f8aa0a,1582499761.0,"My conclusion I came to was totally different than yours. I now live life how I want to live it (while still being healthy and doing what needs to be done), but if I loath anything that is taking away my happiness then i decided that I need to be happy right now and save that happiness

I ended up coming to the complete opposite conclusion than you came to.
How I came to this: At one point in my life I kept making myself do something that needed to be done even though I loathed it. I did this for four years and gritted my teeth in hope's that this would put me in a better place. The problem was that there were certain circumstances that kept me from making progress and I ended up failing this goal multiple times. I decided I'd have to go a different route and after that I had had enough and i was not going to force myself to do things that were super stressful to me unless I was seeing some progress going on. I mean, I definitely still keep my health in check and do the responsibilities that I need to do, but if there is something that would put me in a better place, but its taking a huge toll on my happiness, I might end up deciding to just not do that because I finally got my happiness back and  I cannot do things that will loose that again"
selfimprovement,filedu3,t3_f8aa0a,1582499697.0,"Questions for youuuu :)

So are you happier overall because of this? Or does doing this make every day more of a struggle for you (obviously you're making progress, but does doing this effect your happiness in a good or bad way overall?)"
socialjustice101,filbmpn,t3_f8cahl,1582497923.0,"I'm not too sure, but my first thought was that because you were a med student you're probably seeing more sick people overall than not sick poeple aaaaaand perhaps that is skewing you'r view on this subject? Perhaps not. But you're not going to be seeing a lot of the healthier poor people in that setting because they dont have the need to go there.

In any case though, it does make sense that poorer people would be struggling more than rich people because miney probably gives people more time.  Perhaps rich people just have more money and time to spend on their looks?  Maybe the poorer people just font put that energy into their looks but are overall happy and/ or healthy"

AskReddit,fil3rke,t3_f8fwr8,1582493019.0,"I asked a random guy out. We went out. I said let's head over to the bar. He said he was 16. I was 23 and I thought that the fact that I had mistaken his age was hilarious. I thought he thought it must be hilarious too so I started uncontrollably laughing and looking at him expecting him to laugh at this shared silly experience with me, but then I realized that he was just standing there looking super uncomfortable. Soooo I looked at him and said ""ok this is NOT a date anymore. This is just a hang out session. Since we are both here, do you want to just  get dinner with me...AS FRIENDS lol nothing more lol he agreed. Side note: I pride myself on not letting awkwardness get in the way of me enjoying my day or time and that tends to rub off on other people, so I think we had a lovely time at dinner. I told him not to pay for me, but he snuck away and paid for me anyway. So it was awkward and a little worrisome but it all ended well. We never really talked again but I think I appreciate my little awkward date story üòÇ lol

His name was Dan so me and my friends kind of joke about Dan the underage man lolol and what a gentle underage man he is for still paying for my dinner and all. 

I like this story, but also thinking back on it I'm really glad that this misunderstanding didnt go down an ugly road"
