changemyview,fpex8lw,t1_fpewrn8,1588556923.0,"yes, because it’s child support and if it’s going towards mommy and not the child, that’s wrong. mom should have her own job to at the very least cover her own expenses. if your child’s all set for the month take the extra money and do something good with it. use it as allowance, put it towards college or savings, hell even save it up as “emergency” money in case something comes up (accident, fire, whatever).

if social care workers can determine whether a kid is fit to live at their home i’m sure they could do a similar kind of check up if it really came down to that."

changemyview,fpetoer,t1_fpes3v3,1588554703.0,"well obviously it wouldnt be as simple as “you spent $40 at victorias secret i’m taking you to court”. a judge isnt gonna have anything to do with something so small. but again its an imaginary law, there would be something in place to help w/ that. but yes it would be useless for frivolous amounts. if you keep spending the money on yourself when it should be going to the child something should be done. it’s not spouse support after all. having record of where money was spent makes that 100x easier to check even if it’s got its flaws

idk if i had all the answers i might as well just go work for the governmant man lmao"
changemyview,fpeslwu,t1_fpes430,1588554056.0,"nah it doesnt have to be that deep though. the kid doesnt have to be in the worst conditions possible for it to still be used incorrectly. it’s child support and if the one receiving it is buying things for themself, then that’s incorrect because it has nothing to do with the child"

> define obviously needed 

bills/food/etc vs luxuries, we went over that"
changemyview,fpeqhub,t1_fpepa23,1588552784.0,"op’s original point was that some form of evidence, even if it’s not rock solid, could be helpful in deterring unnecessary spending *if needed.* not denying access to stores. 

you raise a good point on holidays/etc but i think it’d be fairly easy to tell whether it was for a holiday or not since you dont consistently spend large amounts at random places all the time. 

agreed on too many nuances regardless though. i’m not saying the law would be perfect just expanding on what was said."
changemyview,fpepcva,t1_fpeojkd,1588552095.0,"well one would assume youre not spending too much on necessities because they’re necessities. i’m talking about if someone were to use it on obviously unneeded things, someone else used spending $3k/mo or something stupid like that at walmart as an example of this.

also no i dont know how often child support exceeds the cost of the child lmao. but it obviously does happen"
CasualConversation,fpeosjq,t1_fpensnl,1588551755.0,"> a pod every 2/3 days

i used mine slightly more than that over a period of a few days (probably went through 2-3 pods), quit cold turkey because i couldnt get anymore + i wanted to stop anyways and i had to call out of work with nic withdrawal. which ended up getting me fired lol. but yea baby steps man unless you feel like dealing w that, it was like the flu but worse"
changemyview,fpenkyi,t1_fpeme5n,1588551023.0,"but if someone’s clearly spending more than what should be necessary there then there’s at least some record of it, that’s their point.

also since this is an imaginary law, you probably wouldnt be able to withdraw money (or, very much at a time) with it because that would defeat the purpose"
