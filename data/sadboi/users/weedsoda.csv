MDEnts,fqu29g0,t3_gkvahe,1589650623.0,I just moved to Gaithersburg and the deals are terrible and their customer service has been disappointing. I miss my old home  dispensary ReLeaf which had deals every day and amazing customer service.

Not saying snorting isn't addictive, but without the ritual I don't really crave it after I do it."
stimuluscheck,fq0rrmv,t3_gg6kcm,1589036755.0,Stupid question: I filed my taxes on March 20th. Mailed it in. Still no tax return or info on stimulus check. Just keep getting the message Payment Status Unavailable. If they haven't received my taxes yet... Should I go ahead and fill out the non-filers form? At least that asks for bank info. I'm getting desperate I guess.

MDEnts,fntifhb,t1_fnthwnj,1587242293.0,It‚Äôs cured pretty good imo. It won‚Äôt turn to powder in your grinder or have a damp uncured feel. It‚Äôs basically firm buds that you can squish a little. Slightly sticky. I‚Äôve gotten this strain maybe 5+ times and it always is great quality.
