I first was misdiagnosed as MDD and PTSD in 2016, and started on medication.  It took 4 years.  I was put on the right meds I think 6 months ago, and it was night and day I cannot emphasize enough the difference they have made.  However I am on a few different ones in conjunction. 

From the time I was diagnosed bipolar to the time I was on the right meds- it was 2 years.  This would have gone much faster had I not been stubborn and wanted to be off meds ASAP.  I was unmedicated for about a year in there before it hit a boiling point and I just knew I needed serious intervention.  

I recommend looking into DNA test kits that can cut out a lot of the guesswork.  There are kits that my moms psych has recommended that tell you which meds are most likely to help you. 

I‚Äôve never tried them bc i feel fine where I‚Äôm at but if you wanna cut out the guesswork, they‚Äôre good.

Bipolar disorder is complex and hard to treat.  Speak up, read a lot about the meds you‚Äôre on and get a basic understanding of neuroscience (like super basic) and it‚Äôll help a lot.  My path was unnecessarily long due to my own fuckery"

bipolar,f9qe8te,t3_e6ckh9,1575559693.0,"My grandma was bipolar and killed herself two weeks before my parents wedding.  I know how badly it messed up everyone around her and I found out how she died at way too young of an age, and since then I‚Äôve always been afraid of becoming like her. Being diagnosed bipolar was my worst fear come true, i used to have a very fatalistic view of the illness and what my future would be like with it, I just want to live to an old age like anyone else.  This illness terrifies me."

I did the same thing, I bombed my initial phone interview because I forgot it was scheduled for that day and drank weed hot chocolate before hand, but my boss chalked it up to nervousness and brought me in for a second round anyway.  Love when it works out lmao"

For people who are seasonally affected or work indoors- 75% of North America is vitamin d deficient so I think it‚Äôll help 


They actually work it‚Äôs amazing.  They bring about such a feeling of peace and happiness"
