Of the complexity and severity of the illness.  

Bring it up and discuss with your therapist if further treatment (IE psychiatric) might be worth looking into.  I can’t say one way or another what’s best for you, but I can say that bringing this up sooner rather than later is for the best. You sound pretty self aware.

I first was misdiagnosed as MDD and PTSD in 2016, and started on medication.  It took 4 years.  I was put on the right meds I think 6 months ago, and it was night and day I cannot emphasize enough the difference they have made.  However I am on a few different ones in conjunction. 

From the time I was diagnosed bipolar to the time I was on the right meds- it was 2 years.  This would have gone much faster had I not been stubborn and wanted to be off meds ASAP.  I was unmedicated for about a year in there before it hit a boiling point and I just knew I needed serious intervention.  

I recommend looking into DNA test kits that can cut out a lot of the guesswork.  There are kits that my moms psych has recommended that tell you which meds are most likely to help you. 

I’ve never tried them bc i feel fine where I’m at but if you wanna cut out the guesswork, they’re good.
