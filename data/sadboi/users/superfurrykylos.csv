The industry of today is very different from the industry thirty years ago. Journalists have to write significantly more articles, in significantly less time, for significantly less money.

They have quotas to fill so when are they supposed to find time to proof their work, especially considering that's not their job, it's the job of sub-editors?

Things aren't going to change unless people start being willing to pay for journalism again but I can't see that happening can you?

It's why after spending my teens and academic years working towards a career in journalism I made the jump to comms and PR after only a year.

I'm not defending it BTW, it sucks. Just explaining that it's more situational than anyone in particular's 'fault'."
