It will be all good seriously. Watch some really funny YouTube videos tbh. Do some painting, go for a walk, just get yourself moving, laughing, even crying. Just don't let the emotions stale out, because they then seep deeper and you may feel numb. Life's beautiful as is, and will always will be, come what may. Look at the sun, or at setting sun or the night sky shining and play your favourite rock songs and sing to em like no one's watching. Seriously, you're headed to better places.

You are not letting the universe do its work and are desperately holding on to things. Remember that if someone is your Soul Person, the universe will bring them back to you come what may. The age old quote "" Set them free, if they love you they'll come back and if they don't they were never yours""rings specially true in your case.

I really want you to let go of all of her thoughts, get rid of her number, any photos you have anything related to her and focus on yourself. Do things that you like daily, maybe even game , workout and build a solid foundation so that you may find someone who'll equally reciprocate to you, or give her the space to miss you and come back to you.

Kindly go in complete no contact with her and wait for her to contact you, and set a cap of 3 months, in which you'll be feverently working on yourself, and writing your ideal person's qualities on a piece of paper, everything that comes to your mind , and just letting it go after writing it by hiding it somewhere you rarely frequent.

 Going on No Contact is one of the healthiest strategies in any situation like this, and while you're at it, stop catching yourself in neediness mindset and think and believe that  you are enough and deserve all the love in the Universe.

After 3 months, I guarantee you, if you did everything I said in high vibration, you'll either be with her again or someone even better for you."

Next, write how that person would make you feel in a relationship and write it all in the present tense. Do this exercise only when you are in the most positive state of mind and feeling like a king/queen. Hide the paper somewhere you don't go much like your basement in your house or idk, then try to let go and forget about that paper and move on with your life.

Keep working in yourself and they will show up within 1-3 months.

In the mean time, try to avoid thinking that I'm single and forever alone , and I'm not worthy , may be its not just not for me. NO!

The dead giveaway would be if you are able to hear the affirmations not clearly but kind of, instead of a high pitched murmur in the background,in any part of the video.

That's why I like Hypnodaddy and Miss Synergy more than m sushibcu or say beauty krystallized.

Akuo will give you late but definitive results but m sushibcu you'll have a 50-50 chance of getting any results at all"
Subliminal,fp1r9k7,t3_gat6n1,1588245338.0,"Longer is better cos in shorter one's the affirmations are layered and sped up which may or may not be picked up by everyone's subconscious. 

Longer ones ensure complete understanding and absorption by the subconscious."
