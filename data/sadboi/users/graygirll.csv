BlackGirlDiaries,fqz4nx9,t1_fqynwy3,1589759847.0,"Following pages that praised dark skin on social media was a big step for me. I was never really teased or bullied for my skin like OP, but I never saw it presented positively, either. I also was left out when it came to romance all through highschool and college and honestly even now as an adult, and it stung. It can really hurt knowing that even guys that are your race or culture don't want anything to do with you. But you have to realize it's a reflection of them and their self hate, not your worth or value as a person.

Hobbies is a great way to develop yourself and learn more about yourself. There's input hobbies and output hobbies. Input hobbies are things you consume like shows, video games, or books for education. They can provide comfort and a sense of relaxation or joy. Output hobbies involve creating and making something, from art to writing to woodwork. You can derive a sense of accomplishment from these and have an end product to look forward to. It's nice to have a healthy mix of both. 

Aside from that,there's other self care things that can boost your  mood and esteem like exercise, daily affirmations, gratitude journals, and surrounding yourself socially with loving, supportive, affirming people. Also watch how you treat and present yourself. When I had lower self esteem, I never dressed up. I hated it. I felt like I was calling attention to myself by ""trying"" to look good and that everyone would see through me. 

But eventually I realized that I was worth looking good for and making myself feel confident in my appearance, so I started dressing better. It's important to allow yourself to take up space in the world and own your quirks, flaws and differences. You felt insecure about your skin before, now being and loving dark skin is ""trendy"". For me the same thing happened with my ""nerdy"" hobbies. Basically, it doesn't matter what's in or out because it always changes. You might as well love and own your differences because you determine how you feel about yourself."
AsianParentStories,fqyqatu,t1_fqyoxsj,1589752782.0,"What?! She seriously made you take out a loan to pay back HER loans...that's ridiculously selfish and so financially unwise. Are you the oldest? It really sucks you didn't have anyone to advise you against that. Graduating or going through college with as little debt as possible is the ideal. I can't believe she found a way to make you I debt and then tried to justify it with ""well I pushed you out my vagina and didn't let you die"" type crap. Like that's called being a parent...guilt tripping your kid for their existence is truly low.

Don't worry, you're not a bad kid or a bad person. If your parents are loving and caring and supportive, they wouldn't even have to ask for your support monetarily or otherwise--that's the natural way it  goes. But when they gaslight and emotionally abuse you, as they get older they realize they have to find a way to keep you close to care for them so they start demanding you pay up, because they know the way they treated you growing up didn't warrant it. Definitely make sure you have your own bank account and money she can't access and don't give or borrow her anymore! And if you chose to, make sure its an amount you're okay with parting with forever."

Meanwhile, my sister who's drowning in debt, because she didn't give them hundreds of dollars as a ""thank you"" for basically raising her or helping her through school, is ""selfish and ungrateful."" They do the same crap with me, even to the point where if I buy something for the house or pay for something as a favor and ask them to pay me back, they act like I'm being entitled or selfish. To ask back my own money. They're both working well paying, full time jobs btw. So its not like they're poor. 

Ignore her, save your money, and get yourself physically and financially free. Tell her you want to save to be able to support yourself in future unless she wants her grandkids to starve, or whatever. Any money after you leave is from the goodness of your heart and as a gift, not obligatory. We shouldnt owe them money for doing their job and raising us, they chose to have kids."

If you can't be caring towards someone without feeling like you have to drop everything else in your life, then maybe it's not the right time for you to be dating and you need to learn balance.

But when I finished college I felt like OP--unwanted, bad luck with romance, like nothing was ever going to right. Friends were starting to get into more serious relationships, my parent were making comments, I felt so much pressure so I just found someone and dated them for a while. Just to feel wanted and validated, though I didn't want to be with them. When that wore off and I tried to look for something again, I just had it thrown in my face over and over that guys ""at this age"" just wanna fuck and that's it. So I forced myself to do something I didnt want to do because that's what I'm ""supposed"" to do in my twneties.

Op, you're not alone. Fuck the time line and the pressure and societal expectations. Don't do anything or settle for anything you don't want. And don't lower your standards for anyone.

FemaleDatingStrategy,fqu8izx,t1_fqu3xjv,1589654090.0,"Yup, this is me. Growing up I was mostly the opposite way--I would catch feelings, tell them, be rejected and avoided and the friendship would end. Then when I got older, it flipped: they'd tell me they liked me, I'd tell them I didn't feel the same but still wanted their friendship, and they were like nope!! And the friendship would still end. Once I made the mistake of giving a chance to a male friend who confessed to me after we were close friends for 3 years. I even met his family, who were all really sweet, and they apparently knew how he felt and were rooting for us. Two weeks after our date he got back together with his ex and ghosted me. Some friend.

I used to internalize all of these interactions and think that there was something wrong with me, and even had a LVM directly ask me that when I told him guy friends don't stick around. But eventually I realized that the close friends I have in life were more than good enough, regardless of gender, and I didn't need anyone around who was going to be a drain or who couldn't handle rejection or respect my boundaries."

In hs and even in college when people were getting their toes wet with dating, I was rejected by anybody I had feelings for and eventually just stopped trying, would hold myself back from getting attached. Felt like a lost cause. 

Even when I started dressing better, came out of my shell, wore makeup etc it didn't make much of a difference. I'd still never get approached irl, and anytime I go out with friends, I stand awkwardly on the sidelines while they get hit on...be it at the club, bar, grocery store or gym. Ive never really figured it out, since I know I'm not ugly, and I think I'm pretty friendly and approachable. For example, a friend of mine, who's constantly lavished with male attention, asked **me** recently how to be more sociable and how I talk to people so easily...because she's shy. Meanwhile, guys don't give me the time of day whether when I was more shy or outgoing.

 I'm not a fan of meeting people on apps, I feel like it lends to shittier behavior. I guess I don't really have advice, just relating to that feeling of general shock about getting matches,but it never translating over to rl."

Parents like ours hold their kids to this impossible standard so that you always feel like the goal post is moving, and you'll never be done chasing it and trying to earn their impossible approval. It's a damaging way to raise and control a human, and plays into that feeling that you constantly have to be going going going, no time to breathe. 

My rents excuse is that ""im young"" so taking any time off for a split second, regardless of what I'm doing (working, traveling, etc) is wasting my youth when I should be stressing about something.

dating_advice,fpog8b1,t3_gec76v,1588783970.0,"I feel this way all the time. I'd say first of all, quit comparing yourself to others and their relationships and speed. If it's easy for them to hop from person to person, they might not be looking for the ""clicking"" or spark that you are. They could just be settling for whoever available because they don't want to be single. Some people are serial daters and it's okay if that's not you and you want to hold out for something emotionally deeper. I think that's more normal, in fact.

Self awareness and reflection is important. For the few people you did click with, what made them similar? What made them different? What are some qualities you want in a partner that you think would help you click with them? Society tells us it's random or chance, but the more you think about it and can identify those factors, the easier they are to control and look for. It works the same way for red flags, when you're aware of them, you can spot and avoid them earlier. 

Because you're aware of this about yourself, you should maybe recognize it'll take you longer to find a partner that you feel right with, but it'll be more worth it in the end. Hang in there! :)"

And like the above poster said, more serious topics like previous relationships will come up naturally as needed. You don't have to air out all your dirty laundry of the past, just keep it in the context of what the two of you are looking for going forward. 

Also, don't cave into that weird pressure we sometimes feel when we like someone to talk 24/7, I feel like that's where the ""what do you talk about?!"" Panic starts. Conversations have ebb and flow, they're not mean to be 24/7. 

As far as guys being straightforward, it depends on the topic. If it's something really basic, they might be indifferent or not care.

dating_advice,fpo9k3d,t1_fpo8hm6,1588780728.0,"My first sentence was ""not all"" and that that's literally my experience. I don't know how you can say that my personal experience is ""negative attraction"" or garbage, because it's not in your or my control, it's just what happens. No, sex isn't that hard to get, but read through this sub or any other OLD related one and theres tons of stories of guys getting distant and cold after having sex with someone, or suddenly shifting to this whole ""I don't know if I want a relationship right now"" speak because they got what they wanted. After several dates, after being romantic and expressing otherwise initially. 

Being *positive* and giving guys the benefit of the doubt is what landed me in those kinds of situations. I've had guys tell me to my face that they lie to women about wanting a relationship so they can sleep with them. And I've had it happen. It's reality. I don't think I'm negative minded or immature for not preferring platforms where the majority of people I interact with treat people like that without a second thought. 

Its great that you've met good guys from apps, or that your friends have. That's wonderful for them!

It's a different kind of hurt when someone you like constantly acts like you're less than what they want in every possible way, and then acts like you're overreacting by pointing it out. Ive grown over the last few years to love myself more and be proud of my quirks so to speak, but it definitely knocked me back quite a lot and I feel like I'm at square one again.

What incentive would he have to treat you better if you keep chasing him/sleeping with him when he doesn't try? It sounds like you're caught up on how he used to behave, which, to be frank, was clearly just an act to get to sleep with you or get you interested. Don't fall in love with the person he pretended to be before. Look at him showing his true colors now.

But in my experience, it's just a matter of them wanting to keep you on that hook/in limbo so they can gain something (attention, free therapy, etc) without having to give any kind of commitment. And when I demand to know their intentions, I get waffling and sweeping generalization and avoidance and beating around the bush. At this point, anything that isn't a direct yes is a no, and I'm not waiting around to sus it out beyond that. I don't want to be with someone who's unsure about me.

KDRAMA,fowuumm,t3_g7gx4m,1588127639.0,"A friend of mine from college had been feeling for me for years, unbeknowst to me. When I graduated, he wrote me a long letter about how he'd been in love with me for a long time, but never had the courage to tell me, etc. I turned him down at first because of distance, but a year later, we start talking again and I find out hes moved back close by for school. He asks me on a date, and visits me by train. 

The date was fun and cute and perfect (we got food and played arcade games.) He doesn't try anything romantic, though. When it's time for him to leave, I walk him to the train and he gives me a long hug. He goes to board the train and I walk away, as it starts raining. A few minutes later, the train pulls away and I hear him calling my name. He runs up behind me and Im confusedly asking what happened, and why he didn't get on, and he just grabs my hand, spins me around, DOES THE SLIGHT DIP and kisses me right on the mouth."
dating_advice,fowsexu,t1_fovvcau,1588126145.0,"Agreed, and moving to snap has never done anything good for me even when it's not that worst case scenario.

I generally stick to my rule of staying in-app until meet up, and depending on how that goes, we can exchange numbers or whatever. And if it goes left, it's as easy as unmatching. 

A friend of mine, not through OLD but I think some stranger who hit on her, gave up her snap. He sent her a dick pic, in the middle of the day, unprompted, while she was with her male friends. She sent back a picture with them and never heard from him again."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fojlhzr,t1_fojjzgo,1587823969.0,"It's *akata. Some Americans take it offensively, because they hear that the word means ""wild animal"". But an alternate translation would be (this is loose sorry) ""a stray that has lost its home"" (as in, Americans here are disconnected from native culture). And theres a word every type of people because, you know, different language. Not necessarily a bad thing.

And thank you for pointing out that bit about the media--a cousin of mine told me that all they know about black Americans is what they get on the TV there which  is this ""ghetto, hood, Ratchet"" stereotype. When they get here, that's the idea they have in mind and it can be hard for some of them to shift their perception.

BlackPeopleTwitter,foiu4ic,t1_foimb2u,1587797077.0,"Thought there's similarities between native African and black American culture, there's many differences too. Native African families (speaking generally) tend to be more like the ""Asian"" family stereotypes here in the U.S.: very strict, focus on education and career. Etc. They want their kids to grow up to be respectable and successful. Not saying that black Americans don't, but native Africans will often encourage their kids to engage in hobbies/behaviors and behave in a way that black Americans deem as ""for white kids"" like reading, being studious, being more introverted, speaking ""properly"" etc. (also, African American vernacular English obviously wouldn't be something you speak if you come from another country, so your kids wouldn't speak it either. I had to learn it because I got tired of being told I speak ""white"".) 

Also I've noticed here that your blackness is often measures against tangible things like the music you listen to, the way you speak, dress, hobbies etc: while in the culture I grew up in, you're simply black because of the color of your skin, face value--there's not that much more to it. Here those tangible things hold a lot more weight to the point that if you don't engage in them, your ""blackness"" is something that can be taken away."

dating_advice,fogmbah,t3_g76i3q,1587754406.0,"For me it was more like a couple months later. I used both Tinder and OKC when I first started OLD, more of the latter though. Went on lots of first dates, some fun, some weird, and when there was enough interest for me to want a second one, Id get ghosted. Got busy with school for a while, when things slowed down, I'd download again. It's a weird cycle, but the results never really changed. 

I don't know where the magic idea comes from that women are being blasted with matches, or maybe I'm just ugly, but Tinder always fared worse for me with the empty bios, dead message threads, and the ""add me on snapchat"" followed by a haunting, etc. I also tried bumble and it was similar to OKC, but slower, maybe it's not popular where I live. My inbox was full of messages I'd sent asking questions or making a funny comment about a picture or the person's bio....I got crickets. I'm taking a break from dating atm but I'm sure I'll have to jump into the wonderful world of OLD again eventually--the ways that people my age meet irl are not really things that I'm into."
dating_advice,fogj59i,t1_fodru8x,1587753237.0,"Yeah, I'm kind of in that process now of questioning myself and thinking of all the things wrong with me, why it always ends this way etc. What makes it even more frustrating is that when I try to ask people, not just friends but even possible romantic partners I pretty much get that I'm ""too good"" of a person or a potential partner, that they think they're gonna mess it up or want more time to fool around with strangers before they ""settle down"" with someone like me. It's frustrating cuz it doesn't give me anything to fix about myself and it's like I'm just waiting for guys about my age to be done ""playing"" and then remember me later, like a toy they can put down and pick up when they feel like. It's a shit feeling. 

I was supposed to be ""taking a break"" from last year, I deleted apps but got involved with people irl and got more hurt that way. But after what happened most recently I really am taking a true break this time and focusing on myself and my goals. Maybe by the time I'm closer to where I need to be someone will come along."
dating_advice,fogfng1,t1_foer37l,1587751971.0,"Yes, that exactly! I have anxiety and I'm quite the overthinker too, just in general. Today's weird hookup/dating culture where no one ever wants to be upfront about what they want and it's some stupid competition of who can care less/hurt the other person more...it doesn't help, not at all, and I'm not cut out for it. I guess we're just the ""old fashioned"" types, though I don't think wanting commitment or happiness with someone should be considered as such. It's true that it's not healthy to get attached too quick, but I also don't wanna shame myself so having so much love to give, you know? It's finding the balance. 

Sometimes I just have to remind myself that the right person will be as excited about me as I am about them and neither of us will have to hold back with how we feel. Hopefully we'll both find that person someday soon. :)"

It can be really emotionally exhausting, which is why I'm not dating right now, but I don't know how to fix this.

Not saying that theres not other subs, but I don't think you should be shamed for posting in this one because you can relate and so can others, and you feel like this is somewhere you can get support.

Its hard to really give any advice without knowing you age or where you're at in life. Are you about to leave for college to start this path to medical school? Are you already in university and living at home? And do you know what you want to do that's not medicine that you can ge a good career with? If so, and you can prove that you'll be okay and able to provide for yourself, I say maybeee talk to your parents about it. 

But honestly, mine were very stubborn and forceful about being a doctor. I wasn't able to explore other fields until I left for university. So you might also want to do that--leave for university somewhere far, tell them after you get there what you're majoring in, and throw yourself into that and work hard so that you don't have to move back home after graduation. When they see you getting internships and work and actually succeeding in your field, they may soften up to it. Unless it's a creative field, then you're probably screwed."

I'd listen to him rant, I'd drop what I was doing and help etc.  But when I was down or upset, he didn't seem to care.

Luckily, I already have friends in my life who care about me and love me, and I realized he wasn't one of them. So I simply texted him and told him I was done with things. (Note: this was maybe my 3rd time trying to end things, I'd tried in person, over the phone, and even a letter.) The hard part wasn't cutting him off though, it was stopping myself from getting sucked back in. All the I miss yous and I wanna be with yous are pointless when they don't commit to it.

Your guy might not be the same, but just because  a relationship didnt work out doesn't mean you should force a friendship. You *want* a relationship. He doesn't, and he's said it a million ways : he's not ready, he feels pressured, etc. There's your answer. No need to try to force yourself to be friends with someone when you didn't get more.

AskReddit,fo1tsx2,t3_g4uku1,1587441356.0,"The only C on my college transcript is from my first dual credit class (a community college class that can be taken in highschool). I took it in the summer and had a crazy family situation at the time and just couldn't keep up the work. The day the book report was due, I asked the professor if I could ""print it"" in the empty office down the hall and he said sure. I went in there and wrote the whole thing in less than an hour. I printed it, and came to find that class had ended early, which never happens. So I slid it under the door and sent him an email.

The next day, he told me he saw my email but he doesn't accept late work under any conditions. I failed the assignment and made a C in the class despite good grades on everything else, including the exams. 

Later on, I ran into a classmate who had that professor at a different time slot. I lamented to her about my poor grade, and she made a confused face. ""Professor didn't let you turn it in late?

It's not always those exact words,  but it's usually something along those lines. It was a close male friend who said that quote, but I feel like I've been hearing versions of it time and time again, hence the ""you're the kind of girl I'd marry."" Also that I'm chill, ""low-maintanence,"" a ""good girl"", etc. Its all very vague and it doesn't necessarily sound bad, but when you get turned down as much as I have and that's the reason it boils down to, it can be confusing. It can also make you feel like you're not good enough for the ""right now."" 

I do consider myself to be pretty mature, but I also like anime and cartoons, so its not like I'm super uptight (at least I don't think so.) I get told I'm funny a lot, actually I think it's the most common descriptor I hear. I also don't think I've got it super together, most of my dating was in college when I didn't know what my future would be, and after that I went back to living with my parents which isn't ideal. But maybe I give off the vibe that I have it together?? Even so, and even if I did, I don't know why that would be a bad thing to scare potential partners away. I'm also nowhere close to being ready to get married or have kids, and I don't know how someone can phase that out on just one or two dates. I'd just like a regular, monogamous relationship that's not an ambiguous, we're kind of together but not type crap. I didn't think it'd be so hard to find. But thanks for the well wishes!!"

And lo and behold, I hated it. I hated having to hold back feelings and having to rethink a million times when I wanted to be affectionate or caring because that would be ""too relationship-ey."" I hated the ambiguity and the weird in between. So, it's back to the drawing board. 

Unfortunately the rest of the internet isn't like reddit, and saying that you want a genuine connection somewhere like Tinder seems naive to say the least...but best of luck to the both of us, fellow marraige material!"
