Now I understand with a kid there’s gonna be lots of problems like sick days but for her you can smell the bull crap, she would constantly call in claiming her kid got injured or sick all the time, she would constantly come in to work more than 30 minutes late, Starbucks drink in hand and complain how hard her life is, but it was obvious she was fishing for attention and making crap up, even complain about money problems when all she has to do is not be lazy.

Now the worst part is she has told one of the managers in a conversation that she was livid with her dog almost drowning in her grandparents pool for the second time, and said she’d beaten the dog out of anger.

Also pardon my language.

I work at an animal care center so we have daycare, grooming, hospital and pet lodge.

I work in pet lodge and we’re the ones who do most of the laundry, well we only have 2 washers and 2 dryers. They break down all the time so since we go through so many towels and blankets in a day, having one machine down will slow us down immensely.

Hospital is always coming down to steal our fucking towels no matter how much we have, so we’ll always hide it from them. Because hospital and pet lodge are the departments that need them the most.

We ended up throwing away 70% of the laundry we own cause we wouldn’t be able to clean them for months and the ammonia was getting stronger.

This has been the biggest issue of the place but the managers will only listen to the doctors, the doctors will have the stupidest shit to complain about like- “I can’t figure out if this dog is actually named Cupcake” even though every single dog comes with a piece of paper with all their info on their cage, they just don’t want to read and the managers end up spending a lot of money on name tags just because every one here is super fucking lazy."
