gamingsuggestions,fr2cng8,t3_gm42gu,1589834997.0,Shiiiit whatâ€™s that game where you control a bunch of minions and you go around doing bad stuff? Overlord!
gamingsuggestions,fr2cask,t1_fr1r0wv,1589834830.0,Is it? I actually loved evolve but thought Predator seemed kinda generic so didnâ€™t bite on it yet. I liked all the abilities and stuff the hunters had in Evolve. Actually I didnâ€™t really like being the monster.

gamingnews,fqri070,t1_fqrfvcp,1589584743.0,I know what youâ€™re saying. I just thought it was cool with the wind and the bird and fox showing you the way. I get lost in open world games and put them down. I feel like this will help some.

BetterEveryLoop,fp0mz8g,t1_fp0kj37,1588212550.0,Really itâ€™s reaction time which should be the measure no? 90 mph baseball comes much quicker than a 60 mph softball shorter distance or not.

dragonballfighterz,fll8310,t1_fll557o,1585255355.0,Itâ€™s been a weird ramp up. Went from super dashing cuz nobody blocked. To not super dashing because I get punished to now super dashing knowing theyâ€™ll block but using assist to make the actual hit. Iâ€™m not ranked up enough to see how thatâ€™s countered.
Doom,fll5a7g,t3_fomh9m,1585253882.0,Iâ€™m the same. I grew up on consoles and have a hard time like going up stairs or changing direction quickly like 180s.
