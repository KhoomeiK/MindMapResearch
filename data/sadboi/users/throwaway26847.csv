BPD,f3cqlkd,t3_dgh8jr,1570827081.0,"Reading some of the comments it does strike me that people confuse validating someone's feelings with agreeing with them. The OP clearly has been through an awful experience. My friend has BPD and I feel for her so much when she goes through these things. The feelings are real and I've never doubted how badly they affect her. Nor do I doubt how distressing this was for the OP. 

But look, someone cheated on a test, you reported them, nothing happened, so you stabbed yourself with a pencil. It was an overreaction. The logical part of you knows that. But you did it anyway, because unfortunately that's what this condition does. That's how it is."
BPD,f3cn82k,t3_dgf7k7,1570825980.0,You haven't told us why she can't see you for a month. Did she really just say 'I can't see you for a month' without any explanation. And did you not ask why?
BPD,f2kv5vf,t3_ddoi9p,1570289549.0,"Tell the truth. My friend has BPD, she often cancels things because of how she is feeling. I don't mind at all. The more she tells me about how her condition affects her the easier it is for me to deal with."
BPD,f22mrx4,t3_dbl23u,1569892161.0,"You are not a piece of shit. You don't need to hate yourself because you had sex. You haven't hurt anybody, it's not a *bad* thing to do. It might have been risky and it might not be what you wish you had done, but that just means it's a mistake. Don't beat yourself up too much about making one of those.

And of course if you were sexually assaulted you can't even call it a mistake. I wasn't there so I don't know what happened, and you can't recall. The fact you were so drunk you can't remember what happened might even suggest you were so drunk you couldn't have chosen to have sex (though that's something of a contentious point which often arises when these cases come before courts)."
BPD,f1xx0lp,t1_f1xtavh,1569805307.0,I think it's quite possible that this music thing happens more often to those with BPD and causes greater distress than it does to others. But it definitely is a thing a lot of people experience. It's really annoying actually because it can ruin some of your favourite songs!
BPD,f1xebo1,t3_daxmpc,1569797203.0,"Can confirm this is something that affects those of us without BPD too. Maybe not as strongly, but there are some songs i would just turn off because they make me miserable. Usually because they are strongly associated in my mind with someone i don't see any more."
BPD,f0xasjy,t3_d716b2,1569026893.0,"At the risk of giving unsolicited advice myself, have you told your friends about this?"
BPD,f0uvows,t3_d6p3xz,1568952366.0,I think you need to find out why he doesn't believe you have this condition. What does he say about the fact a qualified expert has diagnosed you with it?
BPD,f0uus94,t3_d6lsak,1568951466.0,"All I can say to you is that my friend has BPD and I'm not the slightest bit interested what other people think of her or the merits of my friendship with her. I can look after myself and I decide for myself whether she is worth being friends with, nobody knows me or her well enough to make that decision for me. You should trust your fiance feels the same way about your relationship. There's no other way to live I'm afraid. 

And also remember, the reality is we all want to protect out friends from what we perceive to be a damaging relationship. You would do it too. Sure, you're informed about BPD but there will be things you are ignorant of and you'd probably warn your friends off certain people too in situations where really you don't know the full facts. Nobody goes through life without making ignorant snap judgment about others, particularly when we're trying to protect people we care about. It's natural: you shouldn't approve of it but there's no point getting angry about it either. 

The best course of action may just be to tell your fiance that you don't want to hear about what others think of you. To be honest I'm not sure I would want to hear about what people say about me, and I'm supposedly 'neurotypical'!"
BPD,f0us7lk,t1_f0k4h1u,1568949186.0,"Now I think you know that I did not say that everyone with BPD is a monster with dark secrets. Don't be disingenuous: it's beneath you.

You're perfectly entitled to your views about sexual morality and you are perfectly entitled to avoid having sex with any 16 year olds because you think it is wrong to do so. For what it's worth I agree with you that 20 year olds should not be having sexual relationships with 16 year olds. And for that reason I would't have such a relationship.

However I don't get to decide how other people live their lives. The law decides that. I don't know if the law has been broken in this case. If you suspect someone is breaking the law then the fair and proper thing to do is report it to the authorities. Spreading gossip online won't protect any victims and it doesn't give the suspect a fair hearing either."
BPD,f0jx3kx,t1_f0jssyk,1568665071.0,"A remarkable conclusion to reach based on one post on Reddit. You seem to be more interested in 'ruining' someone and taking joy in the suffering of someone you consider to be a ""bad person' than you are about protecting people from harm.

I dare say many people with BPD could be 'ruined' if their friends spread gossip about them. You might want to consider how it would feel if you were on the receiving end of this sort of public monstering.

If the OP is seriously concerned about the welfare of this 16 year old then the proper approach would be to speak to her friend, consider speaking to parents or others with a *legitimate interest* in the matter, and if things really warrant it the authorities could be contacted. But that should not be done lightly - it should be done for the right reasons, in light of a sober and calm assessment of the facts.

It should also be remembered we have no evidence of any law breaking and I would also remind you that laws and norms vary by country to country. The OP has not told us what 'dating' entails in the context of this relationship.

Spreading gossip and hate serves no useful purpose whatsoever and it will not make your life any better."
BPD,f0g7n2e,t3_d4t0vc,1568594951.0,"I don't have bpd but my friend does. I probably do at times have a tendency to see her only through the lens of her BPD. It's a huge part of her life afterall. But most of the time I don't do that and I remember there's a lot more to her than her condition.

Most people who take an interest in you will, like me, be genuinely trying their very best. But sometimes, especially if we are having our own stresses and difficulties in life, we might just dismiss whatever you're thinking or saying as merely a manifestation of your BPD. Even when it's not, and even though we're wrong to do that."
BPD,ezrxvvm,t1_ezrvwck,1568080280.0,"A person who never has any time to listen to your problems is obviously not someone you should be friends with. You are of course correct that you shouldn't be friends with people who are not right for you. 

The OP, however, is describing a person who *on one occasion* has said that they just need a night off and will message them tomorrow. That is entirely *reasonable* behaviour. The idea that the OP should ditch someone as a friend for that reason is absurd.

The OP needs help and support to understand and accept that their friend's behaviour is normal and nothing to worry about it. Reinforcing the OP's worst fears is unhelpful."
BPD,ezrw3h1,t3_d2034b,1568079593.0,Great progress. And don't be afraid if you relapse. Progress isn't always linear and steps backwards are sometimes inevitable. But you're always learning and that is key
BPD,ezrvfud,t1_ezrtwg3,1568079330.0,It is unrealistic to expect that a friend will never upset you. It's inevitable. The OP needs help to deal with that hard reality.
BPD,ezrv475,t1_ezruco0,1568079204.0,I don't think you have understood what I said. Nobody is calling anyone worthless.
BPD,ezrthhl,t1_ezrfgq9,1568078572.0,Very unhelpful comment. Try not to engage in 'worthless certainty'. You know almost nothing about this man or the friendship in question. You have reached a definitive conclusion about this man's entire character based on one Reddit post by a plainly upset poster who is going through a hard time.
BPD,ezhdbem,t3_d14b3h,1567908843.0,"As long as your psych is in full knowledge of all the facts, i.e you haven't held any information back from them, you would be better trusting their judgment than the guesswork of anyone on this sub. If there is information they are not aware of then you need to ensure they become aware of it so they can give you the correct advice.

Experts can of course be wrong but they are wrong less often than the rest of us. 

*If you feel genuinely suicidal you must contact the emergency services*. You wouldn't go to a friend or a loved one if you were about to die from some physical injury or illness. You would get medical help. This is no different. 

As for your FP, she has done the most selfless thing anyone can do. Sometimes if you care about someone you have to let them go for their own good. You may not appreciate that now but you seem intelligent and insightful enough to recognise that one day you may see it that way too."
BPD,ezcfdsk,t1_ez8nsl8,1567834266.0,This all seems very plausible and I'm persuaded that my initial approach was probably mistaken. I say 'probably' because I am not prone to the levels of remarkable certainty everyone else here seems to be :)
BPD,ez86wmf,t3_d081ex,1567735648.0,"My close friend has BPD. I don't think she is likely to develop any romantic feelings for me but I have sometimes thought 'what if she does?'.

It wouldn't change anything from my point of view - I'd still love her as a friend and it wouldn't make me uncomfortable at all. But how she would react to being rejected is something I don't like to think about."
BPD,ez5icrx,t1_ez2w23w,1567699850.0,"I'm strangely unmoved by the things she says. It upsets some people but it just doesn't seem to affect me. If she starts to say things that upset me I'll have to deal with that when it comes.

Her painting the situation in a much worse light is what has happened here, but the advice other people on this thread have given me is that I should just leave her be and she can talk to me again if and when she wants to. 

I'd be pretty devastated if she chose not to speak to me again, but I have no desire to harass her and I certainly don't want to do anything that will make her condition worse. So I think that's what I'm going to do. I will be there for her consistently, but only if she wants."
BPD,ez4qggm,t1_ez3i21g,1567690666.0,"This has certainly given me something to think about, particularly the bit about my approach inviting her to do it again which I obviously want to avoid.


I'm not entirely convinced that in the real world we don't take care about how we say things, but I think I take the point ;)"
