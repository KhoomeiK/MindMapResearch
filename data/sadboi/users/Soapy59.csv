Yeah, mania is fucking insane, if you were tired, you aren't anymore, it gets absolutely vaporized, to me, very comparable to taking like 50-70mg of amph sulph, GOOD amphetamine. Problem is, I tend to detach a lot, and so it feels like I'm merely observing the words I type on the screen rather than them being part of me, they are still my words, of course, they are just detached, while I'm feeling like god himself. It's pretty cool. Not really a  common experience since it always tends to wanna start when I'm alone and at night, but that's when I tend to wanna go sleep, so I typically spend time grounding myself and just going to bed instead, haha. I understand what you're saying though, I truly do.

&#x200B;

Yeah, so thing about schizophrenia is, most people have fairly normal lives before they get pushed into it, it's also a big reason why so many people suffer from the hallucinations paranoia etc, they really just have no background experience to deal with it. It's hell, and I empathize and understand those people. It's just some of us had SOMETHING wrong before schizophrenia, so adjusting to seeing hearing and feeling stuff isn't exactly too difficult. It's a slightly rough period, but it won't result in complete breakdowns, for most.
