todayilearned,fr5ks95,t1_fr5jtbt,1589910184.0,"My thoughts are that if you make more than 90% of the US population, you can reasonably be considered wealthy/rich. If you make more than 99.999% like billionaires, you’re in another class altogether. I don’t think billionaires existing makes those who have net worth of 1mil+ or income in the hundreds of thousands not rich, it just means that there is an added minority within the rich that are ultra-rich. On top of that, while there are those extreme examples of ultra-rich like the Warren Buffets and Jeff Bezos’s, there are hundreds of thousands of very wealthy people who aren’t at their level and who pay insane amounts of taxes. 

Again, as I stated initially, the issue is that wages for the average person are so low that they aren’t even eligible to be meaningfully taxed, not “the rich aren’t paying their fair share of taxes.” Our focus shouldn’t be on increasing taxes, that isn’t even a bandaid. The focus should be increasing wages for the bottom 50-75% of earners."

todayilearned,fr4yrus,t1_fr4s1qw,1589899409.0,"Also, I never argued that the 1% paid more income taxes than everyone, only that your source shows that the top 1% pays more than the bottom 90% which is factual and supported by both of our sources.

Look at this: https://www.ntu.org/foundation/tax-page/who-pays-income-taxes

The top 10% paid 70%. The top 25% paid 86%. So therefore, the bottom 75% paid only 14%. 

If you’re idea of middle class is “top 25% of income earners” then you’d be right. Otherwise, you’re losing this debate purely due to failed reading comprehension."

How is it not “half of our country doesn’t even contribute 1% of our nations tax money, let’s do something about that” instead of “let’s tax the rich more because it’s unfair that they are paying more than everyone else but at a smaller ratio of their income compared to everyone else even though rationally that means nothing at all but is a good talking point.”"

I don’t believe individuals earning under $100k should be taxed federally at all on that income (it barely makes a fraction of our federal income tax base anyway), but In most situations the effective tax rate they pay relative to a millionaire is irrelevant. The issue that’s important is what wages the rich are paying their employees, and how their tax revenue is contributing to society, not what percentage of income they pay taxes on. 

I agree that billionaires should be taxed more, but if someone nets 10 mil in a year, why does it matter if they are taxed at the same effective tax rate as someone else when they’re paying magnitudes more money overall?"

Brogress,fpplmfk,t1_fppktq4,1588804559.0,Thanks man. Yeah in the first pic I was really leaning in to let my bicep pop more and it produced a really unnatural result. I’m happy with my progress so far and my posture has actually improved significantly.
leangains,fpmhgtr,t3_gebgb1,1588733168.0,"People may disagree on the level of accuracy of MyFitnessPal, but in my opinion, as long as you’re reasonable and honest with what you input and there’s a semi-reliable selection for what you eat, MyFitnessPal should be sufficiently accurate to bulk or cut effectively. Definitely much better than nothing."

BulkOrCut,fpjsci6,t3_gdu9le,1588679597.0,"I’d say over 15% but under 19%, probably somewhere in between. If you cut slowly those abs should pop more. You look awesome man. Good work."

You and our other adopted grown adult son can share a bunk bed and I will let you have my last name and a $5 a month allowance. Alternatively you can have a race car bed.

BipolarReddit,fphzqs5,t3_gdholx,1588630850.0,Try contacting your prescribing doctor and leave an urgent message if need be. Next try setting up an urgent appointment with your school’s therapist. How long ago was the seroquel prescribed? If it was relatively recent and you have the instructions on how to take it from your doctor it may be a good idea to pick that up. You should contact your prescriber either way.
BipolarReddit,fphv6pl,t3_gdholx,1588628402.0,"You need to contact your psych doctor ASAP. What you’re describing likely requires some sort of medication intervention. Marijuana is barely a bandaid for what you’re going through. The fact that you’ve been engaging in what could certainly be described as risky behavior supports this. I’d urge you to seek professional help as soon as possible, even if it is a therapist through the school."

BulkOrCut,fpgu0le,t1_fpgsroj,1588609495.0,I’d wager it’ll fall between 13 and 16%. You definitely look more solid than fat and there’s some good definition but not so cut that I’d say below 13%.
BulkOrCut,fpgrm2q,t3_gddv0z,1588608239.0,Agreed about the nice bod. Either maintain or bulk and become a behemoth. Good looks bro.
BulkOrCut,fpg9red,t3_gda9ni,1588598009.0,"Unless you’re lifting heavy every day and doing full body workouts, if you bulk you will mainly put on fat. Probably mostly fat. If you cut, you will lose the fat but sacrifice part/most of the muscle gains you might have otherwise made depending on what kind of deficit you eat at. If you maintain and lift appropriately you could recomp some of the fat into muscle and, assuming you’re lifting right and eating a lot of protein, you will put on a lot more muscle than if you were cutting and less fat than If you were bulking, but you will minimize fat gain if done right.

This link puts you between 20-30% body fat. I’d wager closer to 30. What you do with that information depends on your goals. Do you want to be cut and look more muscular? If you bulk you won’t get that. Do you want to be massive and more imposing? Maintaining may help you there more than bulking. 

I’d say check out the r/leangains FAQ and community info just for some background info on calculating your TDEE/macros and different methods of gaining/losing weight or losing fat and gaining muscle."
