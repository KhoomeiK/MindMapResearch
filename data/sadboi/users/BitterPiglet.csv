Buddhism,fk96m14,t3_fh49ay,1583969777.0,"Here’s what I’ve learned and I’ll try and just stick with canonical material.

Form- The four great elements( matter) 
Feeling - Pleasure, Pain, Neutral
Perception - Mental notes, or labels applied to experiences.
Sankhara - Conditioned phenomena. In this case it’s often defined as 1. In and out breaths (bodily sankhara) 2. Directed and applied thought (verbal sankhara) and 3. Perception and feelings (mental sankhara)
Consciousness - There are six: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. 

Kudos for applying the paticcasamuppada. You’re on the right track but the point is best arrived at by practicing breath meditation. I would recommend reading a book called “With each and every breath”. Basically you play with these and learn how to fabricate (using sankhara, above) your experience of reality skillfully. Once you can fabricate with some proficiency then you can fabricate the path to dispassion towards all fabrications and attain awakening. Good job again for thinking this way!"

For your example of having four cars, if you did bear the burden of proof, it would be perfectly reasonable to accept your claim as true, even if it were a lie. Again this goes back to the fact the all we have to go off of when judging a truth claim is our senses. 

I'll cede to your point then that the cars example more falsifiable than atheism, but I want to note that this is only different than my idea because your criteria for calling something falsifiable seems to be a little different than mine. Not that either one of us is technically wrong here, it's just a little besides the main point I'm trying to make, which is this:

To rephrase it in your terms, the more falsifiable a statement or judgment of veracity is, the better. The less falsifiable something is, the more we should avoid making any judgment of veracity and instead evaluate the pragmatic outcome of whether the belief is harmful. Remember that since the existence of God is very unfalsifiable, a claim that he does exist is every bit as falsifiable as one that he doesn't exist. Make sense?"

atheism,ffdeuoj,t1_ffamzun,1579819396.0,"1. Alright, to be completely clear, I want to clarify that I'm taking the position that thing are falsifiable because our senses and reasoning ability present an accurate enough picture of reality to be reliably called upon to make judgments of truth. 

Now this will boil down to linguistics but let's get back to our conventional reality and our use of the word falsifiable. A falsifiable claim is a truth statement that can be settled by a straightforward method. For example, asserting that I am currently typing a comment on reddit can be easily verified or proven false by making an observation and seeing if the claim lines up. If it does, then it's true, if it doesn't than it isn't. Claims like ""it's raining"" or ""the sweater is green"" are fairly easy to test against reality and are thus termed ""falsifiable"". 

Now you can try and get philosophical and say that everything is falsifiable but the position is untenable because the way we innately interpret reality does not operate from the basis that everything is unfalsifiable. If that were true, we would never leave the house or even get up out of bed because we couldn't determine if any of our thoughts or perceptions or sensory input were real or not. But we do make those distinctions, and it works, so that's what we're working with.

Now, an unfalsifiable claim here is something that cannot be settled via any straightforward method. The existence of God, the afterlife, heaven, hell and the like fall squarely in this category. You can't prove god exists because there is no way to do so, neither is there a way to disprove, though people on either side of that debate will continue to try ad nauseum. The problem is that the criteria for determining the existence of god is going to be arbitrary or based on presence or lack of any evidence. Further, asserting the non-existence of God tends to be based entirely on a lack of evidence in support of, but that does not mean God doesn't exists, remember the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. 

So back to my original position. What I'm trying to say is, the only rational reason someone would have to purposefully make unfalsifiable claims is if it were to be of some benefit that outweighed the risk of doing so. Belief in the afterlife is a perfect example. I have no evidence that it exists and that if I do good, it will land me in heaven, but that belief will cause me to do virtuous actions and try to be good in that way, which is quite obviously better that saying the afterlife does not exist simply because I have no evidence that it does, and abandoning all the benefits that go with it. 

Evidence fails in these types of claim because of its complete lack of relevance. Since you cannot discern the truth of the matter, it becomes moot to use evidence to try and do so. Or, since you can't determine whether it's true or false, it's absurd to say that it's either and you should have reasons external to evidence (I.e. cost/benefit) for believing or disbelieving. Make sense?"
atheism,ffabcsg,t1_ff8kuy8,1579731571.0,"Hold on what do you mean?

1. You say you have no reservations about making unfalsifiable claims. This leads me to believe we don't have a mutual understanding of terms. Stating the existence or non-existence of a creator god is inherently unfalsifiable, but stating things like the sky is blue or that worms have no legs is falsifiable and thus is able to be proven or disproven. It's better then to stick with those claims when talking about truth statements, as an end can be reached about them. If you mean what you say, can you please explain to me further what you mean by us making unfalsifiable claims all the time, when I'm not entirely sure that that's true. 
2. Benefits in this specific case would mean a reduction in harm or reduction in potential harm. What I mean is that believing in an afterlife is not falsifiable but the case can be made that it would inspire virtuous behavior in those who believe, fearing hell and desiring heaven. Again that doesn't make it true but the argument here is that it's better than the alternative nihilism, which provides much less incentive to act virtuously. Nihilism itself is still unfalsifiable, we have to also remember, it can't be proven or disproven."

There is a very famous sutta the Mahasunnata sutta [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.122.than.html](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.122.than.html) that gives good advice on how to approach developing meditation on a large scale in one's life.

I'm against making of *any* unfalsifiable claims *unless* it can be shown to be of greater benefit than not doing so. I.e. one chooses to believe in God because it inspires virtue *or* asserting God does not exist out of the belief that it is more harmful to believe in God. In this case, if the leprechauns and unicorns belief is causing the society to be in harmony and peace and not commit violence, than I would argue at leaving it alone.

If it helps, you cannot prove God exists, but neither can you disprove it, it's unfalsifiable.

Many people (myself included) realize this and *come to* religion as a means of finding practical living advice and to establish a strong moral compass in the face of what seems to be an ocean of people's various views on the subject, most of which turn out to be questionable. I'm a Theravada Buddhist but I will say the vast majority of morality issues can be resolved from taking philosophy classes as well as logic and ethics, though I'm not sure most people have the will or means to do so. That being said though, belief in God (or in my case reincarnation) should be best viewed as a value statement instead of a truth statement, so as to avoid dogmatization and future conflict. Think of it like this: I don't know if there is an afterlife, but if I were to take a stance on it, reincarnation is better than eternalism (Christianity) or nihilism (Mainstream atheism), but again that does not make it true. it simply provides motivation for being virtuous, as well as some other practical benefits."
