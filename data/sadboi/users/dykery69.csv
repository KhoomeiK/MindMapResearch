BPD,fqitqh0,t3_gj1nob,1589400767.0,this makes me want to cry i always thought i was so crazy for this. like whenever im on the verge of an intense panic ill just like chant it to myself and sometimes even when like a minor inconvenience happens that triggers me i say it. my sister has noticed this and is always like u are home and it feel just infuriating bc it makes me feel like ill never find that stability or “home”. idk if home means the home i was at before the trauma or if im attached to that home bc of the trauma.. idk
