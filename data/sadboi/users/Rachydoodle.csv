Yes, I would just be using them as a stepping stone and to create a bit more resistance in my feet/ankles. 

Since my teacher suggested that I use them before she considers me going en pointe, I don’t really see a way around it? Like just turning up with pointe shoes one day would be ignoring her advice when she’s a great professional teacher and a physiotherapist.
