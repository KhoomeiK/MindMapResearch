Here's the problem. 
I want to play today and the only way I can is through his account. 
I'm supposed to get the animal crossing new horizons special edition this week in the mail, probably Thursday with all the Coronavirus stuff going around. It was supposed to come Monday but whatever. 
Anyway, my question is, if I play it on his account online on my Switch lite, is there anyway to transfer the save data from his account to my account when I get my physical copy in the mail? Would I just make sure my save data is connected to the cloud? Does anyone know if this is possible? 
Thanks for getting all the way to the end of this post and I hope someone can clarify this for me."
books,fked02y,t3_fhs183,1584110584.0,"So this book literally killed me. I was on vacation last year when I finished it by the pool, and I just closed my Kindle and felt this kind of emptiness. I honestly didn't know what to do with myself after I finished this book. I was made to read this book in elementary school and there are so many other books in school that I read but I don't feel like I really understood them because I was young. This one hit so hard though and the ending was so intense for me, especially when the experiment was wearing off and he deteriorated back into his original self. The slow change of the spelling of the words and the intelligence wearing off sent me spiraling."

It's like she is endlessly undermining my abilities to do well for myself. It's a form of misery loves company and I am trying to keep myself from getting lost in that. 
She also asks if I miss food, certain types of food, and will tell me to take it easy when I go to the gym.
