politics,fjh4o7x,t1_fjh1xdr,1583341168.0,"> I think within the south we saw Biden come out on top because the news cycles in those communities put this Socialist-Communist stain on Bernie. Fears that he wants so much government oversight and fears of how detrimental he would be to the market scared them into voting for someone safe.
> 

I think we saw Biden come out bc of strong support from black southerners starting in SC (shocker) and very low youth turnout (shocker). From my own anecdotal evidence living in rural, Trump country Virginia I haven't seen the socialist moniker attached to Bernie any more than in the national press.

The problem is that Biden DOES have some progressive policies (though not when compared to Bernie to be fair) he just has done a terrible job articulating them during the debates and putting out a coherent vision for the country's future. I think he has one but he really really needs. to do better getting the message out...

Ultimately though I agree you with you that Biden is a return to the pre-Trump status quo, but it appears that many Dems prefer that to a Sanders presidency."
