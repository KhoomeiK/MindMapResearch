That being said, I had a buddy while I was locked up that was a jew from Russia. I mean, he definitely got his ass beat a few times and a broken nose. But that was because of his big mouth, not that he was Jewish. People seemed to be a lot more tolerant; remember the code inmates vs guards. My cellie was black and was a member of a black street gang. He hung with the white guys. He and I were more considered  ""friends."" We weren't members but we were willing to hop in and help in a fight, and they were willing to do the same for us. 

It was all about respect. Respect is the most important thing. Treat everybody with respect and you'll hopefully be able to make enough friends to stay safe and teach you the ways.


Now what I've heard about maximum security prisons is different. But I've never experienced it so I cant say much.

Edit: sorry I got kind of off subject. But yeah for me it was more respect than race. Like I said my cellie (a black muslim) and I were friends the white guys. He already had a friendship with them before I got there. Then over time, I started getting friendly with the latin guys. It all started one morning when i sat down and had breakfast with the oldest latin guy in our area. We ended up having a lot in common. But after that day me and the Latin guys were tight.

AskReddit,fmfka6v,t1_fmffpf4,1586029021.0,"I try to be very open about my past, that way I dont repeat it. I have a history of addiction and first went to rehab at 15. Didn't get sober til this past August after going back to dallas county to sit out another DWI, because I just dont learn.

Previous record: conviction of possession of marijuana at 16, DWI at 19 that I ended up beating on a technicality.

Well, then I caught a possession of a controlled substance felony for meth and an unlawful possession of a firearm.
Being the arrogant meth head I was, I thought I'd skip jail. So I went on the run and ended up with like 3 or 4 warrants. Went to Oklahoma for a while and laid low. Actually went to a rehab out there too. But then I realized that I couldn't run forever and since the meth was a felony, texas would pay to extradite me from anywhere in the US. Called my lawyer and he arranged to for me to come turn myself in. They sentenced me to a year and a half. The absolute worst time of my life, but I deserved it. 

My lawyer kicks ass, works in the most prominent law form in north texas. He got the DA to take the controlled substance conviction off my record, somehow. I didn't ask. I paid him thousands, but that's pretty cheap to be a convicted felon who isnt technically a convicted felon.

I was out of state jail for maybe 6 months? I was doing more drugs than ever after that so the time frame is a little hazy. But shortly afterwards I got black out drunk, called myself an uber, hopped in my truck, and fell asleep at a red light. DWI and another unlawful possession of a firearm. I had already run out of meth, otherwise I wouldnt have fallen asleep. Also had some dabs in the truck but the cops missed em, so that was another felony they cold have added. 

Can you guess what I did? I went on the run, again. Stayed down in Houston for a while until I got scared and went back to Oklahoma. With the felony not technically on my record, the second firearm charge was also a misdemeanor this time too. Texas doesn't extradite for misdemeanors so I stayed up there for a while and got a few more warrants.

Then, again, I realized I had to turn myself in. Once again, my lawyer called the DA. Lawyer convinced em to send me to rehab and give me 3years probation. They agreed and I turned myself in to go to rehab. Well, the DA and Judge lied. I was immediately taken into custody and thrown in jail. They gave me 9 months for both of those. My lawyer was pissed. For the first 2 weeks I was in county this time, my lawyer was up at the courthouse every day. The monday of my 3rd week in jail I was told that I had court. Wasn't expecting that, I was already serving my sentence. Well my judge decided to change my sentence from 9 months to 90 days. And because the jail was overcrowded, they were giving 3 for 1 on time served. So I only spent a total of 30 days in jail for all that.

I asked my lawyer how he did that, and all he said was ""she regretted lying to you in official court documents."" I got out of county the last time in August.

Morals of the story: dont do drugs, dont drink and drive, guns dont normally mix well with drugs and alcohol, expensive lawyers are worth every penny, always keep your court documents, and it's not what you know that'll save you; its who you know and the connections you have.

 I hope that made sense, I'm running on about 3 hours of sleep so my mind isnt the sharpest right now. 

Edit; also officially got my drivers license back this week:)
Edit 2: forgot that I actually got 1 year  probation for the DWI at first but failed my first UA for meth, weed, and alcohol. I lasted a few weeks on probation before officially being on the run. I reported to my PO twice a week, never had a chance at passing that UA."

I'm sorry but when me and my ex-fiance called things off, I wasn't ready to date for over a year. Does everybody here really believe that 4 months is enough time to grieve the passing of their ""soul mate?""

She used him as a distraction from her grief. And he just kept up saying ""yeah you're right, we should live in the past.""

I could be wrong, but I think the problem isnt naming the kid, it's the fact that she's been living with the ghost of her late husband. Her refusal to accept that you can grieve, mourn, love, and miss the dead while still living for the future. From her actions, it looks like she cares more about the dead husband than her husband/family.

And now theres an innocent kid that's about to be wrapped up in all this. I agree that she is out of line, but I can't believe that over the past 4 years OP didn't see any of the red flags. I've met quite a few people who's spouses have died and they remarried. They have pictures in the house of them. They don't wear two wedding rings.

AskReddit,fmf2odw,t1_fmezmry,1586018723.0,"The part of the US that I'm in is a little different. Every state runs it their own way. In Texas, a crime that has a sentence of less than 1 year are misdemeanors. For a misdemeanor you will be held in the county jail, which is basically jail run by the city you are in. 

Then there are State Jails for State Jail Felonies. I got a state jail felony for firearms charges and was sentenced to a year and a half in the state jail. They're for crimes with sentences of 1-2 years, for a special conviction a judge can give that dates back to when Texas was a country. They are run by the state (Province, depending where you're at) and are generally nicer than county. 

Then, if you commit a crime with a sentence of over 5(maybe 3) are also felonies but you are sent to Prison, which is long term and very large. In Texas, our prisons are run by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which is a state (provincial) organization.

Then we also have what are called federal crimes. Those are basically the same thing as TDC prisons, but much nicer They're run by the federal government. There are a lot of things that could make it a federal crime or a normal felony, it all just depends on the crime and circumstances. 

That's the basic difference, now we also have minimal security prisons for white collar crimes (tax evasion and the like), intermediate security, maximum security (violent crimes, crimes against children, habitual criminals, etc).

And then we also have what is called the federal SuperMax prison in Colorado. Those are the highest security cells in the USA, if not the world. EL Chapo is currently in there, in a small cell 1 mile/1.61KM underneath a mountain. 

Now I'm not a lawyer or hardened criminal, just a drug addict who liked guns. So the majority of this is what I've read or heard but not experienced myself. Hope this makes sense!

Texas state jails are for felonies with a sentencing of 1-2 years, or for State Jail Felonies. When judges decide they want to make up their own sentencing, we call it State Jail Felony. Texas judges can get real mean"

And he's going to be born to a mother that is still living with the ghost of a guy that died years ago. If she cant process life right now, and puts off dealing with very important emotions for years, how do you think your child's life will be? In my experience, itll at least be pretty emotionally abusive. Because she doesn't know how to handle emotions. And that's not even mentioning the kids dad that enable his wife for years and pretends everything is good instead of dealing with the serious problems at hand.

I'm really sorry, I'm not trying to be an ass hole. I feel a lot of sympathy for you. But please don't ignore all these red flags, for the sake of your child. Your wife needs help. I couldn't do it if I were you, of course Jeremy will always be important, but I'd get real tired of knowing that my wife has been using me as a distraction from actually grieving. And of constantly being told that the ghost of her ex is and always will be more important to her than you are.

Texas State jails house 2 types of inmates, serving a sentence of 1-2 years, or those convicted of a state jail felony. A state jail felony is what we call it when the judge does whatever they want for sentencing, generally increasing drastically.

Sorry if I'm not being clear or sounding rude, I dont mean to be. Only got 3 hours of sleep and it's hard to keep my thoughts in line right now.

Edit: wanted to add this. The reason I specifically say public showers, and not your personal shower, is because generally your personal shower will stay dry for the majority of the day.

Our state jails house two kinds of inmates, those serving a sentence of 1-2 years, or when they are convicted of what we call a State Jail Felony. You see, our judges are the ultimate authority down here. If you've never been to Texas, trust me it's weird. We do have our Congress of course, but they see a minuscule amount of cases, which come from our judges. Then we have our Governor who has faith in our judges  while he's mobilizing our National Guard at the Mexico border. Whenever a judge decides to do whatever the hell they want for sentencing, it gets called a state jail felony. They generally increase the sentencing drastically, don't piss off your judge in Texas.

We have to have these conversations. What I was referring to is that when you even remotely associate yourself with a bigot (KKK member in my example) you are also labeled a bigot. Even if you are ""engaging intellectually"" as you put, with your 170pt IQ I'm sure. I live in the deep south, the KKK is still around and active.

I never had any control over who I've found attractive. If I could, my love life would be much simpler.

I do find it sad that we can't have these conversations without being labeled a bigot. This is how information spreads. It's basically like saying ""don't talk to KKK members."" But if other members of society just ignore those KKK members then how are they ever supposed to have a chance to change their views?

**I am in no way calling you a bigot or comparing you to a KKK member. I've been called a bigot for asking about an observation of other cultures. And I was only using the KKK as an EXTREME example to prove my point. I was just trying to say that we can't ""progress"" as a society without having these difficult and delicate conversations.
