ENFP,fmwffxo,t3_fxou84,1586445621.0,"This is highly relatable. It‚Äôs something i‚Äôm still working through myself. A lot of people have some type of commitment issues, it‚Äôs not uncommon. But what‚Äôs unique to you is where these issues stem from, what you actually feel when faced with the prospect of commitment, and the no-bullshit reason why you feel that way. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm still working on this. For me, progress looks like: although I‚Äôm still very scared to invest the real, vulnerable parts of me into something as uncertain as a relationship with another person, I‚Äôm making a conscious effort to lean in and do it anyways (but only with people I really feel like I can trust. before, it was no one.). 

ENFPs tend to have a difficult time exposing our real + true insides, typically because it‚Äôs such a stark contrast to what we usually present to people. I worry that when I show my darker sides, others won‚Äôt want to stick around because that‚Äôs not why they like me. 

It‚Äôs a huge relief, tho, to finally show this side to someone and they don‚Äôt hate you like you overhyped in your head."
ENFP,fmr2u8i,t3_fwm92s,1586312578.0,"Idk man i have two really good long-term ISTJ friends. 

I think they are hilarious. I love their dry, dark humor. And they are wicked smart - book smart AND street smart. I find them to be thoughtful and witty conversationalists. My absolute best study buddies in college. They are very disciplined and practical. They are fiercely protective of their loved ones. Great at providing practical advice. Good at planning and foresight. 

All of my ISTJs have talked me down from my own reckless impulses countless times. But, they have all also (begrudgingly) participated with me in my own reckless impulses countless times. They think it‚Äôs cute when i try to ‚Äúplan‚Äù things for the group, but always go along with my half-baked idea anyways (as long as it‚Äôs safe enough lol).

They are very slow to open up and emotions are more logical thoughts than feelings for them. You have to be comfortable operating on a logical level with ISTJs, i don‚Äôt push feelings/emotions much at all. I think it took ab 5 years of friendship for one of my ISTJs to tell me straight up (as in not masked in dark humor) that she sincerely cared ab me. So they do have emotions that‚Äôs just not what they focus on. 

All the things you said, i could definitely see them being that way at their worst. They are absolutely stubborn lol, but i don‚Äôt mind that. I am too lol."
