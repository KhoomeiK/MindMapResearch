BipolarReddit,f8p1sm8,t3_e18u86,1574694216.0,"I totally understand how you're feeling. The sun is going down before 5p here, and even if I have had a decent day mentally, the second the sun goes down, I'm spent. Normally this wouldn't bother me, as I'm more of a night person than a day person, but as others have said, this year in particular, the second the sun goes down I feel like my day is shot. I measure the day in productivity, and if I had to guess, the reason the sun going down is getting to me so bad is because I associate it with my kids going to bed (though they don't go down until after 8), and their bedtime is typically the cut-off for anything productive as I don't want to wake them up. 


Normally I don't put the Christmas tree and decorations up until Black Friday, since there is no way in hell I'm going out in public that day, but I started this morning by dropping the kids off at school, getting coffee, and coming home to rearrange the living room so I can put up the tree and decorate. Like others have mentioned, I'm hoping the lights/colors/spirit of Christmas will help me combat the seasonal fog that has washed over me."

BipolarReddit,f45o2f0,t3_djk6dj,1571386342.0,"I'm going through the same thing right now. I know good and damn well what I need to do to keep me stable, but I have no motivation to do the things and no energy to fight the lack of motivation. I make lists and set alarms to try to push myself, then end up ignoring them because it's just too hard. It's all I can do to even make myself take my meds because I don't want to get up and get a drink or open the drawer to grab my pill bag. 

I'll definitely be watching to see if anyone has suggestions, because struggle is real. I hope we all get the suggestions/answers/motivation we need to press on."

Luckily, every day it gets the tiniest bit better, but there are set-backs and reminders all the time.

BipolarReddit,ez5spo6,t3_d03ko7,1567704408.0,"Alarms work really well for me, I just have the problem of forgetting to set them. My boyfriend also helps by asking what time I took my last dose or what time I need to take them, or asking if I've taken them. I can remember to take them on my own about half the time, give or take. I keep them in a bag in the top of my night stand so they are in a convenient spot since I always have a drink in the bedroom, and they're in the bag so I can easily grab them to take with me if I think I'll be out of the house when I need to take them next. 

It might help to set yourself a goal; for example, ""if I take my meds on time every day for a week without missing any, I'll go to the movies."" Finding something you typically enjoy and using that as motivation to do what you don't care for can be rather helpful."
