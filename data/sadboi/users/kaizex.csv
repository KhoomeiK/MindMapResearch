AskReddit,fr5pql9,t1_fr4ttx1,1589912586.0,"This hit me like a brick my first day in japan (3 week solo trip that I took because I drunkenly purchased a ticket one night on a whim)

Step 1. Get to your first hotel. I suggest finding a ""western"" hotel if you're in a foreign country for your first night or two. Dont immediately do hostels or foreign style lodging. Those first 2 nights you're going to be homesick whether you like it or not, and a private bed is the best way I found to combat that. I cried for an hour or so before getting on my feet and out the door for step 2. 

Step 2. I planned activities for every day. Most of them got thrown out the window immediately as I would find more interesting things to do by walking around or meeting other travelers. But having plans to fall back on helped when I would get a bit nervous or bored. An active and busy mind is not going to worry about being alone in a new country, so your goal is to keep your mind constantly busy. Japan was great for this as there were a lot of hikes and temples and shrines to visit(literally hundreds no matter where you are). So if i ever found myself sitting id Google map the nearest shrines and go and visit a handful. 

Step 3. Meet people. Staying in hostels is a great way to do this. Some countries also have traveler subreddits(e.g /r/Japantravel) that have meet up threads specifically for meeting strangers for group activities. Just like in step 2N if you can keep yourself occupied and make new friends you start to shed the nervousness and worry. 

Step 4. Eat. Eat a lot. Eat the local food. Eat the McDonald's to see how its different from where you're from. Just eat everything. Im a firm believer that food brings the world together and is the best way to experience a culture. A full stomach also helps calm those nerves down. 

But this all starts with step 0. Just buy a ticket to a place you've always wanted to go(after the whole coronavirus thing cools off a bit). Just find a good cheap ticket. And go."
bartenders,fpofxss,t1_fpl2ncg,1588783832.0,"The place I work has its fair share of this.(not in NYC, another larger u.s city) Its a pretty popular after bar close and tourist spot so we get rushes of drunk people in. Our owner doesn't want to get sued, but above all else puts our safety first. If we can stop an altercation without getting direct, we should. But if someone pulls shit like this against other customers or staff, we get free reign to shut it down in whatever way possible. 

We also have a technique called the kitchen call though. Where we scream for the kitchen to get out there and all 8+ guys come put carrying whatever large item they can hold in their hands. So suddenly the fighter is surrounded by a team of pretty scary looking guys wielding pans. Thats our final nonviolent route. I've yet to see a case where we had the time to do a kitchen call continue to be violent.

But not long ago we had an employee beat a guy with a chair after he sucker punched a stranger at the next table and then punched his own girlfriend who tried to stop him and then punched the employee. 


Thats when I learned. Nobody looks tough on video when they're getting hit with a chair."

AskReddit,fics2xc,t1_fibjbj3,1582355603.0,"I voluntarily entered a psych ward 2 years ago due to being suicidal. 

I stayed 4 days. The problem was, I had excellent health insurance that paid the full bill ($2,500 per day). And my insurance would cover me indefinitely. 

I had to call my insurance daily because they'd discovered they had already attempted to book me for two weeks on an involuntary hold. A hold that shouldn't apply if you entered voluntarily and had no active plans to hurt others. 

""Therapy"" didnt exist. I saw my doctor for 5 minutes every 2 days. Other patients saw doctors once per week for 5 minutes. No personal therapy and group therapy was a joke. No progress could be made there. 

I was finally released when I told my insurance company to pull my coverage for that place. They sent a warning to the hospital that I wouldn't be covered for more than 5 days total. 

Lo and behold, they dropped the involuntary hold and let me go the next morning. 

Evidently this wasnt the first time theyd done this with this insurance companies customers(the insurance company was provided through the largest employer in the city). 

About 3 months later I got a bill for 15k from the hospital. Sent it to my insurance company, and they threatened to sue as the payment adjustment period had ended. It got left where it was and thanks to them, I got off without any extra bullshit or charges. (Thank you cigna. Legitimately I would be stuck in mental health prison if not for their wonderful staff). 

All of that is to say. Acting normal wont get you out. If it's a ward meant for the criminally insane, youccsnt act normal enough to out do your sentence. 

If it's a willing facility, they will still try to force you to stay to drain money from you. Because they legally can.

When I was a kid, before my dad got sick, every year at christmas time he would choose an employee(he was V.P of a small company of roughly 75 employees) and gift that family an entire christmas of gifts anonymously. We would go at like 11 pm and drop off a giant bag full of personalized gifts for everyone that live in the home. Kids, single dad, single mom, grandparents, whomever. He would make an anonymous call from a payphone on the way home to make sure they opened the door to get the gifts.

He would spend months getting to know the families better through normal conversation and then get them all things he felt they would enjoy and use. It was usually single parent homes, or occasionally homes he knew were struggling. He was also a champion of paying his lowest level of employee a good, fair wage. The president of the company however was a greedy fuck that he would have to fight on pay increases, but that's beside the point. He worked his way up there from the lowest paid job to VP. So he knew the struggle and wanted to make it easier. 

We weren't rich by any means. 5 kids and a wife, we were actually massively in debt I learned later in life.

Starting with the Robert Pattinson thing. Theres more factors than him being a man. He was a very famous movie star. Someone that's easy to put on a pedestal and believe in perfection. The old saying ""dont meet your heros"" exists for this reason. When we meet the people weve idolized, we realize that they're flawed and human too. We lose that perception of perfection that we created in our own heads.

Dont let this demoralize you. 

I'm not saying there arent women that close off when emotionally vulnerable men show their weakness. Those women exist. But they arent every woman. Those women are ones not worth wasting your time on. And sure, it may seem like a fucking *lot* of them are this way. 

But theres some who will stick around despite your traumas. Immediately building those walls will close you off to these women. The ones who you deserved to be with before becoming callous. (Not that you are. I'm speaking from my personal experience here). 

It's good you've learned a way to quickly learn who someone really is but at the end of the day. You're learning what you need and presenting it
 That's the important part.

Now we have a yes man as our manager, and worse yet, a manager who will force you to turn out your pockets if she believes you've got your cellphone in them. She operates off of fear.

I hadn't had anyone outside of my family actually celebrate my birthday in years. Girlfriends would always get me a small gift and that would be it. No get togethers or parties. If I tried to plan one, it usually ended up falling through. I had just kind of accepted that birthdays were now a non occasion. 

I just like seeing all of my friends. So she got everyone to agree to go to the bar I go to after work. We walked in and they all yelled surprise. A few people bought me drinks. It was nice. We all hung out for about 3 hours and then we headed back home. We get there and shes bought me a pack of kolaches. My favorite pastry from when I was a kid. Getting a dozen of them where I live now costs like 150 bucks. 

And then for dessert she brought out a pie with candles in it because she knew I didnt like cake but loved pie.

But it's alright. I've yet to be with a woman or man that doesnt understand it. It's a lot. Anxiety is normal. Just for what you have to and get back on there. Sometimes this includes giving the other person head in the meantime. Enjoy that shit. Sex is about mutual pleasure. Always try to make sure that you're giving them some and hope they see it the same way.  

Also, a pro tip from someone with frequent performance anxiety. Sleep next to someone who's up for it. Morning wood has been some of the most consistent for me in the middle of the night. After we have an experience they're happy with, (e.g sex during nonstop morning wood while I'm dead tired) my anxiety melts away. Consent is still key though. Always be sure to have it. Just because you did earlier in the night doesnt mean you do later on. Always make sure."

aww,fdoh975,t1_fdnqjib,1578605109.0,"For fast passes theres also an app that you can download and link to your tickets. That way while you're eating you can just browse what will be available after lunch. Sometimes people will cancel their rides about 30 minutes before the time slot, allowing you to snatch up a good ride.

My game plan was always to schedule my first 3 for early to mid day(really early was never long enough lines to worry about it but you still need to use all 3 before scheduling another).  Then after using my 3 mid day passes, I'd go and sit down or eat while watching the app like a hawk. Sometimes I'd still wait 1.5 hours for a ride, but id be doing it sitting inside or in the shade rather than standing in a crammed line. 

 I also recommend getting the wrist things too so you dont have to keep track of the ticket cards all the time. 15 bucks a piece but made everything super easy while in the park. 

The most popular rides (this was pre-starwars land) at the time were the avatar ride, the major roller coasters, the tower of terror, and space mountain. Oh and toy story land was pretty rough to get spots in. I highly recommend the slinky dog coaster though, especially later in the day/night. The toy story park lights up in a really unique and beautiful way, and the coaster gives you a great vantage point for it. 

As far as universal goes. I second that. And if you go right ad the park opens on an average day, you may be able to get on all of the Harry Potter rides before the lines show up without getting a fastpass. 100% worth waking up before the sun."

AskMen,fdeme9u,t1_fddktlh,1578342090.0,"Oh hey, I had a pretty similar situation. I was dating a girl when i was 18, she was 17 at the time. Wed dated a while and were pretty regularly hooking up. One weekend her parents left town for some trip and I had decided to make her a whole 3 course dinner from scratch. I bought the ingredients as well as some condoms for the post meal workout. 

It all went well, we had a nice dinner, hooked up, and hung out for 2-3 days. 

The next week I was supposed to spend a holiday with them (either 4th of July or new years I cant recall which. We were going to launch some fireworks). So I came over and waited for her dad to come home from work while we played some board games.

Around lunch time she gets a call from her dad. ""What's kaizex's last name?"" 

""What's his zip code""

""What store does he shop in""

My girlfriend asked why he was asking all these questions. Well it turns out in their house they re-use plastic shopping bags to carry their lunches. And my girlfriend had put the bags from our little weekend into the place with all of the same bags. 

The bags that still had my receipt on them. The receipt for the items that I paid for with my debit card. That had my name, the zipcode of the store, and most importantly, a charge for condoms on it. 

That's the bag that her dad brought his lunch in to work with that day. Cue 20 minutes of screaming coming through the phone and several death threats directed at me. I made a quick getaway before he got home. Over the course of the next 3 weeks I had to deal with him coming to my work to scream at me, dealing with the cops he had called on me for having sex with someone that's technically a minor(my state has a 3 year age gap allowance, so I was in the clear), and deal with him emotionally berating my girlfriend. 

Eventually her mom found out about the cops and threatened divorce if he didnt stop. She wasnt thrilled that I was having sex with her daughter, but she didnt believe that I deserved to have my life ruined over it. She was probably the only reason I didnt get my teeth kicked in honestly. 

We tried to make it work for a while, but eventually it became pretty clear that the tension on the relationship wasnt really something either of us could handle at the time."

AskMen,fdboasw,t3_ekhekp,1578259444.0,"Absolutely, but they're usually reserved for the early stages of a relationship. The first few dates, maybe a few months in. 

It's all the small things though. For example, I've gone on a few dates now with someone that works at a bar that I usually go to anyways. The other night I went in for a drink and she happened to be working, we talked a bit but it was busy so I was trying to mind my own and not bug her. 

I had my face in my phone when she came up behind me and gave me one of those really comforting hugs. I melted, butterflies in the stomach, the whole 9 yards. Every now and again I'd look back up and she'd look back at me and give a goofy grin. Bam, more butterflies.

It's still a new thing and we havent really discussed seriously dating. But damn she makes my heart skip beats sometimes. The butterflies come easily right now.

But as time goes on, and you get into an actual serious relationship, you start to lose the butterflies. in my experience, in a good, healthy relationship they get replaced with even better feelings. Warmth, comfort, and security. Instead of the rush and excitement it's more like getting home after a long day and crawling into your bed.  It's a feeling of where you've wanted to be that whole day.
