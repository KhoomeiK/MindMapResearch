Only a few coverage types were only ever useful, namely Ice, Fire, Ground, Grass. Rarely Electric, Flying and Rock were used, but the rest of the choices as coverage were complete garbage, and therefore had a perfectly good Pokemon instantly become a breject because it got HP Poison instead of Ice.

It does give a better incentive for fairness, in my opinion, I can't be bothered to constantly reset legendary encounters for HP Ice/Fire/Ground to hit a select few counters like Salamence, Ferrothron, or Heatran.

However, Pokemon that only had good coverage with Hidden Power are now up a creek without a paddle. Electric Pokemon will be hard done to in order to counter Dragons and many others will have no answer against bulky steel types like Ferrothorn, apart from the switch out.

Would say that the best way to use Sap Sipper Goodra is alongside a Pokemon with a quad weakness to Grass, namely Gastrodon, but this strategy could be seen a mile off on the team review. It could be good to force a switch in on a Ferrothorn as it is heavily reliant on Leech Seed stall to help with its recovery.

It is by far and away Goodra's best ability, because why not have an immunity?! Overall, I would say use Sap Sipper, but don't make a strategy around using the attack boosts as Goodra is a far bigger and better special attacker arsenal, then physical.

The mistake comes in writing out the matrix for the respective eigenvectors. The order of the eigenvectors must match up with the order of the eigenvalues in the matrix D.


For matrix D = [-12, 0; 0, 12], the corresponding eigenvector matrix needs to read as P = [9, 3; 1, 1], not as P = [3, 9; 1, 1]., as the eigenvector corresponding to lambda = -12 is [9, 1], and so on.


Also, try to double check that the three matrices P, D and P inverse do indeed multiply together to make A, i.e. A = PDP^(-1), or A = P^(-1)DP, or D = PAP^(-1).

cheatatmathhomework,evauzfr,t3_ciqmao,1564357967.0,"So we have two isosceles triangles, YXY and WYZ.

Let angle WXY = x

Therefore, angle XYW = x

Thus, angle XWY = 180 - 2x

Since the line XZ is straight, then angle YWZ = 2x

And angle WZY = 2x, as triangle WYZ is isosceles.




Now one thing that I didn't see mentioned was the relationships between lines XY and XZ...if they are the same length, then the triangle XYZ is isosceles overall too.

Therefore your desired angle XYZ = angle XZY

So from the three angles of triangle XYZ, we get 180 = 5x, and the final answer follows.

Hope this helps! :)"
