I was crying because I was scared, one of the police officers told me to grow up and stop crying. Looking back, I'm like, what kind of evil person tells that to a terrified child? The guy that threatened me was my NEIGHBOR!!  I was scared, I was only 14 and had no way of defending myself. This was in Fresno btw, so big surprise there/s. I know they aren't all like that, but there are definitely some bad apples. That doesn't compare to this awful and easily avoidable tragedy that this innocent man and his beautiful girlfriend endured. I hope that they get justice. I hope that there's enough anger and pressure from society that they are forced to do the right thing and set this innocent man free and punish the real criminals here."

Because if the clearance section of hot topic doesn't buy them the much needed attention they want, maybe faking (or even convincing themselves they have) a severe mental disorder will get them the attention and validation they crave. 

Also shitty ass mental health professionals that see a case that has similar traits to DID or OSDD and see some kind of unicorn that want clout as well. My previous therapist for example. It's dangerous and irresponsible. 

My own mother is the Munchausen type. So when I see it, I fucking see it. It's cringe. My asshole goes up to my throat when I see shit like that.

She's very independent, and I get it, but this isn't the time to act like that. Not only that, but him and I have a pact that only one of us goes out to get things we absolutely need, that being him 99.9% of the time.

But I can't control her, and I really shouldn't let things I can't control get to me. And yessss, I'm definitely going to keep a stuffed animal nearby and try those grounding techniques, it usually works with anything cold or minty but this time around I couldn't break out of the dissociation and insomnia.

Now that you mention it, I wouldn't be surprised if being hungry was part of it too.

I don't feel like I have the right to, considering I'm not the one going through it personally. I think perhaps holding it all in may be unhealthy.  It's hard because the only support that I have, really is my (amazing) therapist, and my realist boyfriend and my sister who is also very similar to my boyfriend, in that, they don't really know how to handle situations like mine and may be skeptical. Maybe that's just me too though, this whole thing feels weird, fake, cringy, bleh.

Anywho, you definitely got the nail on the head with the triggers. I have to definitely be more mindful of them and prepared when I'm around things that trigger a response. 

Maybe I should take a step back? I take a lot in from other people considering what I'm going through. I tend to be an outlet for venting, which isn't an issue by any means.

I've had one other time where I experienced something similar to this but was nothing as intense as this time. I feel more than ever before a responsibility to take better care of myself knowing that a child is involved. 

The only reason I really ever sought professional help was because I was dissociating heavily and wanted to be present with my two children. I always felt there was a child like part of me that existed, but now that it's been confirmed, I feel a responsibility towards her to help her feel safe and secure. I feel like I now have three children, which is totally okay with me. 

I felt her a bit last time I was in my therapy session, but nothing as intense as this. I will definitely try and figure out what it is that would make her feel safe and secure. How? I'm definitely not too sure, but I will definitely ask my therapist next time I see her if there's any way I can access her and ask. 

I'm so grateful for your advice and your openness to give me some insight on what helps you. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è"

I'm happy you're feeling a bit better now üòä 
I hope that it all works out in your favor and to the benefit of the child. 

And ohhhh boy SARB is no joke. They give you a few warnings here and there, but if it's bad enough the parent or guardian can get jail time and a hefty fine."

And thanks üòÅ she's completely blocked out, and I'm sure she'll stay out of my life because I have an insane amount of evidence of her neglect and abuse muahaha!!

Oh bummer. Poor kid though. That's gotta be rough. Our BPD mom would keep us all out of school all the time. Especially my youngest brother. 

I never understood that. We all fell behind really bad and even SARB got involved, but nothing ever came of it. Nothing ever came out of CPS visiting either. 

Good luck to you and I hope that someday soon you will be able to purge that unnecessary madness of of your life. ‚ô•Ô∏è"

I'm so sorry she's tormenting you like this. She sounds demented to the core. 

My BPD mom kept insisting to my brother(behind my back of course) and to her church buddies that she was going to go for GrAnPArEntZzz RiGgTSss..

She's obviously stupid because she literally can't do that haha!! Shes all talk.. But still it was infuriating and totally triggered me, so I can only imagine what you're thinking and going through. 

My heart is right there with you. ((hugs)) I hope you win this case, and you're able to block her out for life.

You deserve better ‚ô•Ô∏è"
