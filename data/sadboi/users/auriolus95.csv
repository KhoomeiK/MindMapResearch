NeckbeardNests,foem3e6,t3_g6snhf,1587707492.0,"i'm bipolar and during both manic and depressed phases have lived in pretty gross conditions, i don't come from a gross home or anything. I think the biggest thing is i feel really disconnected from it all, i can just phase it out and i still see it but it's like my brain filed it under the just ignore this tab and i can easily pretend it's not there. I often feel like a pair of floating eyes like i don't have a body and it's the same kind of feeling.. like i'm here in this gross mess but i don't really feel like i am. 

my absolute worst was in 2017 before i was diagnosed, i was manic, not sleeping, extremely paranoid and convinced i was telepathic living upstairs at my parents. they never came upstairs and i didn't clean for the whole year i lived there not working just sitting in my room on my laptop. the bathroom was disgusting and my room was filled with empty bottles and trash so bad you couldn't see the floor. i slept on a bare mattress among the trash and we had a mice infestation so they were in there too although my parents cat slept with me she mostly kept them away. my sister came to visit from across the country and i didn't clean so when she came upstairs.. she was so shocked she cried. my dad came upstairs and too and saw it and was very upset. i was extremely embarrassed because i think at that point i was seeing how bad it really was through their eyes and just did my best to get them back downstairs.

 i said i would clean and didn't for another 6 months and he never came up there again to check.  they didn't know how sick i was and that i was hallucinating and not sleeping and all that, i was very good at hiding when i saw them for a few minutes every day. I did clean it all up by myself when i left, i was nasty but i never left a place gross when i moved out.

I'm a lot better than I was, medication helps. you'd probably think i'm a disgusting overweight neckbeard or something but i'm actually a pretty normal looking girl, mental illness is a bitch."

AskReddit,fglxw51,t3_ez7gzr,1580913615.0,"when i was 20 i was the assistant manager at a pizza place and the owner (the manager) was going on vacation for 10 days which left me running the store during that time. the office autolocks and on the first fucking day i left my phone and the key in there. This was obviously a huge problem and being 20 i couldn't fathom having to go 10 days without my phone. I went home that night pretty flustered and  laid in bed thinking of different ways to get it back (the most obvious being hiring a locksmith but i was tight for cash due to excessive drinking and eating out) after thinking about it for awhile i had an incredible idea: The ceiling had those office like tiles that you can push up and i was thinking maybe they didn't build the wall all the way up to the real ceiling and i can climb through.. well i checked at work the next day and that was exactly the case, I felt confident and was very excited to put my plan into motion. there just so happened to be a ladder hanging out on the side of the apartment i lived in and it was only a 10 minute walk from work so after i closed i went and got the ladder and came back and set it up ready to james bond my ass into this shit. i got up the ladder and moved a few tiles and got myself so i was sitting on the top of the wall with my feet hanging into the office.

It was at this point that I realized it was a 7ft drop into the room and i'm scared of heights so i started freaking out a little.  i can't really lower myself in because despite moving the tiles there's still these aluminum rails and they're in my way so i elect to step over one of the rails and stand on the bookshelf and use it like a ladder to lower myself. BIG MISTAKE. as soon as i put my full weight on the bookshelf it collapsed and i fell backwards bending the aluminum frames and taking a few tiles with me. the office was in fucking shambles, everything that was on the giant bookshelf was all over the floor. plaster and dust and papers were everywhere. i knew i really fucked up but it was almost 4am at this point so i just grabbed the key and my phone, closed the store, returned the ladder and went to sleep.

Over the next week or so i cleaned the office little by little, gluing tiles back together and fixing the book shelf and putting everything back in it's approximate place. the real problem was the bent aluminum frame, i couldn't bend it back exactly the way it was so the tiles wouldn't fit properly and you could tell something was off. on the last day i ended up using string to tie the sagging parts in the frame to a wood beam above in the actual ceiling, it kinda worked but i knew he'd know and i was ready to be fired.

So he comes back and we talk about his vacation and i return the key it's all good, he goes into his office and i hold my breath....... minutes pass and it's just silence. orders come and i complete them and talk to customers and go on with my day. hours go by and finally he comes out and he says nothing about it... just treats everything as if it's normal. i'm still very nervous but starting to think maybe i got away with it, my shift ends and i go to clock out and as i do he looks at me and goes ""so.. it looks like a small animal fell through the roof in my office, would you happen to know anything about that?"" I immediately fess up, tell him the entire story and apologize profusely assuming i'd be fired. what actually happened was he laughed very hard and told me i was lucky because corporate had mandated our store for renovations, otherwise he'd have taken it out of my check. he gave me a pat on the back and sent me on my way home. i worked there for another year before moving back to my hometown for a girl (it didn't work out). so yeah that's my incredibly dumb tale that only me and my boss know. i never told anyone about it mostly because it highlights my own stupidity"

bipolar,f1q2hdc,t3_dag6ec,1569692320.0,your Quetiapine dose is way too low. 300mg is the minimum dose for the antipyschotic and mood stabilizing properties. that huge dose of gabapentin might help with the psychosis but it isn't going to stabilize your mood at all.
