> By increasing the supply of doctors, you lower their incomes in the long term (supply and demand) and that's contrary to your point of providing doctors more incentives. The cost of production isn't the problem in the US healthcare system.

Part of the reason why physician incomes are so high is to compensate for student loans, why not offer debt forgiveness in some way and circumvent this problem, while also providing an incentive? 

&#x200B;

From the video:

* There are no free markets in healthcare

Valid points and he also brings up the concept of the 'educated consumer' which undermines competition. I'll concede 

* There is no financial incentive for prevention in healthcare.

Great point and this also partially(ish) addresses one of my largest concerns with M4A, incentives. What is the incentive for hospitals to provide quality healthcare under M4A? Will government subsidies be allocated depending on quality assessment scores? 

Although I do think that the role of prevention in the case of diabetes and heart attacks is a bit overstated. There are plenty of people who are aware of the lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent the aforementioned yet still do not do so. Medicine can only go so far. 

He also goes on to state that this permits larger investments into healthy food access, cleaner environments, and promoting exercise. I fail to see how alleviating the healthcare system of a financial burden translates into reducing the consumption of fast-food (unhealthy food), reducing air and water pollution. Although I can see how this money could be put toward promoting exercise, however, I fail to see the incentive. 

* Hospitals and insurers collude

Definitely, and this is a strong argument for M4A alone. There's also a strong argument for a single-payer because of the costs associated with billing. These factors alone reduce doctor efficiency, and drive up costs. I fully agree here. 

* 65% of healthcare is already public

Interesting, I didn't know this. Definitely swings the argument in the favor of M4A. 

* We can't afford not to

It is true that we can not continue on the current path. He raises a very valid point that if M4A is enacted, then healthcare is no longer tied to employment, which frees people to do things they otherwise would not have been able to do.  

Interesting points, and really interesting, educational video. I appreciate the link and discussion. I've definitely been swung in the direction of M4A."

If you're reading this comment, and you intend on downvoting me, all I ask is that you reply with why you are downvoting me. I'd like to have a discussion on this topic and downvoting me with no reply does not facilitate a healthy debate.

Before I begin: **The healthcare system as a whole needs an overhaul, if it were me making the decisions I would offer more incentives to** ***doctors*** **(not healthcare execs) and build infrastructure (hospitals, outpatient offices) to support more patients.**

While healthcare does need an overhaul, doing what the OP in the picture says will only result in you and I paying more money for our healthcare. It is the same principle that underlies why health insurance as a whole goes up when more people become obese.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Economically speaking, healthcare is a scarce resource** and a for-profit system ensures that people who do not need healthcare are not going to the doctor unnecessarily. A for-profit system, unfortunately, does not ensure that everyone gets the healthcare they need.

**However, declaring healthcare as a 'right' does not change the fundamental laws of supply and demand that govern our economy today**. More people seeking out healthcare will only raise the demand while completely ignoring the lack of supply. Thus, leading to more stress on the healthcare system and lowering the quality of care.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You may ask?: If M4A isn't the solution, then what is?

Well I don't have a complete answer, and I'd be wary of anyone who says they do, but I have a start. **First, offer more incentives to doctors.** People are unable to seek out healthcare because there are not enough doctors in the US to provide such healthcare. This is in contrast with the rising standards for medical schools and residencies, and the lack of medical school seats and residency slots. **In summary, give people more reasons to become doctors.** This can be accomplished in the form of debt forgiveness.

**Second, build infrastructure to accommodate more doctors and medical students.** It is impossible to create more doctors if there are no places for these doctors to work. It is also foolish to do so because it will simply raise the medical school and residency admission standards which will, in turn, lessen the supply of doctors. Therefore, building and fundings hospitals, outpatient offices, and medical schools will help address the shortage of doctors.

**Now the question I don't have an answer to is: Where does this funding come from? The government? Investors?**

Please, let's all have a civilized discussion about this matter."

There is more social pressure placed on the boy to not hit a girl, for the reasons outlined by myself and many above (most notably the strength difference). However, this does not imply that girls are not taught to restrain from assaulting boys."
changemyview,fp2bfbf,t1_fp289aa,1588258790.0,"It is a double standard, but that doesn't mean that the man should hit the woman back. 2-3 years into puberty most boys are significantly stronger than their mothers, which puts the strength difference into a bit of perspective. With that sort of strength difference that teenager could \*easily\* put their mother in the hospital."
changemyview,fp2b86s,t1_fp1z0so,1588258686.0,"The difference in testosterone alone will make the average man significantly stronger than the average woman. I'd be hesitant to agree that the difference is less than decades ago simply because biology hasn't changed all that much. 

This is also dependent on how 'average' is defined. Does either party strength train? If so in 99.99% of cases the male will be significantly stronger."

If you have good insurance you can go to the ER and get an emergency script, or you can talk to your PCP and get an emergency script from them, since going to an ER right now isn’t a good idea. The L-Theanine, magnesium, and passionflower will be particularly helpful. 

If the withdrawal is becoming too severe, I don’t recommend this but alcohol will help reduce your symptoms. However, you should be prepared for the withdrawal to worsen when the alcohol wears off."

GetStudying,fot6s9i,t1_fot11vv,1588045934.0,"Caffeine pills are convenient but lack the polyphenols and other substances that are included in a cup of coffee. These substances play a role in producing the effects you desire while mitigating the side effects. In other words, caffeine and coffee are likely to be subjectively different.

You can also try an amino acid called l-theanine, it is found in green tea in small concentrations. You can use it with caffeine to mitigate the jitters, anxiety, and shaking; as well as improve concentration and alertness. I personally use caffeine and l-theanine in a 1:2 ratio, for example 100 mg of caffeine and 200 mg of l-theanine. Caffeine by itself gives me the same issues that you described, but with caffeine it’s like everyone else says it is but better. I highly recommend it.

Two people, Bob and Jill.

Bob is super macho and never cries. Bob never tells anyone how he feels and any positive emotion he has he stuffs down. If I show Bob a picture of a kitten according to this study he will feel *less* emotion. He may seem unfazed by it. 

Jill is his wife, Jill likes sitting down with Bob to watch movies and frequently cries at episodes of the Housewives without shame. If I show Jill a picture of a kitten she will feel a potent emotional response and may be overwhelmed by it."
