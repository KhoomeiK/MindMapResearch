Mass poverty only getting worse as the richest merely multiply their wealth via loopholes, and for what? We’re told to study and work hard, why? I don’t want to be some condescending prick who thinks “I went to college therefore I’m better than everyone.” (My family is proof enough of that) The only way I think people can be better is based on their morales and values, things people don’t really have anymore. 

  For most of my life I’ve been alone, I’m 20 and it only seems to be getting worse. I hate myself, I look at everyone walking around smiling and I hate them for their ability to feel the happiness I so envy. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone to the top of a parking garage begging myself mentally to just inch a little further off the edge. But after it is not uncommon for me to fail and just break down crying, so to stop those feelings from flooding I vape copious amounts of Cannabis. Lately that’s not even an option anymore, I commonly carry a pocketknife with me so that maybe the one time I have the balls I could do it.

  Life seems like nothing more than a trap, the few good moments I’ve had are short lived and very few. I truly wish I could fall asleep and never wake up, even though I may have a starting romantic interest I’m sure I’ll screw it up before anything good comes of it, maybe then I’ll be free to just die already.

I understand, I’m “young” but I’m tired of life, I’m also tired of people telling me there’s something to live for. I’m highly unattractive which is a non-starter for many social engagements, and this idea of things get better feels like another bs argument to keep me the obedient worker I should be. Well personally I’m done just being another pawn in this rigged game, I had a bad start so it’s simply time for me to reset the clock. We as the self destructive species we are may not even deserve the little we have, I simply hope someone can appreciate and relate to this outlook before I officially cast off."

Regardless another thing I know is that there are a lot of people who honestly probably shouldn’t, even though I know the experience of how unbearable the thought of the next 10 minutes may even be. 

   I think the reason things like suicides are increasing is because of our truly bullshit and fabricated society at this point in time. It’s also harder that ever to have a livable wage in the United States and many other places, all points aside the more time I give myself to think about why it all seems to suck, the more I feel like (with enough time to step back for a moment from the void I know I’ll fall into again) it can’t be my fault or your fault. So I may not know you but I hope in reading this maybe you can at least be more okay with yourself. 🤞

 The other thing is I’m a living paradox, in some ways I want to know if maybe we can all come together or just tear each other apart. Not knowing if I even had a chance before I start and likely fail my college classes as well is another. But once I fail like I think I will, I’ll be ready to go back into my abyss.

Like why would I want to live in a world where it’s normal to watch thousands of mass shooting, go on insta and post your perfect life when you’re just as empty as everyone else just wondering... “what tf am I doing here and is any of it worth anything?” Mass wealth inequality with everyone just trying to trap each other in what seems like a massive spiderweb of scams. I know for me weighing on things like that and all the personal issues that I just wish would go away is inching me ever closer towards my suicidal edge. 

I also saw a recent video of some person stomping on  a kitten, it’s lower legs and back most definitely had irreversible damage and unimaginable pain to the little guy. After that, I honestly couldn’t care less for this world... it’s not mine to live in, what’s the point of simply existing to exist? 

I think it’s time I fade into the background like everything else does eventually, besides what is it with everyone telling me it’s all worth it in the end? It isn’t and the feeing of aways having to escape whether that’d be through chemical means or my addiction to video games, uhhh... I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.

What I meant by that is both of those situations have about the same level of what I can tell logically are wrong and it’s a strong internal feeling that I have.

But I’m one to talk about scams considering I got hit by one on a dating app I once tried, never going back to that wasted time.

Jesus dude, devs understandably try to make the game easy enough for new players to join but the history with games like Battlefield 4 focusing on a fairly realistic and hardcore play style, that extra bit of challenge always got me hyped for the next time I could wake up and play again. I don’t feel that at all with BFV, it’s alright... graphics aren’t bad but maps are bland, origin ttk was better, the whole idea of more dynamic maps is deceased. Even though I wouldn’t have rated so highly on how dynamic it all felt, the fact we had giant military balloon ships was awesome, and the edges of building or gates could get demolished giving you a real sense of “Oh shit, tanks are rolling up I have to hide” Like I actually had some type of emotional preoccupation in trying to minimize my deaths, survive at all costs, and cause as much chaos as possible with flanks or good adaptation to what the enemy team tries to do. Plus armored trains were fun to both shoot from and try and sneak up to attack, but it was a nice way to give a losing team a little help.

I frequently join losing teams where the enemy has most if not all of the relevant spots, and getting wrecked by a sniper every 500ft or so you walked is not my thing."

“Slight rant warning, lengthy answer ahead”

It’s a logical reaction to be like, “ my gf just rode 4 other people’s dicks while we’re supposed to be a thing? Nah that’s bullshit, it makes my self worth go down because of your actions essentially say that I am not enough and other people should handle it.” So many people would say “you want them to handle it? That’s fine, but I’m not going to be sitting here like a fat cat paying for any shit or investing energy in someone who’ll throw me under the bus.” 

   Humans are complicated but lately there’s been a rapid trend of people who’ll emotionally take advantage of others, get what they want out of them (whether that’d be money, sex, or emotional stimulation) and simply discard the poor fuck without thinking twice about it, then those people get called the Thot’s or Simp’s. How in the fuck did we get to the point where that was the norm? 

    It’s bullshit, and it’s why after years of trying not to be alone and running after relationships because like many others, I am scared to be alone with myself and I at that point liked getting my ego stroked. Now I dislike that feeling, it’s a false sense of security, be true to yourself, stop putting your life on hold just to get some and grow up, that means learn to live with yourself and be comfortable with the silence and never ending thoughts. Realize that hiring someone to love you because you can’t do it leads to toxicity, and a whole spell of unhealthy shit. 

When I was in a relationship, I hated myself and second-guessed everything. Currently I’m alone (like everyone else, thanks Covid for helping others understand what my life is like day-to-day) but surprisingly I’m not that depressed, my anxiety is manageable I still struggle but I’m not usually a potential suicide risk anymore. Sure some ideation, but because I’m not gridlocked in a relationship I do whatever I want, whenever I want, no planning or real need for commitment. If I find someone, great, but no longer am I the one rushing to fulfill some basic biological instinct."

Added with this the ttk increase and being able to see soldiers from a mile away because they’re as blatant and easy to see as a highlighter in a group of sharpies... it doesn’t feel like the classic battlefield I remember. Even though BF 1 wasn’t one I liked very much, it still played like a battlefield game, at it’s core I liked some of the gameplay elements. Tie that into a lot of the previously rumored content being cut because the devs are being forced to maximize $$ instead of gameplay and community elements, you have yourself a full shit show of a game. 

Recently I got back into CoD, and I know what you’re going to say but let me just say this... at least the devs who worked on the Modern Warfare game kept almost all of the core elements, meaning it still feels like I’m playing a CoD game, not some $25-30 knock off of what made the legit or older games fun. Anyways no perpetual beta in the disguise of a full game there, just seeing the differences in how the shareholders/managers treat the games is disappointing on the BF front but keeping me still hopeful with other games... The only thing I’d say that really sucks is that although I want to, I can’t trust BF games and will now only wait until many reviews and the first few updates come out before I even consider it an option again."

The only real freedom every American unfortunately has, is the freedom to go fuck themselves and kill themselves. No wonder depression and similar issues are higher than ever before, and honestly nicotine, cannabis, and such other drugs are still widely available, you’ve only pushed an illegal market to make the most profit. If you don’t believe me look at the fucking US Prohibition in the past... all politicians dem. or repub. should have no right to take shit like that away. Used correctly they are simply coping mechanisms, if abused I think 18 year olds are developed enough to make those choices for themselves.

Also to maintain a balanced emotional state a fair dose of constant music, short but intense exercise, and THC.

   I used to be the same but with stronger bouts of depression and for the first time ever reaching the point where I nearly jumped off a 7-8 story garage (only in the beginning of this October) because of those feelings and intense loneliness, it was becoming comfortable with that loss of awareness that allows me to function now. I’ve also recently learned that now if I’m sober for an extended period of time (more than approx. 4 hrs) I am laser focused but I’m Impatient, ill tempered, and often end up having to externalize a lot of self-loathing which I haven’t found the cause of yet.
