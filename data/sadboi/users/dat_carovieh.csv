I used prepare carefully to have a balanced team. I normally try to have one person for every skill. I always play an Randy easy, I like Randy but I don’t want it to be to hard, so it’s easy. But the icesheet was not easy. Especially at the beginning. I made sure to give my pawns more wood and more survival meals then it’s standard, I also decided to give them two polar wolves because they fit on the ice sheet and they are good in fights. At the really beginning I thought it works out. I hunted everything on the map and cooked. I didn’t use fire but used electricity from the beginning.   
 At the first day Gill, my crafter hooked up with Tris, my cook. The same day he cheated on her with Patty, my builder. They broke up just at the beginning of the first winter.  
 I started to late trying to grow something inside so I had to reload after a while. I got some insects wandering the map at one point, I managed to hunt some down and ate them, didn’t sit well with Tris, my cook. But she managed. Of course the insect meat wouldn’t hold long. So I needed more and Randy just didn’t want to sent me raids. I thought that would help a bit, since humans are made of meat. But when it got critical again, Randy sent me two rescue pods. I gut their clothes because it has gotten really cold and I needed some more warm clothes, then I waited for them to die. My cook became even less happy but she hold herself up extremely good. I’m proud of her, she eventually had one or two breaks but it went pretty good. The whole time she also had to carry the weight of getting cheated on. Of course shortly before the rice was ready for harvest it began to rot and let me tell you, I reloaded that game so fast, because I’m not having it. I managed to get by until the first harvest was ready with the meat I got. I found some more animals and actually had one raid so I got another person. I got some Pemmikan from Traders and I got some trader who just died because of the cold. Some random wanderer joined, what are you doing on that ice sheet? Of course she was incapable of violence.   
 Finally I was able to build a bigger field and grew potatoes and after they were harvested I had finally enough food. Up to that point my female wolve had given birth to two cubs. Sadly all my wolves starved except one of the cubs. But I’m around day 40 now and I think it works out.   
 I got invited to some peace negotiations so I sent my new pawn, since she wasn’t that important for the colony. She absolutely blew it and got killed since she couldn’t defend herself. Not ideal, but apart from howling she was no good.   
 It was the most stressful Rimworld experience I ever had."
