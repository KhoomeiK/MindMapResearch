leaves,fqgu4cb,t3_gifl45,1589357201.0,"Wow, this is me 95%(except becoming a millionaire). Weed destroyed my life, I went to study abroad and I smoked weed pretty heavily for two years because of the loneliness and my inability to make friends And all it got me is a depression and a 1 month trip to psych ward for suicidal tendencies 3 months prior to me graduating. I got a second chance from my school because I was a pretty good student overall. I was 9 months clean but I relapsed... I am now 2 months sober again due to quarantine. I am considering moving back to my country after I graduate (hopefully) in 1 month, because all this country gave me is a lot of free time that I wasted with weed/alcohol, no girlfriend, a few friends. I just don't know what to do."

I always have been quite skinny fat, but it's gonna change soon, I try to work out and eat less junk food or quick sugar. I had that hairstyle all my teenage years, but as no hairdresser was open I decided to cut it altogether. It is quite hard for me to grow facial hair.
