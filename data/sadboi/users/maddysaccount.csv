13 is when I really started questioning myself. I had just gotten out of a relationship with a guy, and I wask heartbroken, but at the same time it felt kinda freeing. He had done nothing wrong, but just no longer being in a relationship with him felt like a good thing. I had also refused to kiss him out of ""fear that I'd do it wrong,"" but in reality I never wanted to. I started to look back on my life and I realized all the crushes I had previously had on girls, but I had brushed them off as ""just really wanting to be their best friend."" 

However, I didn't really allow myself to admit that I like girls until I turned 14. (Which I'm currently 14.) I identified as bisexual for about a month and then I realized that it felt wrong for some reason. I started questioning whether I was actually bi or if I was straight or even a lesbian, but I just told myself ""I've liked guys, so there is no way I could be a lesbian,"" but I knew I didn't have sexual attraction to guys, so I thought of myself as biromantic and homosexual. That's when I learned about comp het and I started comparing it to every guy I've ever been ""interested"" in. I realized that I have the same exact feelings and nervousness around every guy and it's way less likely to be romantic attraction and more likely just anxiety, so I allowed myself to admit that I'm, more likely than not, a lesbian and here I am."

AskLGBT,fqx469r,t3_gl29xj,1589725398.0,"I feel like there are two different kinds of trans. There is the psychological definition and the medical definition. The psychological definition is that you don't identify with the gender you are born with, while the medical definition is someone who has gone through, puberty-blockers, hormone therapy, or surgeries to transition to a different gender. By these definitions, every non-binary person would be psychologically trans, but not all of them would be medically trans. However, that doesn't mean their experience is any less valid considering many MTF or FTM trans people haven't medically transitioned for a multitude of reasons. So the short answer is yes, they are trans, but not necessarily medically.

Also, you don't have to want to medically transition to be trans. There are some people who aren't able to, or just don't want to for whatever reason and they are valid as well."

The biggest thing you can do to help her is loving her unconditionally. I constantly sit in fear that my parents will find out I'm gay and kick me out of the house, so the fact that she felt safe enough to come out to you is a good sign. Try to avoid misgendering her (which you seem to be doing great at, might I add) and use her new name and I think those things will greatly relieve her dysphoria. Also, maybe take her shopping or have one of those mom-daughter date things where you get your nails done or something like that. I know with the quarantines we can't really do that, so maybe even just sit down with her and talk about whatever girly things she wants to and paint each others nails. Its affordable and accessible. 

Also, Ace might have some other ideas on this."
