depression,flsrhgn,t3_fqq765,1585448975.0,Bruh same outta school and stressed with all the packets and work and me literally doing nothing to finish then except like one or two problems a day. Hating myself for lack of motivation but still not being motivated by not being motivated and getting no work done. And then this dude wants a thing with me but I love someone who I have no chance with but see no one else attractive bc I only love him. So ahahahahaha fml. I hate my me and my life.

cats,fjovqef,t3_fedew3,1583535801.0,I'd be so absolutely broken if I lost my cat. I'd be so hopeful that I'd check as often as I could. I'm so glad he's safe and not too badly injured. :)
cats,fhcvo8c,t1_fhc4hpy,1581471820.0,"Awwww I'm so sorry. Being a cat owner I totally understand the bond between you and your cat (or any pet really). They're like one of your own. It's always hard to lose a loved one and I'd be the same way: quality of life over making her stay. I'm glad she isn't in pain anymore. My friend recently had to put down his cat, who was younger than mine, younger than Nala even, but had severe kidney stones and they were told that even if he lasted the surgery he wouldn't last long after. Again I'm so sorry for your loss. Y'all are in my prayers. 🥺💔"

I'm sorry but from the 2 min I saw of this clip, I couldn't help but be satisfied to see her told the cold hard facts after she cheered which is SO disrespectful seeing this man break down right there. And now like she said, what has she done to help her child? Hey sweety, your daddy isn't here bc he doesn't care about us (which is a sad case I'm sorry to those and I've seen what it's done to my many friends who deal with this) and yet here this man is, not even the father and yet he'd still be willing to do all that for the child. This woman need to set herself straight as this is selfish at this point. Grown as woman acting a fool. My God."
