I wish there was a simple answer to your question, but there really isn't, nor should there be. In hindsight we can always say what should have be done, but looking forward we don't have that simplicity.

In my opinion that is a good thing. If things were destined, if there was a clear path, there would be no self-determination, no choice.

SuicideWatch,fh9s93s,t3_f21f0h,1581388427.0,"Hey, thank you for sharing.

Would you consider yourself disabled? Not sure how the laws are where you are but if classified so you could be cheap schooled labor.

So on to the meat of the matter. I love that your friends want to help but let's just be honest they can't. They have \*hopefully\* never been in the same mindset. From what you described it sounds a lot like a case of compounded bad luck limiting your ability to function as you were used to. 

So how to move on? First and foremost find a therapist. I think you have a lot of unresolved emotions about your inability to maintain a job. And your current behaviour reflects that. My guess is the suicidal thoughts you put on display here are more of a drunken cry for help then you would like to admit to yourself. You can't make sense of you're thoughts at the moment, so get some help with that."
SuicideWatch,fh9qsfw,t3_f2187x,1581387496.0,"If what you want is to find a partner then describing yourself as a incel with bad physical attributes is a very bad way to go ahead. Focus not on what you want but on whom you are. If you found peace in being single just stop caring about finding someone and be yourself so you can be found.

The world is not chad and brad. Far from it. If you cannot find stop seeking and be found."
SuicideWatch,fh9pz7t,t3_f20et7,1581386983.0,"Let me start off harsh. Smoking does not relieve stress. To a smoker the brain is only normally when inhibited by nicotine blocking your stress hormones, cause your body makes more and more cause you are blocking them. I still smoke though, I'm okay with the gamble and knowing what it does.

Onto the matters at hand. Paragraphs are a thing we would all like you to learn about, they are awesome. 

What kind of meds are you taking? Anti-Depressants? 

And do get back to school in fall. I haven't read you're history so there is a lot I don't know but getting a high-school degree is pretty much a requirement, else a GED or equivalent but it holds less weight."
SuicideWatch,fh9oz5e,t3_f20ewc,1581386322.0,"Hey, thank you for reaching out. What are you feeling? What has changed recently to make you feel differently?"
SuicideWatch,fh9ovbc,t3_f20phr,1581386252.0,"Contemplation, Idealization, Obsession, Planning. I think that is a generic route most take when dredged through what is the process of this mentally. From what you have shared it seems like you are contemplating your choices. Your therapist would be in breach of confidentiality is he shared with anyone until you were in the planning stage with concrete suggestions that action would be imminent. If he shared your thoughts with anyone before he'll most likely lose his license to practice if you act.

My advice would be to make clear with your therapist what stays in session and what does not (ethics codes on her sides require this from her but you might prefer it spoken through). And the world ain't going anywhere, we'll wait till you are good to go."
SuicideWatch,fh9nmzp,t1_fh9movk,1581385459.0,"How is your life in school? Are you sociable? Well Liked? A bit of a outcast? Or do you feel alone?

Why did you lose your desire to paint and draw? And I'll assume you're grades are dropping for the same reasons?

Not everyone can understand what you are going through. I'd always try to make these posts relatable by how I suffered during X period of time in my life. But I don't know where you are. 

With all that said, self harming is a bad practice that is quite addictive. Even though it may give you relieve now later in life minor stressors might want you to take the same actions for 'relief'. If possible at all you need to seek proffesional attention for that alone."

\-Freaking Ctrl-Enter does something different then anywhere else, I'll continue below-"
SuicideWatch,fh9mhil,t3_f20g6z,1581384718.0,Starting over is always the easy way out. I think you need to sit back for a bit and try to work on your empathy for a bit. I'm not a going to assume you are a sociopath but working on your empathy and understanding of emotions of others sounds like something you should want to do. See it as a project and reserve a few months for it.
SuicideWatch,fh9m2su,t3_f20hwh,1581384459.0,"What you've posted is all observational. None of it actionable. What do you need? How are they withholding it from you and how can we get it to you?

I.e. Right now might be shit but there is a solution, how do we get there?"
SuicideWatch,fh9lsgh,t3_f20kb0,1581384278.0,"Hey, it looks to me like you are a dealing with a mental conundrum. Would you mind sharing what is making want to go and what is making you stay? Given the choices you are pondering being a chicken is a bad analogy."
SuicideWatch,fg1e72j,t1_fg1d44g,1580425514.0,"\-Nods- I'm sorry you lost those years. It's a scar that is hard to heal. I'm very glad you are very aware of what happened. You're very much treatable. shout out my way if you really need it, but find something closer and more reliable. You're mentally mature in how you have approached this with me, if you did so with a therapist you could make a lot of progressive. You're not complex, we understand you, they might not, we do."
SuicideWatch,fg1cmmb,t1_fg1cg0x,1580424750.0,You are in to way too complex.
SuicideWatch,fg1cg0x,t1_fg1biyu,1580424661.0,"Whom the fuck told you that? It angers me that someone seeing would call you ""too complex"". You might be unique in your situation but that only means those lazy fucks need to spend more time on you. Giving what you said before they main claim it's beyond their training but that's BS. It should be in their training. The way I see it you've been dealt three shitty hands till now. It went wrong growing up, Nobody figured out you needed help going forward and then there was never a clear understanding between your trained muteness over the underlying issues and those not listening that there is a path forward."
SuicideWatch,fg1b52g,t1_fg19vsb,1580424031.0,"Even worse. Have you found capable help throughout your life? Have you been been able to adress your experiences as a adult? I'm so for asking a lot of questions, I want to know and understand."
