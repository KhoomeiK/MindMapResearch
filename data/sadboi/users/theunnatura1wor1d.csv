EDM,fhcyhss,t3_f2684j,1581473526.0,Good to see people promoting wearing earplugs at shows. I saw JOYRYDE in January and I felt like a dork wearing earplugs but it absolutely did my ears a world of service by not dealing with horrible ringing and pulsing afterwards. Tinnitus is very disruptive to live with and you definitely don't wanna risk permanent ear damage either. Hope more folks can take care of themselves when going to shows.
skrillex,fhcwsgq,t1_fh9bxc6,1581472500.0,Owsla goods' shipping has really gone down the shitter in the past 6 months lol it's really disappointing. It took almost 3 months for them to ship my stickers and leash to me but my shirt and hats got to me within two or three weeks when i ordered them in early 2019 (I live in Australia so international shipping takes a hot minute). Hopefully they'll improve their customer service in the new year bc it's not great atm.
skrillex,fh75ttv,t1_fh4xa9n,1581316230.0,This is probably an unpopular opinion but shaky recordings of shows have always felt more immersive imo. You don‚Äôt have to apologise for having a good time.

EDM,ffsmdg8,t3_euo40k,1580185362.0,"JOYRYDE's music is probably the most prolific example of Bass House. PersianVol pretty much described the genre perfectly in that it's heavy hitting, unpredictable and bassy while maintaining the dancey element of house music. I am not good with words but essentially if you want the heaviness of dubstep with a rhythmic beat you can vibe with then bass house is essentially that."
BringMeTheHorizon,ffsefoq,t3_euwz9w,1580179714.0,Their genre change genuinely doesn‚Äôt bother me and I‚Äôd rather see them have fun with their music than stagnate and be miserable about it.

BringMeTheHorizon,fcjvtwc,t3_ehbb48,1577707211.0,"It's so fucking weird and different I'm honestly digging the fuck out of it. Underground Big (HEADFULOFHYENA) is a chimera of wack shit with a hypnotic droning beat for 15 minutes and Oli just talking about whatever and I'm kind of obsessed with it.

You can tell they did whatever they want with \~GO TO\~ and the fact that it feels loose and unconstrained by people's expectations of them makes it comfortable to listen to. It's different bc they wanted it to be different and you can tell they had fun with it due to how random and sporadic it is. 

There Is A Hell / Suicide Season / Sempiternal / Edge of your Seat are always gonna be my favs just because their deathcore shit is what got me into them in the first place but seeing them continue to be more experimental with their music because they personally want to is dope."

It really looks like he learned to draw through his own music and the little ‚Äòspikes‚Äô that are outlining the creature remind me a lot of sound waves?
