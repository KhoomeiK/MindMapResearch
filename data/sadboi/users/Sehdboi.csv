depression,fiaovlu,t3_f791jw,1582305494.0," I think this quote sums it up perfectly. 

 ‚ÄúFor a long time in my life, I felt like I'd been living two different lives
Because the truth is, in the life that only I see, who I am, who I really am, is someone who struggles intensely with depression
Because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong
When you break up with your girlfriend, when you lose a loved one, when you don't get the job you wanted
But that's sadness, that's a natural thing, that's a natural human emotion
Real depression isn't being sad when something in you life goes wrong; real depression is being sad when everything in your life was going right‚Äù - Kevin Breel"
