> I am wondering what can be done so that restless thoughts dont arise in the first place, rather than having to do a technique everytime.

Unfortunately I think the answer is: nothing. We don't have power on our automatic thought process. That's simply how the brain is built I guess

> Thats the thing with a technique it doesnt always work i.e you have to also be calm enough etc. The restlessness might just be too intense to apply a technique.

> The distancing method you mention sounds good but shouldn't a person deal with the cause rather than the symptom, if they want a cure?

I completely agree. In fact the distancing is supposed to be just the first step of the process. After you reached the distance you are supposed to use your energy to build habits and do actions in the direction of what you value most and this in time is supposed to start an upward spiral that should get you out of the quicksands.

Just my 2 cents. I'm not a therapist or anything. Just someone struggling with chronic depression and anxiety looking for my own way out."
Stoicism,f2jc2zx,t3_ddl7sx,1570270385.0,"Very interesting question, this is something I'm struggling with daily due to my anxiety/depression.

What I found useful is something called ""cognitive distancing"", which in a few words means looking at your thoughts as if you were watching them played on a cinema screen with an attitude of detached curiosity.

It doesn't work every time for me but when I'm calm enough it does really help to keep some distance between yourself and your thoughts (another analogy is thinking about the thoughts as if they were being played on a radio in the background: you acknowledge them but don't get engaged with them).

I think this modern concept of ""cognitive distancing"" is very similar to the Stoic idea of ""suspending your judgement"" about impressions, which is a traditional Stoic practice.

Cognitive distancing or ""defusion"" is especially practiced, for instance, in ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) a ""third wave"" version of the cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) family.

My 2 cents."
depression,f1ttx1p,t3_daqfxg,1569749973.0,"Ok, we all hate it.

But it's there and the more you mentally fight it, the more it'll grow. If we ""fight"" our worst feelings they will get bigger and bigger.

What about letting go of the struggle instead?

Ok, bad feelings won't magically go away but at least we can get some relief, stepping aside from the constant struggle and focusing instead on something that can empower us just a little bit: doing something we like or healthy for us or meaningful.

That's my 2 cents and not even my own ideas of course.

Hope that helps"

I'm still feeling quite down. You say at times you are/were not sure of you have/had depression, well for me now that's quite obvious unfortunately: sleep, hunger, sex drive losses and that feeling of hopelessness and gloomy outlook on my life. This is definitely a low point for me.

I would like to/I'm trying not to give up to my gloomy ""impressions"" on almost every aspect of my life.

I'm reading a lot about ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), a ""cousin"" of CBT, and I found particularly encouraging the idea of learning to live according to your values despite how much ""negativity"" your ""mind"" is throwing at you.

I'm considering medications to alleviate my anxiety and insomnia but over a long time I've grown skeptical about therapists: in my experience over time I tend to hand over my life to them and give up my own responsibility: the therapist must be really ""strong"" not to fall into giving up too and I had several bad experiences with therapists over time.
