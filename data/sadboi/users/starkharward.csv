SuicideWatch,fgfg7e1,t3_ey793w,1580737823.0,There is an individual life for everyone. If everyone has to die after the departure of their loved one there won't be a human on earth.

SuicideWatch,ffkpxf2,t3_eu2cu9,1580026836.0,"There is definitely something good waiting for you. But there is catch .. you got to make that "" something good "" come to you.  Yes, whether you are alive or not the world is the same and it keeps going .. it stops for no one. So if you take your life, is that gonna change anything ? Nothing ! Your family will mourn but they too will move at some point of time. You are the hero of your life and this world is here for you. You see it through your eyes and your world ends with your end. So waiting for something good isn't an option. But you can turn your story around and make it a good one. And the change has to start from you. Depressed for long periods of time make people to lose any interest in life , perseverance,endurance and make us think we got to see if there is something good coming in our way. Nothing comes without effort. And you start to put effort to make yourself better mentally , physically, emotionally . 

If you see this world through a red colored glass it. Appears red. If you see through blue it appears blue. But the world is the same always. And the glass is our view , our mindset. You gotta change that view. When u feel better to view this world in a good mindset this world will be full of sunshines and rainbows. Good luck"

depression,fda6pvs,t3_ekf5ye,1578242354.0,"Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this. Sometimes people tend to be depressed without any reasons at all. Since you say you are having a tough life at school and family they might be a cause for your depression too. Deapression just doesnt pop up magically one day . It's a cumilative effect. Like wise you have started to feel bad overall. Iny experience depression is caUsed by life occurences and other one is medical causes. If you get depressed due to medical causes it might add to the real life bad experiences too. Being over weight is a major reason for low self esteem anxiousness etc. I would advice you to seek some medical advice regarding weight loss and find the root cause. For me it was insulin resistance and it messed me up badly physically and psychologically. Now I'm on medications I'm feeling better physically which is a confidence boost for me. I'm yet to visit my psychiatrist for the first time. To start fixing yourself first you need to cut the viscious circle at some point. Either with lifestyle changes or medical intervention. Don't feel bad much .coz everyone feels low and we arent odd.also try to socialize more its hard initally but for our betterment we have to do it and keep trying . :) Take care"

depression,fd7mcc1,t3_ek8cps,1578206681.0,Man i cant give you a hug online but i send a big virtual hug. You can get your control over your life again man. I'm a loner too. If you wanna talk tell me I'll dm you.
relationship_advice,fd7lzpq,t1_fd7kv06,1578206539.0,He might be over excited to have found a partner who likes him for who he is. It's a big thing for men without proper experiences. I know it will be bit too much for you to bear but don't mistake him too . Give him some time to normalise and also talk to him.i really wish people talk to the person before arriving at conclusions. Its him the only person in this world who can give your the best response and answer :) I'm sure he will explain his state and also will try to be normal :)
relationship_advice,fd7kfg4,t3_ek88ym,1578205879.0,Well since you asked him to give arest to texting and asked him to enjoy his day and text you later he might have felt bad that he might be over doing it. So he might have taken a back step to make sure he doest appear needy lol. He might see your texts. Might want to reply them immediately but would wait impatiently and then reply saying he is busy in his life lol.. it happens. The best thing is talk to him. Coz we men who don't have any priror experience in love or healthy relationships tend to over do over talk over nice haha and if the girl feels like it's too much on her we would try to talk very less even though we cant. you being a mature woman i hope you understand his situation and age and you should talk to him :) if thats the matter I'm sure he would be alright after sometime :)
relationship_advice,fd7dr2n,t3_ek8h2e,1578202896.0,"Talk to him and lash out at him, maybe he was stupid enough to think you might feel good seeing your parents or he thought doing a favour for your family to see your graduation coz it's every parents dream to see their kids graduate yeah. Don't listen to people who say he has don't something horrible eligible for divorce. Shout at him to a level where he understands how much you hated your family being there at graduation. Closely watch his response . If he responds casually with an i dont care attitude then you should think further , if he feels bad and has an explanation listen to it and decide. Haste makes waste."
SuicideWatch,fd7cgkw,t3_ek8h5s,1578202339.0,Venting helps a lot man. So are friends. Get some friends.
relationship_advice,fd7c5io,t1_fd7ai0z,1578202216.0,"Don't be a cat on the wall. It's more dangerous. Yeah it's not your duty to fix him, advice him to go to therapy. I hate women ghosting on me but I'll advice you to ghost him if he gets too demanding"
depression,fd7aryh,t3_ek8i84,1578201685.0,"Man do get some professional help. Many people are depressed not due to social conditions or relationships but due to some medical conditions ,say hormones for example. Man you have everything you can ask for. Don't waste your time being depressed. Seek medical advice asap. Happy new year"
depression,fd7ah5i,t3_ek8if0,1578201572.0,Thanks man. And a very happy new year to you :) with depression most of us tend to think we are a total loser and we aren't perfect while others are living their life and are perfect in every way. It took me years to understand it's not man. You are who you are. Don't focus on the negatives more because it's eats all the little confidence or self esteem we have. I wish you have agreat year ahead man :) take care
relationship_advice,fd7a0w4,t3_ek8ih7,1578201398.0,"He is so content and happy with the present situation and maybe he isn't not ready or might be anxious becusse marriage is a huge responsibility / comittment. Talk to him and tell him about your view. Because in a relationship there should be equal rights and views. I'm sure he would listen and give you the answers. Because he's the one who has the correct answer :) don't worry talk to him, whatever may happen it happens for good. Update me about the happenings :) good luck :)"
raisedbynarcissists,fd6ztuc,t3_ek0lbr,1578197743.0,"For narcissits it's always about money they spend. I love a dish called chicken biryani. When i ask my n dad to buy it for he he always used to buy lamb biryani which i dont like at all. When asked he would say it's costlier than chicken biryani! I would say what's the use in eating something which i dont like,instead i would eat the money directly and he would get super mad."
SuicideWatch,fd6yuwh,t3_ek5aj2,1578197418.0,I'm glad you have changed your mindset. Have the hope to end your problems.hope is the first point to start with.hope helps us to move further. May this new year be best for you . My best wishes
virgin,fd6xu4s,t1_fd6u41l,1578197060.0,"But I'm not a gay or bi, i was so horny and deaprate i lied I'm bi. I dont feel anything after seeing a pic of his cock other than being depressed how small mine is. I'm a straight guy actually. I feel bad for trying to explore as it just gave me more stress."
raisedbynarcissists,fd6x90z,t1_fd6vczv,1578196860.0,I m looking forward for my very first appointmenrt with a psychiatrist . Yeah it's gonna be. Journey which I'm looking forward to. Thanks for the advice man. And nice username btw :)
relationship_advice,fd6ws9o,t3_ek2z6j,1578196706.0,"Tell him, a guy who likes you will only be supportive to you :) good day"
raisedbynarcissists,fd6wfhn,t3_ek76fs,1578196582.0,"You are way better than my sister who gets around 30-50 missed calls from .my dad lol. Well earlier i used to think why she is acting like this. then when i came across articles about narcissim j found my parents are and I'm almost one by living withthem. No you dont have to pick their calls often like you are waiting for their call with your phone in your hand.thats what narcissists expect, to pick their call on the first ring , else they are gonna bombard you with missed calls and messages in the name of ""caring"" haha which is toxic. I'm very happy my sister has escaped them. She too moved out for school at 15 and i always thought she was odd and never synced with us. Now i understand why.because it was us who were odd not her. I feel sorry for hurting her and i couldn't ask sorry to her directly because of my narcissitic ego as i grew up seeing my dad don't wish or accept fault. But i kinda tell her in other ways and help her in getting better :) so you don't wanna feel any guilt at all. You are perfectly normal and it's the guilt that the narcissists embed in us to control us. Don't be guilty but talk to her when possible,tell her you will call her when possible . Slowly she will get used to it lile my parents. Have a good day :)"
virgin,fd6uopg,t1_fd6u9yc,1578195944.0,I'm not a guy or bi first of all but i fot freaked out when i saw his dick. Because i already am not getting any kind of positive response from women  and this thing just made me think how small mine is and how it's gonna affect my chances of getting a girl and maybe not satisfying her.
virgin,fd6s5vc,t1_fd6qto8,1578195049.0,Yeah. Thanks man
relationship_advice,fd6rv2s,t3_ejwxhr,1578194949.0,Whenever i hear or read about girls making the first move it really makes me happy inside. At the same time i think is it real because it never happened to me. Nor i got any positive responses from women i approached. I insist more women to make the first move because there might be many guys anxious and shy. I'm happy for the dude :) good luck ahead. My best wishes :)
virgin,fd6qa6l,t1_fd6kwos,1578194414.0,They say size doesn't matter but i dont know how true it is. It was with that hope i never felt bad. I didnt text him and removed him from my friends list. There is so much emotions ans queations going into mind man
raisedbynarcissists,fd6pyxd,t1_fd69t39,1578194303.0,"You might have developed a radar kinda thing which helps you find what a person thinks by just looking at their face . We can detect Even small changes because when rised and lived with narcissitis for a life time we get to know their moods by just their faces and the words. And a bad habit to please everyone. That makes me a nice guy no one wants lol. All i have heard from women was you are a nice guy but be yourself. I dont know how to be myself because I'm that fake naturally. After a brief arguments and fights and clash for few years with my dad i stumbled upon narcissism and i found my dad was a full blown one and my mom had become one and the worst part is i have become one ! And i really feel bad about. Myself. My dad never let me expose to world by always saying how bad the world is and how i cant be able to do anything alone. Now i am trying to break the clutches one by one as i am kinda getting better at the mind game. You wanna do something with them don't tell them straight away it will lead to fights , instead do it step by step. I'm currently pleasing my parenrs and saying what they wanna hear ,boost them etc and I'm also trying to get out of it. In that way it doesn't get a nasty family fued. I seriously wish for moving our but I'm still financially dependant but i have vowed to be financially independant by the end of this year. Coz that's the thing most narcissitis use to control grown up kids. No matter how better i perform all i hear is you are useless, you are doing useless shit etc. To keep their control over me always. I'm glad you are out of it. Develope  your narcissit radar because narcissits will feel more friendly and syncjng with you as we lived our lives with it. and stay away from narcissits.hope your therapy helps and you get releived :) wish me good luck for my first therapy session :) thanks"
raisedbynarcissists,fd2yi8l,t3_ejwmkr,1578152949.0,I'm still stuck with my n parents but my sister successfully evaded them. she got fi ancially stable and she just refused to speak. In the end my parents gave up and now they talk with fear lolol. But me myself i couldn't do much as i lived my entire life with them while my sister lived until 14. I have become half narcissit myself along time. So if your dad is really bothering you with talks . Tell him to not interefere. Im sure it will become a conflict but you gotta see what he has to say.
raisedbynarcissists,fd2xbgb,t3_ejs3fe,1578152599.0,I'm already worried and kinda sure i am becoming a narcissit. And im worried about it very much. I wanna be normal. Be lovning be happy spread love and want a sweet family for myself. But I'm worried If i might hurt a girl who ll love me. There isn't one in this world who loves me but i want that person to be safe and i love that imaginary person so much that she doesn't come near me in real life. Yet i am so badly looking for love. It's fucked up. All i want to do is band my head to the door. I'm glad I'll be visiting a psychiatrist soon. I'm ready for change and want to erase the memories of my n dad. I just want love man. Which i never ever experienced.
raisedbynarcissists,fd2wrp2,t3_ejv5k9,1578152389.0,The abuse just makes you stressed to such an extent that you would just forget it or forget it partially after few days or months. You ll lose touch with reality and i feel a pain in my head whenever i think of it.
raisedbynarcissists,fd2wicz,t3_ejp15i,1578152259.0,I dont wanna erase them as i would lose my years but u wanna use a strainer to seperate the shit out of my brain and be clear. I really wish my parents understand me a tiny bit. But they don't . I'm trying to do a new start but it's hard but i hope i can
depression,fd2v6n8,t3_ejvcf6,1578151914.0,Man I'm 25 i still did nothing for my personal life. I feel like i just lost my and losing my youth fast. While no girl seems to be interested to talk to me i dont see how am i gonna have a love or sex even though i forcemyself to socialise lol. I'm gald you realised it pretty earlier. Better late than never bro. Start fixing your life. Good luck man cheers

relationship_advice,fd1pltt,t3_ejp970,1578134822.0,"Man I'm not mature enough to advice you on this but I'll share my opinion/ view . Many in here say she might be making this up due to her medications. It might be true or not . If it's really true,it means your wife did make a mistake but she is now leaving us all and she wants to confess it to you to take some weight of her chest. As a husband it might be more plainful than her diagnosis.but now you should act like a friend. She is leaving and don't take her words to ur heart now. Instead be her friend, be with her in her time and be a support to her. She already has bad memories ,make sure you are going to give her few good memories to take with. I know it's hard man. But from humanity perspective let's care for her now. You have time to cry for everything together later. Be with her. If you were her friend what would you have done ? You would have chuckled and laughed just take it as it for now . Be supportive and make sure you tell her she is still your love and yoh love her no matter what. Everyone makes mistKes in life bro. Be there for her now. My prayers for you both."
sex,fd1no28,t3_ejt1rf,1578133903.0,Man I'm happy for you. And I'm also jealous af lol. Ok my best wishes for you and your partner dude :) keep her like your princess ♥️
