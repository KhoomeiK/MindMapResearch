BPD,fjdgc5r,t1_fjd8kkl,1583252444.0,That’s why OP wrote “sometimes” and not “all the time”... imo you’re projecting your negative experience with your borderline gf onto all of us with borderline. Being angry that our feelings are always invalidated does NOT equal being too proud to say sorry.
AMA,f916db4,t1_f915jly,1574983158.0,"I was an organizer of a certain event in one of the malls (a very harmless family-friendly event) It was prayer time so they asked me to shut down the event temporarily and tell everyone to go pray. When I tried to argue with them and tell them that’s not possible, they arrested me and a couple of my buddies. 

Problem is, I’m a devout Muslim and I would’ve taken a break to pray anyway. So are many of my friends. It just sounds absurd to shut down an a entire event to make everyone pray. 

I pointed out to them that some of the people in the event weren’t Muslim, and some were children, and some were women who were on their periods (in Islam you don’t have to pray if you’re on your period). They just arrested me for that."

AmItheAsshole,ettbq6v,t1_ett98tq,1563172175.0,He doesn’t want a loan. He wants me to buy his apartment for double the price. (With no intention to give back anything)
AmItheAsshole,ett70et,t1_ett4fzh,1563166781.0,"I’m not sure how these straits sound to others, but in my country they’re real. He keeps saying that I conned him out of my father’s inheritance (even though we all inherited fairly according to law, my father had no will) but my dear late father barely had 100k worth of assets to his name. Even if I conned him, which I didn’t, I would’ve conned him out of 10,000 dollars. I don’t see how I owe him 50k for “conning” him. The inheritance is another card he pulled out and I’m truly questioning myself right now."
AmItheAsshole,ett6pa9,t1_etsnyop,1563166458.0,"That’s not possible in the country I live in. I doubt he’ll be jailed because the laws are very loose, but all his assets were frozen and he can’t leave the country."
AmItheAsshole,ett6k9t,t1_ett3isp,1563166314.0,You’re absolutely right. Sometimes I’m glad that my parents (May they Rest In Peace) are not alive to see this. They cared so much about the bond between their children.
AmItheAsshole,ett6ezi,t1_etsg41r,1563166164.0,"I don’t have much liquid cash on me right now, but I do have a lot of assets. I already own my house (a villa), and another house that I rent out. I also own 3 different apartments in 3 different cities and an apartment complex of my own, and about 5-7 lands worth about 50k-100k each. I also own a shipping truck that I rent out for batch transportation. I recently bought an office floor so that my children would have the option to start their own business when they graduate, and until then, I’m renting it out to a media company. I also have my job (the one I’ll be retiring from, but I’m not planning to retire any time soon), and it pays about 800k annually. 

It does sound like I’m sitting on a lot of money and holding out on him, which makes me feel like an asshole, but I need to liquidate some of my assets to get him 100k, which I’m hesitant to do because: 

1) All the investments I have are for my children. I bought my lands a couple of decades ago and they doubled in price, and I’m planning to pass them down to my children or sell them in case things suddenly go awry so that I still have enough money to pay for my children’s education. 

2) I cannot sell the office floor because I also bought it for my children and I promised them that they’ll have a place to work in when they graduate. 

3) The apartments are for my family to reside in (3 different apartments in 3 different cities) when we’re visiting these cities (which we do very often) 

4) The apartment complex is still under construction and the truck is indispensable. 

5) I obviously can’t sell my house, and the other house is worth way more than 115k and it brings me a lot of money, so I can’t give that up either. 

6) I need about 200k annually for my children’s university fees (they’re 3). It’s July and I’m not sure I’d be able to raise that money by the new semester (September) unless I sell one of my assets, which I don’t want to do because it’s an investment for the future. 

My children are the light of my life. Everything I worked for I got for them. That was my motive all these years; I never intended to earn anything for myself, just for my children. My greatest fear is dying and leaving them penniless. I don’t like to take risks and say I’ll earn the money back, because I don’t know if something were to happen to me. It sounds pessimistic, but you have to take all scenarios into account. They’re too young to handle my investments, and my wife isn’t really skilled in that either, so I’m fairly certain someone will trick them out of their money (most possibly my own siblings) if I were to die. I try to teach and warn them as much as possible, but we live in a country with so many loose laws and easily bribable people."

AmItheAsshole,etrwg1l,t1_etrvqvs,1563130632.0,"My wife thinks so too, but it’s hard for me to think about it logically. It hurt me much more than I’d like to admit, but people say all types of things when they’re financially stressed and I’m trying not to blame him. 

I just want to win my brother back. He likes marzipan, so I sent him some with our sister who came to visit me in the country I live in (me and him don’t live in the same country anymore), but he refused to accept them from our sister. He said that he doesn’t want anything from me. My blood pressure went up really high that day and my wife was seriously worried something would happen to me."
AmItheAsshole,etrvkm8,t1_etruhzp,1563130041.0,"Usually I gave him money by buying his property for way more than it’s worth, but this time he wants me to buy his 50k property for 115k, which is ridiculous. But technically, I’d be giving him 65k, if I was able to sell his property again (which is very difficult at this time)."
AmItheAsshole,etrvb7j,t1_etrtz6w,1563129875.0,"My father and most of my siblings pitched in to help raise the money for me, so I’d say he gave maybe 2,000-5,000 dollars, but that was back in the 80s and maybe this amount was worth more. 

I’ve helped him out with his lands and business over the years and even bought some of his assets when he needed money, but 100k is too much for me this time. 

It was not a life-threatening situation, and honestly I don’t even remember it, but it wasn’t the only thing he mentioned. He kept mentioning instances of how he took care of me as a child and how he was nice to me and ended these sentences with something alone the lines of “what a waste”. It truly breaks my heart. I don’t want him to think I’m ungrateful because I truly am."
