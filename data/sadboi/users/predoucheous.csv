JaneTheVirginCW,fpoei5c,t1_fpn9r8r,1588783146.0,">I didn’t think about that before, but it’s true tho. Totally agree. But I think the deal was that Jane goes th**r**ough SOOO MUCH stuff during the fi**fth** season and I guess it was too **many** things to talk about in that season.

>For me, one of the biggest problems in JTV is that they focus so much **on** Jane's story and because of that the story of some interesting secondary characters like JR doesn’t really exist(not plural) in the series.

>P.**S**.: Sorry if my english is kind of bad but it’s my second language and I’m still trying to improve

Hello! You mentioned that you were trying to improve, so I went through and corrected the (incredibly few) mistakes you made, just to help you refine your skills! I hope this doesn't come off as rude; I only did it because I'm trying to learn Spanish and I'd love for people to correct me, too.

&#x200B;

Edit: I tried to mark them all in bold, but some of them messed up with asterisks. Removed the asterisks for clarity (but now some aren't bold, so you'll just have to read through to catch the last correction) :)"
legaladvice,fkz5lin,t1_fkz1osq,1584663288.0,Have filed a charge to the NLRB. I’ll call tomorrow to figure out how to appeal it. It took them an entire month to deny me so this is increasingly inconvenient.
legaladvice,fi12of2,t1_fi11zr9,1582049424.0,"This was exceedingly validating to read. I filed with the NRLB and also for unemployment. I plan to have a friend help me compose an account of what happened. My employer said that ""my account did not corroborate with anyone elses"" which was particularly confusing as I have not lied at any point, so I assume there was some misunderstanding and that my co-workers aren't actually terrible people. I am very stressed that I've done something wrong at some point here but am trying to stay calm about the whole thing. Thank you to everyone who has commented, it made a bad day a little easier to navigate."

I don't know if your family can give you what you need from them at this point. Hopefully you can spend time away from them at some point and stop feeling like people in your life define you by this action. You were 8. You had the best of intentions and no one can fault you for what happened. I hope you find the healing you need."
