And put the other 16K into a S&S ISA all in to $KO or a high paying dividends share. That's approx $640 a year coming back in Dividends. 400 shares Dividends at $.40 a quarter per share.  
$1.60 a year per share in dividends. 

Finally put the rest in a Moneybox 90 day notice at 1.65% and sit comfortably for a few years until you decide if you want a house."

I basically just got a lucky break and sold before I would have lost 35% of my Vanguard/Shares/Stock portfolios.
This was a pure whim and I acted quickly after reading about China in late December. 

I also bought into some bitcoin as a hedge when it went closer to $3000 and also put my pensions into bonds. 

Daily I'm saving loads of money. I used to spend so much on lunch and just shopping in the city because of boredom."

AskReddit,f6c077r,t3_dqn66a,1572780642.0,"Guy here. The worst thing I ever had was I was at a girl's new year party. And had drinks and there was no way I could drive home as it was middle of nowhere/drank too much. She kept hinting that I could sleep somewhere if there was enough space and nobody else stayed.
////////
She put a roll mat on her bedroom floor, literally feet from her bed and my ass just slept there until the morning. I didn't even make a move.
////////
I was thinking about it the other day about how stupid 17 year old me was at taking hints. The first and last time I ever friend zoned myself.
////////
We are still really good friends today, 8 years later. I asked her about it and she said I was so bad at reading girls when I was younger. She said she had a crush on me really hard, but never said anything back then. kind of glad I didn't go ahead with her. Because she is basically my best friend now and I couldn't be without her."
