AskReddit,evxngx3,t3_clrnsf,1564899033.0,"I suffer from long term, severe depression. I can't speak for everyone, but when it gets bad there is no hiding it. I'm not here to invalidate anyone's struggles or experiences, of course, but typically people I know who are afflicted by debilitating depression, including myself, do not even care about trying to hide it. 

When I get in a really, really bad funk, I won't shower, I can't eat, and I have no interest in doing absolutely anything or talking to anyone, even those I love most. If someone asks me what's wrong, I will make up an excuse, but I never spend time trying to appear happy. I just don't have the energy. When I get into a bad bout of depression, I will sob continuously for about a day or two and then I'm out of energy to cry.

Everyone seems to think depression is this ""hidden illness."" While that is often true, it is just as often not. The signs are there, and if you think someone is suffering, you should reach out to them. Don't wait."
