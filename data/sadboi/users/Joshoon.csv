When I keep the iPhone on a charger for a while, both the adapter and the battery don't get warm at all, which might be a sign that the battery isn't charging at all.

This 385 euro's will be reset every year.  
So for example if I needed medical help which costed 400 euro's, I have to pay 385 euro's myself and the 15 euro's leftover will be insured.

If I need medical help or medicines in the same year again, it will be all covered by the insurance.  
Until the new year, then I have to pay 385 euro's again to get the rest insured.  
It's weird and f\*ed up, I know.
