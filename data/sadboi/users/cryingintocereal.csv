They also represent consciousness to me, and I like drawing them as symbolic of that anyway, but when I’ve had psychotic episodes I become really concerned with and hyperaware of my own consciousness so drawing something that articulates that is like, cathartic."

schizophrenia,fop123p,t3_g8oeos,1587950737.0,"When I first read about [Self Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-disorder) it blew my mind because it articulated a lot of things that made me feel fundamentally different and isolated from the typical human experience and it was really strange reading about it because of how specific it seemed to me. Especially this part:

* In the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the minimal self and the self-world structure are ""constantly challenged, unstable, and oscillating,"" causing anomalous self-experiences known as self-disorders. These involve the person feeling as if they lack an identity, as if they are not really existing, that the sense of their experiences being their own (the ""mine-ness"" of their experiential world) is failing or diminishing, as if their inner experiences are no longer private, and that they don't really understand the world. These experiences lead to the person engaging in hyper-reflectivity, or abnormally prolonged and intense self-reflection, to attempt to gain a grasp on these experiences, but such intense reflection may further exacerbate the self-disorders.

Edit: I also relate to many of those basic symptoms."

But like, I know they’re real, but I think that they access my reality through my mind and I’m pretty sure meds would affect that. I took antipsychotics a couple years ago and it made them harder to notice. My worry is that, yeah it’s terrifying a lot of the time but I’m so so close to understanding SOMETHING vastly important and they’re telling me I have to follow through with it. Also they were mad last time I took meds. Don’t like that at all.

Of course, my psychs tried to tell me that I’d be able to understand “these thoughts” better if I went on meds but... I don’t know, I feel very clear-headed even when I get confused now. Maybe I’ll take them after I understand what’s happening better. I do appreciate what you mean though, and I’m trying to not be paranoid of my doctors.
