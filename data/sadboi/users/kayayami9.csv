Can you talk with your parents about your feelings? You're being really selfish and your negative thoughts doesn't help.


Give her a chance, a little chance, you can find a really good friend on her, even better, a sister, you might don't share the same blood, but you both can be really close to each other. If you're not interested at all, leave her alone and don't say bullshit to her.

Work in your emotions and reactions please, you're not the center of the world."
raisedbynarcissists,fp9wve3,t1_fp95rux,1588436229.0,"My mother never gave me the opportunity to choose my studies. I always wanted to study tourism, and I told her many times, I had already decided the university where I would study it, but she never listened. Since high school she decided that my future would be in the area of engineering and computing, always with the excuse of ""I want the best for you."" 


She also didn't let me choose my university. My self-esteem and insecurity gave way to anxiety and depression that made me go from one career to another. 


Currently I stopped studying. My family is a little disappointed on me, but I am getting ready for do what I really want to do with my life."

He's not a kid, he deserved to know what happened between you both, because you're his parents! Btw he isn't older enough to deal with it alone (I think nobody is) you should take your son to therapy, to deal with his emotions and thoughts, also to not broke the relationship with his mom. 

My parents got divorced (my dad cheated) when I was 13, I already knew all what happened, but I didn't received any psychological help, that's affected my relationship with them and mental health. So please take care of your son.

About nudity and underwear, I think they don't see us (young brother and I) as separate people. They don't say anything about it, it's a normal o casual thing for them. And just one time my stepfather got into my room when I was recently out of the shower, he tried to push away my bathrobe ""just for fun"". He saw a little of my body and I got angry, I took him out of my room. We didn't talk about it and he never tried to do it again.

Thank you for comment, you bring me out questions and different views about it. And yeah, things are better know, I'm protecting my young brother about things like this. Take care too!"
