There‚Äôs no reason to reach pirate legend. It‚Äôs all for cosmetics. You do the same thing everyday when you get on the game. There‚Äôs nothing to keep us coming back.

If you enjoy hunting , then do trader but you risk players stealing your goods if you go for higher risk deliveries. Bounty hunter is fun but has no real ‚Äúfun‚Äù in my opinion. In the end id say max all 3 (which is level 20) because you get so much gear and unlockables too.  Plus when a new thing is added to the game usually as long as those roles are fully leveled , you usually get the item that was just added. For example I received a lot of different masks for Halloween because I already completed the new achievements for the roles. Also make sure you buy the outlaw pass to make sure you get the most out of online loot."

retrogames,f56u1d4,t1_f56js3o,1572027686.0,"I believe The reason so many games now are large and open world is cause there‚Äôs less and less limitations now for creating a game. So many franchises have the ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù mechanics for gear and all of the other things because most players (not all) think it‚Äôs rewarding to put hours into something and come out of it majorly stronger and able to do more things. I‚Äôm curious how many AAA titles you‚Äôve tried in the past 3 years and what where your thoughts on them.

Please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying to prove you wrong or sound like a ass, I‚Äôm genuinely curious about your points you wanna make.

Most people are blinded by nostalgia and would instantly say they‚Äôd play 64 without realizing odyssey has way more things to do, collect, explore, etc....That‚Äôs what I mean when I say newer games have a lot more things to do. By the time you completed everything in 64 and got bored of it , your not even half-way done with odyssey. Also I‚Äôd like to add, you stated the newer games ‚Äúfeed us recycled content‚Äù but in reality old retro games do that all time. Just because it‚Äôs old or nostalgic doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs immune to having flaws. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Good Gameplay and story is usually what makes a good game good, However you have to understand that just because a game is ‚Äúold‚Äù or ‚Äúretro‚Äù or even ‚Äúnostalgic‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt make it to not be allowed to be judged upon and it doesn‚Äôt automatically make it better than newer games."

news,euk373o,t3_cgmg85,1563882611.0,My mom had 3 cats and my sister had 2. Every single one was a girl. They were declawed because they ruined our furniture and didn‚Äôt understand the scratch post. They were also spayed and neutered because we didn‚Äôt want them trying to get out of the house and mate. I understand a lot of people are against it but would you rather keep spending a shit ton of money replacing furniture after furniture because they don‚Äôt learn. Or fix the issue in a day.
news,euk2rf3,t1_eujbf87,1563882428.0,"I‚Äôm happy that it happened , I don‚Äôt want a turtle neck sweater on my cock"
blackdesertonline,eudyoro,t1_eudymec,1563730878.0,I repaired it and also deleted the cache and it‚Äôs working as of now.
depression,etm9lrb,t1_etm59hg,1562955046.0,I appreciate both of you voicing how you felt and also letting me understand this sub better. It‚Äôs seems you both possibly understand what I‚Äôm going through and if you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôd like to maybe recieve a chat from you and talk about it with you
depression,etm94gl,t1_etlpobc,1562954743.0,"So I was at work for the last 5 hours and I had a mental breakdown , it was bad. External is my family and how I‚Äôm treated by everyone around me or who I meet. Internal is I‚Äôm so so so alone and I wanna die and disapear , obviously id never act on this but I feel like I have no purpose to be here or be alive and I feel like finding someone I can love and be with would fix that because it has in the past healed me a bit. It‚Äôs is very very VERY HARD for me to think positive because I do not care about myself or anything anymore. Caring about something is a rare feeling I have now so it‚Äôs very hard to have positive thoughts. I appreciate the help but in the end , I feel as though finding someone is my best bet to happiness."
depression,etlo6tc,t1_etlip8q,1562941499.0,It‚Äôs external and internal and it never goes away and I‚Äôm having a breakdown at work right now
depression,etleu2w,t1_etleq26,1562934219.0,Yeah I agree but also I do believe out of common courtesy that each person on here should have someone to be able to relate and talk with. It‚Äôs makes you feel like complete crap being ignored and seeing everyone else not be so why not be the person who helps someone
depression,etlep63,t1_etlekc0,1562934095.0,"I mean if your actually going through similar stuff , why not send me a chat message? Maybe we can talk about how we cope and stuff like that. I‚Äôd like it"
depression,etleid1,t1_etleevc,1562933914.0,Your fine dude or .. dudette lol but I‚Äôm glad you let out your rant on someone who‚Äôs actually gonna read it
depression,etem62f,t1_etcop19,1562737509.0,"I understand your trying to help me understand and get better. But this doesn‚Äôt do anything for me. I don‚Äôt wanna come off as a asshole but what I‚Äôm about to say my sound like one. Don‚Äôt tell me I‚Äôm playing the victim when you know absoulutly nothing about me besides the barebones and you know nothing of how I‚Äôm treated or what I‚Äôve gone through. Also I do force myself to do things and it only makes it worse. I can‚Äôt keep pushing myself because I‚Äôve gone past my breaking point and I can‚Äôt keep going anymore. I‚Äôm not trying to ruin my health anymore. Working hard and changing my outlook has done nothing to me , in fact it‚Äôs made it worse. Video games are a amazing coping mechanism because I‚Äôm able to escape and finally just be myself in a fake world where what I love and want matter because I‚Äôm in charge. I refuse to socialize with others and in fact I‚Äôm done with putting up with people cause in the end everyone is the same to me. They don‚Äôt give a shit about me or how I feel or wanna help me or be with me or anything. It‚Äôs all out of pity that they feel like that and that‚Äôs not ok. My family is wrong. They know nothing about how I feel, Refuse to listen to how I feel and what will help, and so does everyone else that I talk to about my problems. I wrote this post because I have officially given up. Whenever I wanna meet someone , it ends up in ruins and I get hurt. Whenever I talk to someone about my issues , nothing goes my way , etc , etc.. so you know what? I‚Äôm done , I‚Äôm giving up and I‚Äôm going to continue to feel like this until someone finally can come along and be able to help me change it. I hate and despise my life and myself and I want to disapear."
