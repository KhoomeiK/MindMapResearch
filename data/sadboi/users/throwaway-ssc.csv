>Complications continue to be reported more commonly among those under age 15 at VMMC, especially in infants. In an analysis of Notifiable Adverse Events reported through the PEPFAR system, 100% of glans injuries and 90% of fistulas were reported in the 10-14 age range. The ratio of related NAEs to circumcisions performed is five times higher in EIMC (15.3 per 100,000) than in MC of young adolescents (10-14 years) (2.9/100,000), which in turn is about double the ratio in 15+ year-olds (1.6/100,000).  On further review of the data, 90% of glans injuries and 66% of fistulas occurred in those 12 years old or under at the time of VMMC. While measures to prevent the use of the forceps-guided technique in those with immature anatomy have reduced the rate of glans injuries, they continue to occur in young clients. **Based on NAE review, severity of glans injuries and fistulas when they occur, and expected timing of pubertal development, PEPFAR is changing the lower age for VMMC to 15 years or below 15 only those who have reached Tanner stage 3 of sexual development to minimize risks.** \[Emphasis theirs\]

In the documentary American Circumcision (on Netflix, check it out, it's comprehensive) there's a mom whose son was circumcised, suffered a gruesome injury to his penis, and the doctors claim it was always like that and that the injury was discovered during the circumcision. I guess I have a sort of cynical view of the medical profession, and it seemed plausible to me that this sort of thing was widespread, when I considered the incentives. That's all."

If the only difference between aborting a fetus and murdering a non-fetus was that not aborting the fetus is more inconvenient than not murdering the non-fetus, but the fetus and the non-fetus both had a lot of moral value, then... that would be one thing. But pro-choice people rarely argue thusly, and they'd probably be a lot less popular if they did.

Do you see what I'm saying here? The question of ""does a fetus have moral value"" is important, and it can't be reduced into The Worst Argument in the World."
