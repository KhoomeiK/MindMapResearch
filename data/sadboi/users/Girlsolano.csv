A. I honestly don't know if water helps! Try looking it up.
3. I guess that your hormone levels will vary depeding on whether or not you're sexually active. This may be causing the variation in the production of smegma.
4. I personally am a person who naturally produces a bit of smegma which I clean everyday with warm water and a clean washcloth. Once in a while I'll use an intimate soap with balanced ph (I'm a girl but my partner uses it too and he thinks it's quite gentle!). I then pat perfectly dry with a clean towel."

She is entitled to tell (or not tell) whoever she wants, press charges or not, etc. But the ONE thing she HAS to do is go to the hospital and get all the tests that need to be done and collect evidence in case she wants to press charges later. Here in Canada you have up to 5 days after the initial assault to get the physical evidence and you can refuse to get evidence collected even if you disclose the assault. WHETHER SHE WANTS TO GO TO THE POLICE OR NOT SHE MUST GO GET HERSELF CHECKED AT THE HOSPITAL and specifically say she was assaulted (the procedure is different that simply coming in and saying ""test me for stds""). Once again, here in Canada you can go to a health care facility, say youre a victim, get all the tests and evidence needed just in case and never be pressured into talking to the police.

sexualhealth,fo3q4d2,t3_g5j5hd,1587491112.0,"Ummm I've heard of performance anxiety induced ED, this might partially explain your issue as it seems like it mutated into that: ""I'm so scared I wont get erect so focusing on that stress makes me unable to get erect"". But as for the root cause of the ED when on missionary I'm quite puzzled, I know sometimes people's sex performace can be impaired by a repetitive routine that can make the usual sex life boring. Maybe your gf going on top goes out of that routine and seems more exciting than missionary hence the strong erections. You could try using some other positions for a while, maybe the appeal of missionary will come back after a pause. You could also look up variants of the missionary position, there are tons. Another thing you guys could try is doing it missionary in a different place (let's say you mostly have sex in the bedroom, well try the sofa for a change). As per your description of your issue, it seems like your ED isn't severe (you can still get erect) and that it is situational, so I don't think you need a doctor or anything yet, if I were you I'd try to talk to a sex therapist, sometimes there are some community services that have them available for small issues for free (stuff like planned parenthood for example).
If after making some modifications to your sex life or if it has been more than a couple months and it persists, then may be the time to get a doctors appointment, only they can diagnose a sexual dysfunction and then begin to rule out physical causes. If it doesn't come from an issue with your body they'll most likely send you to a therapist so you can work it out."

BUT this 72 day period starts and ends every second, this means that every second multiple sperms become mature and several begin maturation process. Usually, the refractory period (the time your body needs to be ready for intercourse again) is enough time for a male to create new sperm and ejaculate a normal quantity of sperm. It changes from person to person, but usually a healthy young male will be able to ejaculate a couple of times in a day without ""running out"" of sperm."

Be that person that wants the group to succeed and getting along with your teammates is an important part of it. Having that kind of attitude often results in making friends through those study groups AND people in your classes will remember you as that cool dude ya know? My last advice would be to articipate in sociocultural activities: plays, conferences, parties, debates, even if you only participate as a planner. I'm 100% sure that there are many people who do relate to you and would think of you as a great person and a great friend!

Even if I had a doctor's notice so my allowance wouldnt be cut if I was part-time, it wouldnt help since I wasted thousands of student loan dollars on semesters that were cancelled because I was incresdibly sick, so I only have 2 000$ left available. I still have 3 semesters to go, I have no idea what I'm going to do. I was hopeful when the PM announced the 2k monthly relief package for citizens, but since I didn't lose my job to covid (I didnt have one to begin with since I was studying and obviously part-time working is out of the question) I dont qualify to receive that money. I'll most likely not be able to find a job in the economic climate we're in (assuming the quarantine is over this summer) and I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do.

This is based on my personal experience and not on research or anything, but it works. You may need to practice a little in front of the mirror before nailing it. Put like that it sounds very sociopathic, I know... but I only use it in situations where it's absolutely necessary (a dramatic coworker who wouldnt stop distracting me and I have to push him away without causing a scene or an awkward situation in the workplace, for example). Tbh most part of the success of my interactions comes from honesty: ""im sorry but I need to get some work done"", ""i dont really feel like talking right now"", ""im not interested in your party but thanks for the invite"" (you have to be polite, nice and firm tho).

Imagine someone hurt you and broke your leg, with time it will most likely heal on its own without any professional help and you may be able to walk, but it will have healed wrong and it will surely hurt and you will limp and be handicapped by it for the rest of your life until you break it again and someone helps you heal it properly. It's basically the same thing you know? Right now, youre may be able to still go around with your day and function, but this experience might have scarred you in a way that could handicap you emotionally in your future relationships. I am not a psychologist and Im not in your situation, of course, but I have experienced abuse from a loved one that I didnt address for years, so I feel confident in talking from experience: it RARELY (maybe even never) goes away on it's own. You do what you feel is best for you, but maybe, just once, give a stranger the benefit of the doubt. Maybe a good place to start that wouldnt seem too overwhelming would be to read about it: read about people who lived abuse and their stories, scientific papers related to this issue, treatments available, biographies, etc. It wouldnt get you stuck in a treatment youre maybe not yet ready for while still being therapeutic in some way. I know that while I was waiting to get treatment for mental illnesses it helped me understand my situation better. I'll leave you a link of BetterHelp, it wont hurt to just take a look, see what you think. Also, my inbox is open if you need anything, it would be my pleasure to help you in any way, if I can.
Good luck to you friend, I know youre capable of doing this, I truly believe in you.

sexualhealth,fm3edjr,t1_fm3682v,1585720704.0,"Ill remind you quickly that some STIs (such as chlamydia) can be asymptomatic in many people and can even remain underlying for years causing devastating consequences on your reproductive health: infertility is a common result of unresolved chlamydia. I dont mean to make you paranoid by saying this, I just thought you should know so you can make a well informed decision. Glad I could help you out, if you feel like you need to address further concerns I recommend you give a call to your sexual health clinic or look up planned parenthood's website. They should have well trained professionals who can answer your more delicate and precise questions. Good luck!"
sexualhealth,fm32t48,t3_fsq4fo,1585711429.0,"I just deleted my comment, I realized I read your post wrong, let me start over.
5 days post treatment should be fine, that being said you have to be sure that your partner followed through with the treatment all the way, otherwise it wouldn't be effective and the infection would most likely persist. If this is a regular partner you know well, you might be able to trust them. If this is a one time thing or a partner you don't know that well, it may be wise to take a test, just to be sure (take that doubt off your mind, ya know). Useful advice: dental dams and finger condoms are a thing which makes ""risky"" or occasional sexual encounters safe and fun. Don't forget that any fluid exchange on a mucous body part (genitalia, anus, mouth, nose, eyes) can lead to viral or bacterial infection which, in the case of sexual contacts, could be very serious, even fatal. Take care of yourself and remember that using protection is not only safe for you, but for everyone involved, it's only smart!"

bipolar,fm1nrha,t1_fm1mb05,1585681764.0,"If you're willing to share your global location (such as the state you live in, if youre in the US, not like your city or town) Id be more than glad to look up a list of comunity services available to you. I understand we dont always have the strength to fight in such situations, if this is your case, Im more than willing to lend a hand."
bipolar,fm1nhvw,t1_fm1mb05,1585681623.0,"File a complaint with the agency's* regulatory entity. Even private agencies have governmental standards and rules to abide to. I suggest you look up community services in your area specialized in mental health or bipolar disorder and ask about your possibilities. I guarantee there is a way to help this situation, might take a bit of time and work, but I feel like it's worth it.
Edit: typo made it seem as if there was a thing called ""the agency regulatory entity"", what I actually meant was that there is surely an entity (government, corporation) that applies regulations on the agency you use, find out who it is they abide to and file a complaint."
bipolar,fm1f0kw,t3_fsh47o,1585677215.0,"How old are you? Who is your caregiver? There are resources to address this issue depending on where you live. You don't need to endure silent suffering, there is people out there working everyday so situations like yours don't carry on. Have you tried talking to your caregiver about their attitude?"

memes,fm19kt3,t3_fse9us,1585674453.0,"I'm sorry if this comes accross as racist, but I had always come to understand that the word ""nigga"", whether used by african american people to refer to their fellows or by other races as a racial slur, meant ""black person"". So I'm confused as to why this template says ""black nigga"". Is it because the word was used as a synonym of ""dude"" (such as: a dude who is black)? Or is it only for comical purposes?"
