- m16 grenadier barrel
 That's what I used to use for warzone a long time except the stock, I prefere to sacrifice this to get a 60 rounds ammo instead. 


If you want something faster for close combat situations, like small maps in hardcore for example :

But there was that french team (fun team, nothing near pro gaming), and I started to play on their server. Everybody was super nice, and when a new player joins the server, they all take care of him so he'll have fun and won't go mad even if doesn't hit a single shot. It was always good time playing with them, laughing a lot. Any troll was kicked or banned so the mood on the server is always set to fun.

Anyway, I spent few months playing and improving my skills, everything else in my life was.... boring. But really nothing to complain about. Until my dad had to go to the hospital. It was pretty bad. I didn't tell anyone on the server because I just didn't want pity from anyone. 

Just after that, I had my heart broken by the woman I loved. Short story long ; she had found someone better than me so she left me for him. I felt more lonely and sad than ever and started to have suicidal thoughts. I went to a psychiatrist and he advised that I should go rest in a psy unit for a month or two, where I could be safe from hurting myself. Again, I didn't tell anyone. But this time it was because I was not allowed to keep my phone the first week.

Two days after I got my phone back, the leader of the team called me and told me he'd like me to become a member of the team, as an admin. I was very sad so I told him the situation. He told me the choice was mine but he still wanted me in his team when I was able to get back home. It seems like nothing, right? But it made me feel proud of myself, and gave me something positive to focus on. A game, just a game. It was enough, because I played it with the rights guys.

Only the leader knew about my dad, he became my best friend and really helped me go better everyday by playing and having fun conversations on the phone. I never met him, btw, but he is my best friend, whatever people may say about that.

My dad died, sadly, after a year in hospital. Again, the leader of the team had my back. The game was here to let me breath a little when I needed to. 

Plot twist : CSGO since became a shitty game full of cheaters and I can't play it anymore because it makes me a angry gamer. 

But I still have my best friend even if I don't play this game anymore. I'm still a member of that awesome team and talk to them everyday on TeamSpeak."

But as a lot of things you need to conserve a long time, put it in the freezer. I don't know why yours made you cough and you did the right thing by throwing it away. Never mess with your health.
When it was still legal, I bought once 1L of 6 mg/ml in my local shop. It smelled awful and I didn't even try to vape it, so I returned it. Better be safe than sorry.

Here's the thing when you buy 100/200/250 mg/ml. Shake it good when it comes home so the nicotine is evenly distributed in the bottle. Then put  the bottle in your freezer, in a Tupperware (some people say the bottle could leak but I never had this problem, but again, beter be safe than sorry). Then when you need to get your liter of 6 mg/ml, you take 24ml of the 250 mg/ml with a syringe (with gloves and glasses, safety first, always) and inject the 24ml in your 1L neutral base. You will notice that the frozen nicotine has become thick because of the cold, it's totally normal. Just use a fat needle to make the process easier.

You can use an app to calculate the dosage you want, depending on the nicotine concentration you want. I use Vape Tool Pro cause it's easy. But any other app will do the trick, even a simple calculator will work if you know the formula."

I just hope one day you'll realize (not you personally, but every gun enthusiasts) that it's fun shooting in a range with safety rules, security, and that you don't need to have your gun at home and should avoid it as it's deadly dangerous.

No, no one wants to kill your family at home, so you don't need a gun to protect your family. And you don't need to shoot someone who would just want to steal your Xbox.
