Nothing will ever replace your dad, but grief is a very, very human condition and you are not the first person to struggle this way. I’m not a professional, but I’m wondering if the fact that you lost your father so young might play a part in why you’re having such a hard time now, even 6 years later. 

If you can, try googling “complicated grief” and seeing if any of the causes/symptoms resonate with you. And please, talk to someone about what you’re experiencing – a relative, guidance counselor, teacher, doctor, or any adult that you trust – and ask if they can help you. 

It might take some time, but there are ways for you to navigate this and find some sense of happiness – I certainly think you deserve it (and I’m sure your dad would agree).

quittingsmoking,eztfxq9,t1_ezrj5hv,1568129394.0,"Wow, what an unusual question... I never really asked myself that before! Thanks for doing it for me.

I don’t know if I’d call it brain fog, but I *definitely* feel like my mental health has improved significantly since I quit. 

I started smoking over a decade before I met my current partner, so he was very understanding.  But eventually he became really vocal about how concerned he was for my health, and the way that impacted me is what eventually made me want to quit. 

When he first started giving me shit, I’d just smoke as much as I possibly could earlier in the day so he wouldn’t smell it on me after work. But in order to feel like I’d had “enough,” I’d have to take long & continuous breaks throughout the day where I’d smoke myself into oblivion. I’d almost make myself sick. 

Trying to keep that from him was stressful. Spending so much time away from my work was stressful. Starting to actually think about what I was doing to myself was stressful. And to do allllll of that thinking with a dry mouth, a sore throat, an aching chest, the smell of smoke on my clothes & in my hair... eventually I just got fed up. What used to soothe me became uncomfortable & mentally scattering. 

I didn’t realize it at the time, but feeling/thinking about the impact of my smoking to that extent, every day, was exhausting. And it’s been wonderful not having to worry about all of those things anymore. 

Thanks again for asking. Have you quit or experienced something similar?"

Applying antibiotic cream might not be the best course of action, but keeping the area clean & considering the risk of infection certainly is. Maybe that’s something he didn’t consider. 

Seeing a waxer/aesthetician instead of a dermatologist, again, might not be ideal. But if the latter isn’t accessible for whatever reason, that might be OP’s best chance at addressing his immediate needs in a less risky way.

My dad used to do some body-guarding work and had a buddy who worked at Saturday Night Live. Long story short, he pulled a few strings and got me into their dress rehearsal. After they ran through their songs, I was invited down to the stage to meet them. 

They walked me straight up to the lead singer, Jonathan, and I started sobbing so hard I could barely speak. And let me tell you – he was gracious, kind, patient, and totally lovely throughout the entire blubbery exchange, and it’s part of why I still consider myself a big fan today.

Not trying to be a dick, but “it would behoove you to look at” what I actually said before assuming I’m naive to the way things actually are. I chose my wording for a reason. 

The way a person’s compensation/market value *ought* to be determined, is rarely the way it actually *is.* Therefore, I *feel* the job market can be a very harsh & shitty place for a candidate to find themselves, regardless of how qualified they are.

But IMHO, tough job markets encourage companies to turn into r/choosingbeggars. And when starting salaries for advanced degrees look like this, it’s hard to imagine these candidates aren’t being taken advantage of. 

$15/hour is $31k/year. 

Where I live, that’s what you’d expect to make as an entry-level admin with a Bachelor’s degree. Maybe even with a GED. You’d make almost that much as a Barista at Starbucks, and with none of the crippling student loan debt. 

If a position genuinely requires candidates with such a high level of skill & schooling, I feel the compensation being offered should more fairly & accurately reflect that."
