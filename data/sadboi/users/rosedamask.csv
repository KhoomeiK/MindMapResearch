I can understand what you are saying though. If one person has a higher sex drive, porn will avoid making sex a chore for the other.

However, when 2 partners have sex drives that are very similar to each other, that's where I cannot really see porn as a solution. Obviously this depends on the feelings of both partners, some people are fine with it but others aren't. The thought of ""he prefers to watch other women than do things with me"" can easily come into the mind of a woman who's partner watches a lot of porn.
