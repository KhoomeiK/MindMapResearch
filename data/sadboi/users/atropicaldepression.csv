Plan my meals and always have a snack for emergencies, sugar-free chocolate has been a lifesaver.

I try to keep ""smart snacking"", for example, these things have been my salvation Don't Worry Meringues

I try to eat as healthy as possible but also don't limit myself too much because I realized when I do that, my brain urges me to binge so bad, so I just adjust if I want to eat something junky with my calorie intake number and play with it, this has been the hardest because when I start it's really hard to stop but depriving myself of those foods only make it worse, I usually eat those things on Fridays only.

Exercise. I run and I joined a gym, at first I was not happy at all but when you start to see results, it boosts your motivation so much.

Sometimes I just have the urge to eat nonstop again but I feel that I have a little bit of control now and I don't want that to change. Before this I tried so many times, there were so many 1st days, now that I feel there's progress I'm willing to keep it going. Don't give up."

This is what I have been doing:

* I don't follow a diet but I count calories, I got my calorie intake calculated here: [https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html)  and I use the app ""lose it"" to track them, I consume 1400-1500 on weekdays, this is the amount I need to consume to lose weight and on the weekend I consume more but never more than 1900-2000 which is my limit to maintain weight.
* That said, I try to eat healthy, I eat eggs, chicken, almond milk, fruits, veggies on a daily basis. I drink a lot of water and I drink coke zero, it's not ideal but it personally helps me so much with sugar cravings.
* I go to the gym (3 times per week) and I run (3 times as well). I love cardio but I try to lift as well, but the best thing to weight loss is HIIT, you can find a lot of HIIT videos on YouTube, you keep burning calories after the thing, is amazing but haaard as hell, so keep it easy. if you're working out from home you can watch Fitness Blender channel on YouTube they have hundreds of videos with ideas. Exercise is great and it helps you in many ways but for weight loss keep in mind that the thing that matters the most is your calorie intake.

I hope this helps!"

then you're way too close to an eating disorder, you don't need to eat that little to loose weight, even if you don't feel bad now, eventually it will cause several damage to your body. Don't do that.

I don't feel motivated all the time but I make myself go to the gym, I don't want to be on a calorie deficit but I prepare myself food and bring it with me, when you see the results, you learn to enjoy it, trust me. But the key is not motivation, is action. Starting slow did wonders for me, I started working out twice a week, now I do 5 days and I feel so good after each workout.

depression,eri4ern,t3_c27426,1560889276.0,"Hello!

I totally understand your position, I've been there.

I was prescribed citalopram, I panicked and didn't want to take them but I did and let me tell you, **they saved my life.**

I took them for around a year and a half and then we (my doctor and I) decided it was ok to leave them, I was really scared about the side effects and being dependent but nothing bad happened, I followed the instructions to leave them until one day, I didn't have to take any. It has been 3 months now and I'm doing so well!! I'll forever be grateful.

&#x200B;

So don't be afraid, follow the instructions, ask every question you have, be disciplined, this is good for you! Later on, you'll look back and realize it was the best decision.

&#x200B;

Now, not everything is smooth, of course you can sometimes have side effects, they are not pretty but it's temporal, if you still have them after 3-4 weeks you can switch and that would be totally ok.
