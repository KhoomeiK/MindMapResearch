Needafriend,flghat4,t1_flf6t33,1585142549.0,I feel like such a loser! Like if I were more “together”as a person before this then I would still have plenty of friends to be having coffee FaceTime dates with or people to check up on and vise versa. Instead it’s me. All day. Until my very patient boyfriend gets home and then I drive us both crazy 🙃 I have no one else currently getting all of my attention and he’s gonna lose it lol. I really appreciate the suggestions and those are all good ideas for when this is over. I want to go volunteer somewhere but idk if that’s even optional either for now. Maybe i’ll teach myself how to knit in the meantime. Targets still open
relationship_advice,f8h0ypg,t3_e0khbs,1574567976.0,"You are VALUABLE and I applaud you for making it to 18 and staying a virgin this far. He may be sweet to you now but if a guy responds in that kind of way because he doesn’t get what he wants from you, he doesn’t deserve you. He apologized this time but from what I’ve seen guys like that don’t change. He’ll he re-think his strategy on how he can get you to hook up with him, his eye is on the prize. He probably will keep pushing you, until you cave. Or try to convince you that you should because he cares about so much and won’t ever hurt you blah blah shit.NEVER r do anything with your body that YOU aren’t ready for. I lost my virginity when I was 15 cause I was raped. after that I had sex for a lot of years because my self worth was 0. Regardless of how my cherry got popped, I wish someone had talked to me and told me that I was still worth something and didn’t HAVE to give pieces of myself away like that for so long.  I wish I had saved more of myself for the man who is the love of my life now, and who respects me and has never pushed me or thought low of me because of my past, I’m 25 now and he’s never tried to take advantage of my past either.  Your guy probably won’t change. Unfortunately it takes guys way longer than us girls to grow up and mature in thinking. He’s 18 and probably considers himself a “man” now and he is entitled to sex with the girl he’s chosen, regardless of what that girl may feel. If you don’t give him sex and stay together, he probably will dump you to get it somewhere else. Save yourself a heart break and possible regret. If he REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU HE WILL ALWAYS RESPECT YOU ESPECIALLY WITH SEX AND YOUR BODY. Good luck shug"
depression,f8bwqyc,t3_e00pxq,1574447101.0,Same. Sometimes I use that I’m sick or i’ve been sick instead to make up for really down times during my depression. It gets in the way of things sometimes I can’t stomach leaving my house or holding conversations with friends/being social. Missed work days once in a while. It’s difficult.  I hate explaining myself or trying to explain the depression and how it effects me. I feel like a whiny bitch which is NOT true or healthy thinking because i’m definitely not in actuality a whiny bitch at all. Stay strong and know you aren’t alone
depression,f87532o,t3_dzeq21,1574316348.0,Thank you all for taking the time to write and respond. It’s good to be reminded i’m not alone in this like my head likes to tell me I am. It means a lot to me so thank you really

Advice,f83nhns,t3_dytsu6,1574216068.0,"Relationship too quickly is what I meant. There is no right or wrong way to get over or move on from a relationship. In my experience trying to fill a void and avoiding the loss and emotions from a break up didn’t help, I think it’s about what your intentions for yourself are"
Advice,f83n1xm,t3_dym5qc,1574215748.0,I’m in the exact same way as you are when it comes to relationships. I prioritize my significant other to a fault because eventually I am let down or what seems to be left behind (Aka we break up) . It ends and I feel like i’m starting over again and there’s nothing to look forward to because the other person made the best part of everything in my life. I don’t know how to change that yet. I’m 25 and haven’t ever hopped relationship to relationship. It’s that when i’m in one I’m REALLY in it. The time in between are usually a few years of being single again and it’s hard becoming okay with myself when it’s just myself. I know this is all scattered and hopefully you can relate in some sense of what i’m trying to say. I feel your struggle though and if you come to any conclusions let me know lol

Advice,f83m5pr,t3_dytsu6,1574215132.0,"5 years is a long time with one person, and at those ages you really did grow up together. Breaks ups are hard. No matter the situation. Life’s gonna be weird for a while and someone who was a staple for so long is now removed from your day to day life. Be patient with yourself. Some days you may really feel better and enjoy the single life. Others may have a lot of sadness because what you and her had is over. I would say sure meet new people but don’t rebound too quickly. It’s easy to do that without even realizing you’re doing it. Get to know yourself. As a single 24 year old man. You could find out a lot about yourself. Best of luck to you to matter what"
Drugs,f81tpjz,t3_dyi3e3,1574177125.0,I’ve been where you are and I feel all of the heaviness and what feels like going crazy for you man. I don’t know you but i’m sending you all love  and good vibes and strength. That inner voice copped with the physical aspect is a hell you don’t really understand to the realist unless you’ve lived it. I’ve been clean for a little while now and it has gotten easier to keep relapse nothing more than a thought instead of an action like I used to. Some would say chronic relapser 🤷🏻‍♀️ You can do this and your whole life will change. Know that no matter what be gentle with yourself and know that you have a friend rooting for you even if we’ve never met. Feel free to message me on chat anytime if you ever want or need someone
u_northsideLB,f7znp15,t3_dxw7ui,1574113392.0,"Idk if he actually cares to hear all of it. And I know it’s hard because i’m a stranger and no you don’t know our relationship. He’s my very best friend and we’ve been in each other’s lives over two years. I always have told him pretty much everything, he’s always been a stable thing in my life but now it’s like he has all of these ideas about what I’ll do or am doing because yeah even a year ago I would be off the deep end by now... idk. I don’t have a lot of friends back here in my home town anymore and it’s probably for the better in most ways but I appreciate people’s care in what i’ve said"
u_northsideLB,f7zn0ot,t3_dxw7ui,1574113107.0,It’s a shit show. The systems whacked and corrupt in his case especially. I feel like i’m running trying to do good for myself and keep it all together while being back in my hometown ( no good there) and dealing day to day life all without him and I don’t want to make anything worse.  Today we talked and I can tell he’s thinking about all the bad shit that happens to relationships when one of them is locked up.. cheating and all that shit.... He was paranoid today about what I’m doing and I really don’t know how to convince him that I really am being loyal. I’m with him in this and in his mind I’ve already fucked up wether that’s sleeping with someone else or relapsing. On one side I can’t blame him but on the other he really has no clue how I really am doing everything in my power to not fuck up. Idk I feel kinda stupid for posting about any of this but my heads spinning
u_northsideLB,f7zlxmn,t1_f7x6dnt,1574112647.0,I have never been very good at that but this last year especially I’ve really been trying to not go back to what I used to do or be and right now i feel like I’m holding on by my teeth. I feel whiny just for posting this lol
u_northsideLB,f7zlnp7,t1_f7x80xx,1574112533.0,Thank you. I feel like I can’t win no matter what right now
