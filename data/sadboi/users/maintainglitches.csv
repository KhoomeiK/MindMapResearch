BeardTalk,faclfqp,t3_e8j928,1575941851.0,"If your sides are way shorter than your chin on a natural basis, it means a triangular beard. Which can be very cool looking if you decide to fully embrace it, or the sides can be grown out to a length and then the chin trimmed to round it off. 

My general advice is to grow it out a little past where you want it to be and then trim it out. If it develops split ends trim those off."

FTMMen,fabj6r8,t1_fabh2wg,1575924035.0,"Ok yeah this is a really good example of different times, different concerns. I am 30 and started medically transitioning at 20. 

Puberty blockers were unheard of, every trans masc child was assumed to be a tomboy going through a phase, and the vast majority of adult trans people were assumed to be mentally ill people who shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to transition. 

Watch the movie But I‚Äôm A Cheerleader - that movie itself predates my ‚Äútranshood‚Äù a little bit but the way they treat the character Jan is a really good example of how nobody, including trans people themselves, even knew that trans masc existed. 

So, the younger people have a new fight to carry the movement in a new direction. I‚Äôm very glad for that, and I would advise any teenagers reading this  who are interested in activism to join already established activist organizations because it can be a lot to carry alone at a young age. (Speaking from personal experience.) If you are around generations of Queers it‚Äôs easier to rally at the state capitol and network that way. Just be aware of any creepy adults (or heck other teens who are creepy) and avoid."
FTMMen,fab9c8a,t1_fab8m5m,1575919733.0,"Speaking of different concerns, though, I can see how the ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need dysphoria‚Äù will eventually benefit prepubescent trans boys - right now the current approach is something along the lines of ‚Äúlet him grow tits and start bleeding and see if he‚Äôs dysphoric. THEN you can start considering allowing him to transition but most likely he will have to suffer a few more years just to wait and see.‚Äù 

But if people acknowledge that the trans boy doesn‚Äôt need breasts to be dysphoric about, and that it‚Äôs enough that he spends 24/7 thinking about wanting to be a boy (which is a form of dysphoria but a less recognized one imo) then I think that that is enough to start him on blockers ASAP, possibly T if feasible. 

One day hopefully dysphoria won‚Äôt be a defining feature of the trans experience if people get medical intervention early enough they won‚Äôt experience the wrong first puberty in the first place. Imo it‚Äôs easier to manage dysphoria only over genitals if everything else doesn‚Äôt even become a factor in the first place."

I wonder if this is a generational thing because it used to be a given cis people would always react with disgust. For example in the movie Crying Game, the guy VOMITS when he finds out she has a penis. So what I‚Äôm hearing might be that people aren‚Äôt disgusted anymore which is great. 

Oh I‚Äôm not bisexual either lol. In the instance of sexuality I think it‚Äôs more about the combination of attraction to gender and attraction to physical characteristics. It‚Äôs fine for people to have genital preferences and it‚Äôs fine for me to think that that preference is fucked up, it just means we definitely won‚Äôt be sexual together üòõ"

I just get angry when people rush to soothe a cis person when their first reaction is disgust. 

And yes I think it‚Äôs wrong to think genital preferences are NOT transphobic. That‚Äôs fine, other people can be transphobic and I would rather not sleep with someone who has ‚Äúgenital preferences‚Äù just like I would rather not sleep with someone who is a 100% straight woman or who is a racist.

asktransgender,f9zjk9v,t1_f9zhqz3,1575742446.0,"Did you read the rest of my comment about trans men who love men including cis men - My point is you can‚Äôt draw a line between cis and trans just because you‚Äôre imagining them having a history which they might or might not have just because of the genitals they have  

I mean hell even cis het men can have issues, it‚Äôs not like they lived a perfect life just cos they were born cis (which I think is a trap a lot of trans people fall into) - for example they may be AFRAID of women (not necessarily misogynist) because they were raped by a woman at a very young age and so they still subconsciously think that women are able to overpower them etc. 

All in all I think that queer identified people just don‚Äôt listen to cis men, or men who pass enough as cis that they can have more access to the kinds of conversations that cis men have in private, and just rely on stereotypes of what it means to be a man."
asktransgender,f9zh5kl,t1_f9wtixv,1575741816.0,"I disagree with this - if you hang around in the (mostly cis) gay male community you‚Äôll meet plenty of gay dudes who are afraid of cis straight dudes in a similar way. (Or even masc gay guys)

For example some dudes went through insanely brutal bullying for being a little bit soft (we‚Äôre talking about being ganged up on and stuffed into a locker and things like that - I‚Äôve even heard stories of people getting knives pulled on them). For some people the bullying is so bad that they stopped going to school. 

To be honest, a lot of gay cis guys like this tend to only hang out with other gay guys (who are cis or read as cis) because they don‚Äôt trust other communities. So I can see how someone from a queer background might not have met guys like this before. 

Whereas some trans guys have nothing but positive experiences with cis dudes. And some trans guys always know they‚Äôre a straight dude so they don‚Äôt even have experiences with being in the lesbian and or queer community, they‚Äôre just straight men who love being men. 

Or heck, gay trans guys can love being men and also love men, which gives them even less interest in having anything to do with a ‚Äúqueer‚Äù identity that tries to tell them they are different than any other man."
