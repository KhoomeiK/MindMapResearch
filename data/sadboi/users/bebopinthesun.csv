CPTSD,fg1xo85,t3_ew9gaj,1580434774.0,I hate people who say this. They will never understand and now I exclude these people from my life.
CPTSD,fg1xkco,t3_ew85yu,1580434724.0,"I also went through this in the beginning! In fact I didn't even realize all the other events that added up in my own trauma history. I didn't even acknowledge being raped until earlier this year (because like many women and bystanders, I blamed myself). It's society and your brain telling you that you aren't enough."
CPTSD,fg1xc91,t3_ewcxrt,1580434620.0,You are a hero. I wish I could share this with everyone.
ptsd,ffxr4sd,t3_evn0ta,1580330775.0,"It has been five or six years since my experiences of being assaulted, stalked, abused. 

I went through this phase too. I refused to wear pink. Most of my wardrobe is black and grey. 

I am now finally starting to experiment with color and wear makeup more regularly again, and I am not as frightened anymore (though this week is off because of the Kobe business and I feel like I'm back to square one). 

Keep doing what you need to do to protect your energy. Forget the haters. Just be you. I wore hats and sunglasses. I never wanted to be seen. I didn't want him or his friends to find me or know where I was, since I lived in a small town. 

I still hate being in the spotlight (but the old me used to love theatre and karaoke and so this confuses people). Alas, ir doesn't matter. This changes us. We will never be the same but we can work toward discovering a new normal for ourselves."
ptsd,ffxp754,t3_eupi6t,1580329682.0,"I haven't forgotten, but I did until about two weeks before he died. 

I took a class on sexual and gendered violence, where the lawyer consulting with the prosecution of that case told everyone why he got away with it. It really pisses me off that news sources never tell the full truth from the victim's perspective. 

The victim was sent death threats, and had to relocate multiple times because someone posted her address publicly (sound familiar? Go check out Felicia Sonmez). She did not just ""refuse to testify"" at the last minute like every single news article says. She was FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE because people were threatening to kill her. 

I posted on social media about this exact statement in this thread. In the span of two days I was cussed out and deleted or blocked by people. I was also told, essentially, to get over it, and how disappointed people were that I would post that. ""have some empathy,"" they said. ""Sweetie, you need to move on,"" they said. ""I have PTSD too and I am a sexual assault survivor but you need to move on.""

Fuck. You. Fuck all of you that would say that to me. 

I have been in a completely activated state since Sunday when I saw literally everyone grieving this person that they never even knew personally, and watching them dismiss me and the millions of others who have been assaulted. 

I spent all of Monday crying my eyes out in a state of panic and I even threw up on the way to driving my toddler to preschool. 

Don't ever tell us how we should respond or a timeline on our healing. I legitimately thought I was healed. I was doing better. Then this happened, and all of the pain and paralysis returned. I was doing so well. 

Then Felicia Somnez got suspended from the Washington Post and received 10,000 tweets, many death threats, and also had her address publicly posted. She has already had to evacuate her home. She has been shamed and blamed and called awful names. 

I don't feel safe. I've taken a break from Facebook and thank God a friend sent me here. 

It seems like the world will never change. As a woman I feel like my experience will never be enough. If a victims evidence isn't enough and points straight to the perp, how will we ever get justice? How will anything ever change?

Feeling hopeless, helpless, paralyzed, and like giving up."
