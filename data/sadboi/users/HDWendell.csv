AskReddit,fqpbrn8,t1_fqp1phe,1589541901.0,"Prior to Jenner, it was seen that working in close proximity to cows with cow poxs often met a far more mild case of small pox. Milkmaids and mounted military personnel were some of these cases. 

Before Jenner made vaccines, people would purposely rub a cow's cow pox sores to give themselves cow pox to have a milder case of small pox. Small pox and cow pox are fairly similar so the body ""recognizes"" the pox invader sooner and builds an.immunity to it. 
Jenner studied this immunity and created the first vaccine (vacca as someone else pointed out below is a root word for cow).  

Fun fact, when I got my small pox vaccine (2006), it wasn't much different than old inoculation techniques. They used a sickle like device covered in a live virus and pressed it into my arm many times. A little better than an incision and pus. I wore plastic wrap on my arm for a week. The scab I developed was also a biohazard and had to be carefully disposed of. I still have a nickel sized scar."

stedwards,fqiols9,t1_fqihk3v,1589398783.0,"I graduated ACC with an AS in engineering and an AA in general education. For the transfer portion, my advisor really did almost all the work. I applied, they gave me like an offer of what was accepted and then my Natural Sciences advisor looked more in depth at my deficiencies and my credits. He did an override on some things. So the bigger limiting factor for me was the amount of transfer credits total I could get and some of the ACC equivalencies. I had a TON of credits and some of the ""fat"" was trimmed out so I could keep the credits for the harder classes. ACC also let me take an additional lit class instead of a language credit to graduate. This was a no-go. I should have taken a language 2 at ACC. Also, there are only certain languages accepted at SEU. ASL is not one but, if that is you, your advisor may be able to force it. The biggest thing for me was biology since I was going into a biology heavy field. My ACC course wasn't automatically accepted but my advisor took it. UT and did not take as many credits.

Austin,fq84y52,t1_fq6n3sx,1589158589.0,"Some people will inevitably get the virus and, no matter the resources, will not recover and die. That is beyond anyone's control. What is within our control is reducing spread so that it happens slowly enough to keep medical personnel on normal schedules, keep essential PPE stocked, and those who are infected get the resources they need. That's what flattening the curve is all about. The problem with this virus is that it takes so long to see symptoms if you even see symptoms. If have no reduction or little reduction in spread, that makes for a LOT of infected people really quickly. That means the resources are used very rapidly without time to restock. When there is no PPE, medical personnel must either put themselves at very high risk or turn away patients. That leads to unnecessary deaths. No ventilators means there are deaths that could have been avoided. No ICU beds means the other parts of the hospital must accommodate, putting other patients at risk and spreading the virus to the most susceptible. Healthcare workers on the front lines become exhausted, make mistakes, and become seriously infected themselves.

At the very least, slowing down the spread means more time for scientists to work. We might not have a vaccine for quite some time but we could have faster produced PPE so we can have more effective masks for everyone and can resume some activities intelligently. We can develop and test (we are already in this process) medications that reduce the infection recovery time and taxing nature. All of which keeps the curve flatter. 

So, 1000 deaths can very quickly and easily become 10,000 or 100,000. That is what the governor is getting blamed for."

Also, the population was majorly impacted since it was a pretty strained demographic already. Medicine was nowhere near as advanced as today or even as it was in WWII. 

As far as mutation is concerned, flu mutates pretty regularly. We can get vaccines for the flu by anticipating the mutations seen in different hemispheres ""flu season."" That being said, this NOT a flu virus. There is a lot not currently known about this virus. 

TLDR: it will likely mutate but, seeing the scale of Spanish Flu is less likely since we won't have similar structure of that time period."
