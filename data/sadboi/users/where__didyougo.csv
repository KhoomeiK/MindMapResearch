If that's not too expensive, look into getting urinary tract food. (ProPlan is the best brand for wet food - and I know there are dry urinary foods too.) There's also UTI creams you can put on their paws. If your cat's symptoms don't go away in a day or so after starting these treatments, it could be dangerous. These options I suggested are generally more preventive than they are treatment. I'd start with the wet food and paw gel.

Every cat is different, and my advice is probably going to bring some confusion with it, but hear me out. 

Don't take your cat on walks. Weird, right? You'd think that it would help - but it'll make the problem worse. It'll cause him or her to want to go outside more and more. So nip it in the bud, and do whatever you can to make your home a happy place. Make sure you have toys, both basic and interactive. Get him a friend if possible. Leave window blinds up so he can look out. Get a bird feeder and hang it up if you can. Hide treats around the house. Get ball feeders. As time goes on, he will stop trying to go outside if you cut him off from walks cold turkey. It's easier to live without something once you get used to it. Make sure he's fixed too, if at all possible. 

And thank you for keeping your cat inside! Outdoor cats have shorter life spans and are a problem."
