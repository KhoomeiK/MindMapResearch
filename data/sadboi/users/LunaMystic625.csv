breastfeeding,errydr9,t1_erry2vy,1561189480.0,"I've tried laying her down and just holding her. Neither seem to stop her from crying after being burped. I will definantly try to,contiune breastfeeding. I really dont want to stop. I thought it was cluster feeding at first but then I just couldnt get her satisfied it seemed no matter what I tried and thats when I begin to worry so much. We went home today from the hospital so i have an appointment on wednesday this up coming week. I really hope she stays in the correct seight range. Ive weighed her since being home ( I have a changing pad thats a scale) and she has seemed to habe gained a few ounces since she was weighed last night at the hospital ."
breastfeeding,eqrshx9,t3_bza34u,1560268803.0,"I'm a FTM due in a week. Is this really how little babies eat at first?! I honestly assumed it was at least a 4ounce bottle full! Wow do I have a lot to learn. Im so unprepared! 

Also I'm so happy you posted this so i could learn this! I want my husband to be able to do the same thing. Now I'm excited to know how to!  

Clarification is case i come off wrong: im not saying you dont produce alot by any means. I dont know what a lot vs. A little is. Just saying i didnt know they eat so little during feedings that it fits in a syringe! Lol"
