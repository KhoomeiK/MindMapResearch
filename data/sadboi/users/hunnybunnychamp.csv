Along the way, she lost herself. She always knew it’s a tough world and what happened to Mr Park traumatized her, made her realize that sticking to your principles can pummel you down. She became afraid and servile. Safe.

KDRAMA,fjwyn3n,t1_fjwhiga,1583649450.0,"I think SA represents many people in Korea who believe that working for a conglomerate is the safest bet for their future.

Soo Ah represents the countless young people - not just in Korea - who choose the traditional route of corporate grind and university degrees instead of going after their dreams, only to find out later on that their dreams have slipped away. They’re held hostage by a system that promised them stability but can easily chew them out when shit hits the fan. 

IC is a groundbreaking drama. It empowers people at the margins, who find it difficult to go against the powerful structures that keep them down.

Edit: of course this drama is inspiring but anyone who’s been out of university for a long time, especially those with families, know that very few people have a heart of steel or blessed with a dream team like PSRY.

KDRAMA,fjq2e7r,t3_fe9qbw,1583566158.0,"I think SRY had no concrete feelings for her up until the end of ep 11. But she is the person he trusts the most and that says a lot. He was clueless about his feelings and, even if he were mildly aware, inwardly he probably just kept shrugging it off as sibling / partner relationship, keeping in mind professionalism and age gap.

Besides, he is way too involved in his revenge that he sacrificed his “freedom“ and personal life, pushed that “sweetness” all the way later because he is emotionally too unavailable to fall in love. (Of course love doesn’t work that way even in real life, I know this well). Hes probably just a depressive person during much of his young adult life and his single-minded goal of beating Jangga Co. and becoming successful was what fueled him to live on 

I also think that Geun-Soo’s well-timed questions during Truth-or-Dare might have influenced Saeroi’s answers. Plus he’s not the type to reveal private feelings so openly even to his closest friends. 

Saeroi might also feel like he doesn’t deserve Yi-Seo, the same way he felt he could only deserve Soo-Ah only once hes made it. Yi-Seo is a smart girl and young, so she should have time to explore her youth and love life - I don’t think Saeroi wants to limit her and it shows he cares a lot for her, even if it’s not yet romantic. 

Saeroi can relate to Geun-Soo’s feelings for Yi-Seo and doesn’t want to hurt a person he considers a good friend or come between them. Saeroi cares a lot about his people and he wants them to be happy, that’s all that matters to him.

That’s why Saeroi told Yi-Seo: “you promised to go out with Geun-Soo if he takes over Jangga. That’s how it’s supposed to be...”

At this point though and with the revelation that YiSeo has feelings for him, I think Saeroi did feel conflicted and for the first time realized that he perhaps had some un-acknowledged feelings for Yi-Seo. 

But since everything is now out in the open and they need to maintain a professional relationship, he decided to let her down for her own good...

I know the majority here love IC’s revenge plot but a Kdrama isn’t complete without love triangles and love squares, and though it’s not the focal point of the drama yet I’m excited to see what happens next. IC is now getting franchised and success keeps coming - that’s a great achievement for Saeroi, so I welcome this shift to romance. :)"

Of course they’re a blend but they won’t look like either parent. Some genes are also stronger. Take a mixed white and black person. The black genes are stronger. Maybe the child could have lighter skin / hair / eyes but black genes are generally dominant. Although some may end up more or less white passing like Megan Markle or Mariah Carey, for example. 

Looking different is even more pronounced with mixed Asian children. The Asian eyes stay somewhat consistent even with racial mixing (and we know how much other races single this physical trait out to justify what makes Asians different from them) And actually, being mixed race people complicate your argument because they do not belong to a single race:

Let’s say a half-black/half-Asian person felt discriminated his whole life in his black community. He decides to only marry and procreate with a black woman and rejects all other races because he wants his kids to have zero problems being accepted into his black community.

Don’t cherry-pick my arguments. 

Getting hired and dating are not similar. When you hire someone, you’re supposed to hire based on credentials. Ideally, your looks and your cultural background shouldn’t influence the hiring decision. Being professional and qualified matter the most. But we know in reality that hiring is about likeability and people can’t get rid of their unconscious bias. 

Diversity in the workplace doesn’t just refer to ensuring inclusiveness and multicultural teams. In fact, even people from the same race have problems getting along and seeing eye to eye. Working with others mean coexisting with people who may have different viewpoints and ways of working. Tolerance and interpersonal skills are so important in the workplace.

Dating is different because it occurs on a personal level. It just gets deeply personal and no one really wants to simply tolerate their partners. You have your non-negotiables and that should be based on personality rather than race. Don’t view dating from a racialized lens, but also accept the fact that some people have preference in terms of looks (the media certainly influenced most people and they’re limited from thinking critically about how their preferences influence their sexual partners). 

My point here is people are just limited by their socialization and you can’t blame it on them. Not everyone have the time or energy to ideologically engage with how they were socialized. Is it their moral obligation to do so? Most people are just average middle class folks. Wouldn’t you say it’s the powers-that-be who have the moral obligation instead?

Moreover, if two people coming from similar cultures can already disagree so much and divorce, the odds for intercultural dating are even lower because there’s just less overlaps in culture and mentality. In my opinion then, dating someone of a different culture AND actually getting along is a triumph against the odds. Love conquers all and it’s beautiful.

But I argue too that that doesn’t mean someone who chooses to date someone similar to him in terms culture means that person is automatically racist. You’re choosing a partner for life and if your childhood neighbor fits the bill and shes been your dream girl since forever because you’d like to replicate the suburban white life that shaped you both, then you’ll just automatically reject anyone else who doesn’t fit that. 

But that same person could still enjoy traveling and exploring other cultures, admiring Indian or Ethiopian cuisine, and defend against racism.

Edit: phrasings and additional points"
changemyview,fj6e07p,t1_fj6dkgy,1583068775.0,"I still don’t think it’s immoral to reject someone based on race. Love and dating are not like not getting hired or getting profiled by the police because of your race. 

If someone grew up within a specific culture, they are socialized / predisposed to dating someone who has the same values, culture, and mentality. For these people, they would prefer to date exclusively within their race and culture - simply because their culture formed their mentalities and that’s their right to procreate with someone who looks like them and have babies who look like them. 

People can do exactly this AND STILL not hold racist views. People can date someone from a different culture - even marry them, procreate with them - and be some of the most racist people on earth."
changemyview,fj6deyf,t1_fj6bk9q,1583068148.0,"It’s their right to choose who they date. It doesn’t automatically mean they’re racist. We have to accept that people and their personalities are limited by their mentalities, which have been shaped by their culture and social upbringing. 

So someone who grew up in the West being incredibly independent might have trouble dating someone who grew up in a more collectivist culture, say, someone from Japan. They might just realize they’re not compatible as dating partners and one of them may come to the conclusion that he/she wants a certain attribute to be present in a partner and choose to date someone similar to him/her, who statistically speaking would be from his culture (proximity-wise, a white person is more likely to have white friends).

Where I would draw the line in terms of morality is people assuming anyone black is prone to criminality or any Latino man would be a good lover or that anyone Asian (even if they grew up in Asia) is inherently quiet and submissive. Doing this means you are imposing your limiting views about a group of people on these people without giving them the chance to show them who they are.

It isn’t immoral for example, if a white person prefers not to date a black criminal even if that white person acknowledges that a Black person has been hindered socioeconomically by institutionalized racism.

But it is immoral if that white person just flat out rejects all black people because they assume they all have criminal tendencies. This others any black person and limits them to a stereotype."

I never quoted anyone. I never said people said anything; I said people have historically been called “race traitors” when they date outside of their race, culture, or religion. I’m stating a fact that intercultural dating has always been frowned upon in most cultures and ethnicities. 

It’s more logical / conservative for people to NATURALLY prefer dating people of their own race and culture, and in my opinion (this is mine) it’s somewhat UNNATURAL for people to date outside of their culture or race. But there are other factors such as looks, perceived “sexiness”, and income that determine the dating patterns of people. That’s my point."

That’s not my opinion. I’m stating what seems to be received knowledge if you acknowledge the reality of social politics and the world around you. 

Let’s not feign ignorance here. I don’t know which part of the world you are from but have a look at the models and any other valid criteria for beauty (check out magazines and movie stars/Hollywood). They are overwhelmingly populated by white women. Even in other parts of the world, Eurocentric beauty ideals (having light skin, for example) are predominant."
changemyview,fj69f66,t3_fbsu95,1583063299.0,"I’ve generally given up on changing the views of racist people. They’ve set their minds to it and in the last centuries they (especially Westerners) have used science (Social Darwinism) to justify and validate their views. 

That said, I also don’t believe it’s immoral not to date someone because of their race and I wonder who gave you the idea that it is. It’s actually weirder for someone to want to date outside their race and these people have often been called “race traitors”. 

Dating - and marriage - has always had a socio-economic foundation. Class dictates dating more than race does, in my opinion. Studies have also shown this to be true. That’s why a black / Asian man needs to make a certain amount of income to be able to date a white woman (studies have shown this). And of course it is assumed socially that white women are top of the totem pole when it comes to dating, although yes there are sizable fetishist dating markets for Latina/Asian women. 

Women almost always choose their life partner based on income, but sex is also a common motivator for empowered females. Stereotypes of Latin men as great lovers have always attracted richer classes of women (by race, that means white and Asian women). You’ll see many Latina / Black women going exclusively for non-Latino / non-Black men once they’re fed up of dating them and especially if these women want to climb the social ladder."

Based on Maslow‘s hierarchy of needs, financial/material stability is basic for everyone.

Putting more structure and control over your life (better scheduling) also makes you feel more accomplished and helps boost your mood. 

Lastly, find a better job in the UAE. Something you’d like and would give you fulfillment, as well as other opportunities to work elsewhere.

Edit: just want to qualify what I said with this: ive also seen friends who went after their dreams and regretted it, mainly because it caused financial ruin or personal problems (divorce or disappointing their parents/family). You’ve got to strike the right balance between chasing your dreams and being practical."
AskReddit,fir5s4s,t3_f9fap5,1582657932.0,"Just make a choice (after careful deliberation), and then stick to it. Don’t regret your decision. Just accept you made that choice.

Like today, I was waiting for the bus and it was way too late. I decided to just walk my way home even if it would take me 10-15 minutes in the cold. I was indecisive because the bus could come any minute. 

So when I started walking away, I made a firm decision that I’ll accept it even if the bus comes while I’m walking. Fortunately, I made the right decision because the buses were cancelled. 

But even if they weren’t, I made the choice and accepted whatever happened after that choices"

KDRAMA,fijfy5w,t1_fi6ddrq,1582446162.0,"Hyun Bin and SYJ come from a generation of actors where sex is super taboo. Their images are goodie-goodie, especially in dramas. This is also tied up to their endorsements, perhaps they’ve signed deals that explicitly forbid any “immoral” tarnishing of their image. S Korea and Asian countries are still very conservative; besides, actors have more leeway in movies than dramas.

Some male actors also have older ahjummas / women as their target market, and keeping dramas sexless retains the mystery of these actors (women want to keep watching precisely because they’re hoping for the fan service that never quite comes - pun not intended) and this ensures that the actors keep securing high demand roles and endorsements. 

PSJ and younger generations are a lot more daring in terms of kissing and (implied) sex scenes perhaps because they’re not so confined by this as viewer tastes are changing (millennials) and so actors are freer to be a bit more experimental."
