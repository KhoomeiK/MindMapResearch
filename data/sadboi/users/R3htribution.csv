I hear you. Been there so totally understand. I'll writing this from the ER, after an allergic reaction to medication, but really wanted to reply.

The first thing to know is this: You're not alone! There are more people out there who understand than you can imagine.

As for managing right now, I'm going to make a couple suggestions. They're aimed at simplification, helping not become overwhelmed, etc. I hope they for the context of your situation.

1. Don't drink. It may feel like it helps now, but you'll feel worse later. Decide that after exams, you'll reward yourself with a bloody good drink or five. You'll have earned it.

2. One step at a time. Stop thinking of everything up front at once. Do a quick plan... Tackle one exam at a time. One bit of study at a time. Keep it to small manageable chunks.

I know you'll still feel the Earth may crumble... And I'm not knocking what you are studying. But seriously... IT'S GOING TO BE OK! No matter what. Pass or fail. You'll be ok. You'll move on. So try, yes try, to cater a little less.

3. My field of expertise... More accurately... My field of eternal suffering. Those fears of choking etc. I suffer from those enough I've sat in this very ER for related issues numerous times. I hear you on this. It's sometimes more than fear. It is really happening. And it sucks. How can something psychological cause such physical symptoms? It can. Truly. How to manage it? For now, if you don't have time to get help, user some positive affirmations plus distraction.

""I'm fucking fine, I'm going to get this study and exam done then get a kickass gin and tonic!""

""I know these feelings are happening, but I also know I'm going to be ok""

(I'm not trying to encourage drinking afterwards, but more defer what you're doing rather than suggest restrict)

My friend, I KNOW you've got this. I KNOW. 

My last uni subject, I was late to submit final work, I was stressed, feeling all of the things you are. I took the above approach and ended up with a High Distinction (not really sure how).

So dude, go for it. And please feel free to PM me if you want.

I had organised for the staff to come out and greet him, introducing themselves as SHIELD Agents, saying ""Director Fury wishes you a Happy Birthday"".

My children have been through a lot, physical and emotional abuse by their mother. More than kids should. (I have full custody).

These kids are doing great. I attribute a large part of that to the MCU. They suffered a great deal, but kept strong, inspired by the fact that there are 'heroes' in the world. They're not perfect heroes, but they have hearts and do the right thing. They also learnt that there are people that aren't so good. They learnt that they themselves, even as kids, can make a difference.

They were inspired to stay strong. They were inspired to care and show empathy to others. They were encouraged to be healthy. They were encouraged to learn. 

They're still younger than 8yo, and believe in the MCU. I've seen that they needed to. One is building electronics, learning coding and loves science and math (thanks to TS and PP). Another is inspired for fitness and armor.

With a heart forged in the fire of the MCU, they will make the world a better place. They already do."

Overcoming... Whilst it's more complex than can be addressed entirely here, hopefully you'll get some useful pointers.

1. You've got this! You do. You will get past this. Period. So there's a reason to hold your head higher.

2. Do you know the underlying cause of the anxiety? If not, think about it when you're in a safe place. You need this for step 3.

3. See a therapist. Medication can help, but it's not the solution. It can make it easier for you to IMPLEMENT a solution. A therapist will help with strategies.

4. One action at a time. Tackle each task one at a time. Don't think of others until done the current one. No point worrying.

Meanwhile, there are always people here to help as best we can."
Anxiety,eru4x7j,t3_c3yzgy,1561263198.0,Hi. Totally understand. I suggest finding some friends that make you feel BETTER about yourself instead. You'll never look back.
AskMen,eru4uls,t3_c3yz94,1561263129.0,"Don't stress about it. He'll have you assume 'the position' and will get the access he needs. 

Just relax and when he's done ask ""Can you check again?"""
LifeAfterNarcissism,errkisz,t3_c3jxfg,1561173397.0,"I hear you. I understand.

These people will never validate you. Never validate what they've done. And in some ways you'll always have the scars. You're not shocked because it was normal to you.

Accept what has happened. Accept his you feel, or don't feel. It's ok if your body is protecting you. One day when you're ready it may change. 

Get some help, someone to talk to. It will be good to learn strategies to manage emotions.

(I've experienced similar in knowing a mother physically hurting her kids, my kids, but she never gave a shit or cared. In fact, to this day she still thinks she did nothing wrong. I had to learn to manage emotions... I still am)"
Anxiety,erpef5x,t1_erpckek,1561113867.0,"Agreed. I've had all of this. Slowed heart rate hitting into the 30s bpm... Chest pain... Been raced to the ER then spent time in cardiac unit. Result.... Anxiety.

If you feel there IS a problem, then get checked for your own sanity. But if it's anxiety, listen to your body and learn that it can give you these signals."
Anxiety,erpeay9,t1_erpdtse,1561113713.0,"A really good explanation. I second this. I've been unlucky enough to be prescribed Xanax for a long period (over 6 years), only to have government laws change and then have two weeks to ween off. 

After a long time of experiencing different medications, I'll say strongly that the best advice is to exercise and eat healthy. Consistently. A lot. It will change your life."
Ghostbc,erpe55w,t3_c38x6z,1561113498.0,Good on you for sharing the music my friend. I'm hoping to one day share the live experience with my kids. Life is all about these magical experiences.
AskMen,eroytn5,t1_eroxho8,1561092996.0,I came in this thread to say that... (No pun intended)
atheism,eroysid,t1_eroxpuw,1561092964.0,"You're actually right, technically in both instances. In 2016 52% of people identifed as some form of Christian, though this number is declining, a 7% drop since 2011.

""No religion"" is now above 30%.

LifeAfterNarcissism,eroblku,t1_erobjgg,1561074375.0,Recovery from their destruction takes time. I'm glad you have found happiness.
NarcissisticAbuse,ero2kxq,t1_ero2a40,1561066748.0,"Fuck that's horrible dude. But also not surprising. The system is very heavily biased, I guess so is society. I was also almost arrested for times she assaulted me, she was a great liar. Sorry you went through that mate. Hope you're doing ok now."
AmItheAsshole,ermhy7v,t3_c2tyna,1561023683.0,NTA. Relax and be comfortable in yourself because you've done no wrong. You're not dirty or abnormal. You're a human being. He's just jealous...
Anxiety,erm8bt3,t3_c2r7u3,1561010024.0,"Here's a good thing. I care. I care about you and how you're feeling.

I hear you and know these feelings too. Things can get better. They will. Keep your head up and know that with others around you, you WILL stand tall again."
Anxiety,erm87ld,t3_c2rei4,1561009887.0,"You're not alone. Not in the slightest. If only you knew how many others were feeling the same right this very moment. 

Things will be ok. They will get better. 

Make one positive decision today and each day. Today, decide to get help and support. Another day speak to your GP.  Make small decisions and give them time. You've nothing to lose but everything to gain.

I hear you about the thoughts of self harm. I understand. Just know they it will be better. It can be. And push those thoughts out until you speak with a doctor. 

Stay strong. You're stronger than you realise my friend."
