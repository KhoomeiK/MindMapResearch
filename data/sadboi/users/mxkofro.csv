Bro, we all do things we are ashamed of.  ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù people and ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù people both experience humiliating life events.

But,

There is a strong chance that you care about your recent ‚Äúdrama‚Äù a lot more than everyone else does. 

Laugh at yourself. Accept yourself. The rest of the universe will follow your lead.   If things really feel unbearable now, just wait it out.  The good times and the bad times both end

Smoother, longer lasting, and no anxiety

I feel evolved when hypomanic. I am hypersensitive to people‚Äôs moods and pick up on any signs of deception.  I can flirt at a professional level, serve devastating insults, and never get bested in verbal banter. I have no fear of rejection, no fear of consequences, no fear of anything.  

Sex while hypomanic is hard to recall afterwards. I have had it described to me as ‚Äúfucking a psychic werewolf on molly‚Äù.  I enjoyed that description. 

When i am Up I feel godlike, anointed, and blessed. 

The end of the episode is the worst!
It feels like my powers start to weaken, my fears and self consciousness come pack with a vengeance, and then back to baseline.
