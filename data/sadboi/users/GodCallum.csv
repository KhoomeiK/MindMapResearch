It‚Äôs all education systems, UK, America and so on
The most recent largest educational reform in the UK was back in the 80s under Baroness Maggie!

All school does is reinforce a hierarchy, if you don‚Äôt work hard enough you get punished, detention.
If you don‚Äôt fall in line you get detention!

All this sounds rather familiar, working in factories and other dull repetitive jobs!

That‚Äôs because the education system was created back in the 1800s to instil the rigorous process of working in factories during the industrial revolution, and it hasn‚Äôt changed much"

Then look into renewables and use your dividends to buy those shares. Mining and oil companies still produce the best dividend yield but obviously excruciatingly shit for the planet.

Also buy global diversified funds, much safer, more reliable because all the risk is spread over a larger market whereas buying specifically into one market you‚Äôre more likely to loose if that market goes bust.

Furthermore look into new technologies AI and automation."
