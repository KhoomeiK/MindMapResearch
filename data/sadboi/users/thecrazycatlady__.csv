relationship_advice,fqctxjq,t3_ghy8dw,1589268837.0,"23 year old female here, too. I struggle a lot with this also. I spent my formative years deeply depressed, resulting in never developing any hobbies and sort of just doing what I needed to survive. Back then, the idea of picking a career and going to university was pretty nerve-wracking, and I dropped out of school. It took me a year to even commit to doing a Certificate in Business Administration, which I did purely because I didn't want to be serving ice-cream out of a kiosk at 18. Once I'd completed that I started working in Administration positions and that's where I've been since.

I fight a lot with myself about what I want from life. I don't handle stress very well, and working an average full-time job when I'm mentally unwell can sometimes be a problem. Maybe I'll feel differently in a few years when I've worked through the trauma and issues that set me back, but right now I'm sort of content just existing in a way that gets my bills paid, lets me live in a semi-decent apartment and enjoy the occasional meal out or trip away. I feel ambitious in other ways, like when I want to learn new things or take up a new sport. So that's always fun. But for a long time I thought there was something wrong with me for not working toward an 'endgoal career'.

I read today that comparing yourself to others will rob you of the joys you could find in your own life. It's definitely the case with me, I'm a sucker for 'oh, I wish I was X', but I'm working on letting that go. I can't speak for you but if you're anything like me you might have some underlying anxiety about not walking along the path society expects you to walk along - e.g. rejecting the idea that your output into the world equals your worthiness. 

Best of luck OP."

I'd reconsider masturbation if you can explore yourself a bit more because for me, that's sort of how I found out what sort of touching I like. But since this is your first time in a sexual relationship it might just be something you guys have to work on collaboratively - e.g. offering feedback like ""slow down"", ""to the left"", ""not enough/too much pressure"". I find that for myself if I'm not mentally into the sex e.g. I have a lot on my mind its harder for me to reach climax, and the longer it takes the more stressed I feel about it.

It's a bit archaic in a sense but if she wants to live that way and can find someone who wants to be a provider in that sense, then all the power to her. 

But is that want you want? A sugar baby-esque relationship with someone who doesn't want to pay anything but has no issues telling you what she wants from you?

She seems very shortsighted. I'm the type of woman who believes in 50/50 for a relationship. If the date or outing was my idea, I'd pay.

Its one thing to not have any career direction and a very normal and fine thing at her age but surely she wants to do *something*? This conversation will allow you to segue into a serious conversation about money and spending habits. I think you should clarify some of the above with her (e.g. not seeing a drink while going out as important or necessary when she clearly does). If she believes these things to be an important part of a relationship and you don't, maybe breaking up isn't a terrible idea. It might seem silly to break up over it but she's not happy, its bringing you down, and different opinions on money will create huge issues in the future.

My partner and I have similar ideals on money. We like to save so that when we do want to go to concerts, sporting events, shows, dinner, we can do this without feeling guilty. In my opinion you can't have a functional lifestyle or relationship without discipline around things like going out and spending money. If I could, I'd eat out every night, go to every concert, go out every weekend, buy clothes when I want - but that just isn't possible if I want to actually save any money for emergencies or fun. 

Another thing that sticks out to me is the fact that she wants to go out on dates, but won't initiate or pay for these dates. That's very 1950's of her. Why should you fund a dinner date that on average costs twice the amount of cooking a meal when you're content with staying home and cooking together?"

Frugality has nothing to do with loss of a spark, its a lack of effort perhaps on both ends. Does she ever treat *you* to a date night? 

I have lived with and met a lot of exotic dancers or topless waitresses, and they all loved money and partying. Is this something she can live without for a short time?

CasualConversation,fivvhfy,t1_fivulge,1582768977.0,"Thanks for your comment. I agree with this too, but lately have been struggling with the fact that I abused pot through my formative years and therefore didn't develop any sort of personality beyond being super depressed. I'm excited but also nervous to try new things. What hobbies do you enjoy?"
CasualConversation,fivve8g,t1_fivuipt,1582768919.0,"I used to have a cat. His name was Frankie and I rescued him at six months old. He was my best friend for 18 months until he developed an aggressive lymphoma in his tummy. I miss him everyday. Lately my living situation has meant I can't adopt another little furry friend, and I'm really feeling that. I miss having something unconditional like the love of a pet, having something to take care of. Makes you feel like you've got some sort of purpose even if it is just being a Food God for a cat. There is a cat cafe in my city, maybe I'll spend an afternoon there soon."
CasualConversation,fivv5xh,t1_fivuer8,1582768771.0,"I am definitely someone who likes to look for 'the little things' in life. You know, like a good view or birds playing and singing together. A random encounter with a cat, or a funny joke. I think sometimes this might be the only way I hold on to any type of hope. But it's hope nonetheless."
AskReddit,fivv0jp,t1_fivupui,1582768676.0,I also enjoy finding the beauty in the little things. Something as simple as a songbird can turn your day around <3
AskReddit,fivuxpx,t1_fivu8k5,1582768626.0,"I was mostly curious because the things I remember being on YouTube when I was younger were definitely nowhere near the 'quality' or variety of content you'd get these days. I remember watching Shane Dawson's 'Shanaynay' videos, and that guy Fred who made his voice super high-pitched. Stuff I couldn't stand today. But these days it seems like you can make a YouTube for almost anything and I guess I figured these days it would be easier to find something to get into enough that it helps form part of your identity. I'm glad you found something that makes you feel that way. I'm yet to find something that makes me exited to learn again."
AskReddit,fivslb1,t1_fivrpv1,1582767128.0,Right in the feels my dude
AskReddit,fivsgk6,t1_fivrssv,1582767042.0,I like this. Reflection is important.
AskReddit,fivsfvt,t1_fivrqbm,1582767029.0,"Do you mind if I ask how old you are? I'm 23 years old and was raised in the time where technology was sort of only just developing. So for me, I didn't start watching YouTube until my mid-teens and even then never really got into the blogging thing."
AskReddit,fivs9tu,t1_fivrl21,1582766922.0,Do you mean this in a reflective way? I like this. We can't move forward without first acknowledging who we were.

LSD,fivs0un,t3_fa42ma,1582766763.0,Shpongle! That is my SHIT! Listen to Brain In A Fish Tank or The God Particle. OR watch this! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAZSy-W0gA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAZSy-W0gA)
AmItheAsshole,fivrtlt,t3_fa42vo,1582766631.0,"NAH. I don't think you'd be the asshole at all, but I'm a sucker for gifts and giving gifts so I'd be super excited to be doing what you're doing. Maybe write a list of pros and cons and consider things like: is he employable enough to get a job quickly, does his industry have a lot of open job vacancies? Think about how long you're likely to be without two incomes and think about whether or not your income alone could keep you afloat if you were frugal enough. I like the idea of celebrating his birthday with what might be considered a grand gesture before you guys do have to start living like hermits."
Psychedelics,fit0r7h,t3_f9omfk,1582699694.0,"Anything by Shpongle, however my personal favorites are: Brain In a Fish Tank, How The Jellyfish Jumped the Mountain,  When Shall I Be Free,  Connoisseur of Hallucinations, The God Particle. But my favorite thing is to put on the ""Nothing Lasts...But Nothing Is Lost"" album and listen to that start to finish. It's good shit.

Psychedelics,fit07q7,t3_f9ovoo,1582699094.0,"I think I believe in a mixture of the two. I believe it expands our minds in ways we can't comprehend. I do believe we are physical beings and occupy this space, but I also believe that this existence as we know it is just one part of a larger Universe, almost as if being Human is just one of the many ways we can exist in this plane. Sort of like the first step of our Evolution as Souls.

In saying that, I use LSD mostly for stress relief and mindfulness. It has shown me parts of myself I forgot existed. I don't use it to 'visit another plane', I usually go into trips with the mindset that ""I will learn what I need to Learn"" whether its something about myself or if I continue to develop my thoughts on who/why/what we are."
relationship_advice,fisyev1,t3_f9nwo6,1582697223.0,"This is a hard one. I'm all for 'my body, my rules', but I also believe that the rules change when you commit to being in a relationship with someone. I am a drug user (recreational) myself but drug-taking is something I consider to be a selfish act, because of the risks involved. And because of that, I simply wouldn't do those types of things if my partner weren't into them too. The way I see it is that if you're willing to commit to a relationship you have to be open to changing behaviors like that. 

Have you talked to her about why it makes you uncomfortable? Is this something you're willing to work with, or is it a deal-breaker for you? The stigma surrounding recreational drug use and your experience with it might be why she is hesitant to tell you.

I think you have two options. Both start with you telling her your experience and why it concerns you so much. Your concern is natural and normal. From there you can either give her the ultimatum of 'its me or the drugs', or you can tell her that while she may not be willing  to give them up that you'd rather work together to make it as safe as possible for her, and stress free for you. Ways to do this might involve ordering testing kits (so she can test her drugs), coming to an agreement where she tells you when shes doing them, with who and how much. If you want to stay with her she should know that she can call you at anytime from anywhere if she needs you."

relationship_advice,fi9d0yu,t3_f765jw,1582261882.0,His reaction was extremely disproportionate to what happened. This is a huge red flag and you should be concerned about this. You don't solve violence with more violence. Believing in this 'an eye for an eye' mentality is worrying.
Drugs,fi9c98d,t1_fi986rz,1582261231.0,"Admittedly, there are some people out there who don't believe they are in need of any sort of help, but the majority of addicts I've met are aware they have a serious problem and they just don't have the strength or heart to go through recovery alone. It really is easier just to have another hit then face your demons. And I really hope that one day that's not the case."

Your childhood actually sounds ripe with neglect. If you want to go NC, go NC. Don't justify it to anyone. As long as you can say you've made a decision that is good for your health, then do what you need to do. You deserve to let go and you deserve three-ply. What the fuck is that about newspaper?!"
