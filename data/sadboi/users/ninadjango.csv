BariatricSurgery,f7a6vhk,t3_duvhup,1573521926.0,A few minutes after she drinks alcohol her sugar drops rapidly and her body craves more to regulate . That’s why she’s drinking so much and she doesn’t even probably know except she feels great when drinking and food for a few minutes and then soon after she is shaky and yucky (hypoglycemia reactive ). She didn’t replace food with alcohol . That’s been disproven . It’s about her blood sugar . This is serious because she may also be dependent on alcohol and may need detox . Can you section her to treatment ? Can you go get a therapist and ask them for their advice or help? She’s risking her life and probably doesn’t realize it . I feel bad for her
