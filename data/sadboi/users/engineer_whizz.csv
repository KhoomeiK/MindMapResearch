stopdrinking,fr4g6xg,t3_gmmekx,1589887214.0,"This kind of interaction with former drinking friends is a normal part of early sobriety. I've written about it in the past:

""-  You no longer drinking is like a mirror to them. If you were a problem  drinker, most likely a lot of your friends are problem drinkers as well.  You're pointing out their moral 'weakness' when you show you can live  without drinking. They do this because they want to feel comfortable  with themselves again.

\- People  that don't have an alcohol problem don't understand how it feels to have  an alcohol problem. It's like I don't understand how it is to long for a  cigarette as I've never smoked. These people that can moderate, view life through their experiences. They think that if you try hard enough,  you can moderate as well. I know that that's impossible for me, after  trying many many times. Total abstinence is the only thing that keeps my  alcohol use in bay, at exactly 0.

I  remember that people don't take your sobriety seriously until about 6  months. They're like 'he'll return to his normal self after a while'.  Once you go over 1 year, you start to become a source of inspiration,  and those that doubted you at first will start to support you. This  mechanism sucks, but it's how it is.

You'll also gain a lot of new soberfriendly friends and lose a lot of drinker friends. I think that's inevitable.""

I'd add that how more fundamental drinking is to your drinking buddies, the more outspoken these interaction will be. If you have an athletic friend that drinks 1 beer after exercise, he'll be less hard on you, compared to friends that go to weekly beertasting or winetasting. This last group will slowly drift away as your sobriety strengthens. On the other hands, the new friends I found in sobriety are a much better fit."

What about this part?

If you forget about your height for a moment. What are some aspects that you can work on that can make you more desirable?

Suggestions:

\- Get more fit

\- Wear better fitting and more stylish clothing

\- Start doing improv once it's possible again to improve your social skills. Or some other kind of theatre.

\- Get a fresh new haircut

\- Write about things that you like about yourself. Write about where you'd like to be in some years with the cards you've been dealt.

\- Do therapy to work through your inner turmoil in a healthy way

Don't expect results immediatly. In my younger years I was a total nice-guy (tm). I didn't know how to talk to girls, I didn't know how to flirt. I was insecure and a drunk, because that was a way to calm my inner demons. Not surprisingly I didn't have a lot of success with girls then. I couldn't even believe someone would be interested, so even if someone was interested, I wouldn't know what to do or i dismissed it as something that I interpreted wrongly.

After a bout of depression I've made some big changes in my life. What happened then was that I started having more and more female friends. After a while more confident and better looking me also got more sensual interest from girls and I learned how to flirt and stuff. There's no immediate results. I'd say this process took 2 years, from the bout of depression to a new way of being. Later I quit the drink, which pushed my confidence and social skills up after another 2 years. The takeaway here is that the process of self-change is a continuum."

3. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is  experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation,  or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.

You can look athletic if you adapt healthy eating habits and exercise habits. This could be a good start: [https://www.webmd.com/diet/lose-weight-fast#1](https://www.webmd.com/diet/lose-weight-fast#1)

To lose 1-2 pounds per week, you need to have a calory deficit of 500-1000 kcal per day. One pound of fat tissues is about 3500 kcal.

How to change your diet: No more cookies and chips, no more soda or other sugar rich drinks. Drink you coffie black or with skim milk. Drink tea, this is calory free if you don't add sugar. Drink a lot of water. Make your own dinners, because supermarket dinners are filled with salts and fat. Eat extra veggies in all meals. Eat fruits or veggies as snacks between meals. The first days will be hard, your body is used to eating unhealthy things. You'll have some withdrawal simptoms from deleting a lot of sugar from your diet. After a while slowly your body will start feeling more clean. It's like a bicycle chain that was full of dirt and grime that has been cleaned. Now your body will just start functioning better. You'll have clearer skin, more energy, feel less bloated.

Edit: and it goes without saying: no smoking and no drinking. alcohol is very calory rich and damages your liver. smoking damages your lungs and will make your physical progress slower. And smokers smell really bad."

Some important notes here:

\- You no longer drinking is like a mirror to them. If you were a problem drinker, most likely a lot of your friends are problem drinkers as well. You're pointing out their moral 'weakness' when you show you can live without drinking. They do this because they want to feel comfortable with themselves again.

\- People that don't have an alcohol problem don't understand how it feels to have an alcohol problem. It's like I don't understand how it is to long for a cigarette as I've never smoked. These people that can moderate view life through their experiences. They think that if you try hard enough, you can moderate as well. I know that that's impossible for me, after trying many many times. Total abstinence is the only thing that keeps my alcohol use in bay, at exactly 0.

I remember that people don't take your sobriety seriously until about 6 months. They're like 'he'll return to his normal self after a while'. Once you go over 1 year, you start to become a source of inspiration, and those that doubted you at first will start to support you. This mechanism sucks, but it's how it is.

You'll also gain a lot of new soberfriendly friends and lose a lot of drinker friends. I think that's inevitable."
stopdrinking,fpcb9cu,t1_fpbkg5j,1588494067.0,"A good first step is recognizing which feelings cause your distress. Can you name these feelings? If you can't readily find the words, the feelings wheel can help you out: [http://feelingswheel.com/feelings-wheel.jpg](http://feelingswheel.com/feelings-wheel.jpg)

Once you know which feelings cause you distress, you can write about constructive ways to deal with these feelings within your realm of possibilities. Writing about my troubles always makes me more creative in finding solutions instead of wallowing in the sadness. As a bonus it helps me sleep as well.

I'm not a psychologist, but these are some things I learned in therapy. I can't advise therapy enough for people in recovery to develop their emotional abilites."

Sharing your craving feelings is very important in my opinion. When you put these nagging, self-destructive thoughts in the light of the outside world, I find they shrink and get so much easier to handle. Good job on you for seeking social support when you're having a difficult time."
stopdrinking,fpard8j,t3_gccrcy,1588454112.0,"I remember in the first months that I have gone sober, that negative emotions just piled up a lot. I thought about how easy it'd be to just numb them out. This is not a unique feeling amongst starting sober people.

While drinking, we've let healthy coping mechanisms atrophy. We have a poor toolbox in ways to handle distress and problems in life. You feel stress ==> drink. You didn't get a job ==> drink. You got stood up on a date ==> drink. You don't feel like you belong in a social group? ==> drink.

In sobriety we have to relearn all these things. That can make sobriety difficult. But it's worth it. It's the best decision I've made in my life. The first months are the hardest. But every time you get through a difficult moment without drinking, your toolbox gets a new tool. Over time your toolbox will be full and you'll learn that drinking is just like putting a poster over a hole in the wall, you're not confronted with it anymore, but the problem doesn't get solved.

Edit: can you share these feelings with your partner? Having a social support network is crucial in sobriety."
