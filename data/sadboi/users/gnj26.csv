I also suspect I may be on the spectrum. I dropped out of university a year ago and I plan on going back to school for my associates. It shouldn't take too long since I already have around 40 credits from university, but my parents are also getting older and my dad keeps talking about retirement. So I'm hoping I can get a job decent enough after that to move out and support myself or at least get my bachelor's from a cheap state school so I don't have to take out any more loans. I'm really starting to feel old tbh lol. My body feels like it's definitely no longer a teenager but my surroundings say otherwise. You're not alone and honestly we're all winging it."

I'm in my 20s now, but my siblings are married with children and are probably figuring out how to navigate this same issue with their kids. 

OP can still give it a shot, though. Older siblings were a teenager more recently than your parents and could probably try negotiating with them."
NoStupidQuestions,fowqx2d,t3_g9nlna,1588125256.0,I didn’t have a choice. Freshman who weren’t commuting were required to live in the dorms. single rooms were reserved for people with disabilities so I had to adapt and suck it up. Lived with 2 others in a small room at one point and it was bothersome at some times but I dealt with it. I suspect that I may be autistic so I’d probably qualify for a single room now but it doesn’t matter because I passed that stage of life.

GenZ,fnupqfa,t3_g3pf9x,1587267931.0,"Yeah definitely. I graduated HS in 2016 and was on a decent path at the beginning but kind of fell off the tracks. I ended up choosing the wrong college \*twice\* because I had no idea what I wanted to major in. So I dropped out and decided to take a year off last May and I'll be working to get my associates at community college in the fall. Which is probably what I should have done in the first place.

My high school was a college prep school so I felt a lot of pressure during college application season, and basically only applied to schools I found visually pleasing and that people talked about a lot. I wasn't interested in CC because I did feel like I needed so independence, but mainly because I knew it was ""expected"" of me to go to a 4 year school because I was one of the honors students. Luckily my parents didn't pressure me to go to any particular school but I definitely felt it from my teachers and classmates.

Which brings me to now, 4 years after graduation and kind of feeling like I wasted them. Most of my classmates will be graduating from their university this spring or graduated in December and I feel super pathetic. Especially since the career path I want to follow (filmmaking) isn't known for a steady income. Coronavirus lockdown preventing me from being able to take any further steps at the moment besides watching YouTube and writing scripts is just the icing on the cake. I try not to be hard on myself though because I know you aren't supposed to have it all figured out at this age. And knowing that I could possibly be on the spectrum could be why I didn't really thrive after high school and without the structure of it.

So yeah, you're not alone, but be grateful for what you do have. It's great that you have a good job during these times. There is sooooo much more to life than high school and you still have plenty of life ahead of you."

GenZ,fnmyxis,t1_fn6uomr,1587080912.0,"I feel like it’s Millennials who most commonly have this reaction. Don’t get me wrong, there are people like this from every generation. But I feel like millennials have the most tendency to due it because they are just starting to get used to no longer being the new kids on the block—the block being adulthood and the workforce. Gen X and older are a bit more “mature and wise” and kind of used to the fact of younger people working beside them. possibly because many of them have kids who are either in the same age group as their younger coworkers or have kids who have already passed that stage of their life."
GenZ,fnmshs1,t3_g1mtra,1587077307.0,"Yes it does feel kind of old considering my oldest memories are from that time period. I think all the early 2000s nostalgia/starter packs and the revival of early 2000s fashion definitely make it feel more like yesterday. I know my perspective will definitely be different from someone who was a little bit more mature and conscious during this time, but this is my perspective:

There was definitely a big shift around 2005/2006 where companies started changing their logos, digital was becoming the default and analog obsolete, flatscreen TVs becoming mainstream, and everything just seemed to feel...different. 

I feel like there was a second shift around 2013 that started to prepare us for the way our society is today as far as technology, memes, car design, smartphones, many companies simplifying their “overly detailed and three dimensional” looking logos that they made in the mid to late 2000s. 

If I were to go back to 2002 I’m sure a lot of things would be the same but I’d still have that “yesterday” feeling. Still being able to buy a VCR at your local WalMart and seeing teenage girls thinking a clear plastic phone being the coolest thing ever. I’d probably still be super fascinated by the concept of touchscreens like I was when iPhones and iPads first came out and how it was so “futuristic” to me.

I think the furthest I could go back without things feeling at least a *little* dated would probably be 2014 tbh. Once again, this is just the perspective of a young person and I know things kind of start to blur together if you experienced these years as an adult."

pastlives,fm3i3aq,t3_frt573,1585724282.0,"Very interesting, I just used the same video you linked and...I'm shocked.

I think this was the first time it actually worked for me. I know I'm an imaginative person but I'd never cry over a tragedy that I simply imagined the way I did after I saw what I saw.

I started off as a very little girl (maybe about 2-3) years old. My name was Bella. The year was 1916 and I lived in Burbank, California. I seemed to have a really close connection with my grandfather, and as I got older I became an author (pretty similar to my aspirations now). I was also very skilled horse jockey. When the meditation said to think of the worst memory, I was immediately in Bella's house on the floor, hiding in the corner crying. I kept hearing gunshots and my husband (I assume) consoled me then went to get his own gun. I'm okay now but during this my chest closed up and I just wanted to bawl. I just cried and cried after I came back to present day reality. I think both Bella and her husband survived. I think she may have died from a respiratory issue. 

If it weren't for my emotional reaction I probably would have never believed it. I definitely would like to try again and see another life but first take a while to mentally prepare myself."

It’s possible I could have seen one or two episodes when I was very young. but whenever I think of that intro I always imagine myself in a house that looks nothing like mine or my grandparents with 70s/80s decor playing as a little girl in front of a big sliding door, and it’s raining outside. and the cartoon is playing on a little brown wood case TV.
