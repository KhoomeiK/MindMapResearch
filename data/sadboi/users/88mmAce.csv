FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

• Rudeness towards other Redditors, • Spreading incorrect information, • Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s. , •Problematic behavior towards Women and PoC, • And disrespecting the Hecking Marvel

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

I am comforted by the fact that it is not my fault, and that my suffering is the result of a shallow society. I am similarly comforted by the fact that I am not alone,  although it is much colder, considering that this means that other people suffer the same as I do.

> Toxic masculinity 

I hate a lot of feminists for this reason. The retarded projection. I was horribly bullied all my life, at 16 I was kicked out of my house. The homeless shelter was turned into a women’s only DV shelter during my third week there and I nearly froze to death multiple times over the course of the next few years. A few people I knew did. Despite that I still graduated school. No one even knew. No one cared enough to know.

I have a place now by the skin of my teeth, but odds are that this COVID thing is going to take this from me too.

I have no friends, family or loved ones. All of my attempts to find any have failed. People only see what’s left of my face.

But for DARING to be even mildly annoyed that people are so uselessly superficial and shallow, I’m a misogynist

At some point that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
