ptsd,fqwl6ba,t3_gl8qxt,1589708510.0,"I am so sorry you‚Äôre going through this.  I totally relate in the sense that I lost my virginity to rape and it still pisses me off when people invalidate my feelings or say ‚Äúyou could have had it worse.‚Äù  This is why I don‚Äôt open up to many people about being raped because in my culture it is taken as being the woman‚Äôs fault.  It has taken years of therapy though I sometimes get flashbacks and honestly, it‚Äôs sucks. How I have worked through some of my things is I don‚Äôt trust people and I keep my circle very small.  The only
People who know the full extent of my rapes, abuse, etc are my husband, my best friend, and my little sister.  I also have a difficult time trusting my middle sister so I keep cordial with her but I don‚Äôt have that tight relationship with her, because I can‚Äôt fully trust her due to the fact that she can sometimes lack empathy and she is very judgmental.  

My advice, find a very good therapist and work with DBT therapy.  It sucks going through DBT but in the long run it helps.  I have been in and out of therapy for 15 years and have been diagnosed with PTSD complex, Major Depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and Obsessive compulsive disorder.  If someone isn‚Äôt adding positivity in your life it‚Äôs okay to set boundaries and cut them out.  I have had to cut a lot of people out of my life because it is what is best for me."

Ironically enough I woke up to a horrible night tremor with him in it giving me a warning.  It has been a shitty day since.  This too shall pass.  You‚Äôre not alone and we are stronger than this.  It‚Äôs perfectly normal to have bad days, but better ones are yet to come.  Stay strong! Sending you positive vibes and prayers ‚ù§Ô∏è"

It seems like your MIL has her own issues to work through.  Do what I did, block her from contacting you.  You don‚Äôt need that negativity around you.  My MiL is the same way except she told my husband to leave me and get an apartment with her.  Nope, I am a depressant with PTSD and anxiety.  If you can‚Äôt add anything positive to my life get out.  You can‚Äôt control what she does or doesn‚Äôt do, just how you respond.  Don‚Äôt let her get to you.  She will realize her wrongs later in life."
alcoholicsanonymous,fqhsb2u,t1_fqhljnk,1589383475.0,"Wow, thank you for your supportive response.  Firstly, different things work for different people.  As someone with extreme anxiety and depression I hate speaking on the phone.  I would rather have a root canal.  I do a lot of prayer and meditation and don‚Äôt rely 100% on AA.  And actually wouldn‚Äôt those classify as steps 10 and 11?  

I will post again on Nov 1 to confirm my 7 year sobriety.  I keep my promises irregardless of my disease.  I won‚Äôt succumb to a disease when I watched my cousin fight the fight of his life against cancer.  To fall back on that is not something I will do.  

This is the kind of crap that strays people away from AA, those who act like they are holier than thou.  Great job staying sober, please repeat and really concentrate on your step 10 today."

In her 60s, no money, lives with an abusive boyfriend who uses her for her money, whatever little she has.  Apparently he has been sick, but she also knows when he is gone she had no money no house nothing.  This is her attempt at getting some stability.  She fucked up her own life, not my husbands responsibility or burden to pay her debts for her.  When her first two kids were young she lost custody of both.  She is a fuck up and has had multiple opportunities to fix her life.  She knows I won‚Äôt allow that BS.  Fuck her.  So I cut her ass out of my life. If she continues to talk shit- she‚Äôll be served with a no contact order.  So over her.  Stick your ground and just block her you‚Äôll feel better and she loses power."

It‚Äôs definitely hard being from immigrant backgrounds with very old school ideology.

Now, she has been with her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù for almost 20 years, and in that time never engaged.  Then the night before our wedding she gets engaged and tried to boast about it the day of our wedding. I shut that shit down real quick.  Her dress was flashy as hell, and being that my family is a conservative old school Catholic family I asked her to be conservative and not flash her implants.  She managed not to do that but her gown looked like a ridiculous disco ball.  Oh, btw she‚Äôs no longer engaged.  She insisted on making a speech at our wedding...and the dance with my husband she cried like she was going to lose him or like someone had died.  Needless to say she pissed me off that day and she still does today...best revenge- we have the video and I asked the videographer to keep her falling on her ass on the dance floor in the video."
