They’re supposed to report if your at harm to yourself or others. But I am harming myself so doesn’t that count? At one point are they obligated to report me? If I’m suicidal? I think about it but don’t want to carry it out. does that make me suicidal? I’m just worried

Lol but I also experienced low appetite, lost 30 pounds, and was nauseous/throwing up when I was very depressed and unmedicated. So I guess that’s just how my body reacts no matter what. No idea if that correlates to my side effects from meds. So I wouldn’t say there is no medication like that. But maybe he means ones that will work with your epilepsy?"

Wellbutrin is really throwing off my appetite so I’m kinda worried about that. Im surprised he prescribed that much. I think 150mg is way too much for at first. That’s probably why you had an adverse effect. My psychiatrist slowly increased the dosages over time so that my body could get used to it. It might take an increase, different prescription, or a blend of two meds. I’m still trying to figure out what will work best for mine and I’ve been going to a psychiatrist and a therapist for 5 months! Ugh lol, but I’m sure you will find what works for you! Good luck!"

selfharm,f5s7f2y,t1_f5s79hu,1572415036.0,I’ve been on 3 different medications at different dosages since I started seeing a psychiatrist. I never felt a difference while taking lexapro or Zoloft. They both made me nauseous as hell. I just started Wellbutrin after tapering off the Zoloft and I think it might be helping. I’m still testing the waters to see. I might have to increase the dose or take another pill on top of it but I think my psychiatrist and I are finally going in the right direction.
selfharm,f5s6kaj,t3_deww8x,1572413944.0,Psychiatrists are important! It’s not the same as a therapist. They are the ones who can diagnose you and write you a prescription. Taking meds while also going to therapy is the most effective way to beat mental illness.
