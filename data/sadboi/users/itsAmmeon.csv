MercyMains,fpofdk2,t3_gc20bk,1588783563.0,"My skill level decreased when I first started super jumping too. I like to jump when I can’t get to a specific team mate or an easy enemy is hiding somewhere my team can’t really get to (or they just don’t know they’re there). When you’re learning how and when to jump keep in mind when not to jump because I have yet to keep myself under control half the time and I get my head shot off. Don’t be me. Also be careful who your guardian angel is really aiming at. I’ve had multiple incidents where my guardian angel is actual aiming at someone next to who I want to fly to and they are actually more in the mix of the enemies and it always screws me over because I go launching into a swarm. Do not be me. I believe in you, good luck!"

I can cover maybe one or two things when there's twenty and I remember when I get in the car to leave. The memory problems, concentration, and the brain fog are my least favorite symptoms!"
