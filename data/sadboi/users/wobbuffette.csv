I don't get to be alone and am having a lot of issues with who I'm quarantined with, but the minimal interaction with the outside and those in it still has done wonders. It's bad I'm not making money, but I'm no longer vomiting from anxiety over having to go to work every day. I work out twice a day, I eat well, I fixed my sleep schedule for the first time in...I really don't even know how long? I feel like the longer this goes on, the more I'll be able to bring back things I lost to depression. I'm terrified of the virus and want very badly for it to go away, of course, but I don't want *this* aspect of it to end. I'm mentally better off than I have been in years. It's a weird mix that I'm afraid to express publicly. I'm glad to see I'm not alone in this. I hope you and the others in these comments are able to stay healthy and find something that works for you when ""normal"" makes a comeback.

mentalhealth,foo5btj,t3_g8fq4i,1587932800.0,"I've been at this for a few years now after previously being the person who would talk to anyone, anywhere 24/7 (online - but I address that later). It's developed weird sub-habits of sorts that make it more confusing to me. I feel guilty, but certainly not enough to change it, because I *much* prefer not talking to people. I easily prefer this over having all the conversations I had before. But I think it's also had an effect on my anxiety, cuz now when I see a notification on my phone, I get super afraid that someone is trying to talk to me, even if I don't know that's the case yet. Just being physically around other human beings is so stress-inducing. I recently emailed someone back after 2 whole *years*, and that's probably not going anywhere. It's making quarantine really easy, but my brain still occasionally pipes up and asks if this is okay, regardless of my feeling better this way. I sometimes tell myself it's a mistake and I shouldn't be doing it, that eventually I'll want people around again and I'll have ruined that for myself, but when I try to talk to people (even if they're someone I adore or at least enjoy talking to usually), it stresses me out so much that it's not worth the effort anymore. I don't know if this has anything to do that for almost my whole life (with like a 1.5 year exception), all my relationships and interactions were overwhelmingly online because of bullying and unreasonable amounts of social anxiety. (I'm kinda rambling into the void but I hope everyone else who's dealing with this finds a way to navigate it that works for them! Stay safe and healthy, everyone.)"
