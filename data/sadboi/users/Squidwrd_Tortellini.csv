You cannot count on anyone for help. Not your boyfriend, not your mom, not your grandmother, not the people on facebook congratulating you. 

If the father wants the baby that badly, then call a lawyer and see what your options are for giving full custody to the father and removing parental rights and responsibilities from yourself. Unfortunately, you and your boyfriend will likely break up no matter what. He clearly isn't okay with the idea of you giving it up for adoption, and you clearly do not want this kid. One of you is going to be extremely unhappy either way. Let it be him. 

Please do not keep this child. Give it up for adoption or call a lawyer and give it to the father. Do not consult him, your family, or anyone but a lawyer about what you should do or what your plans are. They do not have your best interest in mind, especially your boyfriend. You have to be strong. The only thing that matters here is that you are making the right decision for YOU. No one else's wants or feelings matter right now. Your future is the only thing that matters.
