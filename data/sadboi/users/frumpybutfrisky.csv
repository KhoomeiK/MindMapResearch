Raves,faf3s52,t1_fae3f5y,1576013921.0,"I live in dayton and go to shows all the time! Usually once or twice a week. Cinci has a lot of small venue options actually! Also columbus if you wanna make the drive. Mad frog, thompson house, topcats, bogarts are all in cinci that have shows often and are usually pretty cheap. In columbus you‚Äôve got Skullys, dahlia, bluestone, and otherworld that all put on shows. (There‚Äôs even more options for both cities I just can‚Äôt think of them off the top of my head) If you download the app Edmtrain you can put in cinci and it‚Äôll give you all the upcoming shows in the area. I usually spend 15-40 bucks per show which I know is a big range but don‚Äôt be afraid to go to the cheaper shows of people you‚Äôve never heard of because they are still fun! Half the shows I go to I don‚Äôt know the djs that are playing. Sorry I know that‚Äôs long but I hope that helps. This coming Thursday Riot Ten has a show at Thompson house!"
