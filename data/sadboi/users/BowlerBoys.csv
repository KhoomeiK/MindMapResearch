However, my mind was quickly distracted by the commotion coming from the boy's toilets. I had some time, so I investigated. As I made my way through the crowd of people gagging and yelling variations of ""NAHHH, THESE KIDS ARE RAW"", I managed to confront the source of the excitement. 

In the only stall that existed in this bathroom was a toilet stuffed with some poor lad's backpack. On top of this was a single log of shit, with a spec of sweetcorn that seemed to stare at me. It was intimidating. 

There is a photo somewhere, but I will have to contact some really old friends and do some digging to find it."

I was in secondary school during the late 00s onwards.

When I and many other pupils in the school I went to were being bullied, we would report everything we could. However, punishments were scarce. In fact, I got into more trouble than my bullies, because when I fought back, I was thrown into isolation or exclusion. 

I once got choked in the PE changing room, but I was the one to be punished, because I threatened to hurt him if he didn't let go. My sincerity made him cry. Such a pathetic system.

I'm okay now, though! I came out of it a better man üôÇ."
