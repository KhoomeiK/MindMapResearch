If we can keep up the good work on the other side of the ball, all we need to do is figure out something that works on offense and we will be contenders again. But only putting up 3 points until the 4th quarter is unacceptable. We really need to step it up on offense."

Far and away the least talented band in the set, but they still put on a pretty good show for the couple songs I recognized. They're a mainstream band in a genre that's anything but. A fringe, niche taste, and I'll admit I haven't acquired it. I agree they're very overhyped though"
