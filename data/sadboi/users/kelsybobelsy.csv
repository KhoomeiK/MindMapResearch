Here's the thing. Neither party is truly ""more progressive"" than the other. Yes, media focuses on topics that are polarizing, but in action it is different. 

Just because a politician backs ""so and so"" policy does not mean in reality that's the purpose of the grants/laws etc they support. 
  
Look at any politician just by their actions and you'll see most just look out for themselves. It's not about change, but their party/ money in their own pockets.

 Also, some basic sex ed. It wasn't our goal per say, but the need made itself clear quickly. We are finding that the lack of sex ed/ healthy relationship education is making it easier for women to be abused, because they don't know what's normal.

If you work full time (40hrs)  at minimum wage (7.25 hr) you would make 1,600 a MONTH. And that's not including the taxes taken out. 
 
I  work about 35 hours a week. Which is typical here as most employers don't allow over 40hrs a week. If you work over 40 they have to give you over time payment and possibly medical insurance. Some weeks I'll get close to 40, but it fluctuates.

Dogtraining,fhaa4qr,t3_f22bfw,1581401957.0,"It's common unfortunately. Keep doing what you're doing, but I'd stop worrying about how others react. That's their ignorance speaking. 

My pit was a rescue as well, and she is truly the sweetest dog I've ever had. Super super smart, but a bit stubborn. 

It might help to join some pit groups for support and affirmation. There are a few on Facebook and even some here on reddit."
AskReddit,fha59bi,t3_f1y5hc,1581397575.0,"My dad convinced my sister and I that he had ""the monkey disease."" He would randomly start acting like a monkey in spouts and it was ""out of his control"". He even threw items out of the refrigerator one time like a gorilla, and stuck a baby carrot in his nose! 

The story behind the disease had an intense plot that involved a zoo trip (another story), and a serious sit down discussion about what happened to him, what to do to protect ourselves if he behaved like a monkey, and everything else. 

He has a wild imagination."
AmItheAsshole,fh8kszn,t1_fh8ambe,1581361850.0,But she's already pregnant.....
AmItheAsshole,fh89usi,t3_f1pi3r,1581355189.0,"YTA. 

There is a lot to say here, but one point is basic. 

The alternative is an abortion or putting the baby up for adoption. 

No one should be forced to do either because they got irresponsibly pregnant. It is what it is now and it is their choice only. 

I'm pro-choice, but that doesn't mean I'd ever tell a person to get an abortion or give up a child because I don't agree with their lifestyle.  Sounds like the family is just making the best out of the situation. 


Also, all if this is NOT OP'S BUSINESS."
AmItheAsshole,fh893rg,t1_fh81rkf,1581354726.0,"It's pretty common to be living pay check to pay check at that age. I'm 27 and I'd say it applies to me most singles in my life. Especially because of student loans and lack of WELL PAYING jobs. I work two jobs above minimum wage and still live pay check to pay check. I had to drop out of school because I couldn't afford to pay my bills and continue my education. Even with student loans. I wish I could live with my parents like this guy ,because then I could finish college and get a better job.  I haven't given up on my goal to go back to school, but it will probably have to be years down the line after I save enough, or until I find a scholarship. 


I think his girlfriend being an alcoholic is a separate issue to be addressed and being on welfare shouldn't be looked down upon without knowing the situation. It's not easy to get unless you have a child. At least in my state."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fgo6m54,t3_eziuzd,1580961055.0,"So her dad is the fucking stupid one right? Because that's totally normal for a kid to say.

 Also, I know this is anecdotal as everyone is different, but my man is black I'll sometimes refer to him as my chocolate such and such when we are in private using pet names and we both see it as endearing.  Of course each person has their own feelings on such things. I wouldn't say that to a stranger, or really even to my partner in front of one. 

I would  use this as a learning opportunity for the kid, but they aren't stupid for saying this. The dad is for reacting in such a harsh way. 


 Maybe I'm misunderstanding this sub. It is just too much sometimes."
