Routine:

(Sorry for the goofy faces. I'm tired.)


So, during this lockdown I attempted to have a healthier hair routine.


Previous routine: 

* Any OGX shampoo usually tsubaki blossom, Vitamin E, argan oil or bamboo fiber full), serving of around 3/4 inch diameter on my hand.

* Wash and rinse immediately.

* Apply the matching OGX conditioner and let it sit while I wash my body. More or less the same amount of the Shampoo.

* Rinse.

* Dry with a towel (just squeezing) and roll my hair up inside a towel.

* Comb with a wooden comb while still wet.

* Let it dry.


New routine:

* First two steps are the same.

* Now I applied conditioner and used a wide toothed plastic comb inside the shower to go through my wet, conditioned hair. Head upside down. I parted it and I rinsed it

* just squeezed the extra water with my hands, no towel

* I didn't touch it until it was dry.


The idea was just to avoid combing my hair while still damp, so I was surprised when it dried and I found those sort of waves.

My hair is usually so straight that people ask me if I iron it everyday, which I don't. 

I was born with curly hair, supposedly, and it straightened out when I turned around one or two years old.

My father has curly hair and my mother has wavy hair.

Do you think I should treat my hair as if it were wavy / curly instead of straight?

Or maybe it just dried in a funny way?

What broke the deal was the fact that he got all defensive and even compared me to her when I confronted him, as if to justify his actions, but still insisted that he was innocent.

I decided I couldn't really trust him nor move over it since he refused to take responsibility or agree that his behavior was out of place in a committed relationship.

My last paragraph is my advice to you. If you feel he lacks sincerity, maybe you can't trust him again and that's completely valid. Still, I understand it must be frightening for him to lose you and that's why he could be telling you a watered down version of the story, but that's not the best way to deal with the situation at hand.

His story really doesn't make sense, though. Perhaps you know him well enough to identify the signs when he lies. Perhaps logic is enough.

I got the idea because once I gave him a little box of his favorite chocolates and I noticed he ate one whenever he needed to be cheered up.

I'll try to explain myself. Mostly to vent out my guilt. You don't have to read it.

1. I can't make all people exactly the same priority since I'd have no time to reply to everyone. I'd just be on my phone the whole day. Sometimes when I'm struggling it's even more difficult to make time for people I care a lot about.

2. I know that's wrong towards each individual person - it's not their fault whatever's going on in my side that prevents me from replying.

3. I feel guilty. I know it's wrong. That guilt consumes me and I'm unable to go past it in order to reply.

4. The guilt becomes so much that I'd have to type a lengthy text to everyone I've ignored and I'd have to expose myself a lot and be very vulnerable and basically plead for forgiveness and usually I have no energy to go through that.

5. I sometimes broadcast messages saying that I can't chat, but they expect me to be 100% offline. I shouldn't need to have to explain that if my boss or my mother text, I can't just keep not replying. I feel observed and jailed.

So creepy."
BPD,fmbe1qg,t1_fmbaw7d,1585924452.0,"I started dating this guy some three weeks before the stay-at-home recommendation.

I really didn't think this isolation would have such an adverse impact on me so quickly.

It's been more than three years since the last time I spent one full day 100% at home.

I wish you luck on maintaining this new relationship!"

Thank you for reading and commenting!"

I care, intellectually."
insaneparents,fm9843k,t1_fm7k8km,1585863518.0,"No, chingona (or ching√≥n) doesn't mean fucker. But chingar does mean something similar to ""to fuck"", among other things (like to consume, to bother, to annoy, to kill, even...). Quite a versatile verb.

In this conversation, the mother means something like, ""I hope you feel really good about yourself.""

Note: ""Chingada"" means something awful, as in something that is screwed or ruined."
BPD,fm5s2z2,t1_fm5rtrb,1585778836.0,"Yay! Thank you for reading! I'm glad that I'm not the only one. I also thought it was too insane. This is my first time talking about it.

I looked them up. I'd seen them before, but I didn't know they were called that. Thanks!"
BPD,fm5rs2b,t3_ft9cls,1585778664.0,"I was diagnosed at 25, and although I get the reasons behind not diagnosing teenagers, I'm pretty sure I showed super extreme BPD symptoms from the age of 14 onwards, so I get you.

My symptoms became less 'antisocial', but more self-destructive as I aged. They became quieter, somehow.

The diagnosis they gave you is sometimes used as a synonym for BPD, so I think it's good enough for now mostly because you can still get access to DBT, which is where you'd end up anyway with a BPD diagnosis."
BPD,fm4n1st,t3_ft1s1g,1585757153.0,"I think (but I'm no professional) that DBT skills might be helpful for most people regardless of their diagnosis (or lack of diagnosis).

So I'd consider it a good idea to buy the workbook and start working on your own."

I mean
even if you're an alcoholic
that much alcohol in such a short time is simply *too much* for your liver to handle, I think"
