i think you should really talk with your wife about whether or not you can go through this again. not today or tomorrow. Maybe in a week. whenever it's right. keep an open conversation going for a month or more - no one is waiting on your decision. 

for my wife and i, it took about 2 months of talking, thinking, and healing. after those two months, we decided that we really wanted to have this child together, and that collectively we were both strong enough to weather whatever might happen in the future. now she's 30 weeks pregnant and we're expecting a little boy in july. who knows what the future holds, but i'm glad we gave it another shot.

in the mean time, please take care of yourself and your wife. post here if you need to talk about things. I know i found that a lot of people wouldn't really ask how we were doing because they didn't want to talk about unpleasant things. also, a lot of people don't think about the emotional toll on the husband. culturally, we're expected to be stoics, and I know i don't always feel very fucking stoic. if you've got a good buddy you can talk to about this stuff, tell him how you're feeling. coronavirus has made a beer at the bar off limits, but a beer over zoom could do you a lot of good.

most importantly, be there to listen for and comfort your wife, and be ready to share yourself with her. if you do, this will make you a stronger couple with a deeper love, and will only make your home that much more inviting for the baby you two eventually do have.

good luck, and much love."

Same thing with the low anxiety days too. Sunday was a good day for me and it seemed like my PND was basically gone. Now today I'm back to working and I'm getting minor GERD symptoms and the drip is back. Uggggh.

We'll get through this. At least the pollen will fuck off soon!  Lol"
Allergies,foql8wx,t3_g8fxo1,1587996012.0,"I've got the same issue as you, right down to the huge anxiety. I haven't gone to the ER, but there's a couple of times I've wanted to for shortness of breath. In every instance, it's been imagined.

PND started 6 weeks ago, at the twin onset of tree pollen and the local COVID crisis. I was a mess, and ended up with diarrhea, burping, acid reflux and the lump-in-throat feeling for a week and a half.

I've been through a bunch of combos of allergy mess that have eased my allergy symptoms (which were especially bad this year), but nothing helped with the PND/throat weirdness until recently.

I feel like my PND, throat clearing and soreness have gotten much better over the last 4 or 5 days. Here is what I think are the culprits:

* tree pollen is dying down in my area, at least temporarily.
* I am taking treatment of my anxiety seriously. I exercise once a day, avoid the news, meditate 15 min before bed, and have started teletherapy with a psychiatrist.
* I am eating a heartburn resistant diet
* I drink ginger root tea with honey a couple times a day. The ginger is for my stomach, the honey for my throat.
* my doc started me on famotidine before bed for acid reflux.
* I am drinking at least 2 liters of water a day.

My theory is that the throat thing was started by allergies, and exacerbated by anxiety induced acid reflux. Once the acid reflux started irritating my throat, the allergy meds were no help. That means the path to treatment has to start with managing anxiety. It's a hard road, as you know, because even when you're not anxious, the reflux and the allergies still stick around for a bit, ready to make you anxious again. If you can keep.the anxiety at bay though, it does seem to get better."
HealthAnxiety,fol3t23,t3_g7tkq5,1587854328.0,"honestly this sounds exactly like what my allergies do to me. I've had that tickle in my throat (sometimes sore, sometimes not) for 6 weeks now,  ever since the onset of tree pollen season.

If it'd the latter, I recommend warm tea with honey to help manage it."

a lot of humidifiers have a digital display which reads out RH (relative humidity, from 0% [dry] to 100% [fully saturated]). The generally agreed upon area that you want to be in is 40-50% to be comfortable without promoting mold or dustmite growth."
Allergies,fo0jate,t1_fo0gu15,1587414154.0,"You're welcome! 

Yeah one thing that helped me was sleeping with a humidifier set to 45% RH. You don't want it to go above 50% or you'll start running into dust mite and mold conditions. Most humidifiers have a humidity at mode that will allow you to control to certain humidity.

Hot tea with honey is also good for soothing your throat. I'm also hydrating like crazy which seems to help thin out the mucus a bit.

Also just to clarify, claritin is one type of oral antihistamine (loratadine). One of the things you can do is try different types of antihistamine (allegra - fexofenadine, zyrtec - cetirizine, xyzal - levocetirizine) to see if one works better. Dont fool with first gen antihistamines like benadryl during thr day unless your doctor tells you too. Wayyy too drowsy. 

give each antihistamine you try at least a week to try to do its stuff though. The medication works by building up in your bloodstream, so you won't see full results til you're 2 or 3 days in."

It's been a worse allergy season than years past for sure. Usually I just use my nasal spray, but this year I'm doing spray + oral antihistamine every day and still getting limited symptoms.

* you mentioned post-nassl stuffiness, a mild headache and lightheadedness. All of those are unpleasant, but none of them are the three CDC/WHO symptoms to look out for.

* CDC and WHO both say that it takes about 5 days to feel symptoms. If you're feeling them so soon after your trigger, it's probably not COVID.

* the symptoms you describe could all apply to allergies or a mild cold. Although we're all thinking about COVID, many, many, many more people have allergies or colds, so one of those is far more likely to be the cause. 

* these symptom could also be caused by anxiety, which you know you have. Isn't title more likely that you're being affected by something you know you have than by a virus that you can't prove you've even been in contact with?

I hope these thoughts will help you out. I don't think it sounds like you have COVID. You will feel better as soon as you can break the cycle of panic that your anxiety is encouraging."

Definitely gives me angst though because I think ""oh god, this is it! The muscle soreness before a fever!"" It's happened to me about 3x in quarantine so far. 5 weeks, no fever, cough, or shortness of breath to accompany the aches. Also no ALS.

I think it's also important to remember that you probably aren't moving as much as you usually do if you're mostly staying in your house. The aches can also come from underusing your muscles. Maybe getting together an exercise routine might help? I started mine today and am looking forward to the results. For today though, it's just given me a good reason to feel sore, lol."

* doing meditations and breathing exercises in the morning

Although done research suggests that the virus can stay airborne in lab conditions, the intake of your AC unit is far from lab conditions. I'm not sure what kind of unit you have, but here's how improbable it is:

1. Someone would have to be coughing within a few feet of your unit's outdoor air intake (not likely, as these intakes are generally located away from people.)

2. The viral particles would have to be drawn into the intake in great enough numbers to cause infection (not likely, because these intakes are usually pretty low velocity.) 

3. The particles would have to make it through the ductwork and the filter, past your AC unit.

4. The particles would have to survive being heated if it's heating season (usually to about 90 degrees, beyond the virus' survivable range), or cooled (in cooling, water is wrung out of the air through the process of dehumidification. Not great if you're a viral particle that primarily moves via water droplets)

I'm not sure if you've had any stomach issues, but I suspect that mine might be part allergies and part cobblestone throat from acid reflux. Apparently the two sensations can be very similar. 

the start of allergy season coincided with the start of COVID isolation here, and for the first week or two I was a wreck. I think i really messed up my throat with some anxiety-induced acid reflux, and I'm still recovering. Some days there's an allergic component, but when that goes away, i think the sensation stays because of the throat damage. i've been staying away from acidy foods and i *think* it's helping? the internet says the acid-reflux version of cobblestone throat can take from 2 to 8 weeks to heal, so who knows?

My HA got the better of me. My stomach was going crazy and I was sure that every new symptom was the beginning of the end. I am doing much better now. Here is what I did:

* First things first, I took a break from all COVID-19 reading. That means no news, no googling symptoms, no COVID support forums, no scientific studies on treatments, etc.

* I reminded myself that anxiety and allergies can cause a lot of the symptoms I was feeling (nausea, itchy throat, headache, etc). 

* I started working through [these modules](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Health-Anxiety) by the australian government. These modules helped me to realize why I get so anxious, and helped me to logically shut down some of my irrational conclusions.

* I gave myself permission to feel shitty sometimes. Before, if i got a little fatigued in the afternoon, I'd start to melt down. ""Why am I tired? I'm not usually tired at 2pm! Something must be wrong!"" Really, I just worked hard that day, or i didn't sleep too well, or my allergy med caught up with me.
* I started the meditation practices in the modules that I linked. I am not a meditation kind of guy, but it made sense to me that an activity that increases my power to direct my attention will help me to not fixate on minor symptoms.

I hope this is helpful to you. I'm not cured - it's only been two weeks - but things are feeling much more manageable. My blood pressure has come back down to normal levels.

5. If you got your car, congrats!  You're done. 


*officially, this is the 4 second method, but people claim 3.2, 3.5, etc. Everyone has their own magic number."

Allergies,fmsn9em,t3_fx5dw4,1586358731.0,"It's been a tough allergy season. I usually get by with just Flucatisone nasal spray, but this year that hasn't been enough. I do Flucatisone (2 sprays per nostril) and a fexofenadine pill every morning. It does me OK til about 5, when my eye itch starts to come back and I get a bit sinusy.

Have you tried adding a nasal spray to your regimen? You could also swap the cetirizine for a different 2nd gen antihistamine too. I started out on loratadine and have had slightly better luck with fexofenadine.

The other things that help me are running a humidifier to keep the air around 45% RH and swapping the filter in your HVAC unit if you have a central system and have not done that yet this year."

Tips I found helpful:

* wait at the sawmill until you see the train coming before starting the TT

* you can edge all the way up to the front of the blue circle before starting

* the first section where you cut thru the wall and across the grass is make or break. don't let any of the rocks pop you airborne. You waste a lot of time floating.

* wheelie at every single slightly straight section. On curves, press forward.

* know exactly where you're gonna leave the train tracks

* practice turning in to the quarry against traffic a few times. Once you have that down, it's all traffic luck.

I know some people say it's way easy, but I had to do all of these things and still just barely made it. Maybe I just suck at racing though lol"

HealthAnxiety,fmol4y4,t3_fwj81t,1586262347.0,"This is 100% something anxiety is capable of. Consider a couple of things:

1. How credible is your initial hypothesis - that you may have diabetes because you were tired after eating? Are there other, more likely reasons why you might be tired? (Didn't sleep well, long day, it was late, allergies, etc)

2. When you focus on a specific symptom, it can make your experience of the symptom more intense, because you are paying close attention to every associated sensation. You may start to ask yourself ""is my throat always this dry?"" You don't necessarily have a good frame of reference because when you're not anxious about your throat, you don't even notice it.

3. You mentioned that you felt your mouth was dry. Did you drink more water than normal to try to counteract this sensation? Certainly that would cause you to pee a lot.

Consider these three ideas for a bit. Once you're done, go back to the initial question and ask yourself how likely you think it is that you actually have diabetes. If you're still pretty sure it's an issue, it might be time to talk to someone. If you dont think its very likely anymore, then congratulations! It was just anxiety and you have overcome it!"

Anxiety,fmm5o9m,t1_fmkndtf,1586199250.0,"Too late for last night, but maybe this will help you tonight:

I've been not eating snacks for 2h before bed, and putting away screens 1h before bed, and it's really helped. It's not foolproof though. Your brain can always introduce dumb, anxiety inducing questions right as you're settling down.

I've been using the ""dedicated worry time"" strategy. It always sounded silly until I realized that it's not as much about spending 30 minutes worrying every day as it is about building credibility with yourself that you really will revisit worries that you ""postpone"". That way when you're in bed and your brain is like ""heyyy, do you feel fatigued? That's a COVID symptom..."", you can go ""there's nothing I'm going to do about this now and I'll just lose sleep. I will worry about this at my next worry period"". Your body lets you calm down, and chances are you're not even feeling fatigued at your next worry period because you got some sleep."

HealthAnxiety,fmkybxv,t1_fmjt3yd,1586173172.0,"That sounds very similar to mine. I've been taking my usual allergy med (flucatisone) + an antihistamine as soon as I get up (fexofenadine). Lots of water and a glass or two of hot tea does a good job of thinning the mucus. I've heard guafenisin or pseudophedrine work too, but I don't have any at home right now. I've also found that running a humidifier to keep the air at 45% RH is very helpful. If I sleep with a humidifier at night, I wake up with no tickle, and it gradually comes back as I am exposed to pollen.

Again, I've had this for 3 weeks, coinciding with a really heavy pollen season. I don't think either of us have COVID 😊 check out pollen.com if you want to get an idea of how truly awful the tree pollen is right now. I bet it will set your mind at ease."

I had plans to get together with a couple of my best friends for the weekend, but those were obviously canceled due to COVID. Ive been through three weeks of it, but the isolation felt especially difficult yesterday.

What was helpful to me were the birthday messages from people. It reminded me how many people out there love me, care for me, and are thinking of me. I know I can't be with them now, but they will wait around for me.

I also did better when I reframed the situation. How wonderful to be home, to be healthy, to have food! I treated myself and my wife to homemade tacos, and we watched a show together. Who could really ask for more?

Another good birthday gift idea: no news for the whole day!"
