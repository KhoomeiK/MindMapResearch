my therapist was too busy to meet this month, we were on a weekly basis. 

the counselor I had last year told me she thought I had bipolar 2 but I've been diagnosis BPD by inpatient psych care in 2017. 

I've had hypomania before but never been diagnosed bipolar. 

the more time goes on the more I'm convinced it's bipolar 2. 

I don't have a psychiatrist right now just a general practitioner and idk if shell switch my meds or not. 

I've not been taking my meds the past couple weeks which is what I think trigger hypomania.

I adore my husband to the end of the earth, but if he leaves something in the 'wrong' spot I split and you would assume I was out for blood.
