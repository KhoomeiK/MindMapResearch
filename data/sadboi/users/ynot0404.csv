AskReddit,fpxl3bu,t3_gfqzac,1588984620.0,"Was in middle school concert band class when the lockdown alarm started blaring “this is not a drill, lockdown, lockdown, this is not a drill.” This was when the concert band (90-100 kids) and the orchestra (50-60) were all rehearsing in a giant concrete underground room together ranging from ages 12-15. It wasn’t chaotic, but maybe the most terror I’ve ever felt. The lights were off, I was packed into an instrument room with some 50 kids I didn’t know and it only got scarier. At one point, we all heard somebody scream and run down the hallway and it suddenly got really hushed in that room. Like, horrifyingly quiet besides the sounds of kids trying to muffle their crying. The footsteps stopped in front of our door, shook the handle for a second, and then kept running. Finally, after a good 45 minutes to an hour, a school janitor opened the door (which scared the fuck out of all of us) and said it was okay and we could leave. Turns out somebody robbed a store at gunpoint down the block and ran their ass onto our middle school field. I don’t know if I’ll ever be that scared again. Hope not."

AskReddit,fal91f5,t3_e9p6m2,1576180419.0,When I was a freshman in highschool there was a girl who I was kind of friends with but she had a huge crush on me so generally I didn’t spend a ton of time with her. Anyway one Christmas she got me an eggplant. That wasn’t the weirdest part of the gift though. Along with it came a semi-erotic calendar of the next year. It doesn’t stop there though. She had drawn on each of the pictures of the half naked women with a Sharpie. Each woman was defaced in their own way. It was very strange.

AskReddit,f68sntd,t3_dqlg6a,1572731346.0,I am part of the 1% of the world who sneezes 7+ times on average every day. I have what some people call solar sneezes (when I look at the sun in a certain way I’ll sneeze 9 out of 10 times) which I didn’t know until recently is actually hereditary. My dad has it too just not anywhere near as bad
