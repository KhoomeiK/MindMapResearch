Schaub is also delusional about Conors performance, Floyd toyed with him pure and simple, people paid big money for this exhibition so he gave them a fight. Nate is right, Floyd was not trying, he barely threw a punch first few rounds.

This rhetoric that Conor looked better than Alvarez or Paq is delusional, Floyd respected those guys..he didn't respect Conor. He literally let Conor punch him early on to tire him out, Floyd hasn't fought with a high guard for over 15 years, he didn't need fight defensive because he wasn't worried about Conors offense.

One that really gripes me is a few years ago he goes onto this rant about Ricky Gervais hosting the Golden Globes, whinging about how he had a bunch of writers help him out with the jokes. It wasn't just the once too, the next year Ricky did it he started whinging again, that one I can't find think it has been removed. He just comes across envious and bitter about Rickys success.

Why would Ricky need help writing a bunch of jokes ? The guy has written full feature length movie scripts, wrote music, performed in stand up comedy & is the co-creator of the biggest UK sitcom of all time.

Still a big fan of the guy, but he needs to tone it down a bit sometimes, he did a podcast with Theo and he was just so intense about everything...taking everything Theo says literally, like Rogan he doesn't seem to be able to jive with some other comedians.
