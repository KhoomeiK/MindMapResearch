knitting,fr0cv91,t3_glxh2y,1589791133.0,Beautifully even! A great first project 😊 my tip would be to make sure you check your tension by doing a gauge square (it will say on the pattern ‘so many stitches over so many rows to create a x by x inch square’ or something like that) and adjust needle size if you need to - I learned the hard way that tension really matters!
knitting,fqsnzw4,t3_gkoa0d,1589612923.0,I tend to work the last stitch and first stitch tighter then go back to my normal tension. It evens itself out when you continue your work and you block them (as long as you don’t do it too tight!)

But I do understand that everyone needs to do whatever they need to do to feel happy and comfortable with themselves so I try to just slide past it.

I’m doing a version of intermittent eating where I only eat between the hours of 12:00pm and 8:00pm. This doesn’t mean I eat whatever I want at any time, it just means I can feel in control. I only eat two meals and one snack a day and I drink plenty of water even out with those hours, and I definitely am feeling results. The thing I like best about the idea of intermittent eating is that you can adjust those hours to suit you. If you need to do 10:00-6:00 or 7:00-7:00 then go for it, but you still need to eat sensibly within whatever time frame you set. I have lost weight, but my biggest achievement is that I feel in control of my diet and am happy with it.

Yes, I did misinterpret, yes I did argue, but as you’ve clearly read through the comments you will see I consistently apologised and accept all advice given once it is understood that I am not hinging everything on my gerbils behaviour.

I do feel attacked when people say I am relying too much on my gerbils, especially when it’s strangers over the internet who do not have the full picture. I appreciate that you and this other commenter were trying to help and I have apologised both to you and them. You are currently the one perpetrating my defensiveness by continuing to attack my comments and, therefore, not being helpful. Perhaps you could practice what you preach and not be defensive yourself. 

The long and the shot of all of this is that, simply because this is the internet and there is no emotional context, every single person who reads this will interpret this in a different way. It is impossible to know the full meaning of anything said, and so sometimes altercations like this need to happen in order to gain a better understanding. 

Once more, I am sorry this has happened, and I’m sorry you feel I have been ignoring advice (despite the fact that some of it was advice I didn’t ask for). I hope you can understand my point of view too."

As I said, I am looking for advice on taming my gerbils, not help with my mental health. 

Perhaps I should not have written as much about that as I did, but it is there now and people have read it and responded so I don’t feel I can change it. I am handling the feedback fine, I’m simply asking you not to make assumptions about my mental state as you do not have the full picture.

I do not rely on my gerbils behaviour for my happiness, there are one or two particular situations where I find their responses very stressful and I am looking for advice on how to lessen this stress for both me and my gerbils. I do not like your implication of my impatience and ungrateful-ness. If you have any other useful tips on other ways of slowly gaining their trust I would be glad to hear them. Otherwise, please refrain from judgement."

You don’t actually know anything about my situation except what I have said above. I did not get my gerbils to ‘fix’ my mental health, I got them because I wanted companions, which they are. I am completely aware that they are prey animals and I know that I may not ever be able to pick them up or ‘cuddle’ with them. What I want is to make it easier on everyone when I need to move them in order to clean their tank or for them to get into a bigger space to stretch their legs and get some good exercise. At the moment it is very stressful because they are stressed and I am stressed and it’s not helping anyone.

What set up do you have? A pair of gerbils need a minimum of 20 gallons for their digging space, and if you can add a topper for them to run around in then that’s great, but not an absolute necessity.

As for handling, don’t force them to come to you or try to pick them up if they don’t want it, it will just stress them out. It can take a long time, but if you have patience and do things gradually you will be rewarded. Always start interactions by quietly speaking to your gerbils, then the first step is to offer them a treat from your flat hand. My two love pumpkin seeds, but there is a lot you can try with them. Once they are comfortable doing this, they may start to sit on your hand and eat. At this point you can slowly start to lift them a couple of cm at a time until they get used to it. Basically you’re gradually gaining their trust and as long as you don’t rush and stress them out then you’ll manage!"
