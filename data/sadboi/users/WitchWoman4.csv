Trust for anyone goes out the door. The fear of going out in public and being constantly paranoid. The constant questioning of EVERY SOCIAL SITUATION after it happens is very stressful. The guilt that it might of been your fault will eat you alive. Rape is the most horrible thing. It robs you of who you are. That is why it's  bad.
