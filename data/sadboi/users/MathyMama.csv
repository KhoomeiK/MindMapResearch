Parenting,fr145e3,t1_fr0r48w,1589812900.0,My pregnancy was more than 12 years ago so I don’t know how much has changed but I found it through online forums. Apparently it was close to a common morning sickness med given in other countries but not approved in US. I did a lot of reading and it seemed that the lack of approval was not a sound judgment.  It was reactionary because of the disastrous morning sickness pills from decades earlier. There is no relationship between the meds.
Parenting,fqzz79x,t3_glt1rf,1589779187.0,"(Hugs). This sucks. I had hyperemesis with my pregnancy and it was hell. Just remember you did your part by getting her where she can get some care. Now it’s up to the doctors and nurses to get her comfortable, and I’m sure they will treat her with extra care knowing she is pregnant and her partner can not be in the room with her. I know what it’s like to have that kind of “morning sickness” that LAUGHS at suggestions of crackers and ginger ale. Most people don’t know. And that’s good, I guess. I will tell you that unisom and vitamin b6 and occasional shots of b6 helped. And yeah getting Ivs when the dehydration became too much. Crazy as it sounds I got used to vomiting at one point and then slowly..,it lifted...and my second half of pregnancy was so so good. I felt better than I have ever felt. I hope you all turn a corner and experience that kind of relief too."

progresspics,fpsojmo,t3_gf8hpm,1588876955.0,Oh dear. I know what this sub is but sometimes these posts really kick me in the head. Weight loss is not in and of itself something to celebrate. Sometimes people have a positive changed relationship with food or their body image or exercise and they want to post here in celebration of the ways their body and face now reflect that. And that can be so lovely. But goddamnit there is too much judgment around weight and I too have received compliments on my appearance while literally starving from grief and stress. I don’t wish you anything but better days ahead.  ❤️

The young age and sexual content is just...predatory and awful. In our case there was a bit of an escalation beyond texting. Sadly after this our kid had a major meltdown and spent 9 days in a pediatric psych unit due to suicide threats (we went to the emergency room when she said she meant to kill her self). I’m so sorry you’re going through this hell. We reported the graphic exchanges when our kid told us what was happening— she was being “sextorted”— and they (officers) came to the house, took all the Instagram info and login info and they are trying to track the creep down. I haven’t had any updates in several weeks. My kids doing better but yeah please take the suicide threat seriously. Even if you don’t go to the ER, I recommend you lock up knives and medicine. We got some big tool boxes and simple locks- much cheaper than “lock boxes” online.

oneanddone,fmwb9sh,t3_fxs4wk,1586443355.0,"My daughter is 12. 

She complains often about being an only, even still often begging for a sibling. She’s the only “only” she knows. 

She was a sort of “perfect” kiddo until this year and holy hell have we had problems. Primarily because her picky eating turned into a full blown eating disorder and her gifted ness/skipping a grade led to some very poor decision making (without getting into details). I can see how being an only has probably fueled some of her worst qualities. But I know that my husband and I did not have the mental/physical/financial means of raising another. The thought still leaves me absolutely exhausted. 

Family has given up- but wow they really pushed for years for her to have a sibling. But none of them were even in the same state, couldn’t ever provide any help whatsoever, so they get it. 

Best parts are financial and overall volume/energy in the house. I am a quiet person and prefer calm and quiet. Also we can support her and others because we aren’t paying huge amounts of money toward another child. 

Worst part is still wondering how having a sibling could have benefited my girl. I have siblings and we have had our times of troubles (even years without speaking...we had rough childhoods and all turned out pretty difficult). I get that siblings are no guarantees of any sort (playmate, confidante, help with older parents, etc). But I think our daughter would have been a bit better off without undivided attention and with someone else in the house. My husband and I are quite a bit alike, I think having a fellow kid in the house would have been a good thing for her. 

Eh, I still occasionally got baby fever until maybe 2-3 years ago. I have a “well maybe that wasn’t a perfect decision but also I couldn’t have handled another two year old AT ALL” kind of mentality. Some years are easier (oh, 6-10, what glorious years!!!) and some are harder but at least I feel good about each stage being our last of that particular thing. I hope to be a great grandparent should my kid want children. But it’s ok if not."

ARFID,fk6utgl,t3_fgqp7v,1583917131.0,Thank you so much for sharing. My daughter is struggling with ARFID (and anorexia and anxiety and depression). Her treatment team at the partial hospitalization eating program actually perpetuated this “it’s indulgent/willful” mentality. Their way to help was tough love- don’t eat the vegetables? No TV.  I thought that was just bizarre. They had no compassion for her struggling and she herself didn’t have the capacity to express it as you have here. We are seeking another support system because we hate that they wanted us to view her as picky/indulgent when it is so clearly not that.

She’s on meds but I don’t know if they’re helping. We go to lots of different therapies but nothing has helped much. She’s so so so sad and so different from the kid I knew this time last year. Her dad and I have essentially had the same thoughts...we used to think we were pretty good parents and now feel like it’s all been a complete failure.

Being in gymnastics is not ideal for ED recovery given the focus on physical appearance...we have also just enrolled her in a horse riding therapy program. My hope is it helps her connect to her body without all of the baggage of gymnastics. She currently does gymnastics once a week, limited (very little) workout at home. She had been working something like 12 hours a week at the gym and maybe 10+ more per week at home.

EatingDisorders,fgsqp19,t1_fgsogea,1581090610.0,"My daughter was in a partial hospitalization program. She had gone from many many hours of gymnastics (along with this secret monster AN) to being in a totally different environment. We were living at a Ronald McDonald House, so we were away from the gymnastics equipment for a long time. As she became weight restored and feeling better, the therapists approved a return. Her coach is VERY in tune with the situation and also monitoring everything with us very carefully. Her dieticians adapted her daily meal plan to allow for a certain number of hours a week, and she knows she has to maintain in order to continue. For her the complete drop off in physical activity was necessary but also very hard emotionally..,I’m trying to balance wanting her to stay connected to activities and people she love and feeling GOOD in her body versus any possible triggers and return to disordered eating and exercise."

For many weeks she was so upset and out of sorts that all she’d do was sulk and grump, watching tv with headphones on was her preferred activity. But things have improved a bit now and we try to do things together several nights a week and have been able to slowly introduce some exercise (she’s in gymnastics) but with appropriate measures taken in her new plan. I’m so sorry I know it’s hard. I was gobsmacked going from an “easy” kid (she’s 11) to one who needed near constant monitoring,engagement, redirection, etc."
CancerFamilySupport,fgnjw56,t3_eza9wm,1580946396.0,"My niece was diagnosed  at age 4with neuroblastoma last fall, also presenting with a large abdominal mass. I’m not going to sugar coat it, it’s hard.  I saw her during her first round of chemo, while the tumor itself was causing so much pain and the chemo was making her miserable. It was the hardest thing ever. But let me give you some of the good news- in her case, the tumor responded very well to chemo and so when she had her surgery a few weeks ago it was MUCH smaller. So even though going through chemo is hell...there is a ray of light that maybe it will be able to attack the tumor successfully. Hers was borderline high/intermediate risk, no evidence of cancer in bone marrow, no MYCN amplification.

SOAR has also helped me so much. The audiobook is great because then you can put it on and listen any time you need soothing. And hey listening to music can be good for anybody and is a decent tip. But my most recent flight had some pretty bumpy turbulence and instead of trying to distract myself from it or push it out of mind I really focused on it. Tried to notice all the movements and then sort of marvel at how strong and awesome the plane was, to travel huge distances at great speeds and manage these bumps with NO PROBLEM. And it helped because I realized that things weren’t ACTUALLY moving much. I did not feel fear even though I would have previously. Good luck I hope you have a great flight, no matter what!"

calculus,f8k5klj,t3_e0zcxy,1574607678.0,"you’re asked for tangent lines. To give an equation of a line you can use two things - a point and a slope. For these problems you will get the POINT by plugging x value into the original function. That gives you something like (1,f(1)) if we are looking for the tangent line at 1. Let’s pretend that came out to be (1,3). 

Then you need to take the derivative of the function and plug in 1 to get the slope. So if you find f’(x) and PLUG IN 1 to that and you have your slope. Let’s pretend that came out to be 5. 

Now use point-slope formula for a line. With our made- up numbers from above that is :

y-3=5(x-1). 

That is usually rewritten so it is y=5x-2."

Then when you work out a problem try to “what if?” it a bit...what is it about this problem that could be changed a bit, would you still be able to solve it? How would it be different? When students really dig in on what’s happening with a type of question rather than just getting to that one answer, it bodes very well for their preparation for exams and such. Also, bring a nice and fairly positive attitude. Goes a long way, we are all just human and prefer to be around and work with people who are easy to talk to."

I’m in the middle of a different but similar situation. My 4 year old niece was very recently diagnosed with cancer. I quickly flew out to them (very far away), to help with the first round of chemo. What I saw broke my heart. I cannot even describe. 
Yet. I teach math at a small college and our classes start Monday. I have to finish getting everything ready tomorrow.  


Here are a few strategies I’ve used:
-Meditation (Kristin Neff has some very good ones in the app Insight Timer) 
-Reaching out and getting help when possible. I’ve told so many people - even strangers- about what is happening. It’s hard to explain how much people will support and love their fellow humans when they see them truly suffering. Kindness is the BEST medicine. 
-Speaking of medicine- Xanax. Just a little bit. Just to stop the shaking. It’s short term (habit forming and all...) but there are possibly other options too (that’s -just what I had)
-Counseling - I’ve had two meetings with my counselor since this started, and each time has helped so much. 
-Timing- put a time limit on the grief to some extent. When you have to be in work mode then close the lid on the grief for just awhile. Give yourself permission to be safe and productive. 

I wish you the best. Your grief is important. So is your work. Balancing both will be a test of your lifetime but I have faith in you."

It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. If my sister was holding up better it would not be so bad but she’s not. I left knowing I gave love and comfort as much as I could for a few days. And now I know a little more about their day to day needs. But wow going out there in such a heightened state and then seeing everything I saw...I’m focusing on getting myself pulled together ASAP
CancerFamilySupport,eydqweh,t3_cwq6kf,1567023402.0,I’m so sorry to hear this. I hope your dad gets some very good care and that you all have some practical support where it is needed. And emotional support too. Remember that your own emotions might be very difficult and you should pay attention to your needs even as you are focused on your dad. Best of wishes to you all.

Parenting,ewpwno0,t3_cpi5av,1565651105.0,"My daughter had some odd ticks at around age 3. It was scary! She seemed to have trouble speaking and sort of stared off and just did things that weren’t normal for her. I was so worried. We got her checked out, even an EEG. Nothing evident. And...it all just went away. Took a few months but she has no memory of any of it and even I forget, except when I see others sharing stories like yours. I have no idea what is happening in your particular case but just wanted you to know that it actually could be temporary."

raisedbynarcissists,ew6jij5,t3_cn028x,1565172577.0,"I don’t understand some of these comparisons. Physics abuse IS emotionally abusive too. And most often, verbally abusive as well. That doesn’t mean it’s not abuse if it is emotional/verbal without the physical side—- it is and it is terrible. And I’m so sorry you experienced it. 

But people in this thread seem to be isolating physical abuse as its own thing and I assure it is emotionally traumatizing to be attacked and hurt by someone you trust."
Parenting,ew6ipca,t3_cn1xo1,1565171477.0,There are ways in which having 1 is HARDER. So please don’t feel like your experience is invalidated. I am fortunate to have friends with a range of numbers of kids (some none). Unless you think of children as a pure burden there’s no reason to constantly say more = harder life. But even I have to admit feeling jealous of some things that seem so easy for my friends without kids. But because I’m NOT a jerk I would never say “at least you don’t have kids!”

scoliosis,ev0m69w,t3_chyk6e,1564141852.0,"My daughter is 11. Hers was caught just before she turned 10, in the same way. It turned out she had anS curve, both in 20’s. She’s been in a brace with little change, even though she’s grown about 6 inches since then! I was so so worried and sad at first. I still don’t know if she will ever need surgery but that was my biggest fear. However I joined a few online (Facebook) groups and saw lots of kids who had/didn’t have surgery and they were doing GREAT. It made me realize that even if my big fears came true we would be ok. But word of advice: please stick to research backed approaches for intervention. There are lots of “snake oil” types out there trying to make $ by offering easier solutions...but they aren’t solutions. 
Also for what it’s worth my daughter got serious in gymnastics AFTER the diagnosis and it’s been fine! Well she broke her ankle this week but that was unrelated to the scoliosis! Just bad luck. Lol."

fearofflying,etudb8w,t3_cdjq2c,1563209980.0,"Oh, I’m so sorry for these feelings you’re having. I do understand. I’ve flown quite a bit but my anxiety got much worse after some bumpy flights last summer. I did a few things in preparation for a cross country (USA) flight I had a couple weeks ago and perhaps they will help you. First, I got the audiobook “SOAR” and tried those exercises. They might have helped but the biggest benefit of this was when I was going through some turbulence on the flight and put on the chapter about turbulence and the CALM and assuring confidence of the pilot explaining it was SO helpful! Second, I got Xanax. But I do not believe it helped me very much on my first fight. So for my second flight I took Dramamine (max suggested dose) and it helped more! I was sleepy and able to actually sleep away a few hours of the flight. Third, I made sure my travel companion knew what I was going through. She is a fantastic friend and frequent flier and isn’t scared of flying. Having her every so often reassure me helped a lot. I would say “oh it’s been bumpy” and she would say “oh I didn’t notic anything” and it reminded me that it is MY OWN mind that makes even light turbulence a problem. Then when we went through some very bumpy clouds she was going “oh yeah that was a big one!. “ but she wasn’t really nervous. My husband is also not scared of flying but he isn’t as good at giving me assurances, flying with someone who checks in with you is good. 
For what it is worth, There have been several bits of news lately about bad flights. I think even when you don’t seek out that kind of news it can really sneak in your mind and get you rattled. But having a boring old regular flight will be a good reminder that that is typical."
AskWomen,etm373a,t1_etl80rs,1562951054.0,"Whoa I had this too. But the docs said it was ectopic (after my second trip to ER for CRAZY BAD pain within days of an early detection positive pregnancy test). During the surgery they saw/laser blasted cysts and some endometriosis and pulled something out of my Fallopian tube and told me the pregnancy was over. Then after the followup bloodwork they went “whoopsadaisy”. Never was an ectopic, just too early to show up in the uterus via ultrasound."

learnmath,esxdygg,t3_c9f5fp,1562329216.0,"f changed its input by multiplying that input by 3 then adding 1. How could you undo those steps to get back to the original input? First you’d have to SUBTRACT 1, since adding 1 was the last step and you’re rewinding. Then you’d DIVIDE by 3 since that’s how you undo multiplying by 3. In function language we can take those two steps and write them as an input/output rule. g(x)=(x-1)/3. See how that starts with an x, subtracts 1, then divides that result by 3? Others have pointed out the algorithm that helps you get that result quickly."
