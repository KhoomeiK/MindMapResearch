depression,fr04zqu,t3_glvcff,1589783920.0,"To be clear you don't have to dump onto your psychologist all at once. Consider what you want to accomplish in your sessions with your doctor. Never lie to the one you expect to help you, but you can choose what/when to share. Psych wards are not what Hollywood depicts nor is it like it was 20 years ago. Just like you wouldn't be sent to the operating room for an amputation because you have a cold, they're not going to medically get you stoned and fit with a straight jacket because you're depressed and have suicidal thoughts."
depression,fr03tiy,t1_fqzzuse,1589782910.0,Getting help should not be viewed as a bad thing. This is coming from someone who was hospitalized for depression and suicidal ideation.
depression,fr03pg6,t3_glvcff,1589782815.0,"I would suggest you be honest with your psychologist. 

Some background on me: I'm 34 M and have been depressed since age 12 when my mother passed away from complications with Lupus. My only suicide attempt was right before I joined the army at 21. At 29 (8 years after my only combat deployment)I had my worst moment in my depression and was taken to see a psychologist and was completely honest with her. I did a week in a psych ward with group therapy, rubber pencils, and little to no outside stimulus. I told her about my current suicide plan and my unwillingness to put it into action as that would immeasurably hurt my wife and siblings (I'm a suicide risk, but not one). I have since been medically retired from the army and am working part time.

Being hospitalized for your depression should never be viewed as a bad thing. If you need help get help! If you are not honest with your doctor how on earth can you expect them to help you?

Edit: hospitalization is to help get you away from potential stressors and provide you with a safe environment to get you back on your feet. The loss of some freedoms does suck, but it's temporary and again this would be to get you back on your feet. Get yourself to a stable point. If that should requires hospitalization then you should embrace it as a new chapter in your life. It is a means to an end not the solution."

depression,fqzlj0e,t3_glka4u,1589769878.0,"The problem I have is that all my social interactions are mimicry and learned by rote. Social interactions have never come naturally and require a large amount of emotional energy to maintain. I'm 34 and it's taken me 20 years to realize that maintaining the socially normative mask and working a normal 40 hour per week schedule is impossible for me. I got through most of those years with people thinking I was just a little weird. It took me being hospitalized and some therapy to realize that mask was not normal.  Up until then, I thought that everyone was like this and just hid it better than me. I guess I was somewhat lucky that my hospitalization got me medically retired from the army and I don't have to work full time anymore. 

I no longer feel most emotions and anything I display in public are to maintain appearances. It's all just so exhausting."

5Gdidit,fqy8279,t1_fqh21m1,1589744192.0,"I saw an interesting article on r/philosophy a while back on the personality traits of hard-core conspiracy theorists. IIRC it boiled down to a couple of points: 

1. The desire to posses unique knowledge outside of what is common knowledge becomes an integral part of their identity. So any attack on their cherished theory is taken as a personal attack. 

2. Their methodology is not actually based in logic and facts. The theory, is to them, a fact as it is an essential part of their identity. So any leaps or missteps in logic are brushed aside because the theory to them is true first and foremost. 

These to aspects in my opinion make it impossible to have any meaningful discussion with the hard-core conspiracy theorists. They can't conceded anything because in their eyes it would invalidate aspects of their identity."
