Also, despite being a multi-billion dollar corporation, he had all his fighters fly publicly to get to the arena. In hindsight, this was a reckless decision as at least 3 members of the card were flying with the virus. And again, he forced literally every single person involved with UFC 249 to sign non-disclosure agreements barring them from even speaking about the protocols in place. So we cannot point to the UFC as an example of a sporting event done correctly in the midst of this pandemic, as those who were involved with the event are unable to speak on it. 

One thing the UFC did decently, in my opinion, was ensure that only 4 teams maximum were allowed in the arena at a time. 2 fighters and their corners in the octagon and 2 other fighters and their corners were warming up in the locker room. After each fight they'd rotate and bring 2 more teams over from the hotel. This can't be done in the NBA.
