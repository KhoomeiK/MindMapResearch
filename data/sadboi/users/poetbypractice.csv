todayilearned,ertj1yf,t1_erthai8,1561243829.0,"I agree, and I’d love if we could put more focus on promotion and availability of preventative care.  Ultimately it would also save our system money, since those regular visits lead to less expensive medical interventions and of course save lives."
todayilearned,ert46xl,t1_erszumm,1561231980.0,"I’m not saying we shouldn’t do that, and personally I’d love to cut our military spending at least in half, but I do think we need to put the work in up front and be thinking about what we want that system to look like.  

I don’t like the idea of just throwing money at the coverage problem, personally, and I would like to advocate for doing more."
todayilearned,ert3yx0,t1_ert0dz0,1561231804.0,"I would agree, if that is what I was arguing I wouldn’t blame you for not taking me seriously.  What I am saying is that offering coverage to people who have previously had none is likely to significantly increase the rate of regular health checkups, attending treatment centers for substance use, seeking counseling, and other more mundane and regular services which are already grossly underfunded at community levels in low income areas around the country.  

I am not talking about going to see surgeons for bypass necessarily, and in those instances I do believe that people in general deserve to live and have a right to healthcare, and I would never begrudge someone the feelings of wanting to help that person.  

My problem is simply that “marking sure everyone is covered” without also addressing systemic issues in healthcare from the provider side is likely to lead to different, less foreseen problems that we have an opportunity to talk about and maybe address preemptively."
todayilearned,ert094t,t1_erszl58,1561228905.0,"So here’s the thing about that statistic, not all people who are insured use healthcare the same amount.  It doesn’t really matter that “only 10%” are uninsured, since that is still a massive raw number of people, and likely not evenly distributed throughout the country, meaning poorer areas with fewer resources would likely bear the majority of that load.  

Again, I am not saying it shouldn’t happen, and I do think that healthcare should be a human right for all people, I am just concerned about making sure that the right to healthcare is the right to quality treatment, which in my opinion is already not as good as it could be in this country."
todayilearned,erszg5c,t1_erst0sn,1561228278.0,"We would need many, many more hospitals, clinics, mental health centers, detoxes, and treatment facilities, and the increase in workload would certainly lead to a decrease in quality of care and a major increase in burnout, both in the short term.  

Don’t get me wrong, I agree with the goal, but selling it as this simple seems a little misleading or uninformed."
fo76,er6dtvq,t3_c0kkz9,1560545496.0,"Since this is tied to monetizing, what if there was a way to pay atoms to export your character’s clothes to BR?  I know I would love to play as my beerhat-and-straightjacket-and-welding-goggles crazy hill man, myself, and I’d probably pay 250-350 atoms per item to make them available in BR.  Alternatively I would pay ~500 atoms to make the whole thing an “outfit” that I can’t edit further.  
This type of interface could be housed in a machine in one of the vaults, and might also create a “clothing economy” in adventure mode for rare clothing items.  
I think it would be fun, anyway."
