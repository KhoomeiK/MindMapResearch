I assumed my SO had gotten home early from work and called out to him. A man answered me in a foreign language. I realized then that a stranger must have crawled in through the window in the room he was in. I started screaming at him to get out of my house and that I had the police on the phone. I could hear him desperately trying to get back out the window as I could hear the blinds on the window banging frantically. I didnt dare enter the room because I wasn't sure if he had a weapon or not. When the noise died down and I was able to enter the room, I saw that he had just absolutely torn it apart, but hadn't taken anything that I could see. The police said that he had probably been watching me so when I would leave and I had disturbed him too early for him to find and take anything of value. 

I was terrified and couldn't sleep for the next few days. The police also said that it was likely that he would come back now that he knew he could easily access that window. I put a brand new lock on it right away, but it still took a while for me to feel comfortable leaving the house again."

I was living with a roommate I hated, my mental health was declining rapidly, and I had been sexually assaulted. My best friend, who had been my roommate the previous year, was there for me in every way. She literally saved my life. The memory I think of is how when I started to be afraid of being alone because it would just be me and my thoughts, my friend would show up at my apartment and sleep in my little tiny single bed with me. I never had to ask, she just did it. 

The next year, I was living with her again and was much happier, but I developed gallbladder problems and was hospitalized at one point. The first night I went into the hospital, I had to be kept over night. They put me in a room and my friend insisted on staying the night with me so I wouldn't be alone and afraid. I offered to let her to sleep in the hospital bed with me but she refused and instead, slept on the floor. I woke up in the morning to see my parents taking her out for breakfast. 

Thinking that I have a friend who just genuinely cares about my well being and loves me for who I am makes me smile. Knowing that someone cared so much that they made themselves uncomfortable just so that I wouldn't be alone makes me feel truly lucky. She is a wonderful friend and although we live far apart now, I still love her very much!"

Anxiety,fl1dnus,t3_flvow6,1584726934.0,"Yep and there's an evolutionary reason for it. It's part of the fight or flight response. Constant anxiety means that you are also perpetually in fight or flight mode. This causes short term processes in your body, such as the digestive system, to kind of become paused. It's so that if there is danger, our body isn't slowed down so much that we can't escape. It can also affect memory, the reproductive system and the part of your brain that regulates sleep. It's supposed to be a short term solution to danger and as soon as we are cleared of whatever percieved danger there is, the processes can begin again with no trouble. The issue is that with constant anxiety, our bodies aren't equipped to deal with the prolonged pausing of these bodily functions and so, strange things begin to happen such as digestive issues or insomnia."

Edit: Oh wow! Thank you so much for the awards! You've made my day! I'm going to treat myself and my doggo to a nice long walk and then a snack at the store!"

Nepotism was so bad prior to the introduction of the regulations that teachers who were just as qualified, had the same experience and frankly, might have done a better job were left to languish on the supply list for YEARS. There was no justifiable way that this was fair. Eliminating the current hiring practices would send us back to this time and would make teaching in Ontario unattractive. We would lose out on great educators simply because our hiring practices weren't fair. I dont want to see us go back to that."
