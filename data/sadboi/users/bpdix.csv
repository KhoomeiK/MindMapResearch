im a xayah main (675k lol)

what you do it both take W first, xayah and rakans level 1 and 2 are very good, wait for the enemy to walk up and rakan W‚Äôs them and you need to be ready, if hes your duo there should be communication anyway, then W and you guys both can just run them down with the attack speed and your +20%, level 2 both take E and do the same thing but now you can root

i actually dont play with very many rakans now, its a lot of the other supports like nautilus, pyke, and my usual duo plays mostly taric but also leona/rakan sometimes, i always struggle with caitlyn lucian ezreal (cait can just stand behind caster minions and be harder to jump on, and ez and lucian and E the rakan W) and like morgana is hard, rakan actually can counter the hook champs bc he can tank the hook and E back to you (some situations its better/easier to do than others)"
