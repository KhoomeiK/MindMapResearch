She waxed on about them as heroic, stoic, and lovers of children instead of acknowledging their creation and use as a pit fighting dog, and so she coined the term ""nanny dog"" somewhere around the 1970s.

No dog was ever created to watch over children, that is hogwash.

Nor can you say staffies aren't aggressive, as they lead the way in severe and fatal maulings on both people and pets on the UK.

If he attacks her, you remove him from the situation and ignore him. Either outside or crated until he calms down. Every. Single. Time. Until he stops.


Consult a vet for meds - doggy Prozac or Xanax may be in order.


Your dog is terrorizing you as much as your other dog."
reactivedogs,fp61x8c,t3_gbfd20,1588344518.0,"My dog once rushed up to a lab when my back was turned that came up out of nowhere like 200 yards away. I heard the guy yell ""Hey!"" and I turned around and saw my dog and yelled his name. He slammed on his brakes five feet from the dog, turned around, and came right back to me to lay at my feet. He was a HUGE dog friendly fella, but still.


If your dogs recall isn't that bombproof, don't let them offlead. Fucks sake."

Hypocrites. They can wax on about hating chihuahuas and doodles all day but not precious, mauly waulie Paulie the pitty. 😒"

LifeProTips,fp60ghr,t3_gbf20y,1588343705.0,"Im stuck between being the helper and not. Like my last relationship all I did was save the dude after the first year, I let him drain me for 3 years. Now I'm two years into a relationship and I never ask for help, but nor do I help because I have a deeply ingrained fear of being burned again.

It's a conundrum."

BanPitBulls,fp5vojz,t3_gbc5iy,1588340926.0,"It would if it were a pit bull.

That's a presa canario."
BanPitBulls,fp5vl3h,t1_fp5bivi,1588340869.0,"No, it isn't. The main reason dogs have issues is from breeding dogs with poor structure, poor temperament, or any genetic diseases common within the breed, which are easily tested for if you're not a BYB piece of shit. All of the above are hereditary and thus express themselves when carriers of the trait are bred."
