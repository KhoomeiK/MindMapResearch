SuicideWatch,ffq331e,t1_ffq2ty6,1580117724.0,"Seriously considering deleting this because Jesus it’s truly atrocious. What’s ironic is I came on the suicide thread to post about wanting to kill myself. But I won’t do it. And neither will you. If you’re getting close message me because I have more to say, even if it doesn’t change your mind why not have a quick read"
SuicideWatch,ffq2ty6,t3_eui2mn,1580117320.0,"Life is reallllyyyyyyyyy shit. Suicide is awfully appealing to me most days, but deep deep deep down i think for some reason it will leave me in a worse place than I am in now, and as much as I could not give a flying fuck about myself, it leaves me weary. You wouldn’t be simply gone, you’d be stuck.

If youre so sad that you feel worthless and don’t care about the effect it will have on others, get into drugs. Why kill the void when you can temporarily over fill it. This is terrible advice because you’ll be worse off at the end then when you started. But why not experience those high highs if you intend on cutting yourself short anyway? You’ll slowly kill yourself or end up finding value for your life before drugs. 

If your life is so worthless, go be wreckless and waste it away. Don’t just straight end it. If your response to this is wtf I don’t want to be a methhead, then you have some self worth + people in your life you shouldn’t disappoint. 

Or just ride it out like the rest of us."
MDMA,fcx6tfx,t3_ej9fky,1578053605.0,"Did 1.5 over 3 days last year and hoh never again. 5HTP and gingko are most definitely your friend, good luck!"
Drugs,fcx6mt6,t3_eitdlp,1578053395.0,"Hey I did 1.5g over 3 days this time last year, disgusting place to be in, sorry you’re going through it. I know everyone comments healthy diet but truly that’s where you’ll get your sound mind back. Eat consistent high nutrient dense food that will give your body the correct vitamins to rebuild the damage is the way to go and certainly helped me. I had depression, derealization and anxiety around 4-5 months post my binge. Now a year later on I’m better than ever but I worked hardd on my health last year. On top of mostly plant based (lol i know) I took gingko (cognitive function helper), magnesium, b vitamins, ashwaganda (reduces anxiety attacks) and omegas to help out my brain, best of luck!!!"
