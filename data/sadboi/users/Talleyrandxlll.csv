Qigong classes and physical therapy seem to be a better place to deal w/ trauma than a yoga class.

I’ve given you examples why you should not be so close-minded. I’m sorry I’m not given you exact situations. I hate spelling things out for people I encourage people just to be less prejudice. 

Ok... I didn’t say validation through others was bad. I stated that some may consider it cheating. Some may consider talking to others as cheating. What if you just need someone to talk to and your partner refuses to talk about the things you want to? Is this person terrible for talking about things to others?

Sex is easy to define as cheating. Let’s suppose sex isn’t as intimate as a long talk to some people. Does this make the conversations more or less like cheating? Does this make sex more or less cheating?

[Here’s ](https://youtu.be/H564Dmsksz0) a 5 min YT link. I can’t think of a good way to sum it up but I’ll try...

Similar to disassociative identity disorders but instead of going to another identity we go to a numbness where things aren’t recognizable. Many people have a feeling of being out of body or alien.

It is largely caused by many triggers including anxiety, trauma, pain, immersion, and chemical use.

[Here’s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6964445/) a sterile, long-winded version as well."
Psychic,fpi3zli,t3_gdexfu,1588633207.0,"I have an old pup. If she stops eating then treat her to a bit of gravy. Gravy over something or just gravy to start. A brown gravy or one high in fat. 

It also could be gas/bloating. Eggs can cause that so they might be avoiding them if he’s got some poops."
dpdr,fpi3348,t1_fpi1lnr,1588632703.0,"That is awesome! I love my aspy friends. I’ve had friends in their 20’s, 30’s, and 40’s that just found out they were aspies or autistic. I have found so much in common with them with my ADHD among other things. I have found them to be some of the most genuine and authentic people around. 

I am/have ADHD/empath/dyslexia/ptsd/depression/dpdr/hsp/etc... I only knew about the ADHD and dyslexia until August of last year. I always felt like an alien until I found that I had people everywhere that shared my reality.

Well, I appreciate your cousins or w/e for knocking’ boots. <3"

Fantastic, thank you!!"
Depersonalization,fpi1fxo,t3_gdl02s,1588631787.0,"It’s almost entirely nerve related in my experience with panic attacks. I’ve shared [this YT link](https://youtu.be/cEOS2zoyQw4) a lot here bc it was a gateway into me regaining control. I haven’t had a single attack since.

Rise above the anxiety and fear. See it but pat it on the head bc you are above it. See your worries as a balloon with the worry’s name on it and watch it float away while you smile and say goodbye to it.

I’ve been there with suicide and it’s never worth it. Patience gave me chances to conquer this and I am. Now I’m using it to be an even better person than I was before dpdr."

Was there a shift in your personality at all?"
ADHD,fphzy65,t1_fphz6ue,1588630961.0,"You’re definitely right, finding something that works and you’re still you is a blessing; especially if it lasts. 

You can go through my history on here and see what happens when meds go wrong. It’s brutal...

It’s sneaky, too. Some of the make us feel great for a period of time while the dopamine/serotonin levels aren’t high. Then the levels drop off and you get grumpy and dependent on the meds to squeeze the last bit of dopamine/serotonin out."

ADHD,fphyw5k,t1_fphxom9,1588630386.0,"I just screen shotted this to remind me to look into this further. 

I have had good results from a holistic approach through B12 MTH among other supplements. I haven’t seen any liver or blood pressure issues, either.

The problem with holistic is that you kinda need to trial and error as well as do a lot of research. The upside is it feels more natural and I don’t seem to change into a different person from holistic remedies."

Ritalin and it would make me sweat gel out of my pores. 

Adderall damages my liver and anger

Vyvanse made me irritable and also did something to my liver enzymes (I don’t remember bc it was a decade or so ago)

I haven’t  tried concerta, though

I’m not one of those people that want to poopoo everything but I am sensitive to stuff. Are there other options? I also found daily mindfulness exercises that helped a lot but it takes discipline which I don’t have some days."
