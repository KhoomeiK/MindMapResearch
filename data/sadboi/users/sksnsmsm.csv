I too desire the truth alone but I think by definition ultimate metaphysical truth is impossible to grasp, since there always exists a possibility of a layer above. Whatever it is, it is. Thing is, if you’re right about going to hell unless accepting god....maybe it is a good idea to just hit the agree button out of caution. IF that were the case, you’d have to agree with me that we live in a barbaric reality.

But you didn’t answer my question about a gangster having the same capacity for moral agency. It’s impossible everyone has equal free will so it’s not a fair playing field. Some are destined to lead “worse” lives"
conspiracy,fno07yb,t1_fnkged7,1587107404.0,"There’s so many holes with this mindset. Does a gangbanger who grew up destined for a life of crime and violence really have as much moral agency as you? Yeah ok. It’s impressive you actually believe this. A human being physically dying equates to the rest of humanity being “saved”. LOL what, you think we live in Harry Potter universe? Shit is so cringey and dramatic. You need help man. One day you might realize the absurdity of it all. Even if you were 100% correct there’s no way to prove that your own god isn’t a simulation created by a higher being, and so on.

And we need to divide because we only experience our point of view from a slice.


And I basically meant it’s impossible to know the full truth while in our current ego and memory. So...we’ll never know, or can never know for certain wtf is going on. It doesn’t make sense to say “it’s just you either way” cause realistically we can only experience our current perception. If we are to aliens what Sims characters are,...that’s all we are. Being part of the “one” changes nothing.

If we are living in a fucked up experiment...then...welp...not a good dream.


Also not trying to pick at you, I’m super interested in this topic, more so than anything else so it’s nice to see someone talk about it for once.

It does seem absurd to think we are 100% evolution and random chance. That would make all this utterly meaningless and I’d accept that it’s all a shitty predetermined fate. On the other hand, if the immaterial exists (which I sorta believe), then it would be hard to explain the shithole of reality that we suffer in. So many abjectly horrible existences on earth discount the possibility of benevolent ruling spirits. Ultimately I think the possibility of us humans living in a westworld-esque zoo for more advanced beings (or even spirits) is in the realm of possibility. I could honestly accept being some aliens fucked video game....it would explain a lot and I’d finally be able to cave in to fate"

I guess it’s up to a matter of belief but spirit has never been substantively demonstrated in our material universe. Belief in Jesus etc is just trying to be loving r whatever. That doesn’t mean god exists as a real phenomenon. Not trying to bash because I wish the immaterial realm was confirmed but it’s just speculative and subjective"

I’ve had some bizarre manic hallucinations too. I was watching a movie once and when I glanced at it I saw green drapes/wall they use for special effects instead of the CGI that was supposed to be there. I swear I saw it for a second and it made no sense. I want to say there is much more to bipolar/schizophrenia than what’s medically stated. Who knows, safer to disregard it all though. I hate this shit. My brain feels broken as hell too. I can’t concentrate on anything...such low energy and motivation"

The sensation was so bizarre. I’ve always wanted a real life matrix breaking moment and this definitely qualifies. It goes against laws of nature honestly. That’s really interesting you saw a color. How did it manifest? Like a light or more like a fabric? Also do you feel like during these manic episodes you become more connected to another realm? Like maybe something outside our human matrix that tries to communicate with us? I get other things to like synchronicities but mainly seeing repeating numbers far more frequently in manic episodes.

Overall though bipolar has been very destructive to my life and I wished I didn’t have it."
