At first I thought it would be better if they knew, so I told a few of my ex girlfriends, and a few friends but limited number at first to gauge reaction. Let's just say it didn't go well. Each girlfriend I told ended up breaking up with me or cheated on me within months of me telling them. All the friends I told are no longer my friends except one. This was over 20 years ago now. 

So i internalized it. For decades. My family still doesn't know.

I've just now this year finally reached a place where I feel like I can open up again. But, as before it has not gone smoothly. I can understand why. My current girlfriend I've been with 15 going on 16 years. I told her a few months back, she was as pretty shaken up since I had hid it from her so effectively for so long. Told one of my best friends who I've know 30 years, he took it well, he told me he already suspected, so at least that went well. Won't need to worry about telling my dad, waited to long on that one, he passed last year. Will probably never tell my mom, she's a narcissist.

It goes in waves, at least for me. Sometimes there is weeks between the highs and lows sometimes years.

It got better for me when I found a good therapist, and fully committed to fighting my depression. Now I view it as a war, me vs depression.

I wake up every morning ready to do battle, even during my high times where my depression is doing well I still never even for a day let my guard down. It is mentally exhausting. Some people would say that's a hell of a way to live your life. To those people I'd say hey, at least I'm still here."

As far as your family being against you well that's pretty common, you may need to stay in the closet as they say until you are able to move out on your own and openly express your sexuality.

As far as being tired that's not usually a issue for me as when I get into a low time depression wise I generally spend most of my free time sleeping as I have no motivation to do anything else and my two cats are pretty good at curling up in my arms in bed and purring me to sleep. Only downside to this is it upsets the SO because she almost never sees me, but, as I've mentioned to her a few times now when I'm that low she probably doesn't want to spend time with me anyways.

depression,fqihiwh,t3_gj2ae0,1589396073.0,"I'll say this. On my search for a therapist I met good ones and I met bad ones. Some were good at their jobs but not right for me, others were horrible at their jobs but I got along with well. I eventually found the right one to help me. It took over a year, I met around a dozen therapist over this search. I was diagnosed by this point, but some of them didn't even bother reading my file to see that and actually brought up that I may be depressed in the first few meetings, so it's certainly possible for a therapist to pick up on depression. 

My suggestion is if you click with this person, and feel comfortable talking to them, and you truly believe they have your best interests in mind then I'd keep seeing them.

Drugs may work for you, if they do there is nothing wrong with that. I tried many, I wanted them to work so bad it hurt. But at the end of the day drugs were not my salvation. Been struggling through this with therapy and a great supportive friends groups for 2+ decades now."
depression,fqifjvo,t3_gj2w6e,1589395327.0,"Well, I'm on the other side of this one. Been depressed 20+ years. Lost a few relationships due to it. Just actually opened up to my current SO about it earlier in the year, I had been with her 15 years at that point. The fact that I waited so long to tell her should tell you something. I hadn't told her earlier because every time I have told a SO before her it eventually ended the relationship, or made my depression alot worse(pro tip, never tell a narcissist you are depressed, they will probably use it as a weapon against you).

Moving on here is my suggestion. Let her manage her own depression, you arnt her therapist, you arnt her psychologist. Of course you can support her in other ways but the main method of dealing with her depression should not involve you. If you are worried she's not eating enough try and find those few foods she truly enjoys and make them for her. Try to not to judge her decisions. 

One last thing. And I'm saying this as someone who has battled depression for 20+ years. If she's not taking steps to address and fight her depression daily, it WILL get worse and you will watch her deteriorate before your eyes. This is very hard to do, I've done it a few times. It's why I won't date anyone with depression anymore unless they are like myself and dedicated to the fight to beat it. I won't date anyone taking no steps to address their depression, to hard for me to watch that as a depressed person myself.

Best of luck."

I mean even the people saying seek help, while that's the right thing to do, it's not a easy or quick fix either. Took me over a year to figure out drugs didn't work for me, another year after that to find a therapist that worked for me. When I ""got help"" it was just the tip of the iceberg on my depression journey.
