I have been managing to accomplish small routine goals. It‚Äôs actually the most consistent I have ever been. Is there hope for more control overall with just LIFE? like being able to juggle/handle everything?"

I think you should tell someone.. they need to be aware of this. This is not normal behavior. It IS very freaking scary. It‚Äôs his way of acting out his fantasies is how I see it. Protect yourself hun.
stepparents,fop271j,t1_fooyky1,1587951449.0,"Yeah I mean you‚Äôre being real with yourself. Just a messy situation especially during these times. Maybe at least for now try not to focus so much on it. You‚Äôre also pregnant so everything is heightened. Kids are difficult regardless you know?

Do things you love. Learn new skills. Take care of your body. Eat well. You have to work day by day on loving yourself. You won‚Äôt have time to hate him. If anything you‚Äôll just feel sorry for him. You‚Äôre gonna get there. Be patient with yourself.
curlyhair,fooa8i3,t1_fonr29v,1587935444.0,You could try moisturizing your beard and running a comb through it. Maybe a little coconut oil or jojoba. That should help instead of you shaving it off. Just a suggestion.

It became your comfort zone. You left for a reason. This quarantine is giving you too much time to think. You‚Äôre looking for your normal. Abuse isn‚Äôt normal. He isn‚Äôt gonna change.

Maybe there are other things you can do together like video games or PC games. Another way to connect. But threatening to break up with you is obviously hurtful and it‚Äôs backing you into a corner.

relationship_advice,fn7ctwt,t3_fzrhah,1586717809.0,I think it‚Äôs a little immature to share body counts. It‚Äôs private. It was in the past. All it does it cause friction and put unnecessary thoughts in your partners head.
