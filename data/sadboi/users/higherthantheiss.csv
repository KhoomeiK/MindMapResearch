Do you have a therapist? Asking only because mine has helped me tremendously. If spirituality is your thing have you thought about going to a group, or trying meditation? 

I realize meditation is a pretty shitty alternative when you‚Äôre addicted lol but thought I‚Äôd throw it in there. Therapy worked wonders for me.
