depression,exx4a9b,t3_cuikhp,1566629970.0,"Honestly I never thought it would happen to me.  I only smoked cigarettes once in my life just to try it when I was seventeen, I never drank much.  I did the fuck out of psychedelic drugs though.  Tryptamines were my intoxicant of choice.  I kinda think it was environmental.  I used to work around asbestos and lead based paint a lot.  I left my family a reminder of that Incase they want to pursue a lawsuit to pay for all my medical care.  A nurse sees me once a week and even that’s a lot."
depression,exw4wal,t3_cuikhp,1566612816.0,"It is what it is.  I could’ve buckled down and applied myself.  I feel like I would’ve really been capable of being something.  I still have some time to do something meaningful.  I’m thinking about writing a book or some other cliche cancer end of life type shit.  I mean who knows, I might beat this thing.  If the universe deems I need to suffer 50 or 60 more years hey, that’s pretty good."
depression,exv364b,t1_exv1l8j,1566591886.0,"I’ve tried everything available. Medical cannabis, chemotherapy different oncologists etc.  I mean maybe it’ll get better but it’s pretty much spread to different areas of my body.  I’m not hopeful"

ftm,erw8ue5,t3_c4bkm2,1561336525.0,My neighbor’s shih tzu when I was growing up got into a fight with our cat and the shih tzu ended up losing both it’s eyes.  We had told our neighbors over and over to build a fence for their dog and we even offered to build one for them for free because their dog was always wondering on our property.  My dad almost ran over it on his way to working the graveyard shift.  They just let their dogs run loose too much and never neutered their animals.  They moved when hawks kept killing their shih tzus.
mentalhealth,erw6ymb,t3_c40kjh,1561334974.0,"Absolutely, I am disabled and have never worked a job longer than a couple weeks because of my disability.  I need more money than what I’m getting but since I have no skills it really pisses me off when people are like well, just get a job.  Oh gee, I never fucking thought about that!  I guess the paralyzed man in the wheelchair (me) is just as capable of working as you, a fully able normal human can.  I’m in horrendous debt from school loans, I am 27 and have never gotten my learners permit or even drove a vehicle because of my epilepsy.  I sometimes really hate people."

mentalhealth,epkld3t,t3_busdm5,1559276356.0,"I am 27 and haven’t accomplished Jack shit with my life because I became disabled in 2010.  I can’t work, never got a drivers license and I have insane debts from not working.  I wish so bad to just die and have all this bullshit subside.  I’m pretty sure I have cancer now since I’ve been losing weight at a rapid pace and all my tests look concerning.  Honestly I hope it is fucking cancer life is hell and we’re unlucky enough to live in a capitalistic society that only sees the dollar value in us rather than the human value.  I’m jealous of people who’ve had the balls to kill themselves this world is a fucking never ending nightmarish hell."
politics,ep2i2q6,t3_btpbjm,1559008614.0,Thank God I’m disabled.  I’d much rather get roasted by atomic annihilation than be a bullet sponge fighting for a bulllshit cause only because some billionaires aren’t happy with what they already have.
worldnews,ep1p0s9,t3_btmaq0,1558992761.0,Working always gave me massive burnout in only a couple weeks.  I’m just not cut out to be a functional member of society.  I live with this constant fear that I try to hide but it always resurfaces no matter the job.  I’ve only ever held a job for a few weeks.

DentalSchool,eoh403d,t3_broe1v,1558572360.0,I have two lower impacted wisdom teeth I cannot afford to remove.  A dental school was able to get it down to 200 dollars but that’s far too much.  I would’ve owed two hundred out of pocket but my credit score was way too low to afford payments of any type.  Can I get them removed at the e.r?  Sometimes I get a really bad fever with chills and vomiting but I can’t afford to do anything about it.
