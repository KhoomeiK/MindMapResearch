schizophrenia,fr49a5a,t3_gmhk62,1589880417.0,"I can tell you my story it's a bit of a short one but it's why I gave myself my username,

I decided to join the military because I was severely depressed and saw things going south and thought becoming the thing I hated was going to be enough to bring me to finally kill myself, as I hated the higher echelon of the military and what they stood for.

Along with partially wanting to join to give back to my country, due to my family's unfortunate circumstances.

This is how I thought I would fuck up my entire life as I honestly felt I had nothing left to live for. Turns out I loved the lifestyle a bit too much. Idk why but I fit in pretty well with the rest of the folks that shared the same rank as I did. It changed my life. 

Then my mental state, started getting worse, like real bad, seeing things, hearing things that I still don't want to hear, and still don't want to see. Thinking I'm cartaphilus, which I still do btw, I thought it was all an overactive imagination. However it took me to the point of wanting to off myself, which was the original goal of this charade anyways, to get help. And I did, went through many doctors and many psych wards to attain a manageable disposition. As it is currently.

Then things started hurting again after a loss of a friend due to a less than appropriate situation. Idk why but anything vaguely wrong that happens to me feels magnified by a million. And the compounded pain life gives me makes me want to cry, all the time. Life rn is just breaks in between the tears and that's it.

Yeah, switching his meds might solve his problem. Especially since some are definitely more hardcore, especially if he's taking a combination.

Like as someone with a schizo based disorder he should definitely be seeing a general practitioner (which he has to be already seeing for his meds) once a month, a psychiatrist once a month, and a therapist at least once every two weeks, that's just the norm. Like literally call appointments are ok most of the time, if going to a place is difficult for him.

Nowadays they prefer some form of video chat especially with antipsychotics as they're watching for extraparamital symptoms and tardive dyskinesia.

You sadly cannot force him unless he's a danger to himself or others, or unable to make medical decisions on his own (determined by the doctor) and you have medical power of attorney.

I would talk to him, have another heart to heart, and explain to him that he is not himself, he is nowhere near himself, and that you want to see the old him come back, the guy who you liked hanging out with and was good to play video games with. That you want to see him get better, and not stagnate where he is, and that for him to get better, he needs to see a psychiatrist, and he needs to see a therapist or psychologist, because you really want the old him back.

Also sounds like his psychiatrist is overmedicating him, because I know what that's like, both dealing with myself, my aunt and uncle, and spending more than enough time in psych wards to be totally sick of them.
I've been on alot of meds, but I only know what works and doesn't work for me, and schizo based disorders are such a huge spectrum of things that it's really alot of person by person trial and error to figure things out.

Some doctors think that no hallucinations or delusions are prioritized over the function of the patient, which is completely unethical in my opinion, sure the hallucinations/delusions are awful, but I'd rather be functional then be a zombie. 

 I call it a chemical lobotomy, whatever he is on, either needs to be reduced or exchanged with a different medication. Sounds like he should be going to a different psychiatrist. There are trade offs, but your brother should be able to weigh what's worth it and what's not, and if not, honestly, you could talk with him and get power in the sense of a medical power of attorney to help control his medications, and get him better, as unlike your parents, you actually seem to have his best interest in mind.

Also, like no one has any idea what he's thinking or feeling but him. Because again, schizo based disorders are such a huge spectrum of things that it could be literally anything. Idk how to get it out of him. And maybe it is literally nothing because his brain is so foggy that he can't patch things together well, because he is overmedicated."

You are trying to make my illness seem illegitimate. Just because you have different symptoms.
