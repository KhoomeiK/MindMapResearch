Look up Serenity pH and let me know you have diabetes and that you are a sex worker (?) if you are. I will help you with supply and knowledge and will change your life the same way I helped myself and thousands of women in Aust and OS. I have never turned a woman away for any reason. I run my business like a charity and I really care deeply about sharing my knowledge. 
It’s so dangerous when you live with BV long term and for many women antibiotics don’t work or are too hard to tolerate. 

These are easy and work while you sleep. I will send you some for free to try if you DM me."

psychotherapy,fqmmrpf,t1_fqm6e8f,1589480035.0,"I think his definition is correct. A patient crying doesn’t want to see their therapist tear up .... which is what usually happens when there is strong empathy. 
When you watch a sad movie and you cry this is empathy also. Empathy usually results in a physical display of emotion close to what the sufferer is feeling. 
However being empathetic doesn’t imply caring about helping, it just means you feel bad. Imo"
psychotherapy,fqmlywv,t1_fqm128b,1589479649.0,Agree 100%
psychotherapy,fqmk5pu,t3_gjnpby,1589478779.0,"Empathy is not as important as compassion imo. I also think too much empathy wastes time in the therapy session. I think it’s far more helpful to hyper focus on what you are being told by clients and to validate their experiences. I don’t think you need to experience the pain yourself to be able to offer very good advice and support. 

Empathy means you really put yourself in the other person’s situation. Empathy can make you feel terrible about hearing bad things but your feeling bad doesn’t actually help your client. Compassion however is where you take action to help your client improve their life. 

I think it’s better not to get too emotionally invested so that you feel bad for your clients.  They need you to be objective. And the fact that you rejoice when you see patients get better means you are genuine and not faking it. 

I am similar to you and I manage to help thousands of women... don’t be so hard on yourself. My advice though is to find an area to specialise that speaks to your strengths. Use your hyper focus ability, your calmness and your natural curiosity to perhaps have clients who need lots of detective work and fact finding. 
I think you sound very self aware and you do want to do the right thing which points to you being a great candidate for being a therapist. Good luck .... ageing will help with the empathy part imo"
