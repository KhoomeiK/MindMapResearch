My daughter wasn’t diagnosed until age 10. It presents very differently in girls. Girls had not been properly diagnosed in the past, contributing to the increase in diagnoses. We also now know it is a spectrum disorder ranging from socially awkward to severely impaired. Including this factor, the rates have risen. I heard today the prevalence is around 1 in 54 children.
