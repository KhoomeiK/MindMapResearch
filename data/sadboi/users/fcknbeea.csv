Stress,fqz8j67,t3_glpl66,1589762115.0,"No, you’re not being dramatic or overreacting. It’s not your fault at all that he treats you like this, remember this. I’m in a pretty similar situation with my ‘dad’ too and it have been like that since I was 6 (I’m 18yo now). All I do is simply ignore. I know it’s hard but that’s the only way I found to not get more stressed out. I isolate myself from him as much as possible. Try to forget your surroundings a little bit. Listen to music you like, talk with people you trust, draw or write anything. I recommend you to write down your feelings on a safe place if you don’t feel comfortable talking with other people, that helped and still helps me a lot to deal with stress. 

You don’t need to be perfect for him. If he doesn’t appreciate you and your efforts, don’t waste your time, that will only make things worse for your health. 

I hope this somehow helped you. Stay safe."
desabafos,fqyr2yp,t3_glfi79,1589753147.0,"eu me sinto do mesmo jeito. Pior é q eu to me isolando desde março e as raras vezes q eu saio eu to sempre de máscara e álcool gel evitando qualquer contato próximo, mas parece q tá sendo inútil pq eu vivo com uma pessoa q trabalha com o público (ônibus) e não toma cuidado nenhum com nada quando chega em casa e agora eu e minha mãe estamos com suspeita de covid sendo q a gente se cuidou o tempo todo. Graças a Deus a gente n tá com nenhum sintoma grave e não precisa de internação, mas olha q merda, eu to sacrificando minha sanidade pra no fim correr risco do mesmo jeito por causa de um filha da puta q não tá nem aí. Grande dia."
Stress,fqypn90,t3_glmooj,1589752475.0,"I think you should talk to him about it. In my opinion, this kind of behavior is really weird, but it can be nothing at all. Talk to him about it and watch his reaction. You’re not a creepy or a psycho for this, you’re in a relationship and obviously you don’t wanna get cheated on, that means you still care for you both. You don’t have to feel weird bc of it. 💕"

G59,fqol0lm,t3_gjpm27,1589517740.0,"I just finished listening to the album. I’m very open minded when it comes to music but I can say it is really repetitive ngl. I’m not saying that I didn’t like it, because I did and I can see he’s being experimental and trying new things, that’s really cool. For now, my top five is 1. Fight Club (Psychosis) 2. Nightmare from the northside. 3. El Guerro 4. El paseo 5. Naloxone.  

A lot of songs aren’t THAT memorable, but it’s just my first time listening, so it can change. Ngl I missed Ruby verses on a few ones but I prefer to think that’s because I’m used to $B. 

Guess it’s a 7,5/10 8/10 for me."

Anxiety,fpo5woc,t3_geiyn7,1588778930.0,"I do. Back to my school days, I remember I wouldn’t do any math exercises because I knew I wouldn’t know how to do it anyway and I was too anxious to ask anyone for help. Because of that I failed almost every single math test bc I wasn’t “trained enough”. It sucks."
Anxiety,fpnc1vf,t3_geb6jx,1588757570.0,"I feel that a lot. One time my day was ruined and I felt awful after I gave someone a wrong answer for a simple question. When I hear someone laughing or whispering to another person, I ALWAYS feel like they’re laughing or joking about me. I can’t feel normal when someone is staring at me, I just start to shake and panic and feel that might be something wrong with me. I hate that."
