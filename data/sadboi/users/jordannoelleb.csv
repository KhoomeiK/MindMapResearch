Evictions can still be filed against you and will still show up on your background check. You just can‚Äôt be forced from the dwelling yet.

\*Update/Edit\*

I was informed this morning that all evictions and foreclosure will be halted until May 17th. The information on it is still vague but from what I can gather all currently ongoing evictions will be paused no matter where in the process they are. Additionally, no new evictions can be filed during this time."
