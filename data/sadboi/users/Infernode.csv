I would probably never say those things out loud to them that I spoke about in the previous reply because obviously people don't like to be told they have been manipulated in any way. Regarding the aspect of polarization, I think there are actually simple answers to eliminate it, but the current political climate is making it difficult to get there. 

However, I believe that it starts with an improvement in education and encouraging a more secular society, rather than one that is very religious in nature. Statistically, the more educated people are, the more likely they will adopt left-leaning ideas. This also applies when there is an absence of any type of religion because right-wing leaders tend to use religious fearmongering to keep people in line. For example, observe the evangelical vote back in 2016. It certainly helped put Trump over the edge."

I'm sure that many of us are very disappointed at the moment. If you aren't moderate and wanted significant change to the system, I completely understand how you're feeling at the moment. However, if Trump is given another term, there will be consequences that won't be able to be erased for decades. 

We have to understand that while we have serious, fundamental disagreements on policy with Biden, we have MUCH more of a disagreement with Trump of how this country should operate. Biden wants to increase the federal minimum wage. He wants to end private prisons. He at least supports a 2-year free college plan. He wants to try to expand on the ACA. Yes, it isn't Medicare For All, but Trump would be just fine TAKING PEOPLE OFF their healthcare. (2017 repeal attempt.)
