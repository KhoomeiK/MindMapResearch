IBD,ff7gz8n,t1_ff6thgn,1579649323.0,"Specific PT treatments actually helped my AS (along with diet, which I’m sure you’ve heard). I was suicidal from the pain before I started, to give you an idea how bad it was. Most PTs weren’t able to help, but one did. She had special training in Active Release Technique (ART). She began each treatment with muscle tests. She was basically finding a muscle that was “deactivated” and then doing a stretch or pressing really hard into that muscle, maybe using the graston tool. It wasn’t a massage, which doesn’t work because it’s not specific enough. She would feel the muscle and say it was bound up or gritty. She would rub or press into it in that tiny spot until she could feel with her fingers that the muscle felt supple again. She was an expert in feeling muscles basically. she slowly untangled all my pains. The PT ended each appointment by testing the muscle again and showing me how it was already working again. The results were immediate from that session and they didn’t depend on me doing exercises. But she would give me an exercise to strengthen it anyway, which I didn’t always do. I didn’t have to do those exercises forever anyway because the PT would do this process on a different muscle the next time and so on. Over time I got more range of motion and now live virtually pain free. The PT said I need PT forever and now I’m looking for a new one to continue the process and stay out of pain. I’ve also heard some chiropractors do this type of technique."

Instead I just got terrible stomach aches, which sadly no one attributed to the artificial colors. My stomach somehow developed a tolerance to the allergens and didn’t hurt as bad after a while, although it did still hurt at times. I was only a kid and the stomach aches wouldn’t happen right away after eating, so I couldn’t make the connection and neither could my parents or doctor. I went on like this for nearly two decades until all those years of eating artificial colors finally caught up with me. My gut suddenly couldn’t take it anymore and it led to additional heath problems, which I won’t go into. My doctors were mystified even when I wrote “allergic to artificial colors as a child” on my intake forms, which they all ignored. It has taken more than a decade since then to figure out that I never “outgrew” my allergy at all. I’m still working on how to avoid my allergen after many years neglecting it."

I also had leaky gut and it led to pain in my back right where the food started to leak out of my gut.  And people want to say leaky gut isn’t real?  Because leaky gut isn’t proven my others docs wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole.  But when I was suffering I didn’t care if it was proven.

FoodAllergies,f1erw14,t1_f1dusj1,1569428903.0,"So much - they actually studied what was living in my gut with tests the other docs never bothered doing.  They worked with me on diet when the other docs claimed there was no such thing as an anti-inflammatory diet.  They also spent tons of time with me talking, which a regular doc would never do.  The naturopaths were really committed to finding the answers and we did.  I had been to Kaiser, Stanford and Ohio State over the course of a decade being told harsh drugs like biologics were the only answer.  So glad I didn’t listen.  I’ve fixed my pain by fixing my gut.

Edit: after reading more of your post I can really relate.  I went through very similar things.  The probiotics are only going to make things worse right now, don’t take them until everything settles out.  You might have to go on a bone broth diet like GAPS and eat nothing but that and some meat, slowly adding in other foods.  The naturopaths can help you do this.

Another edit:  after reading the other comments I just want to say that GI docs never helped me with these same issues.  They did an invasive colonoscopy but didn’t want to try something harmless like diet changes.  Also, thought it might help you to hear what my actual problem was in the end bc I had severe diarrhea every day for a decade.  It’s hard to write this out here, but I want to help.  My issue was a severe artificial color allergy which also encompasses artificial flavors, natural flavors and caramel color.  These things are in so many foods it’s why I couldn’t easily identify the problem.  It could be something tiny like that for you, too.  They also tried testing me for celiac but I knew it wasn’t something that easily identifiable.  Follow your gut and don’t listen too much to the supposed experts if they’re blowing you off and not getting to the root of things.  Good luck."
