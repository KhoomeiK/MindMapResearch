the sun and stars, they were simply not accustomed to meteorological fluidity.
   Jerico was from Madagascar—one of the world's seven, Charter Regions, where the Thunderhead employed different social structures to better the human experience—and people flocked to Madagascar because of the popular uniqueness of its mandate.

   All children in Madagascar were raised genderless and for-bidden to choose a gender until reaching adulthood. Even then, many didn't choose a single state of being. Some, like Jerico, found fluidity to be their nature.

""I feel like a woman beneath the sun and the stars. I feel like a man under the cover of clouds,"" Jerico had explained to the

crew when assutning cotnmand. ""A simple glance at the skies will let you know how to address me at any given time.""
   It wasn't the fluidity that stymied the crew—that was common enough—but they had trouble getting used to the meteorological aspect of Jerico's personal system. Having been raised in a place where such things were the norm rather than the exception, it never even occurred to Jerico that it could be an issue, until leaving home. Some things simply made a person feel feminine; other things made a person feel masculine. Wasn't that true of everyone regardless of gender? Or did binaries deny themselves the things that didn't fit the mold? Well, regardless, Jerico found the faux pas and overcompensations more humorous than anything else.

[*Context: Insane mom thinks it would be ""unfortunate"" if her kids died of COVID-19, isn't following social distancing rules because that will somehow save the economy, which is more important.*]



>User 1: I won't follow it. I barely am now. This is ridiculous. We just need to let nature take its course. 



>User 2: So how many thousands of preventable deaths are we supposed to allow? you're willing to let your loved ones get sick and die so we can hang out and go shopping? Species go extinct from ""Nature taking its course"". 



>User 1: Natural selection.

>User 1: Yes it would be unfortunate if me or anyone of my family got sick and died. It would be heartbreaking. But I would accept that it was their time to go. 

>User 1: This is going to destroy our economy. For years to come. It's not worth it. A 10-year great desperation will negatively impact millions more people then the deaths this is causing. 



>User 2: Then why do anything at all to stay healthy? Why ever go to the doctor or take the any medication whatsoever? Why wear a winter coat or sunscreen? Why avoid bears when camping? Why look both ways before you cross the street? Maybe it's your time. SMDH.

>User 2: Having less money is better than being dead.



>User 1: Because those things don't ever impact anyone else. 


>User 2: So poor people would be better off dead?



>User 1: not if they do t think so... if I struggled to eat every day, if I struggled to make ends meet every single day... I'd want to be dead. Me personally. 



>User 2: Well I've been there and id rather not have strangers putting my life at risk so stay home, lady! Do you have children? You're literally risking their long term health and their lives. Is it SO selfish. 



>User 1: I won't... thank you for your advice... and I do... 3 of them and I really don't think it's selfish at all. If you think this virus is as ""crazy"" as the media is making it, you are extremely native... a 20-year-old COPD patient could die while having a virus and if the hospital can get its expenses written off by saying COVID-19 they will. This has been blown way out of pro...



>User 2: Yes, I am NAIEVLY listening to the international experts in disease control. If your concern is the economy... How bad will it hurt the economy to have tens or hundreds of thousands of dead workers? Because that's not a great fiscal scenario

Note from father...

read this whole email before you delete or decide you had enough of your fathers words. 

This is in no way of making you feel bad or anything else. I love you and I am very proud of you in everything you have done on your own. We are all very proud of you. 

BUT...

At the moment I am upset/ angry at you because of the way you are being towards me, your mother and (Blank). 

Not all the time, but the last couple of months. Maybe it's not the work, stress a combination or even outside influence in how your attitude and your persona had changed. It has changed. Not in a good way. We know you've us but talking to us and treating us like we are strangers or we are beneath you is a little too much. You will probably think ""Oh im not like that"", you're not. But you have been acting like that, the past few months. 

You, being where you are (In school, work, N.Y. etc.) has been a combination effort by your whole family. 

That as right your WHOLE family. I don't want to take anything away from you because you have worked really hard to get to where you are and your brother and ALL your cousin look up to you as a role model and inspiration. 

They are all proud of you and you set a marker for them. All your uncles and aunts are proud of you as well as your grandfather and both your grandmothers. You know that. 

Anyways, if money, which has been a very touchy thing for YOU or the way I have gone about it in borrowing or taking Is such a big problem. its very disappointing because up to this point, I thought or took for granted that  it would be reciprocal but I was wrong. I will not ask you or bother you ever again on then money issue. 

Maybe you will soften your stance in the future with your mother and brother not just financially but in your mannerism, respect and treatment as loved individuals not just people who need to hear and do as you say.

You're a very smart man, don't forget that GOD comes first then FAMILY, then work and finally friends. In that order. 

I will do everything I can to support you so you can finish college and succeed in life. I Love You! 

Your WHOLE family is rooting for you! We love you!

Since this whole COVID-19 epidemic>pandemic, my wife been OCD about giving blowy - so I bought lysol wipes for my shaft. Great for spontaneous blowys if you are lazy to go shower or away from home. She usually does it to me before bed - after I showered. sometimes you just got home or on the road and you craving it - the wipes come in handy

Stop gaslighting. You should be ashamed for doing this. This is offensive to millions of LGTBQ people to even suggest Bernie is an [LGTBQ] ally. He only uses our struggles to get votes. This is a man who called human rights campaign the establishment. He hasn't done anything for us

Someone asked me if I had planned my wedding (as most teenage girls do) and my response was ""no but I planned my funeral""

His face was priceless lol he asked why and I told him ""marriage isn't guaranteed but death is"" needless to say he was slightly afraid of me
