I will disagree with he majority of people who say this school doesn't care about you. While I can only speak for Muir, I will defend the UCSD emergency support until my dying breathe and have plans to be able to donate as soon as able. 

When I was homeless, I was given emergency housing within 24 hours and had a month for me (and my dog) to figure something out. 

When I had no money to feed my family, $400 was sent to my Student Account so I could go to some of the markets and buy bread and eggs and peanut butter and ramen so we could all eat. An administrator unlocked the food pantry after hours so I could grab food before I had to make my bus back home.

CAPs got me connected with an incredible psychiatrist that is helping me take control of my life again, and the insurance provided by the school covered my other specialists and medical needs (endocrinologist, epileptologist, physical therapist, optometrist, dentist). 

I will say, for the majority of this care you have to know how to ask, and you have to be your own best advocate. I'm not sure if I'm the exception or the norm, but I don't like to think about where I, or my family, would be without this school.

You're in a very sketchy world. It's okay to take them BUT you'd have to follow all of the merchant rules carefully (can be found in your merchant with your merchant bank (square, BofA, etc)). 

Chargebacks. The merchant (that's you) will lose almost everytime. Porn sites had this issue when they first began. To avoid this, he'd need to sign a receipt that exactly matches the merchant statement on his card. 

You'll need to invest in a chip or mag stripe reader. If you take just the online stuff, you'll need billing zip code, cvc code, cardholder name, etc. 

Discount rate will be huge. Banks will charge you a huge amount to process your information if you're untrustworthy.
