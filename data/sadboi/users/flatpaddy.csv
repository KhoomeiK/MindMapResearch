MMORPG,ezki09u,t1_ezjv1l9,1567960595.0,"Oh boy.. you're going to be so disappointed. As someone who've tried their games several times, you can't trust their words, really.. they break their promises and will try to milk everyone dry really hard in every way possible until there's no one left, and at that point, they shut down the server.

PS: Gamigo acquired Trion and Aeria Games, so they're basically the same company."

electronic_cigarette,ey1wlro,t1_exxyqek,1566714271.0,"So to make this clear. Since I have two 15A Max Continious Discharge batteries, I should never set the wattage setting above 90W, right?

Also, in Drag 2, they have FIT modes 1/2/3. Do the devices adjust the wattage settings automatically according to the modes? I cannot find anywhere regarding FIT mode's wattage output on each profile. Should I be not using FIT mode and just manually adjust the wattage in Wattage Mode?"
electronic_cigarette,exxtb1q,t1_exxph5v,1566642256.0,Thank you for replying. One more question is; how do I control the current drawn? Is it something that is a set/fixed by the mod manufacturer or I can change the value? (In this case i'm using Drag 2)

com3d2,exe7xxn,t1_exe79pc,1566202878.0,"Hi there, I fixed my problem by uninstalling ""Leap Motion"" . I used the mod guide that was written in Steam's Forum, that let me see the console debugger and I stumbled upon the message something like ""Waiting for leap service"" and it times out and made the game freezes, so I figured it had something to do with the software. Hope this helps."
