2. counting every second i'm alive, especially if i'm doing something 'unnecessary' and then feel like i've wasted my whole life because i sat and did nothing for just 5 minutes

I'm actually going to the shelter today :) But the shelters in Sweden aren't as open as in other countries. For example, you're not allowed to visit dog shelters unless you know you're going to adopt a dog or unless it's a special event (there are events maybe twice or thrice a year?) and I think most cat shelters work the same way, but there are at least some 'open' cat shelters. It's really sad :/"

Maybe it's also because of the chair? XD"
