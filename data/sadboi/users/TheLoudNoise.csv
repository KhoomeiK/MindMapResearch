TumblrInAction,fnjsw9x,t1_fnifjgg,1587006225.0,"First of all, I only wish I could be as accepting as you. Please teach me your ways, especially in these trying times.

From my own personal experience: I’m a trans male (born a female) and I used to act overly masculine in order to “survive” when I wasn’t able to go on hormones. I felt that to be accepted as a man, I had to be sure others could see I was in fact a man behind all the feminine features I was painfully stuck with. It would be harder for people to dismiss me as a girl if I acted so stereotypical. 

Now that I’m on hormones and am perceived as male 100% of the time, I no longer find myself pretending. I am sometimes masculine, sometimes feminine, just like every other human. I’m just me, and I’m more comfortable with myself now. I don’t need to “close the gap” between mind and body by changing my personality, I am a man, everyone understands I am a man and isn’t constantly trying to tell me I’m not, and so I don’t need to prove myself to anyone anymore just to get by. To me, this has always been what “becoming your true self” has been about, not just coming out to everyone. It’s just as much an internal battle."

truscum,fn52f89,t3_fzebgv,1586654316.0,"I think for some people it’s because there’s no accepted gender neutral third person singular pronoun in their language, I know someone who is NB who claimed to have DID used it for the reason that it/they didn’t feel it/they were always human. Some people say they do it for reasons relating to trauma, which I don’t understand but I can’t really expect myself to, since it’s their trauma, not mine. 

Then there’s the group that wants to feel special and edgy. I feel like this is the majority of the “it/its” people, not that they’re very common in the first place.

AskReddit,fl63w18,t3_fmu40n,1584853607.0,"(Sorry for the long answer!)

FtM here. For me, there were small hints during childhood, but by the time I entered high school I was hit with the anxiety like a train. It was like a horrible itch you can’t scratch that stays with you from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep. I had always loved my long hair and vowed never to cut it, but suddenly as I entered high school I couldn’t stand to have it down. I needed to make my chest as flat as possible or I couldn’t leave my room. I fought tooth and nail to avoid shaving my legs, because it would make me sick to look at them when they were smooth like a woman’s. I didn’t even really know why. 

I was so ashamed of my voice I developed crippling social anxiety. I couldn’t even talk to my friends on the phone, or order food anywhere without having a panic attack. It felt like everything was wrong, and that everyone sees me in this awful form and this body I’ve been forced into. I felt too feminine on the outside to be comfortable with the boys and too masculine on the inside to be comfortable with the girls, so I withdrew from everyone and felt like even more of an abomination. 

Weird thing is, it’s not that I really hated *my* body, because it didn’t feel like mine. I didn’t hate how my hair looked, or how my body was shaped or anything, except for that it was mine and I couldn’t escape it. If I was a girl, truly, I would’ve been happy with my body. It was more of a hatred for the anxiety than a hatred for the body itself, I guess. More the mismatching than me thinking I’m ugly. Something a lot of people say about dysphoria is that it’s just body insecurity, like everyone else. I’m not saying dysphoria is worse by any means, but it definitely hits different. 

At the time, I started to experiment with different names and since hearing my feminine name just gave me jolts of fear and shame. It was degrading. Day in and day out, being called the same shit that made me hate my life. I would go to chatrooms where I could be anonymous and have a masculine name, where people could call em “he,” and see how I felt when people called me that. Turns out, it felt really fucking good. It felt natural, for the first time in my life. The more masculine I went, the happier I was. That kind of made it obvious for me that I was trans. That, and I knew I wasn’t just a butch lesbian because I felt attracted to both genders equally lol. 

1/10, do not recommend. The only good thing that came from dysphoria is that I got to build who I am from the ground up. I could finally find out who I really was, and explore it with all the retrospect I had from previous years (not much, but it sure gives you a bit of help getting your shit together). 

If I were given the opportunity to be cis, I would take it in a heartbeat. But that’s not reality, so I did what I could. Now I’m trans, passing, and I know high school me could never even have imagined being as happy as I am now. 

Everyone’s dysphoria is different, but that’s just how mine appeared in my life. It never goes away, and I’m still in a bit of Hell waiting for top surgery, but even with the lingering anxiety about my chest and my height, I am happy! Those who say “most trans people regret transition” are just lying. I know many, many trans people, and transition has saved all their lives. I’m grateful they didn’t lose to dysphoria. I know it almost killed me."

I’m hoping that’s just something she does for everybody, since it’s a very liberal/inclusive environment and it wouldn’t really surprise me. Still uncomfy though. 

This reminds me, where I used to work, we had the option of making name tags with our pronouns on them, but the only people who chose to have that were enbies and other trans people. I just chose the plain one because I didn’t want to be associated with the “hi, I’m trans” group. It’s pointless for cis people to use them, and as long as I have a chance at passing as cis, I’m not gonna put myself in the spotlight.

“White folks doing white folks things. Not being racist but just pointing out the ridiculous shit these folks get away with”

“Only in America ,a selfish suicide cult has political power.”


On an article about the US government doing stupid US government bullshit: calling out Americans for being stupid just because their government is stupid 


An article about trump calling it “the Chinese virus”: people agreeing that it is “their (all of China, apparently) fault”

An article about the president of Brazil ignoring public health: comments about Brazilian people, of course 

An article about France banning brits unless Boris shuts the UK down:
A comment about “smelly Frenchmen” (lmao)

Article about a shooting in a Texas pub:

“Unlike a few other Texas cities, Corpus Christi had not shut down its bars or restaurants amid concerns of the coronavirus.

Because a drunk, fearful, gun enamored population seems like a good idea.”


Every article about a certain subject/demographic is going to have generalizing comments about that demographic. It’s not exclusive to nonreligious or nonwhite people."

worldnews,fkw21w6,t1_fkvxa60,1584581683.0,"You’re doing it again, though. A ton of religious weirdos are white, it’s comparing apples to oranges. By separating people complaining about “white” from people complaining about “religious” it *sounds* like what you’re saying is that there are no religious weirdos who are white which is definitely not true; there are plenty, and many people have been complaining about them just as much as other religious groups (unless you visit certain subreddits. I’m sure you know the ones I’m talking about). I don’t think you truly mean this but that’s what it sounds like, so expect people to comment on it. If you word something to sound mutually exclusive, people are going to take it that way, even if that’s not what you think you mean. 

Also saying “they would never do the same when seeing videos/reading articles of dumb white people” is just straight up not true. Have you seriously not seen the hundreds of videos, articles, comments, etc all complaining about how stupid people (who are almost always depicted as white) are hoarding toilet paper and shit like that from stores? About stupid (again, usually white) people showing up at pubs despite being told to stay home? People are calling that out even more than they call out religious gatherings, from both white religious folks AND religious folks of color. 

I get the frustration that many religious people of color get targeted a lot by media and hate. It sucks and I’m not going to deny that it’s a real thing that happens in the west. But like I said, if you’re bringing race (or any other demographic which is not mutually exclusive to religion for that matter) into a conversation which is only discussing religious people, then you are *making* it about race, even if you didn’t intend to. And while I completely agree with you that no one should be making sweeping statements about a group of people, it’s not a good look when you yourself are making a blanket statement (“people would *never* do xyz”) that is just not true. Everyone does it, it’s just good to recognize it."
worldnews,fkvnl34,t1_fkvn5cy,1584572882.0,"1. “I doubt you’d ever comment ‘It’s amazing the correlation between Darwin and white people’”. You brought race into a conversation about religion. This has nothing to do with “white people” despite both your comments separating “religious” and “white” as if they’re mutually exclusive. 

2. I agree with you. It’s harmful to associate a stupid minority with an entire demographic, and I don’t advocate for that with any race, religion, identity etc."
worldnews,fkviw24,t3_fkndyi,1584570111.0,"Why are people in this way? Just because you don’t care about yourself getting sick, you shouldn’t be a selfish bastard and go out to make it easier for other people who *can’t afford to get it* to get sick. Even if you’re not showing symptoms, stay the fuck inside. If not to protect yourself, do it to protect other people who you’re putting at risk. The world is bigger than yourself."

2. I think the reason people are calling out stupid religious folks in this thread instead of the other stupid non-religious folks is because the article is about the former. If it were about the latter, people would be talking about that instead."
conspiracy,fkuyoi8,t3_fkoe36,1584558619.0,"As bad my anxiety is about the pandemic, quarantine life suits me well. It makes total sense why people would be begging to stay home; I have time and energy to follow my passions for the first time in a long while now that I don’t have classes or work all day. I don’t have to see people or do anything if I don’t want to, which is nice because I’m an introvert. I can stay inside my own little world and finally enjoy the pause of life I’ve been needing. I think we all could use a pause button for life’s bullshit, and I’m certainly going to take advantage of the situation to the best of my ability. 

Advice for people stuck at home: watch a series you’ve been wanting to watch, start your book, pick up a quiet hobby like painting or knitting. Use the chaos for a long awaited chance at calm."

Honestly taking advantage of a group of people who haven’t even been adults living on their own for very long and likely need the money is kinda shitty"

At least some of the advice is helpful for anyone, I guess. Everyone can benefit from some stretching, deep breathing, etc."
TruePoliticalHumor,fkkwxp5,t3_fikp2q,1584293673.0,"Doesn’t matter unless it impacts herself ig

A lot of liberals seem to act “woke” when really all they care about is the attention they get from protesting. I often notice the only things they protest are the things that impact them directly, but when it comes to other issues, silence. If they were really so “woke” they’d expand their “activism” beyond their own sphere of responsibility. 

I know not all libs are like that but I see it far more often in their demographic than conservatives tbh"
