DnD,fqto5ld,t3_gkry6v,1589642792.0,"This actually happened in one of my games, set in an arabian nights sort of setting where the Rakshasa was a major underworld mafia-boss sort of thing, so hopefully I can help!

The Rakshasa stat-block says, "" **Limited Magic Immunity**: The [Rakshasa](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Zakya%20Rakshasa#h-Rakshasa) can't be affected or detected by [Spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#h-Spells) of 6th level or lower unless it wishes to be.

(ignore links, was a copy-paste)

And counterspell says, "" You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of [Casting a Spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#h-Casting%20a%20Spell). If the creature is [Casting a Spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells#h-Casting%20a%20Spell) of [3rd Level](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Artificer%20Spell%20List#h-3rd%20Level) or lower, its spell fails and has no effect.

The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.""

This can be argued either way.

Argument 1: Counterspell counters a **spell, not a creature**. Arguably, you are rolling a check against the spell's level to stop the spell's effect from occuring. This is how my DM ruled it, since the Rakshasa isn't the target of the spell, nor is it an AoE spell that ""affects"" him.

Argument 2: Counterspell targets the **caster of the spell**. Arguably, you are rolling a check against a spell, yes, but you are interrupting the creature casting the spell. You could say you're not stopping the spell, but stopping the spellcaster from even casting it in the first place.  


It can go either way really."
DnD,fqtncn6,t3_gktygp,1589642336.0,"Somewhere in the MM, I believe it states that weapons of a larger size (that is, weapons that are scaled up to be used by large+ creatures) simply have more hit dice dependent on the size.

\*Weapon size changes, not weapon wielder size affecting damage. If a dragon picks up a human's shortsword, it does 1d6, but if a human picks up a dragon's shortsword (assuming they can even lift it), it would do 4d6."

\- Dev Streams (showing animations and certain systems, such as swimming, flying, pouncing)

\- Animation Loops (on The Isle discord)

\- Sound Effects (although, only from Anthomnia's vids, so idk)

It sounds to me like they are giving ETAs repeatedly without actually realizing how long this stuff is going to take. Dondi might be an asshat, but he's an honest asshat, and I have to respect him for his truthfulness. He also has had a very nice-looking game made so far. 

Comparisons? This ""Delay-Code"" could easily be compared to Ark: Survival Evolved's update-ly delays. But with that game, in the beginning, like the Isle, it was a metric shitload of content pretty much every week (remember dossier reveals? That was genuinely nice). Now, they can't put out a DLC without delaying a month, then another month, before finally releasing. At the least, the Delay-Code hasn't been the ABSOLUTE FUCKING SHITSHOW that was Day of Dragons (or should we say, ""Eventually-Going-To-Maybe-Perhaps-Be-Day of Dragons""). I will give the Isle's devs that. Then again, I would give just about anyone the props of being better than Jao's immature handling of something that a damn toddler could've figure out (JUST SHOW THE DAMN CODE, would've been so easily to end that shit-typhoon early-on if you just SHOWED SOMETHING ORIGINAL, MAN!). 

But honestly, this game so far is very limited in ""quests"" or ""objectives"". It has one real objective, and thats to survive. Smaller objectives, such as getting food and traveling to water, are also there, but both feed into survival. Sometimes, you have food and water and nothing nearby to hunt you, so you just AFK, as there is LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE TO DO. That rumored Elder System sounds like a perfect cure to the cancer of boredom in this game. That or, y'know, the Delay-Code's release. But like, 16 months!? 1 year and a third of a year on top of that. I have to wonder how much ""from the ground up"" construction of code they're doing. Anyone got statistics or a timeline of pre-release development of the Isle? 

IDK. Seems like any other game's devs delaying stuff but just stretched over a longer time. Not an absolute shit-hurricane like Day of Dragons, and I would compare to Ark's DLC-ly delays. And also, 16+ months of recoding for what... 2 dinos? You're making the cancer of boredom even stronger if you only have one type of threat to fear.

AskReddit,fowca7v,t3_g7yupk,1588117008.0,"There's only 5000 giant anteaters in the world, and an anteater eats 30,000 ants in a day. Assuming an anteater lives around 15 years, thats around 5,475 days. Therefore, all the anteaters in the world, assuming they are born the day of this Humans-Ants War, and the war pursues until at least after the anteaters have all died of old age, that would equal about  821,250,000,000 total ants eaten in 15 years. 

Thats 82.1% of a trillion, which means that if all the anteaters alive today got together, birthed a new generations then all died, the new generation of anteaters wouldn't even devour 1% of all the ants on earth (they would get 0.82%). However, I'm not battling all the ants, and I don't have all the anteaters. So, how many ants can my equally-divided portion of anteaters eat?

Theres 7,500,000,000 people on earth, and 5,000 giant anteaters. Dividing anteaters equally amongst all humans on earth yields 1 Anteater/1,500,000 Humans. This means I get one one-million-and-five-hundred-thousandth of an anteater. Assuming that the anteaters are magically divided into smaller, tougher anteaters (tougher to eat ants that are bigger than they are, and still have the same proportional appetite), this little bugger will eat 0.02% of an ant every day. Assuming the Mini-Giant-Anteaters live just as long as their regular counterparts, 15 years of 5,475 days, he will eat.... 109.5 ants in 15 years. Thats 7.3 ants per year. THATS IT.

So, in conclusion, I would probably use bug spray, as the Mini-Giant-Anteaters when proportionally, magically, and equally distributed to each member of humanity cannot even make a dent in 0.1% of the ants I have to face."

ShitPostCrusaders,fcg4tqk,t3_eh7peg,1577636471.0,"ok so basically:

Dio and Jotaro can only stop time for so long. Imagine you're playing a video game, and you pause it. Well, technically, no time passes in the video game world, but time does pass while the video game is paused. Now, imagine that you can only pause a video game for a certain amount of time, like 10 seconds. 10 seconds pass on the pause screen during which you, the person, can still mess with the video game's settings, but the video game sees the pause as an instantaneously blink that it can't even notice. 

It is as if you add 10 seconds to the universe's time-span."

Since you're a pally, as long as you hit, you're gonna smite the SHIT out of them, right? You have, at level 4, a handful of level 1 smites. You do enough damage on a hit, you just need to make sure you hit."

Rather, just come down yourself or send an avatar. Make the avatar do some really incredible shit to prove that avatar is truly your embodiment. Like flying without any other supports. Or straight up punching rock in two. 

Scratch that: your avatar is a superhero ala Superman or All-Might who fashions himself as the pinnacle of human righteousness. People follow that role-model and those who reject it in favor of evil are fought against. 

\*Note: kinda pulling a Thanos here, but still he was right."
