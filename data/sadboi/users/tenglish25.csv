""14""

""who made the Silverado sir""

AnimalCrossing,ffpv1dp,t3_euiszj,1580106776.0,"I've always felt a weird relation with animal crossing in that when I play it myself I find I neglect my town and my depression causes me to lose interest and I feel bad leaving my neighbors behind. But I adore watching my friends play on their towns. It's like I get to be a part of a little friend group. 



Did I just r/2meirl4meirl or does that make sense?"

The 'cow-catcher' was made to help push the bovine off to the side without killing them, if done right."
