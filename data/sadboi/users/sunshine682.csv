I’m sorry after all you’ve tried that you are still suffering. How long have you been doing DBT? I wonder if you need more time. I try to remind myself that I spent 15 years without treatment for BPD and it’s going to take a while to undo that. I wish some of the depression meds worked for you. Would you be open to trying another? Meds have helped me enjoy things again. 

It sounds like you are very hard on yourself. I know that feeling when you’re trying so hard and it doesn’t seem to be working. You are trying and you are working very hard. Try to be gentle with yourself. You’re not alone."

Progress is not linear. If anything, you need more support. Not to be abandoned. Is he saying that even if you write this 8 page paper that you won’t be able to see him for the rest of the year? It’s very strange, like it hurt his ego.

BPD,fq8wvkl,t1_fq7rrxg,1589177920.0,"It totally still gets to me. I’m trying to be better about noticing when I’m like that. It’s usually when I’m using “shoulds.” I think even if they do think they’re superior to you, it really comes from a place of their own insecurity. And chances are they treat other people like that. Kind of like if someone at work is gossiping to you about someone, chances are they’re gossiping about you too. I really get where you’re coming from, I’m the same way and struggle with not having a fight response. It’s hard to stand up for myself in a calm, assertive way. I did a radical acceptance exercise about the pharmacy thing and it really helped. I found this pic on Facebook about when someone casts a judgment or criticize you and it’s helped me not internalize it: https://images.app.goo.gl/DA1zWj3oYBa6GWXW7"
BPD,fq5rosp,t3_ggy8lm,1589115603.0,I don’t agree with what they said at all. I’ve had these issues since I was 16 and wasn’t diagnosed until 29. In my family I was expected to put on a performance that things were good even when they weren’t. I can fake it well. I wasn’t officially diagnosed until after I had diagnosed myself with BPD. Bipolar/BPD/CPTSD can look similar. It’s not uncommon for BPD folks to be misdiagnosed.
BPD,fq5rdeh,t3_ggypuv,1589115345.0,"I learned about radical acceptance in DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy). It’s one of my favorite skills. Radical means to accept all the way, completely and totally. Basically to stop fighting reality and accept it as it is. It does not mean you approve or like your situation, just accept it. 

That’s a summary from my DBT book, I hope it didn’t come across harsh, the language in the book can be that way. 

As an example, recently I was very frustrated because I was having trouble getting my meds refilled. I was angry so I wanted to be rude and condescending. I was thinking things like “this shouldn’t be a problem!” The reality is that I can’t control other people, I can only control myself. My options are I can call and politely try to work it out or I can find another pharmacy. The reality is that being rude and condescending to people usually doesn’t turn out well and doesn’t get what I need or want. Instead of fighting reality and trying to control people, I accepted that I can’t do that and it was much easier to do what I needed to do. And turns out, I spoke to another person and everything is good. 

I think what your therapist means is to accept where you are right now. Thinking about the past and what you wish you would have done creates suffering. Everything that happened in the past has led up to now and that can’t be changed. My favorite go to is saying “It is what it is, all I can do is focus on what I’m going to do now.”"

I had someone say they were proud of me and how far I’ve come and it made me cry. I think it’s because in my family they were like that either because they wanted to look good in front of someone else or wanted something from me. Resulted in a lack of trust and ability to be vulnerable.
BPD,fq5nazr,t3_gf3eeb,1589111705.0,"I have Bipolar 2 and BPD, I think the meds I take help both. Even if BPD doesn’t respond to medication in the same way, meds can help stabilize moods and help with depression/anxiety which often occur with BPD.

To me, bipolar means I wake up feeling super depressed or really good, depending on the cycle. For me it’s 3 weeks depression, 1 week hypomanic. Taking a mood stabilizer and SNRI has helped a lot with that. BPD it’s reactive. Based on any number of events, feelings, thoughts, relationships."
BorderlinePDisorder,fpzvrxi,t3_gg439n,1589024397.0,"I originally learned DBT using the skills handouts and worksheets in group. I like them, I’m not sure they’re the most user friendly for applying the skills to real life.

Fat women need clothes and have money to buy them. I’m not claiming it’s wrong for brands to make clothes exclusively for skinny people, but it sure seems like a stupid business decision. 

And I also think fat women deserve a larger range of clothes that are offered by more retailers. At this point, what exactly is the issue with that? I just don’t get it. Americans are fat, make clothes for them and make money yourself.

If she was anyone else but a mod you guys would have said “if you can’t be nice then leave” and locked the comment thread. And maybe a ban for arguing with you. You can twist it any way you like but there’s obviously hypocrisy here. When you say “you’re uneducated” and “your beliefs are based on ignorance” that’s insulting someone.

I knew I said mean things to myself but wow, after reading my thoughts I am really, really nasty to myself. And being that critical and judgmental to myself results in doing the same to others. I’ve been using a technique from a DBT workbook called thought defusion that’s supposed to put some space between our thoughts and ourselves. I imagine my thoughts leaving my head as clouds and when they reach the sky they evaporate. The self-affirming statement I’m focusing on today is “I embrace both my good and bad qualities.” 

Has radical acceptance helped at all? That skill helps me be less irritable with others and myself because it avoids the “shoulds.”

I’ve completed a DBT course where we used the Linehan handouts and worksheets. I love the workbook you linked, more than the Linehan book.

Basically sit quietly and notice what’s happening in your body, mind and around you. Just notice, don’t judge, don’t try to change it, don’t hold onto it, don’t push it away. Let it be. Is your neck tight? What emotions are you feeling? Any thoughts that come just note them and let them go. 

I think a guided body scan meditation is a great place to start. One of the techniques we learned in group for distracting thoughts is to imagine a conveyor belt in your mind. Then all your thoughts are placed on a conveyor and go into a bucket. This is especially useful when trying to sleep."

If you’re not aware DBT is the main treatment for BPD. Also helps depression and anxiety. I would definitely look for resources in your area.

dbtselfhelp,fpecysd,t3_gcoi29,1588545063.0,"This reminds me of my family. Dismissed when I try to bring something up calmly which resulted in anger outbursts to be taken seriously. 

I’ll tell you what I’ve done that’s worked. I’ve found that instead of reacting in anger, which is what they want, just say “I’m not having a conversation you while you’re speaking to me like that.” And walk away. They’ll probably be dumbfounded. What? They’re not going to scream at me back? It’s a great feeling. Repeat it until they stop. Could take a long time. 

And for your demands, calmly tell them over and over again until they’re sick of it. For example I had a family member bring up other family members often and because of my relationship with them it was very painful. Every time that family member brought it up I’d say “I don’t want to hear about their lives or discuss them at all, it’s painful and hurtful.” And this family member would say in exasperation, “but they’re my family, I can’t just not talk about them!” So, every time I would express how painful it was and to talk about them to literally anyone else but me.” Took 10+ times and it still happens but the expectation is there that I will protect my feelings even if this person could care less about them. I don’t usually tell people they can’t talk about things with me, it’s like a punch in the gut whenever they mention them. 

I hope that’s helpful, I’m still working on interpersonal effectiveness. Basically, we teach others how to treat us and sometimes they need to be re-trained.

I’ve been using my DBT skills. Being mindful of my breathing and how I’m feeling. I’ve been taking deep breaths and accepting the situation. It’s already happened and I can’t control that. Using opposite action- so I’m acting calm, not angry and not stressed. To regulate the emotion. 

I’m still stressed about money. I haven’t eaten or taken my meds today so I’m going to do that now. Will most likely meditate, yoga or walk. 

I’m thinking about how much this will bother me in a day, a week, a year. About similar times and how I moved past them. 

A bunch of DBT, not sure if you’re familiar with the skills. Overall to help you- accept what you can’t control, breathe through it, self care, know that this too shall pass.

BPD also has highs and lows. That’s what my therapist said too. Bipolar has the cycles. It’s difficult for me to distinguish between the two but it seems like BPD ups and downs are usually in reaction to events/people in my life where bipolar is I wake up feeling great or awful.

Don’t let that discourage you though. The best part about being in a DBT group is hearing how your group members are using DBT and learning from them. I remember when I started that it was very overwhelming but it clicks after a while.

Talk to your doctor about weight gain concerns? I had a lot of side effects when starting all of these meds. Nausea, I would throw up sometimes, dizziness, hot flashes. They all went away over time and I have none of those now. 

I think it’s about trying them for at least 6 weeks (without major side effects of course) and then consider getting off them."

BPD,foc2si3,t3_g6nm72,1587666463.0,"In the past I’ve covered the cameras on my iPad and laptop with stickers. Cause someone could hack them and view me at my worst. Idk, seems paranoid now. IM sure this is somewhat common."
BPD,foc1j30,t3_g6r07t,1587666070.0,"I have to tell you, this post worries me. Because it reminds me of myself before things got really bad. You can’t just stop taking the Zoloft, start taking it again immediately. If your boyfriend ever called the police (or someone else does) and you admitted you broke his expensive things because you were angry they will charge you with domestic violence. It doesn’t take much at all. If you hit him with your fist they’ll charge you with assault and your fist is a weapon. And in many states it’s a mandatory arrest. 

I am sorry you’re going through this, I know it comes from pain. You have to deal with it before it gets worse. Get back on your meds, try others/a new one if you need to. Go to therapy, look into DBT. You can use the DBT skills to deal with the emotions instead of breaking things."
BPD,fo3s4zf,t3_g5ewzn,1587492051.0,I think it’s understandable to have trouble working with the public with everything going on. Do you have to work or can you take time off?
BPD,fnu8g18,t3_g3y0je,1587256703.0,"I don’t slut shame. As long as you’re being safe, and it sounds like you are, go for it. 

I never talked to my dad about sex so I’m not sure how to answer that one. I would avoid the topic with him. Also condoms are not useless, don’t listen to that nonsense."
BPD,fnt3zm1,t1_fnswi3j,1587234173.0,I also went through a few diagnoses before being diagnosed with BPD and Bipolar at 29. Seems like we kinda have to diagnose ourselves. Once I realized I had BPD it only took a few sessions for a therapist to diagnose me.
BPD,fnt2pob,t3_g3n49e,1587233476.0,Do you like any tv shows or games? They might be a good way to distract yourself.
BPD,fnpp3bf,t3_g1x91y,1587149416.0,"For whatever reason I don’t use this skill that much. Or I use it in my own way, which I don’t know if that’s the right way to use this skill. 

Contributing- I like to go through this sub and respond to new posts and be encouraging. I feel like it adds to my life and values. 

Comparisons- I compare to where I was a year ago and didn’t have DBT to help me cope. Or meds lol. 

Emotions- watch stand up comedy when I want to laugh. 

Pushing away thoughts- I use this as a way to stop ruminating and go back to the present. I have a tendency to ruminate over past events that result in me feeling bad. So I say to myself nope I’m not obsessing over that I’m in the present. 

I use these often though and I thought we’re not supposed to use distress tolerance skills often."
BPD,fnpoc6b,t3_g2dr3f,1587149032.0,"What I find so interesting about this skill is that it depends on how much a person lives in emotion mind vs rational mind. For me I live in emotion mind. So I notice when I’m all about the emotions and then add in the rational part while still validating my emotions. When I cope ahead being in wise mind is very helpful. 

Thank you for creating these posts, I love it!"
BPD,fnpo2t2,t1_fnobzy5,1587148903.0,"I like this about DBT- we can use the skills that work best for us. I have my favorite skills and other skills I don’t use as often. 

Just based on your WM response I would say add validating your emotions to that. Maybe something like this:

WM: I am feeling abandonment and that’s valid. I can’t prove that I’m being abandoned with facts. They might be busy, I’m going to wait and see because wise mind tells me they will most likely text back. In the meantime I am going to use coping skills to deal with my abandonment while I wait. 

Yeah? I hope this isn’t too much, writing this out helps me apply the skills in my life."
BPD,fnllsn4,t1_fnl2hne,1587055722.0,"I think at one point in my life the anger was necessary as a way to keep me safe. Now it’s not necessary or effective. Usually the anger is masking another emotion such as hurt or fear. 

For me personally, there are a lot of behavioral and thinking patterns that lead me to have anger outbursts. And I’m working on identifying what those are to change those reactions. Or respond instead of reacting. 

It’s still hard for me not to react in anger when people are insulting or treating me in a way that feels unfair. What’s helped is realizing that they are not acting this way just because I am wrong in some way or less than them. It’s about them, not me. I can’t control other people, only myself. Accepting people for who they are and what they do. What I can do is set boundaries and show them how to treat me or I won’t be in their life. I have a family member who has screamed at me in anger in the past. Instead of screaming back I just say I’m not doing this with you and it is not ok to speak to me that way. And over time this person has stopped that behavior."
BPD,fnho96t,t1_fnhm3o2,1586965970.0,"Major anger/mood problems. An inability to get along with others in general- personal, work. With few exceptions. Major road rage. It’s gotten a little better but still a struggle. I’ll be 30 in May so it hasn’t been super long. 

Major depression, like at times sobbing in the fetal position in intense pain. That has gotten immensely better. 

Impulsiveness and destructive behavior. Black and white thinking, abandonment issues.

Self harm- when I was in an abusive relationship I would slam my head against the wall and punch myself. 

Wow. It’s interesting writing this out and seeing how far I’ve come. Things are immensely better now. It’s kind of hard to think of that time because it was not good.

BPD,fnhleu7,t3_g1t8vj,1586964547.0,Yup I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety until the age of 29 when I was diagnosed with bipolar and BPD. The symptoms of bipolar and BPD got increasingly worse until I could no longer hide them.

BPD,fnhk6dx,t3_g1sd52,1586963910.0,"The r/DBTselfhelp wiki has an awesome list of DBT resources. 

I highly recommend the Skillful Podcast. It’s lead by two psychotherapists who give personal examples of how they use the skills.

dbtselfhelp,fn9qjgy,t3_g0hird,1586781961.0,"Radical acceptance of the breakup but also your feelings of grief and sadness. I would have to go no contact but that’s me personally.

Since you are feeling a high amount of distress this is probably a good time for self soothing, pleasurable activities and distraction. ACCEPTS and IMPROVE. 

I would recommend journaling or writing emails/letters to him that you’ll never send him. To get all those thoughts and feelings out of your head. 

Breakups suck and it’ll probably be painful for a long time and it will get better. Remember a time in the past when you’ve felt this way and how you felt better with time."
BPD,fn86iq1,t3_fzzk3m,1586734956.0,"Radical acceptance is one of my favorite skills. I feel like it’s gotten rid of any road rage I’ve had. I can’t control other people so I accept that they’re going to do what they’re going to do and not accepting that creates suffering. The only person I can control is myself. I love the feeling of peace and realization that comes with this skill. If I’m driving and someone cuts me off then I accept it. I don’t go into that person is such a jerk and they did that on purpose! It is what it is. I think check the facts is also very useful, especially when used with this skill. 

With covid-19 I’ve accepted that it’s happening and that I won’t know how long I’ll be stuck in the house. This actually isn’t very different from my normal life but I miss going to the gym and being able to do things. And I fear family members dying. I accept that I don’t know if that’ll happen and all we can do is try to be safe."
BPD,fn85gj8,t3_g01p43,1586734305.0,"I am also bipolar but I’m now on 150mg lamictal, 60mg Cymbalta and 30mg buspar twice a day. If I don’t take them on time I definitely notice. They’ve helped my depression, anger and I’m generally more stable with my emotions. DBT has also helped a lot. 

Previously I was on Zoloft and wellbutrin which didn’t help nearly as much. 

Also getting one of those med wheels with the weekdays on them has helped immensely with taking my meds on time everyday."

BPD,fn3bol8,t1_fn2c7r9,1586617363.0,"I know what you mean about keeping score. I do think it’s a balance in relationships, doing nice things for each other. But when people start expecting a big show for every nice thing they do it gets to be too much. I think reciprocating at some point and a thank you I appreciate you is enough. Some people seem to expect groveling. It’s not fun to have someone observing you and criticizing your behavior. Especially when you’re working on yourself."
BPD,fn2721v,t3_fyw4be,1586579655.0,"I read it! I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way, you deserve to feel good.

BPD,fn21s6x,t1_fn10tcd,1586575593.0,There’s a lot of grey area between being entirely optimistic and entirely pessimistic. DBT has helped me find that middle path.
BPD,fn0ihkr,t3_fyip0e,1586542551.0,"I struggle with the same issues and I would recommend Schema Therapy. Here’s the definition of a schema:

In schema therapy, a schema specifically refers to an early maladaptive schema, defined as a pervasive self-defeating or dysfunctional theme or pattern of memories, emotions, and physical sensations, developed during childhood or adolescence and elaborated throughout one's lifetime. 

Basically we repeat the same patterns we learned in childhood. There’s several schemas that could contribute to a lack of motivation. I’m working on the schemas myself and meeting goals/creating habits. For example one of my schemas is failure. I figure I’m a failure so what’s the point. Which reinforces that feeling of failure and repeats the pattern. 

Make really small goals and work on building them from there. For me it’s things like working a certain amount, studying for a certain amount, meeting basic hygiene, cleaning my area, meditating. I don’t meet all my goals but I figure as long as I’m trying it’ll come with time. 

I don’t think there’s any right answer to this question. Could me meds, therapy, life coach (not sure I believe in that last one). Just have to try and try and see what works. I also think the way we talk to ourselves effects our motivation. I’ll call myself a loser but that doesn’t make me feel good and meet goals. So instead I say I’ve had major struggles in my life and it’s going to take time to get to a good place. As long as I’m trying that’s all that matters. Like in DBT they say I’m doing the best I can and I can do better."

BPD,flt4xqf,t3_fqwme1,1585459380.0,"I haven’t been doing DBT for 5 years yet but this was exactly my reaction to my therapist. 

I found myself saying, yes DBT is great for coping but what about all this trauma that keeps popping up. I stopped seeing my DBT therapist because after bringing that up several times in session it wasn’t addressed. There were many other reasons I stopped seeing her, as a DBT therapist she was judgmental and made assumptions. It’s frustrating learning DBT from someone who obviously doesn’t use it in their daily life. And after 6-8 sessions she was frustrated that I kept having “setbacks.” Tired of being told to radically accept it and find meaning from it. I have accepted it and learned from it. Radical acceptance is one of my favorite skills- it doesn’t get rid of the reactions I have to trauma. When I’m in crisis the only skills I use are STOP and TIPP. Then I can use the other skills. 

Since I realized I still had all these reactions from trauma I’ve looked into EMDR and Schema Therapy. I’ve had trouble finding things in my area. I got the book on Schema therapy from Amazon and I have found it helpful and also overwhelming. I wish I had someone to walk me through it. EMDR I’ve been using a video to do myself.

But anyways, it’s nice to read an experience about DBT that is similar to mine. I like DBT and use it daily but have gotten tired of the everyone bow down to DBT and never criticize it, if it’s not working for you then you’re not doing it right mentality."
