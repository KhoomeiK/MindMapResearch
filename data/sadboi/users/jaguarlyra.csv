It's been quite a few days since our major exposure to him. The positive from this is that he was only in the ICU 2ish days and is well on his way to recovery at 85. Please make dua my Grandma doesn't have to leave the hospital until he is no longer contagious and can go to the bathroom by herself without help. A big positive this week my Mom got a new job that is less then 10 minutes away. A story about my favorite characters cuddling is being published currently and I am very excited to see when the cuddling starts. She's releasing one chapter a day.

Hijabis,fnkytii,t3_g2bqc8,1587043341.0,I was there for a long time . What kept me going throughout was making a dua along the line of God when it best for my soul please let me die. It kept me going along with the warnings of the punishment of those who commit suicide. It can get better though I was trapped in a bed barely able to move drink little and sleeping so much. But it got better I no longer want to die and haven't for years. Allah swt tests us all. Hold on to Islam it will make the pain less and more manageable. Make dua constantly you get to ask Allah for help so easily and it takes weight off your shoulders. Many hugs and I hope this has been helpful.
