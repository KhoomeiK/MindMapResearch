FTMMen,fp58dr4,t3_gb93v1,1588319888.0,"Speaking from personal experience, one issue I had to unravel was to understand that I was glorifying hook up culture in my head. I think Gen Z at least, not just in gay culture (I'm straight), generally glorifies casual sex. While I agree that it is something fun, it can also be very toxic, which did get to my head and made my dysphoria go out of control. Youtuber Tiffany Ferg made a pretty good video on it if anyone wants to see it in detail. Personally, it became toxic when I saw having tons of casual sex would make me the 'masculine ideal' that I wanted to be.

I'm definitely not pointing fingers here, but I think it is important for us to think about too, especially in relation to gender dysphoria."

Scary surgeries and whatnot portrayed by the media makes me feel isolated as a trans person, perhaps I have some internalised stigma against myself but it definitely helps seeing other transmen exist. Thank you for responding. I definitely feels better hearing someone else who actually had surgery say its not as invasive as I think it is. How was your recovery?

Similar to another comment, is there a need to keep ovaries in? I hear that some transmen also get more changes after hysto because estrogen might’ve been blocking stuff."

As much as I desire all the changes I can get while on T, I think I’m concerned about my mood changes from starting T, and would be stressing out about whether if I pass or not. Frankly I have doubts, not because of the changes, but whether if my transition would go smoothly without the potential complications that it may bring, even if its rare or does not have sufficient research. Its a lifelong decision after all, just scares me a bit because of that fact."
FTMMen,fbgcy09,t1_fbga87s,1576845323.0,"Is that at the start of your freshman year? I believe my college has that option too, it seems like a good in-between option between gap year or no gap to me.

Like you, I just want some changes that makes me more comfortable with myself, and hopefully pass more. But as changes are different for everyone idk how long that will take me.

I think I have an irrational FOMO feeling with being on a gap year. I don’t want to feel as if I’m behind everyone else."
FTMMen,fbg7xwq,t1_fbg7dd7,1576839035.0,"Thank you for the insight, and congrats on your top surgery!

Regarding trans clinics, I believe the city I will be moving to will have a lot more than the current one I’m in. Luckily I won’t have to worry about that too much. I’m actually more worried about how I’d access T in a different country while moving.

My main concern with my gap year is what I’d be doing other than transitioning. I definitely do want to get a job, but I’m afraid of any discrimination I’d face as my official records obviously do not match my preffered name and gender expression. What did you do during your year off?"

Its very easy to let someone influence what you think you are when you're at such a vulnerable place like this. Whether if you end up identifying with transmasc, bigendr, nonbinary or anything, it is okay to be yourself. While you are right about not having reddit people tell you (impossible anyways, since you're the one who knows yourself), you ask when you would know. From my experience, gender identity and expression is something to explore. I have found things about myself long after I identified as a transman, which would probably have been seen if I weren't so scared of change. You may realise one label or one thing actually makes you dysphroic down the line, or vice versa. This is something that takes time, and remember that being yourself is okay, and change happens."
