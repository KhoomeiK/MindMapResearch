BipolarReddit,fnok3uk,t3_g27qml,1587127276.0,"My experience with bipolar is almost exactly like yours.

 I described that electric feeling to my therapist with a loud buzzing or sometimes a humm. I had my first full blown manic episode in December of last year. The electricity got overwhelming and I started having uncontrollable anxiety, my moods were all over the place and extremely intense. It led to a months long drinking binge and a developing benzodiazepine addiction. 

My moods also have the strongest shift from summer/fall and winter/ spring. I was diagnosed BP1 after I got out of the psych hospital following that first manic episode. Now I'm on a mood stabilizer, an atypical antipsychotic, and an antidepressant that I am currently tapering off of to replace with Strattera for ADHD. The electricity is finally gone. The deep depression that usually comes after the high was sharply minimized by the new meds and I no longer drink alcohol at all. 

I feel pretty good for the most part these days. Just wanted you to know that I absolutely relate to exactly how you described your experience so you would know you are not alone in the world.

Edit: I forgot to add that I still experience the sensory overload at times."
