BorderlinePDisorder,ewv3s69,t3_cqavs2,1565798010.0,"Hey :)
I think it is absolutely normal, not everyone has the same symptoms, shares the same experiences, and so on.
And i think symptoms can also change over the time, as you are changing in your personality over the years.
I was diagnosed around 15 years ago, and had never had ANY rage or anger issues - until the last relationship i was in. Since then, my rage and anger have gradually built up everytime i'm in a stressful situation.
That doesn't mean you WILL have to do with those symptoms - but it could be possible that your BPD and its symptoms change over time."

The most of us do these things cause we never learned to cope with stress or trouble in a different, ""healthy"" way. Due to our illness we never learned to act different.
Thank you for not seeing BPD people as black and white, and thanks for explaining that that kind of behaviour is blaming and hurting us."
