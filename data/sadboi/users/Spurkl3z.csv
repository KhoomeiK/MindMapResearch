also i have a ton to say about your jump to designer babies and eradication but i dont think ill be able to keep that convo civil so if you dont mind, ill pass. just that id not want to do anything with anyone that would even consider designing a baby. its fundamentally wrong. 

and no, i simply dont agree. i hope you realise that exclusionism is not at all inherently part of transmedicalism. transmedicalism is simply recognizing the medical basis of being trans (and nb for that matter), and is something the world seriously needs more of right now. individuals who take medicalism too far are shunned even by other medicalists. but tucute ideology is undoing trans acceptance and literally replaces trans people in their own communities. thats something i find weird to support."

everyone needs personal meaning, its literally an antidote to apathy nihilism and depression 

for me personally, i wish to one day generate helpful knowledge in a few psychology parts ofthe world, to help people help themselves. find meaning in something and keep interacting with the world, try to keep a full plate most days, find things you enjoy even if only to talk about, i believe things will turn out allright for you.

depression,f1p7a5r,t3_daenaj,1569674050.0,"please remember that you can get better

in this world you have to do things yourself, but you dont have to do it (frankly, humans can not function) alone. allowing yourself to feel connected makes life so much better 

youre not being a nuisance or a burden if you let some of your thoughts out to a friend, this is literally depression screwing with your brain. i always thought this too but now i dont get how i thought thinking this way was reasonable 

there are many ways you can councel yourself to feeling better. for me personally psilocybin truffles and periods of trying to meditate regularly (ended up with once every few days, but it still helps) helped tremendously with my mental health, and i went out more and talked more with family and friends which also contributed lots 

i hope you get less depressed soon
