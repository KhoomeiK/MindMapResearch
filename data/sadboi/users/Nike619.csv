Love your skins! But I do have one request - Is there any chance you could start working towards higher resolution skins? I'm running 4K for screenshots and you can see some stenciling  problems etc. If not, no worries I just think you make a ton of skins and a solid HR base would really put them over the top. 

If you haven't yet - a super shiny mustang like Miss Kandy would be a hell of an addition to your hanger.
