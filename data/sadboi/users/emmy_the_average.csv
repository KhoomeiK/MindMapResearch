loseit,fqrr94d,t1_fqqr8ni,1589590206.0,I have never heard this saying before but it struck me hard. This is my new mantra. Thank you!

You're doing a great thing by trying to learn about this, most people wouldn't even go this far. She is so lucky to have someone like you who puts effort in to understanding. 

If I were her and I read what you wrote, I would feel so much appreciation."

But seriously you are awesome thank you!"
VeganFoodPorn,fmggq3x,t3_fv2mr4,1586048668.0,All of that looks so delicious and you're a superb human  for doing all that!

beauty,fm2tde4,t1_fm1v04u,1585704980.0,"I second this and came here to say the same! Last year at this time I had no nails at all, not I have to keep filing them, they're so long. I love love love Peppi Gel!"
nutrition,fm0j299,t1_fm0heqm,1585659123.0,"Same! I started restricting sparkling water to the end of the day when I would usually have cracked open a beer and now it's water that I am craving when I'm done with work, not beer. The amount of weight I've lost by limiting beer to weekends only and drinking sparkling water during the week is shocking and slightly embarrassing lol"
running,fm0gr7z,t1_fm09enm,1585657267.0,"I'm definitely having this issue, too! 

Where on your ankles is it painful? I've researched a little and identifying whether the pain is on the back, sides etc could give you more answers. For example, I learned I wasn't lacing my shoes for proper support and that I have flat feet. Definitely keep stretching but also look up some ankle strengthening exercises as well!

I am not an expert and I'm really hoping some magic running expert comes here to help us with some pro insight!"
AnorexiaNervosa,flrfcus,t3_fqkx7l,1585419048.0,"Um this was me last week when I tried taking ACV for the first time ever but I took it undiluted. Figured since I liked the flavor, why dilute it? I know now."
EDanonymemes,flqmrsv,t1_flq59tf,1585400378.0,"Yes, it's so true you can't forget the number of calories you've memorized.  Even when I deleted the app, every time I looked at any food I would start calculating the calories; the app had downloaded to my brain."
EatingDisorders,flnihcj,t1_flnb162,1585319305.0,"The seaweed chips help a lot too! It's definitely the salty, crunchy aspect that I always crave. Usually I'll eat carrots or cucumbers with some everything bagel seasoning and that holds me off for a bit. I actually hate sweets thank God; if I craved both all the time I'd be done for. 

You're right though, I should definitely try to make kale chips!!"
EatingDisorders,fln5im9,t1_flmvtzg,1585309786.0,"I second all of this but especially the walking. I wanted chips yesterday so I went for a walk and seriously focused on why I wanted them. I even thought to myself that I already know how they taste so why bother? I walked until I didn't feel like chips anymore then I had a nice long bath. 

But I definitely fall prey to the snacks at home often. I try to portion it out and put the bag away which sometimes helps. It's crazy what a mental game bingeing is, makes me feel so weak."
intermittentfasting,fl2bvba,t3_fm39yq,1584747460.0,"More than just progress, an inspiration! Good for you!"
EatingDisorders,fkyvzzv,t3_fl8om4,1584657323.0,"I am on my second Paragard IUD. It's the hormone-free copper one which lasts for ten years. It never made me gain weight or break out since it's hormone-free. A common side effect is that shark week can be heavier for some, so I make sure to take iron supplements. It did make me experience cramping for the first time (I had previously never had an issue with this until I got it) BUT it's not with every period for me. Some months will be rough while other times I feel nothing. I never have to think about it other than checking for the strings once a month. I absolutely love it."
