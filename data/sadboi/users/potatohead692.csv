I know depression is so fucking painful that it feels like you can't stand another second of it, and it feels like it's been going on forever. But your life actually won't look like it does now for nearly as long as it feels like it will. You will receive treatment and you will feel better, it's just a matter of surviving and keeping things together until you get there. 

Also, the way you feel about yourself does not reflect facts, it reflects a pathological illness. Low self esteem isn't your fault and you don't deserve it, and when you receive treatment and have the depression blanket lifted off of you, you WILL see yourself for who you really are and it's beautiful. Take care of yourselfðŸ’“ðŸ’“ and harass your parents as much as it takes to get the help you need!"

I love that tip about forcing yourself to imagine the best outcome because honestly, that's so much more constructive than obsessing over the worst thing that could happen. I like how you sort out which maladaptive thoughts just need to be vented and which ones should be brought up in therapy!! Limits on drinking and drug use are important too!!"
mentalhealth,ew41kf6,t1_esmf68z,1565100645.0,That's great honestly. Social connection is so important but it's hard when those connections come with their own burdens
mentalhealth,ew41ics,t1_esmg010,1565100605.0,"Great self care!! It can be annoying to be a student surrounded by peers who boast about pulling all nighters and pushing themselves to the limit of sleep deprivation when for us, doing that kind of thing could trigger an episode. But health has to be the priority!!"

It wasn't that she came up with a completely unique idea or anything, she just phrased it well and that's what makes it special. Kind of like how a poem can tell a love story you've seen a million times, it can still be impactful to read if the word choice is insightful."
