Adoption,fqxt6zx,t3_glisud,1589737470.0,"Pediatric nurse here! I love all of your pros. Finding a diverse office is challenging enough, so this is huge! Do you mind sharing the age of the child you are adopting? Maybe they don't have much experience with adoptees but will over time, so if the child is an infant you can have time discuss those concerns / spread awareness. 


As far as reviews, reviews specifically about how doctors manage adoptees is a pretty specific thing to look for, as in someone writing the review may not think to highlight this, instead just highlighting whether the experience was good or bad without sharing patient information. They may leave this detail out for the child's privacy or for safety reasons. What language was used in that practice that you found bothersome? 

Another option to expand your search a little bit is look at nurse practitioners in your area. They are also primary care providers and will only defer to an MD/DO if they need a specialist for something. This just adds more people to your list for consideration. 

I do think sending them adoption resources before giving them a chance to treat an adopted child would come off as passive aggressive, though during appointments (again especially if this child is younger) have an open conversation with your provider. During that you can let them know of resources you've found and are willing to share with them. I'd be surprised if they said no, most of us in healthcare are always looking for ways to grow. 😊

I hope this helps! Feel free to ask questions!"

Hyperbilirubinemia for phototherapy, failure to thrive and starting feeding plans, NAS, hypoglycemia, temperature regulation issues, etc all come to my floor. That's just our NICU-ish admissions and doesn't account for other sick babies that come in (meningitis, septic rule out, RSV/bronchiolitis, intususception, surgical or other). Because of this, we seem to have an easier time when we float to NICU to help out than L&D, and we definitely see more peds to NICU transitions. The pro to being L&D is being part of that initial delivery and stabilization of the newborn until NICU arrives, and that's an awesome experience. I hope this helps!

That program lost their accreditation when I was about halfway through. The previous two cohorts had appalling NCLEX pass rates and they didn't have anything to show the board for improvements.

I transferred to the local community college and LOVED it. Excellent professors, small class setting, diverse classroom with people of all ages, it was wonderful. I had no problem getting a job (this definitely may be dependent on where you live though) and I'm now two classes away from finishing my BSN online.

Go with the program that is tried and true. Go where you know you will get a strong foundation for starting your career, have support, and good clinical experiences. 

I hope this help! Please feel free to ask any questions you may have. Congrats on your acceptance to both programs!"
Nurse,foz3t7o,t3_gaazcr,1588184211.0,"My dad was on hospice after a long battle with cancer. As a child I always knew I wanted to grow up to be someone who helps people, I just didn'tcircle  know what that would look like yet. I was 14 at the time and my dad's nurse came over to the house and I was helping her take care of him. She looked me in the eye and said ""You're going to be a nurse someday, okay?"" And I said ""okay"" and that was that. I'm not a particularly spiritual or religious person, but I do believe that was a sign from the universe that this was what I was meant to do with my life. She was so sure that I was capable of doing this kind of work that she just came right out and told me to do it.

Nurse,fokv3u4,t3_g7uwse,1587849524.0,"Inpatient pediatrics. Thought I was having one of the worst nights. The child was relatively stable, but it was just little fire after little fire that needed to be out out, all. night. long. You all know exactly what kind of shift I'm talking about. 



Febrile. Wake child. Give Tylenol. Recheck temp. Still febrile. Assess IV before giving toradol. It's started to infiltrate. IV out, Morton given instead. BP taken, it's soft again, gotta wake kid up and restart IV, this kid needs fluids. Urine output is decreased. Okay, IV in. Crisis averted, now they can sleep. Call bell, asking for nurse, child vomiting. Bed bath given. Finally they can sleep. Call again, child has had diarrhea and is covered, so is the bed. Clean up again. Etc, etc, just one of those nights. 



I felt terrible for this family. The parents stood by and were supportive, but were quite newly immigrated to the United States and had limited English. For all I knew they hated my guts at that point. We were also having difficulty connecting with our stratus interpreters for whatever reason, so my communication and explanations to them were poor as well. I left feeling defeated and like they must have thought I was so annoying because I was constantly waking their child and nothing was going right. And as sick as this sweet toddler was, he was pleasant, smiling, and trying so hard to play with me even though he was exhausted. He loved to be held and cuddled after cares, even if I did things that hurt. This tiny little human offered such grace. He was definitely a reflection of his wonderfully pleasant, kind parents. 



They hand wrote me a card, poor spelling, grammar and all, expressing so much gratitude it still melts me. They responded with patience and understanding when many patients/parents would just be annoyed and asking to not re-stick/obtain vitals/ wake for meds etc. The card is still on my fridge. I'll probably never take it down."

relationships,foixmks,t3_g7mqs9,1587800515.0,"Hey! Adult child of two alcoholics, and my mother has significant mental health issues that contribute to her being emotionally abusive. Lots of great answers here already, but thought I'd chime in with a couple more things. 


First, you acknowledge how close you are with your siblings and how you all went through these things together. Me and my siblings have been anywhere from in contact, to limited contact, to no contact, and not always at the same time. Regardless, we've always been understanding of each other's choices in handling our relationship with our parents. If their experiences have been similar to yours, I'd be inclined to think they would be supportive of you distancing yourself. 


Others have brought up ""information diets"" and boundary setting. A technique I like to use is called ""medium chill"", one that allows contact but in a very non-intimate way: no personal info, nothing emotional. Very neutral way of communicating. I would encourage you to look this up and utilize these techniques to help you with your current living situation as well as navigating the limited contact you'll need to have with them to stay in touch with your siblings. 

Hope this helps, good luck!"

Nurse,fl85vqq,t1_fl85okf,1584916525.0,"They haven't offered FMLA yet, I wonder if that's the direction they will go. I'm not sure what else they will do. Positive cases are rolling in now, people will become sick at some point."
Nurse,fkszt0m,t1_fksxnzv,1584502391.0,"They are secret with no patient identifiers. So far the conversation has been very generalized, but management is still concerned. I've found it shocking the similarities we're all facing, especially regarding PPE."
nursing,fkq2cry,t1_fkpjnm5,1584427649.0,"Interesting, why? We've done the opposite. We still have nebulizers but our doctors want us using MDIs on the premise that children typically get more of their dose using an MDI. We'll do nebs when they're asleep at times but use the MDI whenever possible."
nursing,fkq236d,t1_fkpyrad,1584427348.0,Same! End of my shift I washed it down and gave it to the next nurse. Still waiting on more to come in.
nursing,fkq21x7,t1_fkpy9zk,1584427308.0,Yep. I thankfully had N95s yesterday while caring for two COVID rules outs (results pending) but was told by charge to take mine home since there might not be any masks left when I go in tomorrow. I never imagined that would be something we'd have to do.
Nurse,fkkw2xq,t3_fj19f4,1584293154.0,"If we get COVID-19 at work and we can reasonably prove that our exposure came from work, it's workers comp. If we catch it in the community or traveling, it's PTO. If we travel, we have to quarantine for 2 weeks and that's PTO."
Nightshift,fkemy7a,t1_fkdlyt9,1584116507.0,"The night time insomnia has been hitting me hard lately. Day sleep has surprisingly improved for me, night sleep just straight up doesn't happen. I'm hoping it's just a phase and I'll start sleeping at night again soon."
Nurse,fk8vou5,t3_fh4shw,1583963790.0,Haven't had a case yet but our plan is to keep them in negative pressure rooms on airborne precautions with PAPR and the whole getup. I've heard we maybe got a case so if anything changes I'll update.
nursepractitioner,fk8lgdp,t3_fgqw4p,1583958291.0,"Thank you for compiling this data, very interesting to see! Do you think this accurately portrays which states are struggling with NP shortages? Are these perhaps areas where there are more PAs/PA jobs instead? I'd love to hear more of your thoughts. Thanks again for sharing!"
raisedbyborderlines,fk86irn,t1_fk72gf3,1583950284.0,Came here to say this! My region has some income based programs that I used when I was without insurance. Hopefully OP has something similar near them!
Nightshift,fk34boi,t1_fk2ieea,1583817288.0,"Welcome to nights! This sub is super friendly and supportive, if you have questions while you adjust please bring them to us :)"
thesims,fjdyxc6,t1_fjdj7q9,1583261939.0,I make all my rooms first and decorate them and smush them together to make a house after and pretty it up if it's horrendous. I want to like outdoor decorating and landscaping I just don't have the vision!
AdultChildren,fj5wcs8,t1_fj5tc7q,1583045605.0,This is exactly what my brother thinks is going on. She had to have the power in the situation so SHE chose not to come before I could officially uninvite her. Spot on.
AdultChildren,fj4dmwm,t1_fj4cghq,1583005837.0,"Thank you so much for sharing. I am currently in therapy and working through this issue, I just haven't had an appointment since that message was sent. It's helpful to hear from someone that knows their parent both ways that they wouldn't have changed it. I appreciate your input.  🖤"
