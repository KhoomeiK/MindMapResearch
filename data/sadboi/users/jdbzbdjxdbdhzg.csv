Justrolledintotheshop,f23jwh1,t1_f2331ul,1569928321.0,Was lazy about my last oil change so I brought it into one of those 10m oil change spots. They tried to tell me my air filter was dirty and needed to be replaced. The same one I had changed the week prior.

ffxiv,et5wire,t1_et5rud0,1562493839.0,"Healing Doma Castle yesterday almost made me stop leveling my healer because of what a pain it was. GNB kept pulling big and I was barely able to keep him up the whole time. Then I ran it again with an FC group and it went fine, so I'm feeling a little better now. Didn't help that I think the only CD that GNB ever touched was his DPS CD."
ffxiv,et5wbsm,t3_c9z697,1562493521.0,"I often tank while my spouse heals. They've never been very comfortable with big pulls, but I'll still feel out 1-2 pulls to evaluate group DPS and will sometimes pull 2 groups at a time if the damage is good enough.

Anyway, flash back to a couple days ago. After the first pull one of the DPS started taunting me to pull more and called me a coward. Now, I had been prepped to pull more because our incoming and outgoing damage was fine, but instead we just opted to steadily pull one group at a time because of that guy. I was actually kind of surprised he didn't start pulling extra groups. 

Don't be that guy."
