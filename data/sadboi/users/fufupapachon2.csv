Open up more and more on the details of your relationship so the normalization process is taking place slowly but surely. First you need to work on the statement that you know what you are doing and you deserve respect and freedom. Bring your father to your support so your mom slowly realizes that she might not be right about her beliefs. Just be sensible about everything and dont engage to aggresivley. Everything should work out good.

Wish you a good romance!

If he has been hestitant to move forward is probably because he may be a really passionte person regarding sexuality. You see, for some the idea of just the smell of pleasure without the flavor is enough to drive them crazy. To work things up you may need to bring more commitment to the table and be more brave. Moving to live with him might be the solution. A risky maneuver perhaps. But little amazing things have taken place while playing safe, so its up to you."

Basically you will not only have to convince him that life is worth it  but be strong enough to support him emotionaly. All the confusion he may have. You need to get to the bottom of it and show him the right path.

Listen, being sensible and passionate its a good thing, definatley. But you need to be careful on who you choose on giving your heart to. Broken souls are no joke.

You may need some time to get over him, maybe not. The thing is that you need to understand he isnt worth the effort. Not a single dime of your time. So if you are going to spend tears on somebody, do it with someone that deserves it."

The natural response on a high fidelity status is to get disgusted by such an aproach of other man to you. Even having such a picture in your phone means he is ""that"" kind of guy.

Its clear you still have the scar of your previous relationship which is the reason you feel instinctively inclined to those mistake. 

You are not complete nor healed. I would go as far as to say you dont feel compmetley comfortable by yourself, hence why you become clingy.

The thing about relationships, if your are not at your best chape you will start to drag your partner down. A higher demand process will begin and you will neglect the giving aspect of the relationship.

He is most likley insecure about his stuttering condition. He needs as much support as you may demand. You need to find peace with yourself and understand that to him you are worthy as you are. Leave your past behind or it will end up opposing your future happiness.

Ok, i will keep up reading the post to see what else i can say. Brb.

Yeah, he is insecure, clear as day. Just dont be insensitive and sproud it on his face. You need to embrace the supportive role. Like, its ok wanting money but just demanding it from him is a bad play. The proper thing to do is give encouragment so he can overcome obstacles and become the man you want.

She might have some scar regarding commitment. Instinctively she might feel afraid of trusting somebody. Maybe from a past experience or maybe just that's the way she was born. 

Don't rush things. Don't force commitment. Make her feel at ease with your text game. Allow her to open up little by little. Every time she does something you conclude its worthy of praise, give it to her but in a mild way, always in context. Don't just throw random compliments and expect them to stick or work.

When in person. If you lock gazes throw a smile at her but don't engage. After a while you can get more adventurous and throw a hand wave. Try being in her presence for extended periods of time but without interactions. Use an excuse like some activity she might be interested in but don't make it obvious.

For some this is extremely complicated due to the fact they might present qualities to abstract for common people to enjoy. Or have to high of expectations and lack of qualities for a successful seduction. 

Another difficulty comes after you understand what you want and what you could offer. Logistics can be an obstacle due to lack of understanding of where to find the aspiring romantic interest.

Knowing yourself its the first step. Once you do, you should be perfectly aware what you are looking for to maximize the opportunities of finding a partner with the expected characteristics.

The third step its seduction. Understanding your target its key to devise the more effective approach. Some like it aggressive, others passive. Some like it shy and awkward, while others passionate and extroverted.

At the end the purpose its not to succeed, but rather doing it in the right conditions. 

By being yourself you will be able to work more efficiently towards the core element of Chemistry and genuine bonding. Don't play pretend or lie your way into success since you might end in a unsatisfying relationship."

Work on your personality to see results."

Don't go to war unprepared and without a plan. The key its to find a balance between giving her freedom and presenting yourself in an appealing way to conquer her heart. A confession at the end of the day works as an ultimatum, its either yes or no. Rather you should aim to keep dancing for as many nights until the promised sunrise flourish."

Your demands are justified, your boyfriend responses are not. 

We live and die for happiness. Take this aspect of your life more seriously because that's exactly what your boyfriend its trying to do.

In a healthy relationship your bf behavior should be irrational. There should be no need to explore other options and befriending woman who find him attractive. You don't indulge in this ideas and this is the prominent thing to consider. The imbalance in the relationship its evident. 

When soul mates clash their gazes and fates, troubles and worries are reduce to fiction. It's important for you to understand this since by staying with him you are preventing yourself to be happier."
relationship_advice,f8a4wig,t3_dzty5v,1574387816.0,"The mature way of solving an issue in a successful relationship its the exact opposite of what your bf is doing. If he is hurting you because of pride and he refuses to open up you can always find love that will treat you like you deserve. If he refuses tu mature he is not the one hurting you, rather you are doing it to yourself by submitting to him."
relationship_advice,f8a43di,t1_f8a1s0t,1574387197.0,"Send her a message, it might be the proper approach. Just don't criticize her behavior, don't hurt her feelings. Just tell her you don't feel comfortable allowing her to cheat. After sending it, avoid talking to her to prevent being persuaded or manipulated. If she truly consider herself as your friend, she will understand and will present a desire to keep interacting with you. If she gets offended and cuts ties with you, then this ""friendship"" isn't worth the effort."
relationship_advice,f8a17di,t3_dzt3jf,1574384995.0,"Ok, i won't even bother to read the whole thing. The first 2 paragraphs were enough. I need to tell you what you need to know, reality can be harsh though. Its toxic. This is not how a relationship should play out. This is not true love but a depravity of the idea. A true lover will accept you with every flaw you present along the way. True love doesn't betray but supports. Letting go of the bittersweet connection you have can be rough. Being alone its rough. But the prospect of a better relationship lies beyond your present if you are brave enough. If you keep this going she might find a proper replacement for you and leave you to drown in deep waters. I'm not sorry to tell you this, but its time for a breakup.

Edit: Ok...I didn't want to do it but i couldn't help it. I read the whole thing.

relationship_advice,f8a0mmf,t3_dzt3ko,1574384540.0,"Stop with this behavior. What you are feeling right now its the proper response. The honorable one, if i may. If you start thinking nothing of it your morality will take a hit. Nobility its of great value in relationships, don't jeopardize it. Control your instincts and be firm with your friend. What she is doing its not right by any means. This sort of behavior leaves a big scar on those who deal with the betray. 

I trust you will choose the right thing."
relationship_advice,f8a0406,t3_dzt3sy,1574384131.0,"Be sincere to him. Love essential pillar its trust and mutual support. Be open about how you feel or fear will destroy you and what you hold dear. Discuss possible solutions to your problems in the relationship. Allow yourself to be vulnerable so he has the chance to comfort you and strengthen your bond. Believe in yourself even if you don't feel beautiful enough. Evereybody has their own shade of beauty through the right lens. Let him see who you really are, thus giving the chance for true love to blossom.

 Just believe."

You were dealt a bad hand in life but this will make you strong if you keep your eyes in the shine of the horizon. There are or will be people that will support you and make you happy, simply because you deserve it. Never give up. Never forget about hope. At the end everything you went through will be worth it.

Sorry, i i will read your post and comment later.

Edit: Typo."
offmychest,f84eegh,t1_f83w2vo,1574244086.0,"Exactly, thats what i was doing. Bending the possibility of failing to save a life. A pet its of small importance in comparison. Although it can always come down to subjectivity."
offmychest,f84e95p,t1_f83xs3r,1574243858.0,Well the good thing its that as individuals differ from one another each develops its own way of supporting their peers and people tend to answer better to specific styles of advice or charitable words. At the end it might not matter your approach as long you are genuine and of positive outlook.
offmychest,f84e232,t1_f83wccn,1574243544.0,Have you considered training your children to be professional food critiques/judges or even chefs themselfes? My instincts tells me they have a lot of potential and starting learning a discipline at a young age its of immeasurable value.
offmychest,f83y96s,t3_dyw9ky,1574224363.0,"Lol, really? You will give up the opportunity to be happy and to make someone happy just because of fear? Come on, do it. I dare you. Love its such a beautiful thing, how can you be afraid of it? Even if you are rejected you are still contributing on his self esteem, so its a win/win. 

Also, when you ask him out and if you guys eventually get married, think about this comment and smile :)"
offmychest,f83xrww,t3_dytq6b,1574223958.0,"Hey, i know it's rough but you need to be more careful. You want everybody to accept your beliefs, don't you? But what happen when you clash with someone with the same desire but opposing beliefs? He did you wrong, but by his eyes you are the one at fault. Subjectivity its complicated and delicate. Don't hate on someone for not accepting you the same way you don't want to be hated for what you are, that's what's important."
offmychest,f83x8wk,t3_dywgo6,1574223518.0,"You need to learn psychology. Kind words might not be enough. Be careful.

offmychest,f83ws7m,t3_dyv7ep,1574223132.0,"That guy you are talking about its a coward. Cheating its an spineless move. You deserve better, really. If you happen to feel bad because he is happy and you aren't, don't. He will make a bold move or a mistake in his new relationship and it will sink like a wasted ship. 

Focus on yourself. Find someone you harmonize with and go all in. Always make an effort for ""the one"" since there's no time for shyness."

offmychest,f83vax5,t3_dyu0dy,1574221929.0,"So you understand? You better learn from this experience so the next time you sense someone in distress, you are ready to help them. It's our responsibility to save those who are blinded by misery. The people who you talk about are hypocrites. They can't help it. But you are able to see the truth. Be the helping hand others deserve."
offmychest,f83tm5f,t3_dyuqq4,1574220599.0,"Lol, i just responded to a girl who was planning on killing herself, trying to save her life. Do you seriously believe you deserve some sort of sympathy? Get real."
offmychest,f83rsxu,t3_dytmmj,1574219225.0,"So you are planning on making everybody that knows you share you current misery when you die? Because thats what you are going to achieve. Your boyfriend heart: Destroyed. Any people who ever cared for you: Destroyed. You are going to leave a small scar in the world if you go through what you are planning. All the effort your boyfriend made to make sure you don't do something stupid, all those times and moments he shared with you reduce into worthless trash. You can't possibly be that cruel. I know you won't do it. I know you are at the bottom of your heart a good person capable of sweet things, capable of smiling. Someone considered enough to not let other people share your burden. I know you have the strength to move forward. I know you have the strength to smile. Maybe only once a day, but eventually you will become strong enough to keep it up all day if necessary. I know you have the strength to make your boyfriend happy, because he certainly deserves it, and you have the potential to do it. You know why? Because you are a human being. Part of an species capable of huge adaptability and progress. Don't believe in yourself if you can't, believe in your intrinsic nature instead.

Edit: Lol, fuck you! How do you even dare to tell me to not try to discourage you?! Like if your life was worthless. Really? You expect me to just sit in the sidelines and idly watch you die?! Duck you! You may believe to be worthless yourself, but I'm the one who decides wether you are worthy of life or not. You don't have the right to impose any sort of behavior on me, or anyone. If your boyfriend wants to dedicate his life to make yours slightly better then he is free to do so, and I respect him deeply for doing it.

Just forget about everything. The only thing you need now its remember to breath. Don't think. Just go with whoever you feel more comfortable with and hug them, you don't have to think anymore. Let everyone else do the dirty work, let anyone else with a good will think for you. Start anew. From scratch. Hug, kiss and smile. Focus only on that."

I recommend you to bribe the bully parents so they enforce some discipline into their child since they might not be the empathic type."
depression,f83481i,t3_dysa4z,1574204015.0,"Ok, i will give you 2 options or paths you could take:

1: Get a job and buy the medicine without anyone knowing. If you face limitations doing this, give the money to your psych in private and tell him/her to get them for you.

2: Mental illness its a complicated concept. Medication certainly helps suppressing the problem but it doesn't solve it. Its not an illness after all, it will be more proper to describe it as a condition reflecting specific values on your life. Fighting it without the support of medication can make you wiser and stronger. 

Its your choice."

You shouldn't stop taking your amnea pills since this might lead to Alzheimer in the future. Momentary sadness its way better than a full blown and one of the most frightening mental diseases.

depression,f82tlx7,t3_dyqjee,1574197966.0,"Ok, lets be real. You need to understand this: Love its Sacred. If life puts you in a 2 ways road you should always take the one that leads you into prosperity with this sentiment. 

I recommend you to study the Pick Up Arts, Woman Psychology, Romantic Arpoachs and to put some effort in working in upgrading your qualities: Looks, Personality and Talent are of especial relevance. You do have the potential of conquering her heart, you just need discipline.

Remember the words of Miguel De Cervantes in the Don Quijote: Love is War. And that statement can be closest to the truth."
depression,f82stis,t3_dyqnbu,1574197530.0,"Sadness, tends to blind us and drift us away from logic and joy. Even though death might seem appealing at times, remember its only a response based on the fear of going on with present notions. At the end happiness its the only thing we should strive for. Don't fall into the deptless pit of temptation. Gather strength, wether its shaped as emotional support, an activity, inspiring entertainment, friends and family or whatever resource its most accesible to you right now. Balance its key. Don't take more frustration than the happiness you are gaining from life."

Be sincere, tell her the truth, that you envy her positivity and ability to swiftly go through life, tell her in simple terms how you feel about your position, just don't force anything on her, keep it all casual. You see, the thing with those people is that they usually have a pretty strong sense of empathy so she might become a pretty good friend of yours.

Another important thing. Sometimes the stronger individuals are born from misery.Wisdom its a pretty good asset you can extrapolate from your position."
