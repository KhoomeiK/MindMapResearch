So the other person who looks least like me gets left out.

infj,fhov98d,t1_fhmizfd,1581775004.0,"Hmm. Wrong. 
How is NiTi unhealthy and NeTi healthy? Ne is just gathering ideas and concepts, generating a lot of possibilities and Ni is organizing ideas and concepts, and going in deep on one idea.
Ti is making decisions based on your reasoning and logic, focused on yourself.
So explain, how is Ne+Ti ""healthy"" and Ni+Ti ""unhealthy""? Or did you just read some things on the internet about loops and believe its true? I believe that any pair of functions can be your saviour functions, it only needs to be one decider function and one observer. That way, you can have all kinds of types. NiTi INFJs, NeFe ENTPs. SeTe ESFPs. Etc. To support my argument: Yes, i've seen ESTPs who are SeFe, and INTJs who are NiFi (my mom is NiFi, and yes, she's a healthy and kind person who has a good life)

EDIT: I'm a NiTi INFJ, and i'm also doing great in life and i cant complain. People dont see me as an unhealthy person, and neither do i."
