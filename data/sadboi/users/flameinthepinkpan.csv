The change that‚Äôs happening now should be happening naturally over the course of thousands of years. Yet, since the industrial revolution, this effect has been exhilarated to happen in just around 100 years. This causes temperatures to fluctuate more and more: colder an dryer winters, hotter and dryer summers. The weather will get more extreme, resulting in more crop failure and according to the UN will lead to a food shortage by 2050. Here in the Netherlands my area is at risk of WATER SHORTAGE because the river that is used for a big portion of my drinking water doesn‚Äôt have as much water running trough it due to how dry t has been these past few years. This is an effect of climate change. If you want us and newer generations to eat, drink, and live without extreme natural disasters being a daily thing, wake the fuck up and do something."
