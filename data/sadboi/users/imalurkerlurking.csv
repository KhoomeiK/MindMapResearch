gainit,fpdhd0z,t3_gcovpx,1588527011.0,"I have a hard time eating too. So far the best thing I've found is making my food tasty af. Butter and Spices. When I think I've added enough iadd a little bit more. I can eat it if it's drowned or over spiced but if it's boring I just wont.  

The part about just not ""obeying"" your hunger makes me wonder if it's a control thing. I didn't really have control of my food growing up and my parents used it as power over me so now I'm in the bad habit of feeling powerful by disobeying my stomach. Luckily I'm poor so if I make food and throw a bunch of spices in it I feel wasteful not eating it. Maybe tricking yourself can work for you too"

I always feel like my life is in danger, and now that everyone else does too I feel kinda normal. Plus, I think I handle it better than a lot of people, especially considering that I've never expected my danger to go away"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,ff0mtnx,t1_fex0lhb,1579470349.0,"I'm not really sure what you're asking. 

It's an infographic about how to treat a person like a person and why they're worthy of it. Most people probably don't need a friendly reminder that calling someone ""cis-scum"", or asking what's in someone's pants is rude. When most people hear someone else is in a hetero relationship they don't show a special interest, hate, wish them all the best, or say something that belittles the relationship by making it seem like just an experiment. 

That would be ridiculous, right? But those things are pretty normal for non cis/hetero people to have to deal with. Personally, I started to buy in to it and invalidate myself because so many other people were constantly making me feel like my identity and tastes were ridiculous jokes or just meant to provoke other people. They weren't. 

I felt so much pressure to hide who I was and what i like that I wasn't even comfortable subscribing to subs like this  because someone might somehow find out what I actually like or think. That's ridiculous. Seeing things like this help me realize how little most people understand trans issues or even the basic fact that trans people still have feelings and require the same basic level of respect as anyone else."

This shows how rude and ill-informed most people are when it comes to anything outside the cis-heteronormative mainstream.

It's nice to see other people finding these kinds of things ridiculous too."
ptsd,f3fyool,t3_dguzsl,1570904852.0,"I'm happy for you. Acknowledging mental health issues can be difficult because of how society stigmatizes them but I always try to look at it as any other illness. If your last job had asbestos in the cieling and gave you cancer would you feel any shame about having cancer? You shouldn't, and you shouldnt be made to feel bad about ptsd either because it's not your fault or your deficiency ðŸ’ž.  

Hopefully you get the job!"

What would you think if the boyfriend had a reputation for being hot so the other girls at school said she was lucky and a bitch for reporting him?  

Would you support her?  

Honestly. 

And if you're football friends don't understand that and you support yourself anyway then you are way stronger than they thought because you're taking care of your own problems regardless of what's easiest."
ptsd,f1dk644,t3_d8trwq,1569387073.0,"It's been pretty mixed for me. I worked my way up to 3 mg pretty quickly and it's stopped the dreams that soak me in sweat and make me sit bolt upright at 3 am.  

I still dream, still have bad dreams, and it's hard to get up in the morning if I take it too late, but it's not the heavy sedation/drugged feeling I had with sleeping meds and it keeps me from being afraid to go to sleep.  

I've actually started working out more since I started taking it. My cardio might not be as good but I think I'm being optimistic if I'm blaming the meds for that (beer has been my favorite medication for a few years). I'm taking it with buspirone and working on things with a psychologist so I'm not sure which it is, but I feel better in my day-to-day. I think the lack of constant fear,shame, ruminating, and sense of loss of control has helped a lot.  

Definitely be your own advocate, but give meds a chance too. They dont all work right away or solve every problem. They're tools. Youd have a hard time putting a car back together with just a screwdriver.

Goodluck"

It's a big deal, but it doesn't feel as bad if you can talk about with someone you trust.  

Just know that feelings can change the way a story is told so, how severe it felt/the extent of what happened or the effects may change with each retelling and it's not a lie or a problem with memory (beside repression). It's a problem of emotional context at the time"

I hate that you have to deal with any of this. I started to feel like I was obsessed with sex/ anything sexual and I always felt like I needed to act on it.

berkeley,ewg0103,t1_eweramt,1565370924.0,"I lived in Unit 2 my for first year and summer classes. My first room faced the inside courtyard but my second room faced Dwight and we'd get serenaded by all types of sounds from the park. My favorite was a middle aged lady screaming Bruno Mars up at our building at 4 am.  

I'm a tall male transfer student but I walk like a scared giraffe. I was asked if I wanted to buy drugs everytime I walked by the park towards bongo burger but I never had any problems.   

Pro tip from doing year long research at the park: make eye contact and acknowledge homeless people. If you treat them like they're normal people who you're afraid of they'll most likely treat you like a normal person and not try to scare you.  

There are some volunteer organizations that work in the park and are a great way to become comfortable with being around it. Food Not Bombs and Catholic Worker: Night on the Streets are the 2 I know and reccomend for feeling safer where you live."
