Nowadays, its ok for Asians to get married late, but even in modern Asian societies (like Singapore, where I am from), getting married is still a norm and even a societal responsibility.

However, for guys like me, the unwanted pariahs, the ugly short dudes with zero attractive factors (lousy body, introvert, loser personality, fuck up in life) its actually impossible to get anybody. I realised I'm unwanted goods when I reached 25, 3 years ago, and still had never been on one single date. I am the only child in my family. I come from a lower-mid income family. So my parents were hoping I'd be somebody and have a family of my own so that we can break the cycle of being poor.

Unfortunately, all they got was a son who constantly fucked up. I got a low paying job and I told my mum that because of what I am, I will probably never get married because I'm no good for anyone.

She actually cried and asked me whats gonna happen to me once they're gone. I just told her I got it sorted out. I plan to live alone as usual and if I get old one day, I'll check myself into a group home (provided I don't suddenly die alone in my own home).

Lol. Its always this perception from girls in general towards ugly guys like us. Like 'He's ugly. So he is definitely gonna treat me like shit to boost his self esteem'.

Its like you ladies find and make up any reason in your head just to hate us. Ugly guys treating women like shit has to be the biggest pile of nonsense I've heard. Ugly guys would be thankful if even an unattractive girl would talk to them. Most of the time, girls make up excuses like these to not talk to us. 'Eww he is creepy. Eww he is a misogynist. Eww he is mean.'

And all these girls come to conclusion without actually interacting with an ugly guy.

Im not trying to push your experiences aside but tbh guys really dont give a fuck about looks. Look up how many bodybuilders have gfs who are obese. They really dont care. Now tell me how many fit ladies have bfs who are slobs. Ladies tend to throw the 'I want someone of equal social standing' more than men.

ForeverAlone,fijlkfl,t1_fij4n56,1582453727.0,"I don't what kind of guys are you talking to. But I definitely find unattractive girls easier tobwork with and talk to. They don't look down on you. They don't think you're out to date them. They're nice and easy going. Much more sociable to be around. Attractive girls are just mostly big pieces of shit. Attitude stinks.

I have really attractive male friends and never once did they treat unattractive people like crap. Heck, they even became good friends with an ugly shit like me. But never once did an attractive girl wanted to be my friend (Im saying friends not date) bcos they simply hate me for my looks and do not want to talk to me.

So yeah girls are definitely more meaner when it comes to looks."

Yeah, thats's never happening for me.

But Im happy that you found someone. May both of your love last forever!"
ForeverAlone,fijj0ss,t1_fi9oam2,1582450241.0,"Bro, you missed the point of his post? He obviously flirted back. It was a back and forth thing until he decided to ask her out. And then she said its just for fun and he's not her type. Its obvious this girl has some serious issues and sees manipulating people as 'fun'.

Like her behavior doesn't need validation. What she needs is therapy. I know coming from an FA. But I think her attitude and mentality is worse than an FA. It sounds like she is a sociopath."
ForeverAlone,fi8op3e,t1_fi72omc,1582244902.0,"Uhhh? Whats with putting sex on a pedestal?

Like he said nothing about her being sexual. You think a girl who flirts with you for 'fun' wanna have sex with you? Dude she even rejected him after asking her out.

Don't mean to be harsh, but I think you're giving excuses for manipulative behavior."
ForeverAlone,fi71yh9,t1_fi6kspy,1582212580.0,"Oh gtfo here with your white knighting. It doesn't matter who did it. If it was a guy doing it, he's an asshole. If it is a girl doing it, she's a bitch. Its that simple.

Stop pulling out the victim or sexist card out of your ass to try and validate shitty behavior. Being a girl doesnt give her a pass to be a shitty human being."
ForeverAlone,fi71oq9,t1_fi6v78s,1582212418.0,Uhhh.. No... Unless YOU'RE one of those people. Seems like you hang out with peoplevstraight out from those teenage college flicks or you must think the whole world is into American Pie shit.
ForeverAlone,fi6hmmg,t1_fi5whym,1582195304.0,"Lol stop validating shitty behavior. Of course she was lying. Thats just shit behavior which sadly has been normalized and treated as nothing wrong. Don't take people for a ride. Doing that shows how much of a toxic human being she is. Flirting for 'fun' is definitely a sign of a shitty humn being.

If you wanna be friends, tell from the straight off. Its fking nonsensical that the girl couldn't pick up that he was serious."
residentevil,fi6e0pq,t1_fi6a3vj,1582190249.0,"Exactly like he said ^

Like seriously, I think the zombies now sound like actual zombies instead of people having orgasms.

Even the licker sounds terrifying compared to the old ones which sounds like someone yawning.

Like I love the nostalgia guys but come on, RE is seriously trying to move into a more A-grade horror experience instead of cheesy B film horror/comedy. We should appreciate what Capcom is doing."
residentevil,fi620bz,t1_fi5wvuz,1582176450.0,"I mean the whole point of Remake was to make re series more realistic instead of cheesy. So yeah a realistic Nemesis would have slurred considering how fucked up his face and mouth is.

SuicideWatch,fi32yi7,t3_f5sajn,1582098530.0,"I get where you're coming from. I too will commit suicide. But only after my parents are gone. I'm the only child and I don't think they'll understand this is my way of atonement if I did it now. They'll probably blame it on themselves for the rest of their lives.

Same as your daughter and wife. Maybe your wife will move on. But your daughter? I highly doubt so. Even more if you plan to spend quality time and give her all your attention for these few days before you end it all. She is gonna specifically remember the last few days and it will really scar her for the rest of her life that she will never get to enjoy those last few days like she did with the man who brought her to this world ever again.

You're young. 24. You've got a family. I'd give my left arm to have a family of my own. But all I have is nothing. A big failure at 28 who can't even have a family of his own like he always wished.

Nothing you're gonna do is atonement man. Sorry to say, its an insult to guys like me. Who are even bigger failures than you are. Who will likely never recover.

I don't care how cliche this sounds. Think about your kid. You've got a rough diamond (family) in your hands. Stop giving up. Fall every time and get back up everytime and keep polishing that diamond till it shines. Doesn't matter if your hands bleed in the process.

You've got nothing to atone for. You have not sinned. You're human. You make mistakes."
lonely,fi313g7,t1_fi2350e,1582096232.0,"Btw I don't care anymore if anyone wants to call me an 'incel' or 'misogynist'. I'm gonna hang myself in a few years time anyways. So might as well I share what I have been thinking inside for the last few years after my experiences with women in general. 

I don't hate women. Like fuck those guys sending you rude pms and asking for nudes etc. But also fuck the women here who mostly appear on v-day and start sulking about 'missing their exes' and 'feeling shitty about their friends going on dates'. Its an insult to the men here who have lived their lives lonely, truly ostracized and rejected and yet still told by mainstream society to shut the fuck up and carry on because they have a dick swinging between their legs. 

The hypocrisy makes me sick lol."
lonely,fi30hia,t1_fi2350e,1582095515.0,">please don’t assume these things about women and how we have a choice, most don’t. think about the women you see on the street, do they all look like insta worthy models?

No I'm not saying every woman is insta worthy or look like a model. I'm saying is, every woman, regardless of shape, size, looks and backgrounds do have a choice whether they know it or not. Its science. You guys do the selecting. Not the men.

Say whatever you want, but the truth is out there. Scour the internet. The forums and even reddit. You'll see who's getting put down like dogs everytime they get their feelings known. Who's the ones getting made fun of and toyed around with but yet are forced to put on a straight face and 'man up' bcos of whats between their legs. See who are the ones that mostly got the short end of the stick."

SuicideWatch,fi2ycoi,t1_fi2g7mx,1582093183.0,"Lol people in third world countries are doing better than I am. I stay near third world countries. They enjoy life much more than I do. Despite being so called 'poor'. Which is not true because yes their country is poor but most of the time they have enough to go by. I stay in a so called 'first world country' yet I'm scraping by living off two bucks a day. Sometimes a week. So I do starve myself. And food here in my country costs 4.50 average.

So yeah, that and Im really lonely, hitting 28. Never hit those 'fun years' before 30 bcos most of the time I was suffering. My parents are around your age and it seems they had a better youth. People your age usually do. You guys lived in a waaay better era. So pls don't trivialize what we're going through."

>i dated guys that’d be seemed as “ugly” or “the average joe”. seriously don’t assume shit lmfao

Oh boy I sure as hell never saw this comment from all the other normal ladies anywhere else 🙄

And somehow their version of 'average Joe' is a dude that looks like Bieber or some Instagram model 😂


Yeah well pfft. Whatever you say. 

Like should I be surprised you ladies only mostly start cropping up in lonely and FA forums when its Valentine's Day? 

Because every other day its fine to treat men like shit given the wide choices you all have these days but on Valentine's day, just on this day, just because you women have no one, all of a sudden 'both men and women' are equally lonely. 

Lol get outta here 😂😂😂"

ForeverAlone,fi00z7z,t1_fhzxfu4,1582021308.0,"Bro. What you're doing is a noble job. I hope you carry on. We need more people like you out there. Our world needs more empathy. Its lacking that with all the technology currently.

But may I suggest, don't start at the FA sub. Most of the dudes here, me included, we came here on our own accord and we ain't gonna leave. We can't leave and we never will. Its sort of like Dark Souls ya know? (lol wtf am I even saying). We're like the undead who is just gonna keep wandering around.

You're gonna get turned off trying to help ppl in FA. We already believe there is nothing we can do to improve ourselves. Most of us in fact have tried to improve ourselves but met with no success. I believe you should head to the suicide or depression forums. Your work would be much more appreciated there.

I seriously don't want bright young men like you to lose interest in helping ppl. We need more guys like you in the world out there."
ForeverAlone,fi00q2l,t1_fhzde37,1582020939.0,"Not really true. Doesn't matter you believe you gonna die or not.

On a life raft, you've got 2 weeks before you're in real danger. Its not bout 'believing' or whatever. Its about training, knowing to use equipments found in said life raft, skills at rationing. The sea doesn't give a shit bout what you're believing in. It will kill you with hypothermia given any chance.

Trust me. They taught us this is merchant marine school."
