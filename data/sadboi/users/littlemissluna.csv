Sucks cause sometimes although not intentionally, they can be enabling friends. I wanna be there for you but you speaking on a subject may trigger something within me. You wanna be a good friend and hear them out but its counterproductive. You're def not alone!"

Bird baths work for me when that's all i have energy for. Consists of dry shampoo, wet cloth to intimate areas, and some perfume/deodorant. We're doing the best we can."
BipolarReddit,fcidla9,t3_eh6qq7,1577660963.0,"This is something I hope to improve on next year. I also have amazon wishlists, and sometimes it makes it easier to move it to the list instead of to the cart but when mania is peaking, its terribly easy to spend hundreds  of dollars on stuff I DO NOT NEED. The idea is to separate yourself from the decision as much as possible.

1) I don't have my card info saved on websites, it's easy to click click click and bam! you don't have money for bills. If I need to buy something I have to actively go get my purse/search my wallet. This adds time from the impulsive decision.

2) cut credit cards, really. If i get one sent in the mail, I cut it up and keep a bag of them out of sight.

3) have cash at hand. If I am going to the store I will only carry cash and sometimes leave my wallet in the car's glove compartment. Again adding space from you and the decision.

4) If I need to make an impulsive buy or anything really, I set a timer on my phone. 5-10 minutes. I then distract myself, try to self soothe by giving myself a hug and do anything but think about the purchase I want to make. After the timer is up, more times than not i'd change my mind entirely.

You're not alone and it seems bipolar disorder and financial struggles go hand in hand. You got this!"
