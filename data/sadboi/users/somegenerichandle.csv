BlackPillFeminism,fqsvok1,t3_gkq4sk,1589620538.0,"yeah a similar thing happened to me. It was around the time that ASAP Science video came out about testosterone. It really does correlate with violence. They accused me of making it an excuse for their bad behavior or that i was somehow forgiving it because they couldn't control it. After reading what you wrote tho, i think these women might have the nature fallacy. Insofar that everything that is natural is good. A lot of people rely on it to sell health food or advocate for gay rights. Let me be clear, being homosexual is good, it's just not necessarily good because for many people it is innate."
Antipsychiatry,fqsumrx,t3_gk342r,1589619433.0,I bet Howie Hawkins would add something to his platform if people asked him nicely.
Antipsychiatry,fqsu3xy,t3_gknkhj,1589618900.0,"I'm surprised Psychology Today used that headline. One therapist kept telling me i had anxiety, i kept telling her it was normal. I did witness someone having what they called an anxiety attack, it's left me kind of confused and wondering what exactly they are. BTW, there is a South Park episode about Cartman claiming he has it, because, of course it's Cartman he's got ASD and GD too.

Why? Probably the medical industry needs more clients.Hospitals are laying off staff in the midst of a pandemic because there are no elective surgeries. Maybe people will realize a lot of this is unnecessary."

PurplePillDebate,fqsonuu,t3_gkl0nh,1589613546.0,"Yes, the majority of men do not approach. I think it's probably just exacerbation of not being approached by decent men which is why women complain. If by approach you mean not saying anything and either holding my shoulders or wrist or tugging my hair, yes this happens a maybe every 3-4 months. I just calmly say ""please don't touch me.""  Personally, i wouldn't mind if more men made eye contact and used their words to start conversation. And this happens and it's fine, i just wish more of them weren't old enough to be my father."

GCdebatesQT,fqsllj8,t3_gkln0c,1589610803.0,"I do not typically experience attraction right away. It's the same for men and women. Creative, open, conscientious, agreeable, believes in God/s, wants the world to be a better place, active, adventurous but not too much, independant. However, i am not convinced i'd be happier in a romantic relationship.

I don't see much conflict anymore. But from the ages of 10-15 i was convinced i should reproduce."

feminisms,fqsi868,t3_gkl5c1,1589607989.0,"You're absolutely right, nearly all women and girls are impacted by it. They either have modified their behavior, been threatened, or know someone who has been raped. I really think the number of sexual assaults are more like one in four. The CDC has women raped in their lifetime as a range from 13-46% depending on your orientation. Intimate partner violence and stalking are far more common.  https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_SOfindings.pdf"
