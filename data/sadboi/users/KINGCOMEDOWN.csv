Don‚Äôt mind at all. Not necessarily, I posted the photo originally in r/blunderyears on my own accord, but I didn‚Äôt think it would blow up as big as it did and continue to be reposted throughout reddit a year later. 

I will say, I do read all of the comments on these posts and am blown away by comments along the lines of ‚Äúthis is why bullies exist..‚Äù etc.,  and I think that motivates me a lot to continue what I‚Äôm doing. Because during that era, no surprise, I was bullied a lot for my appearance/personality and about the same time this picture was taken I had tried to commit suicide for the first time. 

If anything, the reactions that this photo gets in a lot of ways really does influence my progress in what I‚Äôd like to accomplish.
