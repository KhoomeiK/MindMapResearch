medicalmarijuana,fqf091m,t1_fqcpwnd,1589316548.0,My dr said i should have the card very soon. He said if i dont i can call him. Hes super active in and part of a committee or something or other. So he said his patients have theirs within 2 weeks. I hope hes right. Thank you for your response.
medicalmarijuana,fqezl8l,t1_fqekbf2,1589316227.0,"No. Only low thc. 5% or less. And we cant even legally buy it here. We can possess 20 ml or less of the low thc oil. And i can also purchase out of state with the card. I have a chronic illness that requires treatment from a pain clinic. In order to receive treatment from the pain clinic i have to take a drug test. If i have my thc card, the dont test for thc. So even tho i cant buy what i want, its more of a way to be protected,  and not discriminated against for testing positive for thc. Edit. I use thc with a much higher % from the ""black market"". Lol So its really only useful for me in that i can still get medical treatment with out quitting thc."
medicalmarijuana,fqez639,t1_fqcxcau,1589316024.0,"Yea. Its a life saver, quite literally. Also having the card will make it so i can see a pain specialist even tho i test positive for thc. Which is the main thing. And i hope you are able to get the help you need also!"

Apparently once my dr puts me on the registry,  all the health department does is verify my personal info and tell me where to get my card.

And I don't get stressed out by Reddit. If I did I'd stay away. I got enough stress in my life right now without adding unnecessary factors. Lol You don't have to be worked up to have a negative opinion on what someone else beliefs. You can disagree with out being angry about it.

I don't think it's the person-whos-wearing-makeups ""fault"" that nieve people expect something that is not realistic simply because they don't know any better. It's our job as individuals to actively persue truth. There are men that ""nievely"" (ik that's not a word) stay living in a fantasy world. But that's no one's fault but their own. But there ARE plenty of men and women who know better. And, what's more, there ARE men and women out there who appreciate completely natural beauty and appreciate when others ""do themselves up"" without implying one is more beautiful than the other. And it's MY unpopular opinion that thinking make up makes someone more beautiful is an immature idea. Lol. once again, there is no anger or frustration in any of my posts. Just enjoying an argument with people who don't agree with me. I believe it's good to argue as it can expand my way of thinking in ways I wouldn't be able to do by only talking to people who agree with me."
unpopularopinion,fkv6g9u,t1_fkv5ikz,1584563047.0,"That's from your perspective only. I know plenty of MEN who do not feel that way. And from a womans perspective I can say most women my age that I know don't wear makeup to appeal to the interest of others. YOU are seeing what you want to in regards to what is done and why. It sets an expectation for YOU. most people don't expect women to be ""blemish free or have even skin tones."" YOU do. And that's fine for you and whomever you date. But that is definitely not an absolute truth. And assuming it is brings me back my argument for immaturity I claimed with op."
unpopularopinion,fkv3t3t,t1_fkv3njz,1584561439.0,You don't know enough women. That's why I said your opinion is an immature one. Not enough experience to have an educated opinion on the matter.
unpopularopinion,fkv3ese,t1_fkv2iv3,1584561198.0,"I'm not saying you said I was ugly. I'm notüòÇ. I'm saying neither is uglier. One has make up on and one doesn't. Neither is better than the other. It's just a DIFFERENT look. We have 2 completely different opinions. I find yours to be immature. And you think I'm wrong. I'm ok with that. We aren't dating or even know each other. So it doesn't matter if we agree. I mostly took the time to comment because I want other women to know that there are men who don't equate beauty with make up. Women wear makeup cus they WANT to. Not because it makes them more beautiful. It's a fun way to express yourself. Not a thing done to ""cover ugliness"""

People who have opinions like yours make me love my husband even more. I'm not trying to be mean, but that's the truth."
unpopularopinion,fkv1ups,t3_fkv9wv,1584560350.0,"It's more about being on the same page. In some relationship..  ie open relationships,.. sleeping with someone else isn't cheating. Y'all both have to be honest and respect about how what you're doing makes the other person feel. Y'all are both ok with porn, right on. Y'all are made uncomfortable by porn. That's cool. Open relationship? Bet. Whatever works for both people.its about the broad idea of mutual respect and honesty."
unpopularopinion,fkv15t0,t3_fkva7z,1584559971.0,"I never dressed up or wore make up when we fist met. He met me and I was looking completely natural. Your comment is not true. And being in a more natural and comfortable state isn't seen as ""uglier"" to some either. Like my husband. Me putting on lipstick for special occasions is just a DIFFERENT look. Not an UGLIER look."

opiates,fkl1070,t3_fj4xn2,1584296157.0,"Relapse is the 13th step no one ever acknowledges.  I even have it tatted on my arm. I'm not saying that you continue to relapse. I am saying it's part of the process. So try not to feel defeated, or embarrassed. Maybe, try to accept that it happened, (as it does with most) learn from it, and continue on down your path. Soberity is not a straight line. And all you have to do to succeed is to try your best.  Maybe use this as a learning tool. And when you are ready to help others, this story of relapse you have will be a huge tool you can use to guide others. I can definitely say I am proud of your accomplishments and success. Keep up the good work!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"

 My original anxiety came from a painful chronic illness... and this whole coronavirus thing has made it so much wose
 I have had to up my anxiety meds... one thing that helps is reminding my self, is to live in the now... like.. i DONT have it right this second. And also i remind myself i am taking all the necessary precautions. Hand washing, hand sanitizer... and something stupid that makes me feel better is that i spray anyone down with lysol before they come in my house or car.  Also i try to remind myself that statistically speaking the odd of us dying from this are relatively low. If that helps or not. Lol. I hope you are able to find peace. And stay healthy. üòÅüòÅ"

Endo,fjvrcdt,t3_ff4y1y,1583630239.0,"Check out Nancy's nook on Facebook. It's not a discussion board, but a place for self education. They offer lists of endometriosis and excision specialists. If there is anything I have learned with Endo it's that you have to be your own advocate. Most gyns are not experienced or educated enough to know how to even properly diagnose this disease. Much less treat it. You are right to want a laparoscopy. Dont stop till you get one!!  Best of luck to you. I'm sure you will find what you are looking for as long as you keep speaking up for yourself!!!!"
