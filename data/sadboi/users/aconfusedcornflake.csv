fuckeatingdisorders,fc2byid,t3_efpmlk,1577351156.0,"Recovery isn't linear and for many of us it's the hardest shit we'll ever go through alone. It gets better and takes a LOT of time. Believe in baby steps, you stopped mid-purge, for example. :) After the holidays, just try eating 3 healthy-ish meals with nutrients and indulge sometimes with a little something you like. Celebrate each victory, and get back up after each misstep (can be one day or a bad period, just get back up afterwards). The fallbacks will get rarer and rarer and one day we'll be on the other side, and we'll know how strong we have become. Wish you all the best and hope we'll all love ourselves enough to simply love and live life very soon!"
