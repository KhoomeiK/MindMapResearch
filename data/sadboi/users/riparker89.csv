BPD,fdp50ez,t3_emf9zd,1578620138.0,"I feel for you. I'm dreading my fp leaving tomorrow to go spend time with a friend for the weekend. When he told me earlier this week that he was going, I instantly go sad and upset even though I know he should go hang out with his friends. The most frustrating thing about having BPD is knowing you're overreacting and still not being able to stop it. I dont get why it's so hard for us to accept that our fp has a life that doesnt revolve around just us."

BPD,f6va9lg,t3_dt2ype,1573180691.0,"I went to a psych ward in middle GA and it was the worst 14 days of my life. The psych never actually came to the hospital. We had 10-30 minute skype sessions with him from his Atlanta office. I spent my sessions with him disassociating because he would constantly say things to try to get a reaction from me. Towards the end of my stay there, he told me he's worked with many patients at many different places. He told me every time he spoke to me, i never expressed any emotion and looked dead behind the eyes. I was then told i reminded him of serial killers that he has worked with. That really broke my spirit. After that session, i stayed in my room, crying for the rest of the day. I didnt care that I wasnt supposed to be in bed. I never wanted to die more in my life."
