streamentry,fr50qap,t3_gmb6m7,1589900418.0,"Thanks for bringing up this topic! I’ve wanted to many times but couldn’t find the right words. For years in my early 20s I tried to keep a meditation practice but could only commit for a few periods here and there. While I noticed it benefited me some times it gutted me at others. Being more deeply in my karmic conditioning at that point I couldn’t see what was happening and blamed myself for not being able to “do” meditation properly. 


My therapist said something that I’m reminded of in your post here. About how they found that soldiers who came back with PTSD from the war often had traumatic childhoods. And ones who had healthy/ loving homes experienced way lower incidence of developing PTSD upon returning. I always thought the traumatic incidents that happened to me had shaped and caused all my problems. But it turns out it was actually my childhood- and the traumatic events just blew it up further."

So it’s not so bad” didn’t seem like a good enough reason to me. But they really ARE cute. I finally have an appreciative audience for all my terrible jokes, silly faces and improv dance moves. It gives me life. Finally, I am appreciated. I wish I’d gotten my level 1 cert sooner! 🤣"
vipkid,fr29ajx,t1_fr0qc1p,1589833357.0,Yes I used to do boxing and started throwing that in.

vipkid,fq9yak2,t1_fq9xvm4,1589209402.0,"This is a good practice to start. I’ve been doing this a little with select students but I could definitely be more in-depth. What levels do you usually give crit and praise summary? And what do you say? 
I remember I had a kid read a difficult word at one point in class all on their own. So at the end of class I was like “you read very well today! And when you said “blahblorpbleep” perfectly?? Wow! 
Would love to add some new crit/ praise ideas to my rotation."
vipkid,fq9tig0,t3_ghk661,1589206732.0,I’m kind of hoping that maybe this breakdown illuminated something for her and she talked to her parents. And that they then just cancelled VIP kid classes in general since she clearly despises it so much. Thanks for sharing this illuminating perspective. I wish more students could articulate what was wrong with them. Although tbh I truly think when a student is this off kilter all the time there’s something going on with their home life and has very little to do with the face in the screen teaching them english.
vipkid,fq9stse,t1_fq9ep2e,1589206329.0,"I don’t want to put words in your mouth but I have some things to say here— Sometimes there really isn’t a way to ‘break through’. I think that kind of thinking isn’t always constructive. Sometimes the solution is letting go of a particular outcome with a student. You show up and do your best. Let the rest go. She’s a person you can’t control and is just as much an agent of her actions as you are of yours. As this post illustrates, they have depth and other stuff going on. Their dialogue illuminates a LOT about her process- but clearly it is NOT just the vipkid teachers because what “healthy” child (and really a mentally healthy child is entirely dependent on home life) goes off the deep end the way this kid did because of a few teachers? Where were the adults to help her? Clearly she’s miserable but they don’t care and keep forcing her to take classes. That has WAY more impact  on the way she takes classes than the VIP kid teacher themselves. Personally I’ve really struggled with this. Ive had a kid for over 50 classes that is similarly rude. It was a nightmare to teach her and I genuinely struggled with my view of myself as a teacher because I was certain it was my job to bend myself into enough of a pretzel to accommodate her somehow. And it made me utterly  miserable. I think more teachers need to let go of that as it’s unhealthy. Do the best you can, but some kids aren’t a fit. And, very sadly, many kids have bad home lives and shite parents. There’s just only so much you can do."

vipkid,fpditrm,t1_fpdbzxy,1588527833.0,"AH! Ok. My misunderstanding. I see what you’re saying now and thanks for clarifying. It’s interesting bringing light to that makes me realize the underhanded reason a company has “incentives” in the first place. I genuinely appreciate the deeper nuance in that now. Regardless, I think it’s unfair and a penalty - despite their stated policy around ‘participation’ incentives. Getting deducted $2 is whatever but $10 a class sucks.  I’m curious about your take regarding if VIP kid will eventually do away with most/ all incentives all together eventually. Especially now it’s getting as sparse as it is and they have more teachers than ever."
vipkid,fpd1imj,t1_fpd1316,1588517826.0,Hi. Are you familiar with VIP kid policy? We absolutely do get penalized. Also the “quotes” are “unnecessary” and “rude”. We get penalized if we cancel or no show within 2 hours. 10 dollars is deducted per class. So there is a penalty. Might wanna reread vipkid policy.
vipkid,fpcybrs,t3_gcnn9k,1588515769.0,My hot take: when assessments are finished the class should be over regardless if it’s 25 minutes. Like Starlight trials or whatever.
vipkid,fpcy82u,t1_fpcx9m2,1588515701.0,My thing is just that we shouldn’t be penalized. Should we receive pay for a class we got a TNS? No. Should we also not receive pay AND receive a penalty? HELL no. Speaking for myself personally- I never miss a class on purpose. Especially when it’s only 6 missed classes a contract. Very easy to fuck up if you’re alarm doesn’t go off one or two mornings. We shouldn’t get penalized on top of not receiving pay. That’s treating us like children.

I had significant struggles trying to meditate and still do because the very act of relaxing often triggers intense survival emotions completely disrupting the practice and the rest of my day. I’ve had to go slowly and impossibly gently towards a regular sitting meditation, and will often substitute with walking meditations- 5 minute 1-2x a day meditations etc that said it has taught me even more how much of a teacher the body really is. Tbh I wish more meditation/ bodywork had a label on it for people with trauma because it wasn’t until I saw a therapist that i learned it can actually be harmful to some people."

The firemen don’t even respond anymore - even before Covid. They literally will just cancel my calls because every time before that the parents never pick up the phone. I think there must be a note on their files that it’s a lost cause. It’s such a disaster. I’ll often pull up a YouTube video and watch that while I wait for them to decide if they’re going to respond. I have no idea why their parents pay for classes.

depression,fltz20o,t1_fls3mw8,1585491337.0,"“Brace yourself for the weird things that can happen after a tragedy.” Seriously this is so true. There were just so many bizarre and strange occurrences after something like this. Maybe it’s a weird example but I always thought JK Rowling did an amazing job with this regarding Dumbledore’s death.
I don’t think you can be prepared or ready- but just being aware that there will be very strange moments. They’ll be incredibly sad and fucked up and then also painfully hilarious ones. You will likely develop a morbid sense of humor and that’s ok. 
I learned some surprising and unsettling things about my mother right after she passed. I also got to see raw and vulnerable sides of grown adults which was scary and sort of comforting at the same time. Seeing their pain was weird for me as I was still a child at the time (13)."
depression,flrx1am,t3_fqquhp,1585429663.0,"I’m so sorry. That is beyond devastating. My mother also died very suddenly when I was 13. I second what the first commenter said about continuing to express yourself and connect with people. Try to get into some kind of grief counseling if possible (there are online therapists) because you will need the help to navigate this. Also understand all emotions are normal. I remember the night after my mom died I didn’t feel anything at all. Just numb. And I only wanted to watch cartoons. I remember thinking that must mean I was a horrible person who didn’t actually love her. When really I could only feel so much at once without wanting to escape or numb out. 

Know also that a lot of people are going to say things they think will help, but will probably seem hurtful and shallow. They’re just trying to help and they don’t understand what you’re going through. A lot of people won’t. 

It took me time to realize- but all the old cliches about how the relationship continues after they’re gone is really true. Your relationship will deepen in ways you can only begin to fathom now. When you are able, talk to your mother, write to her, have dinner with her talk to her about the sunset. But don’t do it if it makes you feel worse. A part of her really does exist inside of you. You will see signs/ signals from the universe that feel as if she’s trying to communicate. It’s totally up to your own interpretation whether it’s your psyche/ her spirit or a combination of both. Doesn’t mean it’s less real or not meaningful. 
Protect your energy and time. Sleep a lot if you need to. Eat ice cream. Watch your favorite cartoons. Don’t respond to people who are hurtful/ not helpful to you. You are obligated to nothing and no one right now. I hope you can get into see a professional as well. And of course, there are lots of forums for depression and grief to connect with others who understand. 
Take care."
