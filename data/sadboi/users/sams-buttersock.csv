swedishproblems,fmafoq2,t1_fm88u4r,1585892609.0,"I’ve been living in California since 2014 (originally from Kiruna) and I definitely don’t think American public transport is ever a viable option unless you’re in a group. As a woman, it’s not safe to travel alone on American public transport. This could be said for a lot of public transport, but in particular where I live and other cities I’ve visited, it’s generally not safe. However, the national parks (in California alone) are GORGEOUS! The parks in Utah are my favorite. But it is true, the smaller state parks in each state are amazing to visit, and oftentimes the workers (rangers) at the parks are very nice. They told me about a lot of cool places I could visit in the future (I’m working on them one by one)"
BPD,fl9e1i9,t3_fgh8zj,1584951429.0,"Damn this really cut deep into me. It’s too real, but it’s cool to know that there’s others out there who have these thoughts and experiences as well. I was recently diagnosed with BPD, and I’m still trying to make sense of all of it. Recently I just find myself fearing abandonment so much that I cannot be alone for any amount of time, even when I’m sleeping. I’m constantly worrying that my friends and loved ones are getting tired of me and wanting to leave me behind just because they haven’t talked to me in over a day, and I try to supplement their absences with other people as much as possible. Something as simple as going to the grocery store I cannot do alone, or else, well idk. Idk what the ‘or else’ is. I just can’t do it? It’s like I’m programmed to find someone, anyone, to go with me. This has only been going on for about a month now, and it feels really weird to me as I reflect on it now. Before this I was in an intense need for change, wanting to change my hair, my look, my whole face, but because I’m a broke college student that wasn’t exactly possible. I think the abandonment thoughts are what’s eating at me most right now. I don’t wanna constantly ask my friends and loved ones for reassurance (are u sure you’re not tired of me? Are u sure I’m not suffocating you?) but I can’t help it. Anyone relate?"
Dreams,fl3fi0j,t3_fmbh86,1584781503.0,"If it’s any consolation, I’ve been having dreams like this for about 13 years now, consistently. Every night I dream, I never sleep without dreaming, and in every dream, regardless of if it’s a nightmare or a normal dream, I die. Sometimes, it’s horrible (ex: throat slit, frowning, burning), Sometimes, it’s less painful (ex: dying from an illness). But you get used to it with time. A therapist recommended breathing exercises before bed, idky, but honestly they’ve been helping a bit. The violence has definitely curbed itself in my dreams. For meaning, I feel like these are manifested anxieties and fears about the lives we live. But I don’t have all the answers. I just know that you become kinda numb to it after enough time."
