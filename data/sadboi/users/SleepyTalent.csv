depression,fp8h3tu,t3_gbzjz2,1588392140.0,"When we have lived so much with depression, the idea of getting better just doesn't feel real, i used to have a group of friends but after my suicide attempt they all leaved me, after the attempt they were the only people that i talked about it. Nowadays idk if it was my fault, probably i put to much pressure in them, my best friend flew away to another country and all the others are living their lifes better than i am, and because of all that i have given up on people, because i feel that if i make some friend i'll hurt him or her, and i don't want to hurt anyone else (sorry for my english, its not my main language)"
