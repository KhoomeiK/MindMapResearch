TalkTherapy,fqjxz0j,t1_fqiqrqr,1589416823.0,Have you not been able to do video therapy?

TalkTherapy,fq894es,t3_gh7d8w,1589161010.0,"I did a similar thing. Only one of his siblings had a public account and I read waaay too many of their posts. I ended up bringing it up in therapy because through his sibling's page I saw some posts which suggested my therapist has certain beliefs that really played on my emotions. My T was surprised that I found that account, asked me how I found it and has since taken steps so no one else can follow the same rabbit hole I did.

He wasn't visibly upset with me and did his best to stay focused on me. I'm not sure if I picked up on him feeling a bit violated or I was projecting my guilt, but I asked if he felt creeped out by me. He said yes and that he did feel a little violated and I think it was the most shameful moment I have had in therapy. I felt so gross and yucky but also sad because I wasn't trying to be creepy I just wanted to feel close to him. I wanted to simultaneously die of shame and get angry at him for not saying what I did was understandable.

We ended up talking about what I got out of therapy that I don't get elsewhere and why did I want to feel close to him. I was able to be more honest than usual because I had already told him the Bad Thing™ I had done so I felt like I didn't have anything to lose. We talked about how I put him up on a pedestal and that he is not as good or perfect or put together as I imagine he is. He even told the younger part of me that he was proud of me for being so honest.

The shame that I felt when he said he did feel creeped out and violated came back between sessions and it was very hard for me to not run away and cancel all my sessions. 

It ended up being really helpful for me and my feelings of transference, because I started to view him as a person with a life outside of therapy and of course he wants to keep that separate from his work. I did something that made him uncomfortable and it was clear that, despite me wanting him to be a father figure to me, there is a boundary between his personal life and him in the therapy room. And he could simultaneously not want me in his personal life but still treat me with kindness, curiosity and acceptance in therapy.

Having said all that, there is always the chance that your therapist may not have sorted out their own stuff and may react poorly to you disclosing that information."

And I'm tired of having to keep my door ajar so my pets don't freak out and scratch the door to shreds. Having it closed makes me feel safer but the distraction from them clawing at it is too much (doesn't matter which side of the door they're on, they always want to be on the other side)."

Everytime he said it I just ignored it because I didn't agree with him and wrote it off to him not understanding me. But now I see it so clearly. I'm constantly bouncing around that triangle. I find wanting to be rescued (being a victim) very hard to deal with. The urge to find someone who will fix the problem at hand gets so strong and it's very hard for me to think for myself.

Maybe I spend too much time thinking about it and reliving nice moments we have had? 

The younger part of me definitely sees therapy as a way to be loved and get the love and acceptance I don't think I got as a child. But how do I know when I am using therapy to feel good rather than to grow?

My brain definitely needs the safety and security of the therapy relationship to help me feel safe when trying things outside of therapy that trigger me. 

It is scary to invest in other relationships. Especially when I don't feel safe or comfortable in them. Or I don't feel like we have a connection. And it's just hard to right now with the lockdown.

It's like I can't make sense of what's in front of me even though I know I should be able to do it. It's like my brain just doesn't give a shit and I feel so dumb and I get really stressed and overwhelmed and very depressed. The days where I do manage to make sense of things are where I'm really kind to myself. I make sure to do something that makes me feel capable before I start work (like exercise or some chores). Everytime I find myself comparing myself to others or thinking 'why can't I do this' I take a deep breath or two, squeeze the little plush bear I have on my desk and try to talk to myself like I would a child who is struggling. Like 'hey it's okay that you're struggling with this. It doesn't need to make sense to you straight away. Let's just look at this one little bit'. And I try to remind myself that my ability to do this doesn't affect my value as a person. Doing bits of mindfulness throughout the day helps me be able to catch those thoughts.

Please be kind to yourself! Everyone has things they struggle with. And maybe see if you can talk to a psychologist?

Part of me is hurt that he hasn't made an additional appointment for me, what's another hour for him? He's probably not doing much else at the moment anyway. And I've been a regular weekly client for 18 months. I can't help but feel like if I was less stable or like I was a year ago he would have made another appointment slot for me straight away. 

I know he's demonstrating good boundaries etc. I'm just giving space for my feelings. It does make the relationship feel very uneven though. I need him and he doesn't need me. And I know that's it's good that he doesn't need me, but part of me really wants to be special to him 😔 And I think I had let that part of me believe that I was because therapy has been going well and we seem to have a great rapport.

I really wish it was easier to feel special to people. It's so hard to make friends, especially with the pandemic. Even though I'm avidly childfree my brain keeps throwing this idea around of having a kid so I can feel special. My cats do sometimes make me feel special.

TalkTherapy,fm293k0,t1_fm24vaf,1585692868.0,"So true, I wish that wasn't the case.

This is my overly simplified understanding of what therapy can be.

Your brain has a fast emotional part that is very quick to make judgements about the world around you. This is the part responsible for you going into a fight/flight/freeze response. Your brain also has a slower verbal and logical part. When things get emotional, your logical part goes offline.

Therapy can involve:

- creating a safe space where you feel accepted for who you are so you can do other things below

- becoming aware of your body, your feelings, and what 'triggers' your emotional brain to activate

- understanding why the emotional part of your brain reacts the way it does 

- practising ways to regulate that part of your brain (slow breathing, grounding exercises)

- practising sitting with uncomfortable emotions and keeping the logical brain online (distress tolerance)

- becoming aware of and understanding the thought patterns of your logical brain and where they come from

- challenging those thoughts in therapy and developing skills to allow you to challenge your automatic thoughts in the real world

- a neutral third party to discuss anything about your life that you want to

- discovering who you are underneath all the expectations that were lumped on you

- learning how to use all of the above to create better relationships irl

- internalising a caring person (the therapist) that you can draw from in times of stress

It's to help me be aware how I could be affecting other people in my life. But he always validates and explores my feelings as well.

We talked about two behaviours that came up in the theraputic relationship  My therapist gently challenged me to reflect on how those behaviours may influence other relationships outside of therapy. I noticed that if he had done the same 6 months ago I would have been really upset. It's funny how I now trust him enough and feel like he gets what is happening for me. It kind of feels like we could be on the same team who's job it is to look at, explore and challenge how I interact with myself and the world. Rather than before where it felt like I was drowning in the water and he was standing on the shore holding a life saver ring and refusing to throw it to me. 

There's been two scheduling things that have happened in the last month that in the past I would have just gotten very upset about. But I haven't this time. It's weird. Part of my brain still tried to tell me the story 'oh this is proof he doesn't care about you', but it just didn't stick or have any emotional hold over me."
TalkTherapy,fkw5dbh,t1_fkrneov,1584583834.0,Ooh I really like the idea of having something consistent for therapy time. Now I feel like I need to go and buy a special blanket or tea.
TalkTherapy,fkw53xn,t1_fkorge3,1584583663.0,Aw man I wish my appointment time was later in the day! I don't think my therapist will approve of me drinking beer at 9.30am.
TalkTherapy,fkw3xcb,t1_fku3sh4,1584582903.0,Damn that sucks 😔
TalkTherapy,fkqgkqe,t3_fjcvph,1584445079.0,"""I am looking forward to speaking with you on Thursday"" is what my T signed off an email with. There is a part of me with transference that laps this kinda stuff up. There is also a part of me that hates the part of me with transference. My T definitely puts something like that on emails to all his clients, I'm not special. Or if he doesn't, then he probably makes sure to put it on emails to me because he knows I'm sensitive to rejection and this is him appealing to my transference to keep me coming back. 

It's crazy how many stories my brain can tell myself from one simple sentence!"
TalkTherapy,fkmnum8,t3_fj95x9,1584334040.0,I've only had video sessions with my therapist when I was traveling. This is the first time that he'll see my room and potentially my cats. I'm kind of excited to share a little bit more of myself with him. I'm also kind of scared that we're not going to be able to connect as well over video chat as in person. And I'm scared that making direct eye contact will be too much and not looking at the screen will make it feel like I'm not even in a therapy session.  But I'm hopeful that it will be good enough.
TalkTherapy,fkcrdl7,t1_fkcoes9,1584059409.0,">I called him a therapy robot and he replied in a robot voice asking, ""Beep. Boop. How does that make you feel?""

😂 I love this"

TalkTherapy,fkc705a,t3_fhmixn,1584047028.0,"Ouch :(  

It is possible that she is also strapped for cash at the moment and could not afford to offer you a reduced rate?

I'm also scared of this happening to me :("
TalkTherapy,fkaalzo,t1_fk9mcxf,1583999185.0,"Man, I feel you. I used to think like this about my therapy and I remember how much it hurt. I think over time my therapist has shown me that (within the boundaries of therapy) he does care about me."
TalkTherapy,fk9d1dn,t3_ffn4gg,1583973572.0,"My T said that our conversation today was proof that I am changing because a few months ago trying to have that same conversation would have been very difficult 😊

I'm trying to let myself feel the good vibes without succumbing to the feelings of I'm so good at therapy and I have to keep making progress to have worth or for my therapist to like me"

TalkTherapy,fjxdpbf,t3_ffad9g,1583669180.0,"Oof yes. I seem to have gotten through most of the worst of those feelings and am starting to accept the time we have in therapy together as ""enough"", but every now and then I still get little waves of those feelings."
TalkTherapy,fjmrw8j,t1_fjmopye,1583481225.0,I think even thinking about bringing it up is huge progress!
TalkTherapy,fjmrlao,t3_fc4kf5,1583480853.0,Another good session! The adult part of my really appreciates my T and the younger part of me loves my T so much 😊 he is so good at validating anything i bring up and so patient when he has to piece what I mean together from the fragments of speech that are so hard to get out
TalkTherapy,fjlxrfa,t3_fdxah1,1583456934.0,"Hey y'all.

I've been in weekly therapy for about 18 months. I've been told that I may have BPD traits but my T doesn't believe diagnosises have been helpful in his experience so I say I have depression, anxiety and have issues handling my emotions and thoughts in relationships.

My posts / comments in the weekly thread are usually 'i love my T', 'I'm scared to talk about X with my T' and 'I hate my T why am I in therapy'. Sorry if I come across as predictable!

In therapy I'm learning to feel my feelings, to be vulnerable with people, to communicate more effectively, to be gentle with myself and how to regulate my emotions and tolerate distress. I'm exploring the stories/schemas/expectations I have and who the f*** I am underneath it all."
TalkTherapy,fjee1ci,t1_fjbrkcp,1583270159.0,Thank you :)

TalkTherapy,fiwql19,t3_f8jqg9,1582798303.0,"I'm really upset that I can't access the life insurance policies I want because I have ""sought treatment for anxiety, depression or stress"". Fucking what?! And the income insurance I wanted cancelled my application because I have have four issues that would need to be excluded - mental health issues and three of which are me having sustained injuries through sport (which due to how much prehab I do now mean I'm probably lower risk for injury than the average person in my sport!).

It just seems crazy to me that had I not sought treatment for my mental health or my injuries, I would mentally and physically be in a worse place than I am now but I would be able to get insured."
TalkTherapy,fivdyj2,t3_f8ngmt,1582758627.0,"My worst session was when my therapist flat out denied changing his email boundaries despite them clearly having changed. It felt like he was gaslighting me. He came from being a therapist in high performance focus and anything that came up not around performance he had to refer out, and so he had very relaxed email boundaries. Turns out I am his first very strongly attached client he has had, and he has had to renegotiate his boundaries and do some work himself. We've had some open discussions about how the boundary he felt comfortable with have oscillated, and how he was not very effective in communicating that change.

I've had so many best sessions! They all have a similar theme of me feeling heard, understood, respected and that my therapist is on my team."
TalkTherapy,fiv819a,t1_fiu6bqp,1582755522.0,No they did. It's more that what I thought was a concise and effective way to communicate something was actually not very effective (and a bit confrontational).
