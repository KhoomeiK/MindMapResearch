notliketheothergirls,fmmpa6t,t3_fvxqvp,1586209490.0,"People who hate on fake nails need to take a long hard look at themselves. Clearly they hate their own nails if they must constantly create memes about what other people's nails look like. Congratulations you love to look natural. I dont see negative self righteous memes about women who choose to have a more natural aesthetic. I can cook, sew, make fire, shoot a gun, and anything else with long fake nails. They look cool as shit. Like dragon claws covered in glitter. To me ""low maintenance "" really means ""lack of creativity"" because I do my own nails and I took the time and effort to learn how to care for myself in a self sufficient and affordable way."

I have used it for years and also have very fair skin and it has helped even out my skin tone. And you don't have to use it everyday take it slow to see how your skin reacts to it like once a week at first then over time you can use almost daily.  But if you use it on areas that will get sunshine use sunscreen because you will get sunburned more easily.
beauty,ez25610,t3_czov5x,1567652731.0,"Google ""kojic acid soap"" it's made from rice and will lighten dark skin over time. It's very affordable and used all over Asia. I get mine from Amazon. Make sure you watch some YouTube videos on how to use it properly. And always moisturize after washing."
