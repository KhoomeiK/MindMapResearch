When you make the jump to dev within your current company, you have the existing company knowledge you mentioned, but you also have relationships with individuals who might be willing to mentor you. It can make the transition much smoother when you have dev work friends willing to help you and boost you.

this.  if you can tolerate it, stay w/ your current company and try to get them to move you to the dev team, even if you split time between teams.  the mentorship and experience you'll get will go a long way toward  getting you to your next role at a new company.  it is not super easy to get a role as a brand new dev w/ no practical experience.  if you and another more experienced dev are up for the same role, the job will likely go to a more experienced person."

macbookair,fjkyulf,t3_fdw3t8,1583436611.0,"what are you running that you think is running badly? are you running more than one cpu intensive app at a time?  you only have 8GB of RAM from what i can tell.   if you are running more than one resource intensive app at a time, you will most definitely see some slow down. also, you cannot compare your macbook pro with a macbook air. different entities altogether regardless of year."
