bicycling,fq3sr9p,t1_fq3sekp,1589069805.0,"Thanks, I'll definitely be taking it to a bike shop. Ordered bike online thinking it would be easy to put together but it seems like it'll be a bit more involved than I estimated."

bicycling,fq3rri7,t1_fq3kwhe,1589069431.0,Thanks for the straight answer. Figured that was the case but wanted to confirm.
bicycling,fq3rnco,t1_fq3l32x,1589069396.0,Good one.
consulting,foozks9,t1_fooxxed,1587949821.0,Client never got back to me. Chalked it up as a loss but a valuable learning lesson.
consulting,fmwr9ig,t1_fmu0kkf,1586451622.0,"Thanks, this makes sense. I responded late afternoon yesterday and let the client know that I want to understand the specific scope of the work so I can figure out the amount of work, time, and proper cost involved. Ready to walk away if what he's asking for seems unrealistic or unfair."
consulting,fmwr1fa,t1_fmtny28,1586451509.0,"Thanks, I appreciate your response. I responded late afternoon yesterday. I'm ready to negotiate but am also willing to walk away if what he's asking for seems unrealistic or if he's not willing to pay a fair market rate."
consulting,fmwqmaz,t1_fmukj2i,1586451296.0,"Thanks, this really helps. I responded to the client yesterday late afternoon. Hope we can find some resolution but I'm also willing to walk away if it seems like what he wants is unrealistic or if he's not willing to pay market value."
consulting,fmtlyki,t1_fmq8iz4,1586375008.0,So client got back to me this afternoon and stated that he did get sticker shock and claims my proposal was a whopping 3-4x what he was anticipating. He is asking how I think we should proceed. Any recommendations for how to proceed?

consulting,fmtd8ly,t1_fmrw5py,1586370773.0,"So there's no travel in this role. Most travel I'd have to do is going into their office, 15 minutes down the road, but with what's going on right now, I'd likely be working from home during the duration of my contract.

Yeah, it comes out to about $115 an hour, which is a little over the 1.5x FTE salary that other contractors who I'm friends with had recommended as an hourly wage."
consulting,fmqi7qk,t1_fmqhvpl,1586300106.0,"For 4 market research documents and 3 sales enablement videos, I am proposing approximately $40k, and am estimating they will take me about 9 weeks to complete. I based my number on the salary for the position they were initially hiring for, plus estimated benefits. It's a high number, no doubt about it, but I've worked in this company's industry for multiple years so have a leg up on others in that respect."
consulting,fmqht63,t1_fmqfx4u,1586299882.0,Number? You mean how much did I price my services at?
consulting,fmq5lzm,t1_fmpw7z7,1586293297.0,"Thank you, this is helpful. Do you think it's too late to a conversation to negotiate rates and timelines?"
consulting,fmpgmgh,t1_fmpffug,1586280480.0,"No travel required for this role, particularly right now given the state of affairs. I should have asked about budget. I didn't think to since they'd asked me for a proposal but it would have been smart."
consulting,fmpgisf,t1_fmpdpkn,1586280431.0,"Well, I kind of am an amateur in this case. This is my first time sending a contracting proposal. My thought was to follow up and ask if I could go through the proposal with the client. I want to let them know I am open for negotiation."
consulting,fmpge12,t1_fmpdj9h,1586280365.0,"No specific timeline was given. I did not make it obvious in the proposal that what I was proposing was up for negotiation, but I did state in my email to the client that I am happy to address any questions or concerns. My thought was that I would reach out tomorrow afternoon and follow up on my email with what you've described. We had an excellent rapport, and I am very open to negotiating and being flexible to what the client's needs are."
depression,fkxnm2p,t3_fl010g,1584631849.0,"Hey, I hear you. Currently unemployed and depressed and had been putting off therapy for too long, until I made some calls a couple weeks ago and finally got a couple to call me back. It takes effort. I set up an appointment with one and then the coronavirus hit and he offered either phone or Skype therapy.   


So, the good news is there is teletherapy. Definitely not the same as being in the same room as a therapist, but it's better than nothing! If you need a referral to someone, let me know and I can give you his name."
Crypto_com,fhv9ed5,t1_fhuvom5,1581894829.0,"Yes, I was aware of the whole market being down. So why is that down? I can't seem to find much info."

Crypto_com,fhu57wi,t1_fhu4hzv,1581882125.0,"Sorry, I guess I should have been more specific. On Feb 13th, the price of MCO hit $6.35. Today, the price hit $5.31. That's a nearly 20% drop. I'm smoking some good $hit but the question is pretty clear."

CoinBase,eteegsq,t1_ete6iqw,1562730347.0,Check this thread out: https://twitter.com/WietseWind/status/1103206632505466880
CoinBase,etecnzi,t1_ete5ujv,1562728870.0,"Hmm. Not sure what action to take with that. In any event, there are scores of folks - you and I included - who have had similar issues with Coinbase. It's frustrating but I am wondering if we can all join in and expose them via a media outlet. Twitter is a good start but it would be more powerful coming from a news source."
CoinBase,etdexuz,t1_et8gado,1562705231.0,"That's unreal. What's amazing is that their user agreement reads, ""We securely store Digital Currency private keys, which are used to process transactions, in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result of our security protocols, it may be necessary for us to retrieve private keys or related information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Currency Transfers in accordance with your instructions, and you acknowledge that this may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Currency Transfers."" Sounds like they have access to the private key to me."
CoinBase,erpvqxz,t1_erpvg7a,1561129155.0,Got it. Is there anything I can do with that information?
CoinBase,erpu4ki,t1_erp8562,1561128058.0,"Thanks, trying my hardest."

CoinBase,eroqbzs,t1_eroq4lu,1561085810.0,"I see. If that's the case, it strikes me as odd that the addresses don't have a unique identifier built in to classify it as BTC vs USDT vs Coinbase vs whatever. There has to be a way to prevent these types of things from happening."
CoinBase,eropv6r,t1_eropd9l,1561085451.0,">Got it, this is helpful so thank you. By the sound of it, moving up the customer service chain of command at Coinbase is critical, so that is my goal for now. If that proves to be a fruitless measure, then I'll seek legal guidance."

CoinBase,eronvjr,t1_eron59q,1561083934.0,"Thanks. Both Binance and Coinbase show the TXID so the withdrawal and ""reception"" note is showing up in both respective dashboards. I'd also mention that, when I click on the ""recent activity"" tab in my Coinbase dashboard, it reads ""Unable to decode output address"" in reference to the Binance (USDT) output."

CoinBase,eron2mx,t1_eromhkz,1561083336.0,"Got it. I found this link ([https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/wiki/I-sent-tokens-to-an-incompatible-wallet-such-as-Coinbase-or-GDAX.-Can-you-reverse-the-transaction%3F](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/wiki/I-sent-tokens-to-an-incompatible-wallet-such-as-Coinbase-or-GDAX.-Can-you-reverse-the-transaction%3F)) which says that if the private key is not made available, then ""to reach out to the support team for the owner/operator of the wallet or service provider that controls the receiving destination and request their assistance in a recovery process."" Github is claiming they ""are more than willing to work with them and you to assist in the technical details, but since the destination in questions is controlled by an external party, the Omni team can only guide the process, if they are willing to cooperate."" So apparently Github can help? Somehow?   


I've responded back to Coinbase's response asking to speak with a manager. We'll see where that goes. If they give me another ""we can't help you"" response, I may decide to pursue some form of legal action."

CoinBase,eromm7q,t1_eromaue,1561082990.0,"It's a BTC address. I transferred it there because I was informed I needed to sell my USDT through a crypto wallet, and I'd already had a Coinbase account set up. I figured (as I said, like a newb) that the funds would be converted from USDT to BTC. Didn't seem so confusing to me at the time as it seemed like the only option to recover my funds back into my bank account."
CoinBase,erom5q1,t1_eroltjq,1561082647.0,Not sure I want to toss the deposit address on here. Why do you ask?
CoinBase,erom4fd,t1_erolr9z,1561082618.0,"I know, I absolutely should have done that. And not to say I don't deserve at least some of the blame, but there really should be a safeguard in place on Binance (and others) to stop people from transferring funds to a Bitcoin (or other service) given it will just evaporate. These organizations should have a responsibility to ensure their customers don't make a massive mistake like this."
CoinBase,erolzlj,t1_erolp8s,1561082515.0,Thanks! Definitely horrifying. This type of situation shouldn't even be possible. The system really needs better safeguards. Pretty sure nobody can argue with that.
CoinBase,erolhyh,t1_erokgrw,1561082146.0,"Damn, that sucks! For the life of me, I cannot believe there are no safeguards against this type of thing. I've seen commentary on here that ""well, the responsibility lies with the individual,"" which is fair but there still needs to be some sort of way to recover funds in instances like this. How can money just disappear?"
