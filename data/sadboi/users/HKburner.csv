AmItheAsshole,fm9u2ri,t1_fm9sim6,1585876588.0,"Clearly that's not the case here, also you are talking about a paltry amount of money in that example.

OP's case involves a very significant amount of money and also knowledge that the seller did not do enough research. OP has admitted that he knew the seller was simply mistaken when the seller told him that all he did was look up telecasters. To know the value of a guitar you need to be an expert or have it appraised, but not everyone would know that. There are also so many variables that can affect the value and again, you'd need to be an expert to pick those out, yet most people wouldn't know that. If I was selling my dads items, I also might be a little hasty in my research as frankly, selling his items off would be upsetting.

OP knew that the seller needed to do more research but made no attempt to let him know and jumped at the price. He had another opportunity to be fair when the seller approached him after the sale, but the OP basically told him to piss off instead of trying to find some middle ground.

I guess we just have a different moral compass. I would not knowingly rip someone off if I knew they were unaware of the value of an item."

You're still brainwashed mate. I've lived in China for many many years and 99% of the fuckups can be attributed to the CCP, not foreign intervention. The corruption that's rampant in China does not come from foreigners (even though in rare cases some foreigners have conducted business corruptly), it all comes from within. Your government tells you its all the foreigners fault because they've never taken responsibility for anything. They fear losing face to an extreme level that results in lies and corruption. Have you ever heard the expression that ""shit trickles down from the top""?

爱国≠爱党

Edit: Another note... China is still a 3rd world country in some ways due to it's own fear of losing face. You spend billions on things like the Olympics when you still have people in Gansu living in houses with dirt floors. How's that anyone's fault but the CCP?"

It is both easier and less time consuming for her to call him via the app rather than incorrectly ask for a confirmation code which isn't a thing within Uber. If youre a professional you dont just use alternative terms. An order number is an order number and a confirmation code is a confirmation code, it's entirely possible that both can be on an order for an item so I dont blame him at all for asking her where to check. That's another point, he asked her flat out where to check the code and she did not clarify, how hard is it to say sorry I meant the order number and you can check via so and so? She offered no real help to rectify the situation at all.

The button to call is literally on the main page of the app. It's so easy to call that the vast majority of drivers do so on every single delivery. If she couldn't manage that, then this is not the job for her."
