Testosterone,f84j839,t1_f83lb3f,1574251049.0,"Everybody is different and operates best at their optimum levels. My doctor seems to think that self confidence type issues are also a cause of low T in men. 

From what I’ve seen in this reddit most doctors stay away from TrT and the hardest thing is finding one that knows what they are doing. Most won’t treat it if you’re anywhere in the “range”. Maybe it’s because they don’t know enough about it, they’re afraid of the liability, or they don’t want to take the time to legitimately help 1 person so they can meet their patient quotas. 

If you decide to pursue TrT, don’t expect it to be a miracle cure all for you. It might help with everything, it might just clear your head and give you some drive."

Parenting,f80mbb4,t3_dy8urd,1574132483.0,"Father to a 21 month old son, 10+ years with depression. Your son wants and understands only a few things at this point. The biggest of his concerns are hunger, sleep, warmth and clean diapers. You will experience preferential treatment from your son in the coming months but he isn’t trying to manipulate you yet, and there isn’t anything personal to him wanting mom over you. It will likely change back and forth over time. 

I’d encourage you to be as present as possible in the caretaking duties of diaper changes, bathing, bottle feeding, etc. Try to take joy in little victories like rocking him to sleep, making it through a book, laying on the floor next to him and just be present. 

Depression of any kind is real. My son has saved my life because I don’t want him to grow up fatherless. I applaud you for taking steps towards your own mental health. It’s a really hard first step to take. If you don’t have one, I’d encourage you to find a psychiatrist and a therapist. 

Fatherhood is the most difficult and the most rewarding thing for me. I hope you find it to be a blessing as you make it through the daily struggles."
