Since I have you, would Khan academy then be recognized as a replacement for generalized education? Thanks for replying, I'm new to the sub and don't have a firm grasp on the ideals of the people here. Also, I liked the meme just want sure about the little things about it."
Anarcho_Capitalism,fjy3397,t1_fjvu3v6,1583688851.0,"Well I was really hoping you could provide some genuine insight on a solution to that. If EVERYONE did have internet this would be pretty cool, however that is not the case. I didn't think that such a massive loophole wouldn't have a suggested solution."
Anarcho_Capitalism,fjy1qyc,t1_fjxg269,1583688083.0,"Idk, I guess it depends on your priorities, I didn't used to have internet or anything you could use internet on, for about three years. I mean, food and rent was pretty high up on the list so maybe I'm the weird one."

Edit: you're right I don't have a ton of MK."
btd6,fc1qf8b,t1_fc1n2eg,1577326440.0,On CHIMPS I just start with either ninja or obyn and save up for a super after getting the ninja to about 3-0-1 from there it's rushing the super to 2-0-3 and adding in a berserker brew and 2-4-0 engineer. After that upgrade the super monkey once and coast.

bipolar,euum1ih,t3_chg0ps,1564046797.0,"For me that's totally normal, I've been off meds more  than on them and it's harder to manage because of the constant mixed episodes and volatile mood. You aren't alone with this and if you want to try to get a more recognise able pattern try a mood tracker. It may seem random but for me there's usually a larger overlaying mood. I would go see a different doctor, maybe one who gives more suggestions instead of denying you. I've gone through a few that thought I was 'just being hormonal.'
