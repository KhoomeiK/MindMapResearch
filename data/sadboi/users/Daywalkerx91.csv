ChildrenofDeadParents,fljt9g0,t3_fp7d45,1585225884.0,"Hey there, lost my dead to a heart attack when I was 6 as well, now 28. Seeing my fathers blue face / corpse really bashed me out of a normal, emotional reality. A few hours after his death I just stopped crying because my body started to protect myself from most feelings towards my family. At this point my brother (3 years older) began to say I am sick in the head and I did not love my father, otherwise I would keep crying like a normal person.

Kind of what you do not want to hear hours after your father literally died.

Kept going on like this and I drove more and more into a mix between a sociopath, a psychopath, a zynical asshole and a really decent and nice guy. I have been mamas little sunshine before his death and the families anger issue after his death, leading to both described sides of my character. 

I am really sure that only a true love (for a lover, not a family member) will break my shell which will come with free hours of crying and shouting and lying on the floor and being miserable. 

All in all I can understand you since what happened destroyed me for a lifetime without seeing any light at the horizon since I have not find the love of my life so far (suprising, isn't it?!).

What I do about it: all my friends and part of my family know that I see myself in such light. They know that I think I am one step from total insanity. This at least leads to more or less meaningful and honest relationships.

So yeah, no, pain does not just heal by time, I feel you there."

Also I am glad you have the strength to actually lose the respect - lots of people I know are not able to feel that way towards their parents, even if they should to protect themselves.
