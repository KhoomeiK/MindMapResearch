If you are jail broken use unsub or anything that blocks substrate tweaks in app. Also only use the official app from the AppStore.

Snap never goes straight to a perm ban. So if uve been banned before and this is the final one, your shit outta luck.

If u think you didn’t do anything wrong, shoot em an email and they should be able to tell u ur offense.
