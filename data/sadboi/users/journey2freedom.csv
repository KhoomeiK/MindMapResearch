Do you know my fear? I was abused since primary school so overeating or pill popping to lose weight is all I know. I‚Äôm just scared I won‚Äôt snap out of it soon. I‚Äôm 27... no SO, kids... nothing. Sure I‚Äôm not ready but a big part of that is because of how I look and feel about myself. I‚Äôd be really sad to be abused emotionally because of that. I once lived with this French guy who would make me feel like shit for eating. If I mad a smoothie he‚Äôd be like ‚Äúare you going to drink all of that?‚Äù Etc etc. It hurt more because I like him but he wouldn‚Äôt look at me. I was fat and ugly. Lol, funny because I was much smaller then compared to now."

I really like what I am doing but maybe I am too sensitive because he will be smiling with all, I ask him something and he won‚Äôt even look at my face or acknowledge me. I‚Äôm really shocked. It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt take people not liking me but it just feels so weird. What could I have possibly have done to make him behave so cold? Since the very first day he was uninterested."

Hmmm sad. I just don‚Äôt like it as much."
Christianity,f8qdr6n,t1_f8lw2fv,1574716100.0,"No and yes.

Yes and no.

No.

I feel like I am struggling. This new job seems harder than it needs to be. I feel super incompetent and it‚Äôs awkward. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt do the simplest of things. Maybe I am being harsh on myself but I am not really looking forward to going into work as much. 

It‚Äôs only been 2 months!!! It‚Äôs insane."
