I have been trying to justify relapsing on drugs for the past week, i.e. Do I really want to, no, but then a part of me wants to and then I get trapped in an endless loop. I guess I just need to sit on my hands and hope this stay in place order is lifted soon"

I have bizarre sleep patterns, hallucinations while drifting off and horrid dreams but the other stuff has dwindled down over the past 10 months. Delusions and whatnot happen occasionally, but I have the added benefit of being in alcoholics anonymous where that stuff is deemed normal and a phone call to someone else solves the issue by talking it through logically. 

Good luck in your endeavors."

Basically, when I drink I tend to future trip and think about all the awful shit that could happen but in reality is not happening. It does NO good to be in that place. My suggestion to you is to put the liquor down, see your therapist on days that you don't want to and tell them exactly what you are saying here. You have to be willing to change, or you'll be stuck in the cycle that you are predicting. This is all from my own personal experience."

I stepped outside to vape for a few minutes and tweedle dee/tweedle dumb starting chatting in my head. They started discussing how they did not approve of Nancy Pelosi. The funny part is that I watch absolutely nothing to do with politics, do not read political stuff and rarely....and I mean rarely discuss politics with anyone. It's actually a huge stressor for me to get involved with anything political. I told the group I was having dinner with about it, mostly democrats, and they all got a huge chuckle out of it."

Comparitvely: I no longer believe that I will be deported and tortured in another country. My voices are few and far between. Repeating music in my head has become less frequent. 

Every once in a while, like a glitch in the matrix, I relapse for a few seconds or more. I'll take that any day over what I was going through."
