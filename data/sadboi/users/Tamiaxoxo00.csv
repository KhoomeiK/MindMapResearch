>Try doing it by consulting first with a local victim advocacy group, or getting any kind of free consult with a lawyer (or at least advice).

TrueOffMyChest,fkbw533,t1_fkbut9a,1584041024.0,"I'm saying you're not empathic because you just called me stupid in your previous comment. Although you may think that I'm making bad decisions it doesn't mean I'm dumb and I'm not.

I didn't get new followers from making my post and getting new followers wasn't my intention or want. The only people who really saw my post were the followers I already had and really the majority of them probably didn't see this.

I already knew that going into this posting it could hurt a future case, but I didn't plan on making one because like I said, I can't handle it. 

I don't really understand what you're saying about no case and a potential case. I can't really make other people press charges, but if you're saying that attempting to press charges may help future cases than yes that's true. Since making this post I've decided to get more information about reporting and if I can at least have my report in the system so if other people report at least this be evidence that there's other victims. If that's how that works, I'll do it.
This will be my final reply to your comments because you seem to be ignorant, mean, and misunderstanding what I'm saying."
TrueOffMyChest,fkbug80,t1_fkbtfw6,1584040097.0,"I mentioned in another comment that I went to the police in the past about this specific rape and they did not believe me so it's not far fetched for me to believe that they wouldn't care now especially when I've seen them do the same to someone with the same exact evidence as me. If you knew about the problems rape victims face, you'd know that problems with the police are very common and dealing with them is usually very traumatic for them. I don't feel that I'm emotionally in a place where i can deal with the police again as I feel very close to suicide. I went to social media because I wanted people to know about what happened to me and for people to know about the kind of person he is because he WILL RAPE AGAIN. It's important. 
You're obviously not hearing what I'm saying and don't know much about this topic. I don't know why people like you want to put people like me down and misinterpret things, and even though I'm explaining this to you as simply as I can you probably still won't be empathic. I can accept that I can't change that.

It seems manipulative to me for her to try to convince him that he's the jerk in this situation when all he was trying to do was protect his child.

A lot of times when anyone is raped they feel like it's their fault no matter what the circumstances are. I think society has a lot of do with this because they tell you that you have to fight back and act like rape is usually avoidable, but a lot of people get raped unfortunately. It's never your fault, the blame should always be placed on the abuser because they're the terrible one in the situation. You did nothing wrong and it might help to think about how if it was someone else you wouldn't blame them for what happened. That same compassion you'd give a stranger or friend in the same situation should be given to yourself. No one deserves to be raped and although some dumb people believe that men can't be raped they definitely can. No matter what your gender is rape is never your fault.

I can't speak for the experience of men really, but from what I've experienced I felt the same about how women are treated. I feel like the world in general is awful and no one cares about other people. There are definitely areas where men are treated worse. Like when women are raped a lot of people don't care and the police don't care. It's awful, but I know it has to be even worse for men. A lot of people don't want to hear about other people's experiences or give real support but I'm sure it has to be even harder for men. The whole idea that men are strong and don't need help or support really hurts them and I think that view really factors into the problem here.

It's important for people who haven't been raped to know that this happens and maybe through talking about it we can stop the stereotypes and they can get support."
rape,eu6icsd,t3_cdzsw5,1563500985.0,"I don't think it can be fixed. You'll never be able to forget what he did and you never know if he'll do it again. You'll end up living in fear. I don't think it's possible to stay in a relationship with someone who raped you and it wouldn't be worth it to try. I can say that I went back to my ex after he raped me.. And he did it again. I don't believe rapist change, they just get better at hiding it."
rape,eu6fz4q,t1_eu40yxz,1563499447.0,What are you saying exactly?
TrueOffMyChest,eu6ep4h,t1_eu65wzy,1563498597.0,I think r/offmychest doesn't allow people to post about rape in general. Someone in the rape subredit was complaining about their post getting taken down on multiple different subs and I think that one was one of them. I could be wrong though.

rape,etrtjvp,t1_etr4boa,1563128806.0,"She didn't ask to be interrogated, she's asking for advice. I feel like this isn't a place to question people's stories.
Yes the police would probably ask these kinds of questions but she never said if she wanted to go to the police or not. She doesn't have to if she didn't want to. 
The first step OP is to tell someone you trust, you shouldn't have to go through this alone."

lonely,etnsijp,t1_etnrs7q,1562998610.0,"There's one friend that I tell about it sometimes but there's not much he can do. I don't really know why I feel that way or how someone could help me. 
I also feel like I'm too depressed and suicidal to make new friends. It doesn't seem right or worth it."
rape,etg0iac,t1_etfxcpu,1562781390.0,"That's unfortunate, but I get it. I hope you're able to get it soon."
rape,etf327s,t1_eterhjh,1562758345.0,"I'm sorry, I know that had to be heartbreaking. Your ""friends"" sound very ignorant. People deal with tramua in different ways and it's normal to feel or appear numb about it. They probably weren't your friends to begin with because I feel like any decent person would automatically believe their friend especially about something so serious as this. I know it may be hard but know that you deserve to be heard and that your friends were wrong for not believing you. Have you thought about telling a family member or seeing a therapist?"
SuicideWatch,etdiq5y,t3_cb3n4l,1562707545.0,"I haven't done it because I'm staying alive for my dog. Once he's gone, I plan to leave too."
rape,etdhyd4,t3_cawjxm,1562707048.0,"That's definitely rape. You can always withdrawn consent at any time. I'm sorry this happened to you and it's not your fault. A very similar situation happened to me with my ex and afterwards I felt like it was my fault. I blamed myself because he tried to sexual assualt me a week before, but regardless of the situation it's never your fault. The only person responsible is the rapist. It might be helpful to tell a trusted friend or family member so you don't have to be alone in this. You can also talk to me if you like."
TrueOffMyChest,etd5tuv,t3_cb187f,1562699788.0,"I personally like them because it's something to listen to while I'm doing something, but you're right. It is very low effort and it suprises me that they're able to monetize their videos. I did try to stop watching them, but once you watch one your whole recommended page is filed with them and a bunch of new ones are released everyday."
unpopularopinion,esjbhle,t3_c813z6,1562029803.0,"I completely agree with this. My job was like this and I just never understood it. The bathrooms were exactly the same and sometimes I had to tell customers there's no need to wait, the ""men's"" bathroom is almost always empty."
