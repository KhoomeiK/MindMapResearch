They were pretty obviously huge but since guys do like to exaggerate, I had playfully teased them both during our respective relationships that 9 inches was awfully unlikely, that maybe they were 7 and a half. They both measured. One was 9inches and one was just a little over 9 inches. (Many Harry Potter jokes were made when I started referring to the latter one as 9 & 3 quarters. 

I don't feel like OP should let himself feel concerned about the size of exes though. Like men and their penises, women have different depths to our vaginas, and even for those with more shallow vaginas, it doesn't mean they don't enjoy larger dicks and those with deep vaginas may enjoy shorter dicks. 
Different positions can make a lot of difference as well. 

Of course, for a lot of women, it's about who is attached to that penis. 

 While I had some great sex with both of the 9's, the best sex I ever had was with my last ex who was 6 and a half and if I had the option of choosing one of the three of them to have sex with again, it would 100% be the 6.5 inch guy."

However, I don't believe that's what most of Robin's grieving fans are suggesting or implying. I also think that claiming his depression had absolutely nothing to do with his suicide is extremely naive and completely false and I will explain why. 

First, Robin did not **KNOW** he had Lewy Body Dementia. That was not discovered until his autopsy. The diagnosis he **DID** have prior to his death was of Parkinson's disease, a condition which, as it progresses, 
causes not only the tremors most people are familiar with. It also causes slowing and stiffness in one's movements, causes severe problems in maintaining balance and  causes the neurons responsible for Dopamine-production to die. 

As defined by sciencedaily.com, *Dopamine is a so-called messenger substance or neurotransmitter that conveys signals between neurons. It not only controls mental and emotional responses but also motor reactions. Dopamine is particularly known as being the ""happy hormone."" It is responsible for our experiencing happiness.* 

This is especially important for people who are known to struggle with depression and anxiety. Having the ability to trigger those specific neurons to fire are just one way we are able to cope with depression. 

Now, considering that Robin had spoken openly in the past about his struggles with depression, and his own claim of struggling with severe depression just a month before his death, that alone should be an obvious sign that depression played into why he made the choice he did. 

Robin's entire career and his brilliant ability to entertain us all had much to do with the fluidity with which he moved, hand gestures and raising the energy in the room by getting everyone else moving in any audience. His amazing control over his own body during performances made his career what it was, especially in the beginning. Parkinson's would have meant losing so much of that. 

Robin knew about the Parkinson's and what it would gradually do to him and it most definitely affected his depression. Imagine how he must have felt knowing he would begin to lose so much of what and who he was."

Now, the dad cheated on his wife, they divorced and he has since married the girl who was a Freshman when his son and I were sophomore and Senior class in high school. They constantly go on expensive vacations, close up the shop and all that.

She had been abandoned, definitely neglected and while she had no physical injuries, she has definitely shown serious signs of being verbally abused and definitely beat on at some point. 

It's been almost 3 months and she is just flourishing now, but there are still moments when she suddenly becomes terrified and it makes me so sick and angry that anyone ever made her feel afraid. 

Last week, I was sitting on the edge of my bed, scratching her behind the ears because she just loves it so much. Since I was leaning down, my hair fell in my face so I brought my hand up just long enough to brush it behind my ear. She immediately dropped to the floor, cowered and trembling all over. 

I'm not supposed to get down on the floor because with my spine issues, it can become so difficult and so painful trying to get back up. I didn't think about it at all and still would have slid down next to her even if I had. 

I got all the way down, laying on my side and just stroked her back and head until she started to relax and lean against me. 

It's little unexpected moments like that which just makes me feel rage in my stomach and devastated that I can't save every animal that is abused.

This is what happens when an individual not only fails to read scripture themselves but blindly believes whatever their church head tells them it says and what it means. 

I don't personally put the same stock in the bible that I do in my own religious beliefs. The concept of following a book that has been translated, rewritten, edited, rewritten again, retranslated again thousands of times by Church heads and Kings doesn't seem to really be following the word of God at all. That's especially true when you consider that as far as our knowledge goes, the original Bible was written in original Arabic, a long dead language, and as that Bible does not exist today nor does anyone with any knowledge of the language, no one could read it if it did exist. 

That's not to say I *haven't* read the Bible as it now reads. I don't believe in making claims of what is in the book or what every verse means without knowing myself what they say. However, I read it only once in 2009 when I needed to find meaning in my life and hoped to find it there."

Just before he quit, he stomped back to the office one day to complain to management that they kept calling him a homosapien. Apparently the look on the manager's face was pretty great and IIRC she told him what the word meant. I'm not sure though. 

I refuse to feel bad for the guy whining that he was *being bullied* though. We had another dude on crew who had one hand that hadn't grown right when he was born and so it was malformed. The pig-faced Homosapien thought it was funny to call that guy *Nemo.*

Arat has a Dad helping him do things he really seems to want to do on his own, in a controlled environment in the safety of their home. 

He's not climbing the highest on a tree that he can and then jumping off to see if he can land on his feet or how high he can jump from and land without breaking something.

I remember being so relieved that my Dad thought the same as I did and made it clear he didn't care if anyone else thought he should know or not. If no one else was going to tell him, he would. 

I had planned the same thing in my head and was so anxious about sitting down at only 14 to tell my 70+ Grandpa that he was sick. I was never so relieved that my Dad and his oldest brothers made sure he knew. I have no idea how I would have stomached that conversation"

One example for you: Many people in the world have themselves listed as an organ donor should something fatal happen to them. That's a decision each person makes for themselves. However, whomever you have listed as your medical proxy/power of attorney gets the final say in whether your organs can be removed and donated if you are no longer able to speak for yourself.

These are 18 year olds that are throwing themselves into the world and experiencing the worst of it. They can smoke and wvwn drink while they're deployed but they better not think about doing either of those things on U.S. soil.

aww,fqkpo1t,t1_fqk1aa8,1589432892.0,"I'm definitely concerned about the cat. I have 3, including one that looks very similar to this one, only mine is fatter. 

Two of the three are middle aged cats and the third is 1 year and 8 months old. I would fully expect the youngest to jump out but at the same time, he's a chicken shit. He whines constantly at our windows because our bird feeders out front are always full. However, he never pushes on or scratches at the screen when the windows are open and if a bird flies too close to the window, or slams into it, this cat will leap behind a decorative statue we have in the Bay window, behind one of the other cats or behind the section of wall between the windows. So, maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't. 

The two older boys are both pretty nosy and if the car was stopped, I would fully expect to see the oldest make a jump for it. My nosy little furball would absolutely have to gently slide his way down the outside of the door as far as he could then leap for the ground from a shorter height."
