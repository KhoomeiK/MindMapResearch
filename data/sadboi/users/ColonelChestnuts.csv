The unfortunate consequence is that there is now more to lose. And if your biggest fear is being abandoned, the more there is to lose, the more scared you are of being abandoned. It defies all logic, the closer you are to someone, the more you know them, the less you should be scared of them leaving you, since they have also invested in you.

When I was in the absolute depths of my depressive period, he was the only thing that made me even remotely happy, and every day I would wait for that one message just to feel an inkling of something resembling happiness, and when that message didn't come, or came too late, I would spiral into anxiety and paranoia. I am now considerably more stable, and I think I miss that thrill, I miss that anxiety, I miss him being the only thing that gave me happiness. Which is probably incredibly self-destructive. Atm I'm keeping busy with university stuff (which I have fallen behind on due to the aforementioned reasons) and other things, and generally I'm feeling less awful. Maybe it's just I've been depressed for so long, and have relied on him as my only support for so long, that my feelings have not actually diminished, but are no longer totally overwhelming because they are not the only and sole thing that occupies my mind.

BPD,faroxta,t3_eaea34,1576318504.0,"Something my psychologist told me which might be useful: the amygdala is the part of our brain responsible for recognising threats, it's therefore responsible not only for our flght or flight mechanism but also our anxiety. The frontal lobe is responsible for rational thinking, soothing ourselves etc. Our brain can't really recognise if a situation which provokes anxiety (like your FP not responding to your message) is a life-or-death situation or not. When the brain detects a situation like this, it activates the amygdala, and the connection between the frontal lobe (the part responsible for rational thinking) and the rest of the brain is literally severed when the amygdala is activated. The brain treats your FP not responding to messages the same way it would treat a predator hunting you. When your FP doesn't message you back, the rational part of your brain is literally turned off. DBT and other forms of therapy are there to teach the brain to not do that, and the more times you don't succumb to your impulses, the easier it gets for the brain to recognise that your FP not responding is not the same as a predator hunting you. These therapies help you turn that rational part of your brain back on before you do something stupid.

I'm sure I bungled the neuropsychology here, but it certainly helped me to understand that this anxiety and paranoia is involuntary, but that the pathways in the brain can be changed."

We've been ""together"" (feels weird saying that about a relationship that's mostly long-distance) for nearly 8 months and I understand what he does and generally what I can expect from him, I'm just looking for a deeper understanding of why he does it. His alexithymia makes it difficult for him to explain, so I'm looking in other places. Sometimes it can be difficult for both of us (especially since I'm not entirely mentally sound), and I think we try our best to understand each other, but being with someone who doesn't really understand their emotions/can't express them can be quite confusing. Unfortunately, I think I have BPD (as you can tell from my post history) and sometimes it is difficult not to feel anxious when we don't speak for a long time, but generally speaking I've found that the more I respect his wishes not to be contacted, the more he talks to me when he does feel talkative.

BPD,f9n0vr3,t1_f9mzw0y,1575474580.0,"One tip I have. Stop drinking. I know it's very difficult, but quitting drinking has really helped me. I used to drink a lot to cope with anxiety and paranoia, and it worked for a while, but alcohol does change the chemical balance in your brain. Eventually I realised that being drunk actually made my symptoms worse because it swept away any inhibitions I had. So if I was paranoid when sober, there's at least a 50/50 chance I won't sent my bf some insane message. If I am drunk and get paranoid, there's a 100% chance I will send him that message. It can really fuck up your relationship, especially if the other person doesn't drink as much as you, or even worse, not at all. 

In terms of controlling my emotions, I find venting somewhere else to be a good step. This subreddit is a good place, people here are very supportive, and if you have any friends who are willing to listen to your paranoia, that's really good too. Although you don't want to overdo it with friends either, because eventually they'll get sick of you too. And of course, the best place to vent is therapy. 

You are correct about medication. Getting the right medication is super important. Currently I'm waiting for a psychiatrist, but I'm on citalopram, and while that's not a BPD medication but merely an antidepressant, it still helps with obsessive thoughts and anxiety. So it works quite well, although I probably need mood stabilisers as well. I assume you're in the UK, since you say A&E, well in that case you know how slow the NHS can be."
BPD,f9mwzog,t3_e5ztbk,1575472116.0,"My bf/FP has Aspergers. It can be very difficult, especially if he's run out of social energy and I really want to talk to him. It can lead to anxiety/paranoia. However, as we become more experienced in our relationship, things get better. I find that if I respect his boundaries (for example by not sending him long messages and asking difficult questions when he tells me he cannot talk), he's much more receptive and affectionate when he does want to talk, and he wants to talk more often. I was at my lowest BPD/depression ebb until a few weeks ago, and I really started fucking up our relationship, in fact I tried to end it 3 times in the space of a month, understandably this meant he had distanced himself from me somewhat. It's very difficult to control myself, and I still fail quite often, but the more I control myself, the better the relationship gets. For 2 weeks I've been mostly able to control the worst of my symptoms (thanks antidepressants) and things have improved immeasurably in a very short space of time. What is most important for me now is to try and not overwhelm him with my emotions and to make him feel comfortable with me.

Ultimately a person with Aspergers is not like any other person, and they won't be able to do some things that NT's see as 'normal' in a relationship. You're likely not going to hold hands/kiss on your first date, even if you've been in an LDR with them for 7 months, the intensity of your feelings for them will likely not be reciprocated at the same level, not because they don't want to, but because they simply can't. (Although I think that's not just an ASD thing, it would probably be difficult to find anyone who doesn't have BPD whose emotions are as intense as ours). They will need time alone, likely a lot of time, possibly more time than you can give them without getting a mental breakdown. However, I love my boyfriend, and I know he loves me too, the fact that he still wants me in his life after all I've done to him is more than enough to convince me of that. And ultimately, I am ill, and it's my responsibility to seek help and get better, not his. He has a neurodevelopmental disorder that he cannot ""cure"", his brain is just wired differently, it's who he is and although he can make adjustments (and he has, he's tried very hard to respond to my needs as best he can), he can't 'get rid' of his Autism. I, on the other hand, have a mental illness that I can get rid of with the right support and medication, and I'm the cause of most of the problems in our relationship. The onus is on me to change, not him."

I try to balance the two factors, but often I go too far one way, and then upset both of us. Generally speaking, if he doesn't reply to me, I try to gently remind him a few hours later, or perhaps a day later. Thankfully I've never had to wait more than a day for a reply.

Not all people are gaslighters, as difficult as it is for us to accept, some people cannot answer messages in a timely manner for genuine reasons, not because they hate you, or want to get rid of you. On the other hand, some people are just twats.

Let's be honest, the voting records of most, if not all Tory MPs will not be acceptable to the membership and many of our voters. On the other hand, getting some Tory MPs to defect will definitely be a boon and be seen a political victory. If they show humility and 'repent' so to say, they could be a great asset to our party"

LibDem,etu34cy,t1_ettrghb,1563203068.0,">It's clear here that she's referring to ethnic nationalism (the ""OG"" nationalism) - not the civic nationalism that came later.

Wrong again. Modern nationalism began primarily as a movement for popular sovereignty among the oppressed minorities of Europe in the 19th century. It was largely a civic movement led by the liberal, middle-class intelligentsia which hoped to liberate national minorities from the rule of Europe's tyrannical multi-national empires. It was later co-opted by the conservative elites of crumbling empires like Germany and turned into a reactionary force which helped maintain those old elites in power under the guise of national strength and interests. Nationalism was subsequently ethnicised and racialised across Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The history of British nationalism is slightly different due to our unique historical circumstances (a national identity which has existed for much longer than in most of Europe as well as the ubiquity of Empire in public discourse which made nationalism and British imperialism synonymous), nevertheless, it  followed the same trends as in Europe. The racialised, genocidal nationalism we associate with the word today is largely a 20th century phenomenon. Of course that still means nationalism has been ethnic and xenophobic for almost half of its existence, but ethnic nationalism of the type we see today is not ""OG"" nationalism.

Edit: And I am generalising here. There are many countries, such as some of former states of the USSR where nationalism is generally perceived to be a progressive force, and is not necessarily mutually exclusive with internationalism. At least not yet anyway."

It mostly manifests itself through indifference (for example, not being vocally opposed to things like the clearly illiberal elements of the Communications Act 2003) but I have personally a noticed hostility towards the notion of free speech from many members of the party.

LibDem,esyt1wb,t1_esys1nj,1562349005.0,"I disagree, except in the case of children. No adult is forced to eat sugary shit, nor serve it to their kids. It is primarily a failure of education. It is possible and fairly easy to eat healthily on a very low budget, but people just aren't taught to. And personal responsibility does come into it, there are many people who know how to eat healthily and have both the time and money to do it, they just can't be arsed (I used to be one of them lol). 

The only circumstance where that isn't the case are food deserts, but those aren't really a thing in the UK. Every local supermarket carries a plethora of healthy food. Frankly, when it comes to obesity in particular, rather than nutrition in general, the issue isn't necessarily even about eating unhealthy food, it's about eating too much food altogether. Counting calories isn't really that hard."

Nevertheless, I wish our party took political and economic rights and freedoms as seriously as it does social rights.

The Party's stance on political and personal rights like free speech, or economic freedoms such as the right to private property often proves to be entirely illiberal. Just like the political scene as a whole, our party has been infected by a sort of moral authoritarianism which assumes it is right to impose one's moral judgments onto others in the name of the greater good. It is not the role of the state to police its citizens' thoughts, nor indeed their words."

I am not OP, but for me the nation state is of no particular value whatsoever, and I am indifferent to the possibility of nation states withering away. I am a Eurofederalist partly because a United Europe is one of the first steps towards the very long term goal of a borderless world where people are free to move and live wherever they want, where conflict over national or religious divisions is non existent. Towards global harmony and unity. It is a lofty aspiration I know, but the EU is the first of the very many steps we have to take to eventually achieve this vision."
