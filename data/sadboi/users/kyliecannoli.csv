Again, you still haven’t explained to me if Chinese could only be used as a nationality, what does it mean to be Chinese American then? Why is Chinese under ethnicity in all the government surveys? 

You’re right. I gotta stop feeding trolls, one like yourself. So it doesn’t matter to you that perpetuating the sickly yellow Chinese stereotype with Chinese virus hurts your fellow Americans? 

Of course I’m playing the victims card cuz it’s the only one I’m dealt with. I AM a victim in this. The perpetuation of sickly Chinese definitely makes me a victim I have ZERO doubt. 

I love how when you hurt someone and that person tells u that they’re hurt, you accuse them of having victim complex. That’s some fucked up twisted logic you have right there. 

I never hid the fact that I wanted to turn this horrendous thing into something that benefits me. It drove traffic to my insta and comics so yeah, I am foshoooo using it for my gains because it directly affects me negatively out of my control, and I’m taking my control back.

You victim blaming abuser."
angrycatpics,fl7w05o,t1_fl7ut5g,1584910573.0,"Again, if Chinese can only be a nationality, what does it mean to be a Chinese American then? Someone with dual citizenship? I and tens of thousands of other Chinese Americans like me only have one. No such thing as ethnically Chinese LOL look at every throughout survey run by the US government, when they ask for your race, a lot of times under asian, they ask you to specify Japanese Chinese Vietnamese or Korean. PLEASE Wikipedia the word Chinese. It literally says it also refers to the ethnicity of Chinese. Yes nationality too, BUT ALSO ETHNICITY. C’mon dude, come at me with facts. 

And many millions of ethnically Chinese folks around the world ain’t doing that!!! We’re saying when people say “Chinese  virus” a lot of them just group Chinese people outside of China with the ones there!!! And WEEEEEEEE YOUR FELLOW AMERICAN are telling you that’s not right!!! WEEEEEEEE YOUR FELLOW AMERICAN are telling you to STOP using that word to lump as with mainland!!!!!!!! Omg you’re soooooo fucking dumb lollllll goddamnit 

If anyone can reap karma from this, you better fucking bet it’s a Chinese American like myself. It hurts my feelings and millions other like me, and I’m fucking using it for my gain. If anyone can turn a negative into something  positive for themselves, even karma, you fucking bet it’s only a Chinese person. ETHNICALLY. Goddamn lol you THIC skull."

Nobody denouncing the term “Chinese virus” is saying do not talk shit about ccp!!! We’re saying, do NOT mix all ethnically Chinese people born n raised around the world who have never ever been to China with the Chinese people or the CCP in China!!!! Omg get it thru your thick skull!! Lolllllll"
angrycatpics,fl6f50p,t1_fl6d0xj,1584866024.0,"Ughhhhhh you literally have the definition of nationality right there!!! It means they BELONG TO A PARTICULAR NATION!! Tell me what nation does a Chinese American belong to?? America or China?? A Chinese American belongs to the nation of AMERICA but ETHNICALLY Chinese! And us Chinese Americans did not do shit to create that virus!!!

Blah blah to save myself from repeating the shit I agree with you on!! Cmon dude, don’t tell me I wasted my time debating with a dummie bruh!

You’re right, all Chinese people are bad, including the ones born n raised outside China their whole fucking life who’s never stepped foot in China. We Chinese Americans born and raised in America here helped created the Chinese virus... i guess telepathically...? Cuz physically we ain’t there lol but anyways IM GUILTY 🙋🏻‍♀️"
angrycatpics,fl6avv8,t1_fl68gsh,1584860790.0,"Nooooope. It’s not JUST a nationality. It could be, but not limited to. It’s definitely also an ethnicity. People born and raised outside of China do not belong to China. Please google the definition of “nationality” before you speak further on this subject bruh lol 

Again.... you’re back to talking about the CCP again. Millions and millions of people with Chinese ethnicity born and raised outside of China are NOT from neither do they belong to China. That’s why grouping everyone around the world and shove them into this tight corner is wrong and ignorant. 

Blah blah blah yeah BIG agree on ccp bad bad bad. Again, Chinese can be referring to the whole ethnicity, and every single one of us living outside of China has Jack shit to do with anything coming from there. So STOP GROUPING US WITH THEM."
angrycatpics,fl67ytu,t1_fl66n78,1584857559.0,"Chinese people being called yellow and sickly traces back to the opium war era. The term “Chinese virus”, especially in western world, further perpetuates that degrading & discriminatory stereotype and slander. Chinese people are NOT the CCP. It’s a race, we’re everywhere in the world, not a small group of people in power. As a Chinese American, wtf did I do to contribute to “creating” that Chinese virus??  What about Chinese people in France? Singapore? Brazil?"
