depression,fpmuypp,t3_g803bs,1588742438.0,"Hope therapy is helping you, I know it's hard when we lose someone that we have grown to love so deeply and have known for a long time ,we often imagine the what ifs and question what we did wrong but both questions are  self destructive the more we ask ourselves the more we become frustrated.
And we began to lose hope in love, breakups usually are outside of our control most of the time sometimes they just change mindsets for example a couple that were party animals in their 15ths may or may not stay together in their 20s. 
     But what is in our control is how we react, a lover is similar to being addicted to something it releases feel good hormones , changing routines might help trying something new?
We cannot just burry our feelings underground it's okay to cry and  .
I believe it's best to remove ourselves from the picture because no one can make us happy but ourselves.
One of my friends is feeling the same way and I tell her that there are many guys that would like to be with her and when time passes and she meets someone else she will doubt ever being inloved before. 
I hope you began to believe in love again remember to be patient and kind with yourself."

Like his the smart one and she's the pretty one but in reality no one is the smartest you can be good at a subject , and beauty is defined by you, olive green  is not uglier than pink it's just that some people like warmer and bright colors.
      Iam sure their is something you enjoy doing , hobbies can help you build confidence and attract people with a similar Aesthetic.there is no such thing as not having a personality unless your a Kardashian.
Iam sure their is something your greatful for. Like being able to breath, let's embrace grief and pain because it's part of life, pain is also temporal.
