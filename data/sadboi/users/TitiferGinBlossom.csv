The booze potentiates the loraz so you may OD to death. But it depends on dosage, metabolism, etc as to how your body reacts to the whole shebang. It could fail as an attempt to kill yourself and youâ€™d be very very sick and feel like unutterable shit for days afterwards. Trust me, the pain of that ainâ€™t worth it. If youâ€™re looking for a way out thatâ€™s painless, itâ€™s probs best not to try this little cocktail. If you are feeling suicidal, first of all, donâ€™t act on it right now; go away and distract yourself, be around other people, or call a helpline or your Psych/Therapist. If you canâ€™t do any of that, get rid of all the drugs right now. Just flush them without thinking about it. Go take a fucking freezing cold shower, dry off, wrap up warm in bed, and try to get some sleep. Then call your Dr in the morning."

ETA: To all the down voters; I and many others in my experience who have various diagnoses which leave us off the beaten path have abilities not granted to the neurologically otherwise unimpaired. The manic side of my bipolar disorder can allow me to be so much more prolific, capable, and indefatigable than when Iâ€™m not in that state. This is super powerful. Iâ€™ve achieved things I wouldnâ€™t have otherwise. Iâ€™ve made positive changes in my realm of human contact for others that I couldnâ€™t have without the extra focus and energy that mania brings. It allows me to fuck the detractorsâ€™ opinions right off and do stuff wholly uninhibited that other people canâ€™t or wonâ€™t do. So yes, it can be a super power. It can imbue one with abilities beyond the norm."

I spent forty odd years desperately trying to appease and please. The last couple of years have been a lot better in that I have a lot of that shit up and focussed on myself a tad more.
