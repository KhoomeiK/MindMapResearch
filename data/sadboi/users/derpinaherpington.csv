bigdickproblems,fgdl6y1,t3_exq4w3,1580683665.0,"Good dick criteria:

- has and can maintain good rhythm
- yummy cum (stays hydrated, eats citrus, no steak)
- good hygiene (no bad smells or smegma)
- good stamina (no one pump chumps or minute man)
- no refractory period 
- gets hard immediately
- gets fully hard, not just semi
- an upward curve can hit the g spot
- sensitive enough to cum from ""normal"" sex (I've been with guys who couldn't cum unless in tight tight grip)

The thing is no dick has all the things on the list, those are just some things that have made a dick a good dick for me.

Size isn't really a factor because I've been with smaller guys and in that case, just has to be hygenic and receptive to BJ's and hands. 

I've also been with huge dicks that had zero rhythm, didn't achieve max hardness, and had refractory periods of an hour+

I stupidly asked why he blocked me. He said ""I don't know, I can't remember, I think it's because I felt I was going to relapse and I did"" so that explains his friends beating him up.
