CleanEating,fpui5a3,t1_fpueqlo,1588913508.0,Wtf type of reply is this to a legitimate answer to your question?
Toyota,folpyz1,t3_g7xpnb,1587867746.0,I loved my 2008 FJ. I only traded it in for a 2018 tundra which I also love. I had my fj the same time my buddy had a jeep. The FJ was so much better quality and reliability. It was the most unique vehicle I think I'll ever own and I wish I didn't have to sell it. The back seat is not the easiest to get into due to the half suicide door but that was my passengers problem not mine :p.

ToyotaTundra,fhx3v1y,t3_f55sq0,1581943629.0,I would also like to know lol
SkincareAddiction,fgikti9,t1_fggoq3b,1580824528.0,Definitely this. Try the extra strong selsun blue. It actually has instructions for the treatment of tinea Versicolor on the bottle.
Paleo,fcnau7t,t1_fcmwo0n,1577807629.0,Drinking a Gatorade with sugar would break a fast. Electrolytes themselves have no calories and are not burned for fuel. They assist in the functioning of cells instead.
Paleo,fcnap2x,t3_ehzyno,1577807531.0,I think you do not need electrolytes unless you are worried about dehydration. If you are exerting yourself during the fast and sweating alot then you might want to replace your electrolytes. Aside from that I wouldn't think so as long as you are eating the right nutrition during your non fast. You won't break your fast if you get your electrolytes from a none calorie source. Ie don't drink Gatorade. Doesn't count as Paleo but Mio sport has electrolytes and no calories.
ThunderBay,fclva88,t3_ehvpoz,1577757323.0,This is considered heavy but not uncommon. There is a good chance we will get more. The amount of snow we had prior to this storm was not as much as normal.
ptsd,fc1vbyp,t1_fc1ppzx,1577330859.0,I've had this same message
ptsd,fbxm8je,t3_eexnfm,1577193647.0,Ptsd is not an excuse for this behaviour. There are hundreds of us on this forum who have ptsd and don't torture our partners. I don't often comment on others relationships but in this case I feel it's necessary. LEAVE. This is abuse and possibly a crime. Be prepared for him to get worse when you do. I can't give any advice about getting protective orders etc. But depending on where you live there are services that can help you. Google victim services in your area
ptsd,fbwqpzz,t1_fbwgubp,1577156919.0,I see this as a possibility. I've been trying my best to fight the urge to isolate myself. It just makes things so much easier. A lot of my friends are co-workers and I haven't told many of them yet. I have told my closest friends though and everyone has obviously been supportive. Work is the last thing I want to be talking about right now and for most of them it's all they talk about together.

ptsd,fbidj1m,t3_edcjv7,1576897896.0,"I have found success listening to guided body scan meditation on Spotify. 

Other things tips that have helped me

To start I focus not just on breathing but the way the breath feels entering my airway and filling my lungs. If I find my mind drifting I'll using this to ground myself. 

Look up mindfulness or mindful meditation. When a thought drifts into my head I label the thought (ex a fear or something I can't control) and focus back in breathing."
ptsd,faoiv42,t3_ea75dq,1576265339.0,"My wife is the one who convinced me to get help. I had symptoms for a while but took a severe down turn after a work injury. It took a huge toll on our relationship. We are in a good place now but I was afraid I was going to loose her at one point. She admitted to me that it had crossed her mind. She is super supportive and always have been but eventually it was enough. She wishes she spoke up sooner. I wished I realized myself what was happening before I hurt her. 

She told me
""If we are going to get better you need to talk to someone and get help. Something is wrong and I am not the one who is going to be able to fix it"" 

Something that might be stopping him from getting help is thinking it's not that bad. That what he experienced wasn't bad enough to earn ptsd. I can tell you that almost everyone (especially men) who get diagnosed with ptsd think this at some point.

Everyone's trauma is their own. It's not the trauma but how it was processed or not processed in most situations. Also it's not always one event. A quote a once heard ""trauma starts in the third trimester""."
ptsd,fakik81,t3_e9hkje,1576167736.0,I am a first responder off work with ptsd. I would also love something like this. It's not that I think first responders are anymore more deserving or special then anyone else with ptsd. It's just easier to relate to others with similar trauma. There are some peer support groups around for this. Unfortunately not in my part of the country.

internetparents,fa1o2y8,t1_fa1ak3c,1575772278.0,Definitely this. In Canada you will have protection as well but you will need evidence. A doctor's note to start. Obviously trouble sleeping is a very common sickness to ptsd so it's like your case is unique. If you are in a unionized possession start by contacting your rep. This obviously would only be an issue if they fire you. Considering you already informed your manager about a disability it would be asking for trouble for them to fire you. I assume you would have a case for a labour lawyer to look at.
Toyota,f8gj8b6,t3_e0r248,1574560526.0,I have no experience with this but maybe try disconnecting one of the poles on your cars battery for a couple seconds. This might reset everything in the car including the screen.
ptsd,f8g561b,t3_e0q2p1,1574554254.0,I don't use the word trigger to describe it for this reason. I either say Im out if my window of tolerance or I say I was activated.
ptsd,f3zezzd,t3_dfxido,1571268047.0,"Thank you! I always doubt if I ""earned"" my PTSD diagnosis. I'm a first responder and I was diagnosed after working for 8 years. I've had shit calls but  I never had the type of call where I thought it would end my career. I meet other first responders who worked for like 20+ years before being diagnosed and I'm ashamed to tell them. 

This is also why there is a stigma still behind mental health. ""How did you get ptsd? You haven't had that bad of calls. You haven't worked that long""

A great line I heard once was ""trauma starts in the third trimester."" I had trauma growing up as well. A lot of people choose to serve or choose a helping career because they want to help people the way they wished they were helped.

Also I personally dislike when people thank me for my ""service"". I got to do a job I loved, got paid to do it and got to help people. That's all the thanks I need. And now I'm lucky enough to be taken care of by workplace insurance. I couldn't imagine having to struggle with the symptoms while struggling to access or afford help."
