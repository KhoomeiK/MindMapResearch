WomensHealth,fo0alvw,t1_fnxdqmf,1587409147.0,"Mine is due to inflammation that I have in my vulva, that was brought on by treating a long term yeast infection, and then the skin right around the clit constantly rubbing together, because of the placement. Sort of like a urticaria thing. Maybe try not using the cloth for a while and use some sort of healing barrier creme or coconit oil and lay off the soap till its healed. Also avoid using underwear or at least use cotton. Think of it as a irritated area as anywhere else on the skin, keep it clean, give it air and rest and it will heal sooner. Skin in that area usually heals pretty quickly, but the fact that there is constant rubbing and heat can be irritating, so the goal is to eliminate that."
WomensHealth,fnxclvg,t3_g4fk3o,1587335925.0,"I have the same kind of sensitive clit. Recently I have had some inflammation and I will spare you the long story - but, I know how you are feeling. I think you must have had some sort of injury to the skin around the clitoris. It could be an allergic reaction, it could be from masturbating, etc. Have you done anything that could upset the area that also seems white? Also, don't remove the white stuff, it's probably a film of skin, because the skin around your clitoris is healing. There are a lot of nerve endings right in that area, so if the skin is just a bit ""raw"" it can really hurt. 

I reccomend you get the Avené cicalfate repair cream and some coconut oil. This is my life saver. The Avené cream is expensive, but it's very healing, works as a barrier and safe to use on your labia. It's a very dry cream, so I mix it with coconut oil just on my hand, so it's easier to apply. If you don't want to go and spend all that money just use coconut oil, also safe to use on your labia. Or some zink salvie, the stuff you also use for babies, unparfumed ofc. And then keep the area clean, but don't use any soaps.

With a really heavy flow it's possible to spill, but it's so much more manageable than with a tampon. You insert it and you can just forget about it for most of the day.

But, it does increase my cramps tbh. I have a very tight pelvic floor, overall tightness and yeah... It does take some practise inserting and removing it also. The first couple of times I thought it was really stuck in there, so I reccomend using some lube or coconut oil for both inserting and removing it, while also learning some good techniques from YouTube.

I was eventually told by an obgyn, that the body produces these certain pain hormones when you are on your period, and some women just produce more than others. Other than that I have always dealt with a tight pelvic floor, leading to pain during ovulation and terrible cramps, sometimes painful penetration. I can't say much about why you have such bad cramps, but maybe you are like me. Also, search for vaginismus. It's a condition that can make penetration, even by fingers or tampons, almost impossible, because the muscles get too tense. Like others have said, you can buy dialaters to help with this. I can also recommend doing yoga and stretches to release the pelvic floor muscles, because if they are tight, it might be contributing to things. I have no idea if any of this is useful, but I really hope it is!

Have you ever been prescribed certain painkillers for your cramps? Lately my pelvic floor has been even tighter, making my cramps unbearable, I was prescribed Tremadol and Ibumetin and it helps."

Healthyhooha,fnghzhd,t3_g1imne,1586932836.0,"Both mycoplasma and ureaplasma are real. The reason your gyno might say that, is because most people carry the ureaplasma bacteria naturally without it causing harm. Because of that it is often found in tests of healthy people as well. But you can still become infected with ureaplasma through sexual contact and sometimes through a sneeze or cough causing respiratory symptoms. Btw I'm not a doctor, this is just the knowledge I have gathered when researching my own problems. If you have yellow discharge, that you don't normally have, that is an indicator of something being off, either std or yeast infection. If it's not chunky and you don't itch like crazy, it's probably not yeast though. 

You have a right to get tested. Can you go to a clinic or see another gynecologist? You can also order these tests online to test yourself at home, so if maybe look into that! Maybe you don't have ureaplasma, but it will still be nice for you to rule out.

AmItheAsshole,fneql9k,t3_g16iac,1586894087.0,"NTA. Former camgirl here. I had clients who I genuinely cared about and the amount of money they payed me didn't mean much to me. Specifically one client I had good chemistry with. He was a bit insecure and a bit lonely, but very intelligent and I would honestly become sad when our session was over. Outside of sessions it was purely platonic and we genuinely cared if the other had a good or bad day.

Being a camgirl it's actually so relieving to have those clients, who are not just about getting you to do nasty things for their pleasure and being creepy with you, and there are a lot of those! I honestly think she appreciates you as a nice customer and there is nothing creepy in what you are doing, despite of what your friends might think.

People have all sorts of prejudices when it comes to the cam world. Both about models and customers. Buts it's so much more nuanced than that. You are not doing anything wrong, if you enjoy talking to this girl and watching her on cam, go for it. What matters is that you enjoy it, your friends just don't understand it.

However, it shouldn't get in the way of actual dating, if you are looking to bond with someone that could lead to somewhere. Of course talking to a camgirl is nice, but it can't go further, which you of course know."

I'm not a doctor, but it seems there is something going on which you should bring up with your doctor or obgyn. I would take some painkillers to bring down fever and possible muscle tensions or I flammation. Drink lots of water to hopefully make urination less painful. Those are my only tips really. Perhaps the cyst could be causing some fever? 

I had expected endometriosis as well, but I turned out to be fine. I did however once experience a cyst pop I side of me, I think maybe it was in my ovaries. I had acute crazy pain, like I never felt before. I felt like I was gonna throw up, I had a high fever and couldn't even sit up right. It was during my period and followed by days of the worst cramps I have ever experienced. It passed on its own, doctors just told me to take painkillers. I have no idea of that's useful to you.

I'm used to my ovulation discharge and I thought the pain would get less, because maybe it ""neutralized"" my acidic discharge. Now that just sounds like crazy talk to me. What you are saying about the hormones makes sense. It's confusing how these symptoms seem to be so similar to cytolytic vaginosis, which also gets better during period and worse before period. I'm still confused what my problem might be. 

Thank you, I will leave the gel in my drawer and just stick to coconut oil. I have prescription ibuprofin, so I will take that as well. I will also ask the dermatologist about a healthier ointment, like you say. 

Thank you so much for sharing your story with me. I'm sorry it took you so long to find answers, but I'm happy you finally found the right person, who knew what your answer was. Erotic novels seems like a shitty advice, like that would fix everything, ugh. From what I gather, you had hormonal imbalances and later you developed yeast or bv, which was overtreated and led to vestibulis. Was then when you had the extreme irritation? I feel like my symptoms all came at once after all this yeast treatment, I never had hormonal issues, which I actually got checked out in the past due to other symptoms. I feel like a lot of what you are describing matches my symptoms, but on the other hand it seems like you had a long history before this and that's where I feel like I dont match with you. Did you bring down the inflammation on your own using the antihestamins and ibuprofen or were they prescribed to you by your doctor?

I'm glad to hear you are a vaginal health educator and advocate. I read your article and I will keep it in my backhand to even possibly help explain things to my doctor. 

Also thank you for giving me so much hope that this can become better. I'm happy to hear that you are able to have a completely normal life, being able to move freely with a little help from meds. I am hoping that by following your advice I can get this under control as well."

I'm seeing a dermatologist who is also specialized in stds this Wednesday. Do you think this is something I can bring up to him?

I was convinced my acidic discharge was the problem, as the discharge started happening before the inflammation, which is why I have been suspecting cytolytic vaginosis. But it makes sense, just like a runny nose with allergies. I never thought about that. I get relief with my period and also when I'm ovulating and I get that weird gooey discharge (sorry if that's tmi). The hormonal changes you describe I have never thought about either, so thank you for making me aware of that!! 

The steroid cream I mentioned, I just took a look at. It's actually a fluocinolon gel and it says it's for anti-inflammatory purposes and to relieve eczema. I know you are not a doctor, but I'm wondering if I should try applying it, as I am experiencing a bad flare up today, but I don't want to make things worse either.

What I understand from what you are writing, you take the antihestamins together with ibuprofen daily? I tried the antihestamins for about a week back then, but I gave up, as I didn't feel any effect. Maybe it just wasn't enough using it on its own?

How did all this start for you? As I have described, my issues started after using the antifungal meds for weeks, but I don't know if that could be the cause for something like this? Although, I do know it can cause vulvodynia and that is a diagnosis I have accepted by now. pelvic You say you have been dealing with this since 20 years old, which of course makes me a bit worried about this being something permant, so I'm really curious about your story and what has helped you. As in how where you diagnosed and do you always have the liquid discharge? Is raw skin normal with inflammation? Did you have inflammation for a while, and not just use the creams for vulvodynia/vestibulis? Right now I'm a bit discouraged and confused, I'm 22 and I imagine never having sex or doing sports again, so looking for any advice to follow."

I think that you being male it won't hurt taking it for two weeks, if your doctor is sure that it's a yeast infection. Have you ruled out other things like allergies though?

I stopped using it because it made the stinging worse, but I am open to trying it again, now that you say it's normal to sting more in the beginning. I have also been keeping the area moistrised with coconut oil or organic natural YES OB oil based lube.

What is just so confusing to me, is that on the days that I don't have discharge, there is a lot less irritation. I can move around and have an almost normal day, even exercise. Even one day into having my period, I can wear panties and walk normally again. And my discharge has never looked like this before. Did you ever experience anything like that? 

Hearing that our stories are similar makes me feel more comftable, like there is actually and end to all this. I just need to find an answer. I'm not on any medications lately, I'm honestly willing to try the antihestimans and steroid cream again, if it's safe."
Healthyhooha,fna699e,t1_fna2q3h,1586791819.0,"I'm sorry you are going through this too, it really is hell!! In the week before my period, the stingong is so bad all I can do is cry. My skin feels so raw and it has led to vulvodynia. I brought it up to my obgyn, but he says lactobacillus overgrowth is impossible, yet he couldn't describe my symptoms with anything else. I'm so discouraged with no doctors being able to give me some advice. Please let me know, if you figure out anything!! I can recommend the baking soda sith baths, they really help with the skin irritation."
WomensHealth,fna005a,t1_fn9z57k,1586788338.0,Thank you! I have never thought about this. Maybe you are right. How can I bring my inflammation down? Is it really posible to have that in the entire body?
sex,fn96bvt,t3_g04od5,1586760955.0,"I used to think that the more experience, the more fun. Being with one partner for the rest of my life seemed really boring to me and I was scared I would feel tied down. I don't know if it's because I have already been a hoe, I did camwork and well yeah gained some experience, but I have never been more sure that my boyfriend is all I need and will ever need. Having good sex with someone you trust and love is worth a lot more that one night stands. My boyfriend and I broke up for a period of time and we both slept with other people, it very disappointing tbh. The better you know someone, the better the sex, if you ask me. I have had my kinkiest experiences in my loving relationship, compared to flings and one night stands."

WomensHealth,fn6a3yy,t1_fn64nwv,1586693163.0,"Thank you. I have heard about pelvic floor dysfuntion and thought about it, but im very unsure about it. I feel like my problem is very acute. But I am certain that the stress from the assault and the stress from going through all this is making the pain a lot worse, as I am very tense. The pain and irritation didnt start after the accident, I only got a yeast infection back then, which cleared up quickly. I started experiencing my current symptoms after I stopped all the meds in january and then a month went by - bam I woke up one day after my period and the pain was unreal. Since then it has been up and down. I have never had BV or UTI. 

When it comes to candida - I think I have the opposite problem. My doctor confirmed that I dont have trush from looking at my tongue and all the meds would have cleared that up by now, if I did have thrush, she says. I dont have skin rashes either, like under my boobs or in my armpits like you do with candida overgrowth. Instead my skin is just very sensitive and starts bleeding very easily. This all started when I was months into taking antifungals and not before. This is why I think it might be due to the meds. Flucanazole/Diflucan (which is what I have been on for a long time) has side effects like increased chances of bleeding because of loss of platelets amond other things. I havent taken them for a long time, but I'm wondering if taking them for so long could have effected my body long term? Or does that seem irrational? Another medication I have taken is itriconazole and I just read that a side effect from those could be an unpleasant taste in your mouth. I havent taken those in a long time either, but I think I was on them for like 6 weeks back then. 

I have been douching as well, But I'm scared of doing something that will make this all worse. I do feel like the douching has helped actually, but I'm scared its jsut placebo and I'm making this a lot worse. 

But as for the tight pelvic floor, I will look into some PT like you suggest. Maybe I can find some excersises online, cause I cant see a physical therapist due to covid, which is fair. 

Thank you very much for reaching out and gving me some advice, I appriciate it."
WomensHealth,fn68ukn,t1_fn62mpk,1586691885.0,Thank you. I am using coconut oil and it helps. I have been taking d vitamins for my immune system but I will look into the c vitamin as well. How can magnesium help me relax my pelvic floor?
WomensHealth,fmzjxt9,t3_fy50il,1586522656.0,"Yes stress weakens your immune system. I experience the same, but illness makes you stressed as well so it's a hard spiral to break out of. Best you can do is to take as much care of yourself mentally and physically as possible and destress. Often the body knows when to ""stick it out"" like during a time where you need to be on your toes and alert and then as soon as you have time to take a breath, you become sick."

She did not respect your boundries and you have every right to be upset about that. Personally, I would cut that person off completely, but that's up to you of course. It's normal to feel doubt and many different feelings after an experience like this. Make sure you reach out to someone in your life who you can talk about this with. I experienced an assault as well and I kept downplaying it and I kept pushing my feelings aside, but it only made then grow bigger over time."
WomensHealth,fmo6kco,t3_fweovk,1586247250.0,"If you are not itching, it is probably hormonal. We live with various bacteria and yeast in our bodies and they are supposed to be there. Only when they come out of balance, we experience stuff like a yeast infection from candida overgrowth. Some women have a yeast infection every month the week before their period, because of changes in the natural flora down there. Ask your doctor about your birth control to see if that might be the problem. If you are itching and red down there, might be a yeast infection."

infj,fmkragt,t3_fvulsa,1586165546.0,"As another commenter said, I can't speak for her but only put myself in her shoes.

As an INFJ woman, this kind of behavior would mean that I am not interested. I'm sorry, it's probably not what you want to hear.

If I like someone, I put a lot of energy into exploring what it might become - friendship or more. I spend a lot of time getting to know them and understand why they are they way they are. If she doesn't show interest on how you are doing, that's a red flag. The fact that she is very closed about herself is also a clear sign. It seems she is trying to keep you at a distance. Unfortunately I think INFJs can be bad at just saying it how it is - ""I'm not into you"", because we don't want to upset the person. 

Also moving on from a breakup takes a long time for me. I rarely find a very deep connection and when I lose one, I need a lot of healing time to move on from that.

If I were you, say it how it is. If she says the feelings aren't mutual, you can move on and find piece of mind."

WomensHealth,fmhj84d,t3_fv3wot,1586082420.0,"The thought about the experience is a lot worse than how it actually is. I used to have crippling anxiety about going in for a checkup, but now it's routine for me. They are going to take good care of you in there. Tell your doctor first thing that this is your first time and you are nervous. Ask them to talk you through it, although they probably will either way. That's always my experience.

If you feel more comftable going to a female doctor, do that. I have seen both men and women, but I have the best experience with male doctors. I think they are more careful, because they don't actually know what it feels like. No matter what, the doctor will be very careful. They tell you ""I'm just going to do this now, now I'm going to touch you here, just relax, I'm doing this now"". And then it's over quicker than you would have thought.

No one ever told me this, but you are entitled to ask for the smallest speculum. I always ask them to use the smallest. They also use lube and gloves to make it more comftable. Make sure you relax and take deep breaths. It might sound weird, but try and make your bottom ""heavy"", just completely let go of all tention when you are lying there and sink your tailbone into the foundation beneath you (idk the eblgish word for those madresses thingies). It might seem hard when you are nervous, but tensing up can make you feel a bit uncomftable.

Ask your friend to go with you. Just knowing she is in the waiting room outside might make you more relaxed and less nervous.

When it's over you will be surprised how easy and quick it was. Remember that these doctors have seen it all before. They have heard all your questions before. There is nothing embarrassing about it. If you want to mention the assault you can, but it is completely up to you. If you think it might help explain why you are tense about the situation, you can mention it.

Good luck."

Thank you and sorry if I seem discouraged."
Healthyhooha,fme4hr7,t3_fuhsh0,1585988981.0,"I have something similar but no smelling discharge. My discharge is white and very thin like milk. I made a post about it recently. I also have burning and stinging nerve pain and skin irritation. I suspect I have cytolytic vaginosis after being tested negative for everything else. Continue treating for mycoplasma, but if it doesn't work try looking into cytolytic vaginosis.

My cramps have also been much much worse lately. I think it's because I tense up in my muscles down there because of my pain in my vulva. I was prescribed tramadol and other painkillers and the only thing that worked for me.

I am active in many vulvodynia support groups and many of these women have cytolytic vaginosis, but very few doctors believe it's a thing.

When it's hard, let it be hard. Do it for 15 minutes and let it be that. Another day you will do 30 minutes. That's OK. Once you get over that hurdle and you start seeing changes, it gets easier."
