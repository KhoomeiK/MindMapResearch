politics,fnl94oy,t1_fnl92kt,1587049347.0,Exactly.
BPD,fnhput4,t1_fnhpjyh,1586966769.0,"Yeah, I don’t know what I’d do in that situation. I find non-violent communication (Rosenberg, he’s got some books on it) has been extremely helpful to me in conflicts with people. Other than reading some of that if you’re up for it, I don’t really know what to say."
BPD,fnhob2o,t3_g1uiee,1586965996.0,"IMO it might be evidence of the change in you that she’s able to open up and be really really upset about that stuff now. She’s perhaps trying to see if she can trust you with her feelings now that things have improved. If this makes sense or feels right, try just validating her and not worrying about defending yourself. If your therapist says It’s not manipulative, Just know in yourself it’s not and validate your gf anyway. 
Best of luck regardless."
ontario,fn9yt6a,t3_fw9079,1586787630.0,Does anyone know where to find out if your case is still being seen in family court? I’m in Waterloo region.

AmItheAsshole,fmbwvfj,t1_fmbwtx3,1585934698.0,Yep.
AmItheAsshole,fmbwlfs,t1_fmbvsqy,1585934555.0,"These talks don’t usually get anywhere, which is another piece of the problem. He often says stuff like, “it’s not like that,” but never says what it IS like. So what am I supposed to think?! lol"
AmItheAsshole,fmbwa47,t1_fmbvq0u,1585934391.0,"I definitely don’t feel like a priority. 

I wish I believed I could do better, but that’s not a problem for this sub!"
AmItheAsshole,fmbvfy8,t1_fmbt9hr,1585933947.0,"All I know is that the friend’s name is what he says it is if he gets a text from them. (I haven’t been snooping, I’ve seen a preview on his lock screen)"
AmItheAsshole,fmbtukr,t1_fmbtker,1585933100.0,"I agree. The worst part overall is that when I see him I get my hopes up so high that my needs will be met, and often ruin a decent hang out with a breakdown cuz I’m so disappointed and preoccupied with how lonely and distanced I feel. It really is a agony, with or without meeting his friend."
AmItheAsshole,fmbsz68,t1_fmbsquk,1585932647.0,Definitely.
AmItheAsshole,fmbswes,t1_fmbsblw,1585932608.0,"Yeah, my most recent x said things like, “I just like to keep my work and social life separate,” and shit like that (even though I knew all his friends and went to work events with him), as the excuse for why he was “single” on fb. In reality, he was still trying to get one particular person to be with him and didn’t want to discourage her from being with him. 

I just get a bit baffled by how deceitful people can be. I want to assume people will be kind and honest. I don’t know why I keep thinking that..."
AmItheAsshole,fmbsez3,t1_fmbrft9,1585932358.0,"You’re right. If he would just be clear and honest about why, it wouldn’t be as much of an issue."
AmItheAsshole,fmbs5ni,t1_fmbrcue,1585932220.0,"Yeah, I definitely don’t want to be with them all the time. I feel like I’d be beating a dead horse at this point, trying to get him to talk about it. Maybe I’m wrong."
AmItheAsshole,fmbrx8e,t1_fmbr6v3,1585932097.0,"Like, once a week maybe? I don’t hear about it every time. I know they text a bit."
AmItheAsshole,fmbrtlh,t1_fmbr1sg,1585932044.0,"That’s wonderful that he’s been so supportive. I’m feeling pretty hopeless. I just want to feel loved, in the end."
AmItheAsshole,fmbno5v,t1_fmbnezg,1585929868.0,Yeah...
AmItheAsshole,fmbn06c,t1_fmbmjnm,1585929516.0,"Do you think him saying “I’m not hiding anything from you,” when I didn’t accuse him of hiding anything, is a clue? People give themselves away sometimes."
AmItheAsshole,fmbmu2u,t1_fmbm7n4,1585929429.0,I am definitely considering it.
AmItheAsshole,fmbmq53,t1_fmbm7ga,1585929372.0,"Omg, I did not remember this existed. Amazing, thank you!"
AmItheAsshole,fmbhxxz,t1_fmbhivk,1585926717.0,"Jesus, thank you for sharing that, that’s terrible. 

I guess it’s not a deal breaker on its own (provided it’s option b ) but with the other unmet needs it def paints a picture I’m not happy with. I am being eaten up by the insecurity, distance, invalidation, lack of communication, lack of reassurance, etc... 

*sigh*"
AmItheAsshole,fmbgalb,t1_fmbg4a3,1585925771.0,Thank you 🙂
AmItheAsshole,fmbg57z,t1_fmbfswg,1585925686.0,Well shit.
AmItheAsshole,fmbg0yy,t1_fmbfld0,1585925619.0,"Thank you so much. I’ve been putting up with bullshit my whole life. I’m actually really proud of myself for how close I am to being able to leave it behind. I’ve never broken up with someone before, for real. Anyway, thank you."
AmItheAsshole,fmbfr1k,t1_fmbfh59,1585925460.0,You’re not wrong. It’s hard to know where he’s at or what he actually wants. He literally does not tell me! I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know himself.
AmItheAsshole,fmbf98e,t1_fmbel99,1585925165.0,"I mean, I think he’s worth all the effort I’ve put in up to now. In the end I have to choose one of us, and that’s not fair, but I have to pick me, right? I’m tired of questioning myself and trying to be better all by myself. If I thought he really was willing to put in as much effort as I am it would be different. 

He is worth it, but so am I, and those things mean different outcomes."
AmItheAsshole,fmbezlc,t1_fmbeimf,1585925006.0,It’s just... yeah. I know.
AmItheAsshole,fmbes0u,t1_fmbe9q2,1585924882.0,"No, definitely not. He’s not abusive, at least not in a way that makes it onto my radar (cuz I’ve seen some shit). I also don’t think he’s being emotionally withholding on purpose. 

I have severe mental illnesses, which I’d rather not disclose, that help me judge myself to be human debris in all applicable scenarios. 

I’m winning at life.


Oh, but thank you for looking out for me 🙂"
AmItheAsshole,fmbdzk3,t1_fmbdgy2,1585924416.0,I want that depth so badly! It sucks so bad to know what I’m missing
AmItheAsshole,fmbdsnz,t1_fmbd4k7,1585924305.0,"lol, I am tho! But yeah, it could be the same thing but why not just say that then? Why make me worry and wonder? 

Also, seriously- if your best friend didn’t tell you he had a girlfriend for two years (!!!!) wouldn’t you be legit pissed off? I would be livid! I feel bad for his friend as much as me! 
But, maybe he’s thinking this, too- “I can’t tell him *now* cuz he’ll be pissed I didn’t tell him sooner.” But seriously, I know he doesn’t want to marry me ( not overly happy about that) but what if the first time his friend heard about me was at our wedding?! Jesus Christ..."
AmItheAsshole,fmbdar8,t1_fmbcfdl,1585924010.0,He’s definitely not moving the relationship forward of his own volition. I often think I’m a placeholder so he doesn’t have to be alone.
AmItheAsshole,fmbd4pq,t1_fmbbzzf,1585923909.0,"I just wish he’d be honest about the reason, no matter what it is"
AmItheAsshole,fmbd15p,t1_fmbc2pj,1585923851.0,I’ve often wondered if this is casual for him. It certainly appears to be at times.
AmItheAsshole,fmbcw5w,t1_fmbadon,1585923769.0,I really want it to not be that!
AmItheAsshole,fmbcu3c,t1_fmba7sc,1585923735.0,"Shit, I dunno, cuz she’s bad at conversations? Christ, it’s cuz I’m a terrible person, obviously! I’ll work on it..."
AmItheAsshole,fmbcnih,t1_fmbadf6,1585923631.0,"As far as i know, the friend is male. This situation is a fraction of why I’m considering breaking it off. I don’t think the communication situation is going to change, and that’s a larger piece.

And thanks 🙂"
AmItheAsshole,fmb9rlt,t1_fmb9i4w,1585921858.0,"I mean, same! It’s not enough for my mental health, and in the end that’s going to be the deciding factor, esp now with social distancing. The glue in this relationship was physical intimacy (not just sex) and without that I’m really starting to feel like needs are really not being met that really *need* to be, for my sanity."
AmItheAsshole,fmb9ht7,t1_fmb97k4,1585921683.0,"You’re right, I don’t want to force him to do something he doesn’t feel comfortable with. I have approached actual conversations about it with a fair bit of hostility (nothing inappropriate imo) so maybe I’d get farther if he didn’t feel attacked about it"
AmItheAsshole,fmb98mv,t1_fmb8r07,1585921514.0,"Thank you, I appreciate that validation. Honestly, I’m pretty messed up from previous relationships and trauma and don’t know how to trust my thoughts and feelings at this point."
AmItheAsshole,fmb93h0,t1_fmb8l9f,1585921421.0,Right right right- but I would in a second if he ASKED me to. If he wanted to meet her I would never say no.
AmItheAsshole,fmb8yjj,t1_fmb82n4,1585921332.0,"Emotionally distant people are really, really not good for me. I should have listened to him when he told me at the beginning he didn’t talk about feelings. I’m probably the asshole For Sure for overestimating my mental health and ability to stay sane with little to no feedback about anything."
AmItheAsshole,fmb8tr8,t1_fmb7tjr,1585921243.0,"Jesus I know, that is def on the short list of reasons I imagine. I don’t want to go down that road and start accusing him of that level of deceit, but it’s fucking hard not to think stuff like that."
AmItheAsshole,fmb8n2k,t1_fmb7qxl,1585921119.0,"I already feel really foolish for putting up with it this long, but it’s hard because I love lots of things about him, and there are ways he’s very good to me and good for me. It’s just, I mean, this isn’t the only place my needs aren’t getting met. There are lots. I just want to know if I’m really making something out of nothing with this..."
AmItheAsshole,fmb8dek,t1_fmb7mwm,1585920936.0,"He sees this guy probably once a week, I don’t get told where he’s at a lot of the time, and that’s generally ok with me. He does not have other friends he hangs out with to my knowledge. I do not see him everyday; usually twice a week but not at all now cuz covid19 (and I’m losing my mind). Twice a week was never enough for me, but he’s introverted and at times really busy."
AmItheAsshole,fmb84pm,t1_fmb73m8,1585920767.0,"I do feel like something is wrong. It’s really hard not to make guesses at what it’s about. I feel like I’m not important enough to him, but I don’t know that’s true."
AmItheAsshole,fmb7tbr,t1_fmb739c,1585920542.0,"I only have one friend and I’m embarrassed of her (I’m a shitty person) but he has met my mom and my kids. If I had literally even one other friend I would have had us hanging out all the time! 

In the fight he doesn’t say why, he just says “you’re blowing it out of proportion,” and that other stuff about my giving it “meaning.” He also said, “I’m not trying to hide anything from you.” I did ask him why, and he either dodged or I dropped it, I can’t remember exactly."
AmItheAsshole,fmb7h4p,t1_fmb6p2m,1585920303.0,"I would like to feel like he’s proud of me, values me, or wants to show me off. I’m not especially attractive but I feel like I’m passable. 

Is he just valuing his feelings/ needs over my hurt feelings/needs? I don’t know that it’s fair to be too hard on him for that."
AmItheAsshole,fmb6qlm,t1_fmb6c4a,1585919786.0,"Apologies, I believe he meant it like, it would mean something to me; like I’m investing the meeting of this friend with value it doesn’t have. Not that he’s denying it to me because it means something to *him*."

BoJackHorseman,fjpk2ro,t3_fephr7,1583552922.0,"I thought the ""I see you"" element of Bojack's monologue was more of a window into his deeper issues. For Bojack, it was his mother acknowledging his existence which cut him deeply and made him question whether he still cared for his mother, or was sad that she died. This shows us just how deeply Bojack is desperate to be seen, and therefore how desperate he is for fame and admiration. Anyway I guess I'm with you, it doesn't matter if she was actually talking about him."
