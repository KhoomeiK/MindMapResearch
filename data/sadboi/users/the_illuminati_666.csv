Beatmatch,f22gluj,t1_f226pin,1569888619.0,"Well, first there is the issue of beatmatching. Many DJ's would say you're not really a DJ if you can't beatmatch, maybe that's snobbish, but I find my abilities to beatmatch very useful.   


And then there is the issue of software. Maybe you don't care about this if you're lugging your own gear around. Pioneer is the standard for DJ equipment. Yeah there are some others out there, but as a guy who lives in Brooklyn and sees what's in the clubs, it's pretty much Pioneer. So if  you ever want to perform in a real club, then you're going to need to know how all that Pioneer shit works, as well as how to beatmatch.   


In my opinion (and yes I'll take the hate for it) a DJ is someone who can walk into a club with a USB stick filled with songs, and then make the place explode. There's a lot that goes into doing that but the mixups you can do, and the transitions...it's just so much more fun on a DJ controller than it is on a Push.  JMI"
