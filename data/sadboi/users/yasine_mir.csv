I dont think having a 3.78 vs a 3.8 is what will be a deciding factor in your admission to a medical school

schizophrenia,f9chq2z,t3_e4e6br,1575223820.0,"Weed triggers psychosis and I can tell when my brother had smoked because even when taking his medication, he comes home and starts to have auditory hallucinations and starts yelling at my family members for trying to ""Control"" his mind. I understand it can affect everyone differently but it is still a psychoactive drug that can be detrimental when used by a person who already has an imbalance. My brother also got into 3 accidents that he has no recollection of  at all because he got high and tried to drive home."

schizophrenia,f8xmgo7,t3_e2pksx,1574923983.0,"My twin brother has developed schizophrenia as well. If theres anything that has helped me in the past year it's that you really have to put yourself in their shoes. It helps when you're in a time where your patience is wearing thin. I used to get so mad at my brother and argue with him trying to get him to take his medication and convince him he is in psychosis which just broke my trust with him and ruined our relationship. My brother has Anosagnosia which is common in around half of schizophrenics and means that he doesn't have insight into the fact that he has a mental illness which makes treatment incredibly hard. From what ive read and what doctors and psychologists have told me, if your loved one is expressing their delusion to you, don't agree or reinforce their delusion but also don't argue with them about it. The best way is to change the subject or in a very polite way express that you both have different views on the world. Hope this helps."
