AmItheAsshole,fog9e1n,t3_g6xljq,1587749649.0,"My sister does the same thing to me lol she will go on and on about how I’m her “best friend” (she’s done this for years, since we were kids).  I love her!  So much!  But I wouldnt go so far as to say that we’re best friends (which I struggle with feelings of guilt over.  I have a lot of guilty feelings that I struggle with tho, but that’s what I have a therapist for lol). At any rate, she got married almost a year ago, and what she did was make me and her ACTUAL best friend co-maids of honor.  I have to say, it worked out perfectly, and I was really glad to have a partner to tag team all the MOH duties with.  It worked out so well that I would definitely do the same thing (if I ever get engaged, and assuming I have a traditional wedding haha).  I’m gonna say NAH"
BipolarReddit,fnosee7,t1_fnnow9s,1587132666.0,"Like most people, I’ve tried many many different combos of meds, but what’s been working for me over the last couple years is Wellbutrin, Depakote and Rexulti.  It’s worked well, I’m happy with the cocktail.  It obviously doesn’t fix everything, but it takes the edge off the extreme emotions without any negative side effects that I’ve noticed"

AmItheAsshole,fmjolkf,t3_fvl3yx,1586134538.0,"NAH, if your friends and family know that you’re like this, then idn why they would press the matter.  If you’re friend is in need and they’re reaching out to u for support, but you can’t be bothered, I mean, that sucks of u as a friend.  BUT, if they know u to be this type of person, then they should know that you aren’t someone that they should be reaching out to for support in the first place. They would be setting themselves up for disappointment and further hurt if they did.   This is coming from someone with Bipolar Disorder who finds texting people back during a depressive episode incredibly difficult.. the people that know me, know this.  And I don’t go to people for support who I know I can’t get support from.  I don’t set myself up for that."
BipolarReddit,fmezp22,t1_fmdm1gg,1586016983.0,"Honestly, I start to act differently when I’m in these situations.  I do what I’m there to do, (shower, pee, whatever) but I do it as if I’m in public and other people r watching.  I mean, that’s what it feels like anyway, even though there are no physical people there, so I start to act as though there are.  And you know how you act differently when you’re alone versus when you’re in public?  Like, when you’re alone and relaxed, you don’t ask yourself those questions, “am I sitting weird?” “Do I have something on my face?” “Does my hair look ok if I put it up like this?” “Am I walking funny?” Etc., those r the questions I’ll be asking myself when I’m alone in those vulnerable moments.  Which should be irrational, I mean, who cares about those things, YOU’RE ALONE!  But I don’t feel alone.. at all.  And it’s usually spirits that I know or have known.. which makes it worse.  Especially when I’m masturbating, it totally gets me out of that space and I just hope to god they aren’t watching me do it.. but then I start to think, if I were a spirit, and could go anywhere and be a fly on the wall, wouldn’t I watch people too?  I also have an irrational fear that there are cameras in every bathroom I go into, and I’m being filmed.  Which isn’t actually as irrational as the other thing, cuz it happens more often than it should, unfortunately"

BipolarReddit,fmcm424,t3_fuf58q,1585948312.0,"My whole life, and still to this day, I have had irrational feelings that the spirits of dead people were/are watching me at my most vulnerable moments, ie masturbating, peeing, showering, etc.  I can’t shake this feeling like I’m being watched.  I am aware of how ridiculous it sounds, but I still get self conscious whenever I pee or something because I feel like someone I can’t see is watching me.. I cannot shake the idea/feeling"

sex,f96ho72,t3_e3twec,1575145269.0,"For me, I can’t have much direct stimulation on my clit, it’s just way too sensitive.  I like it best when I rub around it, either on top, or on the left side.  Definitely gonna echo what other are saying that once you find a rhythm, stick to it and don’t change anything if/when she says she’s gonna cum.  I also really like being fingered in addition to clit play- some shallow strokes, then a couple deep, hard ones, and follow that pattern over and over again.  That kind of rhythm feels great for me in PIV too!"

BipolarReddit,f6cjbn6,t1_f6956bt,1572786109.0,"Thank you so much for this!!  Advice can be helpful, but what I find even more helpful is just finding other people who can relate.  Other people that say, “hey, you’re not crazy, I feel EXACTLY the same way!”.  So, even though (so far, at least) you’re the only person who (verbally) replied to my post, your one reply (as well as all the upvotes!) is/are a huge reassurance that I’m not alone, and that is incredibly relieving.  Thank you again!

Edit:  this was my first reddit post, and I didn’t see all the other comments! I’m still getting the hang of using the app :)

Edit, Edit:  thank you everyone for all your comments, what an awesome community this is, I’m so grateful my friend told me about it!  I do have a therapist (I see her later today, actually) and we’re actively working on these things together.  Being part of a community, and knowing I’m not alone, and that other people struggle with these same issues is wildly comforting.  And the people who have struggled with these issues, but don’t anymore, are wildly inspiring!  I’m just thankful for all the feedback. I’m gonna go reread the thread another ten times.  Thank you everyone!"
