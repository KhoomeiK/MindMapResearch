Being an art major, I never asked for criticism, it’s always forced upon me and my fellow classmates. You don’t have to ask for criticism to be criticized. And if I say the next is too long, what do you think the artist will do? Make the neck longer? No. It’s obvious how to fix a mistake such as that. Even bough piper has a long ass neck in game, it stood out to me more in this picture."

No one can save me now 
The voices inside are one of the few things I fear 
It’s under my skin and behind my eyes 
It’s using my face as an ugly disguise
