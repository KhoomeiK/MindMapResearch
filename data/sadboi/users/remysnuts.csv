If you’re using it for bad reasons to ‘fix’ and suppress your anxiety/depression etc it’ll make it worse as you’re relying on it. If you’re smiling it for all the right reasons like to relax after a long day or because you’re genuinely happy then that’s fine. I smoke occasionally, from being someone who smoked daily so I could cope with my anxiety I ended up developing crippling anxiety and very severe depression to the point I was really paranoid. But you can always heal yourself from it which is what I did. Stopped smoking for a little bit and worked on myself for a while then it come to a time to smoke and I was actually content with life, didn’t use it to fix me or suppress any emotions but just to chill out and have a good time. I rarely experience anxiety or panic attacks and rarely am I depressed more just sad. So it’s not like that for everyone, some people just don’t realise why they’re smoking and end up like you said over-indulging which is never good where it is more than ok to indulge once in a while."

It is also not your responsibility to get him the help he needs and it’s not your job to change him.
But being a person who experienced very very bad anxiety once upon a time, all we want is reassurance, patience and understanding but most of all love and support. 
Try giving him an ultimatum but love him from a distance. Relationships are never easy, they can take ages to work on. Maybe try communicating with each other why these things are happening, ask him what is the underlying issue with his anxiety/panic without him pointing any fingers at anyone and taking full responsibility for himself. There is a lot you can do even if you don’t want to be with him, the communication is a great way to start."

Another thing, give him small jobs around the house for you to do, clean the house, do some washing, dishes, vacuum the floor, ask him to do you small favours like ‘can you please grab me a glass of water or can you please make the bed for me’. 
My partner never used to do dishes or even really clean until he met me and it just started off with all the small jobs and eventually he started doing bigger jobs until I stopped asking and he just takes the initiative and does it on his own.

Your father obviously needs help too. You don’t go around hitting people you love because they don’t do what you say. You just don’t hit anyone full stop. The way people treat others is a reflection of themselves and how they’re feeling inside. And that’s very sad that your father feels the need to go around hurting people because of his own pain and suffering. As hard as it is, you need to be compassionate from all perspectives and realise that he’s just in an immense amount of pain. 

Your poor mother for having to endure it and pay for what he’s going through. Really there is nothing you can do unless they both decide to change. Either he gets help or she realises this is not ok and leaves him.

What you could maybe try is find ways of empowering her and helping from a distance. Give her some self care reads, help her understand her self worth. Try teaching her about self respect and self love too. Once someone really realises what the full meaning and putting it into action, they won’t stand for anything less than they deserve.

I learned that if something in life isn’t benefiting you, you’re allowed cut it off if you want.
It makes room for the greater things in life."
AskWomen,fkvp2s6,t3_fkny2v,1584573760.0,"For me personally I worked on myself until I felt like I was ready to get back out there. I started looking after myself, cutting off things that didn’t benefit me and my future meaning partying, drinking, drugs (besides occasional weed), skin care routines, general daily routines, spending time with family. I did slip up for a little bit, well I did slip up a lot throughout that time and I did meet up with a couple people but only as friends. I then met my now partner (of 2 years) and did go through a lot of rough patches but now FOR REAL cutting off everything that is not good for my body because constant bad things you consume come out in your appearance and mood whether it’s actual food or even influences. It’s ok to indulge from time to time but not to over indulge. I’m probably getting way off topic but I’m excited haha."

askwomenadvice,fkuxlme,t3_fkqkd5,1584558034.0,"Freedom. This is where your life truly starts and as a woman we are all who we should be relying on. Ourselves. We don’t need anyone to do anything for us nor will we ever. Unless we like really need it. You come into this world alone, we leave alone too. You got this ❤️"
AskWomen,fktsgih,t3_fkcmtj,1584533136.0,I just know that they are on a different adventure to me. Same goals but different paths.
AskWomen,fktsbyo,t3_fkgv5k,1584533015.0,"Wasn’t so much a long long friendship but it was one I invested a lot of time and energy in. 
Basically he was a really toxic person, manipulative, vindictive and just real bad narcissistic tendencies. Started off living with my family and I for a few months and he was really awesome at the beginning and then out of nowhere he just started acting up, being really condescending and stealing from us etc. 
anyway he ended up moving out and that was a relief. I blocked him on social media. 
Once I got pregnant he started acting all nice to me and stuff, had my baby, he wanted to be the god father and I was like UUUUUMMMM.
Few months go by, I invite him over and all is well until he leaves and my stuff is missing. 
Turns out he stole my stuff while I was upstairs watching movies. 
So much for the god father bs lol. 
Few more months go by, he cries wolf and says he’s moving to a different state because I got back with my partner and refused to choose him over my partner. So our friendship has completely ended. 
Got my stuff back through a friend that lived with him though."
AskWomen,fktqn7w,t3_fkg33e,1584531344.0,I have a pretty kitty. I get her waxed and I wash her with warm water ONLY. Smells good and also having a well balanced diet helps with the smell. I don’t care what people think coz I know she’s beautiful :)
AskWomen,fktqew4,t3_fk57tv,1584531104.0,"Once I had a major spiritual breakthrough last year. It was after my partner and I had temporarily separated. It woke me up to see through all of my shit and change. I needed to grow up and start taking responsibility and start loving myself and treating myself with more love and respect. Right now I am a strong,assertive, beautiful and resilient woman. I have my times where I have set backs but who doesn’t?"
AskWomen,fktq7dd,t3_fkbfi7,1584530881.0,"Didn’t like it one bit. He stunk like an ash tray, breath smelled like shit and honestly I couldn’t stand seeing him abusing and damaging himself/his health. 
He stopped eventually once I stopped nagging and now he vapes and now he doesn’t have to sit outside in the cold and freeze his ass off not only that but he smells like cotton candy. Who doesn’t want that."
AskWomen,fktq104,t3_fk2ply,1584530693.0,"Honestly I didn’t start actually screaming or hurting until I was 10cm. I spent like all my time in the shower. But yeah man, once you get to a certain point it sorta hurts a little 😂
Period cramps are more dull tbh"
