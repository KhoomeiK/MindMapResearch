Some do it as they know it's a violent outlet that will hurt ultimately no one, because they do not want to hurt anyone. even in the isntant. It's also what Johnny Depp was accused of (a video Amber posted of him violently smashing cupboards as demonstration of his 'violent' behaviour) before we all found out Amber Heard was the real abuser. I feel like it may be true for certain cases or this individual, but it's kind of dangerous to say smashing cupboards is equivalent to hitting your spouse. I feel like if the roles were reversed, and it was the woman breaking stuff, you wouldn't be thinking she'd turn into a violent abuser. Hell, I know my friend, who is going through a rough separation from her emotionally abusive, compulsively lying husband, recently had an incident where she found evidence of his marital cheating and broke/smashed  abunch of pics of them. She was angry. Would she be the type to ever lay a hand on her spouse? No. Does she beat or abuse her spouse? No. So it's a weird thing to accuse someone of maybe doing based on very little evidence."
