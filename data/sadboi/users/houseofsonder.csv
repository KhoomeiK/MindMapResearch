bioengineering,fh6us3h,t1_fh6rp5y,1581306625.0,"I’m was a bioengineering major. That meant I took classes in pretty much every engineering field while in university because the major is so diverse.  I find it immensely rewarding to work on tools that will help people live healthier lives and constantly learn from many different fields. 

If you’re looking to switch fields into medical devices, apply for a job in that area. They share the same foundational field. Biomedical device companies likely have mechanical roles open and they’ll bring you on if you have the relevant skills. You can then learn on the job and on your own time to grow into a mechanical bioengineering role. That is a great place to settle and get comfortable or you can transition out if you’d like. 

Jumping from mechanical engineering to synthetic biology (the foundational field is biology) is harder. You’re going to want to take some biology classes at your community college or online (or even buy/borrow the book and self study) and focus on genetics and molecular biology. You’ll also want to enroll in lab sections so you get the hands-on experience. Some synthetic biology companies hire mechanical engineers so you may find a way in from there. They can also be interested in software engineers so if you have strong skills, that can get you a role as well. 

At the end of the day, there is no one path to get to where you want to be. You could even go back to school and get a masters degree if you wanted. Informational interview as can help you figure out if this field has what you’re looking for."
bioengineering,fh6kxjr,t3_f1i5fb,1581300707.0,"I’m a bioengineer in the US. It’s varied depending on what you do exactly. One of my coworkers is a microfluidics guy. One of my coworkers is a genetic engineering gal. We have a guy who does a lot of chemistry stuff. 

The main difference between a biologist and an engineer is the emphasis on engineering principles and skills. As a bioengineer you’ll likely learn more advanced mechanical, electrical, etc. engineering skills along side your biology course work. You’re also going to learn to comply with the FDA (or other governing body), bioethics, and other related areas.

Once you hit the field, you’ll find that you get slotted into a role. You’re not necessarily responsible for the whole process, like you learn in school. You’ll be grouped up with designers and engineers from different backgrounds to make the best device, system, etc. possible. You may even go into fields like quality engineering or validation engineering, which lean heavily on the communication and interdisciplinary skills you learned in your course work. 

What your day looks like will change depending on exactly what you choose to do. I can tell you that every day is going to be different and you’re going to learn a lot. My day goes:

*Badge in. 

*Check all the water, CO2, liquid N2, etc. levels. Refill as necessary. 

*Check cells and write down their growth. Feed them if necessary. 

*Go to my desk and have a cup of tea.  Make sure I log all the data above. 

*Check my to do list. 

*Start morning experiment (genetic engineering), work on experiment set up (JMP or mechanical/electrical engineering stuff)  or head to the clean room (lithography and microfluidics) to unload runs from last night and do some work on them. 

*Break for meeting somewhere in there, if there is one. 

*Eat lunch with co-workers. 

*Start afternoon experiment or work on experiment set up. Might be more clean room work. 

*Meeting. 

*Start afternoon experiment or head over to clean room to set up overnight runs. 

*Note what I’ve accomplished that day and make a list for what I’ll do tomorrow and later that week given what I learned from today.

*Badge out."

MakeupRehab,ffgjtck,t1_ffgcwlf,1579907872.0,"Afterpay is one of those things that I find difficult to reconcile. Terry Pratchett describes the problem it is meant to address in one of his books, Men at Arms. 

“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”

We can agree that that is unfair. It’s punishing people for not having enough right now. In that sense, I’m all for Afterpay making that an option in letting people have what they want. It’s good for the world! It’s good for people! 

I’m not for afterpay on CP of all places where their fast fashion turn around and pricing means you’ll be digging deeper in debt every three weeks, if you can’t afford the order now. It just incentivizes a hit of serotonin while creating the illusion that this won’t cost you much. It’s not our place to police people but god, I wish people wizened up to why it’s there."

In fact, you can move across fields in your career. Your path is more fluid than you could imagine. I worked short stints in education then fundraising then marketing then education again and am currently a bioengineer. 

There’s many paths in bioengineering. The area I work in, instrumentation, only requires a little chemistry. I used to do a lot of genetic engineering and that was still mostly biology over chemistry. These classes are your foundation for critical thinking. I remember how hard it was to learn to think critically and clearly so quickly. The fact you’re here asking for help speaks to your willingness to grow and learn. That’s a good place to start. 

If I was in your shoes I would take a broad base of basic engineering courses that will set me up to transfer to another form of engineering if I don’t like it. Others mentioned but mechanical, electrical, materials, and chemical. There are a ton of different sub disciplines (nanotech or biomaterial!) and they have similar roots in math, physics, etc. Try working a bit in a research lab or shadow an engineer in the field to get an idea of what the day to day is like.

MakeupRehab,f8wtjx1,t3_e2i8le,1574899539.0,"I tried a palette that’s more browns than I usually use. I’m liking it, but I’ve found the balance of colors on this palette isn’t quite right. It leans a little too hard on highlight and transition shades. It also needs primer, which my other palette doesn’t need. I can make three or four really solid looks though!"
MUAontheCheap,f8vzkjg,t1_f8vw0xh,1574880384.0,They’re still on Sephora. It’s honestly made me mad that I bought them Monday and they’re more discounted today.
MUAontheCheap,f8u19nd,t1_f8tzcrf,1574816536.0,Pretty sure it was 5 minis for 25 three or four years ago.
MUAontheCheap,f8r4wb6,t1_f8r4hvq,1574732029.0,Update: it’s six palettes. Main squeeze. Orange you glad. Uh huh Honey. Just my luck. Blue moon. It’s my pleasure.
MUAontheCheap,f8r4hvq,t3_e1kce8,1574731752.0,They have a palette vault going for about 50 USD and I really wonder how many palettes it is. Rainbow? So seven?
MUAontheCheap,f8at6oh,t3_dzn9un,1574410625.0,"I think I’m gonna skip on this one. I can’t think of anything I want. Maybe the cruelly highlighter, but I won’t use it enough with the putty formula. (Pls let me know if there’s any awesome items I should consider trying.)"

I got the preview off the app. There is living proof, Korres, etc."

MakeupRehab,f868lue,t1_f8653cm,1574292384.0,"The collection doesn’t get smaller. That’s the problem. OP is looking to let go and these are products OP does not love. If they go to people who will love them, then better for the items. 

Let’s take a look at what you’ve proposed: OP buys A. OP buys B. OP buys C. There’s no guarantee OP is going to finish anything so B sticks around. Now the collection is composed of A, B, and C. 

Yes, it costs more money. However, OP hasn’t mentioned that being the reason why they joined rehab. It seems more accurate that the reason they joined was appreciate what they have and not be swayed by what people tell them to buy."

My own tip: They keep sending me the “We miss you!” Emails. When I worked in email marketing, we relied heavily on sounding like your friend to pull you in. Do not fall for it. Unsubscribe or block them."

MakeupRehab,f7ido2o,t1_f7iadid,1573757758.0,I’m a fan of the Nars one and Coola’s.
MUAontheCheap,f7c2rlw,t1_f7c1sno,1573583136.0,I love it. It’s super moisturizing and soaks right in. It’s good for layering. A small amount on one pass gives you solid moisture. A second pass works amazing for the worst cold/dry days.
