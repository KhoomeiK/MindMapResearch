Documentaries,fr3rdyg,t1_fr1o02l,1589864206.0,"So background information: as a kid I was sort of a pathological liar.  I had a pretty shitty childhood and it probably started as a defense mechanism of sorts, but by young adulthood it was a pretty ingrained habit and I was almost incapable of dealing with anything uncomfortable in a direct manner. I don't know.  I've been reformed for about a decade now, FWIW.

Anyway, my run-in with Popoff happened in my early 20s.  I had two small kids, was going through a shitty divorce, working two jobs, and going to school full-time.  Something had to give, so I decided to quit one of my jobs and withdraw from my classes for the semester.  Of course, being a young liar and sort of mentally unstable I couldn't just...quit.  I had to turn it into a *thing.*  So, as embarrassing as it is to admit, I pretended to have been diagnosed with some disease so that I could leave the job without giving a two weeks' notice and also get a medical withdrawal from school (so my financial aid wouldn't be affected).  

I guess word got out around town that I was sick, because my old best friend from high school called me up not long afterwards, to invite me to this faith healing thing.  She'd gotten super evangelical in marriage, and I'm Jewish and not particularly religious, but thought fuck it, why not.  Free pizza, right?

Imagine my surprise when the motherfucker called me up to the front.  Freaked me the fuck out because now I'm standing in front of this crowd being healed for this fake-ass disease I don't really have, and everyone's acting like this huge miracle is happening.  His handlers, like, pulled me aside afterwards and grilled me about my condition for HOURS, trying to get me to ""testify"" on camera, and when I wouldn't do that they tried to guilt me into giving them money.  When it became apparent that I was broke and not going to become a donor they dropped me hard and fast.  I can't imagine how devastating it would have been if I'd really been sick and a believer.  Or what I might have done to stay in his good graces, at that point. 

It was awful, and by far one of the most surreal experiences of my life.  For years it sort of haunted me that he ""knew"" my secret, and made me doubt a lot of my beliefs.  It took me forever to figure out that my friend must have filled out some sort of prayer card or something, tipping him off.

In a bit of a karmic twist, though, the whole ordeal later became the basis for what would become my first big publication, when I started dabbling in fiction, and indirectly led to my current career.  So whatever; joke's on you, Popoff."

I've got an 18 year old who just enlisted in the Marines, tells us he loves us every time he leaves the house, and threw exactly one fit in the grocery store growing up: he was three and he wanted to take home a stalk of broccoli to make with dinner but we weren't going straight home and I didn't want it wilting in the heat and stinking up the car.  He did not get to take the broccoli home, even after an old lady pitied him and bought it as a gift.  He made straight A's all through school, lettered in every sport offered, and was homecoming king.  We had a total of one fight during his high school career, the week before freshman year started, and I can't recall ever seriously arguing with him.

My 17 year old is a junior and more of a loner.  He was my shadow up until a couple of years ago.  He suffers from OCD and anxiety (as do  I) and had a long bout of depression in early high school, but never had a single mental-health related outburst, and insists that he doesn't have it so bad, since others have it worst.  He's exceedingly gentle: he cried over accidentally smashing bugs he'd met, as a smaller child, and is now the biggest pet/animal advocate I know, though he can't really stand many humans.  We do argue now, too alike probably, but have never had an actual fight.  

My two year old is probably the happiest, most independent child I've ever known, even though she has a severe speech delay that would cause severe frustrationin many toddlers.  I work from home and she'll play next to me for hours, happily reading, coloring, stacking blocks, climbing shelves, trampolining on the sofa, sitting on the table.  You name it.  She's never met a stranger, and even shares her toys.  She eats salad at every meal, cries at night if we don't start putting her to bed on time, and puts herself down for a nap during the day.  She's wild.

My six month old, well, if I were going to hit any of them then it would be him, obviously.  But he's already another good sleeper, so I haven't had a good excuse yet.

Anyway, you get my point.  I've got great kids who weren't spanked, and your friend has a brat.  I was a good kid who was hit, and my brother was a  brat.  There are a million of those stories.  Don't make life decisions based on one interaction with one kid; do your research."

AskReddit,fpj8r4n,t1_fpiz0mo,1588660037.0,"I'm getting old, and have been through a lot of therapy and medication for CPTSD.  I really thought I was mostly okay with stuff like that now, but when my son was a few months old he gave us a few weeks' hell with sleeping.  One night my wife just sort of lost her temper as she woke up for her turn to go comfort him.  She knocked something over when she got up and then screamed at it/stomped the floor out of something like frustration, sleep-deprivation, and defeat. I've never seen her do anything like it before or since. 

Pretty sure I jumped about 6 feet from a half-awake state, when she did, though.  Just everything on high alert and heart pounding in my chest.  I will say that it took me a couple of hours to come down from it, so she ended up stuck with me freaking out much longer than it took the baby to fall back to sleep. (Karma, is that you?)  

My dad was a night owl, though, so it makes sense I guess.  We were all dragged from bed in the middle of the night, or woken to hear him beating the shit out of my mom, so many times growing up.  That shit can sneak up on you."

I made the damn thing beautifully to his specs, playing around with the cheese to make sure it would cover everything without dripping off everywhere, he picked it up, all is well in the world.

About an hour later my GM comes in and the second call she takes is from a guy complaining that there was no pepperoni on a pizza he'd picked up earlier and asking for a replacement to be delivered.  I looked at the phone number and sure enough, it was quadruple cheese guy.

I explained the situation and why I KNEW it had pepperoni, but she still remade the pizza, delivered it herself, and came back annoyed.  She'd let him keep the original because, ""well, I looked at it and didn't see any pepperoni, so you *must* have forgotten them."""

AskReddit,fp73odj,t1_fp6msf8,1588363465.0,"I think they were specifically asking about the 5-7 pm dinner visit being such a short amount of time to bother visiting at once, and whether that was normal.

The real answer to *that* question is that, yes, it is a ridiculously short amount of time to give for a visit, but it is just part of the Standard Possession Order in many places.  In TX, for example, the SPO for noncustodial parents of children over 3 years old means they get 1st, 3rd and 5th weekends from 6pm Fri to 6pm Sunday, and Thursday nights from 6-8 pm for dinner.  (Plus allowing for long weekends over school holidays and etc.)

You can petition for more, obviously, which gets into the territory of your answer, but that's ultimately up to the judge if the other parent isn't on board, and statistics on that being granted vary wildly from state to state.  

Anyway, NAL, just a dad whose ex has an SPO with the exception that my son goes overnight on Thursdays because I think the two hours thing is, as stated, ridiculous.  Also we go 5pm-5pm Fri-Sun because we live in a small city with no traffic and he wasn't driving yet when it was set, so that way he could be picked up right after work on Fridays."

Also four kids, one who lives in my garage apartment and just enlisted in the Marines, one I barely see because he's got his sleep schedule all fucked up from finishing his junior year playing video games in quarantine, and two that are two and under (from a third marriage; a happy marriage).

I've been through similar enough to more than a few of the experiences you've mentioned, that your post just resonated with me.  Just a few nights ago I sat out and had a few beers with my wife and marveled on how young I feel.  Goddamn if I didn't think I'd just die when depression hit me hard that first time; all that time spent in the hospital.  Fuck if that wasn't more than 20 years ago now.  I'm also run ragged and deliriously happy enough with my life now that I feel even better than I probably did at 25, when I wanted to be Kurt Cobain and join the 27 club.

But I really have to thank you for that last bit.  I try to remind myself constantly that I'd never treat a friend the way my head does me.  And it's still difficult to stop sometimes.  But life is awesome, even though I'm exhausted and in a bit of a rut in my work (I work from home and make well, well, above minimum wage: how many people wish they had my problems?), even though my kid stormed off and hated me tonight because I told him I was canceling his insurance until I feel it's safe for him to actually go places, because $600 a month for him to sit around on our policy is...bad business.

But see, I get that fear of being stuck.  I get why he was upset, even though he's literally only left the house twice to go visit my ex, in the past 8 weeks.  My ex who can pick him up if he wants to visit again.  

I was offered a job yesterday.  I teach at the university level and this was for a test-prep course, contingent on proposal, that will pay more than double what I make now, they simply want me to tell them why to hire me, that isn'ton my resume.  I spent the day working on the damned thing, researching, revising, have had it looked over, and have sat here now for a few hours trying to  convince myself to send it, even though that little voice keeps saying it's all bullshit and I can't deliver.

toddlers,fno4bvq,t1_fn89rc2,1587111574.0,"I'll add on here that my daughter was the same way, and now at 27 months she's pretty much the most independent thing there is.  I feel almost guilty seeing everyone having such a hard time working from home when I do it full time all the time.  (Plus a 5 month old.)  She's just great at entertaining herself.  Mine is also very friendly and loves being around people, loves meeting new kids at the park, never met a stranger...she's just also just as happy wandering around playing alone if no one else is there.  Trust me, we're going to feel guilty about about a million more things over the next 20 years, just enjoy this one :)"
toddlers,fno3iql,t3_g0mqgp,1587110723.0,"My daughter turned two in January and had about the same number of words as yours.  She would say num (for food), wow, no, noooooooooooo!, and what's that?  We were referred to ECI, got put on a waitlist, and then sort of got caught up in all of this madness for a couple of months.  

Half figured it was a lost cause but I called our center on Monday and they said they've been working on getting Zoom sessions set up, and we have a phone consultation tomorrow.  So keep trying!  Places can't afford to just shut down if there's any way around it, so we do have that going for us.

Also, I wish I could tell you she's blossomed or something in the past three months, but not really.  She has picked up maybe one a week, though, so I feel like she'll get there eventually/is capable of it.

I know how frustrating and shitty it feels, to not be able to know what's wrong, or be able to reason with them.  I see all these quarantine potty training posts and I start to feel pretty defeated.  Like...yeah, wouldn't it be nice to be able to have that conversation with the kid?

Someone recommended us the Speech Blubs app, but I haven't tried it yet.  I like the resources and podcast [here](speechandlanguagekids.com).  There are a few speech pathologists who do telehealth that I've run across online who may be worth reaching out to for even a consult, since that might give you a better idea of where to go while you wait on your local place.

Good luck!  Feel free to reach out anytime.  If you're interested then I don't mind keeping you updated on what goes on for us over the next weeks/months, especially resources and etc.  Anything to help while things are still so wild out there."

Parenting,fn54wx4,t1_fn0ymbe,1586656004.0,"As far as the fact that they didn't have a deeper conversation it might be a good idea to remind him also that some people are just awkward in different situations.  13 isn't really known for being a time when you have meaningful conversations with your buddies with both of your families sitting in watching.  Maybe Brian was nervous and dealing with it via bravado, etc. 

My oldest son was (still is at nearly 19) a lot like yours, just an extremely smart, pretty sensitive, very thoughtful kid, but that could lead to some pretty black and white thinking when he thought he knew the best way.  Sometimes hurt feelings and existential despair just needed a little reminder of ways to show grace to those he was having a hard time understanding."

Parenting,fn4neon,t3_fz6gn3,1586644956.0,"My 17 year old was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss at 4; though I'd suspected it for a little while by then we couldn't get any definite results until then.  He's worn hearing aids since, and at this point they're just part of him.  Some thoughts on the hearing aids:

We dealt with a very small amount of teasing in early elementary school so I started going in at the beginning of each year and giving a presentation with him so the kids could ask questions, look over an old pair, etc. I'd say they gave him super-hearing like Superman, and really hype them up, and that helped a lot when they were little.

Go with the pair rated highest against moisture and debris that you can afford because you don't want him to have to take it easy on the playground or in sports, or have to take them out to keep from ruining them with dust and sweat while he plays.

Go ahead and set the subtitles on all of your screens and streaming platforms and get used to it.  My kid can't watch without them even with his hearing aids in.  Movie theaters don't work for him, which sucks now that he's a teenager and wants to do things like that with friends now and then.  He spends most of his time at his computer where he can control things like that.  Telephone conversations were always really difficult, too.  Texting was a lifesaver.  The dogs can hear him coming home from school (and run to the door) about 20 seconds before I can because he plays the music so loud in his car.  I can hear him halfway down the block.  What am I going to tell him, you'll ruin your hearing?  I think it lets him feel like a normal teenager.

Teach him asap how to test and replace the batteries, how to put them in their case, where to keep the case, etc.  It's something he'll have to be responsible for the rest of his life, so needs to be taught alongside washing his hands and brushing his teeth.  Keep batteries everywhere he goes when he's young, and give the teacher a supply at the beginning of the school year.

Even if it can be managed for now with aids or implants consider learning about the deaf community, and if possible taking sign language classes whenever you can.  Teach him young, and encourage him to keep up with it as he grows.  Hearing can worsen with age, implants can fail, unexpected things can happen.  Deaf culture is rich and fascinating, and for me it seemed no different than the necessity of introducing an adopted child to their culture of heritage.

Most of all, don't worry too much.  I know it's scary but I think it's well on the easy end of disabilities to be managed these days.  It's shaped our lives in small ways, but nothing outrageous.  It's totally doable."
Parenting,fn4isoi,t1_fn39tih,1586642245.0,"Lol, I'm not sure I'd force my 5 and 6 year olds into a contract lasting the span of twice their current lifetimes.  That's more than the equivalent of entering into a mortgage for me.  They have zero concept of what that length of time means.  Can you imagine sitting your 10 and 11 year old down and being like, nope, sorry boys, you signed this sheet of paper half your lives ago, no discussing separate rooms for two more years.  Wtf?  Like would you get it notarized?  Is it still valid if they don't remember having signed it by then?"

Don't make a huge deal of it, but make it clear that this is just the way it is now.  They'll get on board eventually.
