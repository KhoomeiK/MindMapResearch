It’s pretty much the norm in the US now. Even if you pose an argument politely there’s an immediate emotional response. They either stonewall you and refuse to open a dialogue or they start spewing absolutely illogical nonsense like OP and won’t shut up or even listen to a word you say no matter how air tight your argument is.

It’s a claustrophobic feeling. Because as one person I can’t do anything about it and it’s pervasive. Have people always been this fucking stupid? Or have people been diluted by instant gratification and no longer feel any need to educate themselves or read a goddamn book.. fuck

I don’t dispute the fact the US has no healthcare (which is not what you said in the previous message lol). I don’t dispute the fact that it has the most mass shootings either. Yay you learned facts finally. 

But then you lost it with the assumption at the end there. You’re getting close tho. 

There are many scenarios other than whatever you assume guns would be needed or used for. No your cliche “spoiler alert” “take down” point is not a fact. It is your opinion.

OutOfTheLoop,fp7hm0g,t1_fp75rt4,1588370781.0,"Pls read response below. It’s not about whether citizens are or are not exercising the right. The right is necessary if you want to call citizens free.

Otherwise the citizens are subject to unchecked power. You might argue we already are. But that is not a fact and neither is your first statement. How do you know this is a fact? (you’re also just wrong about that one entirely lol)"
OutOfTheLoop,fp7gsoi,t1_fp76gyw,1588370342.0,"We are arguing on different plains of abstraction. 

The things you claim are facts, while maybe good and true, are not facts. Ex: you said “we should be focusing on healthcare” is good and I agree, but it is not a fact. We feel the same way and share the same opinion but it is an opinion it is not a fact.

Fundamentally the second amendment is necessary for a democracy (or capitalism i guess?). Because without it the armed state is capable of taking unchecked absolute power. Citizens would have no (or minuscule) means of defending their sovereignty. 

It’s the ideal (core idea) of the amendment that sovereign citizens are not sovereign if they have no real means of defending that sovereignty.

Whether it’s 1890 or 2020, this is fundamentally true despite how effective that defense is for a free state. The right to a means of defense is necessary for a “free” society.

(yes Dresden and some of the listed things were awful but again it was in war. Also London was basically flattened by near constant German bombing, so Dresden was somewhat justified from Churchill’s perspective)

Mostly what’s irritating is people getting pissed about imperialism and how indigenous people were “robbed” of “their” land. Like the US and Native Americans. 

Like it was fucked up how it happened, but it happened. So quit bitching about it (not you, just people in general) and enjoy the society we built. It’s nothing new.

All throughout history empires have expanded and taken control of other countries by violent and nonviolent means, both imperialism. Resources, power, strategy, territory or whatever the reason was, it already happened. 

Most likely the more powerful nation benefitted, so why not invade and take what these less advanced people can’t access (like oil)? Because they already live there? Is that the only reason? Sovereign states? I’m not sympathetic. 

Centuries later we now shame ourselves in the US for what happened centuries ago? Get over it and enjoy cruising down four lane highways, using insanely advanced tech, and having access to any information instantly (among many, many other things our imperialism, colonialism afforded us)."

Fair use is pretty ambiguous. Like if your textured ball placed in the middle of someone else’s artwork is considered the most prominent element with the rest of the art only complementing your original work then you’re technically good legally.

The other basis is whether your reproduction (in whole or in part) does damage to the rep or pulls significant profit away from the original artist who would have a pretty good case in my opinion. 

While I doubt you’re putting a dent in Harley’s revenue, the original designer is now competing against their own artwork that (again in my opinion) you really haven’t altered that much besides warping it in photoshop (I assume) and putting a bumpy sphere in the middle of everything. 

There’s a third legal test/standard, but I don’t remember it. Think about the legal stuff, but more importantly think about how you’ll profit off of someone else’s (fucking amazing) work.
