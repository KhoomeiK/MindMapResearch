ExpeditionaryForce,fkg8j8x,t3_f0p5ne,1584152671.0,"I think this ending is bad writing. And the cliffhanger was in bad taste. This series has had cliffhangers before, but they were enjoyable cliffhangers.

This one completely hurt my enjoyment of the book because it was TOO grim, too hurtful relative to the preceding chapters and time-frame shoved into the conclusion.  If this had happened in the middle, or in the beginning of a book, I would've been fine with a devastating gut punch. But at the end? And in such abruptly painful fashion? Why would you do that emotionally to the reader?

And 'abrupt' would be an understatement to describe the delivery. There was no build up, no hints of unfolding narrative to prepare the readers subconscious for the sudden shock.

Which I'll call out as bad form. Whether by laziness, negligence or ignorance. The fact that the author has complete creative freedom to work with, and chooses to dump some of the most heartbreaking revelations all within a few pages right at the end of the book... is just disappointing. Completely valid for an author to do as he pleases. But very hurtful to readers. We are real people with real feelings and emotional reactions that should also be considered when producing entertainment.

Yes, events will probably resolve somehow in the following books and give closure for the reader. But this was not a tasteful cliffhanger. üëé"

so i definitely identify with the shame, the back and forth of my own expectations for myself, the ups and downs where i question whether i'm actually making progress, whether i'm just not good enough for society's systems, feeling immobile, etc.

so, i hear you.

in the past week i've been having 'Joe vs. the Volcano' moments where i'm also recognizing that i'm miserable. and maybe i just need to fight my fears, make those leaps and do the things i'm afraid of doing. if you haven't seen that film i'd highly recommend it to anyone struggling with mental illness and their work life balance."

BPD,fffskcv,t3_etdkwq,1579890877.0,"i've done two things that were successful for me:

-one is ""ride the wave"". basically i close my eyes and remind myself that emotions are like waves- they rise, peak, then subside eventually. so, when you feel emotions starting to get intense, just wait and don't act on them. eventually they'll go back down. i know it is extremely uncomfortable and you'll feel like you'll lose something if you don't satisfy the feelings. but they're just feelings.

-second is act opposite the emotion. if you're feeling destructive, do something healing. if you're feeling hateful, do something kind, etc. basically what you're doing here is unwiring your brain from what it's used to doing. which is admittedly very difficult and jarring because everything in your being is telling you to satisfy your need to react the way you've been used to reacting. but over time it'll get easier.

i would do either one or the other, not both together. but they've really surprisingly helped me. it takes a lot of work though. and it's extremely uncomfortable. but change isn't comfortable, and that's okay.

hope this helps.

edit: also, sorry about losing people. i definitely understand. and behaviors, thoughts and emotions wrecking havoc on my life and people close to me. currently struggling very much with this myself."

discovered i had bpd end of 2018. but by then, she had too much trauma, so we started going through separation a few months ago. we started seeing other people.

however, during this time i'm realizing how much it's tearing me apart to break up our family unit (we're raising a son together). and i can't handle the separation between us. despite the fact it was me who tore the relationship apart all these years.

so i've been a wreck (like, it got real dark on christmas eve. i was alone in the apartment and not in a safe mindset towards myself)

anyways, i had to stop my new relationship because i can't handle my own intensity with emotions going both ways. and i honestly don't know what's going on with me the majority of the time. it sucks.

how do you love someone without being crazy attached? i don't understand how to cope with that aspect of my disorder because it's tearing me apart inside."

but i think the solution BEGINS with self awareness and more importantly, self forgiveness. but i think to actually HELP the issue, requires actually practicing healthy behaviors. like, learning not to react to your feelings in the moment when they overtake you. the more you practice, your brain will eventually start to re-wire itself.

you should try DBT. it really helped me, even before i learned about bpd. i was in an intensive treatment program years ago, and DBT was what they taught.

of course, all this is easier said than done. because these past couple years have been god awful for me, and i haven't practiced DBT at all."
BPD,fcqe5zs,t3_eappcv,1577884207.0,"ugh. same. my psychiatrist and my previous therapist both avoided a bpd diagnosis. so fucking frustrating.

but, like others mentioned in this thread, it's because they only diagnose what THEY see with their own eyes. and if they don't see it in the 20 minute session, then it doesn't exist and they won't be convinced otherwise.

i've also read that some professionals will consciously avoid bpd altogether because of how notoriously messy it is. which is really fucked up. because it's not fair to the patients who ARE SUFFERING in their lives and need help.

i think this is a flaw in the healthcare industry. because we know ourselves better than any other person. yet, we're reliant on others to tell us who we are and what's wrong with us.

and with bpd, where lack of identity, confusion, difficulties with self validation, and instability are rampant, it's like a major mind fuck when a doctor gives you a generic diagnosis like anxiety or depression. because, inside, we're drowning in a raging sea of chaos."
BPD,fcohzkz,t3_ei9xe3,1577832687.0,"Ditto'd. My SO of 13 years is in process of leaving me. We have a son together.  We only discovered last year I had BPD.

I thought I wanted to leave also, but I didn't realize how much it would tear me apart the reality of breaking apart our family unit. Despite the fact it was me who tore the relationship apart over the years.

So I understand what you're going through. It's very, very rough. I've been in a very dark place the past month because of the devastatingly intense emotions.

This is a difficult, and confusing disorder. Maybe during these times, we should give ourselves credit for simply surviving throughout the years."

But yes, DBT (dialectical behavior therapy), founded by Marsha Linehan (who, I learned today actually has BPD).

Also, regular therapy. For BPD, having a good therapist that understands borderline is crucial. 

Both act as a compass for when you lose your own sense of direction, and hopefully eventually develop your own compass. Autonomy is difficult with BPD, almost like a paradox. So learning those techniques really helps give you that foundation."

one night, i had a dream about us. not the hate part, but the loving part. i broke-down in the dream and woke up crying. and for the next week, i couldn't stop crying. severe, severe bottomless grief replaced the bitterness and hate.

the dream would keep replaying in my head and each time, i'd break down. actually still happens.

i've said so many times that i'm done. and each time feels dangerously closer to being the last time. a few times recently i truly believe it is.  that i simply can't take it anymore. i'd be a liar if i said this didn't happen to me.

on a side note, is it common for bpd's to often feel like they need to find catharsis?  or is that just a normal thing for everyone? this conversation reminded me of my tendency to feel like somehow if i find that, then it might help right things somehow and finally break the constant cycle of anguish. or at least help soften the extremes.

however, there's something i learned in dbt class, about emotions being like waves. they rise, get intense, and then subside. if you recognize this, you can ride out those waves until they subside. and the more you do that, the more your brain adjusts and rewires itself to lessen the need to act on these impulses.
