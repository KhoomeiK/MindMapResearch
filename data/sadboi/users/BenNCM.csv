Challenge accepted! The time you are asking for is now. I believe in nothing. I am nothing. A big gaping empty void where there is nothing, but space.

You should have phrased your challenge differently. Maybe use the word 'anything' instead.

But I think you're mistaken. Not being able to believe doesn't mean that you now disbelieve at all. I don't know where you got that from. Disbelief is a refusal to believe or accept something. Boris has run out of belief in order to fuel his delusions. He hasn't started refusing to belief in his delusions. He'd like to believe in them, because if he did then he might lift the morale of the country a bit. But he can't. He just can't do it. He's been nullified.

Christianity,fmw5xd2,t3_fxk958,1586440243.0,"Nearly all of the negative things that you say are assumptions. They are NOT facts, because they have not happened yet. 

People should never make assumptions about their future simply because it feels like things will never change. The simple fact is that it is literally impossible for anything to stay the same. Things can only get worse or get better. It's your choice. Things remaining as they are forever isn't actually something that can happen, so forget about it.

Listen to your thoughts or go through your writings or trains of thought and highlight the facts and separate them from the assumptions. The things that can be said because they are true, and the things which will become true if you keep telling yourself they are already true when they aren't.

Dont ruin your life investing the power of your belief in assumptions which the end up becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. Never EVER declare that whatever negative experience is happening for you, will carry on like that forever, because you have no right to claim such a thing before it's actually takes place, and whether it places or not is entirely your choice."
