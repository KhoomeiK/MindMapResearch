However, I just finished ep 18, and I‚Äôm a pretty bummed out by the ‚Äúactually it was human trafficking‚Äù twist. As someone with bipolar disorder, the way DeLuca‚Äôs supposed mania kicked an idea into hyperdrive when he fixated on it and ending it with a screaming freak out is honestly uh...very real. 

And it meant a lot to see them go to that place with a character that‚Äôs so established in the world of the show!

As talented as Gabrus is, and as much as he purports to be a full-of-it smartass, like any good comedian (or you know, like any average person) he has a healthy amount of self-loathing so I think that plays a part in how he (and many other podcasters imho) perceive the people that not only listen, but care enough to comment.

And then the people that are dumb enough to think he's good and funny are actually being kinda mean sometimes? Were I in the same position, I would certainly have a somewhat skewed perception of r/earwolf posters. Plus there's LA cultural things that enhance that perception, and the fact all these podcasters grew up in the era where posting online was perceived as being for nerds and losers, it's a big melting pot of weird feelings. Plus, like with anyone it doesn't usually take more than one person being hurtful for it to wipe away the compliments and kinda ruin the day (confirming the self-loathing, obvi). And even here there's some spoilsport in the thread like 20-30% of the time.

But at the end of the day they're the ones compulsively checking this forum, so there's something they find appealing about their fans. Obviously though we're dumb, we're also very smart for liking them too. 

I think the problem is more it's not okay (or advisable, considering the potential to encourage bad actors) to just admit you a) read online comments people make about you and b) are negatively effected by it in a sometimes-profound way.

PennyDreadful,fqncy4g,t1_fqn90k1,1589492644.0,"Hey no worries, apologies for being strident--seems like you're trying to argue in good faith. 

While America does have a singular relationship with race, I would argue while the specifics are particular to America, the systemic oppression and imperialist roots being intertwined with ethnicity is far from unique. 

""I don't see color"" was a popular phrase that could be found in white liberal circles in the 90s, but has fallen out of fashion because that idea is itself biased oppression. We all see color, everyone in every country sees color (barring physical differences in interpreting and/or perceiving light, of course). 

Just because some countries don't categorize ethnicity on their census doesn't mean they don't have cultural histories and politics that have often to always been defined along lines of class, race, and gender. 

Any country with imperialist roots that involved racial categorization (hint: most of Europe and all the countries they colonized, which is most of the world) and still maintains a white ethnic majority has a governmental system rooted in and perpetuated by white supremacy. The connections are deeply rooted at times, but they are there nonetheless.

But for argument's sake, lets put aside any concerns about cultural appropriation or being ""politically correct"". The fact remains that the best art is tightly woven into the fabric of the human experience. When you are depicting a culture, you are depicting the end result of those experiences. 

If you don't really understand the experiences in the first place, you're not going to be able to put together the thousand little decisions that are made between idea and streamable content in a way that remains woven into an authentic reflection of the human experience. 

There are lots of things you can invent as a writer, but in television I think writing primarily from a cultural perspective that isn't one's own is almost impossible to do if you're hanging the entire show on it. You can't live two lives. Yes, Logan did a great job for the time in writing a feminist show in the first PD, but there were times it was clear a man was writing for women and I do think cultural mimicry is by far the most difficult. 

There are just way too many experiential touchstones to absorb to really get it unless you grew up around/enmeshed in the culture, and Logan clearly didn't. 

I would argue that's what's wrong with a lot of current tv--it's white guys writing from a bunch of different racial and gender perspectives and it works like 1% of the time. Just let white people write white shit and bring in actual latinx people to write a latinx show, etc. 

That's why Atlanta is so amazing--everyone in that room writing the show is black and everyone in the cast is black. That's why The Sopranos is amazing--David Chase grew up around mob guys and wrote basically his mom and family into the show. 

Too much time and energy is otherwise spent faking an entire world you know nothing about and it ends up lifeless and hollow. Just like this show!"

There are straight people, there are gay people. A chunk of those are raised in environments that breed hatred of gay people. Because of that hatred, there is a lot of incentive to not come out or acknowledge any sexual desire not completely heterosexual. It's statistically likely then that some people who are gay and live in those environments will be closeted and hate gay people. 

There are also plenty of straights in those environments that hate and kill gay people. But there is this cultural fetishization of the concept of gay men that hate themselves and that leads to this stereotype that anyone who really hates gays is themselves gay. That's just not the case, especially not in the 1930s."
PennyDreadful,fqmudye,t1_fqmn8nu,1589483687.0,"I will say I enjoy her performance as the scheming mayor's assistant, as it's Natalie Dormer just going for it and being completely committed to a specific oddness. When she's not burdened by the high-wire act of doing brownface in 2020 and John Logan can just write white people being weird and kinda evil, it starts to feel fun and interesting. She can just play around.

The rest is just god-awful. 

While you've confirmed to me the people who are really defending her performance are simply enamoured with her bc she's hot and overlooking that your go-to of Great Acting being James McAvoy is absolutely baffling, I will acknowledge Dormer definitely has a compelling charisma. The fact that her best work is when she's made up to be cinematically unattractive is a testament to her ability to do some good stuff.

But that's what I'm talking about really. Her self-consciousness of trying to be some latinx, old mexico spirit goddess/demon or a pachuco just kills the vibe and it all rings soooo false and lame. 

It's just the best and most encapsulating example of why this show doesn't work--a white man over 50 who grew up in Jersey writing a show about Latinx and Mexican culture and the struggles of living in the diaspora and living in America in the 30s as an ethnic minority, writing a character that is supposed to be emblematic of a rich spiritual and cultural history that spans centuries and continents for a white woman from England. 

I understand why she took the role but it was a mistake to do so. It was a mistake to cast her. It was a mistake for Logan to not spend a year in Mexico with brujas and filled his writer's room with latinx writers and figure out really what the fuck he was trying to write about, so Natalie Dormer could figure out really who tf she's trying to play. 

I understand why Logan did it as no one's making white penny dreadful part 2 in today's tv economy, but he didn't commit enough to what he was trying to do or respect the culture he was trying to portray enough to truthfully tell their stories, and as a result has produced an absolute failure for everyone involved.

So like yeah the old school shrink had his righteous moment, but he also helped absolutely no one with his treatment, so maybe he wasn‚Äôt really an example of right action but an example as to why therapy moved past moralizing judgments in favor of compassionate understanding.

Melfi isn‚Äôt the best psychiatrist, but I think perhaps The Sopranos could be more precisely characterized as simply accurately depicting the inherent limitations of psychological treatment. 

There was no therapist in the world that could have made Tony not be a piece of shit, but Melfi kept the guy from having panic attacks, maybe influenced him here and there to not be quite so shitty and helped pull him back from the brink more than a few times. Maybe that‚Äôs all that was ever gonna be possible w a guy like Tony

However, I don‚Äôt want to discredit the notion that Chase was critical. He certainly had a particular agitation with the academic elitism of the field and egotism of the practitioners, but like everything it was nuanced enough to say a lot of different things."

makinghiphop,fqkq9x9,t1_fqkpqai,1589433336.0,Yeah it‚Äôs tough! Try forcing yourself to make 16 or even 32 bar loops just to practice getting a feel for the ebb and flow and rhythm of phrasing for those bar lengths

PennyDreadful,fqkl5hb,t1_fqk6vw8,1589429763.0,"I really do think in this day and age her not being latinx is going to prevent her performance from ever ringing as authentic or truly compelling within the world of the show. Dormer isn't an idiot, she's aware of it and that's bleeding into her performance. A white man writing a white woman playing a variety of latinx characters, it's like all these refractions of the actual culture through white lenses so by the time the light hits us it looks all fucked up. 

Having the ability to write for an authentically latinx performer would make the writing better and the actor in the role could really lean into the aspects of latinx culture that could be exaggerated and passionately/informatively weave into the performance historical and cultural latinx touchstones. All that stuff not being there just makes everything feel really lifeless and thin"
PennyDreadful,fqkajxs,t1_fqk7115,1589423351.0,"Yeah I actually just finished rewatching the OG PD last week, and the difference is astonishing. The original was even better than I remembered (we were so spoiled then with great shows it felt like just another), and this is just a sad sad imitation"

PennyDreadful,fqk5fhh,t1_fqi71h2,1589420503.0,I really cannot wrap my head around the praise Dormer is getting on this sub. She's awful. Her being white is already starting way off on the wrong foot but I don't find her performances at all compelling. Not that this show isn't boring enough but her performances don't help
PennyDreadful,fqk54b7,t1_fqjuu54,1589420334.0,"Just wanna say I've basically agreed with all of your posts on this discussion, you've nailed why this show is such a disappointment. 

All John Logan had to do was fill his writer's room with a bunch of brujas, cast Penelope Cruz or a no name latinx actor in the Dormer role, and then actually lean into the premise of his own show. 

It's sad--it's so clear he doesn't understand the culture from whose perspective the show is understood. He's just engaging with exterior qualities but there's no ""lived-in"" feeling to anything happening in this show. It all rings really hollow."
makinghiphop,fqk2425,t1_fqizupz,1589418858.0,"I think it's important to keep in mind that, while it looks very complex, I would be willing to wager it was created on 16 pads of chops.

PennyDreadful,fqgnewj,t1_fqexvs1,1589351131.0,"idk... I think she's pretty dang bad to be honest. I would have loved to have seen what Penelope Cruz would have done with the role. 

Would have to rewrite the German storyline a little but come on. Dormer isn't getting great stuff to flesh out the characterizations, but her performances are really not bringing any sort of distinguishing traits to the characters she's playing. 

I think the lion's share of the blame for this failure lies on Logan's shoulders, but casting Dormer in this part was a massive misstep."

PennyDreadful,fqfynmn,t1_fq8xp1h,1589334324.0,"The half-Welsh, half-Danish Natalie Dormer saying ""I'm not really a spic, I'm a dago"" may have been the nail in the coffin for me here. The entire role would play so much better with a latinx actor, but really the problem is Showtime wants John Logan to write a bunch of racially interrogative dialogue and story and he fuckin sucks shit at it. 

I would have been super down for a Penny Dreadful sequel, but not forcing some dude obsessed with old dead white male poets and Mary Shelley to write some trenchant analogue for our racially trying times is just stupid. Let John Logan have people quote poetry for no reason and wear awesome frilly dresses and add some blood and call it a day, no one needs this.

What a waste of Nathan Lane. Hopefully this isn't the last I see of the lead though, I like his face"

trapproduction,fqfmiqm,t3_gimfgy,1589327589.0,"Bruh it‚Äôs an endless battle. Just gotta experiment, go through different phases of types of sounds you‚Äôre combining. It would be hard for people to give you more specifics considering anyone who would want to would need to look up their projects or have a mental Rolodex of great synth recipes. 

Just think about the qualities of a sound, the attack decay sustain and release. If you have a bell type sound with a lot of ping and attack, you might layer it with a softer pad to fill it out for example. FX is a whole other bag and you‚Äôll need to modulate your synth combinations accordingly.

Just keep getting loops together and layering them and trying new stuff and you‚Äôll get better"

I‚Äôve been trying to ‚Äúlearn piano‚Äù for like...10 years lol and I never get past the beginning so unless you‚Äôre serious about spending time every day/multiple times a week practicing then go for it. If you‚Äôre under 20, absolutely pursue it as hard as you can cuz you‚Äôll reap huge benefits from learning how to play.

If you‚Äôre over 25, forget it. You‚Äôre better off buying a 49, messing around but really working on chord theory by doing it in a DAW and working on melodies that way. 

A keyboard can be really helpful for finding the beginning chords for your loop though, so a 49 would be ideal for getting basic ideas down then fine tuning if that‚Äôs a workflow that appeals to you"
