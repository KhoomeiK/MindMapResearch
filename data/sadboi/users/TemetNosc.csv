I understand that it was an important part of the human development but it is no longer a need and therefore it is inmoral to keep doing it, considering the consequences it has on animals and the enviroment."

Super proud of you! 
After a couple weeks, I am finally feeling better about it. It is hard but some rl and reddit friends have made it a little easier.

It will be hard, but you have to let it go. 

The point of being in a relationship is enjoying it, is being better than alone, and when you accept that she cheated on you, and that you yelled at her, and after that you wish still being there then you are trappend in a codependency pattern. If you are not making each other happy then maybe you should not be together. I know it is hard to accept and we all have been so pushed by movies and songs about love, but they don't tell the truth. 

Don't ever let your happines and wellbeing be defined by someone else.

Now the hardest part will be to get to know yourself. Probably you will think that everything that you did was with her and you fill empty without her. That's normal in your situation. But you have to rediscover yourself, your passions, what you want to do, force yourself to know new people, spend time with family and friends, learn how to be healthy by yourself. Try new things, fail and then try other things, keep what feels great. Redefine yourself. You will make it!

Hugs bro! I know that I wrote all like shit but is the best that my english can do by now. 

You will be better.

Please feel free to talk to me whenever you want. You are not alone."

I love hugs but at the same time feel too shy to just hug my friends/closest ones.

Shen,f1ytf9n,t1_f1y6dph,1569824209.0,AFAIK The passive of Shojin activates when you autoattack after you used ult so you aren't wasting its effect. The thing is you have to know pretty well how to use Shen's abilities to not run out of energy and make it worth.

And the only way to top that would be winning the final against Brasil on their house, for the 2014 WC quarters (and well, every other WC that they eliminated us from lol)

Revenge is a dish best served fucking cold."
