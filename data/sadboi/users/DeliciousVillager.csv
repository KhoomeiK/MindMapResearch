BipolarReddit,fdi1acr,t3_eldhfz,1578433967.0,I was diagnosed bp2 last year which is also the year my 4th child was born. Im going to be honest it's hard very hard. I struggle a lot and haven't always been the best mother. If I would have known what I know about myself now I wouldn't have had 4 kids maybe one or none. If you are fairly stable I'd say go for it. If you're not and you're struggling I'd advise against it. I love my children with all of my heart but I know my mental illness stifles my abilities as a parent.
