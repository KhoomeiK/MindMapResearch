Is it knowing what choices to make at any given time? Is it being completely impartial to anything?

Even when the servers weren’t constantly going down or not running properly there just wasn’t a lot to do except a long and tedious grind. I left GTA:O until last year and yeah there’s balancing issues and there’s several phone calls that are pretty much spam but the fact there’s an absolute shit ton of actual unique content and servers are a hell of more stable makes the game so much better.

One thing that the other two modern Fallouts lacked that it didn’t is that everything fits together so well, when something happens it directly impacts what happens next. 

The actual story is more like the Courier did this and because of that this happened, then because of that, the Courier has to do this etc.

Fallout 3&4 stories are more like and then, and then, and then, because of this the vault dweller has to do this and then, and then etc."

Also aliens.

It’s massively in-depth and a lot of lore based videos and web pages available on the internet but there’s no real need for any to play any specific game, you’ll only ever get the lore in small first person fragments from terminals or audio logs and these accounts aren’t usually interested in recalling or documenting canon historical events they generally are (and understandably) recalling or describing the danger they are or was in or revealing something related to the current player’s story which for the most part had multiple ending and so isn’t canon."

FifaCareers,eqhw784,t1_eqgzg4n,1560072046.0,"I think they’re both equally bad. Contracts are dumb in Madden, you have to quit if you want a new coaching job and you could win the super bowl multiple times a team still might not pick you up, at which point it’s game over, you literally get 4 weeks, so dumb. 

Maddens actual gameplay is bad and requires so much tweaking with sliders to resemble something remotely possibly realistic. 

The scouting is bad. After a few years there’s a serious lack of depth in certain positions throughout the league unless you mess around with xp sliders too much. 

Regression is so bad, like on FIFA for the most part if a player is playing well even as he gets older he won’t become a pile of shit, in Madden it starts at 28 and they could be the MVP and still regress.

I could go on forever but the truth is both games are fucked and not nearly worth their ridiculous price tags."
