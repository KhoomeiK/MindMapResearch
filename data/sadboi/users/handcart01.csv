mentalhealth,flckhn5,t1_flck853,1585034469.0,Yeah that fits me pretty well. I have plenty of friends but that doesn't bring me much happiness or comfort. My brain tells me people don't care or that I'm a burden to them.

usmnt,fk6mi58,t1_fk692lk,1583907054.0,Colleges in the US are required to provide equal athletic scholarships to men and women. In most other countries I dont believe many women are provided with free schooling if they are good at soccer. Many schools including mine don't even have men's teams but do have women's teams in order to upset the massive amount of scholarships given to football players. There are many more reasons but that's some of the reason
ChoosingBeggars,fjjc3f2,t1_fjj6ln6,1583389893.0,So in basketball if you score with the ball going straight through the hoop its called a swoosh. Then people started saying splash like it went straight through it splashed. So if it splashes then its wet and now people use wet as regular slang
