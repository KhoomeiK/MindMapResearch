AmItheAsshole,fpq8na0,t1_fpq8dz7,1588817396.0,I'm just worried because maybe she truly just doesn't remember. Sometimes she says I did something and I legitimately don't remember. I don't know if she's doing it on purpose.

But I also might be a bit biased because I find Tom Hiddleston extraordinarily handsome."

AskReddit,epqnee8,t3_bv51tj,1559409002.0,"I have a couple.

One is my grandfather crying. A couple years ago, my great-grandmother died, I didn’t know her so well so I didn’t cry then. But at the funeral, I was walking back to my seat and I saw his eyes filled with tears, and I started sobbing. I have never seen him cry, and he very rarely shows his emotions, so that hit me like a truck.

Another one is kinda simple. It’s just a quote from Coldplay’s Paradise; “The sun must set to rise”. I sure hope it’s true.

This is the biggest one. I got hospitalized last year and my aunt came in to sit with me and my mother until the morning (when the psychiatrist came in). How I felt then was so terrible but confusing, I don’t know how to explain it. I was feeling everything but nothing at once. And I felt so embarrassed that my aunt knew about my problems, so usually when I’m feeling particularly depressed, I just remind myself how embarrassing it would be if I committed suicide and my entire family and all my friends would know."
