It was back in 70s i soviet Russia, my mom lived in a quiet little neighborhood and since those were safer times she used to walk or bike by herself to school and back. That was one particular day she was coming home earlier than usual so her parents weren't yet home from work. She was around 8/9 years old, not really aware of stranger danger and the concept of kidnapping and trafficking as she noticed a middle aged man walk behind her as she was approaching her apartment building. She went in and as a courtesy held the door for him since it seemed like he was going the same direction. He thanked her, walked in throught the door, looked around and grabbed her from behind dragging her away from the hallway. He was away stronger and she had no chance to break free so she started kicking and screaming. He put his hand on her mouth to shut her up and thats when my mom did the best thing possible, she bit his hand so hard that it started to bleed. He let out a scream and she managed to break free and run up the stairs to their neighbors apartment.
Years later she still has nightmares about that day."

AskReddit,f2jsvy7,t3_ddh8vm,1570277275.0,"Couple of years ago when I was around 13 y/o I was travelling around Italy with my family, thats how we usually spent every summer, we would pick a country and drive from city to city exploring the history and architecture.
This particular event took place in Rome. On our 3rd or 4th day there, after admiring all the famous sightseeings, churches, fountains, museums, a trip to vatican, we were having a slow ""walk-around"" evening when we reached a piazza, exhausted and craving some late night tiramisu. I was sitting down, chewing breadsticks and playing around with the camera, as I early in the trip gave myself the duty of photographing out adventures. My mom was burried in the travelers guide, reading out interesting facts about the places we've visited. As a 13 y/o the history didn't fascinate me too much so I wasn't paying too much attention to anything. The only thing I remeber my mom telling about that place was some woman being killed there centuries ago and later pronounced a saint.
As it was getting late I made sure to take some good pictures of my parents and my baby sister sitting across from me, we payed the check and headed back to the hotel.  We were doing our usual evening routine - my mom taking a long bath, me and sis watching Italian TV, not understanding a single word but still entertained, while by dad looked through the photos I took to sort out the good ones and transfer them to the map on his laptop. I remember my dad making weird noises, jumping up from the chair and knocking on the bathroom door erratically til my mom came out wondering what was going on. She walked up to the computer, stared at the screen for a couple of seconds and let out a silent scream. There was a group of pictures focused on my sister in front of her. In 3 of them you could see a light blue smoke-like shadow in a size of a grown woman behind her. In the first picture it was on the left side, on the second right behind my sister, facing the camera almost touching my sisters shoulder and the in the third it was passing her by and out of the shot.
Being a religious, catholic woman my mom found it a bad omen and made my dad delete all the pictures. Sometimes I can still see that shadow when I close my eyes."
