I'm a capitalist at heart but sadly unchecked capitalism is nearly as bad as communism since it always crashes an economy and turns it into a shithole for a while.

We have veterans that can't get to their chemo treatments but we also have people with 100 billion dollars.

The rich make the laws, and use the laws to their advantage.  Us poor and/or working class are basically dependent on being able to work enough hours to live comfortably while the smart or lucky people worry about the most efficient place to put their money so it can make more money.

I HIGHLY suggest you check out a book called Rich dad Poor Dad.  Read any books it recommends.  And continue to study personal finance and investing so you can work hard to free yourself from wageslavery.

It's not easy.  But it's worth it.  I've basically had 2 full time jobs for years just trying to get ahead.  I don't care about the money.  I just want to be free and able to walk still when i retire.

i got crippled up pretty bad and wound up with a 300s credit score.  I paid almost $1,000 to learn this and it works.  I don't know how and i don't care.

Sign up for Credit Karma.  They have the best advice to fix your credit and improve it.  They shill a lot of loans and cards so be aware.  You can also check your score but they email you monthly so i just check it then.  

You can pay to have unsecured credit cards if need be.  Paid another $2,000 for a fistful of them so i could rebuild.

ONLY use the cards for normal stuff like gas and groceries and ALWAYS have the funds to cover it.  It's not a piggy bank or an emergency card!  It's basically a debit card you use and pay later rather than the other way around.  It's a credit building tool and nothing more.

Stay UNDER 30% of the maximum balance allowed on the card ALWAYS.  I'm currently over on 2 and it's not hurting anything.  But it's not helping.  The oven went out and my wife cooks a lot.  She was eyeballing a nicer one and breaking our own rules we got it and are now suffering the consequences.  As small as they may be.

Get about 4-6 cards.  Use one 1 month.  Then switch to another card the next.  When the bill for the first card comes make the minimum payment.  When the second bill comes for that card.  Pay it off.

Many cards have 0%apr for the first year so use those.

Keep the 2 oldest cards you have no matter how shitty because length of credit history is important and should something happen to one you have a backup.  Buy lunch once a month with them or something and just eat the annual fee.

When you hit 850 credit score it is time to buy a house.  Rather you live in it or not you can use it as another credit building tool that i don't even know enough to give advice about here.  But trust me.  You get to 850 join a real estate investing club or get on biggerpockets.

Then a few hours later my dad brought up a good point that we have a lot of random logs getting drug down the river and landing on a full grown alligator snapping turtle could kill you.  

I don't know how high of a jump it was but I've never experienced anything like it.  When you hear wind whistling past your ears you know whatever you just did was probably a bad idea."
AskReddit,fqnk93s,t3_gjn5vc,1589496357.0,"I'm not sure if it is common at all but my dad says it a lot.  90% of the time after watching me struggle and cuss for 10 minutes and then just doing it himself in 10 seconds.  Dude is a self taught mechanic and probably the best I've ever met.  Pisses me off because I know the second he says ""Let me show you something i learned in Okinawa"" i know he's about to just solve it.

Until I was 15 years old i thought Okinawa was just some town or trade school in Kansas or Missouri.  Then one day i found out it's in Japan.  I asked my dad if he'd ever been there.  ""No.  Why?""  I got so pissed i just left.  I'm 34 years old and to this day anything mechanical i try and argue with my father he is probably right 99% of the time.

I'm as proud of it as i am embarrassed that i can't even rip plug wires off a chevy without doing it one at a time or consulting Google."

Blew out a few fingers wrenching roads.  (Oil well repair.  Basically snap 2 big wrenches towards you and if you miss it's a blown finger tip normally.

Was building a church and one of the trusses came off the talehandler somehow.  I took off running in 2x4s and missed a step.  Fell about 8 feet and managed to shatter my heal and ankle.  It was so messed up they couldn't even put a cast on it.  Laid around on my mother-in-law's couch for over a year crutching into job interviews and trying every work from home scan imaginable while my wife worked two jobs.  That was about 10 years ago and we just finished paying off 6 figure medical debt and getting our credit near 700 again.  Late fees and penalties add up when you just stop paying them.

A fun one where neither of us got a scratch though.  I didn't realise they'd sprayed the roads to melt the ice.  Turned onto one that wasn't sprayed and was booking it in a little mazda pickup when we started sliding.  Wound up in the only straight up and down rocky ravine around and i leaned over panicking and did the ""soccer mom arm grab"" trying to save my wife somehow.  Rolled a little and at the exact same time i leaned over a tree shoved the corner of the cab into the back window.

I don't know if my guardian angel is really really good or just gave it up but hopefully that's the end of me getting hurt and crashing shit."

Last month i decided for some reason to visit 4 chan for the first time in a decade.  Some poor bastard was asking for $3 for ramen noodles or canned goods to last a few days.  It could be a scam obviously but 3 bucks?

I wound up buying him and a few of his friends a few pizzas delivered and couldn't tip the delivery guy so i then ordered a couple more and told them it was a tip for the delivery bro.  Make him wtf ever pizzas he wants or if applicable give him the cash.  If neither is okay email me a way to flip him 15 bucks for the hassle.

I kinda feel bad bragging about it but it made my day and i like to think those guys will remember it also.

I was just going to spend the 50 bucks on beer anyway.  Instead i had a picnic with the wife and rented a few movies.  I had more fun anyway.
