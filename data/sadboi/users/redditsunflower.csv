AskReddit,fpbfw3t,t1_fpbcsb5,1588469066.0,"You're making an attempt in healing yourself. The meds maybe not be a forever thing. There's no shame in helping yourself to recover. You're doing great by helping yourself recover. Ppl around me was discouraging me from taking meds too. But I still do it, with doc's advise ofc. I was unable to function at all before the meds. A year and a half later, I'm finally much better and doc said i dont need the meds anymore. Im doing much better now in fact. So pls just do whatever you need to recover. No shame in that. 💪"
ptsd,fo5koh0,t3_g5pdlo,1587528016.0,"Hey ya! Thank you for your post i feel less alone. I'm on my journey to recovery. I've stopped taking medicine for almost two months now (on the advise of my doc and counsellors). They believed I've made a lot of progression since i've been diagnosed (from last year). However, I still fall back into relapse sometimes for the past few weeks due to lockdown in my country.  I feel stucked at home. But i'm glad I'm in a much better mental space than last year.  My victory today will just be fully feeling myself and being peaceful :D to the rest of y'all, pls do take care of yourselves. We'll get thru this together <3"

AskReddit,fn52ywc,t3_fz1tvr,1586654685.0,"Was walking back to train station after class. I wore a skirt one inch above my knee. When i passed a group of older men, they started cat calling and said things like follow us we'll have money to buy cloth for you. They attempt to  get closer and wanted to hold me, I ran like hell. Btw, its daylight at 4pm in public. I was safe but when i told this to my male friend, he looked at me and asked 'Why are you walking ALONE and wearing skirt?' i just gave up. He's a nice guy generally. But this really sucks. :("

malaysia,fk6rjxf,t1_fk6l25n,1583913034.0,"Hey, the gov hospital has psychiatric department. What you need to do is:
1. Go any klinik kesihatan nearby you
2. Tell the doctor what problems you're having your depression thoughts etc and how often.
3.they'll write a letter for you to any gov hospital or private ones if you prefer. 

And for your panic attacks in the mean time, you may find these two methods useful:
1. Deep breathing 
2. Progressive muscle relaxation. Basically deep breathing and focus on a certain group of muscles (contract then release as you deep breathing), then proceed to other group of muscles from head to toe.

Take care buddy"

 All I know is that I'm building on myself rn. A better person with more beautiful and happy memories. Looking forward to creating more memories with friends and family."

toastme,eoi1chj,t3_brrhwh,1558607035.0,"Your sadness and depression is valid. But no,it's not destroying you. You're choosing to heal and fight back the depression in whatever manner you can. Keep trying alright. 

 You can think of Ptsd and depression like waves. They will keep coming and coming. You cant stop them,but you can learn to cope with them and surf thru the waves. So when you fall off the surfboard,its okay,you can climb back up again. Take your time and be gentle with yourself.

 And you have two fuzzball and a caring boyfriend that cares for your wellbeing. You're cherished and loved! And an amazing young woman who still fights back each day. Remember,you're a survivor. Lastly, You go girl!!"
AskReddit,eoi0j53,t3_brzuwa,1558606149.0,"Saying things like 'just don't think about it' won't cure away our depression. Just because we're better and dont talk about it, doesn't mean it's not there. We're constantly struggling and trying our best. Like trying really,really hard. Even when we feel numb and barely remember to take care of ourselves, we still struggle to work/school. Just showing up itself is going thru' an uphill battle."
