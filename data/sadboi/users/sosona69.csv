BipolarReddit,fjbx0m8,t3_fc7s5m,1583203299.0,"Ah, the story of my life! Literally always happened to me. All my friends are all gone now except for 2 a very persistent one, which i'm very grateful for. Everytime I ""dissapeared"", they'll be constantly contacting me eventhough I just closed off all communications. Sometimes even I have this thought that they'll be sick of me soon, bcs I know if I were them i'll be sick of my attitudes too."

depressed,fj0stuf,t3_fatb3m,1582907027.0,"It's okay, everything will get better. It will all pass. It will always pass. This hurt, this pain, that you feel today will be completely gone, that is a fact. Because life is constant, it always goes on. It might leave some memories, but these feelings of hurts and grieves are temporary. As long as you will it, one day you will look back to this day and say I'm proud of myself for going through this hardship. I'm proud of myself for being strong.

Imagine this, it might seem weird but put yourself in the perspective of a particle of dust that's floating in a ring of Saturn. So far away from Earth that it's just viewing these tiny human lives like ours as insignificant. How huge this universe is compared to our lives is speaking to ourselves that life is more than just our problems, our hurts, our pains. Life is much more than that.

Sure you might hurt now, it's alright. You can grieve. That's makes you human. Take your time.

But remember, this pain will be gone. This grieve will be over. It will soon be okay, I'm sure of it.

What you need to do now is don't forget to take care of yourself first. Starting from small things is the best. Make sure you get out of the bed, taking shower, having some meals, drink some water & don't let yourself get dehydrated, get out & get some fresh air if you can, let the nature heals you. Your wellbeing is most important thing right now. Pay attention to that.

In the end, everything will absolutely be alright."
depression,fj0lccz,t3_farc3n,1582902586.0,"Same, you're not alone.

I sometimes also have this constant thoughts of wanting to die, extremely frequent, nagging at me, and just oh so so alluring.

Make me to just wanna left behind everything and not dealing with anything & simply just give up.

I'm alive but just not living.

Mind you I have bipolar, so this whole suicide thought stuff when i'm in depresses mood are like recurrent themes in my life. But despite that, until now I still trying to find out how to deal with it too, and it's still hard every time.

I also know that i need help. But I'm also the kind of person that's reluctant to spoke up to people about it bcs I tend to isolate myself when I'm depressed.

Yet, inside, I screamed for help. Perhaps the reason is that I still can't really let go of this life, regardless of how shit it is.

Writing this comment actually make me realizing that I extremely want some help, thank you. And while I write this comment I also downloaded some random ebooks on library genesis about suicide prevention. Maybe I'd get some tips & tricks out of it, idk. Self help books sometimes help, sometimes don't. Maybe you should read those book too, if you want. Who knows maybe it'd works for you."

Tapi kalo emang mendesak banget, pastiin diri sendiri sehat dulu & make sure protections available all the time on you like masks. & kalo agendanya menyangkut pergi ke crowded places ky konser, tunda dulu aja deh."
depression,fizh6a6,t3_fajhs4,1582862717.0,"Been hiatus from Instagram for a year and a month now. Just occasionally checking for 2 or 3 times just out of curiosity.

It's just horrible thing really, I keep comparing myself with others & feel jealous about other's oh so great life that they portrayed all the time on the Instagram.

&#x200B;

But it's pretty okay now, I'm much more focused in my life. I don't really care about what happen with people bcs I literally don't know what's going on with their life. The less you know the less it bothers you. So when I meet them irl later and have some chat. They said ""How could u not know?"", and I was like "" Gurl, how am I supposed to know? Tell me more about it""

And then conversation happens.

Turns out the real life doesn't really appeared as great as what appeared on those post. And I much preferred catching up with my friend's life over face to face conversations rather than from an illusions of life like that, thank you."
bipolar,fizdapp,t3_fallle,1582859943.0,"Gosh, I wish I was that happy when I got my first diagnosis. Back then I was having a horrible depression episode for weeks bcs of that. Tho it was relieving to finally has a set of fixed name for it.

Anyway, congratulation :)"
bipolar2,fizbzka,t3_faeqkt,1582859029.0,"It's understandable.

Most of the time bipolar people has a set of garbled and unorganized mind, so I was told. That's why explaining & describing things are actually quite a challenge. 

Like for example I do find my speech pattern are all over the place. So when I talk people, they need to be patient bcs it took me some time to deliver my words.

&#x200B;

So maybe write it down for the symptoms first, by then you can list it in a set of points so that you can at least organized it in a way that would help you.

&#x200B;

And ask people who are close to you like family or SO about some symptoms that they found on you. Bcs sometimes other people see things that we don't even noticed by our selves."
BipolarReddit,fiz9qdg,t3_faikqf,1582857475.0,"Yep.

And everybody's reaction when I had my meds was like ""you take those everyday?"". And I was like "" yeah, every single effin day"". And they had this look of pity /disgust/ horrified.

And then asked ""Does it work? Do you really need it?"". And my answer would always be ""heck if I know"""
