Divorce,fqkta6q,t3_gfdo9p,1589435663.0,"It helps to punch something a few times. Or many times. I sincerely with all my heart hope everything goes in your favorite and I’ll be keeping you and your boys in my thoughts and prayers. While I do not pity your wife, I genuinely hope she has a change of heart and makes things easier for you in the divorce. Best of luck to you❤️"
adultery,fqks6d4,t3_gj4ry3,1589434784.0,"This is a tough situation.. on one hand you’d like to continue being supportive to your spouse who needs support, but on the other hand you’re not getting what you need/ want from the relationship. Sometimes in a partnership one person falls behind and needs an extra push from their partner, and then after some time the roles may switch and so on. Do you feel like this is something they’ll be able to move on from? Is your partner someone who makes efforts to heal from their anxiety, depression? Someone who has taken efforts in the past to better themselves and strive to be their best self, but is just going through a rough patch now? Or have they always and overly rely on others and maybe not taken the necessary steps to heal? If you believe they can come back from this and and become a supportive, independent parter, then stay strong and faithful to them. You never know if down the line you’ll be in their position and need their love, understanding, and support like they needs yours now. But if you believe that this is the way your partner inherently is, codependent, self pitying, never attempts to better themself, then you I suggest maybe reconsidering what you want/ need out of a relationship and decide if this person can provide you what you look for or not. And then decide if divorce is reasonable for your situation, or if you’d want to find an AP who can provide you with what you need. I really hope things work out for you. Sometimes, when I’m struggling with something, I dont do anything about it and ask the stars for guidance, leaving it up to them. Usually, the answer pops up when I least expect it, in a way I least expect it."

You don’t own her or her decisions or her decorating style, you’re in a partnership with her and you gotta put aside your own preferences sometimes. I don’t blame her for not talking to you and if she decides to continue dating you, don’t abuse of her love for you by continuing to try to control her."

All the good stuff will come. 19F here, and can vouch for the fact that women will be attracted into your life once you are content with yourself and are confident in your abilities. It takes time to get there but it is beyond worth it. 
Totally agree with OP about lifting, meditating, petting a cat, instruments etc. I did all those things and it has gradually lifted me out of depression, and I find that the more content I am with myself and where I’m at, the better I get everyday. 
You cannot put off healing yourself by distracting yourself with low vibrational women/ activities/ distractions. Take the time to truly work on your development and happiness and better times will come.
Much love and healing to you guys ❤️"

I know it’s so so so hard to change your life, you’ve never known what’s it like to be in a functional environment.

Motivational videos are probably the main reason to why I’m so dedicated to living my best life. Try re directing all that energy form when your brain is going 10000 mph into something else, like your work, exercise, art, etc. Please if you need someone to talk to, message me!
