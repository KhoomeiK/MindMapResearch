I imagine they’d funnel all available funds into keeping Rivertown and North open, as well as Studio Park seeing as it’s their most recent endeavor.

The cinema experience does seem to be in even more jeopardy than before this virus, but maybe the closing of so many locations and businesses will open other doors going forward?"

relationships,fo2twe4,t3_g5dd3f,1587473980.0,"There have been a few comments stating to just ignore people who say stuff, or that you should just stop caring. While this answer isn’t necessarily wrong, it’s a dumb answer that’s reminiscent of telling a person with depression to just try being happy. 

Someday you will have gone through enough life experience to just “not give a shit.” Maybe. But until then you need to listen to people that will give you constructive feedback on concrete things you can actually do in an effort to ignore/not care about these comments, or how to respond to the people that make them.

I don’t have much to add, but there have been some good suggestions here. Answer with your own question. Point out that they’re being rude and judgmental with no basis for their prejudice other than appearance. Tell them you’re both teenagers and knew each other before puberty (if it’s true, great but if not... maybe try it out anyways?).

Just make sure to always maintain your composure and keep a level head and tone of voice. The more you explore ways to respond (or not respond) the more experienced you’ll become."

I have seen the originals more than any of the other films, but I still find myself able to enjoy the prequels. They’re cheesy and over dramatic action filled stories, and I fucking love that unabashedly. There are days when I can’t stand to sit through them, but they are the films that were new when I was young and impressionable, so they are objectively bad in many ways but, like, I still enjoy sitting down and watching them every time. 

The originals are good and just real special,  but the prequels are honestly how I think George really envisioned the films when he first made wrote them. 

The sequels are a joke."

I try to be reassuring after, but it’s something that has gotten harder and harder the more times this has happened. It almost feels like I’m trying to help a child learn a lesson but no matter how many times they make the same mistake they never learn what lead to that point. 

Support is definitely needed. I’m in therapy and have been for about a year and a half, but besides my therapist I can’t really talk to anyone about this stuff.

To some extent I think it’s natural to be psychologically affected by the problems and troubles those close to you are going through, but if it affects you this badly it probably is a manifestation of codependency, isn’t it..

suspiciouslyspecific,fktruw3,t1_fkrefzj,1584532554.0,"It doesn’t originate from The Office, but it is a quote. 

Just as a clarification, because the upvotes above seem to suggest a lot of people don’t really understand what the phrase: you don’t necessarily have to be exposing them through your pants. For example, your local seniors in the neighborhood Y locker rooms walking about with no clothes or towel on, their sack hanging low and swinging like the pendulum in your nan’s grandfather clock, are technically hanging brain. The etymological source of the phrase stems from the resemblance of the scrotum to the wrinkles on the grey matter of a brain. 

So, if that freshman in the dorm across the hall says he found some chewed up gum on the couch and wants you to come see, he’s not hanging brain as his testicles are not exposed, just his scrotum. However, if you walk in and his balls are rested lonely on his lap through his fly, or he’s stood erect with his pants down exposing the complete works, in both instances he is considered to be “hanging brain.”"
