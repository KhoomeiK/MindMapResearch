unpopularopinion,foa9bvu,t3_g6hhjc,1587642516.0,"There is definitely a sneaky societal pressure to have partners all the way through high school, even some in middle school in some cases. For some it’s good experience learning how to deal with a relationship and get some mistakes out of the way early, but for others it can be damaging. 

I think that if someone wants to just keep things casual and not get into anything committed when they’re younger, hell even older, then that’s totally fine. Nobody’s obligated to settle down if that’s not their style. But making a culture out of it and boasting about it is not the way to go. Same thing with people who enjoy being tied down, I’m one of them. I’ve been dating my current boyfriend for almost two years now (yay!) and the long distance is hard but I want to make it work because my dumb heart loves too hard. And that’s just the way I am. But I’d never go and brag about how my way of living is the best way and there’s an inferiority around any other way.

It can be difficult when those around you are all pushing the same culture though. Just like someone more rebelliously minded living in a super religious “marry your high school sweetheart and have kids at 20” kind of area.
