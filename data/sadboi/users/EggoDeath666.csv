ChronicPain,fr0gaef,t1_fr01743,1589794596.0,Thank you. I've been very worried because the pain seems to be getting worse instead of better and can hardly sleep at night. It's been hard not to catastrophize and think I'm developing fibro or MS.
Anxiety,fqvat0b,t3_gkttro,1589673353.0,"Omg yes I get aches in my upper abs all the time, it feels like I really strained something there but I haven't at all."
HealthAnxiety,fqv524n,t3_gklsi6,1589670019.0,"Lol I've been having the same fibro-related anxiety, it's so scary to think about the possibility of having chronic pain for the rest of your life. I am mostly fine and my pain is not severe but I get weird aches and pains that make me lose sleep and feel uncomfortable during the day. It's giving me the worst anxiety I've ever had in my life. I have no fatigue, weakness, or tenderness which is reassuring. You are probably fine if your symptoms are not severe or debilitating, and if they come and go."
HealthAnxiety,fqv4gzd,t3_gkou0l,1589669688.0,Probably just a pinched nerve or muscle tension. See a doctor so they can do a physical on you.
HealthAnxiety,fqtdnrl,t3_gksumt,1589636826.0,"Yeah, this is actually super common, I do this too. It's mostly due to stress/anxiety and it's nothing serious. It could also be posture related since a bad posture can cause shallow breathing."
HealthAnxiety,fqt82p3,t1_fqs4znx,1589632766.0,It honestly depends on the extent of the pain. If it's severe and/or persistent then it's worth getting checked out but that does not mean it's anything dangerous.
HealthAnxiety,fqs1v1v,t3_gkgpxw,1589596664.0,"Your health anxiety is 100% warranted. And you're completely right, you can't make pain up. Pain is pain. Whether it's anxiety or not it needs to be addressed. Definitely get all the tests you can, although it's probably something benign."
HealthAnxiety,fqs07qm,t3_gklggc,1589595675.0,"Yes this statement is true. Tumors cause intense symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, and extreme weakness. The headache would be excruciating and would not go away."
HealthAnxiety,fqkfq3i,t3_giv8eg,1589426325.0,"Holy fuck yes, never was a problem before but now I can't fucking handle it anymore. My skin is always prickly and I get random pains that hardly even hurt but I start catastrophizing and start to feel even more pain"
AskDocs,fqkeznd,t3_gins1l,1589425891.0,"Hey NAD but this is 100% normal, everyone gets this. But on a scale from 1-10 how bad is it? How bad is your chronic pain?"
HealthAnxiety,fq64ti4,t3_ggdcec,1589124509.0,Definitely see a neurologist and get some MRIs done. It's probably not MS but it's definitely something that should be checked out ASAP if it's bothering you. I get similar symptoms and I'm going to be seeing a neurologist soon.
Anxiety,fq3eipn,t1_fq2n6wa,1589065654.0,Sure!
AvPD,fpzlg45,t3_ggbwl0,1589019847.0,"Yes of course you should move out as soon as you are able to. And if you decide to never contact her again, that's entirely your choice. Spending too much time with emotionally abusive parents can worsen your mental health and you shouldn't feel obligated to stay."
AskDocs,fpymgxm,t3_gfqz84,1589006306.0,Have you discussed this with a doctor? NAD but it sounds like it's just muscle tension that could be fixed by some yoga and daily exercise.
Anxiety,fpx5taj,t1_fpx4afs,1588976216.0,"Honestly not much. Going on long walks helps, especially being in nature. But it's been scary lately because of covid anxiety and I still get the same symptoms just not as severe as they are at home.  I'm not on any meds but I take magnesium and L-theanine for stress and tension, and I take melatonin for sleep. They don't really do much at all though."
Anxiety,fpvczs8,t1_fpvcmra,1588941920.0,"it was a hybrid, but honestly all weed makes me anxious no matter what. I used to be a heavy smoker but I started cutting down when I noticed it did nothing for me."
HealthAnxiety,fpv5yyf,t1_fpuv9tq,1588936055.0,"Thanks, it does help a lot to know I'm not alone. But it's just been happening all the time. I know I'm extremely stressed but I've never had this happen to me and it's just getting worse."
Fibromyalgia,fppxlij,t3_gelovy,1588811122.0,"Have you heard of kratom? It’s a plant that has opioid properties, but is much safer. Many people with Fibromyalgia report that it reduces their pain significantly and increases energy. It’s available online but isn’t legal in every state."
AvPD,fpdpwls,t3_gcn0f5,1588531850.0,"I used to nearly every day, but it made me feel blurry and confused in the long run so I stopped. Now whenever I try and smoke weed it gives me the worst panic attacks and I start having scary thoughts and question my own existence. So I mostly avoid it, but I wish I could smoke sometimes. Having something to fall back on would be nice."
Anxiety,fp7odpx,t3_gbnjuv,1588374494.0,"Tbh not really. I’ve been suffering a lot since quarantine happened. I’m more worried about how long it will take for things to go back to normal, or if they will at all."
posturepals,fp1hjlm,t3_gaqddb,1588235750.0,"Talk to a doctor and go to physical therapy when the virus is over. Your situation sounds pretty severe so you need to get professional help, along with yoga. Maybe try finding some yoga exercises that are specific to the spine."
trees,fp0v1ud,t3_gafxd9,1588217565.0,This is exactly why I stopped smoking weed
HealthAnxiety,fowo1b1,t3_g9yxjt,1588123608.0,"L-theanine helps ease anxiety, but it doesn’t work that well in severe cases. If I’m feeling stressed or a little anxious L-theanine works very fast and helps me go back to normal."
TrueOffMyChest,fotrr0s,t3_g9hga4,1588063782.0,"Hey I know how you feel. I’ve always been severely depressed and anxious. I avoided pretty much all situations that weren’t in my comfort zone and as a result I’ve gotten pretty much nowhere with my life. Every time I had to try really hard, I gave up. Psychedelics have been a good way to reflect on myself and my decisions, and most importantly find motivation.

Remember, it’s the mental illness, it’s not you. Try separating who you truly are/want to be from what your mental illness says you are. Once you do that anything is possible, but you have to try. And don’t identify with those negative thoughts.
They will always bring you down and make you stuck."
Drugs,foot30m,t3_g8n13u,1587945875.0,"Have you considered seeing a doctor and/or a therapist? I think it could help you a lot. Brain damage isn’t necessarily irreversible, significant improvements can be made with some outside help."
ShroomID,fonmooq,t1_foni5lr,1587922430.0,This is correct. Fomitopsis pinicola.
Meditation,fnwmlqc,t3_g40a7y,1587321276.0,"Hi, I get this too and I believe it’s from having very tense muscles. I get it in my neck and my back. No matter what position I’d get into while meditating, my back and neck pop and grind like crazy. 

What has helped me is daily exercise with yoga and running. These help loosen up my muscles and giving me a general sense of well being. After I have done those things I am able to meditate without much tension."
thesopranos,fnwd7ox,t1_fnwbic9,1587316145.0,"What? Where’d you get that? Sociopathy is ASPD, not BPD."
AskDocs,fn1klue,t3_fwg39n,1586564012.0,"Hi I’m not a doctor but I’ve had all these symptoms as well and I also have bad health anxiety/general anxiety. I get aches in my neck, back, and chest. I’d also get chills and hot flashes. Anxiety can manifest itself in some really weird ways and cause aches and pains in different parts of the body. Of course, I would see a doctor when everything clears up and try and get an MRI just to be safe. But its probably just anxiety. 

For me, yoga, meditation, and exercise have helped a lot during this quarantine. I rarely get the pains I did and am in a slightly more peaceful state of mind. You’re gonna be ok!"
NoStupidQuestions,fmvek1y,t1_fmvdkl8,1586414278.0,Wow alright lol. I never insisted I was right and I never said the person responding was wrong.
NoStupidQuestions,fmtsf7x,t1_fmtriw0,1586378199.0,Ok dude I never said I disagreed with you.  I already know this and am a big proponent of psychedelics. OP asked if they take you to other dimensions and I said no. Get off your high horse and stop arguing with random people over the internet
NoStupidQuestions,fmtnpuj,t1_fmrw62a,1586375878.0,I didn’t say that they can’t. But they don’t take you to other dimensions or outer space or whatever. They are still drugs no matter how helpful and profound they may be.
NoStupidQuestions,fmrm6ik,t3_fwz4u4,1586327557.0,No they’re just drugs lol
AskDocs,fmn2egy,t3_fdp4v1,1586216773.0,"Hey I am no doctor but I’m also pretty young and have this. I have really bad posture and anxiety which I think is the reason this is happening. I’m doing yoga and running now which is helping a bit. Also, once things calm down, I’d suggest seeing a physical therapist."
ShroomID,fmj52ew,t3_fvh711,1586123185.0,Can you post more pictures? From this pic it doesn’t look like a mushroom at all
medical_advice,flxukz2,t3_fruvjr,1585590113.0,"Yeah. Get a Q-tip, put some hydrogen peroxide on there, and let it drip into your ear while tilting your head. Keep tilting for a few minutes. Then tilt your head the other way so it drains out. This should work and if not you’d have to go to a doctor so they can check it out."

I understood what you meant, I just wanted to say that shrooms don’t really have much potential for addiction even if one does have an addictive personality. Obviously choosing not to partake is a very personal choice and I get that, it’s just unlikely they will do much worse than change your perspective. But they still might not be for everyone."
entp,flr11ve,t1_flq1x7a,1585410716.0,Shrooms are not addictive at all. Psychedelics drugs are generally not addictive. They’re actually known to help combat addictions. Do some research
SuicideWatch,flmpgu6,t3_fpqa4k,1585291364.0,"Shrooms are widely known to have antidepressant effects. LSD not so much but it still also works for some people. I’d say do some research and take a small dose for your first time or consider microdosing on a regular basis. Either way, if you’ve tried other options, psychedelics may be a good last resort, you just have to play it safe.

Btw, 150ug is NOT by any means a microdose. That is a full dose and slightly more than is recommended for a first timer. A microdose is 1/10-1/20 a full dose."
microdosing,flkzo8g,t1_flfnbhg,1585250824.0,"You can check out r/sporetraders and http://sporeworks.com/Psilocybe-cubensis-Spore-Syringes. You would not grow them on manure. They just need a grain-based substrate to grow from. Look up PFtek and follow the instructions.

As for finding them in nature, you’d have to know what you’re looking for. Do some research about what the psilocybin mushrooms in your area are, and where/when they grow. 

Dosages would range from .03-.20. You’d have to experiment to figure out what works for you."

microdosing,fl66v54,t3_fma6ow,1584856434.0,"Seems like none of the people commenting have much experience with anxiety. Microdosing shrooms can definitely help ease your mind and develop new ways of thinking, you just have to put the work in.

However they are hard to find. If they are legal in your area (Oakland & Denver) then you can find them in a dispensary. Otherwise you just need to know the right people and ask around. Your other option would be to grow them yourself, spores are available online."
AvPD,fktd7eg,t3_fkd6hb,1584514711.0,"Im one out of 3 people left at my job at a Target Starbucks, everyone else is on LOA. I dont want to leave because I’m afraid of staying home. This job has helped me get out of my comfort zone a little, and I enjoy the different situations I encounter at work. I know when I am home I become very suicidal and sluggish, and do absolutely nothing productive or beneficial to my mental health. All I do is lay in bed and scroll my phone and hate myself.

So naturally I’d like to go to work every day than suffer at home. But I’m still considering taking leave because it’s not worth putting myself and the people around me in danger."

astrobrite is a 90s shoegaze band, some of the most fuzzy and dreamy music I’ve ever heard, if you’re into that.

Cortex is pretty similar to Stereolab, although they’re more jazz-funk. 

Lush and Lilys are two more really good shoegaze bands.

Tom Tom Club is a really fun band to dance to. 

Check out the Roches, they’re a trio and make really beautiful harmonies. 

The Silver Apples are a very strange and surreal band that started making electronic music in the 60s. 

Also: The Pastels, Connan Mockasin, The Durutti Column, Haruomi Hosono, Suicide, Fishmans, Roberto Musci, Strawberry Switchblade, Yo La Tengo :D"

Lots of my coworkers are on leave because they’re students and got kicked off campus and have to go home. Other people are just deciding not to come to work. So now we’re grossly understaffed and I have to close by myself tomorrow which I’ve never done as a 2 month old green bean.

starbucksbaristas,fjxpr4g,t3_ffdhv4,1583680395.0,"It does get a lot better after a couple months. During my first month I thought I’d never learn, and I’d feel terribly anxious during and after a busy shift. I’d have really bad back and neck pain as well. Then I started to build up confidence rather quickly after studying the drinks at home and just getting more practice. The pains went away as well. You will be fine as long as you put the effort in, and your coworkers will warm up to you too.

However, Starbucks is pretty high-stress regardless of your experience. So if after a few more weeks you still feel this bad, you might want to look at somewhere else to work. I wouldn’t risk my mental and physical health for this job."

I’ve struggled for as long as I can remember to find the truth of it all. How are things supposed to feel? What is right and what is wrong? What do I say?
