I am trying to get to work quick and my window is just fog or ice. I can scrape it, but you know sometimes it just builds up again quickly. I have heard there’s some kind of little heater I can acquire to plug into the power source and it will warm it up, but I have yet to figure out what it’s called and where I can purchase one.

So far since I switched to a gas station the does the fuel change (I noticed the dates it says #1 or #2 and when they run this fuel) it starts way easier. I’ve also learned to let my glow plugs fully cycle before I start, which has become a hassle free routine. I turn it on so it’s singing while I put on my seatbelt and get situated and by the time I’m ready to go she fires right up with no issues as of lately.

Fueling my car is the #1 source of anxiety for me lately. It sounds so stupid, but there’s so many diesel options at the gas station closest to me (have two in a tiny tiny town not many choices), and I’m so afraid I am going to mess it up somehow. The dealer told me “just make sure it isn’t pink & if it’s pink your car is fine still they’ll just fine you”. And the fining doesn’t scare me. I’m just SO afraid I’m somehow gonna mess it up. I haven’t accidentally almost put gasoline in it, it reminds me 700 times just taking off the fuel cap... it’s just something I’m not used to and I’m sure once I do it a few times it’ll become normal to me. I know I was the same way when I started refueling my gasoline vehicles at 16.. I actually accidentally put E85 in my Dads Impala when I was 17 and in a hurry to get to dinner before prom. Thank god they’re set up for it to  work in it (and my dad is a mechanic so he can fix it regardless), but he was still upset and didn’t want it ran through his engine ever. He says it’s the McDonalds value meal equivalent of fuel for your engine... whatever.. he’s so “American muscle over everything” that I often don’t follow his words of wisdom unless it’s Subjective in nature... back on topic.... You get what I mean right? That little voice in my head” oh no what if that was the wrong diesel, it looked fine.. but kinda weird, but oh no it says OTR wtf is that & it has different wording I don’t understand what if that was wrong” Sorry rambling on. I have owned the car since around the middle of August, I have only had to refuel it like 3 times because it gets such excellent mileage. So it’s still new to me. I also am going to invest in a pair of gloves that I’ll keep in my car for refueling. That diesel fuel is very hard to get off my hands! The gas station has a little glove dispenser, but it’s ALWAYS empty. Figures."

Pink is off-road diesel so I avoid it, but with the other options I get so overwhelmed. My dad told me to put #1 and 50/50 only if that’s the only option, but he texted me back too late.

cars,ewto2vq,t1_ewt9eoy,1565749828.0,I’m sorry you’re so bitter.. Is it because I’m a female.. ooorrrrr? Cause I totally only joined because I came across a post someone had been asking why more females don’t join the group..
cars,ewtnlo9,t1_ewtbgjd,1565749484.0,Emissions I guess. They weren’t up to code and were failing in the states that require your vehicle to run by certain standards. Mine was fixed. But I’m not in a state that emissions is an issue. So I am not entirely sure.
cars,ewtng1e,t1_ewtf160,1565749373.0,I have a GMC too. Didn’t know I had to have a certain type of vehicle. My bad.
cars,ewtnb4o,t1_ewtlayr,1565749278.0,Thank you
introvert,ews6hwm,t1_ews3zmf,1565721185.0,"Same, but it doesn’t matter either way! I’m terrible at small talk. I am just an awkward, anxious loner."
introvert,ews24ro,t1_ewrx9tk,1565718633.0,"Super weird coincidence, but I’m wearing an alien shirt today too !!"
Volkswagen,ewrt8nk,t1_ewrp1qa,1565713256.0,I love it! Kinda wish mine was red. But I love the black too. I wanna murder mine out but it seems like every single little boy who thinks they drive a race car murders out their car. I just love the sleek all black look.
Volkswagen,ewrt5sp,t1_ewrm3u4,1565713206.0,"It’s a TDI, but thanks. I still have my big old brute tho. It’s immaculate. I can’t give her up."
Volkswagen,ewrt3ra,t1_ewrj966,1565713170.0,I like that style. They’re Audi tho and I’m a weirdo! I like matching. I might just have the currents dipped black.
Volkswagen,ewrg279,t1_ewrd5gg,1565704548.0,17’ large & in charge lol
Volkswagen,ewqsbpb,t1_ewqry9g,1565676902.0,"My description is horrible. Like these.

Volkswagen,ewqs89m,t1_ewqry9g,1565676786.0,Yes! I’m in Minnesota. It’s pothole city around here. I was looking at some of those thicker 5 spoke wheels. Almost look like Chevy stock rims but more rounded. Hard to explain. Those would look excellent on the Doc I think!!
introvert,ewqs5ll,t1_ewqpvza,1565676695.0,I try. I could try harder. I’m really not a super emotionally expressive person. I’m very stoic in nature. It’s hard to explain. So I probably look like I’m mean or mad 24/7 but it’s just my face. I’m like the “paperwork” secretary from Monsters Inc. lol
introvert,ewqs1xk,t1_ewqpjvh,1565676572.0,"I’m not like making a checklist I just want friends that I don’t feel like I’m stressed out just having them there because I feel like I need to constantly be entertaining them. Idk if that makes sense. Sometimes I don’t know what to say. So I don’t talk. I’m also Narcoleptic, so some days I am having a bad day and can’t make it to plans and all my “friends” now get mad. I don’t do it on purpose and now none of them talk to me. Said I’m a flake. I dont disclose my narcolepsy in full detail and I shouldn’t have to explain it to them that I have an autoimmune disease and can’t help it. They know I have it and what it does. That’s it"
introvert,ewqrvje,t1_ewqpfxa,1565676357.0,Thank you!
Volkswagen,ewqrusq,t1_ewqoiu4,1565676332.0,"They’re fine, just feel too big. They’re the same size as my truck rims. They’re not bad. Just too flashy for me."
PiercingAdvice,ewqoqij,t3_cpo6zj,1565672815.0,"Put your finger in your nose and guide it through. Mine does this too if I don’t. Because you’re not angling it the right direction. My nose is pierced at a slight angle down. I don’t know if everyone else has this, but I couldn’t get it in when I first changed it. Left it out. Went for a walk and tried again later and used my finger to guide it and move it a little and it went right in. It’s hard to explain.

Edit: my nose has been pierced for 10 years and I still have to do this"
tdi,ewqnv9g,t1_ewqnehd,1565671919.0,"I have the DSG. I thought it was a manual when I planned on looking at the car. I had been stalking him online for weeks, but was a little weary about a diesel. I went to test drive it and there was no clutch. Lol the dealer said it’s an automatic. I was like... oh... but I’ve learned so much more about it. I like it. Came from a GMC Yukon. The mpg is insane! I’m loving that the most."
Volkswagen,ewqnomd,t3_cphw2r,1565671729.0," Not in my car, but my Yukon was doing this and it turns out it was like EVERYTHING. Upper and Lower ball joints and cv axle seals. It’s like a huge pop. I could feel it in the floor boards. Made me cringe every time. But if it was checked out and they say it’s fine I’m probably wrong. I happened mostly when I would turn and there’s a bump. Like into my driveway or whatever."
Anxiety,ewqmrpk,t3_cpfdb1,1565670822.0,Yes. Every time I think I’m having a heart attack.. “this is it. I’m dying” and then two hours later I’m still alive.
Volkswagen,ewqmis2,t3_cozu28,1565670579.0,That color is amazing!
Volkswagen,ewqmfss,t3_cpm32u,1565670499.0,Just bought one. Love it so far.
tdi,ewkgini,t1_ewiq2qj,1565483789.0,Also I’m in Minnesota and t gets cold. I’m worried for the winter. I have a garage but it isn’t heated
tdi,ewkgecm,t1_ewkc0l6,1565483699.0,I’ll see if I have a light like that pop up once I leave target. I am going to check the service records and see if it was done I have a few in the glove box from previous owner. But it’s from a dealer so I didn’t get the opportunity to talk to the previous owner directly. It’s a one owner vehicle. If I don’t see anything about it I’ll go have it done ASAP! This is good to know because I had no idea. First vehicle was a Ford Ranger. Second was a GMC Yukon. So I have 0 experience and I don’t want to learn the hard way lol
tdi,ewkg873,t1_ewitjx4,1565483567.0,Yes this is the exact thing. You just explained it better!
tdi,ewk9sw7,t1_ewiq2qj,1565478912.0,My dad tried to explain this. I’m not familiar at all! Newbie here. Lol
tdi,ewk9pyh,t1_ewim49j,1565478855.0,I’m not shifting it myself in the manual mode. This is happening in the normal D position. It’s confusing to explain. Super out of my element with this one ! Thank you tho!
