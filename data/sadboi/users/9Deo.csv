Thanks for the answer."

thewitcher3,fexnmke,t1_fexlasz,1579433699.0,"Thanks. That helps a lot.  


I just thought of another thing. Will starting this mission result in several failed side quests? If I recruit my allies to Kaer Morhen, can I still complete side quest related to those allies. For instance, I still have (at least) one side quest with Roche. If I ""move"" him to Kaer Morhen, will I fail that side quest? I already failed 6 quests, don't want to fail more :D"

bloodborne,f5exuje,t1_f5eqci4,1572176044.0,"Thank you for the insight. 

As I have mentioned before, the helpful comments (including this one) has motivated me to keep playing Bloodborne. So the following is just a fun discussion about difficulty.

There is no doubt that this is what Bloodborne is doing. You literally get funneled into a battle with a werewolf without any weapons. I personally just wish there was a resemblance of a learning curve in the beginning (after I finish Bloodborne I may feel different about this). Though it is not the same kind of game, Celeste is a perfect example of what I mean. The game tells you that dying makes you a better player. And the game is really, really hard. I wanted to rage quit many times. But the first couple of levels are relatively easy, and it allows the player to feel accomplished and get into a rhythm before being properly challenged. Bloodborne's first levels just made me feel like I should not have started the game, that I don't belong in this game."

mentalillness,ex1w0yu,t3_cqiyfy,1565957276.0,"I fully understand the point, and departments of education all over the world need to keep mental illness in mind when creating an education environment. However, I have to raise an issue with this picture. I imagine that people who have a great time in school don't google ""school makes me fulfilled"" or ""school makes me happy"". Of course, the negative/difficult situations pop up first on the search bar. That does not mean that many students (maybe even the majority) don't thrive in school :)"
