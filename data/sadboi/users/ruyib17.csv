Some people are nice, some not so much. I grew up on guam. Im half black and been dealing with shit my whole life. Im slightly jaded so sometimes it just rolls off my back depending on my frame of mind. Im glad your family is getting business. Non essential businesses have been ordered to shut down so no nail salons open that I know of but I'm sure some still are. Just want it to be over. You be safe out there."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fixp9nz,t3_fa3ytg,1582824461.0,My mom always tried to be patient with me cuz I was being bullied due to racism sudents and teachers. So whenever it got to much for me she let me stay home. Until once in my sophomore year and a teacher reported we got a visit from truant officer and she was so mad she made me live with my godparents for a while. As a teen the bullying was still occuring but eventually I was using it as an excuse to skip.
thesims,fixnzda,t1_fiw7lbg,1582823858.0,Thanks. I'm still trying to master controls since they differ from S3 so much but otherwise I'm enjoying the process. Games a little...PG for my tastes but easily fixed lol

iamatotalpieceofshit,fivrtnz,t1_fivqeuk,1582766633.0,"Why? Are you offended rather ""unsettled"" because you think of children sexually? While it isnt a crime to *think* sexual thoughts about under age kids it still doesnt take away the fact that its disturbing. 

""I find your desire for thoughtcrime pretty unsettling.""

Sir/Madame. I desire nothing of ""thought crime"" your desire to be personally offended is hilarious. I have no agenda to police people thoughts after all what I'd be arrested for thinking youre a baby diddler with that logic.  

I mean, did you even read?"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fivpsp0,t1_fivj20h,1582765369.0,"Yup. Even the ""non-offending"" ones. Just ticking time bombs really. I had an uncle who died that was self-proclaimed. know I sound ignorant and I feel raw saying this but they haven't offended because ""they wouldn't dream of hurting a child"" its because they havent met a child that they would cross that line for.   Their freedom is still more important than them, so they can still fight the urge to molest kids. There's other bs psychology to it I guess. They still think sexual thoughts towards kids They just dont act on it. They may or may not collect child porn. My uncle in particular, *claimed* he would never touched a child but his actions and words towards little boys always made us feel otherwise. Like when he would pay compliments to boys it was like he was talking to grown men and not that it matters in this case but his predilections swayed towards men. Like you dont call a 6yr ""sexy"" its uncomfortable and wrong. He was sick and weakly and could easily be fended off. I feel like his physical weakness was a hidden blessing."

lonely,fivdr5z,t1_fiuppoa,1582758521.0,Yup. Specifically underthose circumstances. These same type of dudes always expect the ideal partner for them to have it all going for them. Dudes want the maid the pornstar and personal chef and still expect nothing in return. Like sir thats your mom. Minus  the sex. *hopefully*
lonely,fivctr9,t1_fiux3d6,1582758051.0,"I think thats the problem. We all want to be liked for who we are, thats a given. What? You think ANYONE is gonna find a partner by not be able to at minimum,  not having a job, refuse to take care of themselves, or cant do basic cleaning? Bruh. It aint hard. These dudes keep missing the point. You can reiterate all day but they hear what they want. They think what they want even tho you try to tell them how things actually are. I worked with a dude who could ""never get a girlfriend"" 1. He had horrible hygiene, never showered, brushed his teeth or wore deodarant. You could smell him before you saw him and know he was in a room hours later. 2. He was kinda lazy, he put minimum effort in his work and only ever hung out with other guys of the same predilections. Idk."
atheism,fivanpu,t1_fiv8zc4,1582756970.0,"My anxiety won't let me be normal. Ngl, I got real defensive reading this and I don't know why. Probs cuz it read (to me) pithy and a little arrogant. Listen, I dont know. Like I know what this sub is. I wasn't raised in church. I'm not inherently against or for believing in whatever people believe in. Right now I'm just indifferent. I'm trying to focus on clarity for myself. I dont have anyone to talk to about it. People are either kinda crazy or God is real and you better not think otherwise. I'm not well read. But I dont think I'm stupid. Of course I believe in things.

Also, yes as a child I believed in leprechauns. Duendes to be exact. So did my mom. Its why i was baptized."

atheism,fiv840q,t1_fiv6u1e,1582755567.0,Call it residue guilt of a former life. This is a recent revelation for me after a string of self harm and depression befell me. Obviously GOD wasn't gonna help so why believe in him. God isn't punishing me society is. Or rather Im punishing myself. There's alot of habits to unlearn. Trying to just be happy isnt easy right now. I just turned 30. I woke up on day and realized god wasnt listening. Ive had suicidal tendencies since I was 12. Shoulda realized then.

atheism,fiuvi6j,t1_fiuu8ky,1582749024.0,"Exactly. While I may not completely understand the world as it is, whether or not I agree with other people's way of life. I'm not going out of my way to disrespect or belittle someone else. I never got the concept of just because I dont go to church somehow it makes me a bad person. I've worked for a non-profit ""Christian"" organization that is in place to help the homeless but I quickly saw that they just line the pockets of the board. I've volunteered for things, I've never cheated, been arrested, or broken public property etc. But yet to alot of people this simply isnt enough in the eyes of the believers. I know big deal right? Celebrating the baseline of what it means to be a decent human being. I dont know where I'm gonna be when I die. But it sounds like heaven is not the place I wanna be if all those toilet wads are gonna be there."
atheism,fiuu9r9,t1_fiuteox,1582748381.0,"Even surrounding myself around ""Christianity Centric"" people was rough. Either I couldn't qoute the bible correctly if at all.

But all I ever learned was to hate myself for not being good enough. So much for the love of Jesus huh."

hapas,fiuipbg,t3_f9v14x,1582742149.0,"Not sure if this answers your question....My current BF and I have been together for 3 years, not that long I know. Besides the few cultural hiccups, everything is fine. Like, Idk maybe its just a personal preference but I could live and be with family all day everyday because that's what im used to. He on the other hand only sees his family on holidays and bdays. Girls are raised a little old fashioned and one could say a little backwards. Gender roles and all that. ""Girls in the house, boys in the yard"" My BF is sorta... Spoiled. Nothing detrimental (to me) cuz I put up with a lot but so does he. He doesn't know how to cook doesn't really clean well, but he cleans up after himself. He was raised on ""find a nice girl, she'll take care of you"" and its annoying but we're working on it. Im not trying to ""change him"" cuz he's 36 it aint gonna happen anyway but learning to be considerate isnt his strong suit. I've never been with a guy who's parents take care of everything. I would say cultural differences don't matter unless someone makes it an obstacle. One caveat we do have is that he had such a *normal* and spoiled upbringing that he doesn't understand or that other people may have issues. He has little to no empathy for others and it hurts. But everyone has at least one shitty quality about them. Before that I was with a guy for 5 years who just fetishised me although I didnt know that at the time. He was only with me to use me as an incubator for ""pretty babies"". He was obsessed with my hair and feet. And of course skin tone. I was always stressed out. I miscarried twice in that relations with him. When he figured I wouldn't be getting pregnant he secretly moved to texas. I didn't know because he lived 3 hours away. It was toxic and eventually I let him go. He's with a full asian girl now. I'm just a mutt. My dad is a mix black and Cherokee. My mom is pacific islander, filipino and spanish but our family a bit of german in it."

I always wished my family could see me for me and treat me like ya know, like an actuall blood member of the family. But no, they could never get past my mom's choice of men. (considering the options were dating cousins or going ""outside"" her race, obviously she made a bad choice.) My aunts like to ""forget"" that they were hapas long before I was born for the sake of whatever side of the argument I was in. Doesn't matter. I was always wrong. I was raised on my grandmother's stories about who we are etc and I distinctly remember her saying that her mom was filipino and german. Anyway, genetics dont lie. Obviously we're mixed my bro and I's dad is black but be have very asian features. We fit in physically because we grew up on an island with all kinds of people and blended in. But because they knew our dad is black we had a hard time. Mostly me because I was supposed to be beautiful. And in our asian community I was too brown. In the chamorro community I was black. Nobody wanted to know me or be around me simply because of my race. I was abused by my teachers and excluded from activities. Holidays were always awful my mom always felt bad about how her family treated us and tried to opt out but they would force us to go so we could watch them ""have a good time"". But we always ended up huddled in the corner til it was time to leave. Christmas was the worst we never get anything and we had to sit there and watch the other kids open their gifts. But if my uncle george was drunk enough we could walk by him 3 or 4 times and he'd give us whatever pocket change he had. 
I always feel like im in some fantasy saga arguing about who's ""pure blood or not"" like its 2020 my family still 3 way calls about our lineage. 23 and me. So simple lol. People romanticize mixed people or fetishize hapas like we aren't real people. Or make comments that depending on the person can be offending. Idk. I don't even feel like a person.

Sims3,fh2apv5,t3_f10fxb,1581243513.0,"Walmarts around me still sell it. I've never even heard of the sims until my friend showed it to me. I think they do this because there's still people out there who've never heard of the games and this way the sims franchise can still make money off TS3. Maybe Idk its just my conspiracy.  I grew up poor so I didn't ""grow up"" with the games. But I still went back and played TS1 and TS2."

EDIT:
Alright, you want a fucking contribution to the conversation eh? My bf puts his xbox before me. Thats all he thinks about. He spends exactly no time with me. This morning he yelled at me because his 7 yr old toshiba tv broke in the bed room and told me to stop watching the nice tv in the living room. Because he doesnt want it running ""24/7"" Meanwhile, he falls asleep with it on and plays games all night. I don't eat dinner with him. Because he eats in front of madden. He doesnt sleep in our room because he crashes on the couch after all night gaming. We dont have sex because he's not interested anymore. He'd rather sit there and eat and make a nest surrounding him and get fat and blame me because I didn't stop him eating. So, rather than dumping him I've allowed this neglectful behavior to happen because as you gamers say ""thats what happens when you get with a gamer"" he's not out cheating. He doesn't physically hit me. But when I ask him to spend time with me, yells at me that ""he works all day and this is what he wants to spend time with"" but because I don't want him to feel like I'm trying to take anything away from him. I put up with him. He yells at me to the point of crying. OVER XBOX. And yells at me for crying because ""he didnt do anything. I have a shitty BF obsessed with a shitty inanimate object. So yeah thats why I'm on the fence. Downvote me some more."
