bipolar,f3b6x11,t3_dg2cjz,1570803223.0,"Its definitely a struggle some days. I found a job I love though, life enrichment for alzheimers patients. My days with them are singing and dancing, listening to there issues and getting them involved in conversations and activies in the building. Finding out there own passions and helping them find ways to still use it now a days, I play my violin for them. It's full time, with good pay and great insurance. It took along time to find and I never thought I would be able to do it. But even the bad days there consist of me using my own experiences in therapy and such to help my loving residents through panic attacks, anxiety and other side effects of there desiese. It helps that I know what its like to feel crazy or at least be looked at as such. It makes it easy to see them as normal people who just want to be treated and talked to that way. Alot of them are even on similar mood stabilizers I've been on! It's easy to relate to there frustrations and beautiful to connect with them and help them discover again how beautiful they are. Not every job is gonna be great I've had some really shitty or just ridiculously stressful ones, but I believe that people who have gone through the shit alot of us have come out stronger for it, and we can use our talents to make the world even brighter because we all know what it feels like to be in darkness. (Sorry if that's cheezy I just wanted you to know that there is hope out there it's a bitch to find sometimes but we can do it!)"
bipolar,ez8ifdm,t3_d0ai83,1567744432.0,"Hey, I know it's hard right now. Sometimes I like to journal to get rid of those negative thoughts, or even just video journal if I cant write them down. Sometimes it just helps me to look back and reread them instead of them circling my head a million times. I hope this helps everyone is different though! You'll get through this!"
bipolar,ewp50zf,t3_cpe1ds,1565633609.0,I bought this book it's by the same guy who did the Bojack Horseman show but it's so good
bipolar,etowvok,t3_ccoru0,1563039690.0,"To real, I gave some of these to my friends to I have so many and they were like ""it's so cool u got to keep these"" and I'm just like yeah, that's that cool side effect of psychosis, socks."
bipolar,eqx1adq,t3_bzikwp,1560363979.0,"Hi, I'm Rose. I was diagnosed at about 19 with bipolar type 1, but I was diagnosed like a whole books worth of stuff before that. I've been through hell and back with a lot of this junk. I'd like friends tho too, it's really hard to relate to people well now a days. You start feeling like your really crazy sometimes and it kinda can take over. I'm always open to friends though"
bipolar,eqwzccf,t3_bzqsp9,1560363337.0,"While in a longer manic episode that lasted around 2 months I got into smoking cigarettes (among other things) it was unfortunately a byproduct of some not so helpful ""friends"" I was paling around with at the time. I have to say, I really tried to get into it, I bought pack after pack hoping an addiction would form so I could feel that relief of the next smoke and it didnt happen. I dont know why but I'm so greatful. Smoking didnt make me feel any better (I was using it as a very roundabout self harm technique anyways) and it certainly wont make anything in life better to get yourself into an addiction. I was really lucky that habit didnt stick and once my mania was over I didnt smoke again. It's not gonna be worth it long or short run."
bipolar,eqjjinw,t1_eqjhmkg,1560105940.0,"I think it's right to say medications are needed at certain points in many peoples lives, but I just also happen to feel that for myself and many others medications arnt always the end all be all, I didnt go off the medications without doctors approval and support that not all people need lifelong medications to lead long and happy lives. Not saying I might not myself need medication again in the future or be open to the idea but many who are very sensitive to medications (such as myself) really can be more unhappy in the long run due to meds. This of course is only applicable to some cases, just like some cases require lifelong medications or changes over time."
bipolar,eqcu4oh,t3_bxqra0,1559978068.0,"During my last manic episode not only did I heavily drink, but I also slept with my very close friend (who has a boyfriend and was also drunk) but then ended up taking someone else's prescription of ativan to attempt to ""come down"" after that didn't work I continued to take mixes of prescription and non prescription drugs to make myself feel anything aside from extreme anxiety. It did work but I also havnt been able to eat anything more then very small meals of nuts or spinach without vomiting since so idk what the hell I did or the anxiety is just taking a new terrible form."
bipolar,eq7b1l8,t3_bxful6,1559843665.0,"I've met so many people who get diagnosed and then like magic they are cured it doesnt come up again. You dont just start seeing a therapist and everything is ok, or take your first medication and bam never have to deal with that again. Idk it's a process and if always felt that people like that make me feel worse and people actually suffering have to overcome this stigma that you go to the doctor or go in house one time and then you come out ""cured"" it's just not how anything works."
