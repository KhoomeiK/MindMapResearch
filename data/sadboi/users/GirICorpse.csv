His mom was the one who found her when she was cleaning his room, went behind his bed and found a small sock but it wasn’t a sock, it was her foot and she was inside of the waterbed... he was arrested and is serving life. Before the daughter went missing, her parents realized that someone repeatedly broke into their house, and stole the photos of their daughter in her leotard and dance class... strange."

Advice,fpfilg2,t3_gd2lp6,1588572351.0,"You should try antidepressants. I’m 20 and female and have had this issue as well, for most of my life. It’s unfortunate. That’s an understatement. But I bought antidepressants the other day, prescription of course, and I’m going to try them to see if they help. You should too, and you should try and find a new therapist. If you are in college, most colleges should offer free counseling services. That’s not a real therapist if she ghosts you. Another thing I recommend doing is not sleeping in all day, that can be very bad and make you feel worse about yourself. Also you NEED to take care of yourself physically, brush your teeth, eat, drink water, get some sun or at least take Vitamin D because that will make you feel better as well. Look who’s talking, I never take my medicine :( but still you should do it. Also, keep your stuff organized and clean so it doesn’t pile up because that will add on. The smallest things actually add up and create worse issues. But when you wake up in the morning, make your bed. And then when you get into bed that night, you will feel accomplishment that you did something productive and that will create a domino effect.
