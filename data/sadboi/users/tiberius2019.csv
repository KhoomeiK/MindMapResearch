Watchmen,fb1am59,t3_e83yg0,1576434153.0,Ok did Dr Manhattanâ€™s actions right at the end seem super weird to you all? Why not just... teleport away? There was more than enough time while the special tachyon thing was getting setup
Watchmen,fact324,t1_facgxfd,1575946375.0,Where did that line first pop up?
Watchmen,facshry,t1_faci27l,1575945976.0,Or why not just teleport out and move things forward on his terms... less drama that way I suppose
bioinformatics,f8di8or,t3_e0cltv,1574492012.0,"Soooo after spending several years trying to explain urban informatics (""data science for cities""), seeing these struggles makes me smile a bit. I file all this under the difficulties in communicating in lay terms as the world gets more and more hyper-specialized. Maybe one day the informatics bit will become superfluous as there won't really be any substantive discipline that doesn't integrally use informatics."

bipolar,f0982xa,t3_d46ed3,1568495725.0,What about depakote?
bipolar,f097m7d,t1_f02nmv2,1568495464.0,Yeah I've definitely learned the importance of being a self-advocate. I probably would have been stuck there for two weeks without the tireless work of my wife.
bipolar,f097iji,t1_f02h1lw,1568495408.0,Thanks! Yeah I wish more people knew these stories so something-could-be-done to improve our mental health system. Really sad sigh.

* Find a friend or family member that you're comfortable having poke you to get of your own head aka drop little comments like ""pay attention"""
bipolar,eznfq60,t3_d1cg18,1568005275.0,"Bit of a tangent though I feel like psychiatric professionals should have to spend some time in a psych ward so they understand what it's like from a patients perspective. Grok the ""do no harm"" bit of the hippocratic oath and impress upon them the need to avoid the soul sucking prison like aspects of it. Little things like petty power plays from psych ward techs or rec rooms with board games that key pieces years ago show how little these institutions can value their ""patients"" sadly."
bipolar,ezndtuc,t3_d1cg18,1568004484.0,Anyone here have a \*positive\* experience in a psych ward?

bipolar,ewgzdr5,t1_ewfapsx,1565394005.0,How old are you out of curiosity?
bipolar,ewgzb8b,t1_ewf6mxo,1565393959.0,Nice (minus the cat...) been doing a lot of home improvement stuff recently as well. Latest is repainting the kitchen.
bipolar,ewgz8x2,t3_cnxp9e,1565393914.0,"I was diagnosed bipolar about 5 months ago during an intense episode involving some pretty extreme exercise, fasting and firing myself from my startup so the team could keep going. I'm still really annoyed at the treatment I got in Kaiser and not really sure what to do with that frustration. TLDR is I got pushed into in-patient therapy by a bureaucratic machine that provided poor options and worse information about basic things like the costs of the stay to my wife and family. I filed a complaint though that just got cycled through the Kaiser borg-like bureaucracy as well. Sucks to feel powerless but hey there's always ranting on the internet! Thanks for opening the thread."
