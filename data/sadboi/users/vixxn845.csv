TwoXChromosomes,etsy3aq,t1_etmwonu,1563158786.0,"It's probably more about the fact that women are not seen as equal to men, so a crime committed by a man against a woman is generally treated like ""no big deal"". Brock Turner, for example, as well as a myriad of other well known sexual assaults and rapes. 

The shitty reality of the situation is that there can be witnesses to an aggravated sexual assault and still end up with no convictions. It's bullshit"
TwoXChromosomes,etsxuwl,t1_etmn8v8,1563158597.0,I was not responding to the OP. I would not respond to the OP directly and suggest a course of action regarding legal stuff. I was responding to another person who commented.
TwoXChromosomes,etsxn3k,t1_etmkxbt,1563158421.0,"It's a shame every time a woman is assaulted. It's a shame every time a woman who was assaulted is afraid to speak out. It's really a shame every time a woman who was assaulted does speak out and her assailant is allowed to go free or gets a bullshit slap on the wrist. 

I think it's worse to re-traumatize women and put them through reporting and a trial without preparing them for the reality. Women don't get equal justice. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Nothing will ever change if we don't try. But I think it's really important to be honest. 

Every woman who reports is incredibly brave and possesses a kind of strength that most people only ever see in movies. It is an uphill battle and it fucking sucks. But every time it's another step forward and it's important.

Please don't mistake my direct approach for dissuasion. Anyone who feels like they are capable of fighting that battle absolutely should if they want to. If someone does not feel capable, I get it. It means going through your whole trauma over again, multiple times, for strangers. That's awful. I can't blame anyone who doesn't feel up to it."
TwoXChromosomes,etm8ybn,t1_etm8j0w,1562954638.0,"Realistically, with how fucked up society views sex and consent and rape, even with that information I think it would be exceedingly difficult to find anyone to prosecute this, and even harder to find a jury that would convict him.

Not because he wasn't wrong. Not because he wasn't guilty. But because our society is pretty fucked about this topic."
