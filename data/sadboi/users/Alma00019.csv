Anyway, the government propaganda is really bad, I do agree with you. Honestly, here in the US, the deaths are vastly overreported and hospitals are big paid around (rough number) $20,000 to report a death as COVID. In the US, COVID19 is a hoax, meant to tank the economy so that the government can put all Americans on welfare and usher in socialism here. Also, the Democrats pretty much planned this so Trump isn't reelected. And they want us to wear masks when we go outside! Can you believe it?? The NERVE! They are truly trying to destroy whatever little is left of our constitution and our rights - but we won't let them! I am an American and I will NOT allow the government to trample on MY RIGHTS and tell me what I must wear when I leave the house! I laugh - LAUGH - at all the sheeple morons who mindlessly believe government propaganda and go outside wearing masks. The idiots!  Like the sheep to slaughter. They will be standing in socialist bread-lines soon, thanking the government for their crust of stale bread. Not me! I see through the propaganda. Covid19 is a complete lie (at least in the US, that is; clearly it is very dangerous in Poland and I see your government is lying to you and trying to make you believe it's far less deadly than it is really is) and no more deadly than the common flu, less deadly in fact!

So I got you! We must fight this government propaganda together!

Covid19 is a funny virus, isn't it? It changes according to the needs of a country's government. In Poland it is very dangerous and the evil Polish government is covering up deaths, while in the US covid19 is not dangerous at all and the evil US government is inflating the number of deaths."

For example, take typhus. Eastern Europe experienced far more typhus epidemics than Western Europe did, and so typhus wasn't/isn't quit as deadly for Eastern Europeans than it was for Western Europeans. This was highlighted during WWII, when typhus epidemics often swept Poland and other nations, and the Nazi concentration camps. Germans were deathly afraid of contracting typhus, so when an area was experiencing a typhus epidemic, they tended to avoid that area and were afraid to go there. In concentration camps, the barracks affected by typhus were left unattended by the guards and soldiers.

If any one of those 372 people had gotten sick, they would have known, because they would have be sick - i.e. showing symptoms. And the people doing contact tracing would obviously know this, since the people doing contact tracing were explicitly reaching out to those people.

btw, I am not a denier. I was reading about this virus in January, horrified at at the videos and texts coming out of China from private citizens and whistleblowers trying to get past the Chinese community government censorship and warn the world. While the vast majority of Americans and the American media were blissfully unaware about what was going on in China and that this virus would be on our shores soon (or that it even existed), I was preparing for it and warning my friends and family.

But I try to not give into paranoia and fear mongering. I read A LOT about the virus virus and am still reading a lot about it now as more findings come out. Stay safe, but keep your wits about you. And don't get mad at people for following the rules - the beaches are open, the rules are to stay 6 feet apart and that's what people are doing.

This lockdown was never to eradicate the virus, but to flatten the curve so 1) hospitals can keep up, 2) to give time to the medical community to come up with treatments and protocols, 3) find a cure/vaccine, 4) attain herd immunity.

Out and about in town or the city, yes. Inside any buildings, YES. But socially distancing outside in nature, where evidence shows that transmission is extremely low if not impossible, it's overkill. Those beaches don't look crowded. They look like they are staying away from each other. If a family decides to lay out in the sun on the sand 6+ feet away from anyone else, why should they wear a mask? And swimming or even just going in the water? With a mask? That will do more harm than good. If the mask gets wet then it will be more prone microbes and transmitting virals. And if the mask gets wet then it will be harder to breathe because the mask will be water logged, what then? Struggle breathing? Take off the mask? Could have done that in the first place.

The wife had traveled to China and visited relatives in a hospital, got sick, and then her husband got sick a week later.

&#x200B;

Contact tracing was done on both of these people, 372 people in all. ZERO of those people got sick.

&#x200B;

So it appears to get sick, you need to be in an enclosed space with a sick person showing symptoms, or in an enclosed space where a sick person showing symptoms was and shed a lot of viral matter, for a prolonged period of time.

We know none of those 372 people got sick, but did some get infected but were asymptomatic?"
COVID19,fpxkokx,t1_fpxb2iz,1588984404.0,That's also a very good point.
COVID19,fpx7wj5,t1_fpvwjs7,1588977379.0,">I would assume because the symptomatic patient, by remaining stationary in an enclosed room, is flooding the room with a high dose of the virus over time. By entering in the same room, even around 2 hours, you have a risk of getting an infectious dose, though it’s low.

Also it would seem to me that it would depend on how long you stay in an area with the ""infected air"" (for lack of a better term). If you're passing someone in the hallway, you're in that spot for a 1 second. If you go into a room, how long do you have to be there to get infected? 1 minute? 5 minutes? 2 hours?"
COVID19,fpx7ob1,t1_fpvzh12,1588977251.0,"They were also all together in an enclosed space for several hours. So maybe walking by someone who has it isn't necessarily enough to infect you, but you also don't need to live day in and day out with an infected person to catch - several hours in an enclosed space is enough."

Yeah, if you have another freezer to move them to, then yeah you could certainly do that.

Eat the veggies and then buy more meat going forward.

There are plenty of vegetarian recipe blogs, and tons of great veggies recipes.

You can also use veggies to to make vegetable stock. Use canning methods to safely store it in your pantry.

Speaking of canning, you can make sauces, stews, chilis, curries, jams, preserves, etc with the surplus veggies and fruit and can them and have them for later.  I love bean or lentil stews with veggies. Serve it over rice. Beans and lentils have protein.

How to safely can foods:

If you have children, cooking up big batches of veggie meals and canning can be a great pandemic family activity.
