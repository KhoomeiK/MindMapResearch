React to what they are doing and punish that option with your faster ones or punish the focus with a multi hit or something else. You were winning neutral until the shield break in the first game then you started being timid close distance and win neutral and PT is broken in advantage aggressive switches is something I’m trying to improve on too"
NessMains,f97ywxc,t3_e3z7e8,1575171950.0,The problem. Online is ass . Just mix up your approaches ness does not lose this match up. It’s about even. Put pressure space offstage is essentially your domain. Plus thunder mops YL gimping with tail is nice spiking is pretty easy.
NessMains,f90yors,t3_e33qjx,1574979354.0,So inkling has some of the best whiff punishing in the game because of their speed. You have to space them and slowly fight for stage control off stage  should be all ness just keep in mind the up b start up has a hitbox

NessMains,f7erf8f,t3_dvkjat,1573664162.0,"Yeah it doesn’t matter. PK Fire is so laggy I use it to punish a whole lot, or to space and rarely to approach. If I notice the opponent not SDIing I usually follow up with another fire or two then fair . Racks up mad damage. If it’s your buddies and you’re just having fun tell them to SDI up and away. If you’re in bracket fuck em. There is no morality involved honestly. Pk Fire isn’t a busted move."

NessMains,f5xvxgb,t1_f5wqvp2,1572547038.0,That’s good. Punish jumps throw out fire and see how he reacts. Nair Gordo is pretty effective. Then once you’re in don’t give him space to set up keep stage control get your combos and reset neutral.  As you have stage control he’ll have to do something so you can do some wild shit like thunder two. Dedede is combo food and he’s a huge hurt box it’ll be hard to get out of disadvantage

NessMains,f56efy5,t3_dmzj0r,1572022182.0,Don’t fight neutral with Mac he will beat out your options wait something out until you can get a gimp or mad damage. Banjo I always grab the grenade and try psi magnet combos the cool thing is that you can absorb the grenade while banjo still gets hit by it. Again space out the eggs until you have an opening always respect side b.  Hero has a very exploitable recovery plus you can get mad heals from most of his moves.
NessMains,f55w4h0,t1_f54re4e,1572014654.0,Lol you have to be inside the mind of a 13 year old to play ness

NessMains,f4wrj1o,t1_f4uxl30,1571859123.0,When a player punished bad plays styles they get better. So if you see a ness spam just wreck them.
NessMains,f4ukt1i,t1_f4ujjjj,1571815327.0,"Dealing with projectiles doesn’t help with dealing with projectiles 9/10 times wut.  Also it’s not promoting it it’s matchup dependent if you’re playing against someone that doesn’t know how to DI out guaranteed I’m hitting two or three then DT for mad damage. If you don’t recognize and abuse your opponents mistakes you’re only hindering yourself. I only have 500 hours of gameplay so I’m not a pro, but I’d like to think I know a good amount about competing in this game.  Sometimes fair fair psi magnet dair works sometimes it doesn’t because of DI does that not promote growth? It’s the same brain dead thing essentially."
NessMains,f4tg126,t1_f4t8wgm,1571787954.0,Why though if it works it works. It teaches you how to deal with projectiles and how to SDI and DI. If you get caught by a pk Fire spam take it as a lesson.
