depression,fgqsyc0,t3_f00qvy,1581030818.0,"Firstly, it could just be a realization. Having a change in outlook can change your mood on certain things.

Secondly, you could have had a change in hope. Meeting someone you're interested in is hard when you don't know if they are interested in you. Having a longing for something you feel is out of reach is difficult for the mind to accept. 

Thirdly, losing interest. If you start to not enjoy things it can make you less happy.

What it personally sounds like is an increase in general anxiety. Is there any new pressure you have now? Any reason at all to not mess up? (It could be the girl)

Is there a new reason for you to be high strung or nervous?"

depression,fgqrz7g,t3_f00grh,1581030217.0,"It might be hard, but you have to figure out what's bothering her. 

It might be worth just reassuring her that you enjoy her company or car for her. I know some people just dont feel wanted.

This can also relate to family. If her family doesn't care for her then you can also try to fill a void of support.

If it has to do with having to deal her future, you can help her see her potential. Or even tell her things she can persue.

If it's just because of feeling like life is pointless, I think this normally relates to not being able to be happy. This is really broad and is probably the most common reason people commit suicide imo. I honestly dont know what to do for this except trying to help her be happy. Not just what she normally does to make others happy. 

When asking people like this, they might just agree to do whatever you want to do to make you happy. If this does happen make sure to appreciate them for what they do. 

It's also worth noting that if she hasn't told you until now, she probably hasn't told anyone. Just having this feeling inside you can make it really hard to keep living. You can try to be as easy to talk to as possible to ensure she feels comfortable and has someone to talk to. You might have to ask questions that are a little personal, but you'll have to be the judge of boundaries and support.

Advice,fgp39xb,t3_ezs9rw,1580995675.0,"I think it's kind of demanding to have to do that to keep a relationship. I have never been in one, but I think there should at least be a mutual trust and respect. 

If you are sorry for whatever you did, you already know your motives were bad. You shouldn't have to explain why you did something if you definitely regret it and know it was a bad idea.

This is a bad situation, I have never had to deal with my family like you did. I have no clue what it's like.

I just recently found at least one person who has actually texted me first. About anything. This is one thing I can relate. People very quickly figure out who i am and then dont like me. That's cool, i didn't really like people anyway. I dont like texting or talking first because of the fear of being bothersome. It is nice to feel like someone actually like me as me. 

I hope you can find someone to talk to.
