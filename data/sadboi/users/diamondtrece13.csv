It was a dead end road not maintained by the state and I had to work. I didnt have my own car at the time but it hadnt ever posed a problem as i was able to get a ride. That day, my ride took me, slipping and sliding off the road several times before we even got up the hill, and they told me they would not come back to get me at 11 that night since it was so dangerous. I showed up in person to explain the situation and the big manager, whom I'd never even seen in the store before, read me a riot act about not wanting to work and how he'd never missed a day of work in 20 years. He said if I left I'd be fired. I quit that day.

Edit: it's worth it to note that my ride lived in the same place and also worked at walmart and worked that day and they were told it was ok not to come in."
