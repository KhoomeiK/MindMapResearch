She knew I was damaged mentally by my environment though I was not diagnosed until I was 28. I'd lived all those years with, in a nutshell, multiple personality disorder. CPTSD with a Covert Dissasociative Identity Disorder is what you'd call it now.

I turned 31 last year. Passed my driving test. Got an interesting job with nice people. Something I wanted all my life.
I'm living my teenage years finally...

That is actually really sad in one light. But it is my reality. A 31 year old teenager. 
I did support myself for many many years but it was agony. I caved last year and asked for help.

In another light it does mean I am actually in recovery if I'm living those years now. I'm starting to move on. Learn new habits. Discard the outdated ones.

I know I'm talking about myself but here's the sympathetic link.

Neither of us asked for this. You didn't ask to be ill. Nor did you deserve it. The hand was dealt and we play on with the painful game. But we have voices, thoughbeit small at times it still makes a sound. Take what you can, even if it's limited and start fighting twice as hard. Pull in whoever you can to help. Effort is rewarded and no one gets anywhere on their own.

I wish I knew what to tell you beyond that. Give you a solution and make it better. I hate hearing people struggle. Especially in such circumstances. 

There will be a path for you. You just have to fight and work twice as hard to see it clearly. It's undoubtedly unfair I know, but it's the only hand we have to play. My future is a blur too.

If nothing works then you need to start learning more about how it all works for you. Map out and label up. Keep a record of triggers, when you dissociate. Read up on how the condition works.

You question whether the knock was just a knock or whether there was threat behind it. 

If abuse was unpredictable then this can be a strong development in threat responses. 

I've not got to the bottom of it but practicing stillness and safeness for prolonged periods causes it to lessen I've found personally. It's vital you're not still experiencing trauma to break through these walls mind. Actual safety is where to start.

Best wishes on the path. X

It's one of the toughest battles personally.

I'm currently practicing being ok in quiet and calm situations. Also proactive in regards to the small stuff with lists and organisation.

I'm the king conflict and difficult situations. Tell me to relax for a day and I'm climbing the walls with flashbacks and mood swings. Yet I so desperately need to relax...

So yeah, I'm with you. Best wishes getting through it. You're not alone. X"
ptsd,f6io365,t3_dr60r7,1572881684.0,"I agree that it can assist the blocking of processing and indeed can be used to mask but personally I'm still not ready to hand it in.

CPTSD from childhood to young adult and I started smoking in my early teens. It prolonged the serious emergence which came in my mid 20's. I can't regulate my DID without it and I actually disassociate less while stoned. Though obviously that's not a permanent solution, for me it's a regulator that keeps me away from pharmaceuticals which I'm strongly against. 
I don't drink alcohol at all. That's just fuel for my demons.

It definitely affects us all differently and though it's contrary to what I do, your best chance is to tackle this path as sober as possible. 

Best wishes and strength on the path everyone. X"
