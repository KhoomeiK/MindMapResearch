BPD,fitdmcb,t3_f9llcb,1582716153.0,"I totally get this and find myself doing the same thing. It normally stems from people shutting you down in your childhood. The way I cope with it is to completely separate myself from them in my own head. This might not be the healthiest way, but I just look down on them internally and assert my superiority in my imagination. Sometimes the illusion of power is enough to get you through the day, and it definitely helps with avoiding any external conflict."

BPD,filvdkx,t1_filv3ky,1582511252.0,"There is little to no evidence that this is a temporary problem. I am 100% sure of who I am and how my mind works, and what I can and can't handle, and I know that I'm too much for this world and too different for it, too. I will never fit."

INTP,f2v70vn,t1_f2v6vl1,1570447512.0,I'm not butthurt. I appreciate the advice. I think it just boils down to either a fear or inability to connect. Can I ask what answer you were looking for when you posted this originally? I'm interested to hear what you think my answer should have been.
INTP,f2v6na7,t1_f2v687p,1570447247.0,"Ok there is literally no need to be so aggressive, I was just trying to explain myself but I don't think I worded it correctly. Let me rephrase; I feel like my outside and my inside are completely disconnected, and the result of that is an in-built mistrust of people. The example I used was just a microcosm for a bigger issue which is that I feel ultimately completely undeserving of human contact because I barely feel like a person. I'm not sure how to fix this. I'm sorry if I came of arrogant or pretentious, it was not my intention at all. 

I've been taken advantage of a lot in my life (2 year abusive relationship, rape, physical abuse) and that combination of that with my natural introverted state has caused me to struggle with trusting others. This is a dangerous space for an INTP to reach and I'm just trying really hard to pull myself out of that, and I thought by replying to your post I might get some advice. Sorry if I made you angry or upset."
INTP,f2v6046,t1_f2v5web,1570446789.0,"that's not very nice. i'm lame in a lot of ways sure, but mainly all of that just makes me feel alone. i'm not really sure how to fix it."
INTP,f2tzbot,t3_de7sk9,1570403412.0,"it's not so bad. for example, a person will talk to me as if i'm the exact opposite of my true self. they start trying to make small talk or tell me about their day or offer an opinion on something, and they think i'll respond positively. i don't normally respond at all because i'm having 5 different conversations in my head and i've already thought of every possible outcome and interaction with this hypothetical person and they're all boring so i just stare and make them uncomfortable so they leave me alone. 

it gives you a distinct advantage in both avoidance and making friends (if you want, i don't)"
