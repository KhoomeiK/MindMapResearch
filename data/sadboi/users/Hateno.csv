Edit: $40 for 10 packets is one of the subscription prices. It's the default option when looking at subscriptions. To get the price down to $4 for 400 calories, you have to spend $240 on 120 packets."

(how was that?)"
soylent,fpdwt53,t3_gcw7qr,1588535812.0,"It seems really wasteful to have each packet only contain 200 calories.    

Also 40 dollars for 10 packets comes out to 8 dollars a meal (if you count a meal as 400 calories)."

TheExpanse,f2fhv7p,t3_dckron,1570218047.0,"This is just personal preference, but I would much prefer having discussion threads for each individual episode be made as soon the season drops. Have the overall S4 discussion act as a hub with links to each episode discussion. I'm going to want to discuss each episode, but I'm not going to watch 1 episode a week.   
Idk, I might be alone in this.   

Edit: [something like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/chvrsz/the_boys_season_1_discussion_thread/)"
Anxiety,ew36nz3,t1_ew35kdk,1565065965.0,"Thanks for the heads up. For the last few weeks I've been limiting myself to 20g or less of sugar per day for physical health reasons, but maybe it will also be good for mental health too!  

The ice cream I have right now (called Enlightened) is 4g of sugar per serving and it's actually pretty dang tasty."
