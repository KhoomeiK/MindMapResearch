prozac,fjm6i70,t1_fjm49t3,1583462741.0,I‚Äôve been on it since November.  It was so amazing during the first month but I had a bad breakup and everything went really down hill. I attempted during that time and was put in the ward where I was taken off an extra medication and upped my dose to 30mg. After that things were just never the same.  I‚Äôve had my good days and a few weeks but everything eventually fell apart
prozac,fjm69tt,t1_fjm445w,1583462592.0,Thank you I probably will. It‚Äôs just both my parents are doctors and my mom is a narc so she‚Äôs always uptight about this stuff. And she‚Äôs convinced prozac is the only  drug I should be on because she knows it‚Äôs safe   I‚Äôm seeing my doctor soon so I‚Äôll talk to her

I understand the no eating tho, im 16 and prozac made me not eat at all, pretty much developed a minor eating disorder, but it really depends on the person, i was on 30mg so it could be different, when i was on 10 it was actually really good.
