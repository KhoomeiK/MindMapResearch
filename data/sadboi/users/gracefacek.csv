Marriage,fq8beq1,t3_gh5m0m,1589162406.0,I feel you. My husband said happy mother's day when I walked into he bedroom and he was just getting up at 10 am. I had been up since 6. Cleaning up his mess from his guys night last night. The rest of the day he spent watching TV and totally ignored everyone.
personalfinance,fpvk7gp,t1_fpvhuof,1588946450.0,If you're moving to another state and plan on visiting alot maybe consider a card that will help you do that. I love my southwest card. When I signed up years ago I did so through a special promotion which was enough for a few flights for free.
DeadBedrooms,fpvhd0a,t1_fojmxmf,1588944794.0,So things are better. Hey this makes you sound like an asshole. üó£Ô∏è She was trying to get you to take control.
personalfinance,fpvg5hn,t3_gfsr1e,1588944035.0,Personally I would leave it open and charge a tank of gas every now and then. Then open a different card. You will have more available credit. Applying for another card will make it dip for a short time but has a minimal impact on your score.
personalfinance,fpvephp,t3_gfrrz9,1588943096.0,We just went through the process of getting our pre-approval. I also didn't want to buy until I knew we have enough of an emergency fund. When I reached the 800's I thought we would be able to get a better interest rate. My husband filed bankruptcy 4 years ago bf we were married his credit score is in the 600's. I was shocked when his mortgage score was higher than mine?! Its a total different score. With the help of the lender they were able to fast track remove accounts that we're incorrectly reported.  We're using a VA but I would suggest looking into the first time home program and they will guide you on what to do and help you improve your scores. Get your debt paid off and then save.

femalehairadvice,fpcq9po,t1_fodslap,1588509591.0,I'm not sure what to suggest you buy but once a salons open I would ask for a demi permanent gloss. They'll know. Redken Shades is one that's conditioning and makes your hair more manageable and shiny.
femalehairadvice,fpcq469,t1_fodqcrk,1588509456.0,Try a demi permanent gloss of color depositing shampoo. Its a great no commitment way to try.
femalehairadvice,fodrqa5,t3_g5lhy6,1587688886.0,Yes longer bangs but you should also layer your hair a little. With the shape/length of your bob it would look like a little girls haircut imo. Beautiful hair!!

hemorrhoid,fibjov6,t3_evpjce,1582323412.0,"Yes. Depends. What are you doing at the gym? Does it bother you? 

Mine comes and goes. At the moment it's inflamed. So I am avoiding squats and heavy lifting that will cause strain in that area. Other than than every thing else is fine for me. Just listen to your body if you feel you need a break don't go that day."
Marriage,fi7efwh,t3_f6ckyr,1582219799.0,I am married to an alcoholic. It is really hard. I grew up with an alcoholic parent as well. My Husband and I have been together for 6 years and have two children. I didn't know how bad his drinking was in the beginning because he traveled for work and he was always drinking (which I didn't know) so I never saw him sober. A few years ago he came home just as your husband did and shouldn't have drove home. I was sleeping after putting our children down and it was my fault he drove drunk because I didn't hear my phone. He put his fist through a TV and threatened me. If he is a mean drunk most likely it will get worse. I hope he realizes this But HE has to want to be better. If this is not what you want for your life I suggest really thinking about things before you have children. When we had children everything changed. He became a more mean and violent drunk. He is not a great father or partner in raising children. He has told me countless times he will quit never lasts more than two weeks tops and that's like a years time for him. Patting himself on the back for going sooo long wo a drink...can you believe it?...and hours later will walk in drunk. I don't drink more than maybe 4 times a year max and each time I might have 1 beer if some people go out after work. I never drink in front of him or around him or bring it into our home.

depression,fdacnky,t3_ekfris,1578244651.0,The most important lesson I've learned and I wish I knew when I was 17 is your happiness depends on you. It is not fair to put it on some one else. Find happiness within. Do more of what makes you happy. The rest will fall into place. Trust me
depression,fd501l0,t1_fd4py5o,1578172803.0,You're very welcome. When I say little I mean really little. Like the smell of coffee in the morning or a hot shower. I spent alot of time outdoors hiking appreciating the warmth of the sun and how it shined through the trees. Hang in there.
depression,fd4kil2,t3_ek1k92,1578168369.0,I feel this so much. I am sorry you feel this way. In my late 20's I went through the same thing. Feeling like everyone else had it figured out but me. My relationship ended and I was lost. I just tried to focus on the little things that brought me joy and it all seemed to come together. Wether there is a point or not you are here and for a short time. Try and enjoy the little things and get outside. Hopefully it will get better for you. Congrats on your PhD.

sexover30,fcl6qqz,t3_ehrh9b,1577741009.0,"I would ask. 

But from a female perspective...rough sex I enjoy hair pulling, arms being held down, doggy style when he wraps his arm around my neck ahhh but it could just be a change in where you're having sex as well maybe not in the bedroom to change it up. 

For public fondling if she's wearing a dress you can run your hand up her skirt under the table or kiss on her neck. Sometimes after a dinner date we will have sex in the car which is fun. 

I'm excited about this quiz though I definitely going to do it bc I need him to be a little more adventurous."

sexover30,f9jny9u,t3_e58scb,1575381083.0,Same. Grew up with only men in my life and always had boy friends. Problem for me is I also married a prude. I know he's not but once we had kids pretty much when we met he changed to wanting to be nurturing and gentle. No! I am a dirty little slut and you should treat me as such damnit! If I try to bring it up to girlfriend they get weird. I'm not sure if they have different desires and it is embarrassing to them or they are just dead inside. It's sex! You're supposed to explore and keep it interesting.
MarriedSex,f9f4c0v,t1_f9f2fg6,1575259212.0,Well I'm a mom of two young kids so I understand days where you just can not compartmentalize. Sex helps though especially after kids which is the crazier thing. It helps you feel connected to yourself and your partner.

I've brought up specific desires many times and nothing. 

Nope I don't think there's a winning here. Either compatible sexually or not I suppose but it's so hard to find."
depression,f9evirc,t1_f9eu178,1575252666.0,Weed definitely helps. I've been depressed the majority of my life but the fast push into sexuality at 7 could subconsciously be the root cause and/or attraction to sex. Although I've done the years of therapy for that and other traumas. It is just the only time things feel right. Nothing else going on in my head. It's so quiet and secure to feel connected to someone.
