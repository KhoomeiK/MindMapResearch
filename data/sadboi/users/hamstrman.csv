If someone's post is nothing but ASL, complaining how no one is going to respond, that's sad and is the reason why women don't message them. But if you put in effort and are sincere, it's a place with great promise.

AskReddit,fksyx0c,t3_fk3dzd,1584501749.0,"I'm 35 male. Lost my virginity December of last year! 

I spent my entire life thinking no one would ever want to be with me to the point that I realize, in hindsight, I rejected advances from more than one female friend when I was actually of dating age. They slowly stopped being friends each time. It got to the point that, if I had a chance of getting a girlfriend before, I definitely didn't now! I kissed one girl when I was 18. Never dated, no relationships.

It wasn't until May 2019, that I got to a point in my life where I could accept someone in this world might enjoy my company. I had resigned myself to never having sex and sought out a cuddle buddy initially, on reddit. After six months neither finding anyone to simply watch TV with nor date, my now-girlfriend messaged me, concerned that she was too young and didn't live in NYC like me. 

I was concerned that I was way too OLD for anyone! I accepted our distance, shortly after getting to know her. We met a month later, in December, because we felt like we knew each other forever. It's still odd how much more perfect we are for each other than we had even realized. As such, we quite unexpectedly ended up having sex the night we met... üò≥

I thought it was a disaster, she thought it was great. I had been having performance issues because of anxiety and medications. She didn't care. She said she would've stayed with me even if things never improved. That was such a relief that she had patience and since then, I've been able to relax and enjoy sex. 

TL;DR - I'm 35/M, lost my virginity in the last 6 months to someone I care deeply about, who replied to my post on reddit. We had sex the day we met. She helped me get past my performance problems and I hope we're together forever. I'm not well suited to many people in this world, but we're perfect for each other in every regard."
