I have been having ERP therapy for OCD for a few weeks and it has been super helpful - it's definitely a tricky illness to have but it's recoverable!

Anxiety,foq763p,t3_g8v0l8,1587985415.0,Yeah i totally feel this way. I was working a very stressful hospitality job and I've loved not having to go in to work and not have to deal with all of the awful anxiety that ensues. I really don't want to ever go back to that job  even though I do miss aspects of life pre-lockdown
zpaletteporn,fo0fw33,t3_g4z13t,1587412395.0,Memories!!! I reported this Palette too about a year ago but have since decluttered the shades as they had gotten too old and dusty to use. Do you find that yours still work ok?
BeautyGuruChatter,fno7uvn,t1_fno775d,1587115386.0,I'm literally the same! I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you and hoping you can get everything sorted out ok!!  I'm in the UK so have applied for UC but it's such a stressful process having to try and answer questions and have long phone calls and obviously the system is overwhelmed so everything is taking so much longer than it would do. Same here - like I've seen so many YouTubers bitching about a slight dip in their (let's face it already pretty comfortable) income and I'm like... Ok there are loads of people who would give anything to have ANY kind of income right now! YouTube is still running fine they are still able to make videos but damn it's not enough for some people. Like you said we don't need the underhanded guilt trip. I feel like some of these people really need a huuuuge reality check.
BeautyGuruChatter,fno0hkw,t1_fnniaea,1587107666.0,"Sorry to hear! I'm in the exact same position. I haven't lost a few subscribers, ive lost my job and my income. Im totally kn the same boat as you and hope you're doing ok. I feel like saying to these YouTubers 'ok imagine if you loose *all* your subs and viewers overnight and don't even know how to begin getting them back again'. It seems in such poor taste to complain about a slight drop in income when millions of people around the world have completely lost their source of income"
BeautyGuruChatter,fnmizwu,t1_fnmimum,1587072287.0,Exactly! I HATE it when YouTubers/instagrammers complain TO their viewers/followers about low views. Like seriously??? A) complaining TO YOUR VIEWERS about your viewers not doing enough probably isn't a great idea and b) honey we don't owe you shit. If we don't want to watch them we won't. Most of us have bigger fish to fry.

But damn I'd trade for getting to sit in my room all day talking about makeup so i didn't have to go and clean toilets and pour coffee for rude people and wipe shit off the floors. Not that I can even do any of that stuff anymore. Maybe she's not meaning to complain (I don't know her and haven't ever watched her) but this comes across as 'guysssss my views have gone down so go and watch more stuff even if you don't want to cause I want some more money"""

MakeupRehab,fhpoopq,t1_fhpmzwt,1581793167.0,I totally get that - some of the products are uncommon & I totally think that having people on hand to chat and explain things is a good idea . I just hate the feeling of being hounded from the second I walk in. I always try and shake then off with a 'no thanks I'm just browsing!' but they watch me like hawks and the second I get rid of one salesperson another leaps in to give the hard sell. I find it pretty unethical which is a shame because I really love some of their ethics. I don't think I'd mind them so much if they actually listened when I said I was fine shopping on my own - I think it's the persistence I find irritating most of all
MakeupRehab,fhpg3in,t3_f4bgw6,1581788797.0,"I find their sales tactics really exploitative and manipulative and for that reason I don't ever buy anything from them haha 
It's weird because I agree with loads of their ethics but jumping on people as soon as they walk through the door and exploiting people's politeness to get them.to.buy waaay more than they intend really leaves a bad taste in mouth.

Don't let people tell you horror stories , talk about it in detail with your doctor, research, understand that nothing is a quick fix but also understand that some people have a chemical imbalance and medication is sometimes needed to address that imbalance. If you were anemic people would tell you to take iron tablets. They probably would say ""watch out - those iron tablets will change who you are!""
