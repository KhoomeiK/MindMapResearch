The chance you three are all in a room and don‚Äôt have the same birthday is (364/365)x(363/365). For every additional person you‚Äôre gonna go down one.

Pay attention to the topics and narratives that make it to air. If we lived in the early ‚Äò90s, for instance, we wouldn‚Äôt think twice about a conversation coming up about a housemate with AIDS. That was a really prominent social anxiety. But that‚Äôs rarely addressed in reality TV today. Compare that, say, to the narrative on Survivor more recently of a trans man being outed at tribal council. Or even more recently, of CBS ejecting a male Survivor cast member for too familiarly touching female cast members. Those would have been strange to audiences in the 1990s. Were those people chosen for the anxieties they‚Äôd raise? Definitely. Were those narratives encouraged or edited in a certain way? Of course. Reality TV is not reality in its entirety for that reason. But the anxieties that are shown are definitely reflective of the times."

Her biological clock is running out, she found a man she would trust to have a baby with, and she sees long term love in her future with him. I don‚Äôt know if she loved him yet.
