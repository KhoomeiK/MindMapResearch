Pot will only mute your thoughts for awhile, imo. Then when you sober up, at least for me, functioning was fine. The damage comes from chronique use and/also very strong weed. But still, nothing compared to meth, heroin and coke."

I am serious in the sense meth definitely does damage. Internally. I didn’t fact-check my comment, but the effects of meth are irreversible. Talk to my ex. I mean, people can get clean after meth, but unless they did very little or have the genes to protect against irreversible damage, brain chemistry will be wack (off) for a bit. My ex did meth and heroin, his teeth are/were veneers and his crazy mood-swings either pre-date or are a result of the meth habit, but trust me, it doesn’t help.

Like do you seriously think your poop just floats away to magic la-la land to never be seen again? It’s treated in the sewage plant, and then that same water is put back into the system.

Fyi washers do need to be periodically cleaned, but honestly you need to consider how people lived before this terrible “convenience “ culture of disposable everything that’s ruining our planet.

I’m sorry but you sound neurotic and hypochondriac thinking you’ll have “poop” on your clothes if you use re-usable tp. It’s almost always pre-washed and soaked in a special soap (like oxyclean) before being run on HOT and ideally run through a vinegar/baking soda rinse cycle."
