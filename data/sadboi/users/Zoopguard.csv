One night, I was in my feelings.  We were in his car, on the road to a nearby city...  I went for it, gambled on our familiarity over the years, wasn't caring about keeping those intense feelings and fears inside - didn't want to.

For me, what I essentially shitposted was relationships-based.  Fears, doubts, disbelief... years' worth.

I got lucky, incredibly so.  In a few long conversations both to and from the city, he gently advised me on this and that.  The words are things I'm still meditating on, practicing.

To keep this from becoming more of an epic, trust has to be there, that what you share will be confidential.  It goes the other way - don't publish the close things you get the privilege to hear and/or see.  Time, in which you both establish that indeed, you keep your promise to be mum.  These two elements depend on each other, make it possible to get quite vulnerable, if not outright intimate.
