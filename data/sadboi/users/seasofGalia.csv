Like, my restricting occurs across manic, hypo, depressed, and stable mood states, and I also have an extreme focus on achieving *that perfect weight.* But disordered eating can be a huge problem, even if it‚Äôs not an eating disorder, and it‚Äôs definitely worth getting therapy for if you think it‚Äôs an issue‚Äîdefinitely mention it to your pdoc. 

My ED started from getting made fun of for my weight all throughout childhood by peers, my parents, and then a gf. So once I hit college, I started eating 600 Calories per day trying to hit my goal weight, which I thought would somehow make my life better. Turns out, it didn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm still fucking trying, even with therapy and a dietician. 

And that‚Äôs the 36,000-foot view of an ed, trying not to trigger anyone."
