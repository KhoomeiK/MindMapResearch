But I have that same face and square physicality already.  Wouldn't take much, read hours of gym work, to get me there with T help.  I already love lifting but I gave it up for a while because of a few life reasons.  Now that I'm on T my ass is getting back to lifting.

I mean transition goals can be health or toxic.  Can't control people's expectations."

 And yeah it's a bit antiquated. Maybe it's cause I live in the south?  Who knows."
ftm,f1fo1em,t1_f1fnl80,1569448795.0,So back story. My natural hair color is honey blonde that I loathe and dye crazy colors.  I also have the pale skin to match. I can count at least a dozen times in my life where I've been equated with a porcelain doll for that reason.  *Shudders* it affects me even more now that I recently figured out I'm trans this past summer and pre-T. Some people don't know when to shut up.  That was dysphoria hell for 3 days.
ftm,f1fmv7z,t1_f1fmqs7,1569448001.0,Yeah I got called beautiful/a porcelain doll a few weeks ago.  Just shoot me.  Masculine beauty is a thing.  Whatever. But that porcelain doll comment.  I wanted to die.

Just from conversations I had gotten used to most of the vernacular, but once I got there I was still hit was a few things.  Biggest one was hearing cunt used as everyday language.  Doesn't bother me so I was amused.  But for a lot of people in the States that's beyond horrific and vulgar.  

It also threw me off when one of his friends asked me when she was gonna see me get pissed.  Pissed? Why do you want to see me get pissed??? He leaned over and said drunk love, drunk. Ooohh, duh. Later.

Same language, different meaning."

Beyond the usual sex and  unlevel washing machine, my current neighbor has a toddler. When she runs around it sounds like a heard of small cattle. I think she plays with beads cause those roll around a lot. Oh and moving furniture is a fun past time. I've gotten mostly used to it, but there are days I question if bowling is on her list of activities."

I went through a rough two years and put back on a lot of weight that I have to take off again.  But I did realize that the gender dysmorphia was worse the thinner I got because I started looking physically more feminine.  I hated it. Also, unfortunately I suffer from ""should have by now"" on a lot of aspects of my life. So that's nothing new. 

Let me know if you need any lifting tips.  I can point you to resources."
