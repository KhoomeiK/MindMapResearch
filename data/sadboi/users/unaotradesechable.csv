That being said, if you really don't want a baby, you should be using both bc and condoms. Condoms break, sometimes if you're sleeping with a shitty person (which he sounds like) they take them off or break them during sex, and you might not notice until later, then they'd claim it as an accident. There might be affordable birth control programs, please do a Google search in your area. 

**TLDR: it's a bullshit excuse. Don't expose yourself. Use two birth control methods if you really want to avoid kids. Look into affordable birth control.**"
AmItheAsshole,fq8bbcl,t3_ghc1bw,1589162348.0,INFO I don't actually see any examples here of her ever being dismissive of her children's gifts. I hear what you're saying but I don't think the way she feels about getting gifts from you is related to the disappointment she feels that her kids didn't want to make cards for her.

AskAnEscort,fq72fwm,t3_gh1pzx,1589140919.0,"That's her job. If you want to set boundaries for what you think is ok to do you can discuss that with her, but at the end of the day you don't get to decide for her. If she makes a decision you don't agree with her, you wouldn't be an asshole for moving on, you're not obligated to be with her. You need to seriously think about whether you're really comfortable with her job and talk to her about your concerns.


Because of the interface nature of our jobs, often times client relationships can exceed normal work life boundaries. If you're not comfortable with that you need to speak up or move on. If the situation is truly as you described, I can completely understand your discomfort."
AmItheAsshole,fq6o3lj,t3_ggy0qk,1589135264.0,"He might be a hypocrite or he might be trying to prevent you from becoming a him like him. Weed is great and all, but it isn't harmless. And it's really ready to fall into a bad habit, where it would affect your ability to hold a job, or stay focused on school, or to feel motivated to do anything.

So while he might be a hypocrite, he still had much mid experience with weed than you, so you should listen to him and be careful, so you don't end up like him. It's much easier to become addicted to weed than you think, especially during stressful times.

You'll think you're smoking moderately, until one day you're not."

AmItheAsshole,fq66laz,t3_ggt8q3,1589125539.0,"Your son has some problems. I know he's your son and I know that you love him but that doesn't mean he doesn't have some problems. He rejects girls when they're not perfect, and he doesn't understand that no means no. Do you really feel right sending him to get married when he doesn't understand the word no? You know what kind of husband he's going to become right? The abusive one. Are you ok with having an abusive son or are you going to do something about it?"
AmItheAsshole,fq65tp5,t1_fq538uo,1589125096.0,That's pretty fucked up. I hope you're ok
AmItheAsshole,fq64fyn,t3_ggjtpx,1589124290.0,"She clearly had a lot of traffickers sexist views about what a man can or can't do. Do you want to fight about them for the rest of your life? If you want children, do you want some and daughters who are constable being themselves even if they don't follow retributive gender roles? This argument is only going to come up again and again. 

Calling you gay because you suggested she propose to you or that you want a ring is simply wrong, and very rude. please don't ignore it, because it says a lot about her beliefs about what men can and can't do.
