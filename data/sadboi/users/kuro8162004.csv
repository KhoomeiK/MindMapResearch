AskReddit,fr4bzjx,t3_gmif44,1589883205.0,"Only listen to people who matter to you. Take advice only from those you trust; and never let society pressure you into anything you don't want to do.
If you feel unloved, wait, and the right people will come into your life.
As long as you're healthy, your body is perfect. And on that note, nothing and nobody can be perfect because everyone's idea of Perfect is different. 
Live your life for yourself, and nobody else. If someone wants you to change who you are for their satisfaction and enjoyment, they aren't a real friend.
But if many people see something bad that you're doing; accept that you're doing it and take action. Mistakes and failures are all stepping stones to being the best person you can be, and you will always grow more and more every day."

We were friends for a while, and he let me into a Discord server with just him and his girldriend, which was kinda iffy considering the kinda person he was, but I accepted it. After all, he was autistic like me! And there's no bad Autistic people, right? WRONG!

Once he got comfortable enough with me, he started to show off art that had a specific theme to it; Diapers. His Baby self-insert Mario OC sh■tting and p■ssing and Touching himself in diapers. He's drawn that character being vored by and having sex with his imaginary Flower girlfriend too, which was just shocking considering that this was in a small server with Him, Me, and his Real life girlfriend?? I didn't understand it one bit. And he was obsessed with the imaginary vore flower. He tried to tell me that this crap was normal, and that grown-ups and kiddies doing stuff to eachother was normal.
By the way, he'd ""age regress"" and sh■t on the table in Video Calls with his girlfriend. WhaT THE F■CK?!?!!! And he called this a coping method because of childhood trauma, which was because his dad was a pedophile apperantly.
I kinda don't believe that though because that's like if I coped with my trauma from that foster home I was in a while back by acting like my foster parents..

At age 14, I put together some mental puzzle-pieces, and realized his intentions.
I serverely overreacted which caused him to act like a baby about it, and we both started being really immature. I lost a bunch of friends (they were jerks who stuck with me just to look cool for having an autistic friend, I'm glad they're gone) and I almost let him manipulate me into Lying that he wasn't a pedophile to save his Tumblr reputation.

The Government would be too Lazy to try to take people's money or encourage Reproduction, so people would start dying off and society would be equal, No poor or rich unless someone couldn't get a Job.

People would be so afraid to get the Stomach Flu, that whenever one started going around it'd be all over the news, and it would become a Pandemic. As soon as a Vaccine was released, they'd be given out for Free.

Cuddling and Friendship would be the new Social norm, while Sex and Romance would be Highly frowned apon; it would be seen as gross and Uncalled-for behavior, and people would get even Bullied for it.

Autism would be a regular thing to have, and if anyone happened to be Neurotypical, they'd be made fun of, or treated like Aliens. Alot of people would be kind and understanding about it too, though.

Instead of Jail, The punishment for Crimes would be listening to Modern Pop music, being forced to watch Live Action movies featuring mainly humans, and having to eat various things with Onions in them. That being said, Onions and Celery would be present in almost nothing, and would be only grown for the purpose of Tormenting others. If Pedophilia were to be present in a criminal, there would be a Death Sentence.

Robots would be more present in the world, and Sentient Robots would exist to simply live as a functional member of Society, and would also be treated as such;
Some Robots would also be for Therapy or comfort aswell!
