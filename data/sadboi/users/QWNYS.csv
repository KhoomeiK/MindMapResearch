depression,f067wpr,t3_d3mqe2,1568431468.0,"I feel the same way. I know I need help. No one wants to help. I come from a home were depression isn't accepted. Everyone always tells me ""stop being so childish you can be crying over everything"" or ""start behaving like an adult"" or some crap like that. I want to end it so badly. I just haven't found how to. I have no friends just internet friends and I know if I talk to them I'll scare them off. And I don't know how to feel 'okay'."

NuclearRevenge,ezwz9z4,t3_cbfgav,1568228492.0,"I wish I was clever enough to do this.
I was engaged, we were going to move in together, but I found out he cheated. 
There were several things I wish I could've done. Right now he currently left so he can date a high schooler.. he's 20. I wish I could do something but I'll just leave it up to karma. I could never come up with such elaborate plan

Anyhow, man you are a genius!! Props to you!"
