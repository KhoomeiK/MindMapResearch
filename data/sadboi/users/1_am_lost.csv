She’s since passed, and I wish she would’ve chosen to go to therapy and got on some medicine like I did. She could’ve had a much more stable life. I understand her pain and inner turmoil.

I took a left turn and didn’t look back for about 30 seconds. When I finally did look back, he was gone. Perhaps he had darted of into somebody’s yard. Maybe he was planning on robbing me, or worse.
