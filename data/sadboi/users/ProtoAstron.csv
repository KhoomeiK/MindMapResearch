AskReddit,fckkjpv,t1_fci1bj0,1577727339.0,/r/Petioles/ is a subreddit that deals with the healthy consumption of cannabis. A petiole is the part of the plant the sits between the leaf and the stem. So the subreddit's name implies it is designed for people people who don't want to commit fully to /r/Leaves. It is a supportive sub and users tend to speak fairly objectively about the problems weed can cause.

The water floods into the cells via osmosis to try and balance things out, which can lead to complications. [Hyponatremia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia) can also occur from drinking too much where the sodium levels in the blood are reduced."

cscareerquestionsEU,eoyy2a7,t1_eoujo4t,1558948693.0,"I did an access course in computing. They are part-time (normally 3 days a week) and only last year, so finding part-time work is possible while you study. You can pay for them using an advanced learner loan which means the course is free if you then go on to complete a degree. 



It is possible to survive while at uni just on the maintenance loan given but you will have to live very frugally. The student loans debt is also paid back based on your pay (9% over £21k).

That being said if you can get into the industry without going to uni then do it by all means. You can make money while you learn and rack up less debt. I think it just requires more self-study."
