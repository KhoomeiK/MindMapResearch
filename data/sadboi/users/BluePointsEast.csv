TrueAskReddit,fjzcbx2,t3_ffivmn,1583716389.0,"I’m a high school student. 

I would like to see education tailored more to the interests of students. A typical school holds to a “one size fits all” mentality. This doesn’t make sense, considering that every student is unique in their interests and attributes. I think that every student should be allowed to have a say in what courses they take. For example, a student interested in science would need to take higher math, science classes, English in order to effectively communicate, and then more specialized classes later on that fit with their field of interest, if they know what they want to pursue later on, whereas a student interested in visual wouldn’t need to take higher math or advanced sciences, and could instead take art classes to gain more experience and hours of work, and build a portfolio. There would obviously need to be a baseline for all students, since some skills are necessary for all to learn, but I think that schools could do much more to accommodate students’ areas of interest and skill. 

TL;DR: Schools should allow students to pursue their interests, giving them the opportunity to take classes tailored to what they intend to pursue later in life."
