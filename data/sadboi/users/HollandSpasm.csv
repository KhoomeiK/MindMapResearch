mentalhealth,fq8g4z8,t1_fq740ir,1589165438.0,"From Ireland too and I totally resonate with your pain. If I could I would hug you. Just remember to mind yourself. With my experience, I've found neglect of one's mental health or any sort of health can happen over this. Also, grieving the loss can be therapeutic even though incredibly saddening. In the end, I feel it's best to know the truth and be able to move on properly, than deal with a relationship you may have considered ""normal"" at one point. Keep strong <3"

On a side note, I would recommend talking to a friend or seeking counseling. Also, there's this helpful lady called Esther Peril who has very interesting views on cheating and infidelity. I would recommend her TedTalk videos on YouTube. Please think before acting, and try and process this. He isn't right for doing this however the reason could be an underlying issue. If you feel the relationship is worth saving, the work through it."
raisedbynarcissists,faowurq,t1_fantjzf,1576274413.0,"That's very emotional aware and mature of you to realise. A lot of people don't care and would be selfish, end up having kids anyway."
raisedbynarcissists,fak60js,t1_fak5955,1576161525.0,"Thank you. This has cleared some thoughts I had. Fleas is a good word for it. It is half the battle knowing, I think I'm stuck/slow on the creating better habits. I do tend to play video games (escapism) however I don't as much anymore. I've been reading a lot of self help books and other books about being better in general. They have helped either enlighten certain things I didn't know about myself.

The defensive thing I get actually. I'm an only child which means a lot of the focus was on me growing up, warranted or not. My mom would boost about me (sports) and then if I didn't reach a specific criteria, she'd criticise me. Over the years I dealt with it not so bad. However recently, after being away for past 3 years for college.. I've found it difficult to get used to her again. So my natural reactions to defend myself have turned almost self defensive even when she might not be giving out, I expect it.

I know it will take years and your comments, give me hope for the future. I'm happy you're much healthier and have dealt with it."
raisedbynarcissists,fak36b5,t1_fak2ncv,1576160017.0,I appreciate this a lot. Makes me feel better. Self awareness is great... It just also means crippling overthinking about it - for me anyway. Which means I always worry it might happen. I guess it's possible we pick up some of the tendencies or habits they've had?
raisedbynarcissists,fak15hx,t1_faj6n6d,1576158898.0,"Yeah I feel I'll be the same. It's good that you have loving parents to refer back to, it gives you a guideline."
raisedbynarcissists,fak12ed,t1_faj7ffi,1576158851.0,"Yeah exactly this! I feel the same. It's so difficult, it like you can't trust yourself. You can't trust that you're ok and not just overthinking. I genuinely feel it hurts our sense of self an awful lot, constantly second guessing if you're being an asshole or just have a legitimate reason for feeling or doing something.

I also find that I can't simple have a 'normal' mood swing or off day without fearing I'm turning into a monster. It's confusing. 

I will use that quote too, thank you so much for it. I hope we both heal fully from this."
raisedbynarcissists,faj4q1c,t1_faj4e7k,1576124421.0,"Yeah I agree. That's a good solution. Just remember don't beat yourself up too much if things don't go to plan or you mess up. I'm sure because of the awareness on both you and your SOs part, will help give any child a good upbringing. Trust and communication are HUGE. So underestimated by so many people it baffles me almost."
raisedbynarcissists,faj48sh,t1_faj3qcz,1576124033.0,"Selfish. That's the word alright. I'm the same, you feel you're putting other person out by asking for your needs, that you don't deserve them etc. I wish we could just relax and grow... But because of what we've gone through we can't do that. We have to love ourselves first, which is easier said than done."
raisedbynarcissists,faj43c3,t1_faj3n0a,1576123910.0,"I appreciate that sentiment. Yeah I look forward to doing the same one day, I just need to be more independent - money and car. I'm glad you got away from all that."
raisedbynarcissists,faj40tw,t1_faj35vd,1576123854.0,"Yeah I'm in same boat. I'd love to have a kid but what if I act the way she acted with me? Will I harm it in another way, a way she didn't but just as bad? Will I even notice? It's all these questions that come up. Super scary."
lonely,fa9aon5,t3_e4cbl7,1575867097.0,"I actually came across this post by looking online for threads about having a hole in near the heart area (emotional). I'm so sorry you feel the way you do, it sucks balls.

I have to agree with other comment, your writing skills and ways of expressing yourself is very good. Genuinely should consider writing as a hobby or profession.

At the age of 15, I can assure you with your self awareness and overall want to be better, you will get better - as a person, at education (not necessarily school) and at life. Self awareness and self reflection help urge you forward towards a path that'll be ultimately good.

Friendships are more difficult than what they seem on the surface. Not all friendships are good. You're in a situation where you can improve as a friend and also choose what type of friends you want. Look at this as an opportunity to cultivate meaningful friendships. 

Just be yourself, less selfish obviously, but yourself none-the-less. Asking questions about their life's and what they enjoy/like is a good way for people to like you. Another tip for friends, is to not overload new friends with too much info or ""emotional baggage"" onto them. People usually dislike that and feel awkward. Just smile, be curious, and try your best to think positively about people/potential friends. If they sense you like them, they will like you -people tend to like those who like them.

With life, it's always changing. That's the only constant; change. Which means nobody at any given point truly knows what's going to happen and how life will turn out for them. You're still young and by the looks of it, quite mature for your age. Don't put yourself down, you're worth a lot more than you think. Believe in yourself. School doesn't define you. Your parents expectations don't. It's your actions that count. Take action... Even if it means eating less junk food or going outside for 5 minutes, I can assure you it will be better.

To end it, I'll speak about this with the hole in the heart - it'll take some time, a lot of self improvement and mental energy to address the deep issues as to why you have it. For me, I know it's mainly to do with one parent/ th death of a family member. At one point I managed to get rid of it completely, which is crazy since I had it for most of my life. 

So it's definitely possible for it to heal and be better. Meditation, journaling, talking (online or in person), listening to music... All these things help. I also play video games, even though it helps, it can also hinder your growth. Getting lost in a fictional world can do that to you. Hope I helped. Keep smiling and keep strong x"
Advice,f9ithql,t3_e4yhrx,1575345597.0,"I'm incredibly sorry to hear about your situation. I just thought the other day about December (Christmas) being a miserable month for certain people. 

As many other comments said, I'd recommend reaching out to a local shelter for support. They'll offer services to help or at least an understanding perspective which will make you feel less alone. Having loved ones who've died is a horrible thing to get over, and it will be a long while till you'll feel good.

I promise though. I promise that things will get better. They always do. When you're at your lowest, the only way is up. Keep strong, with the love for yourself and those who you love/loved. Don't be afraid to ask for help. I'm happy you felt you could reach out here... You can always reach out here. Hit me up in the DMs if you want to vent or want advice or just simply to converse. I wish you the best."

relationship_advice,f7mtd0y,t1_f7msusz,1573873119.0,"You may be right. It's just recently I've been obsessing over this insecurity. To the point were I try to snap myself out of it but end up thinking about it again or searching up about it or essentially feeding the mind with more information to overthink with. 

The last few days I've gone back to journalling. Which has helped. However when I do this, it's usually a sign I'm in bad shape. 

I just hate being like this. I am putting pressure on myself.. I think it's mainly because I want to grow and be the best version of myself."
relationship_advice,f7mp91r,t1_f7moz91,1573869660.0,"No it's not unhelpful. I highly recommend therapy too. I went to several sessions in college and that changed my life in many aspects. I'm much healthier thinking - except obviously this insecurity I carry. I know why I have it, I'm always aware when it crops up it's ugly head. I've worked hard to be aware of my flaws and to deal with them.

I guess I'm struggling too much on my own. I do need therapy. Unfortunately at the moment, there's issue of transport and money. However I haven't looked into it for a while. Thanks for reminding me. You have helped."
raisedbynarcissists,f62v8us,t1_f62303h,1572667623.0,"Thank you, I appreciate the advice"
raisedbynarcissists,f618zzg,t3_dpzgda,1572635770.0,"I wish I could hug you. I relate to that feeling a lot. There's another phrase that riles me up too..

""Your mom wants what's best for you"" ""you should be grateful for having such a loving mom""

If only they knew or understood that not all parents truly love their children, the love and attention is all in relation to them. The thought of someone growing up and being independent crushes them. They try their best to squash it."
