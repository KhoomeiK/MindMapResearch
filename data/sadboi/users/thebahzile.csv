AskReddit,foydnol,t3_ga4gjx,1588170610.0,"This happened shortly after my best friend took her own life. 

I was hanging out with two friends underneath an outdoor awning that was probably about 15 ft high. We were smoking cigarettes and joking around, hanging out, and sober. A small transparent shape about the size of a fist fell from the top of the awning. It passed THROUGH my hair and disappeared before it hit the ground. It felt like someone had literally stroked my hair. I stood speechless for a moment as my two friends exclaimed at what they saw. We all started looking on the ground, in some nearby bushes, but there was nothing there. We even started looking in my (rather large) mop of hair. 

We never found anything and went on with our night. A day later, both friends individually texted me to tell me how they are convinced it was my best friend who passed away. 

I didnâ€™t want to say anything that night, but I also think it was my friend. Her favorite physical feature of mine in life, was my hair, she was always touching it. Why would it be any different in death?"

All my earthly senses slowly faded away. There was no panic, it was like falling into the most peaceful sleep. 

Once I was in the darkness an organic machine slowly appeared. It was moving and not moving at the same time. It was all of the colors and no colors at once. I was traveling through it. I didnâ€™t even need to move because there was a force pulling me through. 

I ended up in a still, black lake. I had the strongest sensation that I had been there many times before. I also remember thinking â€˜this is it, this is where everyone is always trying to get back to.â€™ I was surrounded by other souls. It felt like I spent an eternity there, floating in the peaceful darkness. 

A great light that I thought to be an angel was approaching and I knew it was for me. As I was being pulled out of the lake I started to hear a baby cry from very far away. I knew I was going to be reborn. The crying got closer and closer until I finally opened my eyes in this physical realm and I realized, I was the baby crying."

Often I just take things day by day and try to do the best I can for the circumstances. If I have the flu, the best thing I can do is lay in bed all day. If I have to work, the best thing I can do is have a good attitude about it. If Iâ€™m with friends, the best thing I can do is just enjoy myself and be present.
