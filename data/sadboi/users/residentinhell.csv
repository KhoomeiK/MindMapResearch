My parents think therapy is a financial scam and that the cure for depression lies and *only* lies in the gospel and living a healthy lifestyle—the latter may have some degree of truth but I’ve tried and it doesn’t fucking fix the problem for me. Even after I’ve begged for help, even after my parents watched and yelled at me while I was having convulsions on the floor during a panic attack and unable to breathe, they refuse to budge and assume that I’m actually fine and it’s just a phase. Damn I’m ranting here but the church is fucking abusive and I just had to get that off of my chest."
exmormon,fq8u117,t3_gh9adv,1589175506.0,"Oh god I remember filling this thing out in my first year of seminary. I was pretty TBM at the time but like any freshman ever I did stuff I ""wasn't supposed to"" and filling this out gave me a small panic attack when I saw what I was supposed to be doing. Instead of focusing on the talents and skills I actually had, I felt like a worthless person because I couldn't put a 5 on most of these."

The first crack on my shelf came when I saw what temple clothing looked like and I was like “wait no, the church I know isn’t like *that*!” I just couldn’t look at all the adults in my ward the same way because I’d think of them all wearing those silly hats and aprons and I’d start laughing."
exmormon,fpu0sut,t1_fptzb25,1588902242.0,"That’s cause they changed it in 1990. Before then, in the prayer circles you would raise your hand and repeat “pay lay ale,” which is apparently in the language that Adam spoke in the garden of eden or some shit. Now you say “oh god, hear the words of my mouth” which is supposed to be a translated version of pay lay ale. Don’t know why they changed it, maybe sky daddy was pissed that we knew some of his super secret heaven speak?"

The only problem is that it's outdated so it doesn't cover much of final arc Eren, but much of what is discussed in the video can be applied to how Eren acts now."
bisexual,fnribon,t3_g3ik5r,1587189835.0,"I think more people are understanding that it's a legitimate sexuality, separate from gay or straight. And yeah, the world is becoming more LGBT+ in general. For example, I'm in hs right now and there is a significant LGBT+ student population in my school who are more or less treated the same as other students.

exmormon,fng30gz,t3_g1gtki,1586921127.0,"Swearing is so weird lol. They are just fucking words, yet the TBM’s treat it like saying them automatically earns them a sin. Why would God be so concerned over a few very contemporary English words?"
saltierthancrait,fneytea,t3_g18fjr,1586898338.0,"This perfectly summarizes why the prequel trilogy had so much better of an impact on SW that the sequels. Heck, almost half of the SW lore comes from these movies, and the aesthetic of the prequels became a mainstay in the EU and the franchise in general. And of course that’s not even considering the fact that the prequels spawned the clone wars, which is the absolute peak of Star Wars imo."
titanfolk,fnakdja,t3_g0h1jq,1586799013.0,"Yes, manga > anime imo. And if you do start reading, I would recommend reading the whole thing from chapter 1. The uprising arc (season 3 part 1) had a lot of things cut from the manga, leaving out pieces of character development, especially for Levi, Historia, and Erwin. Also, Grisha and Kruger’s conversation at the end of season 3 was condensed, leading to some key information about Marley being cut. To get the full story you need to read through the whole manga."

The inconsistencies of the teachings of “god.” The actions of general authorities.

Eren winning makes the most sense given the current situation. It also fits the themes of snk and would end the series on a tragic note, which is what I think suits this series the most. However, if Isayama could execute it well, I could accept an alternative ending to the series because I understand that the series ending not how I want it to does not automatically make the ending bad."
