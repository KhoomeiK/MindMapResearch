After a breakup with the most wonderful man I’ve ever known and the only person I’ve ever felt truly loved by (down to his gentleness and reasons for the breakup), I was starting to doubt this. I’m so happy to see that it exists. Thank you for sharing ."

BPD,eztr4db,t1_ezs13tq,1568136761.0,"I’m not sure what state you live in, but I tried a couple CA zip codes (not where I live) and it gave me therapists when I searched “Therapy and Counseling” 

If you can’t find anything, I would try better help and asking your insurance if they have out of network benefits so they can help cover the cost. Therapy is important my friend, and there are many options available."

BPD,eywuxc2,t3_cz7fiz,1567538475.0,"Lol me 
When I’m really going through it, I tell all my business to all these strangers (thinking that they’ll not care anyways and I don’t have to see them ever again), and I usually get a really nice venting session out of it, but I try not to take too much stock into what they say. 

I actually made one of my (now) closest friends that way, and she calls me out when I’m just seeking validation or I’m starting to split. So sometimes oversharing isn’t so bad"
BPD,eywupvg,t1_eywd35n,1567538341.0,"It’s a website where you can find local services for a variety of things. I searched DBT on Therapists/Counselors and their prices were posted, as well as an overview of their services. If they’re really good, they’ll do a phone intake and that’s where you can ask if they teach DBT because you’re having Borderline Symptoms (if you haven’t been officially diagnosed) . Then you get to find the right therapist for you. I posted the link for the app below!

Only snag with this is that my ex caught on and he was really avid about fixing the situation instead of an imagined solution of sex. He was  real smart. Couldn’t seduce him. That was a bummer 

It also didn’t help he was super hot. But whatever. A vibrator will do for the time being."
BPD,eyv0zpn,t3_cywqda,1567477500.0,"Have you considered that you may be heading into avoiding imagined abandonment? Like... trying to cut him off before he abandons you?

I read into things like this all the time, and I try to be as gentle as I can be about it, but I have to understand my feelings lie to me sometimes. 

With BPD, we sometimes have a higher desire for sex as this can be a coping mechanism. I myself have had this problem. So maybe he was actually just tired? 

He may just need a little space as well. I know I smothered my boyfriend and that pushed him away. I do my best to respect his space now but it’s still hard for me. 

I’m not saying this fits your situation exactly, just some food for thought."
BPD,eyv0kjj,t3_cyurlj,1567477165.0,"Pick up a DBT workbook and start there. Meditating (loving kindness specifically) also helps. There was a wait at the therapist I picked first and then I searched for therapists using thumbtack and I had a session two days later. 

You’ll get through this. You are not your intense ups and downs. You are a beautiful person with complicated emotions. And you’ll figure it out. It’s gonna be okay ♥️"
BPD,eyuzotq,t3_cyvnxo,1567476468.0,"Have you asked your doctor about mood stabilizers? They’ve helped me a lot. 

Also, in my really intense moments I’ll play my own devils advocate and ask myself “do I actually want to die?” And if the answer is no, I go on to “okay, do I want to live?” Then it goes on to “who else wants to see me live, why have they said my existence is important to them, could that be true, etc.” 

When I have a snap episode, I call someone I know who is awake. I have my 5 friends that I know at least *one* will pick up /text back dependent on their working hours. 

So those are the tools I usually have in my back pocket. I hope you feel better ♥️

Edit: I’m a female and haven’t been officially diagnosed, but insisted on finding a therapist that treats BPD symptoms (which she doesn’t refute That I have) and uses DBT, and she is AWESOME so far."
BPD,eyuzdoy,t3_cyxjy6,1567476222.0,"All the time. It could be the simplest thing like “oh, I don’t want to come over” or just something small that may have been the slightest bit thoughtless and I’ll start sobbing. I wish I could stop it. But you’re not alone."
BPD,eym490b,t3_cxj0m4,1567199086.0,"Only advice I have is that the more you depend on him, the more emotionally exhausted he’ll become. So if you’re codependent and still having trouble regulating emotions, GET. HELP. NOW.
My ex and I cared very much for each other but I couldn’t control my emotions, and he took it upon himself to be my punching bad, saying nothing about how it was affecting him in the process, thus leaving him emotionally drained, and thus, no longer being emotionally invested. Thankfully, we’re still able to be great friends because we did care for eachother, but I have no expectations of the future, my only focus is g e t t i n g  b e t t e r. 

Yes, our condition SUCKS, but we have a responsibility to at least try and understand how to be actual people, who can reasonably muddle through and articulate our feelings without expecting our partner to take the brunt of them or being entirely dependent on their approval to be happy. My advice? Take some time to be the person you always wanted to be (or do everything you can to get close) first. Then you realize that you CAN fix yourself. You ARE capable of regulating your emotions. You CAN do this. 

So I understand the feelings, but people in our position have feelings that OFTEN lie to us. Don’t be deceived. Pick up a DBT workbook, go to therapy, exercise, everything you can to make YOU feel better. It’ll be worth it before you start depending on ANYONE. And the best part? You’ll never have to feel dependent on anyone again."
BPD,eyja4n8,t3_cwytkx,1567115121.0,"Dissociative episodes man... 
if you pick up the DBT book by McKay and Wood It’s really helpful in mindfulness practices. Also relaxation practices help me. I can now recognize when I need a minute or if I need half an hour. Then I’m able to actually cognitively articulate what I need to say. But yeah, I understand your pain."
BPD,exf5q2a,t1_exeq8ib,1566233271.0,"I needed this. I’m going through the exact same situation with my (now ex) boyfriend. I’m so in love with him and he is still trying to sort out his feelings since the breakup. I often end up splitting and crying even though he still says he loves me and does everything to show me he does love me, but he doesn’t feel like he’s in love with me and it’s something I’m coping with. It is hard though. He’s helping me sort through my feelings and BPD in general because he wants to help and i split the most around him, but he’s incredibly patient and helpful. I am debating whether to take a step back myself because it is incredibly painful but he’s also a huge help. 

Idk man I love being his friend but BPD complicated things A LOT"
BPD,ewmilk7,t1_ewjks01,1565552544.0,That’s absolutely the right perspective to have. All you can do is send the one you love off with the love and compassion they deserve. But make sure you give yourself the same amount of love you give them ♥️
BPD,ewjnzhi,t3_c9andn,1565469459.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. Please seek out support and lean on your friends and family. You’re not alone
BPD,ewjhpvl,t3_colizs,1565466827.0,"I’ve just came to this realization myself. My live in boyfriend and the love of my life just decided to take some time apart so that I could really discover who I was (and admittedly, who he is, as trying help me deal  with my recently diagnosed Bipolar disorder and BPD was his entire focus for 6 months was incredibly draining) . He moved out so we could both have the space we need. It’s been almost two months, and after 30 days of no contact initially, I was forced to be my own best friend and really take care of myself like I would a friend who is down and out, and let me tell you, the kindness I have shown myself has helped me physically, emotionally, and spiritually thrive. He and I are in a limbo phase right now where we’re both discovering ourselves separately but still speaking every day, and it’s been nice not to have to depend on him for validation, a punching bag, or to help comfort me after an episode. 

Use your love for him as motivation to be kinder to yourself and to be the best version of you, without any expectation of him staying or going. Regardless of what happens with him, you’re going to have to be with YOU the rest of your life. You deserve to love yourself enough to take care of yourself and be kind to yourself. 

And take your time with it. Don’t get discouraged when you feel like you mess up, it’s just a learning experience so you can do better next time. Seek out a great therapist and really do the work. You’ll be the ideal version of yourself more quickly than you may think ♥️"
