I also just spotted that, yes they are taking precautions, one of them is limiting the number of people in the gym to 10. Seems reasonable. But that means if you get there at the wrong time you could be sitting there for up to an hour (they are telling people to limit training to 60 mins). Yes, that is unlikely but you could just be sat outside waiting for a while and wasting your day. 

Some notes from their email

***-Do not visit the gym if you are feeling unwell or if anyone you are living with is sick or quarantined.***

And yet ignoring the number of cases where people have been asymptomatic
 

***-Maintain 2 metres of distance between yourself and another gym member while you are training.***

This is next to impossible in some parts of the location I am at. If two people are on any two of four pieces of equipment, you are literally trapped in one part of the gym. 
 

***-Thoroughly wipe your equipment before and after each use. Be sure to wash your hands before and after using the gym.***

Half the people there before never wiped down, why would they start now? 

***-You are not required to wear masks or gloves while training, however, if you prefer to do so, you can bring your own. We do have some masks available if you need one.***

Most activity trackers are measuring the motion of your body and combining that with your height, your weight, your gender, and your age. Sometimes they might have asked you some lifestyle questions during setup and that data can be thrown into the mix.

“Even the cheapest trackers have all of the most important features.”

SuggestMeAPodcast,fp6twrg,t3_gbgiwx,1588358521.0,"You may be better adding in some specific interests you have, but here are a few from me. Mostly comedy / audio drama, and then one family friendly crime one. 

[Wooden Overcoats](https://www.woodenovercoats.com/episodes/) - Rudyard Funn and his equally miserable sister Antigone run their family’s failing funeral parlour, where they get the body in the coffin in the ground on time. But one day they find everyone enjoying themselves at the funerals of a new competitor – the impossibly perfect Eric Chapman! With their dogsbody Georgie, and a mouse called Madeleine, the Funns are taking drastic steps to stay in business…

 [Victoricity](http://www.victoriocity.com/) A detective comedy drama || Even Greater London, 1887. In this vast metropolis, Inspector Archibald Fleet and journalist Clara Entwhistle investigate a murder, only to find themselves at the centre of a conspiracy of impossible proportions.

[Deadly Manners](http://deadlymanners.libsyn.com/website) is a 10 episode, dark comedy murder-mystery series set in the winter of 1954. It follows the events during the night of the affluent Billings family annual dinner party with their distinguished, eccentric guests. However, all is not fun and games as shortly after the party starts, a snowstorm begins to rage outside, trapping all the partygoers inside their host’s mansion. When a murderer starts killing off those in attendance, the guests must figure out who is responsible, or at least how to stay alive.

[Criminal](http://thisiscriminal.com/) (the host has a voice you could listen to reading a phone book it is so nice) is a podcast about crime. Not so much the ""if it bleeds, it leads,"" kind of crime. Something a little more complex. Stories of people who've done wrong, been wronged, and/or gotten caught somewhere in the middle. We are a proud member of Radiotopia, from PRX, a curated network of extraordinary, story-driven shows."
audiodrama,fp688lc,t3_gbi65e,1588347844.0,"Do you have an RSS feed for this? 
I tried converting (via getrssfeed.com) so I can add it to Pocketcasts and it can't find it. 

Thanks"
podcasts,fp67szs,t1_fp65lv9,1588347625.0,"I have about 100 subscribed podcasts (and that is after trimming down and removing some I just never really got into). Some are there just to listen to and try when I get the chance but I would say around half are regular listens. 

Using pocketcasts as my example (as that is my go to app) 

I have 4 daily news casts. These get auto downloaded and queued up for me overnight so they are ready to go (used to be for my drive to work) first thing in the morning. 

I then have others that I listen to without fail that maybe come out weekly / monthly etc. Again, some of these I will auto download and queue, others I will just download and the app notifies me that they are there. This can either be an actual alarm type notification in the top bar, or just by displaying a number on the cast icon. 

With favorites, if I find something in a cast I am listening too and want to easily find it later, I can ""star"" that episode  while listening and go back to it later. This is particularly useful when I am listening in the car and don't have a pen & paper handy. 

Just a couple of things that make (for now) a dedicated app far nicer to use than Spotify.

Each to their own, and I can see why some people would be happy with Spotify, but I just feel it could be so much better as an all round app."
podcasts,fp64xn5,t1_fp64239,1588346146.0,"Copying from another comment I made about Spotify as a podcast app. 
""So I just went into Spotify and (I am happy to be corrected here) I can't see the following functionality that I have with Pocketcasts

1) Auto download of new episodes

2) Auto queue of episodes (or even how to queue at all)

3) Favorite episodes (so I can easily find them later)

4) Additional features that I like from my existing App - Trim silence, Filters, Auto skip (start at a certain time in a podcast)

The one thing I can now see, that I don't remember being there is playback speed, but weirdly I don't like the choices, it's not granular enough (for me). My personal preference is 1.4x and Spotify goes from 1.2 > 1.5. (No idea why I stick at 1.4)

Like I said, I'm happy to be corrected on any of the above, especially as I pay for Spotify (I have a lifetime license for Pocketcasts so it really makes no difference on that side)
""

So unless any of that has changed, it's still not a good podcast app. Stupid really as if they put some time / money / development into it, it really could be a fantastic all in one app and they could probably dominate the market."

podcasts,fp4wl1a,t3_gbb8df,1588309299.0,"Pretty much every app does this by sort feature as has been mentioned. Spotify, whilst being a great music app, is one of, if not the worst podcast app. It's so bad in my opinion that I have not listened too some podcasts if they are exclusive on Spotify. 

Personally I use pocketcasts, but have also used podcast addict, overcast, castbox and Google podcasts. All of which are better for podcast listening."

I was halfway through before I realized I'd not taken in anything they had been saying, so I started again. 

I think maybe having the sound ""in"" my ear from an earphone rather than around me with a speaker (although driving in the car seems to be ok) just works for me better for some reason. 

It could just be that, that is what I am used to, as usually I do a lot of my listening in the office with one earbud in."

Thanks"
podcasts,fovl9zc,t1_foveggy,1588103233.0,"Thanks for taking the time to reply again (not sure why you got downvoted by someone for doing so!) 

So I think there is quite possibly a space for this, but you may or may not be aware, you're not the first to do this (not to discourage you, just saying). 

There is at least one other site, that is a bit like the IMDB of podcasts which is doing much of what you have here. I'm wondering how you plan to make money from this, or do you just see it as a labour of love? 

I think you are right, in that the discovery tabs, are very much run by the hosts or the app developer and that can limit what a user is exposed to, and that can be a bad thing. 

Suggestion so far (which of course is more work though) is to have the link the podcast that is being viewed on the page? I can't see a link for any of the ones I took a quick look at."
