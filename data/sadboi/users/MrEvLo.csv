rpdrtearanny,fqsaqnv,t1_fqrx3z8,1589602417.0,"Lol it’s funny that y’all like this after seeing it on like 5 times in white  or creams(shangela on her second season, and cracker come to mind immediately). It’s fine, but it’s also not anything i’d want to see especially since i’ve actually enjoyed a lot of her runways. Technical toot, but for me it’s weak."
rpdrtearanny,fqsae1d,t1_fqrx5dr,1589602174.0,"I wish it was more styled, like i wish it was a one armed jumpsuit. or like the other arm was sheer material, and the other sleeve/shoulder was slightly bigger, and maybe if she had a blue afro for proportions. and round shapes, I really like how weird this is and it’s fun for me to try and reverse engineer how she came up with this, Soft toot.

Oh and y’all correct the shoes are ugly, wish the front had like basic shoe covers and we called it a day, such an easy fix."
rpdrtearanny,fqsa7aa,t1_fqrx4dd,1589602047.0,"I liked it up until she said that it was warhol inspired, cause there are so many other art references that are more accurate for pop of color and dots (yayoi kusama bitch) but i thought she looked fine. so mean it’s really a fashion high for her very low fashion curve through the middle of the season. Toot."
rpdrtearanny,fqs98xp,t1_fqrx4sj,1589601403.0,"This was top toot for me. I know the sub hates her, but the hair is styled, the silhouette is different, the reference is non movie specific, and it’s fashion and gorgeous like at this point just say you don’t like her and own the bias if this was Manila you’d be eating her pussy up."
rpdrtearanny,fqs8zld,t1_fqrx5x9,1589601229.0,"Toot but also it’s the same caliber as the rest of her runways, if you showed me her runways in a lineup and asked me to pick out the finale i don’t know that i’d be able to identify this one as the finale."

It’s a nitpick, but also that’s what her wardrobe has brought.

I think we could all agree she was going to be the next going home regardless of what she put on that stage earrings or otherwise, but i thought her performance was entertaining she had solid vocals, and her dress wasn’t spectacular but i thought the whole package was safe worthy when looking at Heidi and Jackie, and some of those truly piss poor runways (i’ve been a big apologist for widows runways two weeks in a row, but i really can’t co-sign this one).

Gigi’s performance was stellar and athletic but also it’s not bringing anything new to the table that the judges weren’t aware of , they literally haven’t met Jan before this challenge get in so surprised they didn’t give her the win AKA i’m so surprised that Production is continuing to be this heavy handed.  From this side of the looking glass it’s really is annoying to see them shoe horn the tropes/archetypes back into the show (engenue, upstart, weirdo, pageant queen, etc), and really just trickle it down to a rigged election.

rpdrtearanny,fmdkfn6,t1_fmdci89,1585970120.0,I hate that shoe. I think the garment itself is nice it just needs some better elements.
