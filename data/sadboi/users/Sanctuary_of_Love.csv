Reddit has been an education. Even though I eat unbelievable trash, I have an obsession with the notion of ""clean, safe"" food as well. My shopping cart looks like Jekyll and Hyde are out running errands together. I wish I could banish the notion of good and bad from my mind, and just eat when hungry. Period. 

It sounds like restriction backfires for you. If you had a serious processed food addiction, then maybe cutting out certain foods would be helpful (probably what I have to do, ultimately). But it doesn't sound like you are addicted to junk, so I hope you can find help with easing up on the restrictions that are driving your binges. Lots of love to you."

BingeEatingDisorder,fkic2ee,t1_fkhdx5j,1584216484.0,"I'm happy to hear things are going well for you. That's super exciting!

You're right--it's hard to accept the weight gain that can come with intuitive eating and legalizing (and subsequently overeating) all the problem foods. Part of what has freaked me out is the fact that I'm prediabetic, and anytime I try to legalize all sweets I binge so severely, and for so long, I am afraid I am going to push my body to the breaking point. So after awhile I go back to thinking abstinence is the only answer for me. Wash, rinse, repeat. I hate it. 

So, I bought two more boxes of oatmeal cream pies after the binge that prompted me to post. They aren't calling to me, but I'm now eating a different kind of snack cake plus chocolate candy. So that's how it typically goes for me. The target just keeps shifting. Maybe I could eat my way through it all, until none of it is very special...theoretically. I just fear the consequences. Do you know of any resources where legalization/intuitive eating advice is given for people with prediabetes or other conditions where it might be dangerous to eat cookie dough for every meal like Geneen Roth famously did when she was overcoming restriction?"
EatingDisorders,fkiayhr,t3_fifqok,1584215745.0,"Totally understand your feelings and I've felt torn too. I did go on one shopping trip to get stuff like dried beans and some canned goods, but I don't have a ton at home. Honestly, I trust that the bottomless profit motive of major stores (Walmart!!) will ensure they will find a way to sell us food no matter what happens. I don't care if it's curbside pickup or delivery by workers wearing biohazard suits--everyone has to eat and they want our money. 

My real challenge is to stop eating junk so my immune system can be firing on all cylinders. I have an autoimmune disease and I feel like I catch everything that goes around during regular cold/flu season. My one advantage is that I'm an extreme introvert and totally fine with staying home and seeing no one indefinitely."

This is where I've landed with my various insecurities: if I can't do it for me, I do it for others LIKE me. We have to put ourselves out there and normalize whatever attributes we have, because they exist in other people too. There are kids out there that are going to grow up and have a small head, or a weird ass, or scars, or offset eyes, or whatever it is we wish we could hide. They need to see people older than themselves living life with no apologies. 

If we gotta fake it til we make it, so be it. If we gotta do it for a hypothetical kid somewhere out there, so be it.

I don't have the answer for myself today, but I have decided to buy two more boxes of oatmeal cream pies when I go to the store later in the hopes they just sit there and don't take on the glow of forbidden fruit again. Because I just ate a whole box and have two more boxes--how special could they be?  Let's see how this goes."
BingeEatingDisorder,fkb1wjt,t1_fk9vky5,1584024431.0,"I really appreciate your perspective. I've become confused over the years about whether this is true for me, though. I know restriction drives many people's binges. I've tried to legalize and normalize all food so many times in the past...I own all the books, from Geneen Roth, to the intuitive eating literature, to Josie Spinardi...I'm really familiar with that philosophy and how well it works for some. But lately I'm wondering about the difference between binge eating disorder and processed food addiction. I've been diagnosed with BED and always saw myself that way, but now I'm wondering if I ALSO have processed food addiction (a concept not everyone takes seriously), or perhaps ONLY have a processed food addiction. I never binge on regular wholesome food. I think a ""true"" binge eater could and would binge on anything. If a person only loses control with a specific subset of foods, for decade after decade, doesn't that sound more like addiction to that specific class of foods?

If I have binge eating disorder, I probably have to stop restricting. If I have a processed food addiction, I need to be abstinent from my trigger foods the same way any other addict is abstinent from their drug of choice. And if I have both--which I probably do--I have no clue how to reconcile these two different treatment approaches. 

Anyone that has insight into this, I really welcome your comments. Florisda999, thanks for getting the wheels turning. I've never really spelled this out before but it's the crux of my problem."

BodyAcceptance,fkb0jky,t1_fk9iz3p,1584023607.0,"I hear you. A skilled therapist would not just try to compliment you or get you to repeat affirmations, though. I hope that wasn't your experience! They should be helping you see through the lies you tell yourself, primarily. And maybe you'd benefit from unhooking from thought altogether, for part of each day. Mindfulness can give you a reprieve and let you see your thoughts AS thoughts, instead of as irrefutable gospel truth. It's just the stuff your mind cranks out. Some of it is true and some of it is garbage. 

Some folks benefit from lovingkindness meditation before getting into mindfulness. If a person is carrying lots of self-loathing, they may need metta (lovingkindness) first in order to be able to sit and feel what they are feeling in the moment. 

I'm a meditation instructor and a counselor-in-training, so of course I hype my own methods. I wish you well."

Fleurlala's wonderful answer makes me think I need to get a grip on the binge eating and forget about weight loss, but the two are so entangled in my mind. I want to stop binging BECAUSE of my weight. If I'm being really honest, I don't want to stop for any other reason."

BingeEatingDisorder,fjxqeeh,t3_fe3l9u,1583680854.0,"Hi there, I created an account just to answer your question! There is a brilliant woman named Kelly Coffey that has a program called the Pleasure Principles, and it's all about teaching women how to overcome--her exact words--""shame-based self-sabotage."" The vast majority are self-sabotaging through food and binge eating, though other addictions can be addressed through the program. It's an online course and a Facebook community, but the FB portion is only open to women for various reasons. 

I don't get anything for recommending Kelly, like a kickback or anything. And in full disclosure, I recently decided to end my monthly membership which gives me access to resources beyond the course. The reason why? Just as you feel self-sabotage is the main thing driving your episodes, and need something that will target EXACTLY that, I don't feel the course targets EXACTLY what I'm needing. (And how could a course, no matter how genius, be the perfect fit for everyone? Impossible.) I have learned tons from the Pleasure Principles. In my case, I need to be really careful with how I personify my cravings or the Craving Voice inside me. It has taken me forever to figure this out. The way Kelly personifies those cravings/that self-sabotage works for tons of people, but it trips me up on a very subtle level.

I wish you the greatest success!"
