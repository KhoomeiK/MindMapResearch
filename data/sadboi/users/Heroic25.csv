AskReddit,fa93ozv,t1_fa849in,1575861611.0,"That’s why it’s a bad example. Because it’s got so many people with such a low income for minimum wage and to high of a living cost.  I get people get stuck in an endless cycle. But it is not the norm. Most people choose to stay at their job or city because they either like their job or stay in the city because they Ike the city or they have family. 

All I’m saying regardless of the job is if you’re not making enough with your current career path either find another one and stay in your city, or stay with your career and move to another city. I get that it’s not the only options people as well. You can fight for a higher minimum wage, or ask your boss for a raise. 

The whole point of my original comment was that servers shouldn’t complain about not making the federal minimum wage with tips because they LEGALLY have to get paid the minimum federal wage."
AskReddit,fa7pn5c,t1_fa6ufky,1575836974.0,"I get you point but LA is a bad example as prices for things there are WAAAAY over inflated. The minimum wage their doesn’t cater to the cost of living.

AskReddit,fa7n7hh,t1_fa6s3d6,1575836288.0,I mean I used to serve so I understand how it works. But it’s illegal to not be given the federal minimum wage if you claim you did not make that.

AskReddit,fa6plnx,t1_fa6ohdx,1575827280.0,"Exactly people get mad when I say that servers don’t actually make 3.25 an hour. Because they get tips they can make them get well over 12-15$ an hour. Plus if they don’t meet the federal minimum wage with tips the company has to provide them the extra.

Yes I know some companies make you claim that you got minimum wage regardless of if you made that or not. But that’s illegal and when I bring that up people say “well I don’t want to be fired” like dude if their being illegal with their financial policies then leave that company there’s other places."
