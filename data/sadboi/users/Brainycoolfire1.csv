porterrobinson,fk7utsj,t3_fgt7ee,1583944040.0,"Very similar stories, you and I. Worlds helped me escape in high school when I needed too, but it also helped me see the beauty in the world, at a time when I hated myself and the world so much and wanted nothing but to die. It gave me hope when I had none. It helped me find myself and carve my way out of depression and suicidal ideations, something I still struggle with to this day. 

Then I was happy with a girl. I thought I knew what I wanted when I proposed to her and when the feelings shortly thereafter, began to fade and I realized that it wasn't what I wanted, I went into a deep, dark place and clung to Worlds for comfort again. Then, months after my realization of what I must do, Porter releases Get Your Wish, and the lyrics fucking hurt, ""Did you get your wish?"" I did, but it wasn't what I truly wanted. I broke it off with my fianc√©e a few weeks later. And it was the absolute hardest thing I've ever had to do. I know it was the right thing to do but it still hurts so monumentally much because I still love her but she's just not the one I want to spend my life with. And I hate that I had to come to that conclusion. Something Comforting showed me for the first time since I did it, that there's still hope, that this is not the end. ""Hoping made you hurt more"", was me hoping that I still loved her enough to marry her but being in full blown denial for months. The song hurts so bad but also gives me so much hope for the future. Porter always releases music when I need it most."
