Let me tell you this: I'm blaming myself so much for hurting myself because of the words of someone, I deserve this punishment for taking my frustration on my hand, I will make sure no one will get so much control over me with mere words next time, I will drop toxic people out of my mind, I'm sorry for myself and in return I will make sure my hand heals properly and will take the prescribed meds.

Right now drop what ever bad thought in your mind, focus on the task at hand, apologize to  yourself and accept it, make a promise you will never hurt yourself again, wait for your leg to heal, take care of the injury, recovery is top priority, let that be your apology to yourself and very soon the feeling of guilt will fade and you will have more strength and control over your reactions.

Wish speedy recovery for both of us."

My experience, I was called having *""mommy's issues*"" and when I said I was sexually harassed by women before I was told to *""get my frustration on the men who harassed me"",* wow those were some kind of funny jokes tbh, the ones that push a man to suicidal thoughts.

I lived my life thinking about every cruel thing that I got told my mother, father, siblings, uncles and aunts, but then I found the truth, so instead of fighting, I just learned to let it go, I know for sure I can respond, I have the right and power, I have everything I need, but I won't let that out on my family, even though they are to blame.

Just let their words pass, with time they will do better, you were born as their child, you sadly can't change that, so we try to adapt, it's the hardest, but it's possible and the benefits are very good, don't take anything personal, as soon as their stress pass they will be less harsh, I hope so.

and the 2nd point is actually the root of my way thinking, you feel there is a problem when machine doesn't function as intended, that's (my pov again) how humanity defined what's a problem and what's not, so a human functions, a human is OK, otherwise let's research the root of their problem, and humanity actually creates a whole science/research field called psychology, cause in the end, if you have to solve a problem, you have to acknowledge it's existence, find the source, create solutions.

as for your third paragraph, honestly I didn't think about it that you before, if I understood you, you meant that mental disorders are a way of mutation humanity is trying to make so it can break the cycle of the social machine, if you mean so, then sadly I can't answer cause I really don't know,

But I can still tell you how it affects my mental stability, when I found the truth (being just a cog in a bigger machine only burning gas for the elite without any actual purpose in life), this truth amplified my depression, and then came some thoughts of the ""anti-work"" movement and also ""anti-natalism"", but we all know that this rebellious thinking will only costs our lives instead of saving them, the opposite of survival, but then again, if you succeeded in proving your individual pov to a whole society then you have just created a brand new type of survival, so I'm still 50-50 regarding the mutation theory.

theCalaisPlan,fp68ts6,t3_gbga5p,1588348146.0,"Sorry for the long comment, you can read the last paragraph for a smaller version.

&#x200B;

I remember indulging into too much daydreaming which consumed my off-work days, so I originally started to research the difference between schizophrenia and daydreaming, then I found something very interesting, the difference between normal daydreaming and **maladaptive** daydreaming, essentially, when daydreaming affects your quality of life to the worse and harms your social skills / work / anything in your life it becomes maladaptive,

I can use that same criteria regarding any disorder there is, actually what makes a disorder called as such?, form a social pov it's when a something starts to lessen your functionality in society, so it's all about functioning and having good interactions with humans, even if one's behaviour is odd than average.

Another point, why should I love or hate or be neutral towards some something?, it depends on how this thing affects me, if it benefits me then I love it and you know the rest, so for example we are now talking about NPD, should I love someone with NPD or hate them?, depends on how they interact with me. so it's totally subjective.

&#x200B;

[Narcissistic personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder)

NPD has many characteristics, it has defenses and offenses, I for one have some of them in me (not by external diagnosis), which are for example believing in myself so much and that my sense of rightness isn't to be judged, ""I will treat you perfectly, you have to do the same, or else you're a traitor and I can never forgive that"", but then I got to tell you that I had multiple NPD's in my life and I could never imagine being like them, actually I get instantly triggered when I feel the presence of NPD techniques in a conversation, so after that comes the war of ""I hate NPD so much, I cannot be accused with such a disorder!, but then I know I have some of their qualities/defenses"".

Being arrogant, or egoistic, loving attention and leadership, trusting oneself to the very extreme, isn't something essentially bad if and only if not used against someone to hurt them,

But let's talk about some other defenses/attacks, manipulation, blame-shifting, projection, gaslighting, those can harm someone to extents some of us don't know about, NPD's are never wrong, they never payback for what they did, nor take responsibility, they see people as a chess game, if one soldier got out of their circle, they push every other **piece** against that soldier, criticism is a trigger, unconditional love is a right, and they will test it from time to time by stressing their loved ones and anticipating their reactions, the point is when they become angry they destroy everyone who took part of it.

Edit: forgot to mention the most important part, they don't have to have all these characteristics at the same time, and surely not all of them have the destructive techniques I mentioned above, it all depends on which part/s of NPD one chose to be their defense.

&#x200B;

Is it something to be proud of or not?, depends, can that one function in society?, does it lessen their life quality?, is anyone around them being hurt or annoyed?,

answer to those with yes, no, and no, then you have a narcissistic who can legitimately be proud of themselves, their knowledge/skills and sense of self, (only if they do have the knowledge/skills they claim to have of course), and same goes for anyone with or without NPD."

Having my heart rate above resting rates all the time I'm having an anxiety episode is like doing a cardio workout without even moving at all, I made this theory at when I started my first job, felt like anxiety makes me endure far less hours of work than usual."

* Specify one anime, watch it normally.

* Start with what you have, keep adding scenes using your memory and binge watching the show multiple times

If you never video edited before I suggest you first learn how to trim and cut video clips in your timeline and get very used to it, then start your AMV, no fancy effects or transitions needed, just make sure you know how to fade to black/white.

SuicideWatch,foc6zo1,t3_g66pxu,1587667841.0,"2018, I remember all of this, it was a very bad time for me, especially my finals month and it was my graduation year, also the graduation project after the finals gave me some anxiety, back then I had no one to support me, me and my family had our disagreements so we were totally disconnected, I was 100% alone (unless only if one of my friends needed help with studying).

For now, what you can do is to blind yourself, from any anxiety, stress, bad intrusive thoughts, imagination,

put a certain goal in front of you, this goal is called succeeding with the highest grades possible, even make a **mantra** for it, **""I'm gonna succeed no matter what it takes""**, whenever you doubt anything, just say the mantra, and don't think twice, just look at the paper in front of you, with a low volume concentration music, focus only on the task at hand.

Most importantly, don't forget treating yourself too, take breaks, do 10 mins yoga, play some video games, watch YouTube, listen to music and daydream a bit, make sure your mind is at piece at any given moment, then get back to your current subject.

Summary is, make yourself a daily schedule, decide how much hours of studying, and same for breaks, don't leave a moment of your day empty, fill your mind with many tasks and you won't even have the energy to have bad thoughts or dive deep into them, and at the end of the day you can have a good sleep, knowing that you worked hard today, you done your duties, no guilty feeling, you deserve a good 8 hours of sleep.

3: I'm not 10 I'm 24, listen stop bringing my age into this, you're the most fucking person I shouldn't have opened up to as you said, also what is this part about ""don't abuse girls""?, my questions was can you abuse a girl in her childhood, and then tell her when she is 24 ""you are 24 not 10 so shut the fuck up about you being abused?"", but ofc you dodged the questions, filthy way to manipulate my words and make me accept abuse, you're certainly one of those ""women get abused all the time, so men deserve the fuck they see and they should swallow""

5: I didn't talk about my past, fuck off.

6: watch the video of a man who hit a woman back after she hit him for no reason, read the news about men losing everything cause of women who falsely accused them of violence, a man is smart enough to what?, fuck you, try to fight a whole society when hitting an abusive woman, sorry fuck you again.

7: I'm not playing the victim, go tell that to a woman and she tells you ""ya blame the victim"", fuck your hypocrisy

You are telling me to just ignore 90%+ of society and think as I wish, well if it was like that I wouldn't have posted here, if I could ever defend myself in front of woman like I do in front of man I would have taken your philosophy into account, honey if it's a man I swear I have no problem fucking him up, but a girl can fuck me up and I can't ever touch her, it's not about how one's think or a mental fucking block, it's how Earth works at the end, you will adhere to others norms no matter how your mentality is.

&#x200B;

>And stop telling others about your past. You're opening yourself up for  abuse! They learn that you got abused therefore you're WEAK and after  they hear about that they start to PROFIT.

Oh I wish you can fucking say that to a girl who got harassed in her childhood or whenever, who give a shit? LOL, you give a shit, every woman gives a shit, lawsuits made after tens of years, don't tell me who gives a shit.

and also I should stop telling other about my past?, woah, that sentence alone is enough to fuck a man's life up should he say it to a harassed woman, where did you think the whole fucking move of metoo started from ha?!, there were all following this fucking mentality of shutting the fuck up until one woman stood for herself, you're essentially creating a good path for harassing woman to continue what they do, making it easy to get away with it, **are you in you fucking senses???!!!**

&#x200B;

>Not at 24 you should stop asking for sympathy also. Yes is fucking  unfair that girls and women get a ton of sympathy, but what do we say to  that? We say ""adapt, survive, prosper"" and that is what we do! We ADAPT  to live without their fake sympathy and despite their lack of support  we will survive and even prosper!

So you only asked my age for that ha?, to even gaslight me more, so I will now go sexually abuse an underage girl and after 10 years I could just tell her ""oh forget about it, haha, wasn't a big deal"", I remember this mentality of yours, but the other toxic feminist called me a crybaby haha, you should tell that to all the metoo movement if you fucking think so, and no, I won't survive, I didn't fucking survive before, I'm not surviving at fucking 24, so don't even think about telling me to not give a fuck about being fucking touched and harassed everyday, my childhood events made me the fuck I'm at 24, this fuck that you hate so much, that is hypersensitive around girls, the girls who get the sympathy you mentioned if they are hypersensitive themselves, those are the same girls that call me an incel and misogynist, same as you telling me the same shit.

&#x200B;

>Also, remember this. At 24 someone  must tell you directly, everyone around is FAKING IT! So, you, trying to  be honest, you're gonna get ripped apart by an entire society of FAKERS  and HYPOCRITES!

>weakness around assholes they will ABUSE the living shit out of you! So stop showing weakness!

I'm sorry I ever showed weakness honey like the bitch I'm, I will just destroy any woman who gets near, and I will continue to tell about my past that you try to manipulate me into not telling it, I will take both, I will ensure a new movement a new era where all the man tell the tale, against any woman who tries to manipulate them into accepting and faking it, you seem to be psychologically aware, the technique that is called fake it until you make it, I will start acting that I'm okay, I will really okay after words, hell come rape now I beg your toes.

&#x200B;

>One day the abuser will fuck with the wrong people and you will gonna find him in a ditch. Or get caught and sent to jail. But until then, YOU must be safe! don't become a victim just because ""I  feel that the society should not blame victims"". Fuck that!

Fuck that?, fuck you, men are always accused of blaming the victim, once I'm the victim I should stop being the victim LOL, Pathetic, like I've chosen to be harassed, I swear you're doing that on purpose.

&#x200B;

>You're a victim because you allow others to take advantage of you! You  open up too much, you trust too much, you want support, sympathy and  affection from the wrong kind of people!

Shut up, just shut the fuck up, if you're daughter was fucking raped you gonna tell her you were the victim because she fucking allowed other to take adv of her, JUST SHUT THIS GODDMAN BULLSHIT UP CAUSE IT'S GETTING FUCKING FILTHY.

>Usually women don't act this way

Now this part is where you lost me honestly, btw what's your gender? ofc if I may ask, it's not about where I live or how to avoid them, or how to find an excuse for all what I seen so I can move on with my life, it's about once I find a new job, I will take public transport again, I will be oppressed again, I will have to deal with random heaps of them everyday again, I will meet them at work, everyday, I will avoid them, I will be bullied, by them and their ass-kissers, once I show my avoidance I will be your typical misogynist.

The whole point is, when a girl vents about how she was sexually abused when she was younger, she gets a pass for her misandry, and I agree with that actually, but women shouldn't just tell me to go fuck myself and lock myself in my room for having the same POV, why if I shouldn't stare she can stare?, why if should be very freaking careful while crossing a woman in a public transport, or sitting beside one, but she can do the hell she wants, why am I always to be blamed?, why when I call for same rights, most women attack me with all the forbidden weapons they have on me, like my mental unsuitability and heap of disorders and body-shaming and what's not, why is it a crime called cyber-bullying when used against a woman, but openly used against me the fucking born with dick creature?!

Edit 2: I once said something like ""Usually men don't act this way"" and instantly I was called an incel and gaslighter and sexual harassment justifier against women.

Edit 3: You really got me more angry right now with such a statement, I explicitly stated that most of them does, and you just try to say that It's something wrong with my POV or luck, no not at all, most of them, if not all of them, do the whatever the hell they do, I know the exact difference between a bad woman and a whole abusing gender, if you can't stand in my shoes then don't say something like that."

Calling someone names based on their view is wrong, you may call it toxic and I will agree with you, but it's not about that, you can see many civilized comments there as well, also based on your criteria any subreddit on this platform with a certain view will be called brainwashing, if brainwashing is holding to their perspective.
