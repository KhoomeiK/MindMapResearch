Kudos to you for doing that for someone."

bipolar,f7iwu7o,t3_dwc2mu,1573766849.0,"I would personally. Everyone reacts differently to different meds and it's a lot of trial and error finding the right meds, sometimes it's a ""cocktail"" of multiple medications that are required. I take the lamictal but I also take clonazepam for the anxiety. And it took 6 different meds to get me here."
bipolar,f7i5npv,t3_dwc2mu,1573753305.0,"I'm on it as well and while I am still forgetful from time to time, I haven't experienced what you have. I'm sorry I can't relate but this is my third medications and at 100mg, I feel that it helps me. Are there other meds you take that could be causing these issues as well?"

They say time heels all wounds and hopefully you and your significant other can come to terms with it and move on to absolute happiness."
NoStupidQuestions,f7fxmub,t3_dukoym,1573689245.0,"The Oxford dictionary defines a Veteran as ""a person who has served in the military""

So yes by all accounts he is a veteran. I have been in for 9 years and I'm considered a veteran. I consider anyone who has sworn the oath into the armed forces and has served honorably, a veteran, whether currently serving or not.

It's okay to be proud, but never too proud. Service before self."

You seem to crave the satisfaction of pleasing someone. Could that be become something is missing from you? Just something to think about. I wish you the best.
