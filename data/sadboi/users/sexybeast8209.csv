depression,fopz0t8,t3_g8eq07,1587976999.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you hun. I wish there was a way to make you feel better but I know there really isn't anything anyone can do or say to take this pain away; losing someone you truly love is a greater pain than anything in life. I'm sure if I ever were to lose my husband I'd be devastated as well to the point of severe depression. We've been together for over two years and, even though we get into some pretty heated arguments (what couple doesn't) i feel he is the one I've been waiting for for so long. We are compatible; we understand each other, etc. To me, he's perfect; he may not be in other people's minds but their opinion doesn't matter. Its my opinion that matters. And I love him dearly. This is the first time in my life that I've ever truly been in love. And I know he loves me just the same. 

I feel so bad that your beautiful mate was murdered. My whole life (well, ever since I was 21) I've wanted to be a cop/detective. No one deserves to be murdered! But those who do murder deserve to be found, tried, and punished for their crimes. Thats why I want to be a cop really bad but I need to overcome some obstacles first

I know its hard but don't give up on love, life, schooling, etc. You,  just like her, are a beautiful asset that the world needs; YOU matter; YOU have a purpose, a destiny. Take care and always know that there are other people like me who are here for you that are rooting you on ‚ù§"

Beauty is only skin deep; hot girls can keep making fun of me because, even though I don't have a sexy body or beautiful face, I know that I got something they don't have-a pure, innocent, beautiful heart. Once you realize that you have that same sweet, pure, innocent beauty inside you'll feel a lot better. Hope you find it my friend :)"

 Though I never intend to do so I am physically abusive. But incidents that happen to my partner are those that were done on accident which shouldn't be done at all I know. I go to therapy and I always talk to my therapist about these things and admit to him I'm in the wrong. When I get very angry my only  way of releasing that frustration thats boiling up inside me is by throwing things. Unfortunately this is how I hurt my partner because he seems to always be in the line of whatever I throw. It's not what I intend to do it just happens that way. I am currently working on myself but then again I also know that it's not all just me. I may be physical but he puts me through a lot of emotional abuse as well. Being in foster care and growing up with an abusive mother I wasn't allowed to take those emotions out in any way otherwise I'd probably would've had the crap beaten out of me."
