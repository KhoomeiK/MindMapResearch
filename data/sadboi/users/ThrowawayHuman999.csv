Browsing through this subreddit, it's easy to see countless examples of people being labelled idiots, or worse, for the act or choosing to have children. It's littered with people who actively consider themselves ""anti-natalists"". I don't personally care whether people choose to have kids or not, but the sentiment of many others here is quite different.

>My point being your making a vast generalization about one country of the world that you probably have never been to and don’t know anything about.

I know more than enough about it. And no, I haven't been there, and I don't plan to ever set foot there. 

>I’m guessing you don’t like south asians or Muslims and are single out Pakistan as “bad” instead of many other countries that are also problematic.

I don't like islam one bit. I don't like christianity either. Both religions are vile, outdated fairytales, but only one is going to cut my head off or send me death threats for defacing its holy text.

I was simply using Pakistan as an example. Muslim countries in general rank very lowly when it comes to opportunities for women."

I believe the prevailing consensus (among neuroscientists, for example) is that consciousness *is* an emergent product of the brain. I suspect that most serious philosophical discussions pertaining to the idea of consciousness are more about its nature, or how to define it, rather than whether or not it exists independently of the brain or perhaps some sort of machine. The concept of ""self"" can be a tricky thing to define, as it changes over time, but whatever happens to us over time is ultimately a product of chemicals and electrical charges in the brain.

You can define ""you"" however you'd like, but you're still just a brain."
