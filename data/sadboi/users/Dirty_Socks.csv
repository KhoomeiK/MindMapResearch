DeepIntoYouTube,fr0l4mh,t1_fqyaz0t,1589799464.0,"So the guy left some irate and vaguely threatening voicemails on the phone of one of the police officers. She reported them to the police department. The police decided to prosecute, which lead to him having a restraining order and his guns taken away. 

He filed a counter suit, alleging that it was 1) malicious prosecution, AKA that a government official was abusing their power to use the legal system against him, and 2) that it was a violation of his rights to free speech for him to be prosecuted for that. 

The officer then filed a motion asking the judge to dismiss this suit because it, to put it bluntly, was more inane bullshit. 

The judge found that 1) it wasn't malicious prosecution because the officer who he threatened didn't take part in the case at all other than reporting the voicemails to the department. AKA: all further actions were taken by people not directly involved, so she was not abusing her power against him. 

2) it wasn't a violation of his protected speech because - A) it wasn't public speech or directed at the police in general, but rather was threatening her specifically on a private line, and B) the words may be protected but a harassing demeanor is not. 

With that in mind, the case was dismissed without need for a hearing, because both parties agreed on the facts and the judge finds that the facts show no grounds for prosecution."
electricians,fqv27g6,t1_fquvmck,1589668398.0,"The only difference between rust and fire is speed. They're both the process of oxygen eating away at a material. When a metal gets hot (welding temperature), rusting happens basically instantaneously. So we use shielding gas (such as the noble gas Argon) to blow away the oxygen and replace it with something that doesn't react with metal to oxidize it. 

With TIG and MIG welding, these come from a tank and are blown in while the electrical arc is created. With stick welding, the center of the stick is made of something called flux, which will evaporate with the heat and push the oxygen away (as well as chemically de-rusting some of the metal)."
explainlikeimfive,fquu0d6,t1_fquo39b,1589664555.0,"A CPU does one operation on one piece of data at a time. You have a number, say 3, and you want to add 5 to it, so you get 8. 

A GPU does one operation on several pieces of data at a time. You have some numbers [1,8,6,2] and you want to add 5 to them, so you get [6,13,11,7]. This happens at basically the same speed as the CPU, without taking 4x the silicon to do it. 

The caveat is that usually you care more about being flexible and doing lots of different stuff, rather than doing one thing a lot. But there are a lot of pixels on your screen and the math to fill them up is basically the same. So GPUs will have hundreds of cores, but they're restricted in what they can do, and they work in parallel. 

So to answer your question, a many-core CPU will never actually be a GPU, because it can always be doing different things with all its cores. And what's ridiculous is that we've gotten so good at making chips that we can use a CPU as a GPU for old games."

Because of how family units work, and because people won't start a family if they're living with their parents, you have to build new houses to even out a population spread. And if you don't build new houses basically all the time, you can get into the pattern where there are no places for families to bear children, because all the houses are taken up by old families, which means that leaving the town unattended can basically doom it.

Also, just for terminology's sake: the extruder is the bit with the motor and the gear that pushes the filament. The hotend is the part with the nozzle that melts the filament and squeezes it out.

nOfAileDPriNtS,fqcj35q,t3_ghtd15,1589259528.0,"That looks like hellish amounts of underextrusion, plus possibly (?) a high temperature leading to sagging. 

Make sure the filament is feeding smoothly into the extruder while the printer is running. If the extruder starts making clicking sounds while it's trying to print, that means it's failing to feed and is thus underextruding. A low temperature, or the wrong extruder tension (too low or too high) can lead to that. 

Also, could be that the flow rate is just messed up. If you have a different type of extruder compared to what your slicer expects, it could be using the wrong math. During another print, mess with increasing the flow percentage. I'd honestly try big jumps, like 150% or 200%. 

It could also be a clogged nozzle. Doing a cold pull (google it) can help remove any debris from the nozzle, if anything was left there by the factory or by cheap filament."

But there are not new *concepts* that a mod can add. A mod can create different versions of assembling machines but it can't invent a new type of one.

I have taken the liberty of opening up some files from the Industrial Revolution mod.

    -- assembler 2
    
    speed = 1
    energy = get_scaled_energy_usage(speed, 0.04)
    
    assembler = data.raw[""assembling-machine""][""assembling-machine-2""]
    
    assembler.crafting_speed = speed
    assembler.crafting_categories = {""crafting"",""advanced-crafting"",""crafting-with-fluid""}
    assembler.energy_usage = energy.active
    assembler.energy_source = {
        type = ""electric"",
        usage_priority = ""secondary-input"",
        drain = energy.passive,
        emissions_per_minute = 1.5,
    }

You may notice that it has characteristics such as crafting speed, crafting categories, and energy usage. These categories and concepts cannot be created by a mod, they can only be reused and combined in new ways. In other words, the concept of ""crafting speed"" has to *already exist* before a mod can use it.

There are also other machines that don't look like assemblers but which are still assemblers.

    -- bronze furnace
    
    speed = 1.5
    
    bronze_furnace.type = ""assembling-machine""

Furnaces are also assembling machines, because they take a recipe and items and output them.

factorio,fq4qsur,t1_fq4jewu,1589082009.0,"He's right, though. The game provides a set of base behaviors such as ""this thing consumes an item and creates energy"", or ""this thing creates an item from other items using a predefined recipe"". The game uses these behaviors in its own ""base mod"", for example as an assembly machine. 

The API functions that are exposed are created *after* the parts of the base game. So there is the API concept of an assembly machine, which only exists because the devs needed to create an assembly machine in the base game. 

So the code has the concept of an assembly machine. The base mod uses this to create the ""assembly machine 1"". Another mod could use it to create an ""assembly machine 5"". But the idea of a machine which creates an object using a recipe has to *already exist* in the base game. A mod can't create that behavior, it can only modify it. 

As such all mod objects are modified versions of default game objects. There are a few cases where those game objects are not used in the base mod, but there are zero cases where that *behavior* is not already created by the devs. And these game objects are fairly specific. Things like power poles, vehicles, logistics robots. A mod can create a different power pole, with different range or connections, but it would still just be a power pole. It couldn't create something entirely new, such as a wireless fluid distributor or something. And that's what the previous guy was saying. Every mod has to use ideas, concepts, and behaviors that already exist in the game."

Ghost_in_the_Shell,fpx5ltx,t3_gfq9gk,1588976101.0,"I liked it, I felt it had a good number things that made SAC good. The plot seems interesting but I really wish they had either resolved it or had a longer season, instead of stopping literally in the middle of a rising plot arc. Mainly this bothers me because they're not guaranteed a second season, so if they don't get it, we're just left with zero resolution. 

Plot-wise it seemed good enough. One thing I really appreciated was the stand-alone episode in the middle. Those little diversions were parts of SAC that I liked a lot and I appreciated a callback. 

I'm ambivalent about its stylistic move more towards anime. I'm not talking about the graphics/animation, but about the many parts of general animes that are purposefully overacted/overdone. The trivial violence (getting shot at with no risk) from E1 was like that and left a bad taste in my mouth, but luckily they didn't go too much back to that. The pink haired girl teeters towards that as well, but they improved her a lot by making her competent. 

Overall I did enjoy it, and I hope they'll make more seasons. The sub is going to bitch about it because, like all subs dedicated to a topic, only the most hardcore fans rise to the top, which means most of the sub's discourse is about the first movie, and anything ""lesser"" than that is going to get railed on no matter what.

Most plastics that are created are just thrown away. Even those that make it to a sorting facility may yet be thrown away, if they are contaminated, or if the automated sorting machines can't categorize them (which is the case for huge numbers of things). 

Even when you can recycle plastic, the process downgrades it, which means that there is limited use for it. 

Sound insulation in cars is already made of cloth and carpet scraps. But you don't want to use the carpet scraps from 30 years of dirt and smoke and crumbs, because that contaminates the new product. 

In a controlled incineration facility, you can reduce toxic emissions very far and also generate electricity. Several Scandinavian countries do it. 

The thing is: recycling isn't free. And sometimes the cost required to prep, sort, clean, and reprocess materials (especially mixed materials) outweighs what you can get back from them. 

Glass, for instance, usually *costs* money to recycle. Because it's heavy, it takes a lot of energy (fuel) to move to and from recycling facilities, and that outweighs the cost of just making new glass from sand. 

Similarly, there's a reason the cars are here in the first place: the cost of keeping them running outweighed the benefit of doing so. And any actually valuable parts would usually already be harvested to repair existing cars. But by this point sometimes there's just no demand for random parts off a 30 year old car. So it gets sent to the one place where value can still be regained: the raw metal. 

Make no mistake: it's not great. But it's the end of the line. After a certain point, most things are just no longer useful, and this is the last step of getting what we can back from it."

Bitcoin is like digital gold, and banks existed just fine when gold was a standard."
TrueAskReddit,fpc1up5,t1_fpbvdm4,1588484945.0,"It is considered reasonable that a society will ban things that are bad for its inhabitants. The only question is where you draw the line. 

The easiest one is murder. Murder is illegal because it is bad for people to be dead. 

Then you have areas that are more gray. Gun bans are discussed because guns do in fact make it easier for murder to happen, which means legal guns lead to more successful murder. The question is where the line is drawn between restricting the freedom of gun ownership versus the harm that it does to people in society. 

Driving is another example. We ban certain groups (children, but also drunk people) from driving because a car that's out of control is a danger to others. That is restricting their freedom but it is also keeping other members of society safe. 

These are all in the same category of protecting other people from physical harm. 

Then you get into the category of protecting people from harming *themselves*. There are, ad far as I can see, two main arguments for this. 

The first argument is that, when a person hurts themselves and later requires medical care, it creates a cost for society. This cost can be indirect, in the form of lost productivity, or it can be direct, in paying for medical bills (either through group insurance premiums or through taxes). 

The second argument is that society should protect people from their own bad judgement. Most laws involving minors fall into this, and it's a more shaky category (but not the shakiest). Most laws involving kids fall into this. 

Smoking laws, seatbelt laws, helmet laws. All of those things have higher restrictions for children than they do for adults, because we as a society have agreed that children are not yet in a place to make decisions in their own best interest. *Crucially*, the philosophical justification is that an adult of sound mind, looking back at their own past, would believe that they did not have sound mind when they were younger. In other words, the idea that we voluntarily would restrict our past selves. 

This category is where it's easy to put cigarette laws. Cigarettes are unquestionably addictive, and it's considered better to let someone make that choice when they have the life experience and mental development to do so properly. 

But also we have the harm part of cigarettes. When someone is dying in a hospital due to COPD, that creates a lot of societal costs. Likewise when someone is paralyzed for life because of a motorcycle (or bicycle) head injury while not wearing a helmet. That creates its own societal cost. 

There is a subtle extra part to this category. It is obvious to many why we would restrict the choice of minors: because they don't have all the information and they can't always act in their own best interest. But there is the second question of whether this logic applies to adults too. There are laws where we restrict the freedoms of adults because we believe that an individual person does not always have the ability or desire to act in their own best interest. 

Cigarette taxes, soda taxes. These are ""soft"" laws intended to discourage these activities which people would otherwise happily gorge themselves on. Similarly, anti-trust laws (and anti-lobbying laws), pro-union laws. The moral question is whether a corporation (or just an amoral, charismatic person) is capable of convincing a person to act against their own best interests. In my opinion, it happens all the time. 

Finally we have the last category of laws restricting freedoms (and in my opinion the least justifiable): moralizing. This is where freedoms are restricted simply because the majority (or those in power) find such behaviors, or their perpetrators, to be distasteful. This is the category that weed falls into, originally made illegal in a racially motivated gesture to repress Hispanics (same for heroin and black people, incidentally, though it does cause more harm than the others). Gay sex is here. Alcohol is somewhat here, though it obviously causes some societal harm as well. These are the ones most easily described as ""between consenting adults, and harming no one"". 

However the justifications are similar to the previous category. Proponents would argue that people are harming themselves by engaging in it (whether a white woman debasing her virtue by marrying a black man, or a gay person sending themself to hell). In my opinion, though, these are separate because they hold up poorly to scrutiny. 

----

When we talk about laws, it's important to see what reasons the laws have for existence. Both so we can see if they are agreeable and worth following, but also so that we can understand why *other* people support them and how best to argue against that. 

I strongly believe in personal freedom, and I am not inclined to follow laws which I believe are unjustified, so long as it does not hurt others. **But.** I believe that we cannot so easily lump all ""freedoms"" into one overriding category. Anti-gay laws are not in the same category as smoking laws, which are not in the same category as gun laws. Each restrict personal freedom, but they do it for different reasons, to different extents, and with different classes of societal benefit. One being worthwhile (or not) doesn't mean others are. 

And I say this as a gay, weed-smoking gun owner."

One day I was supervising some kids in between activities. One had a coloring sheet, of some random cartoon character. Another was messing with this kid, and tore a piece off the paper. To make the kid feel better, I made a joke about it, like ""looks like that guy's having a tough day!""... and then the kids started making a game of ripping up the paper and the character on it, and showing me. Like ripping off his legs or his eyes or whatever. Piece by piece while laughing and joking. Saying stuff like ""at least he can't see how bad it is if his eyes are gone"". Meanwhile I'm sitting there like 😧

Keep in mind, these are completely regular kids. But they made a game out of eviscerating some cartoon person, in grisly detail.

Every engine has a minimum octane rating -- putting higher octane than that will do literally nothing.
