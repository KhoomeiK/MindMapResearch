lowspecgamer,fnuijmr,t1_fntflas,1587262920.0,"No in fact the 1050 is faster in games when paired with a decent processor to a PS4. You will get marginally higher fps and if you're using a laptop depending on the specific gpu vendor model the 1050 and a decent processor will even outperform a PS4 Pro in most games. A PS4 gpu is more on-par with a Desktop GTX 660 Ti in terms of what fps in games it would get in such as GTA V and over watch, and other mainstream modern games. The Rtx graphics cards are miles ahead of the technology available in any console right now by many factors but I imagine the Xbox Series X and the PS5 will be on par with the rtx cards. For now though you're still about on par"

For number 2: no rebuttle I agree but I don't think that would be a fun ruiner, I think more of a minor inconvenience 

For number 3: I have no idea how it would work in terms of matchmaking and servers but for me at least I can get into an average patrol in about one minute with four players (on my switch as well as my pc) so I think it would do fine but I'm really not sure... I think server load would increase but I don't see why it would take a large time to load, perhaps like 3 or 4 minutes at Max or so?

Take everything I say with a grain of salt as it was a while ago that I read this but I was reading an article that explained it's possible to control a paralyzed arm or hand with a mechanical controller that makes the arm and hand move. Now the main problem with this is that paralyzed people can't use the controller to control themselves but if we were perhaps able to intercept the nerve signals, send them to the controller and then send it to the paralyzed body part then the paralyzed arm just might work, at least to an extent. If there is a way to intercept brain signals and send them to a controller (which that way has not been found yet), then I would expect something similar to Sword Art Online to be possible. The only question is can they intercept the nerve signals? If so this would lead to great technological advancements for Virtual Reality Gaming, a (potential?) cure for some types of paralysis and many new opportunities. The creator of sword art online had a great idea and I quite possibly believe it is the future."

electronic_cigarette,f9wkngi,t3_e79t6r,1575694178.0,"There's really no type of juice you CANT use for both of them, but some juices generally work better with certain types of systems, and generally saltnics work better with pod systems. There are three main factors when considering eliquids and they are:
1. PG/VG Ratio (I know for the Caliburn Specifically a good ratio is PG/VG : 60/40 or 70/30 although I'd imagine this ratio would be good for the RPM40 Too, as it is a pod system. PG/VG basically is the thickness and the throat hit a juice will give you, in short)
2. Nicotine Levels: Choose what you need. There's two different types of nicotine in eliquids: Freebase (Which generally comes in smaller mg/ml from 3mg/ml - 24mg/ml.) Freebase generally works better in big mods than pod systems, so since your using a pod system I would use salt nics. You should choose an amount that's good for you. Salt nics normally come in 36mg/ml (3.6%) or 50 mg/ml (5%). Recommend you take less nice because uh yeah, pretty self explanatory.
3. Sweeteners: Try to choose less sweet juices with less added sweeteners, these types of juices that are sweet decrease coil life and yeah. They taste good but you're choice.

In short choose a juice based on this if any clarification is needed feel free to ask, any type of juice that works with the Caliburn should work decently with the RPM, if not perfectly. About your other RPM problem, no idea sorry might be a bad pod?

Edit: I mixed up PG/VG please note that I meant VG/PG not PG/VG"

If vaping gets banned and the only thing left is cigarettes people with a nicotine addiction might very well go to cigarettes, as they are of course addicted to nicotine from the vape. Obviously everyone could try to quit both but realistically it's not an option. Vaping helps a lot of people and it's like a 97% better option than smoking.
