AskAstrologers,fqvwjh0,t3_gl79oe,1589686806.0,Mars in the 9th house - fire house. May explain why your anger comes out in a more fiery outwardly expressed way. You feel you are intuitively and spiritually sound in your anger which is more sensitive and informed on an emotional level. You may side step or misdirect your anger rather than confronting what is really emotionally bothering you but when you do it is fiery and outwardly expressed
AskAstrologers,fqvwak9,t3_gkvibp,1589686645.0,you probably have Gemini Venus or moon
schizoaffective,fqvw8oq,t3_gl3fh8,1589686611.0,this is so good hahahah

AskAstrologers,fpw2xal,t3_gfw5va,1588956329.0,If your north node is in 4th house in sag and that places your south node in 10th house in gem with your mars. I actually have north node in 4th and south node in 10th as well except I have Venus and Jupiter conjunct nn in 4th so it‚Äôs more in my personality / nature to be immersed in the energies of the nn while your mars pulls you into the energies of the sn. What I have come to understand about these placements for myself is that it will feel comfortable and familiar to stay in sn tendencies which would be to be career driven and immersed in social activity which brings monetary gain and climbing up the social ladder but it is more fulfilling to my soul to do deep dives into my subconscious realm and be more emotionally driven to build and nurture my family etc. for your chart I would think that your mars would be great for stabilizing your social standing and fulfilling career goals but this will ultimately feel stagnant if you focus on this energy solely for the purpose of climbing the social ladder. If you use your drive and ambition to create stability on the earthly plane it‚Äôs best for your souls health to use the stability and drive as a tool to create a foundation from which you can immerse yourself into a more soulful spiritual place where you connect with your inner emotions and heal yourself to be able to be a nurturing force for yourself and your family... it‚Äôs seems karmic that your mars and mid heaven are with your south node as well like your soul is not ready to release the ambitious nature you have to construct social structures and climb the ranks of society. I feel like a balance would be to go within and meet with your north node soul purpose in order to go about your mid heaven responsibilities in a way that is more fueled by the higher spiritual perspective you receive from diving into your north node rather than just social climbing for the sake of social climbing which could feel empty and trivial with that energy being in Gemini

I would say the best thing you could do is to talk to his mom but be clear with him that you are doing so... that this is your last resort. In the past when my friends have done that with me that caused me to see how severe the situation was and that I needed to open up in some way. But it was harmful if they talked to her before they told me they were going to so I would be clear about that aspect. Thank you much and I hope this situation improves for you and your roommate, and I hope you are well as well!"
schizoaffective,fooeee0,t3_g8jono,1587937475.0,It is useful to have a reality check but the thing about being in a psychotic state is that you are very scared and usually paranoid which is triggering the psychotic symptoms. That‚Äôs how I experience it. It can be very isolating and damaging socially so the best way to push back if you are going to is to really approach it head on from the beginning in a kind and soft way by addressing their emotional well being then bringing up the issues that need to be dealt with in a way that makes them feel like you want to work together to achieve a goal of security and sanity rather than making them feel attacked and like they are doing something wrong

Mediums,fo8a43p,t1_fo7xd2i,1587592666.0,yeah exactly. Maybe you can pray to your ancestors to give you guidance on how you can heal any ancestral wounds in this energy so that you can feel solid and clear in relation to your snake totem and in relation to your spiritual powers (if you don‚Äôt feel solid and clear I am assuming somewhat based on you seeking advice here)
Mediums,fo7qj8r,t3_g633pq,1587582821.0,interesting bc of the legend of snakes getting driven out of Ireland with Christianity. additionally the cross perhaps burned and had a negative or melancholy energy surrounding it bc of the way it was kind of a forced belief system that made other forms of spirituality including witch craft illegal or forced to become secretive and more obsolete. your families history could have burnings far enough back potentially? I‚Äôm not super familiar with the history of what happened to witches in Ireland with the influx of Christianity and colonialism but if it‚Äôs anything like Amerikkka then it‚Äôs highly likely there is much individual nuance in how Christianity was integrated into spiritual belief systems when it was forcefully enforced... meaning some people could have embraced it and others could have rejected it causing rifts between individuals who are close. Something to think about. I hope this is of service in some way and that you continue to find peace with your experience üôèüß°üåï

AskAstrologers,fo6s6ym,t3_g61ssv,1587565706.0,it‚Äôs the last degree of the sign so it may feel like an ending in a way like you are reaching a maximum capacity of the energy of Aries and have learned it‚Äôs lessons - ready for something new. It‚Äôs the wisest expression of the sign as long as you have leaned into learning the energy. It could also indicate something remained unlearned so you paused at the end of the cycle waiting to cross over in Taurus energy. It could help to look up the Sabina symbol for this degree.

AskAstrologers,fo12aec,t3_g4xbsv,1587424317.0,you should look at what sign your Venus is in that will be important for you

AskAstrologers,fo03h8o,t3_g4xbsv,1587405424.0,yes the ruler of your rising sign is your chart dominant for example I have cancer rising so my dominant is moon. another way is to calculate the percentages of intensity (number of aspects) of the planets and whichever is the heaviest aspected is the chart dominant. For example I have moon and Pluto equal dominant in this way

schizoaffective,fnz4r77,t3_g4k3er,1587386033.0,I‚Äôve been trying to keep myself from going off my meds but I‚Äôve been gaining back weight I lost recently which is definitely influenced by my meds making me hungry. I feel like a different person in some ways and the physical part doesn‚Äôt help that but I also can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a bad thing or not. I also feel like part of me is spiraling with food and body image and I can tell if I don‚Äôt make major changes to my diet and exercise routine my weights going to keep increasing. I‚Äôve always been thin so having extra weight is really unusual for me and I have a hard time not fixating on it. also I‚Äôm about to grow out of most of the last of my clothes (I grew out of the rest of them as soon as I started my meds) so that is worrying me because it will be expensive to find replacements. Besides this I‚Äôm doing mostly fine but this takes up a lot of my mental space as you maybe can tell. Wishing everybody the best and healthy recoveries from whatever mental illness had you going through üôè
schizoaffective,fnwrozv,t3_g4cad6,1587324125.0,I would just say enough to what they maybe need to know like it has affected your friendships in the past but you are working on approaching your new friendship from a new standpoint etc. you probably don‚Äôt need to get into all the details unless they come up as you are relating. It may also be helpful to let them know what your triggers are to avoid miscommunications
AskAstrologers,fnpk32a,t1_fnpivhc,1587146883.0,"Scorpio moon, Virgo sun, cap rising?"
AskAstrologers,fnjqvcr,t3_g245s7,1587004889.0,the Venus and ascendant square Pluto could indicate there will be a tug of war between your sense or identity which is tied to your sense of beauty and ability to maintain relationships. If they are not evolved they may seek to control you or their sense of power and control would shake up and cause transformations with this part of yourself. What is interesting is that this means their Pluto likely falls in your nadir or mid heaven so either his Plutonian karma and intuition is connected to your inner soul and world making it a very psychically strong connection or on the other hand this intense energy from them could be affecting your mid heaven / 10th house which would cause transformations in your public life and could affect changes for your career path. Either way it‚Äôs a very karmic bond that is serving you lessons in your identity/sense of pleasure and relationships and your inner emotions (moon). I would say the moon opposite Pluto could definitely cause power struggles and a sense of tug of war between his sense of control/power and your emotional world. But on the other hand if you work through any tangles this aspect could present a very nice balance and lead to a stabilization affect on your emotions by gaining the opposite perspective through the opposition. Either way this connection sounds very karmically fueled with all the Plutonian contacts and will likely bring you great change and great lessons.
lymedisease,fngjz0s,t3_g1fgds,1586934660.0,"look into natural remedies for lyme - I took weeks of antibiotics but was finally able to cure myself of the disease through natural treatments. Specifically using tinctures and teas and homeopathy. 

The herbal remedies that worked best for me were 
Rhodiola rosea for nervous system health 
Cats claw for energy boost and immune system boost (though be careful with this it can aggravate more fiery constitutions) 
Holy basil as an adaptogenic treatment for overall health and stabilization
In tincture form up to 10 drops a day of each but really it‚Äôs up to you to feel out how much your body can take of each tincture"
AskAstrologers,fnezjpa,t3_g191kn,1586898706.0,In my experience mars in the 12th house makes their drive and active energy hard to access in the sense that they have to retreat inward to experience that energy and kind of channel it from a collective spiritual source place that requires them to pull back from interpersonal relationships. They will often not openly express that they need to take this action and kind of passive aggressively pull away from people they are close to in order to self isolate and recharge their battery. I find that people who have this placement may crave the limelight and can find that people are drawn to them interpersonally but find it difficult to have self confidence to step onto a larger stage or find roadblocks to a path to a larger stage. This may be where karma would be stepping in- they are not exactly allowed to be center of attention because there is some service they need to pay to the collective unconscious by being an internal psychic warrior. To be on a world stage would require sacrificing this ambiguous solitary space that is required to do energetic warrior type of actions on a psychic level. I had mars transit through my 12th house and I definitely experienced this as a reality during that time frame so I feel that this is probably an overarching lesson for those who have this placement natal.

lymedisease,fmqhcn2,t3_fwh6sm,1586299630.0,"hey I suffered from short term lyme that I luckily caught early. The antibiotics could be activating dormant lyme organisms that are burrowed in your nervous system and brain cells and causing them to further agitate your nervous system. I recommend going a natural route as soon as your antibiotic prescription is over - as antibiotics do a poor job of penetrating cell walls to get to the lyme bacteria within the cells. 

I recommend rhodiola rosea in tincture form and holy basil in tincture form to help with nervous system functioning and anxiety. I think specifically the rhodiola rosea will really help"
schizoaffective,fmk19s5,t3_fvqtc1,1586142152.0,i have schizoaffective not schizophrenia but the nice thing about meds is that I feel like I can connect with the part of myself that I felt I was before I started to have episodes. The negative part is that sometimes I feel like the meds stifle a certain creativity that came along with feeling insane but at the same time I am more stable and able to work on my projects more consistently and most importantly feel I can interact with other people in a way that doesn‚Äôt make them feel hurt or suffer so that is valuable to me in collaboration and just in relationships generally. I hope you start to feel more like yourself soon and feel comfortable with the meds. For informative purposes I am on vryalr and had to try out a few different meds before I found one I liked.

astrology,fmizc13,t3_fveq86,1586119942.0,the draconic chart is highly dependent upon the north and south node in western astrology- so if you study draconic it is helpful to have a thorough understanding of what the nodes represent in order to read the draconic chart. i mostly read the draconic chart in comparison or as a companion to the natal chart because of its direct connection to the natal chart. its kind of like the relationship between the physical self and the higher self if looking to find a general or simplistic understanding of what the draconic chart represents.

It‚Äôs I do not believe the doctor who told you that the antibiotics can kill the bacteria and the inflamed affects are just sepsis. then there would be a cure and it would not be remission.

So using immune supporters, adaptogens which adapt to your body‚Äôs needs and provide overall support and then providing support for the specific systems being affected by the lyme in your body you allow your body space to breathe and regenerate to overcome the bacteria on its own the way you would on a regular basis when encountering more manageable illnesses"

lymedisease,fky2g50,t1_fky10d8,1584640104.0,"I primarily used rhodiola rosea, holy basil, and cats claw to help with my symptoms.

lymedisease,fkxtur3,t1_fkxo63l,1584635327.0,Also I understand abandoning the western medicine practice could be scary and I am in total support of you doing what feels right for you- however I am surprised specifically in regards to lymes that western medicine has not realized that antibiotics will make it worse especially over long periods of time. That is why I suggest going off antibiotics when you try herbal and energetic treatment.
lymedisease,fkxtm63,t1_fkxo63l,1584635192.0,"If you do herbal medicines simultaneously to being on antibiotics the chances are they will not help because the antibiotics are putting your immune system at a disadvantage. 

what I did to help get rid of the lymes for me: 

First off I should say I had the bullseye rash so I was able to catch the disease fairly early which definitely put me at an advantage in healing. However I think that the main reason why people are enduring such severe symptoms is because of the bogus prescription of antibiotics. If you understand the nature of the disease you realize the only way to get rid of it is to strengthen your immune system as best you can. 

What really helped me and this might sound a little hippyish or out of the realm but for me it really worked was natural medicine and reiki / energy work. 

The reiki and energy work helped me clear my physiological energy which is largely impacted because of the way the disease focuses on burrowing within the brain. Half of the battle is getting your mindset to recover on the same vein as your immune system. 

I know someone who was immobilized and in a wheel chair being treated with antibiotics and then switched to reiki and herbal medicine and is now healed fully. So I know this can work in later stage Lyme treatment as well. 

Anyways the tinctures I used to help my immune system and nervous system functioning were rhodiola rosea, holy basil and cats claw. 

Rhodiola is an extremely useful medicinal plant that supports the functioning of the nervous system and the immune system. I found it to be the most significant help in my recovery. 5 drops in water twice a day. 

Holy basil is an adaptogen that supports the body in whatever imbalance it might be experiencing. I feel this will be very helpful for you as a tool because of its anti inflammatory properties and it‚Äôs protectiveness of the brain which seems to be the most affected aspect of your illness - neurological symptoms. It is extremely useful in supporting mental health in physical and more nuanced ways. 

Cats claw is something I would not necessarily recommend for you because it‚Äôs very fiery and can be overwhelming for some - I mostly used it for treating the lethargy as it boosts immune system and gives a burst of energy. 

Lastly I would recommend olive leaf tincture. This is anti inflammatory, brain and nervous system supporting and has been reported to help in directly curing lymes. It is also an overall immune system booster and will help recover your system from the antibiotics. 

For any tincture I recommend 5 drops once or twice a day. Start out with once a day to see how your body responds and then move from there. However remember if you continue to be on antibiotics this will inhibit your immune system from gaining momentum against the disease and the herbal and energetic healing practices will be thwarted. I would not usually recommend abandoning the more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù types of medicine but in the case of lymes it seems that doctors are completely unaware of the way the disease actually works even though it is common knowledge. 

If all of this fails for you I have heard of a treatment in Mexico where they raise body temperatures to over 106 degrees for over an hour and then inject antibiotics and this is supposedly a remedy that has been working for people to kill the bacteria completely. Perhaps the heat causes the bacteria to escape from within the cells. But this could be expensive and difficult to accomplish at this time because of travel. 

If you would like a more personal or in depth recommendation for herbal tinctures and medicines teas etc that I think will be good for you in specificity which always helps dm me and I will ask some questions to get to know your body type so I can make a more specific suggestion that suits your case and body"
lymedisease,fkxqx4i,t1_fkxi03x,1584633684.0,thanks for the heads up I guess I was introduced to the name as lymes and that‚Äôs what stuck in my head. I had the disease though and don‚Äôt really value colonial nomenclature as a general rule but I‚Äôll try to be respectful of the distinction
indieheads,fkupgph,t1_fkuoj2j,1584553711.0,can‚Äôt wait to hear it ‚ù£Ô∏è
indieheads,fkunf0j,t3_fksvxu,1584552646.0,It would be cool if you did a synth version of pwrls I love that song v much
