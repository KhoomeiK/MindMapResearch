PinkFloydCircleJerk,fpehl2z,t1_fpefw9h,1588547702.0,"Well we can't argue about his skill's. He is a great musitian at the end of the day. He was very influential and was behind some of the songs that i love the most (something that i don't like to admit lol) during the time that the gilmour-waters partnership was in sync. specially he is particularly good in musical arrangements. While Gilmour was the virtuoso that could transform a simple riff into bliss, waters was always behind that somehow. It was only after that that roger's started to imagine a more ""eighties pop"" vision to the band with the lack of depth of the second and third stages of the band (syd barret years beying the first, gilmour the second, gilmour-waters the third and then just waters the 4th). A good example of gilmour beying more attached to pink floyd roots is that he still plays to this day some syd barret songs from his solo album ""opel"" (along with richard wright untill his death) while stupid waters just plays ""the wall"" over and over again with some random musicians. He forgot syd barret's foundation (the mentor and soul of pink floyd even if short-lived) so for the fans of their psychadelic years like me, everything started to feel off. 

You will find many people that are more into the 4th fase because in my opinion those songs are more easy-listening..."

heroin,fotfrtb,t1_fotdxre,1588052645.0,"Wow.. god damn. I can't thank you enough for your time and your testemony. Specially because i know what is like to lurk and never comment on a specific sub. When you do, is because it's important. 

My dad was a drunk/stoner. Eventually my mom also fleed that shit environment. My few memories of him consist of him asking me to put some vinyls of the beatles/pink floyd on the LP thing (well at least he had good musical taste, taking aside the motherfucker that he was) because he was too fucked up to do it himself. That and keep us out of the house into the streets when he was out of himself of course. Fun times.

Still i can't understand your pain. That is something else. I didnt discovered my dad like that. 

What you've said will definetly resonate with me because the more experiences i hear/read the more tools i have to deal with this stupid world. 

I love you too bro, whatever you are. I'll keep strong, one more day."

I have little idea about what i've wrote in there since my moods are all over the place though, but whatever is there is true and consistent. And if you know that i play the piano and write then you absolutely read some shit lol. 

I'm a lurker here also. Basically i lurk in here to keep away my desire to do it. I see the pictures, the different kinds of gear, the different kinds of RoA and so on. That keeps my irl curiosity at bay. 

As i said i've smoked weed/hash for a long time, also everyday. When i stopped the same thing happened to me. Beying irritable, insomniac,  decreased appetite, confusion... you name it. You're right. It will pass (in two weeks and it's only psycological) Alcohol addiction is way different than weed though. Alcohol and downers are a different rodeo. I don't know what my main point is anymore."

depression,f8rp4f6,t3_e1tfi1,1574747368.0,"I needed to read this today. It made me feel less guilty. I too fail to find the strenght to improve my situation. I repeat old patterns  (although i don't expect any changes so at least im not crazy ha-ha) and i just dwell, observe, suffer, despair, and avoid. I'm starting to see this as part of my complex condition and not a constant flaw, although i'm mildly wrong about this because i could at least force myself to the maximum to at least catch some sunlight. It's been a month now. 

Anyway, im utterly sad, broken and mediocre in the fucked up and fake comfort that i find in my constant disconfort, and i see no end to this. 

I relate."
depression,f8roci8,t1_f8dzfr7,1574746571.0,"Sadly nothing is going relatively well as of right now (and for years) in my end, and my mind is constantly over-whelmed by the same old thoughts. I've been bed ridden for years with the most horrible form of living and feeling, and despite beying able to leave my bed in october of last year and starting doing something, it was just the beguinning of another hypomanic state, and now, less than one year later, the crash came and i'm in the exact same situation. This will be a endless cycle, i presume, and i don't know if i will acept years of bed-ridden desperation with just somewhat erratic but happy months of ""living"" here and then. Balance, they say. Stability can be found - well, i can't find any.

My point was slightly different, although you've understood it. I was not seeking the flawd thinking of ""my depression/state"" is worse than yours - but i can't help but beying a little... tired of posts like ""i didnt got out of bed today. Life feels so empty"" or (and this one i saw personally) a girl that was threatening suicide because her mom didn't allow her to dye her hair blue. I mean... c'mon people... It saddens me in the way that ""depression"" and ""suicide"" and such terms are throwned away so lightly. Some folks come to this subs in desperation, trying to relate to someone, even if its just through a stupid little screen, and 80% of things are... for a lack of a better word, just overly-dramatic. 

I'm not sayin that this should not be a place to vent - regardless of the issue - but (as an hypotectical example) i wouldn't have the guts to complain about a small migraine to a person that just been in a car accident that left him/her half paralised and drooling. 

Maybe i sound selfish? I've been reading through some of your responses and you sure have great insights with some nice english terms and words that im not familiar with. I'm not an native-speaker and i learned it by myself. So that was refreshing. 

Thanks."

depression,f8rkrr1,t3_e1s5zi,1574743195.0,"It's a great trade-off! I'm still on the binge drinking-netfllix-watching everyday though... So your previous state. I hate it, but i still dont have the strenght to change it and i don't know to what i could change. I'm glad you did it. 

I dont think that your walks are obsessive. You may now think more about doing them, but they are healthy. Beying obsessive would be walking all day/night in erratic patterns, i guess. We all need a replacement from previous habits. And 1 to 2 hours seems reasonable to me. Wouldn't make sense to leave the house to walk down the road for 20 min and then coming back, barely warming up. In order to achieve that relief and negative thoughts blockage that you've mentioned, they really have to be longer i guess.

I know a few runners and they usually run at least 1 hour. The same for hicking, etc..."
bipolar,f8hm64h,t3_e0qy8q,1574576742.0,"I also love the felling! I feel so great and with the ability to get everything done and engage with everybody. I'm the coolest and i have energy that atracts people. But then i start to be so erratic and the crash is always so fucking hard and it takes years to recover (i dont change moods that quick) that  for me beying the coolest and having plans and trips and friends and a different girl every weekend during some months its not worth staying in bed for years after that.

But if i had to choose i would prefer to be manic all the time because at least i'm having fun and not laying in my bed wanting to end it all but without the courage to do that also."
bipolar,f8hkwyd,t3_e0pcbq,1574576186.0,"It happened to me. After more than one year without barely leaving my bed (after a big crash from a previous huge manic state) i slowly started to feel better. I started to go out and do stuff. Reconnect with friends and doing some work. I went on a few travels which i thought it would be impossible because just a few months earlier i almost didnt had the energy to go to the bathroom. 

I also wasnt spending like crazy, lacking sleep or starting unrealistic projects, and everybody commented that i was stable (like you, i was very self-aware and kind of afraid of this new found joy) and i was enjoying the fact that i was making for all the time wasted in bed. But then, slowly, just the fact of beying happy became a trigger to be more happy, if that makes sence. And then the erratic behaviour started. The sensless projects, the fast talking and lack of sleep, the works.. 

And now im in bed again, another crash. I guess what i'm trying to say is for you to be alert..."

As i said if RDJ wants and asks me personally for the account back i am more than open to provide it. If it is to give it back to some poser or A REAL inpersonator wanna-be, then no...
