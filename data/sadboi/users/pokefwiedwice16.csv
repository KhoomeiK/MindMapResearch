Read Gov. Cuomo and Commissioner Oxiris Barbot’s tweets from early on of this outbreak- until the second of week of March, they were continuing to encourage their citizens to lead normal lives and attend parades and other social gatherings.  Barbot didn’t even think they needed to stockpile masks.  They even tweeted you were more likely to catch the flu than this virus and Cuomo kept tweeting that NY had a very low chance of getting the virus.  They were still denying the dangers of the virus while others were saying shelter in place, etc., and they were telling their citizens to not listen to the misinformation about the virus.  There has been failure at all levels of this pandemic across the country.  

I live in OH and at first Dr. Acton had said we were looking at about 100k deaths from this, now they’re projecting 500.  Huge fkn difference.  Whether their earlier models were way off or DeWines early orders of stay at home actually worked and saved a lot of people, I dunno.  Dr. Acton is going to do a press conference this week with a new model for OH.  But even TN is now projecting lower deaths too.  So we shall see how this all turns out.  I just hope it ends soon!

Imagine being wrong all this time and the MSM and left being right about the Right and conservatives being Nazis and the party of the racists ~ I am speaking of America of course because of the sub.  Damn
healthcare,fmfgsp4,t1_fmff4ec,1586026929.0,"I can’t believe you’re comparing HCW to veterans.  Pick something different besides veterans, a lot went to war, suffer from PTSD and many, many commit suicide each day, suffer from addiction and are homeless where our government doesn’t give a crap about them.  The VA system sucks and is practically a joke.  Wow, they get free college!  Did you know they actually contribute to their own GI Bill?  And I bet there are a lot of ppl who went through nursing school that didn’t have to pay for it.  

Yes the situation really sucks right now and nobody was prepared.  There’s one state who even said early on that there was no need to “stockpile masks” and they’re hurting right now.  But there’s literally NOTHING anybody can do right now!  Manufacturers are trying their best to make as many as they can.  And like 3M they can only make so many at a time and they sell worldwide!  So who do they tell NO to?  You can’t get blood out of a turnip."

moderatepolitics,fmf268u,t1_fmf1g4i,1586018431.0,Read her tweets where I had mentioned her tweeting the first 2 months of the outbreak where she was encouraging ppl to go to parades and IGNORE the “misinformation being said about the coronavirus” she also said there was no reason for NY to stockpile masks and other supplies!  Cuomo also kept telling his citizens that NY was safe and had very little chance of becoming infected!  I’ve got the screenshots I took myself in case they decide to delete them.  It’s on Twitter.
darkjokes,fmf1ksw,t1_fmf133k,1586018091.0,Too lazy to get educated? Got it!  No it’s not the definition of Nazi.  If you read it you’d understand what I was saying.  It’s what I learned in microbiology- viruses are a natural selection to humanity- we created viruses to stop them.  Easier for you to comprehend?
darkjokes,fmf19ke,t1_fmf0m40,1586017909.0,"Just saying what I was told in microbiology.. that viruses are a natural form of natural selection.  And it’s no different if someone was an anti-vax, of which I am not."
darkjokes,fmf0wre,t1_fmezp0j,1586017700.0,"You’re not using the term genocide correctly.. genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group.  Can also be a political group.  (Wiki) There’s nothing that says it’s from a virus; now if the virus was man made and intentionally released for the sole purpose of killing a certain population, then I would call it a genocide.  

Now, yes when I was taking microbiology, that’s what was discussed.  And because we as humans feel the need to save everyone because it’s humane, we’ve disrupted that cycle.  Viruses are a natural population control, but we’ve found ways to stop that.  If we hadn’t, we wouldn’t have the population we do today.  It’s ironic because ppl are complaining that we are too populated, that we need not to have so many children, all this to save the Earth, but yet we keep creating vaccines to save everyone.  It’s interesting actually.  

I for one am for vaccines, I get them and encourage them.  So do we keep living life, having children, populating the Earth, creating vaccines to save lives, or do we let nature take its course like its intended and see what happens?  Less population is better for the environment and could possibly save Earth, according to scientists and SJW.  :)"
