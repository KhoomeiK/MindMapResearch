It’s been my ritual to go grab some every morning before I head to work/school, and I really adore saying hello to the baristas that work there, but guess what? I also decided that my coffee needs were not important enough to endanger other people’s lives. I wish people would stop acting so selfish. 


And I also hope his coffee tasted like shit."

AskReddit,fhmfqvc,t3_f3rzsm,1581712144.0,Mostly just trying to find clothes that fit. I basically can’t wear rompers because they’re never long enough. If I go a size up in a skirt then sure it’s a little longer but now the waist is too big so it falls down. If I go up a size in jeans they might fit better in the butt and thigh area but I’ll have a huge gap with the waist and wearing a belt just bunches it up against me. Dresses that are supposed to hit like mid-thigh or above the knee become dangerous if it’s windy or just straight up unwearable :( I just want to go shopping and find clothes that fit and don’t make me feel self-conscious all day.
CPTSD,ffsgy82,t3_euoi1k,1580181449.0,"You need to call the police. I know it is very scary, but trust me you do not want to wait for this to escalate. What he has done to you already is horrible, and it is sexual assault.

My Dad did those things, and he raped and molested me. I didn’t ever reach out to anyone because I was scared. I was worried no one would believe me. I was worried I’d be put into a worse position than I already was, and I was worried about how others around me would react. But I wish I had done something. It’s taken me a long time and a lot of therapy to get where I am now and it was a hellish ride. 

You’ve already been hurt by him. I’m sorry that you’re having to make these tough decisions when you’re so young. But you have to get away from him. Reach out to other adults you trust. Call the police and explain what’s been happening to you. Call CPS, talk to and call anyone you possibly can and do not let them ignore you. You can do this."

It only occurred to me a few days ago that maybe the wavy side of the pin should be facing down, because how else is the pin supposed to stay in. It’s been life changing. I just thought bobby-pins kind of sucked and that’s why I had to use like 7-10 of them but nope, I’m just a moron. I even googled it after to see if I have truly been using them wrong my whole life and it turns out I have.

tl:dr I’ve been using bobby-pins wrong for like 12 years."
AskReddit,f7hr7qy,t3_dw18l9,1573746035.0,"Not sure how this started but: Basically one of us will say “I love you!” And the other person will say “Nope, love you more!”, and the first person will say “Come on now, let’s not argue.” and tap the other persons body. Then we essentially fight to “tap” the other person last while saying “Quiet down please, thank you!” “Come on now!” with the taps getting more ridiculous as we go along like, I’ll tap his nose like 5 times while saying “Shhhh. Quiet please.” It basically ends whenever one person starts laughing or gives up."
ptsd,f7hgl1l,t3_dw47dw,1573740227.0,"I literally can’t stand the whole “weed cures everything!” crowd. It’s great that it can work very well for so many people, that’s amazing. But when someone tries to shame me for taking my anti-depressants, etc, and offers weed up as a holy grail, I get so incredibly angry. I’ve smoked weed, a lot of it. Different types. I literally grew up around people that grew it, sold it, and smoked it. I’m very familiar with weed/edibles/etc. For me, it doesn’t work. It makes my anxiety worse. I get panicked and nauseous. It makes my symptoms worse. What has worked for me is intense therapy and SSRIs and medication to help with sleep. 

I know my own body. I know what works and what doesn’t. If someone tells you that something doesn’t work for them, believe them. They know better than you do because it’s literally their body. Don’t interrogate people about their medical history or drug usage (weed OR prescribed medication). It’s rude, and can make people uncomfortable and upset."

ptsd,ev3cw7h,t3_ci9rky,1564192969.0,"I’m going through EMDR right now! It’s not as scary as you think it will be!

I’m in charge of what we tackle when I do EMDR. For instance, I’ve had a particularly hard time with a specific traumatic event and how it made me feel, so we worked on that one a few times. Other times I focus on a negative belief about myself or negative emotions I have and work on that. 

When I have a session I’m usually sitting on a couch, and my therapist is across from me in a chair (not especially close or anything), and I hold two small grey dots in each hand, which vibrate back and forth. You might not use these. Before I used these my therapist just used her fingers and I followed them. We discuss what I want to work on and we try to label everything and determine how distressing it is for me. Then we focus on what I’m feeling and thinking when I bring up those memories and feelings. She turns on the buzzers, etc. we repeat that until the memory or feeling doesn’t come up anymore? Basically? This last part is hard to explain.

Basically, just try to let yourself relax and remember you’re safe. I won’t lie, EMDR can be difficult sometimes. It can be very emotional and hard, but I feel like it has helped me SO MUCH. I’m sorry if this is all over the place, it’s hard to really explain it I guess? Feel free to PM me with any questions and I can try to answer them!

Edit: I forgot to add that your experience might differ a little from mine. There are different ways to do it but overall it’s the same thing. Your therapist is utilizing that rapid eye movement, which gets different parts of your brain involved to try to take the traumatic memory from being stuck in that “flight or fight” response, to being successfully processed in your brain. (As I understand it?)"

When I had my first apartment I ended up getting myself into a position where I knew I was gonna have to ask one of my parents to bail me out (I stupidly got caught in a payday loan cycle), I needed about $200 and when I asked my Dad I was sobbing and apologizing for being such a dumbass.
