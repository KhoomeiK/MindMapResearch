SuicideWatch,fbg3mgv,t3_ed5lki,1576832672.0,"Unfortunately, the answer is kinda complicated, yet also kinda simple. What makes life worth living is ultimately a personal discovery. What motivates some may not work for others. Some are lucky and find their purpose early on, some think they've found it and later realize they were mistaken, and others spend their entire lives looking without success. The only way to know which camp you fall into is to keep living. Of course, my nihilistic brain will also say that regardless of whether or not you find your passion, nothing matters in the end anyway, so do what you want. 
As for why we should/shouldn't be able to choose when/how we die, well, I believe that we should be allowed the autonomy to off ourselves whenever we so wish, just so long as the method doesn't harm anyone other than ourselves in a physical manner. The only reason suicide is looked down upon is because it goes against societal norms. People still like to preach about the sanctity of life, while caring little to nothing about the wellbeing of their fellow man.
Another interesting point to make: I don't believe that most people find death so alluring because of it's inevitability. If society actually gave a damn about improving the quality of life for its citizens, then maybe so many people wouldn't see death as a sweet release"
