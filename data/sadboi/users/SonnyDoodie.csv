Some advice: 
Trust your nurse/doctor. Do what they say and call them if you have concerns. 
You can’t truly prepare other than maybe some ibuprofen (or similar) before to take the edge off.  Clear your schedule for a day or two. Try not to do it before you have to be at work or a party or something. 
This process is slow and you won’t see results in a week. 
Give it at least a month between pictures taken. I only take pictures right before a session so I know I gave it as long as possible before comparing to my last picture. I literally take the picture while sitting in the chair in front of the machine lol
Be sure to give enough time between sessions. I go for 12 weeks. It may seem all healed up, but trust me your body isn’t done with it. 
Itching is normal even after it’s “healed”. 
It’s pretty cool to watch a tattoo fade.

It is bearable but to me it hurt worse than getting the tattoo. However the sessions are really fast. Especially for a small tattoo you could expect probably 30-45 seconds of laser IBF and then you’re done. 
Keep in mind though everyone is different and the placement of the tattoo matters too. Same as getting the tattoo, some areas hurt more than others. 
Even though it hurts, I continue to go back for more sessions because in the end it’ll be worth it."

Because sometimes I was either just reading and she’ll guilt trip me OR it’s something a parent doesn’t need to know about (wink). Sooo maybe in retrospect she is a contributing factor to the anxiety...... oh dear, literally typing that out made me realize this. 

Anyway, something I tried about not responding to texts right away is to not apologize. So instead of responding and saying “sorry I was tied up at work” or “sorry I’m at the gym text ya later” just respond to the message and leave sorry or an explanation out of it.  You’ll gradually see most people don’t even notice or make a comment (unless they are my mom)."

running,flo21vz,t3_fpwsbe,1585330174.0,"This is what I experienced when I started my running journey a year ago and I hope it helps you: 

I had the idea that I had to run the entire way or else I had failed. That is absolutely untrue. Once I implemented a run/walk interval I started to THRIVE.  I had a whole new outlook. I start to run for 2/3/4 minutes and then walk for 2 minutes. Push through the running and look forward to the break. That’s how I was able to add on mileage to my distances. And eventually you start with the run/walk but after a while you’ll start to feel like you can push longer on the running interval. And you just grow from there.

Something to always always remember no matter what your fitness level: there will be good days and there will be bad bad bad days. Just don’t stop because starting over sucks!"
TattooRemoval,flelgrz,t1_flegaia,1585086658.0,Definitely wait longer between sessions. I do 12 weeks. I highly suggest getting dermablend to cover your tattoo. It takes practice and lots of patience but it’s so worth it.  Practice using it a few times. I always put it on and wait 30 minutes to an hour for it to completely dry. And let me tell you it looks terrible during the drying process. Also you can layer it.  But once it’s dry you can put your own make up over it to help blend it in with your natural skin. And to finish spray hair spray over it.

3) hair spray the area after you’ve got it all blended.
