Psychic,fl6rf7e,t3_fmwub3,1584880947.0,Does anyone have any insight into what it is? I'm feeling it too but can't tell if it's a good or bad thing coming
Psychic,fl6rbm1,t3_fmy3ze,1584880849.0,It's mother's Day in England
BPD,fkbaw7k,t3_fhhwvo,1584029554.0,"I don't have any. I'm honestly super happy about it! I don't have to fake anything, feel forced to meet up or engage in awkward conversation. I felt like a weirdo for years because I didn't want friends. Now I totally embrace it, I love my own company."
BPD,fkbaorh,t3_fhaj6k,1584029442.0,Yes! I've put it down to these reasons- At the beginning we are the best partners and we tend to have a great sense of humor- this is always attractive.
Marriage,fk4az4t,t1_fjzf2ml,1583856893.0,Because we are both at University and wanted to fast track our degrees. Seemed like a sensible option at first.
Marriage,fk4awpx,t3_ffijdq,1583856856.0,"I didn't share my location with them. Well, I did but not intentionally. My location was on, it's now off. I never thought they would use it to track me. Im guessing it's through our shared family plan or Facebook etc. I've now turned the location settings off."
Psychic,fjwopck,t3_ff35ty,1583642089.0,"Six years ago, I was on holiday and walked into a small shop for a psychic reading. She told me that the love of my life was going to ""ride in on a white horse"" I would know when he is there because I would be infatuated. She said she saw me living in USA. She also said a male would die and I would devastated. Fast forward three years and I went for another reading, she told me that again, I would move to USA and live in a house on a hill. She also said I would retrain and have a fantastic career helping others. I always thought I would be an occupational therapist as that was my dream when I asked her if it was occupational therapy, she said no, it's not medical field BUT, it is a field of helping others challenged in some way. It all came true. Except for the house on a hill. A very close male friend committed suicide, I met the love of my life and moved to USA. Also I'm studying to become a special education teacher, which was never my plan, I just fell into it."
DentalHygiene,fjnx40m,t1_fjnboor,1583516076.0,"My husband thinks because I am a cash patient they are trying to get more money out of me. I'm going to seek a second opinion from another dental surgery. 
Yes that is exactly why I need it. I needed my wisdom teeth out for around four years. As a result the socket is huge."
Depop,fj8c4e1,t3_fc0ib9,1583109928.0,"Yes, it looked really cute"
Depop,fj8c16o,t3_fc3k7n,1583109870.0,"I edit items multiple times a day to reshare them. After a couple of weeks, I take new and more exciting photos. My items are really fairly priced unless it's a really special item. I have over 100 items listed at any one time. I have an Instagram where I advertise what I have listed, admittedly I don't have many followers but I've noticed a drive in sales. I never get promoted to the main page so I really have to put the work in. I also finds it helps to list postage for as cheap as you can, buy some shipping scales so you can sell lighter items and only charge first class postage. Saves $3 each time and makes items more appealing. It's been a long road. Over a year to start seeing improvements in sales. But it has been worth it."
BPD,fj883mc,t3_fc0x6j,1583107247.0,"Yes definitely! I feel like BPD can make me act a bit childlike, with the tantrums and stuff. I have a real bond with kids and animals and I feel like they gravitate towards me also."
BPD,fj5un43,t3_fbo9ft,1583043732.0,I dissociatiate a lot! The way I snap myself out of it is to set alarms on my phone for an hour's time. There's no other way for me to come out of it.
BPD,fj5ujvh,t3_fbowgt,1583043634.0,"I used to feel like this. But I realized that socializing had negative impacts on me and it made me so anxious that it's just not worth it to me. I spend a lot of time alone, but I'm happier that way. I just faced the facts and I've never looked back. 
We do deserve to live. We are outcasts yes. You just have to make the best of the situation. It's hard but you have to live. As I'm getting older, I do feel as if I have been ""gifted"" with BPD. As much as it sucks. I feel so unique and that I am grateful for."
BPD,fj1bglh,t3_fayyqp,1582916591.0,I've had similar feelings. But then when im in a relationship all I want is to be alone. I can't win either way.
BPD,fikqbl1,t3_f886l3,1582485236.0,"I absolutely can relate to this. I've been running my whole life. I came from a small town in England, I now live in California. Like you, I have traveled the world. Nowhere feels or has felt like home. I hope one day it will happen. For now though, I just go with the flow. Nothing ever feels comfortable. I start a job and when I become anxious (usually after six months to a year) I just quit. It's not worth me having panic attacks. I just start again. It's not the most productive way to live my life, but it's better than stressing myself to the point where I'm having panic attacks. I'm in online school right now with no deadlines and I can work at my own pace. It seems to be working for me and I'm sticking to it. A physical school would send my social anxiety into overdrive. Once I have my degree im already planning to move on."
Psychic,fh4awsf,t3_f1cmy9,1581276881.0,This sounds great. I sent a message thank you :)
BPD,fgoeumc,t1_fgnna9l,1580967603.0,"No, I totally get it! That's the exact reason I got promoted. I would work really hard every shift out of fear that the management would look down on me or god forbid tell me what to do. I notice things a lot of other people don't because my BPD makes me obsessive. I feel like a fraud for getting promoted. But I am already doubting myself. I've felt quite panicky about it, but it is what I wanted and I am proud of myself. So I have to push past any negative thoughts I'm having and just do the best job I can. I can totally relate to a promotion sending you into a tailspin."
BPD,fgnhnnt,t1_fgna2di,1580945089.0,I ended up getting tongue tied and then just feel so stupid.
DentalHygiene,fgm8yk8,t3_eqtzq2,1580920141.0,Probably have some gum disease. It's best to see a dentist to get that pulled out before further problems arise. I left mine for years and my teeth are in a right mess and it's ended up costing me thousands.
DentalHygiene,fgm8jwy,t3_evb5f1,1580919948.0,"Instead of mouthwash use hydrogen peroxide 3% from target. It's 97c for a huge bottle which lasts ages. I have periodontal disease and use it twice a day. It says you can use it up to four a day, but I don't feel the need too as it works so well. It's a miracle product for breath."
DentalHygiene,fgm80vf,t3_exzn66,1580919696.0,"Crest strips are amazing for the price! Be careful where you buy them though, most on eBay are out of date and don't work."
DentalHygiene,fgm7x36,t3_eza804,1580919645.0,"I had the same. Keep up with 3 monthly visits to the hygienist. I had an initial deep clean procedure which has stopped the bleeding. The best and I mean the best and only product I have used which has stopped the breath, is hydrogen peroxide. A huge bottle is 97c in target! It kills bacteria and you can feel that it's worked. Other branded mouthwashes do not work for periodontal disease no matter how much they claim too. Long term they don't do anything."
BPD,fgg9pgh,t1_fgg3nka,1580757265.0,"That's exactly how I feel, like I'm doing both. In a few months time I kind of ""wake up"" and realise that ive not really been present and I've lost huge chunks of time. I've tried different things like, setting phone alarms to bring me into the present but it still happens."
BPD,fgg1y7y,t3_ey6wga,1580752480.0,I guess we only act like that out of fear of abandonment. Partners and close family are the ones we are scared of losing the very most.
BPD,ffppcb1,t1_ffgdwk8,1580101103.0,"Customer service roles are definitely the most anxiety triggering for me. I've been at my job well over a year and I just got promoted, I still have near panic attacks before work and I worry about going in. The promotion has only escalated my feelings."
BPD,ffpp9nr,t1_ffgx2dv,1580101035.0,Any job would make me feel that way.
Marriage,fdgylc0,t1_fdfeb98,1578411488.0,"I have done all of those things, multiple times. That's why I posted because I've tried everything to no avail. I'm out of my depth with him."
Marriage,fdg7so2,t3_ekt4qi,1578383607.0,"Thanks for all the responses. Some great advice In here, most of which confirmed what I was already thinking. I've decided to have a talk with him about getting a job with a timeframe on it. If he doesn't get one, I'm moving out and moving on. I love this guy but at the end of the day, I'm not his mother and I'm not happy to play that role. I'm going to be honest ,but firm and make sure he understands the severity of the situation."
aspergers,fdeyyjb,t3_ekyc51,1578349587.0,"Is it possible to speak to a counsellor at college about your concerns with your studies? You mentioned you were married, are you able to confide in her and explain how you are feeling?"
Marriage,fder9br,t1_fdeb3jp,1578344947.0,"It's crazy, because I read your story and I'm screaming inside that you need to give her an ultimatum and if she doesn't do it, then leave. I also want to say that you are worth more. Yet, I am in the same situation pretty much and I don't tell myself those things. I'm thinking ""he will change for me"". When I'm thinking ""your wife won't change"". Its ruthless that she says those things to you about getting a second job etc. Sounds like she's comfortable having you work your butt off for her. It doesn't feel right for me to give advice, as I'm in the same sad situation and I have no answer to it right now. Well, I do! We deserve more than what we are getting right now. We set the bar for the how we want to be treated."
Marriage,fdefvo7,t1_fdefnie,1578338134.0,"I honestly don't know. I ask myself the same things. I asked him you know, is it that he's lost his confidence etc? He just says no he will get a job when he's ready too."
Marriage,fdefezl,t1_fde4vgx,1578337843.0,"He doesn't do anything but sit on his phone watching YouTube, plays playstation or watches tv. He will go out to eat and to see friends. His life depresses the crap out of me. I couldn't live like that. But I'm a person who's always had to work, because if I don't I go insane."
Marriage,fdef5qo,t1_fdeeqeo,1578337682.0,"No, he used to work and be really motivated. That was what attracted me, was that our motivation and goals in life were the same."
Marriage,fdedd39,t1_fde7guc,1578336562.0,"I don't want out but the future definitely depends on him getting a job. It's a lot of pressure on me and him not working has taken the fun out of it for me, for both of us! I feel like he should WANT to work for our future, because that's how I have always felt. I've wanted to work for us. But I didn't think I would be doing that alone, I thought it would be a 50/50 partnership. I thought I was being supportive when I agreed that he should take a year off to focus on study, but now it's gone way beyond that."
Marriage,fddllap,t1_fddhczp,1578316908.0,"Oh definitely. It's a slap in the face because I work and go to school. My degree is kicking my butt right now, but I'm grafting so hard for it. I guess I don't understand why he doesn't WANT to work. I go stir crazy if I don't work and I'm at home all day. It's turning me off so much. I definitely do feel like his mom!!"
