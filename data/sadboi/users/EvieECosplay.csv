thanksimcured,fphbf2b,t3_gdcd6k,1588618281.0,"I recently got taken off my medications because after 6+ years and numerous different cocktails it hasn't helped me. And OH BOY!! let me tell you that was hell, and I was being weaned off of it by a doctor and my husband is a nurse which helped with monitoring. 

And even though medication has not helped me I believe whole heartedly that it does work for some people. The big issue is that no two brains are alike or will even react exactly the same to a given medication. 

The only ""good"" thing I can see in the OG post is something I think was unintentional. As I was reading the post it seemed like they might be suggesting developing a routine. Again I dont think this was 100% intentional, but routine and schedule is helpful (even for neurotypical people). 

For me, the routine I have developed around my new bunny and my cats helps me a lot. The rabbit more then the cats as he needs a more structured schedule and so do I. I'm bad at doing these things for myself but I can do it for the bunny and then it helps me too. 

Idk if I've helped at all or not, I'm sorry you have to deal with people that think this way. Please always talk to a doctor before doing anything with your medication."

pagan,fja5dsd,t3_fcdogt,1583166733.0,"What I tend to do is think of all the horrible things the Christian God has done. When I think about it this way, along with all the good people that would be condemned to hell for not being Christian (like Gandhi) to me it becomes clear that the Christian God is a much darker God then he claims to be. And if that is the only god I do not want to please him and be in his 'heaven'. So I'll be chilling with all the other good people that ended in hell."

If you can't see another doctor then you only option is to really press you current doctor. Make it clear that these symptoms are heavily affecting your quality of life and then you need help managing them better."
mentalillness,fcsub1t,t3_eiqbt7,1577925291.0,"I've had this from my meds and its hell. Honestly my only advice is too go to sleep and wait for it too pass. Take something to help you sleep if you need to, and sleep through it. 

If it is lasting longer than that then try to go into a walk-in clinic, or book a doctor's appointment and talk to them about it. 

Vertigo is serious, you shouldn't drive, or operate machinery. And it can have serious long term side effects. If it persists, please speak to your doctor. 

Wishing you the best and that it just passes with some sleep"

mentalhealth,fcabvtn,t3_eguu0u,1577566393.0,"Go in and explain your symptoms, both physical (tired all the time or can't sit still etc.) As well as psychological symptoms. Say you know you need help and want to look into medication. They will likely have you fill out some questionnaires as well, as they are a good way to measure improvement in the future. 

Set up a doctor's appointment for 4-6 after starting the new medication, there can be serious negative side effects and they will pop up before positive effects. 

It might take a while to fine what works for you, but dont give up, and if you notice something that was working is no longer go back in and talk about it. 

I have been fighting for 6 years to find the rode medication combination, but it is worth it. 

The best advice I've gotten ever was from my doctor how said. 

""When you feel like you don't need the pills anymore, they are working."""

My advice is to try and reach out to someone, someone you trust that might understand. Talking about how you feel, it's a good way to bond. The people I am close too that I wouldn't be able to drop like others are the ones I talk to about my problems. They make me feel understood and that helped to form a comfortable bond with them."

PS2 - Final Fantasy 12 (yes its trash, but its MY trash) 

PSP - Persona 3

PSVita - Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth

mentalillness,fc1hzii,t3_efk98p,1577319346.0,"So I have this combination, and its hell to find meds for, I have spent 6 years struggling with different pills. 

What I can tell you is the mood-stablizers are super important. For the anxiety and PTSD maybe ask you doctor about adding a SNRI in to your mix. 

My 'cocktail' is 4 different meds currently. 

Other advice I can offer is to cut out alcohol, I get bad vertigo now from the mixing of meds and alcohol but in general alcohol is not good with these kind of meds"
