I'm not sure if you're in the same inner turmoil I am, but whatever you're facing, just remember:
No journey is easy, that may be true. But the destination isn't the goal, it's the things along the way that you fight for. The good times fade, but they'll always come back.

They'll come back."
schizoaffective,fklx8mx,t1_fklw11a,1584316575.0,"Ah, okay. I'll look into it. Honestly, I know a lot about myself and the way I function. I've even learned how to identify when I'm entering psychosis. 

My therapist says I'm dangerous because I've become.. I don't know how to put it, but basically I'm fully functioning, never skipping a beat. As long as there are physically people around me that I know are real, and I don't often see people that aren't and I can somehow tell when they're not, I'm basically just normal on the outside. I call it customer service mode, because my whole life has been like my work experience in customer service. A mask for someone or other. I don't remember much now days, due to repressed memories, but from what I do remember? As young as being in foster home, even before the ones who raised me adopted me, it’s always been a show of, “I am perfect.” I’m a chameleon lost in a world of delusion and fear. My daily life is basically me being stuck in fight or flight. I have good memories, yes, but the bad heavily outweighs it to the point of it being expectation. Basically, I know what’s wrong with me, I know methods of coping, I know what to do. But I’ve made my own emotions inaccessible, pushed down and crumbled up into a little ball of silent self-hatred and fear of being hurt. So I’ve basically just been running my whole life. I’ve literally never faced anything, never tried to grieve anything. I’m stuck. There’s so much shit i need to try and let go of, that when I was finally shown love, felt that feeling, & started to open up, & try to touch my emotions after 18 years? I became toxic and ruined the only thing I’ve ever cared about. The trauma of that just kind of.. shot me into my disorder. Before, I was a robot. Felt nothing, loved no one, cared about nothing. Now I’m.. shutting down, confused, lost. 

I’m so sorry, this all just like came out of nowhere"
