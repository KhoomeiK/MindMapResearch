I believe in you, because I didn’t think I was going to even be able to go, and I did, and you will too, and it will go better than you expect. This person deserves to rot in jail for what they did to you and others. You can do this, for yourself and for the others who have suffered in silence. 
My advice is be as honest and genuine as you can, and even if it sounds cheesy, the truth always shines through.

If what you’re worried about is seeing the person, you should probably have a screen in front of you so that you can’t see them. If your mental health is going to impact you, talk to your psychiatrist and get them to give you something to relax you which you can take before going in, this is what I did.

Good luck, you can do this, we all believe in you."

I think the objective of the show should be to make it entertaining and comprehensible to all of its viewers, not just the ones well versed in the whole Witcher lore (books + games)

The series just moves too quick and doesn’t explore important points like relationships between characters (they’re extremely forced let’s face it).

This is the best way ive found to intensify the effects of K. Another well known tip is drinking a bunch of grapefruit juice, but I tried that and it just made the high very weird hahaha"
ketamine,f7ejxqz,t3_dvbj41,1573659339.0,"I’ve had quite a bit of experience with K. I’ve done very high doses (up to 1g in an hour or so), which have left me high as all fuck but still able to function more or less ok. For a lot of people, doing too much k leads to K-holing, where your muscles become wobbly and you’re probably gonna end up on the floor, meanwhile you lose consciousness and your mind travels. Some people go for this state on purpose. I’ve personally never had it because I’m a fairly big guy and have a big tolerance for drugs in general.

The reason I and I spose other people do K is because it makes you feel amazing. Imagine all of the physical pain in your body you carry around without noticing, somehow just disappears. Your head feels light and your body feels rejuvenated, energised. Everything is much more hilarious and you start to chat so much shit. And then it only lasts for 1h. I see this as a good thing because regardless of how fucked you are, I’ll be over in 1h tops. K also forces some sort of out of body experience on you due to its dissociative qualities, and even if it sounds bad it makes you forget about all of your problems for a while. This is also why it’s being researched heavily in relation to treating depression. In my own experience, a line of K has been able to completely get me out of a major depressive episode (I have ultra fast cycling bipolar 2), and something which normally would have lasted 1-2h during which I’d feel heavily suicidal and extremely depressed, faded within minutes. Personally I see this as a bit of a plus for me, but that’s just anecdotical"

ketamine,f7eil7a,t3_dvcted,1573658460.0,"I’d say I have a pretty good tolerance for K. I’ve been able to clear 0.4g of very good quality K in one line. I bring this up to explain that I’ve never really ‘k-holed’ as such. Whenever I’ve been extremely ketty, I’ve still been able to function more or less ok. I could still walk, albeit not perfectly but well enough. I’ve also borderline tripped with K (did .7 of good quality K).

My friends however have all k-holed. Sometimes I’ve been there. What they describe are both good and bad things tbh. One of my friends thought she was a fish and was gonna drown, so she kept saying she needed to swim. Another friend went on a mental trip flying through the world till he landed in a house in India. Both are interesting stories, but I must add during this time both of them were completely incapacitated. They were both lying down on the sofa, eyes closed, and couldn’t possibly walk. 

I’d say if you want to K-hole (which I figure is an amazing experience, having tripped with shrooms and acid before), be ready to let yourself go completely. Don’t try and retain control of consciousness, go with the flow and see where your mind takes you; you’ll enjoy it more. Safe K-holing my guy

Edit: K is also not like Coke. A much smaller amount of K will affect you compared to cocaine. If it’s your first time start out small, because if you do too much, you’ll come up within 5 mins top and itl overwhelm you and make you scared, leading to a bad k-hole"
