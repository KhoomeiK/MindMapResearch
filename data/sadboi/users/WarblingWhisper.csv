I never had a problem with a sore throat with it, but maybe heartburn a little? I can’t remember. The Iced flavours are really neat but they can lead to heartburn, too, if you tend to chain vape."

So far I have tried: Iced Blood Orange (okay), Strawberry Pink Lemonade (my fave), TVC (awesome), Strawberry Ice Cream (amazing), Iced Strawberry Watermelon (really nice), Iced Blueberry (went through this one the fastest for some reason lol)... Might be some I’m forgetting? 

Ultimately, I want to try pretty much every flavour because each flavour surprises me in relation to the incredible price."

It usually works well, but with the lockdown it feels like the world is spiralling out of control and eventually I’ll be abandoned to my own devices... which nobody can really argue with. The world is in chaos and in isolation I am mostly abandoned, even by the gov’t agency that’s supposed to help me. My parents are aiding me but it feels horrible for that to be the case.

No one will understand (unless it has happened to them). It is such a feeling of violation. Honestly, it kind of feels like a rape or molestation because it is so invasive and encompasses so much.

It does get better. Trust me. Make your passwords really strong. Don’t use the same username for everything.... i know it feels stupid, but tape your cameras. Keep changing your passwords periodically. Make it routine.

You can get through this. Don’t give up.

So many people do a hurried scroll on a ripped piece of unlined paper... I know that’s a small thing, but it shows you take care and plan things. You don’t rush. It feels like you know what you want and who you are, which is refreshing.

About your mom: it may take some time for her to accept she is not getting grandchildren out of you (at least not biological ones). Yes, I understand it is hard enough for you going through this. But she put that label on you since prob even before you were born. She came to expect certain things. It takes time and adjustment to accept people changing from what you thought they were.

She may need education on what it feels like to be a trans person. Hopefully you can help her understand. If not, you may have to distance yourself from her, hopefully just for a little while and not forever.

All the best to you! Stay safe!

Paranoia,fnb2jzk,t3_g0chf8,1586808092.0,"Can you try to tell us? It really helps to get it out and have someone else’s opinion on it. Feeling alone with terrifying thoughts is the worst and can even be dangerous... I went a really long time before telling anyone my delusions and it only hurt me more and took longer to recover. However, I do regret telling some ppl in my desperation to have comfort, so it is best to tell someone anonymous or that you fully trust instead of getting desperate and clinging to anyone that will listen.

Like another user said, having paranoia is like having a trauma. Yes, nothing may actually be “happening” in “reality,” but your brain still treats it as such. I tried explaining this to a shrink once and they blew me off. But those that have been through it understand this.

If you’re worried about someone seeing things you want to say, get a vpn. Keep a strong password on your phone. When you’re done telling us and receiving a good response, if you still feel paranoid you can delete your reddit account and start over. These are all good practices in this day and age anyway, down to periodically deleting your reddit account (we share a lot of personal info due to being anonymous and it can be used nefariously).
