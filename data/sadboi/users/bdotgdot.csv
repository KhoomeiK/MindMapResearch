I work with a number of folks who were ‚Äúonly‚Äù teachers before becoming consultants, and I‚Äôd actually think your state experience as an analyst gives you extra points on your application. Since you currently have a job with the state, you can be somewhat selective about which divisions you apply for: curriculum, special ed, early learning, etc. Consultants can do any number of things so start reviewing posts and get an idea of what you‚Äôd like to do.

I did find this on the Dept of Labor website, linked from CalHR‚Äôs official announcement of the Act:

‚ÄúIf your employer permits teleworking‚Äîfor example, allows you to perform certain tasks or work a certain number of hours from home or at a location other than your normal workplace‚Äîand you are unable to perform those tasks or work the required hours because of one of the qualifying reasons for paid sick leave, then you are entitled to take paid sick leave. 

Similarly, if you are unable to perform those teleworking tasks or work the required teleworking hours because you need to care for your child whose school or place of care is closed, or child care provider is unavailable, because of COVID-19 related reasons, then you are entitled to take expanded family and medical leave. Of course, to the extent you are able to telework while caring for your child, paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave is not available.‚Äù
