It is basically a sequel to BF2142 which is my favorite Battlefield game so far.

thedivision,fotzmhv,t1_fotqi77,1588071732.0,"It makes sense once you understand you are not playing a somewhat realistic tactical shooter but an action rpg. 

I wish Division was in the style of Escape from Tarkov. First Person for immersion and a realistic perspective (tbh third person could be explained by a camera drone following the avatar) and realistic weapon damage and impact on hit. I would play EfT if it had a pure PvE mode but it would still be missing the cool gadgets which are not realistic but authentic to the setting of The Division a setting which i really enjoy. 

So all in all my dream of Division 3 would be first person (maybe through a drone that you can launch you get third person view for a while until it's battery is empty or it's shot down), realistic or at least authentic weapon damage (a heavily armored minigun dude should take more damage than a hyena boss wearing a tshirt and baggy pants), the weapon modding/building from EfT which is just amazing and manual jumping and crouching please this coverbased movement looks cool but is very clunky and last but not least leaning.

I don't think there is anything wrong with you. Some people are just different than the norm.

That is actually a good thing because the abnormal ones usually have a different way of solving problems and more often than not are more intelligent. That can cause loneliness.

I have some pretty intelligent and educated people in my family (professors, doctors, etc.) and they suffer from loneliness too. One found someone a few years ago who is an equal and they married each other so it can work but it's rare."

I often read on this sub that people around the age of 15 +-5 want to leave this world behind. I can understand that but they haven't given themself a chance. They are so very young, too young to be leaving already IMHO.

I wanted to leave this world when i was younger too (20 years ago when i was 16) but didn't do it because i couldn't leave my mother alone with my stepdad who was a bastard back then (maybe 10 years ago he changed into a somewhat acceptable human being) he never hit her as far as i know but terrorized her mentally.

When i was ~25 years of age the world somehow seemed different than before and i didn't hate my body anymore. I started working out, not too much to ruin my joints or something but enough to get some muscles which in turn made me stronger than most people which also made me less afraid of the outside world. I never had a girlfriend but i accepted that i will be alone for the foreseeable future plus this way i have lots of time for my hobbies.
