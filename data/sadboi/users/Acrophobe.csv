WhitePeopleTwitter,fqkade6,t1_fqfvrqn,1589423244.0,"I'm pretty sure I had COVID-19 in late February, because I thought I was going to die from not being able to breathe. I also have asthma, but this was a weird feeling because even with my rescue inhaler it'd still feel like I was suffocating. For the first 3-5 days I was too scared to sleep, if I did, it'd be maybe an hour or two. Because I felt like I'd suffocate even with my sleep apnea machine. It was pure hell. I had a fever similar to yours too, it lasted the entire duration of being sick. The feeling of getting better only to have the fever come back full blast in the night. Sometimes it felt like it was frying my brain, the fever was so bad and not being able to breathe, just felt like pure hell. I originally thought it was just a really bad flu, but it was really bad. If it wasn't COVID-19, I'm really scared for it even more so.    

My husband also got sick, but his symptoms seemed less severe, but he did get shingles after because his immune system was overloaded and he's only 34. He said his lungs felt like they had glass shards in them, yet somehow he could breathe better than me.    

I seriously hope it is something we can get an immunity to, because it scares me to think of if my lungs could handle that again. My husband is still coughing from it, even though he had it back in February, I'm pretty sure it damaged his lungs."
ptsd,fqcona6,t3_ghsqmu,1589264032.0,"I'm going to be honest with you. C-PTSD or even just PTSD, isn't something you can treat as something that heals or goes away. Sometimes the harder you try to get better, the worse it gets, and it still doesn't heal or get easier. I honestly wish instead of feeding me false hope and thinking I could just try really hard to get better and one day be a functional human being, I wish people admitted that there was a good chance I might not. And more than that, instead of pushing me to get better, if they just tried to support me instead, I would probably be in a better state than I am now. After years of therapy, tons of medication, finding a supportive husband, etc, I'm still not any closer to being better or healed. That said, there are ways to decrease triggers, or ways to calm, cope, etc. 

A lot of it is knowing the triggers, and having open non-judgemental communication. The start of the relationship is the hardest, because you deal with earning trust by proving you are not like the other people. Best way to do that is be consistent and don't pressure them, it may be an annoying process that never really ends. But I do mostly trust my husband, I just don't understand why he wants to be with me or loves me, and think he probably will fall out of love or he just pities me.   

Yes, we've been together a long time, and I do love him. Just all my previous experiences in life showed me that I wasn't good enough and that people will abandon or hurt me. My trauma is very deeply engrained in my mind. Like I was formed by it, molded by it... I'm not intentionally quoting Bane from Batman, I swear. To put it in computer terms, at this point the trauma is now a virus that has embedded itself into my Operating System and trying to remove it will cause negative effects on the system i.e. loss of function or death, so far there's nothing that has been able to separate the virus from my coding. All I can do is try to not open my browser and be plagued by unwanted pop-ups and errors. Until an actual cure for it is discovered, one that works for every patient, it's not likely that I'm going to get better. Does that mean I stop trying new ways to get better, or give up and let it kill me? No. I still try my best, I don't know if I will ever get ""better"" but I do know my husband won't abandon me for some reason. So as long as he's there, I am going to keep trying my best, and be as good to him as I can be.  

I know that might sound sad or tragic, that I don't have some magical advice. But it's true and from the heart, because I honestly feel bad that my husband goes through what he does by being with me. I've tried to get rid of him, because I feel bad about him having to be with me. Because I honestly want him to be happy, even if his  happiness means me not being in his life.    

I don't know your girlfriend or her trauma personally, or how deep it runs in her, or what her personality is like. But these are all important factors you should weigh when deciding whether or not you want to go on this really hard journey with her. You also should realize it's better to leave her early in the relationship, than to create another trauma by trying to make her better, and her not getting better and then leaving her. Know that this is a big commitment, you should be sure you want to go through with it even if she doesn't ""get better."" Because you will have some really bad times, sure there will also be good times, but those bad times are really bad.  

If you do decide to stick it out, communicate well, make sure there's no misunderstandings because a lot of the initial problems in the relationship will be misunderstandings based on her trauma and maybe things you don't realize trigger her, hell she might not even know all her triggers. So it will be hard for her too. My husband and I have open conversations, and I know I've said some hurtful things that to me made perfect sense, like offering to get a divorce and go to the mental health hospital so he could be happy without me. Which made him upset, but to me, I just don't see how he can be happy with someone as broken as me. Honestly I feel like I've committed a horrible act by having a relationship with him, because I thought I could get better and I haven't. I thought with time, therapy, and medication, I could be better. Now, I've come to the realization it's not happening, and this is my life. So I need to make the best of what I have now and stop trying to change what can't be changed. 

I don't know if this is helpful. I hope it is. I do genuinely love my husband, he's a wonderful man, he deserves so much better than me."

CPTSDmemes,fnk76rw,t1_fnjtohr,1587017038.0,"Thank you for taking the time to respond, it means a lot.   

I do remember that the injuries had to at least be 3 years old by the time of the CT scan, it was with contrast if that matters. I'm not sure if they did any other tests though, they might have done an MRI but I don't know for sure since a lot of that time period is particularly foggy.    

But thanks to writing this out, I did remember there was another accidental head trauma that happened after seeing the neurologist, that was particularly bad and I didn't see a doctor, even though I definitely should have. So I feel a bit more confident that it might be worth looking into, considering psychiatric medication and therapy haven't been giving me improvement. This gives me some hope that maybe there's an explanation somewhere as to why I don't seem to be getting better. And that would at be worth it.   

Thanks again. I hope you stay safe and healthy during these rough times."

My sister used to violently shake me back and forth when I was a child, besides the psychological trauma of my past, I have begun to wonder how likely there could be have been a physical brain trauma/injury. I did see a neurologist once 12 years ago about daily migraines, they didn't mention anything about damage. And from what I know the migraines were from allergies, but I have a lot wrong psychologically. My husband mentioned I met a lot of symptoms of a TBI, but I don't know if I would just be wasting my time and the doctor's time if something wasn't noticed 12 years ago. If it matters, I have C-PTSD, ADHD, BPD, Persistent Depressive Disorder, and fear of people. So needless to say even getting the nerve to go to the doctor is hard (I am seeing a psychiatrist), I'm just not sure if I should seek help from a neurologist.   

Thanks in advance if you did end up reading this, I really appreciate any input you may have, I have been wrestling with the idea for months now. Sorry if this question bothered you at all."
ptsd,fn1r4j5,t1_fn1q5h7,1586568172.0,"It's not for their own laughter though, it's because society avoids serious conversations about abuse. That's why ""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" made a lot of really triggering jokes for me, but I understand that those jokes bring about awareness about cults and abuse and how society acts like after you are out of an abusive situation you are ""better."" When in reality you might be struggling even more because you can't adapt to society because you were ""broken."" I was really triggered by it, but I personally appreciate the awareness it brings about people in cult-like religions and abuse. People often act like that kind of shit doesn't really happen, but it does.    

You are welcome to believe that the writers and people are being jerks, but I think they are just doing their best to bring awareness and a sense of solidarity to people who feel alone."
ptsd,fn1pfkg,t3_fyphuu,1586567066.0,"I think it's partly because the writers are victims as well. The reason I say this is because I remember hearing about the shift in media from the ""cookie-cutter"" perfect families to the more flawed ones. I remember the writer saying something along the lines of ""I used to think I was alone, everyone else had good families and I didn't. It made me think it was my fault and it was just me. So when I grew up and found out I wasn't alone, I decided to make media that people like me could identify with."" Or something like that.    

I remember thinking that too as a kid, why were my parents abusive towards me, why wasn't I loved like those other kids? I think the messed up families made me feel less alone, less like abuse was my fault and more like abuse is a fucked up reality that exists and we need to shed light on it. Sitcoms and comedy is a way to approach horrible subjects without overwhelming people who normally would never learn about these subjects.   

Everyone copes in their own ways, I cope by making inappropriate jokes about my abusive childhood and mental health. Because if I don't laugh about it, I'm going to cry and have a full on breakdown. My husband doesn't understand my coping mechanism, but for me it's how I survived and how I continue to survive.    

That said it's perfectly okay to not be okay with that kind of humor, but I think there was a documentary on Netflix about humor and the Holocaust that explained this method of coping the best. It's called ""The Last Laugh"" I think if you want to try to understand why this kind of humor exists, it's a great way to understand people who use this method of coping. I know the Holocaust is some heavy shit, but I feel like it really explains why humor is used in this way. I always try to understand people, because growing up in a toxic environment left me lacking a lot in social skills. So I enjoy learning about how other people cope. Because my means of coping may not be right for someone else. That said, it might be too heavy for you to watch, I cried watching it, but I really felt it was worth watching.    

I'm sorry if I worded anything poorly though, none of this is meant to make anyone feel bad. Just to explain why it exists and why it's needed for some people. I mean, it's hard to talk about abuse and stuff, without humor I would just never be able to open up about stuff I went through. It may feel messed up, but my emotions are so intense I need to distract with humor. My therapist had a hard time understanding that for a while. I think partly because of that she never understood just how broken I was, but it was just easier to deal with everything this way for me."

I think you should watch something with him that has something similar in it and see what his reaction is. While letting him know you think it's sweet and endearing. I don't know of any movies off the top of my head like that, but this is Reddit and the internet. I'm sure someone can recommend a non-graphic sweet movie about a guy secretly into his roommate or something.

She had a selfish personality, unlike Artoria who would give up all her wants for the country, Morgan was selfish and didn't realize why she was unfit to rule.    

Essentially Morgan's greed for the crown was part of the reason she was unfit to rule. She wanted power that she thought she was entitled to. Artoria didn't really want it, she just wanted what was best for the country. So, I'd argue that Morgan would not have been a good Queen because she was more obsessed with the power rather than the good of the country. 

That said, their father should have not been so set on a ""male"" ruler, if she had been trained since the beginning maybe she could have been a great Queen and then Artoria wouldn't have had to crossdress and pretend to be a guy too. Honestly it's really tragic. :("

I love how much love they put into their characters, personality, quirks, story, interactions, chemistry with other characters.

Even annoying characters like Elizabeth grow on you and make you want to protect them.

I haven't found trading options or tried groups yet, but I'm sure those probably exist as well. Part of the reason buying sealed sets is my favorite option is if something were to happen to a figure I always have a spare to either resell or trade for a replacement. If you get a membership with some sites you can get reduced shipping, etc, others just offer a discount on new releases. I personally use Tokyo Otaku Mode and have a premium membership. They give you loyalty points and often I put the points to my next purchase. Of course, that's only if you plan on buying a lot of figures. Other sites have other great options too. A lot of ebay stuff is overpriced. Whereas if you buy the set, let's say $90 for 6 figures that's $15 a figure, then from there if you use a site that rewards you for loyalty or other things you can get the price lower. And a lot of people have waifus that you might not have. Of course if it's a matter of not wanting to go through the trouble. You can look for local anime/comic shops, some might finally be carrying Fate figures and you might find that they have people willing to trade.

BorderlinePDisorder,ewzma8o,t3_cqn2vr,1565897678.0,"It depends on the company and your employee contract, but if they are planning on firing you or something because of your disability then that's considered discrimination. As long as you were/are able to perform your job with reasonable accommodation they have no right to fire you.   

 Reasonable accommodation is determined by how much they would lose, they can't hire someone to do your work for you, but they can be required to accommodate your disability as long as you spend a certain amount of time working and do your job. If you are being told otherwise, find a lawyer who specializes in disability discrimination. People have been forced to add ramps and other things to accommodate people, as long as it's nothing too expensive for your company they are legally required to not discriminate. That said they often will try to create a false reason to fire you, so if you have any proof of discrimination or being fired because of your mental illness you can sue. So keep records.    


I looked into this because I have been unable to work because of my PTSD and phobia of people, my BPD doesn't help, but really it's the panic and flashbacks that trigger my BPD. I realized that a lot of those ""questionaires"" they make potential employees fill out are psychiatric discrimination, they don't hire people who have disorders they weed them out, so a lot of us have to lie to get a job. Not much we can do about it though, since the government hasn't really done anything about it. But, my point is, you aren't alone.

Of course if you don't live in the USA I don't know if you have similar laws wherever you may live. So you might want to look it up. You aren't to blame for having mental health problems.

Not that I'm against busty figures, it's just that most of Nami's seem to lose her personality in exchange for more fan service points."

grandorder,epcl1zg,t1_epcfv2z,1559155431.0,"Preference doesn't mean if you find someone who has everything else you love in a partner, you are going to dislike or refuse them. Everyone has preferences, but that shouldn't make or break a relationship.    

For example: I've always had a preference for guys with dark hair and eyes. My husband has neither of those things, but I still love his light hair and eyes because it's part of him. Same goes with any other part of him.     

As for women not preferring tiny dicks, that's not true. It exists. It may not be as well known or celebrated as much as small chests, but it exists. And there's a lot of reasons why someone might prefer a tiny dick, women come in all shapes and sizes, even down there. And there's a lot of psychological reasons why someone would prefer a tiny dick too. As internet rule 34 states: If it exists there is porn of it. If you really don't believe me, you can Google it."

I married my husband because he's an amazing person, who I love being with and embrace even his flaws. He loves me despite my flaws too. People forget that real love isn't that shallow, it's truly loving your partner and accepting everything about them, even their flaws. Not trying to change them, just wanting to be with them as long as possible. Helping each other do what is best for each other, not making them lose their identity or forcing them to change. I describe it as ""two warriors fighting back to back, covering each other's weaknesses, celebrating the successes and mourning the losses together."" It's an awesome thing, I know that I probably sound weird describing it like that.     

So, try to remember, your size doesn't matter. It's who you are inside that truly matters."
