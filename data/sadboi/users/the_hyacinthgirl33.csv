opiates,f2zc648,t1_f2v9b4t,1570514286.0,I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're getting but they way you've described that symptom reminds me of how it'd make me feel. I'd feel like one arm was like the size of a truck and then the other would feel like a pencil or something lol. I looked it up for opioids and it said all different psychoactive drugs can make it happen. Do you get migraines ever?
opiates,f2uqqeo,t3_deb3u6,1570425059.0,"The feeling you're talking about with your limbs sounds like something called ""Alice in Wonderland Syndrome"". I've had it from topamax but not from opiates."

modafinil,eztp96y,t3_d27h5b,1568135560.0,"I prefer armodafinil for sure, but my friend prefers Moda. With armodafinil i didn't get headaches and felt happier so it helped my focus. It did the opposite for her which surprised me. I think a lot of it has to do with how you personally process it but I've heard armodafinil is a bit more intense."
fuckeatingdisorders,ezaxjbp,t3_d0b9ai,1567809236.0,"I developed an eating disorder at your age, and as it progressed I got progressively worse at track. I was always malnourished and by my senior year I had to quit it entirely and cross country as well. Because I was so incredibly unhealthy I couldn't even run. You don't need to lose weight to be a good athlete. Your body NEEDS the carbs and energy. Maybe you won't lose a bunch of weight but it's because you're building muscle! Please take care of yourself ðŸ’•"

TooAfraidToAsk,eoghez5,t3_brqtjz,1558558000.0,"You might be looking for thr point subconsciously. I do this as well, but I actually majored in literature and am a law student now which are both reading-heavy. I always pay little attention because I'm searching for the point of things first and then going back but it isn't efficient obviously.
What I do/ you could try is by searching for main ideas first and then doing a thorough read with that knowledge in hand. It's at least how i read cases now and I find it super helpful. Good luck to you! You're no less intelligent, your brain is just trying to cut back time wasting haha."
