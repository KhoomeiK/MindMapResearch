SuicideWatch,fclixb9,t3_e5tfi6,1577748861.0,I have anxiety so I can't help but worry about a future. But at the same time I can't see a future for myself beyond a handful of years. Like most people I know can imagine their lives after college or getting married. I just have the feeling that I won't live that much longer. If I try to imagine my future I just can't or it's just darkness. It's been like this for a couple of years now.
