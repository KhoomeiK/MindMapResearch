What I learned on here is that it's never too late to build yourself up. Employers dont look at your age, they look at what you can do. Being computer literate is great. I say try to get a job in maybe data entry. I'm not computer proficient and was about to be hired to do data entry so I think you'll be good. It wont make you 30k initially but you'll have a job and you can work on something to the side. Maybe study on your own to be IT certified. Maybe you can learn to build websites and move your way up in the company because web designers are in high demand. College might seem impossible but what I learned is that it's not. It'll just take some time but it's a great payoff. It does open up doors. My friend has a job right now completely unrelated to his degree. The job makes 20 an hour and it's so simple that people like us can definitely do it, but he got hired over others simply because he has a degree. These are my suggestions. Good luck to you."

WWE,fcbrw0s,t3_eh0sl0,1577590283.0,"To each their own. I can see why you dont like the fiend. But I really do and my reason is they're letting bray do his thing. I really think this idea and all the promos are almost 100 percent his. That level of creative freedom is almost nonexistent in current wwe. Also, bray was too good of a talent to not have reached to the top, and most people love it because he finally got to the top. The unbeatable element of the fiend has to change eventually and I hope they do it carefully instead of him just become weaker and weaker such as other monsters like kane."

stunfisk,fc9455k,t3_ee2yzr,1577546736.0,"I need help finding a win condition when I'm playing ranked.

I'm new to competitive play. I'm playing singles ranked right now. I've finally learned the iv/ev stuff. I've trained two competitive dragapults, one with infiltrator and the other with clear body, both are attackers with no support moves like screens, both have choice items. One is jolly and the other is adamant. I've also trained a tank corsola with eviolite, stealth rock set up with strength sap with will o wisp and night shade. I have an excadrill with focus sash, and jolly nature. The last pokemon I have for competitive is mimikyu with life orb, swords dance set up to boost my attack. 

I've spent a lot of time breeding and ev training so my rank is still beginner but I'm having trouble winning most of my battles. I dont know how to setup properly or counter. For example, I will lose badly to stat boosters like gastrodon or recover Milotic. They'll spam and setup and then switch over to their hitters and eventually wipe out my team. I need help to figure out a win condition instead of having random hitters and tanks. Just some strategies to help me find some consistency when I play ranks. Thank you in advance."

WWE,fbswy0j,t3_eecj46,1577062403.0,I actually like current face miz. I'm invested in the fact that he wants to protect his family from wyatt and it's a nice story of how he was once selfish and now he has something real to fight for.

PokemonSwordAndShield,fbilufw,t1_fbilper,1576905026.0,I've been trying different builds. I turn auto save off so I've been starting over just because my stats dont match showdown. I changed my dreepy to jolly and did the same ev spread but the stats didn't match either so I started over. I just want to figure this out and see what I'm doing wrong.
