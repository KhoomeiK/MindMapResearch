Anxiety,fg26yy4,t1_fg25me2,1580439693.0,"Good point! Its hard to get into the practice of being more assertive, I often feel like I have to be overly friendly and timid because I’m getting in these peoples way and they really are doing me a favor. My therapist recommended this assertiveness training book called When I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel Smith. Maybe you’d like it too!"
Adoption,fg06ccq,t3_evvz0g,1580401182.0,"Hi! Fellow transracial adoptee here (: I was the same as you (and kinda still am) in that I never had an interest in meeting my biological family as a kid. I also didn't care to learn about my birth culture or the country.  I distanced myself from other asian kids because didn't share those same cultural ties, and I didn't want to be lumped in and I wanted to fit in with the larger majority as much as possible. 

As I got older, while in college I started taking an interest in learning more about korean language and culture. I love my adoptive family, but I've also experienced microaggressions, dismissiveness and racism at the hands of my white family, and for me its become important to try and connect with my roots. I don't have longing to meet my birth parents, I would be satisfied with seeing a picture, they are essentially strangers to me. If it happens along the way though I wouldn't mind. I'm pretty sure I would feel out of place with my birth family, and I sometimes feel out of place with my adoptive family. Not all of the time, but there are moments where I'm reminded that I'm different and it amazes me how comfortable some family members are with saying racist things almost as if they forget I'm in the room or as if they see me as white."

JUSTNOMIL,f23u5kl,t3_db7dii,1569937699.0,"Some of these things affect me, some don't but they don't make me more inclined to want to associate with the lady. 

1. Perhaps the first 'off' thing after her overly friendly introduction to me was her deciding to have a long string of text conversations with me in which she proceeded to ask me what I went to school for, insult my entire profession because of a bad experience she had and then go on to say ""as an adult if I could just tell them they're all useless I would!"" Didn't know how to reply to this, coming from my boyfriend's mom whom I've just met other than saying I'm sorry that happened to you. 
2. Her trying to get me to admit that I don't like my boyfriend's beard (because she doesn't) and then when I don't agree with her she says the only reason I'm saying that is because I don't want other women to look at him and it's her job to tell him when he looks bad. 
3. I'm in a semi-long distance relationship, a little over 2 hours away, my boyfriend LIVES at home currently. Yet, she still feels the need to call him almost every time we're together. She claims he should always answer when she calls unless he's at work or in the movies..... he fought back on this and she exploded. Her reasoning isn't just to make sure he's arrived to his destination because she also called everyday when we were on vacation together. 
4. She blocked contact with her own daughter (SO eldest sister) because she didn't reply to her messages on instagram while she temporarily deactivated her account. 
5. She made a comment to her youngest daughter's friend who was wearing makeup, ""why do you wear makeup? You know that probably means you're insecure""
6. Some of this may not be able to be helped, and I don't know the details like my boyfriend does. But his mom doesn't drive, or work. She's only in her 40s and isn't on disability or anything, this means that somebody else has to take her places and if its not her husband, its her son since nobody else in the house drives. Just a mild inconvenience. 

UGH, just little things over here. But I wanted to rant lol"
JUSTNOMIL,f1mipkg,t1_f1lxk8v,1569594841.0,"I don't think he meant it by I just have to sit there and tolerate it, I'll ask clarification on this though. I think he was mostly referring to his sisters because hes closest with them so tolerate them enough to see them every now and then. He didn't really include his parents in that statement, and his sisters are both fine, oldest lives out of state. The only thing is right now his youngest sister still lives with his mom haha"
personalfinance,ew1xgmf,t1_ew1uqci,1565033618.0,"That's a good point, I'll bring that up. I spoke with my mom this morning and she's fine with having the company cover the education costs but I will talk with her about this as well. I have an accountant I should probably run this by her too."
personalfinance,ew165ui,t1_ew15jv5,1565016100.0,"Yeah it sounds pretty dumb, I'd be working under my moms company and she's been doing this for a while and has emphasized the importance of deductions and when I brought up the cost and whether or not the company would be paying for my education if I agree to take the job she brought up the fact that I wouldn't be able to claim it on my taxes. So that is why I was asking, but I supposed she of course would rather I pay for it myself than the company pay which is why she mentioned it."
personalfinance,ew14qyx,t1_ew13ugd,1565015117.0,"Oh, no! The courses cost about that much, it wouldn't affect my income. It would just be another thing I could claim on my taxes sorry for any confusion"

Adoption,et0ddxu,t1_esvfkgv,1562377048.0,"Same! My mom thinks that being colorblind is a positive thing or another way of saying ""im accepting of all and not racist"". Its hard to explain to her that that colorblind attitude in itself is a little racist, and also comes from a place of privilege. The world isnt colorblind, and POC see the effects of this in their daily lives, so ignoring it is also ignoring the racism that still goes on in society today. Plus, theres nothing wrong with acknowledging that we're different, we look different and its NOT a bad thing. It doesn't have to be ignored! 

I also got a lot of those sort of comments from other asian people growing up, and I think it made me sort of distance myself as a kid because I felt like I couldnt relate. There also was some ignorance and self hate on my part in that I didnt want to be lumped in with all the other asian kids"
Adoption,esr1qgt,t1_esqyw3k,1562214560.0,"Thank you for sharing! That's interesting, and it makes me sad hearing that your husband has to struggle with that. I am also asian american!

Now I embrace both, and I've had to teach myself about korean culture. I wish the same for your husband! Hopefully he is able to rid some of that self hate. Its okay (: we may not feel like we fit perfectly into one box or the other but the outside doesnt have to match the inside.

Anxiety,eqo0va7,t3_byxbo9,1560182681.0,"I relate to your post so much, and it can be easy to feel that way when you are surrounded by people who don't understand so they may not see why you are anxious and expect you to shrug it off. Anxiety is a normal feeling that we all experience, but those of us with an anxiety disorder experience it to a higher degree and in situations that are safe but for whatever reason our body deems it harmful. Its a disorder for a reason, and we didnt ask for it. Showing symptoms of a disorder isn't childish, but I think with anxiety or depression it can come off that way to ignorant people who don't get it. Its a battle, dont be too hard on yourself (: 

I struggle with work anxiety and driving anxiety which has held me back and makes me feel like I am several steps behind my peers, why can't i just do these everyday things and not cry about it like others in my age group. It makes me feel ridiculous, but I have to remember that this is something I am working on. Yeah, I have to push myself, and sometimes I break down, cry, panic over things that come easy to other people but its not easy for me, I'm trying, and we should reward ourselves for the effort! Baby steps."
Anxiety,eq8q2c5,t1_eq8phg1,1559872149.0,"Wow thats horrible, I'm sorry that happened to you! That sounds traumatizing. Luckily, my anxiety hasn't gotten to the point of a panic attack. For me its mostly racing heart beart, chest tightness and sometimes an upset stomach before I have to go somewhere. It's similar to the anxiety I get before maybe a job interview, presentation etc. Lots of anticipation anxiety days before I know I have to drive, and then the symptoms I described."
Anxiety,eq7vmcp,t1_eq7rs9f,1559854009.0,"Nope, no accidents or anything. Learning to drive was stressful for me because my mom was trying to teach me and she would yell a lot but I think I was already anxious to begin with. I never had the urge to drive as a teenager. 

This might be weird, and I do worry about getting into an accident and hurting others or myself but my anxiety doesn't stem from ""if I get into a car I could die or kill someone"", I get anxious because I worry about making mistakes and having people honk at me, accidentally cutting someone off, getting pulled over, getting into a minor accident and not knowing what to do/having the other driver yell at me or think I'm an idiot etc. So aside from the major stuff, I get more anxious about the little things."

JUSTNOMIL,ep855x2,t1_ep7x6lm,1559090440.0,"I have yet to have a conversation about extremes with him, but I think he would be okay with it. He has already said he thought about blocking his moms number in my phone and finding a way to delete my number out of hers. I would be totally cool with this, but I'll let him take the initiative on that and then I'll follow, because I won't dare block his mom with her still having my number or she'll rage. I'm just trying to be as polite as I can and give her no reason to shit talk me, and if he wants to take it that far I'll support it the NC."
JUSTNOMIL,ep7ghw7,t1_ep78687,1559081515.0,"Thats great that your husband established that early on, and that you guys decided to move on the other side of the country! haha! 

Its really tough, I'm trying to be mindful of his feelings as well and I would never want to make him feel put in the middle. However, I also don't really want to be involved with his family. I think its the level of closeness that bothers me, loving your family is awesome but if I choose to be with him long term then I will inevitably also have to be around them. Even if he says I have no obligation or expectation to be, it makes things more difficult if I decide not to be since he is very close with them. If he loved his family the same, but was less involved it would be golden."
JUSTNOMIL,ep75v96,t1_ep6vm0q,1559077705.0,"Part of that is on me, I sat with it for a few months due to the fact that he was so close with his mom (and I didn't know if he was a ""mamas boy"") I was afraid to say anything because she wasn't being outright abusive just taking many digs at me. I didn't know how to bring it up because that was his mom I surely thought he would take her side. 

But when I did bring it up, he said his moms behavior was embarrassing and that he wished I would have told him sooner and if something like that happens again then to let him know so that he can address it on the spot as it happens, he apologized on her behalf. He wants to bring it up now but I told him its fine, I don't want any drama. If something happens from here on out I will let him know but that was a while ago so its fine. 

It was making me uncomfortable because she would text me a lot and want to carry on these long conversations and thats just not my style, I think its good to have numbers in case of emergencies or to check in and make sure he's okay but I just dont want to be buddy buddy with her, not at this point. I just dont think its necessary. Plus, she would call him every time we were together for mundane things, I asked him if he could call her on his way home or shoot her a text instead (unless its something urgent in which case of course its no big deal I just got tired of her always calling while we were spending time together.) She got explosively angry when he opted to text her instead of talking on the phone said that shes his mother and he should always answer unless hes at work or at the movies where he cant answer. She texted his close female friend and said that she thinks im the reason why he isnt answering her calls and that she and his stepdad are planning on talking with him about it as soon as he gets home.  I asked him if he always answers when he is with other people and he said no he texts her then as well. He was furious and said that his family always does this, and if they are going to keep acting like this then he'll just leave again. 

Oddly enough his mom didnt bring it up once he was home. He took some time to cool off and then had a conversation with her later about not involving his friends in his personal issues, taking it up with him instead, and keeping my name out of her mouth because anything he does is because he is choosing to do it. 

He has said many times that he doesn't want her texting his friends or his girlfriend and she tells him that he is the only one who thinks its weird and shes going to continue to do it anyways. 

He's been able to set boundaries I just hope that he enforces them when she isn't willing to respect them."
JUSTNOMIL,ep6o2lr,t1_ep6m25v,1559071498.0,"Yes! I'm so relieved, I was scared to tell him about some of the things his mother was saying to me and that I was uncomfortable with her constantly texting me etc. You're right, no relationship is perfect and he can't control what his mother does, only how he chooses to respond to her. Same for me, I can only be polite and respectful everything else is out of my hands."
JUSTNOMIL,ep6lfjp,t1_ep6igkr,1559070533.0,"Me too haha she does what she does, as long as its outside of the bubble of our relationship and she doesn't tell our business to this friend anymore, I'm cool."
JUSTNOMIL,ep6dc1j,t1_ep6b8b6,1559067587.0,"No I don't believe so, we all went to the same high school and graduated same year. He used to have a crush on her but they are strictly friends, she has a boyfriend and never expressed any returned interest. He says that his mom began talking with her about a similar interest/hobby and they have talked ever since. They would still text each other even when he didn't talk to his family. His mom also has a habit of going to this friend with problems she is having with him when he is not doing what she wants him to do. God its freaking weird, I don't understand why a grown woman would want to be best friends with her sons friend who is half her age."
JUSTNOMIL,ep67yje,t1_ep65tqz,1559065725.0,"I can see what you're saying, I guess that is the question that I am still thinking about. Being close to your family is great, I just think that at some point there needs to be more independence since he isnt going to be there forever, they got by just fine when he moved out before. I don't expect anyone to change on my behalf if its not something they dont want to do. Ive told him many times that I dont want him setting boundaries because its something I want or for my sake, it has to be something we're both on board with and he agrees. If it wasn't something he also wanted or thought needed to happen, then I would rather know that now so that neither of our time is wasted.  I'm not trying to change a routine that someone is comfortable or happy with themselves, that may just mean we are incompatible which happens."
JUSTNOMIL,ep65mlh,t1_ep63g0a,1559064942.0,"Thats tough, that always confuses me when a mom is jealous and doesnt want her adult child to have a healthy relationship. Its a little bizarre. Parents should want their child to grow up and become more independent, it shouldn't be threatening. 

You're right though, and I refuse to cave or sacrifice healthy boundaries to console my boyfriends moms anxieties. She is friends with one of his female friends (they text all the time) and while I'm sure she would love if her son dated that friend or a woman who will go along with her antics, I'm not her. (and to be real, I don't even think that friend would be happy with his moms behavior if she was in my position )"
JUSTNOMIL,ep64g88,t1_ep627k7,1559064510.0,"They have already made me out to be a scapegoat claiming that he ""acts different when he gets a girlfriend"".  I know that as long as he supports me I can't concern myself with how his family feels about me whether they voice it or not.  We are both searching for new jobs and hope to move in together possibly next year. He says that he can only prove to me with actions, that the dynamic with his family will be much different when he moves out and he's doing everything he can right now with his living situation to set proper boundaries. I just worry, if I plan on moving in with him, that is a large commitment and I would feel much better if we moved far away with limited contact. Although I would not vocalize this to him or expect this.  My main concern is that he does everything for his mother since she does not work or drive (she is married, but he and his stepdad are the only two that drive, his little sister does not). Will he continue to over extend himself this much even if he moves out? Will his mom call him as often as she does now? So many questions....."
