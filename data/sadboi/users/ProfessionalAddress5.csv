so, your solution is... people shouldn't wear masks... ok...

and i thought you were going to stop responding to me?

EDIT: This conversation has been enlightening.

I could've delivered this message in a more tactful way, which probably would've helped get the message across. But, it's really not my job. And... I honestly don't really care whether you understand or not. But, it does boggle my mind. I can't believe there are people out there that think face masks do not help you. I can't believe people are saying this. It's changing my world view and opening my eyes towards human nature.

Have I been overestimating the average person's intelligence this whole time?

The logic behind wearing a mask is really quite simple.

If someone infected coughs or sneezes, virus particles gets released to the air. A face mask acts as a barrier to prevent the virus from getting into your mouth or nose which leads the virus into your respiratory tract, your lungs. And this virus attacks your lungs. It's so blindingly obvious I can't believe i have to spell it out.

Versus someone who didn't wear a mask. They would literally just breathe those particles in. It's so blindingly obvious. Next thing these people are telling me condoms, don't work to prevent pregnancy.

If you still don't understand this, the fault lies with you not me. I have presented evidence. I have painstakingly explained my argument. You really haven't made any arguments, other than ""But, X said this"". 1) X isn't always right. 2) X has a political agenda. 3) X didn't present any evidence either. What X stated is a **recommendation**, it's not **evidence**, that masks don't protect you. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. You can point at the moon, but there'll always be someone looking at your finger.

Regardless of whether I've helped anyone. I have gotten something out of this seemingly pointless interaction. Definitely has opened my eyes a bit to people. Authority bias and fear are very strong psychological forces that impede critical thinking. People believe in what they want to believe... I should know that better than anyone.

that said, still pretty shocking, pretty much all tankers lost 10-20% in 1 day, after that tweet."

We'll have to see how much oil reserves they can build.

>Before the government’s directive was made public, consultancies SIA  Energy and Wood Mackenzie Ltd. both estimated that China could probably  add 80 million to 100 million barrels to reserves this year before it  ran into logistical and operational constraints.

&#x200B;

>In December, state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. said  on its website that the government intends to boost the capacity of its  strategic petroleum reserves to 503 million barrels by the end of this  year, an indicator of the maximum amount the government can store."

SecurityAnalysis,fm4pvbm,t1_fm4mnxn,1585758617.0,"The two sort of unknowns in the thesis that I could see are:

It requires the Saudis or the oil producers to keep production for at least another 50 days to get the 1 billion barrel surplus. 

And, there's not enough places to store landfill. What if alternatives for the tankers to store oil comes up? I know this is unlikely, seeing as it's quite a short time frame, but it's another risk to be aware of."

Just realised today, buying ETFs that track the price of oil via futures is a bad idea.

Will be looking in this tanker play, although... they've already gone up by 20% or so over the past few days/week. Some have gone up 50% already. TNK etc.

Why are people recommending to buy LPG? Those guys own VLGC, they store LPGs..."
