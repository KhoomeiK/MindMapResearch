But unless we're absolutely certain, I think it's best not to assume based on how something ""sounds"" that we understand one's intentions and then proceed to shame them publicly. I bet we both agree on that.

As far as my original post, I reread it and I'd say it again. I identify with the OP's sentiments and merely reflected them back in my own words. If you look around this sub you'll find that happens a lot here. It would be tiring to go around scolding everyone who says wrongthink. I feel this way man, and now OP knows there's another person going through the same shit as him. Shared experiences are important, even when they suck.

I would have appreciated you sharing your own positive, uplifting story, but not the tongue-lashing. There's a few of those people skulking about - I've run into them before. No one really likes them because no one wants to be pulled out in front of class and paddled like a child by the self-appointed hall monitors.

I also don't see where I ""tried to bring others down with me"". I merely expressed how I honestly feel. 

The ""psychic razor blade"" analogy is clever, though.

Honesty is the most important thing in depression. I know the virtue points must be enticing in a place like this, but trying to morally shame someone who just shared their truth is definitely the wrong tactic on this forum because it invalidates their lived experience. 

You also maliciously smeared my intentions, telling the whole world that my goal was to ""shit on"" and ""bring others down"". What if I was inarticulate? Or English was not my native language? Or too young to put together the right sentence? Or you simply misunderstood my words. Your harsh condemnation might have pushed me off one of the best platforms for discussing my condition. Or worse. That's a horrible thing to do to someone you don't even know.

Strong Suggestion: Reread posts you don't agree with and try to understand the poster's REAL feelings first before trying to virtue signal and protect the feelings of IMAGINARY readers who will never see this post.

Social media and hero-worship videos of *awesome people* doing *awesome things* are anathema to me and I avoid people who extol others or talk about people who will never talk about them (ie, celebrities, etc). It keeps me focused on what I have rather than what I don't.

depression,fqvvciq,t3_gl1gne,1589686022.0,"Yes! And I use that exact same phrase to describe what I'm doing. I've been depressed pretty much my whole life, but no one knew because I hide it by smiling, acting in control, and generally being an optimist.

The one tool I've always had against my depression, though, was this idea that it means something. I've used treatment and medication, but we all know that, while it may contain the gloom and thoughts of self-harm, it suffocates some essential part of us. That is the part of me that is interested in ""connecting the dots"".

Two times in my life I went balls-in to figure out what this is and why I feel it. The first time was when I was just a little younger than you, in university, staring down the standard American life. I didn't know what I truly wanted, but I knew it wasn't that. Depression was surfacing hard and fast, drugs, neglecting studies, the whole thing. Then I just started following the dots, asking questions and looking for answers. And I didn't stop, only accelerated. Then I saw something that I wanted so badly it utterly broke my life: purpose. Something greater than producing and consuming garbage.

That was it. Within a couple of months I gave everything up and bought a one way ticket to India with the intent of living an ascetic life spent contemplating this purpose. Over the course of the next few years I was able to spend my days connecting those dots and experiencing an amazing and adventurous life in the Himalayas, unworried about work because my rent was $30 per month.

Leaving America to understand my life, my depression, and ""connect the dots"" was the single most important decision I've ever made, hands down. I didn't find the answers and ended up hitting a dead end, but that glimpse of The Answer has never left me. 

The second time was just 6 months ago, around my 40th. After a decade of success building a company, I was once again utterly hopeless and depressed. But I remembered The Answer I was shown in my 20s, and reluctantly, after two years of pain and self-isolation, I renewed the search. So much wiser now, I quickly found the answers that held me back in my 20s, and I once again am on the journey to connect the dots. 

Depression, at least for me, doesn't go away. But when I listen to it and strive to understand it, I find answers that give me a reason to move forward. What I've learned about myself is that my depression rears it's head when I'm living without purpose. Every. Single. Time. And when I suppress it with pills I don't grow; I become stuck. I believe that those of us who feel this way are the seekers; we know that life is bullshit, and depression is an invitation to examine life and poke holes in the narrative. 

So yes, if you feel you are constantly trying to connect the dots, I encourage you with all my being and support, to do that. Because you clearly have something to discover and then share. Something vitally, and purposefully important. The process will hurt both you and those around you if you really listen to yourself because it will change the life you have lived. But the person who grows out of it will be the person you are meant to be.

Stay strong, and good luck."

depression,fqtkrmu,t3_gkp5b0,1589640924.0,"Man I know exactly what you're experiencing. I was the youngest of three boys, and my relatives all referred to me as ""the golden child"". I got good grades, stayed in school, didn't smoke, learned valuable skills, and went to college. I got super depressed just after high school and took a half year off, got into the rave and party scene but then ultimately dropped out of University again. I remember when I realized how disappointed my parents were, but they kept it to themselves. My relationship with my father never really recovered, and when he recently died we found some mementos he clearly treasured that spoke to his goals for me to stay in school. Even though I went on to start my own 7 figure company employing 60 people, it never seemed to recover.

I know it sucks, but you gotta be you, and that's gotta be enough. I think my depression post high school was triggered in part because of the expectations laid upon me. I didn't want them anymore, and I had to confront that. It took a few years to get through this; I basically had to kill off the person everyone wanted me to be so I could find the real me. And it was pretty fast and brutal. Right after coming out, I embraced my inner wanderer, gave everything up around 21, hitchhiked the States and Mexico, and ended up buying a one way ticket to India where I live to this day about 15 years later. It was so fast and complete no one really had time to process it. But it is the life I chose, and I'm so glad that I did.

Ill be up front, if not a bit insensitive to some people - I think depression is tied to the lives we live rather than the chemicals in our brain. If you spend all your time living the life other people want, guess what? You're going to get depressed. You are very young and you have your whole awesome life ahead of you, man. I'm not sure what the life you really want looks like, but you've shared enough that I know it's not what you're doing now. Some people will be disappointed when you choose to be your authentic self, but they will get over it and the important ones will love you as you really are. Listen closely to yourself and follow your heart on this one, not your fear of upsetting others.

I wish you the best of luck."

I don't think it ends, frankly. I think we just get better at managing it. Or we don't. I believe that we have to make that decision ourselves - are we going to make this easier on ourselves, or harder? 

There is one thing that I can offer that worked for me and I'm confident will work for pretty much everyone else: take a break. Take 6 months off and go to a different country.

What brings people together is shared purpose, and most of us, especially in the western world, live pretty pointless lives of consumerism and self-enrichment in the end. Neither of which are conducive to building meaningful human connections.

I believe those of us who are depressed have forgotten our purpose. I've found that once I realized I had a purpose, I chose to be around people who  I could connect with. Before that, it was just an endless parade of disconnected and affected acquaintances, really."

At some point you'll have to decide how to move forward; as a victim, or as a survivor. Things won't get better until you decide they will, but you do have to make that decision, one way or the other. And that decision will manifest in how you choose to describe your life. Right now, it all looks and sounds bad because you've chosen to see and explain it all that way. You could just as easily describe your life as a series of challenges you've overcome. Give it a try, and things will improve. What have you got to lose?"
depression,fqo44sl,t3_gjygs0,1589507182.0,"Hey man. I have been through this process and what I've found is the initial surge in ambitions after a change in medication can be intense, but also temporary. One of the most important skills when dealing with these chemicals is to give yourself some time and let the various cycles play out until they come into balance. What today is extreme ambition, might next week be extreme lethargy. So I would resist forming attachments to these ideas and goals until everything has settled down a bit and the real picture emerges.

Hope this helps!"
depression,fqo3dj4,t3_gjx2tq,1589506743.0,"I agree that all the ""potential"" talk is an accelerant. Because it implies that there's something wrong with us, and that, if we could just fix ourselves, we'd be able to do something important and worthwhile. And if we don't fix ourselves, we are wasting that potential.

That's BS. But it's up to you to realize that.

The first thing we need to do is imagine that depression isn't actually a disorder or illness. Imagine that depression is a very clear message from a fully functional machine. What is that message saying? It's not saying to kill ourselves, friend. 

We're all going to interpret that message differently, but one thing has become very clear to me after a lifetime of living with it and searching for answers; we're not ill. And we're not supposed to kill ourselves. It's also possible we aren't meant to achieve the ""potential"" your friends and family talk about. Those of us who are depressed are here for a different reason entirely, and to realize that we first have to accept that our depression is not an illness. Then listen to what it's trying to tell us about life."
depression,fqo2681,t1_fqnmwjm,1589506043.0,Well said.
depression,fqo0cz7,t3_gjwvt5,1589504986.0,"No. That's not moving past it. That's indulging it. Suicidal ideation is a place we can get stuck, but we're not supposed to spend too much time there. Perhaps this will help.

I feel the same way. And I'll spend entire days just dwelling on dying. I don't plan my funeral, but I do close my eyes and imagine just not being here. But then at some point I open them up again and get moving.

What I've realized is that I'm completely and utterly lost in life. Up until recently I had no clue what life is and why I'm here. I acted like I knew; I had ambitions, a successful IT company with employees, a great dog, partner, and a pretty cool life from all appearances. But in reality, it was all bullshit because I was, and am, completely lost.

Saying that out loud - ""I'm lost"" - was actually the most important thing I ever did. It meant I could stop pretending I knew what I was doing, and start actually living with some purpose. And what I realized was pretty clear: when you're lost, you only want one thing. To get home. Getting home is the only purpose for those of us who are tired of life. Not taking pills, getting treatment, and pretending that life is something it isn't.

Getting home gave me purpose. Where is home? That's up to you to decide, but to me, home is not life. Life is endless, cyclical pain and suffering. I accept that. But I also know that I won't get there by sitting down and wishing I wasn't here. Forgive me, but I see you as one of the lost, who is awake enough to know you're lost, but who has stopped along the trail home somewhere to lament your fate.

We need to trek through this barren wasteland called life until we find home. All the shiny bullshit and distractions that titillate all the other lost people who have no clue they are lost, don't pull us in because we know that it's all bullshit. Because our mission is singular: get home. Don't stop on the trail and despair. Wake up, get back on your feet, and keep moving. We know things that the others don't."
depression,fqnyd11,t3_gjusk8,1589503846.0,Maybe. But do you want it to always be that way? How would life look if you had some self worth outside of other people caring?
depression,fqnxsa3,t3_gjsqfv,1589503521.0,"I think you're pretty much right about everything. Hobbies are a distraction from the reality that this all seems pretty much pointless and the wage slave race never ends. You expressed what most of us here feel. 

When did you outgrow all of it? When you saw all your friends and people running around aspiring, when did you decide you were over it? 

We all played with toys and games, until we didn't. We all had hobbies or played sports, until we stopped. We got bored. Life itself can be the exact same way. And when you're tired of the game of life, what's next? What's the new replacement game?

The next level is living purposefully. What's that purpose, though?"
depression,fqnw82i,t3_gjxrpq,1589502631.0,"My mother explicitly decided that her kids wouldn't be brought up in the church because of some bad experiences she had. As an adult I can understand and appreciate her decision, but looking back I can see how it impacted us three kids. We didn't have anything to anchor our beliefs to; we didn't have any explanation for what life is and why we're here. We have been more or less materially successful, but when you don't even have answers to the most basic questions of life, you will eventually have to confront that.

I started to confront it shortly after high school. I took some time off, experimented with drugs, and started asking questions. And then realized I had no clue why I was here or what I was supposed to do. That question ""what is life"" rocked my world, I dropped out of everything, sold all my stuff, and started traveling the world trying to find the answer. Although I was hostile to organized religion, like you, I realized the purpose it played in someone's life.

Just think about it. The first question is: what is life? Once you have an answer, you can then start forming some beliefs. Then you can start identifying the important beliefs among those - your values. Once those are in place, a purpose will form. And with a purpose, aligned with your values, beliefs, and idea of what life is, you can form goals and take actions to live your purpose. So deprived of any sort of foundation, what are you building your life on?

I realized a bit later in life that my values, purpose, and beliefs were there, but they all stemmed from the old American adage, ""you can be anyone and do anything"". And that is actually a terrible belief system because it tells you that ""being someone"" and ""doing something"" is the purpose. In other words, doing things that other people think are important is the purpose. AKA, being successful and recognised. And none of those people I knew who had some set of religious convictions from an early age swallowed that message as deeply as I did. They had their own issues of course, but they sidestepped some of the major challenges faced by someone who has no real spiritual foundation.

Now I spend my time trying to unravel this manufactured belief system and I've made progress. Anyway, I really understand your post. Thanks for sharing."
depression,fqnu93a,t3_gjwvt5,1589501513.0,"So do you want to stay here in the idealization phase, or move past it somehow?"
depression,fqntq5z,t3_gjppx3,1589501221.0,That's a cool method. I've lived in my head most of my life and would spend a lot of time reliving acutely negative or embarrassing moments. I had to get away from people and that solved most of those kinds of problems.
depression,fqnsvtc,t1_fqn7i7v,1589500766.0,"I've heard people say that as well. But ultimately it doesn't matter what other people did or didn't do. All that matters is what we are experiencing. There are days when I just close my eyes and imagine all the ways I would do it. And other times when I imagine finally getting there. But I have faith now and realize that one day we will all get there because that is our purpose; it's the one thing we were all born to do. Die. Get Home. 

I'm certainly not afraid of it anymore, and I don't use it to threaten life. I don't despair and feel sorry for myself. I think we do that when we don't actually understand it. But when I really understood life, and that I do have a purpose here, things changed for me. That purpose wasn't my job, or serving some imaginary god or anything; it came when I realized that my depression wasn't actually some illness or medical condition. It wasn't anything that society tells me it is. My depression was the result of being completely fucking lost in life, running around looking for a way to make the hurt go away. Accomplishment, money, sex, drugs, relationships - none of it worked. Never has. 

But when I accepted that I was lost, I realized that the only real purpose I could have would be to get home. I mean, if you woke up in some strange forest, the first thing you'd do is figure out where you are and get home, right? So that's what I decided to do. Life still hurts, but a lot of that pain comes from having no purpose in being here. But I do; my purpose is to get home. And to do that I need to sort of unravel and understand my existence. Like a puzzle."
depression,fqnrb81,t1_fqngfae,1589499948.0,"I'd say those two are the same thing. The other comes when you realise that you are lost and your purpose is to get Home. To return. You won't procreate because that makes no sense when you're lost somewhere painful and full of suffering. 

All of us who are chronically depressed want to go Home. But despair and suicide isn't really the way to get there. There is a process we need to go through to unravel the knot of life; we have to understand all of these ideas and beliefs we have because these are the knotted dimensions of our existence that we must untie.

Getting home is a purpose that can rejuvenate those depressed among us.  We are correct in feeling that life sucks and we don't belong here, we just need to take the next step, acknowledge that we're lost, and accept the mission that we do have a purpose and that is to get Home."

Crime here isn't an issue. I'm a white male, and there's a certain privilege that comes with that. But India has always felt safe for me for the past 15 years and everyone I've known both male and female has has the same experience. Just be smart, meet the locals, and you're good."

depression,fqm136r,t3_gjmk9e,1589469671.0,"So it depends where you go in India. If you go into the mountains you can rent out a room for $50 to $100 per month, sometimes even less. You're living simple, in a village, but it's rewarding. The cities are a lot more, but they're dirty and not very appealing. I started in a place called Kasaar Devi - my rent back then was about 1500 rupees, which was about $30. I lived for 4 years with no problem. 

India attracts cool people, free spirits - that's the best part. And when you need to renew your visa you can cross into Nepal and come back. There's craziness here, but that's part of the appeal of it all. I was so bored in America, and still am when I go back. So routine.
