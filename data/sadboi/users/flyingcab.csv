MyBuddy,f3ghn83,t3_dgggcw,1570911372.0,"This week has been up and down. My (I guess ex best friend and ex favorite person) has completely disappeared on me. It's been two weeks now. Last time we talked and saw each other every thing was fine. We had plans. I allowed her to put a storage unit under my name because she didn't have an ID. Then poof. Gone. We were taking and a few hours later... Nothing. Calls and texts not responding to. I dropped it. That was a Saturday. That Monday was her birthday. I sent a single text saying happy birthday. I went to check later. And her boyfriend, who I do not approve of, made her block me. It's been two weeks. I'm scared. I'm alone. I have borderline personality disorder and this abandonment is making me fall back into bad behaviors. I have 6 months safe from self harm after relapsing after almost 10 years. Ive been thinking about self harm. I've been self medicating. My car is back in the shop and needs some major repairs. I have no friends. I don't see any future in this.... World. Not actively suicidal but I can't see a life at 40...50...60... Im terrified. I'm so scared. I have no one and I'm afraid I'm going to be alone forever now. I don't know how to make friends. I don't know where to make friends. I'm so socially anxious and it makes me extremely awkward. I'm so afraid of people I don't know. I should probably shut up. Sorry for all this nonsense. I hope it makes some kind of sense."

I believed that I ""ruined"" my 10 years for a long time. But I know now that although my time has started over those 10 years are still mine, they still matter and it's still impressive. If I could do it once I can do it again.
I wish you the best of luck in your recovery and you  can and will excel in it."
confessions,f2qq8ln,t3_de09fk,1570365507.0,Congratulations!!!! That's absolutely incredible! It shows how much strength you have. I had 10 years but relapsed about a year ago but I can say I'm back on the road to 10 years again and have 6 months safe from SH.

AmItheButtface,f05k22n,t3_d3s5gt,1568411753.0,NTB. You don't need that toxicity in your life right now. I'm sure with whatever is going on with your boyfriend is having a heavy effect on you especially because you've been together for so long that any traumatic event is going to have some kind of effect on both parties. You shouldn't be have to deal with someone belittling you. I truly hope things get better for you and your boyfriend.
BadMUAs,f05jmm8,t3_d3qx1a,1568411437.0,Yup definitely getting the subtle vibes. I get that wedding makeup is very pretty with a subtle look but..... That's far beyond it. Hope you find a good MUA for the big day! Congrats!

I also just noticed that the roof of my mouth gets cold too. Through most of the research I've done I've also seen a lot of posts/info that it's a panic or anxiety attack, but as someone who experiences those it feels nothing like them either.

Would she of asked any man to move? She shouldn't expect to be catered to, then make someone else look like an asshole because they don't want to move from the seats they paid for. Then you go Mr. White Knight over here looking for pats on the back. 
I think I'm going to have to go with NTA."
