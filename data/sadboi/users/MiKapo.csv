Wilson was cool, former infantry in his late 40's with a little bit of grey hair. Had badass tats and look kind of like clint eastwood....i can't think of anything bad to say about him. He still wanted to be in the infantry but big army forced him to go to DS school, so he had this bitterness that was funny as fuck about him

Wilkes was weird. He was some quartermaster MOS that I can't remember before becoming a DS...i think it was Ammo. One time he came on his motorcycle and parked it outside our barracks. Some kind of Japanese made crotch rocket. After a while, he comes back to his bike and finds it on the ground, toppled over. He gets pissed gathers us in the barracks bay and accuses one of us basic trainees of pushing down his bike, says he will call the MP for damaging his bike. He wanted one of us in front of the entire platoon to admit to pushing over his bike. Of course, none of us admitted to it cause we know we would get arrested for that. And because no one did it

DS Wilkes finally gives up trying to blame us for the fact that his bike toppled over. Kickstand probably wasn't set right. I'm not sure, but I know it wasn't any of us that push it down. Other than that incident he was a pretty chill DS though"

States have different requirements for military truck drivers getting their CDL and only a handful of them give you your CDL based on the fact that you're in the military. In other states, you have to test like the civilians do. Civilians don't care if you were awarded the drivers badge (which i do and it doesn't mean anything to them). So the driver's badge which serves as proof that you have driven long miles on the road means nothing

In my opinion, it's not a bad MOS....it's better than some other MOS's like 74D. I did reclass to a different MOS though mostly cause im sick of just doing nothing but driving"

That is why they are threatening Eastern nations and former Soviet republics about joining NATO cause they know if they do join, they will have an influx of better equipment to deal with any Russian invasion. Russia is still very much the soviet union and Putin has even said the collapse of the USSR was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century. They are more concern about recapturing those former soviet republics rather than facing off against China

China is the bigger threat obviously but its economic system has become liberalized and dependent on free trade. They still have the authoritarian policies of the communist era but economic wise they are more capitalist than communist. Because their economics now depends on free trade, any international conflict will not be good for them."
