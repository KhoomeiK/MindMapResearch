I love receiving compliments, and I love flirting - but at the same time, I prefer to receive compliments that aren't flirtatious. They seem more genuine, as opposed to sweet-talking for an ulterior motive.

I do find compliments less interesting as a whole, but I still glow when I get a good one. I generally prefer compliments from other women. A couple months ago a girl yelled ""YO YOU'RE CUTE AS FUCK"" or something like that across a parking lot and it made my day lol"

Ok no. I get insecurity; I am extremely insecure and constantly feel ""not enough"" in relationships - not smart enough, not pretty enough, not funny enough, not dressed well enough. However - THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE. I would never push it on a partner and say that they couldn't hang out with so-and-so just because I was intimidated. I also don't care if they have friends who are girls; I'm not really jealous in that way. But the insecurity thing I get.

The stuff she's doing is more than just unhealthy, it's extremely toxic and sets off all the alarm bells in my head. If the gender roles were reversed, think of how you would feel if a female friend told you about her boyfriend exhibiting these behaviors? She has no right to be as pissed off and possessive as she is, and it sounds incredibly detrimental to your mental and emotional health.

It's one thing to support and provide a shoulder or an ear; it's another to be forced to cave to ridiculous, emotionally abusive demands.

EDIT: Just re-read your post and she's 27?! She's a grown ass woman, not a toddler. This behavior wouldn't even be okay for a 15-year-old."

Yes. I used to date him and saved him from committing suicide twice; he suffered from depression and would loudly cry out for attention and threaten suicide to manipulate me, called me his lifeline etc, even when we’d just been dating a couple weeks. I suffer from depression and those kinds of thoughts too but only communicate them with professionals or  (rarely) REALLY REALLY close friends and not in a threatening way, more in a “hey I’m having these thoughts and don’t worry I’m safe, but I’m struggling right now.” 

One of those times was when I got in contact with his mother and had her go to his work immediately; we were LDR at the time and he was enough of a dumbass/manipulator to tell me exactly what when, why, and to say a bunch of other threatening shit. 

The other time, he tried to strangle himself IN MY APARTMENT WHILE VISITING and I had to physically restrain him and wrestle with him until he gave up, crying and pleading and whatever else, and then he shunned and shamed and verbally abused me for hours.  Never even so much as apologized.

He abused me for almost a year, from the time we started dating until the very end and after I broke up with him before I blocked him on everything and moved away. 

I hate feeling this way, but sometimes I get these brief spells of rage where i really wish I hadn’t stopped him. He took advantage of me at the lowest point in my life, when I was vulnerable and young and dumb, and exploited me like the fool I was. Who knows whether he actually would have or if it was a sick sort of test to see how much I cared. But I wish he’d just jumped in front of that train like he’d threatened so vocally to do."

askwomenadvice,fpffgft,t3_gd2dbj,1588569682.0,"Preface: This is a great question! It took me a while to learn this kind of stuff, and I'm always open to new trials and tribulations. However: if I have the opportunity to save someone the trouble of going through all that, I most certainly will. Thus, I have typed up a whole novel of my own personal tips and tricks.

**General Hygiene**

Unscented bar soap instead of body wash! I like the Dr Bronner's baby soap, but any kind will do really. Also, if your skin is as sensitive as mine, I recommend using Vagisil for your vaginal/butt area. I don't wash my hair every day, but I do shower daily - not necessary for everyone, but I enjoy feeling fresh and nice after I wake up.

I like OGX shampoos and conditioners, and use their other hair products as well. They're a nice, reasonably inexpensive brand and I like the way they make my hair feel - plus, they're universally available in almost every drugstore.

Additionally, if you shave, use men's razors. They're cheaper and better-made than the average women's one. I've noticed that they're easier on the skin due to being designed to shave one's face. I use the bulldog brand, and Cremo shaving cream. I have a big problem with irritated skin and ingrown hairs, and I've noticed that this is less of a problem with men's razors and a good shave gel.

**Underwear/Lingerie**

I generally enjoy Aerie for affordable, comfortable underwear. You don't get the longest wear out of them but they have really good deals on super cute panties, and use body-positive advertising that I'm a huge fan of. I've heard their bras/bralettes are lovely as well, but if you're larger-chested it's a no go. I have a small ribcage but a large bust; I buy most of my bras from Curvy Kate. They're a bit pricey but they have some really good deals on sale - I pretty much only buy from the sale section. Also, I highly recommend going to r/ABraThatFits ! Most people w boobs are wearing the wrong bra size, and this subreddit helps find something that not only actually fits but is also flattering and comfortable. For lingerie I typically stick to black or red, as they're both classically sexy colors that are easy to match. You can't go wrong with black lingerie.

**Beauty**

I'm a big believer in ""if it works, use it"" as far as beauty goes. I use a mix of higher-end and drugstore products. Depending on your skin type, your mileage may vary. If you're into makeup, I recommend a thorough google search on your skin type, shade, techniques, et cetera. YouTube is a great resource. When in doubt, stick to neutral, light looks that accentuate natural features: smoothing skin, drawing attention to eyes with light mascara and eyeliner, a good neutral lipstick, etc.

As for skin care, a google search is also warranted. Personally, I have combination skin (leaning more towards the oily side) that's prone to acne, so I use two different CeraVe moisturizers and a natural hyaluronic acid serum, plus Dickinson's witchhazel toner. CeraVe is a great brand too - nice ingredients, affordable, approved by dermatologists, all that good stuff.

For perfume, I generally use diluted essential oils because I'm all about the natural earthy type stuff. I love rose and lavender fragrances. However, there are tons of perfumes out there, so it's up to you!

**Sleepwear/Fashion**

I would say that 95% of my clothes are thrifted. Personal style is a journey that takes a while, but you can't go wrong with sticking to the classics - lots of black, a few pairs of well-fitting jeans in the style of your choice, a denim/leather jacket, basic tees in neutral shades, a good pair of white sneakers. It's a great way to build an easy minimalist wardrobe.

As for sleepwear, most of the sites I mentioned above sell little negligees etc I think. But I generally sleep in a t-shirt/sweatshirt and panties - or just nude - and I've found that to be generally popular with guys I'm seeing. I also like a good pajama short - they have some good ones on Aerie. I have a couple of cute pajama pants/sets as well, but they've all been thrifted.

More of a ""yeah so I have trauma and please please please don't do x y z, other than that you're good"". Otherwise, there are a few friends I have who I've mentioned it to in a ""yeah I have this stuff"" but have only really gone into detail with one or two.

BodyAcceptance,fpegf96,t3_gcyb2b,1588547049.0,"OH BOY YES.

I entered puberty very early and spent most of my teenage years a little on the chubby side. Not even clinically overweight! Just ""a little chubby"". My mother frequently made little comments like ""how about trying to take off a few pounds this summer?"" or ""you don't have the body for xyz."" 

Enter anorexia at the age of 19. Suddenly, it was ""god, you're so skinny. You're too skinny. Look at your ribs! Look at how tiny your thighs are! Eat, eat!"" It was true, I was terribly thin and extremely underweight. But none of her comments ever came from a place of love to me, even though in her mind they may have. It felt like pure judgment, and I finally politely told her that it made me extremely uncomfortable, and after a few defensive snippy comments, she did stop. But it still made me unhappy, and I felt like she'd never be okay with the way I looked. Even though her opinions on my body are irrelevant and I get to make them, she is still my mother and it cut extremely deep."
ptsd,fpefki7,t3_gcwyeq,1588546588.0,"Yes!!!!! I find it pretty gross tbh - trauma is something that, at least for me, I have endless anxiety about the validity of. ""Am I overreacting? I should just toughen up"" etc - even though multiple therapists and psychiatrists have told me that my level of trauma is severe.

So when I mention it to someone and they're like ""well \*i\* have THIS"" it's really nasty. It's not even something I discuss often, so if it does happen it's really invalidating and irritating.

As someone else said, trauma and your brain's reactions to it are not comparable. Just because someone else had trauma doesn't mean that you get to decide how bad it is, and to turn it into a pissing contest is truly vile."

Plan B is no joke. I'm not on hormonal birth control and use rhythm method/spermicide/withdrawal, but I am human and lapses in judgment happen. I've taken plan b twice; once a few months ago and once literally today. I am a hormonal emotional wreck; in addition my breasts are incredibly sore, I've had abdominal cramping, and I've felt slightly nauseous all day. I would only take plan b if you weren't on hormonal contraception and your condom broke, or if you weren't thinking that much about consequences and being careless, like I was last night.

Edit: everyone reacts differently to plan b. I'm a weird mix; I'm incredibly stubborn and gave myself a potentially-fatal kidney infection by stupidly ""toughing out"" a UTI a few years ago, but I am also unable to take hormonal birth control due to it making me constantly bleed and become anemic.

Also, as someone who falls on the ""vegetarian spectrum"" so to say, you're definitely not more ethical in feminism if you don't eat meat.

askwomenadvice,fnwfy0j,t3_g3u1uk,1587317638.0,"Report her and find a new doctor. I get the small town struggle, but it's worth the drive to have someone who isn't an utter asshole.

OB/GYNs are dealing with an especially sensitive branch of medicine. They need to know intimate details about you, provide assistance, etc. Their bedside manner needs to be comforting and helpful; I'm a reasonably healthy young woman with no reproductive issues and I still shit a brick when going to Planned Parenthood for my gynecological appointments; I would imagine it's anxiety-inducing for a lot of others too. So it's important to have a doctor who is kind and knowledgeable and willing to answer even the most potentially embarrassing of questions.

Like think about it, if OB/GYNs act like the way you described, then more women simply won't go. It's tense enough going to see someone who's lovely and nice and helpful, let alone someone who is so blatantly disrespectful and flat-out mean. Doctors like her are a threat to reproductive health."

birthcontrol,fnhriqd,t3_g1lv98,1586967589.0,"I use spermicide/fertility awareness (rhythm method, I track my cycle and use ovulation strips) currently. Neither one of these is bullet-proof, but I feel comfortable enough and have never gotten pregnant. For context, the women in my family are extremely fertile (my grandmother got pregnant 10 times in maybe 8 years, Irish Catholics are something else) and conditions like endometriosis, PCOS, etc aren't problems that any of us have suffered.

I used the combination pill for years, and there were occasions where whichever partner I was with at the time finished inside me without a condom. Never got pregnant. You used THREE forms of birth control; you're totally fine. Condom + pill is plenty. 

Also it's important to note that VCF has the potential to irritate the vagina due to causing micro-abrasions; I've used it before and have been fine but your mileage may vary."

HOWEVER. This whole thing is SO cringe. Splitting couples up? Making judgments on everyone's personality? What the fuck? Also bragging about being a Ravenclaw - like seriously, that's like saying ""oh i did this shitty thing bc mercury is in retrograde."" No hate to astrology people, I am a Pisces and find it fun to compare my personality traits to those predicted by my chart. But Jesus Christ, Hogwarts Houses are a FICTIONAL GROUP BASED ON A VERY SIMPLE SORTING PROCESS and honestly basing something like winning an argument off to ""pure logic bc Ravenclaw"" is sheer stupidity really.

Also as many redditors have noted, unless you've read the books/put enough investment into them, you see Slytherin as the bad guys! And, presumably, most of the people at your wedding saw it this way. So basically, they walked into the reception and you may as well have handed them a little card that said ""congratulations, I think you're an asshole.""

Also guessing kids' houses - lmao WHAT?

confessions,fn3exes,t3_fz0s7z,1586619342.0,"I agree with others in that you should join fetish communities and learn about consensual non-consent play! After that, go ahead and get yourself a fetlife. BDSM is a very delicate thing - it has to be done right in order to insure the safety and consent of every party involved, but all that can be learned. 

Additionally, I would recommend therapy for learning how to manage this. I get that it's an embarrassing thing to talk about, but a good therapist has seen it all and this is literally their job. Lord knows when this pandemic stuff will be done, but I'm sure that there are online therapists available, or you can begin to research local therapists in order to get an appointment when this is done."

TwoXChromosomes,fn0ejqj,t1_fn06izb,1586540484.0,"Sure, accusations of sexual assault DO occasionally happen. And it’s not just a women’s issue; men can be victims as well and honestly their cases are handled even MORE poorly. 

That being said, on a cultural level, safety from sexual violence is something that women just grow up to try and PREVENT (which frankly is an unfair responsibility). And god forbid they DO get assaulted - despite me too and times up and all that - like you said the world doesn’t care. 

It takes a truly HEINOUS case with either lots of bodily harm or multiple victims (i.e. Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein) to really get anywhere. I believe Brock Turner, who DRUGGED AND RAPED A WOMAN OUTSIDE OF A PARTY, served THREE FUCKING MONTHS. I remember newspapers talking about his potential as a swimmer, how gifted he was, how sad blah blah blah. And it’s like, what about her? What about the unconscious woman he violently assaulted? I don’t give rat’s ass how much potential he had, he committed a violent crime AND was proven guilty - too bad so sad, rot in hell."

It was a comment on a video there posted about Louis CK; it was a clip of his new standup where he actively makes light of BEING A LITERAL SEXUAL PREDATOR. As someone who has sexual trauma, I found it insulting that this whole thing was really just a “hiccup” in his career and that he’s back doing standup again, let alone MAKING SPECIALS. So I basically commented saying that I found it insulting as a survivor. BOOM seven downvotes in ten minutes or less. I quickly deleted my comment, having been already upset by the video itself. I didn’t need to be reminded that a lot of the guys on reddit, and in the world, care more about “oh he’s funny lmao” than the people who have survived him and others in that same vein."
