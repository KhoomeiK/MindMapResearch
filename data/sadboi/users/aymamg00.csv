When things get similar to your situation for me, I remind myself how shitty rehab was. I have control of the situation, and so do you. 
If you feel powerless, there are na meetings online currently. (Not ideal, but still an option.)
A lot of us are on the same boat with all our free time. You‚Äôre not alone."

I skimmed this but it‚Äôs unacceptable for people in any profession to treat patients like that.

You got this."

Then, suddenly but gently, I felt the presence of a body next to me, lovingly hugging me to sleep. No part of me felt afraid anymore, I felt protected. 
A wisened spirit familiar with the facility knew they were needed. It was a safe and male presence. Building was built in 1924."
