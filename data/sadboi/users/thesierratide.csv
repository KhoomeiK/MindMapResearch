gaming,faexajm,t1_faerewv,1576010080.0,"Film student here. I have no idea where you got that info about college courses. My school has used the Last Jedi as an example in character study, focusing on the want vs. need of each character, which is SUPER important in screenwriting. This is how characters change, by realizing what they need is more important than what they originally want, and character change is the most important part of this film. 

Luke *wants* to stay on Ach-To because he thinks his status as a legend is what created Kyle Ren, and he‚Äôs worried he‚Äôll worsen the conflict. What Luke *needs* is to embrace his status as a legend in order to inspire people to rise up against the first order and end the fighting.

Rey *wants* to bring Luke back to the resistance because she thinks that only his legendary abilities will be able to save them from the first order. Rey *needs* to understand that anyone can be a legend, and she can fight for herself instead of waiting for others to help her (like her family in TFA)

Finn *wants* to leave the resistance because he is afraid of what might happen to Rey, focusing on the short term and the people around him. What he *needs* is to focus on the bigger picture and realize there is more at stake than just losing the people he loves, and being willing to fight with the resistance will help save everyone, not just Rey. 

I could go on. Just about every major character is very well written. Sure, the script has pacing problems and a couple of weird decisions, but the characters are what make the script. That‚Äôs the principle for any good film. Please take that claim that college courses think it‚Äôs an objectively bad script and put it back in your ass from where you pulled it."
