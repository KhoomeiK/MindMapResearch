Yes, low moisture is definitely key. If you can, I’d suggest using 60% cactus mix, 40% perlite. Cactus mix is ideal, but I’ve gotten away with using regular soil as well (just make sure you add 40% perlite) 

I’m not 100% sure myself, but I’ve heard drainage holes work much better than rocks, if you’re able to do so. I’m guilty of not having a drainage hole on a couple of pots myself, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you aren’t use to the signs of when a plant needs to be watered haha (wrinkly leaves on most of the plant, not firm, a little wilted etc).

There’s tutorials on YouTube on how to do it, but what I do is get a mason jar, and suspend the succulent in it with toothpicks (as in lay the toothpicks on top of the mason jar then set the succulent on that so it’s suspended) and fill it up with water and it’ll do its thing. This doesn’t work with cacti, though (to the best of my knowledge)

If not, I’d say been watering it whenever it gets wrinkly (whenever the soil gets dry) and sometimes it’ll just kinda work itself out.

Definitely check the roots though, I’ve had some that are struggling where I go to check the roots and I find a bunch of water-sucking mealy bugs to be the culprit! (Little purple/white bugs, usually found with some white sticky stuff almost the consistency of cotton candy)

succulents,fng29t9,t3_g1jhp7,1586920639.0,"Well, it all looks perfect the way you did it! :) moving forward, 

I would recommend waiting 3 days before repotting the one with roots in a dry soil, and waiting at least 2 weeks before watering. 

For the head, I would place it on top of some perlite and waiting until it grows a fair amount of roots, then you can switch the perlite out for dirt and water (if it’s looking dehydrated, otherwise I would wait a couple days if you can just to decrease the possibility of rotting). 

For the leaves I would just set out on like a paper plate or something (any dry surface really, I just use paper plates since it’s easier for me to put under grow lights) and wait until they grow roots (I’ve had some take 3 days to root, others 4+ months. So don’t give up if you don’t see progress quickly (well of course unless the leaf has rotted or shriveled up)). Once it has roots, you can set it on top of some dry soil, and sprinkle some dirt just over the roots so they grow in the right direction but not covering the tip of the leaf if you can help it so the babies grow faster/ it’s easier for them to grow :) you can water when it forms a pup if you want, but I’d personally wait maybe like 3 weeks to water (I’ve heard from other people not to water until the leaf shrivels up but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯) 

So another thing with the head - what I personally do is kind of unconventional and what’s yielded the best results for me. 
What I do is when I have a chopped head, I lay it on a rack under my grow lights (think like a cooling rack) so it’s suspended in air (the method is called air rooting) that way I can keep a close eye on it and make sure there’s no signs of rot, and if there is, I can catch it before it gets bad. Once it starts to get roots (or if it starts to get super dehydrated), I place it in a mason jar full of water suspended by rubber bands/ toothpicks (you can use any container really, I’ve just found it’s the right size for plants ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯) and then they should start growing roots in the water. I leave them be (and top off the water when it gets low) for around 2 weeks (I’ve found from experience, longer than that, and the roots start to go bad), or if they get like an insane amount of roots before that and look really plump. After I take them out of the water, I pot them up in dirt and water them immediately (no clue why this works, but it does). After a while, they should start to grow proper dirt roots and are good to go!

Sorry, this was a super long guide haha, but I hope it helped a bit :) good luck on your propagation journey! The key is knowing when to water/ when to keep it bone dry

Oh also, tip about propagation - if you get a flower stalk sometimes you’re able to cut it off and propagate that! Either the stock, the leaves, or both"
