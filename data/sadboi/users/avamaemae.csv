Anxiety,flf83vc,t3_fo7jow,1585100172.0,"i keep getting anxious and experiencing tightness in my chest and i get headaches because i haven't been sleeping well and my throat is sore because i always forget to drink water, but my mind keeps convincing me that not do i have the coronavirus but i have an extremely severe case and i am going to die in a matter of days. this is obviously ridiculous, but i can't stop it. i am so exhausted."
Anxiety,flf7vux,t3_fo6h6w,1585100025.0,"this makes me feel much better. glad to know others are also struggling. last night i had an awful anxiety attack where i felt like i couldn't breathe. my fingertips were tingling and my tongue went numb and i could hardly sleep. i keep getting headaches and sore throats and i feel phlegm in my throat and it scares me. i just have to remind myself that i'm likely getting a headache because of my lack of sleep, and my sore throat is likely just like my chapped lips, and is caused by my forgetfulness of drinking water. the phlegm is also probably because it's allergy season and i have allergies! i just have to remind myself that no one around me is experiencing symptoms and no one even in my county has been confirmed to have it. it's incredibly unlikely that i would have it, let alone have a severe case. it doesn't help much but it's better than constantly worrying."

You get the the final say always and she was way out of line with her reaction."

scythebookfans,feiuvtv,t3_ep09bj,1579147853.0,"I thought that throughout the book there were little hints of him getting more and more unhinged, especially in scenarios where he was upset. Like the mile high gleaning. He didnt think that through at all! It worked out for him, but in the moment he was all passion and rage and quoting angrily."
scythebookfans,feium2o,t3_ebmez5,1579147644.0,"I just finished it and i am reeling! The first 3/4 of the book seemed well paced to me, but once I was like 3/4 through i kept wondering of it really was the last book and was frantically googling if there would be a fourth. Everything said it was the final book. ""No way,"" I thought. ""Could it all be tied up in such a short time!"" 

God i was so wrong. The last 1/4 felt like I was on a rollercoaster and when i finally closed the book i was actually dizzy. It was so fast and kind of confusing and I think I might have disliked it but i cant tell! So much information in such a short time, I'll probably have to reread it.

 But wow. Holy shit, man! What an ending! Even if i decide that i hate it, i can confidently say that no ending has ever made me so shook! God damn!!!"

AmItheAsshole,epgmuj4,t3_bunjsh,1559215661.0,"NTA. I can see how maybe someone walking out of the store with only a jar of peanut butter might be suspicious but seriously, why would you steal only peanut butter? Obviously it's optional to do this, and they seem to pick not-so-random shoppers for it, and many greeters have just been like ""okay whatever"" before, so the fact that this guy went full on punching your car when he was supposed to be professional and respectful of the customer is ridiculous and grounds to be fired."
