I had rape fantasies where I had no control and it would be about people I knew or loved. I never talked about it to anyone at all because I was totally ashamed. I got over it a few months after starting T and learned to be more compassionate towards myself. I agree that it's possibly related to gender dysphoria and (in my case) self hatred, or displaced anger. This is something that should be discussed more often because what if there's someone who also experienced these intrusive thoughts but actually took action to it or considered?"

I haven't felt this alone in my life and makes me realize I took the social life I once had as a kid for granted. I spent the majority of high school alone because of my anxiety surrounding my identity and worrying about not being treated as the person I see myself as. I'm not happy about all this but I'm coming to terms with it. This is my life right now but surely it won't be like this forever. Someday I'll get the life I crave and you will too. It's difficult at this current phase in life but we will make it to the next. Death is tempting but sometimes it's a trap and you'll never get to live the life you wanted because you left too soon, this is a way I try to cope and hold onto hope.

offmychest,fo8dhyb,t3_fx62g9,1587594481.0,"This quarantine is starting to get to me. Being forced to stay home is worse than choosing to stay home, and I feel like I totally took that freedom for granted. Now I'm stuck at home, have no one to talk to except the family I live with and my only friend over text or call. I'm supposed to be doing my school work online but how do they expect me to concentrate when I'm stuck here for weeks, barely leaving the house, having the least amount of stimulation I've ever had in this short period of time in my life? It feels like time has stopped or life itself has been put on hold, but it isn't and the world is still moving. The world is still moving but this whole situation has me frozen. I've already fallen many credits behind in school and now I'm just falling further. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna end up dropping out even though I've tried so hard to keep going the last three years of high school. I wish this crap didn't happen and we were still in school. I was finally getting myself together to graduate only to be obliterated by this bs virus. My hope for my education is non existent, not like it was very strong in the first place anyway. Oh well, I guess I'll be dealing with the consequences in the near future. Also, not to mention the fact my anxiety is driving me nuts. I can feel depression creeping up on me and I'm in such denial that it's coming back after being better for the last year. I'm fighting to keep my mental health straight but it's so difficult right now when I'm trying to take care of my life's responsibilities."

Anyway, I'm only 2 years on T and pre-op. I still have the teeniest little bit of dysphoria left but it's so mild that it almost feels like I don't have dysphoria. Part of the reason dysphoria upset me so much was because I had really unrealistic ideation of how I should have looked. Sometimes I forget I'm trans and find myself in situations that are either awkward, gender affirming, or unsafe for me. Remembering that I'm trans doesn't make me hate myself anymore, more of minor disappointment but it's easy to get over. As hopeless as trans life seems, don't give up before you get what you're fighting for. This was the most simple way I could put it without writing more than a paragraph."

ftm,fmgf6jg,t3_fv21ig,1586047672.0,"Hey don't stress too much! I had a similar experience  when I found out about detransitioners. I questioned myself (just as you did) and couldn't make up my mind. One moment I would believe me being trans was just an act for attention and the next I would call myself crazy for thinking I'm not transgender. I was torn by those two thoughts for almost over a year until I did some deeper thinking and came to a conclusion that I am trans. It was the social transitioning part that made me question myself. I learned I was questioning back then because of the unrealistic expectations I had for my gender. For example I wanted to be this tall guy with angular facial features, broad shoulders and small hips, but of course I am the very opposite of all that even on testosterone. One thing that helped me to conclude the confusion was dressing in women's clothing with jewelery and/or ""feminine"" colors. I was too uncomfortable to leave my house presenting as female many times and knew I wasn't faking it. Went out once in one of those outfits and regretted it but hey at least I know for sure."
ftm,fmgc6uh,t3_fusqfj,1586045780.0,"On a personal note, let your kid experiment with living as a boy. If they aren't seeing a therapist, they should see a reliable LGBT-friendly therapist to discuss and help your child explore gender. I suggest that your child should see a therapist long term to see if they make up their mind and you, your child, and the therapist are confident that your child is transgender. Don't start any medical transition therapies yet. If you are comfortable with your child taking puberty blockers (aka hormone blockers) instead of hormones and it is something your child wants, speak to a doctor. It is important that you support your child and remain open to new ideas. It's also important to understand that every transgender individual do not have the same experiences/circumstances and every story is unique. Your child is at a reasonable age to be questioning their gender, especially during this day and age. Maybe you can learn more about gender with your child too. Thanks for your efforts to support your child! The support is definitely going to ease the burden of resentment of them and make deciding whether or not they're transgender easier in my experience."

I still experience the dysphoria but it's not as dreadful as it was before starting T. Honestly thought I was going to end up detransitioning because my dysphoria wasn't severe, but didn't after fully understanding the whole point of my transition and what other people thought of what I was doing didn't matter. I felt it was right for me even if others didn't agree, I chose my happiness over theirs. Just know what feels right rather than just what you want"

I had to wait one year too and it felt like it was so far away. I felt I was never going to feel happy without testosterone and attempted suicide, but survived. I ended up getting my first T shot 11 months later and cried aftwards because if I had died 11 months back, I wouldn't have been able to feel the sweet euphoria I felt that day. As much as it hurts, it is worth it all on your first T day. This may be your body now, but it isn't going to be like that forever.
