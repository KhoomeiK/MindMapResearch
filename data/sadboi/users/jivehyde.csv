It's like they're trying to use finances as a source of trying to control you when I'm reality it won't do anything at all. I'd be peeved if I were in your shoes and probably tell them I don't want their money anymore next time they try to pay. If they're going to make a thing of it and you can survive on your own financially just fine, then it might just be worth it to pay your own in order to avoid them trying to hang it over your head for petty reasons. 

I mean, they have every right to cut you off for whatever reason they want, but if they keep threatening it over and over again without making the actual move, it's pretty much a control move/bluff on their part. They just keep throwing it out there that they love the idea of having some kind of control over you. That's super annoying."

relationship_advice,fqoeody,t1_fqoalkb,1589513550.0,"Still. Even if she's the one to come forward about thinking about a job, you taking that and running with it could make her anxious. If you keep suggesting things, even if she expressed interest, that could tell an anxious person ""you don't trust me to be able to do this on my own/you don't think I'm capable. I must be a bad partner."" rather than her seeing it as you trying to help. Let her take the reigns on what she wants to do. I know you really want her to, but I sincerely suggest you just letting her do what she wants when it comes to finding a job.

If I were you, I'd let loose about it and let her do her own thing to show her that you believe she is capable of finding a job on her own. It would be very fulfilling if she did this by herself instead of ""taking the job my husband suggested I do"" you know? I know you very badly want her to get a job, so stepping down from helping is very hard for you, but she is her own woman that she needs to figure this out on her own.

If she specifically asked you for your advice or for you to help her find a job, it's kind of tricky where that would be coming from. Either she's anxious and feels like a bad partner for not working so she wants to make up for it by getting you involved (which would make her feel even worse) or she is legitimately asking for for your help. If she asks for help, make sure she is specific about it then help her very briefly and don't go overboard on it/drag it out for several days. Just do what she asked you to help with and nothing more. If she asks you to help find her job openings, ask her what she's open to, then find them and put it in a word document, and send it to her/print them out for her. Don't give them to her and have a long winded explanation for every single one or try and push her to look into anything specific. Just give them to her without saying anything,  let her look them over herself and decide for herself. If she has questions, she can go to the website for them or call somebody to get extra info or just ask you what you saw. If you see her struggling with a resume or searching, don't jump in and try and fix it. Just kiss her on the forehead and rub her shoulders a bit to help her relax. It's VERY important that you don't try to nudge her in any direction, or else the anxiety could flare up and she'll lose motivation. Just give her what she asks for and nothing more, kiss her on the forehead/tell her you love her, and go about your day (don't even tell her you're proud of her for looking for jobs, just be normal.)

I know I've typed out a lot and that I'm being very specific. Depression/anxiety is a strange monster sometimes, so just try and trust what I'm saying. DO NOT get frustrated with her. If you let loose like I said, She might sense a withdrawal and question it or get insecure about the change. Just lovingly tell her she is her own woman and she can do what she wants when it comes to a job or no job, and that you don't expect anything from her even if her getting a job would help you both financially, and that you'll love her either way, no matter what. Then apologize for how controlling/stressed/frustrated you been. 

Maybe that could even be a good opener for suggesting separate accounts as an organization tool to keep within your budget (again, please do NOT link mint to her individual account and make sure to tell her you won't be planning on putting it on mint unless she wants it there. And don't push her for either way because it should be 100% her choice.)"
relationship_advice,fqobue5,t1_fqo70gz,1589511784.0,"My husband and I have separate accounts and trust/respect eachother just fine. Our finances are split up not from a lack of trust, but because we prefer it be organized this way. We each have our own individual checking/saving and we have only one joint checking accountthat we use specifically for bills/savings only. If he pays bills just from his individual checking, he tends to spend it irresponsibly (if he sees it, he spends it.) These separate accounts help me and him budget better. In the end, it is just an organization tool for us (he wanted it more than me).

My husband supports us financially and gives me money when I need it/makes sure I'm taken care of while I'm doing school full time. I specifically calculated how much he should be sending to the joint account each paycheck and he makes sure it is sent. And I trust him to make sure sends it. He also sends money to my individual account when I ask for it/need it/when it is scheduled and I trust him to do it. He trusts me not to overspend my portion as well. We don't need to see eachother's accounts in order to trust eachother. If anything, we trust eachother even more because of it.

I am fully aware how much my husband makes, when he makes it, how much needs to be sent/where, how much I'm able to ask for within the budget, etc. He is fully aware of what I spend on my side. We made an agreement on how to set things up, and it works perfectly without damaging our trust/respect for eachother because we both ensure that we are both taken care of.

If they end up having separate accounts, imagine the trust and respect that could grow from it if she spends her part reasonably and if he stops badgering her about what she spends money on. She wouldn't have to feel pressured (because he wouldn't even have access to see her accounts on what she spends her money on) or feel like a child from his frustrated lecturing about finances, and he wouldn't have to feel like he can't trust her to keep a budget.

relationship_advice,fqo8gu7,t1_fqnt3qv,1589509735.0,"Op, since your wife is taking meds for depression and/or anxiety, maybe it's not best to push her to work. If she expresses this on her own with no push from you, then that's great. But if you keep giving her suggestion after suggestion, the pressure is definitely there and she will most likely crumble from it. Every time you suggest her getting a job or show her a job opening, it will just remind her that she's not working, which will make her feel bad, which will lead to her thinking that she's a crappy wife/mother, etc. Anxiety can have a long line of thinking processes like that, so I would just try and concentrate accepting her as she is and appreciating what she does (even if it's small). I know this for a fact because I have depression and anxiety as well. I beat myself up enough for taking naps or not doing the dishes. If my husband beat me up for it too, we wouldn't end up having a good relationship and my anxiety would get even worse/I wouldn't be able to bring myself to do anything at all. 

Stick to discussing an agreed separate account/allowance with her, and make sure she agrees to it and knows exactly what she's agreeing to. You can't just do it without her agreeing/being fully aware what it is. You can't be strict about the allowance either and end up looking through her individual checking statements every time either. You have to let loose a bit and let her be her own entity with this. Again, she might be one of those people where if she sees it, she'll spend it (like my husband) and this kind of thing could be helpful to her. And I'm sure she cares that ya'll are financially stable just as much as you do, but just needs help in learning how to control herself.

We DO trust each other and there's no financial abuse going on with him or with me. It's just how we preferred to set everything up. My bank account is never zero and nobody is being taken advantage of/being left in the dust. He could very well not be giving me anything at all but that's where my trust in him plays in -- I trust that he would make sure I was taken care of.

relationship_advice,fqo2pph,t1_fqnmrwx,1589506357.0,"My husband buys all the groceries as well since he takes care of us financially, but we prefer to go together.

relationship_advice,fqo2fcn,t1_fqnkgy7,1589506190.0,"You have it all wrong. We are two separate entities contributing under the same household in our own way, not people entitled to anything. I'm not entitled to his assets and he's not entitled to having me make him dinner every night/clean the home. These types of things are shared and/or requested, not demanded. It was logical for us to have separate accounts because we wanted to remain our own separate entities. So when he shares money for no reason or gives money to me when I ask, I am appreciative of his support and can see just how much he has given me through the account. Same goes for when I clean the home or cook food, he is appreciative of it and doesn't demand it.

When my husband and I got married, we kept our own checkings/savings separate from eachother and created a joint checkings at another bank just for bills alone. We would split the bills 50/50 back then and just funnel a set amount every paycheck into that account as soon as we got paid. But when I started doing school full-time, I couldn't do contribute anymore and he took over with his paycheck alone, covering 100% of our bills. I was VERY reluctant depending on him to take over financially, but he reassured me that everything would be okay and 2 years later everything is still okay. He had to push me to trust him with this.

Again, we honestly just prefer to have it this way because it makes things easier for us. Not everybody is the same. I can see exactly how much money I have for myself/how much he has given me at any time, we can monitor automatic bills in a separate statement from our regular accounts, he doesn't have to worry about going overboard with his spending (he had a problem with that in the past before we got married. If he saw it, he spent it. Didn't matter if he knew he had bills. This is one of the reasons why we did the joint-bill-checking account, so he didn't have to see a large amount in his main.)

My husband isn't good with finances and I pretty much made our budget plan myself before we made adjustments in our discussions, even though I'm not contributing financially atm. So I am fully aware how much he makes, how much I can ask for,  how much goes to bills, how much goes to savings, what dates he gets paid, etc. We sat down and discussed it all together and made a joint decision that this is how we preferred to handle it. My needs are more than met and I don't need to be entitled to 50% of HIS assets, nor do I care to be. All I ask is that everything financial be transparent/communicated, everything be steady financially, and that my financial needs are met. I don't need a joint bank account for that to happen because I trust my partner. It's not like he's going to get a new car without discussing it with me first.

When I go back to work, I will probably be making more than him and we will still have separate accounts and split the bills 50/50. I will be keeping whatever is mine and he will be keeping whatever is his. We are not entitled to each other's assets, but we do our best to contribute what we can in our own way because we both care about each other. We don't demand, we request because requests come from a place of love while demands do not. Maybe we're entitled to 50% of each other's assets by law, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is what we feel to be necessary for us as a couple.

Op wouldn't yank her off of the accounts without discussing it first. And op wouldn't be suggesting it unless there was actual financial trouble coming from it. She could very well be just like my husband where if she sees it, she spends it. A separate account could be a very handy tool if she agrees to it."

A simple, ""no, I don't think we can do that right now. Sorry."" will suffice if she requests too much/too often.

Just be aware that she could also take advantage of you giving her out of the budget. She could very well say that she spent her whole budget on non-necessities and needs more for necessities, forcing your hand to give her more (because, of course, it is necessary.)

I'm doing full time school right now and my husband takes care of us financially. We do just fine with separate accounts and prefer it that way. He gives me money if I ask and usually gives more than I need/asked for, which I highly appreciate. Plus, there's the added bonus of not looking through our statements and questioning everything we ever spend. He does his evaluations for his side, and I do mine without any frustrations.

Make a budget plan for her just in case she refuses to make one when you ask. So that when she says no or doesn't do it, you just whip it out and start the discussion right away. Just be reasonable. Make room for a lot of misc expense/be generous (not too generous though)."

Most couples who split can't really be friends automatically after breaking up. Gotta have distance from eachother long enough before that is even a possibility. I'd say maybe depart and live your own life without her for about 6-9 months before even considering a friendship because it sounds like she's still treating you like you're still in a romantic relationship when you're not. Don't feel bad about leaving her because she has to learn that she can't verbally abuse people she cares about and get away with it. Plus, you'll feel a lot lighter for protecting yourself from her by stopping contact."

You don't have to answer this now, not until you feel grounded again, but have you been feeling a lot of stress/depression/anxiety lately? It could be what triggered it. It's a way for your mind to cope, I suppose.

Advice,fqfms06,t1_fqflut9,1589327724.0,"Definitely not self control lol. Just found something more interesting/addicting maybe lol. I downloaded games on my phone so that whenever I got the itch to surf social media, I remembered that I had this game on my phone and just played that instead. It has to be a good game though and one to where you're limited on what you can do in one sitting. After a long time of doing that, it was easier to take my time elsewhere. I still have the games on my phone and I don't play those as often as I used to as well.

Advice,fqfljin,t3_gin3ei,1589327073.0,"I just found other things to do. I tried out games, movies, online classes, surfing reddit, reading books, etc. I still have my social media accounts, but it's rare that I ever update them or look at my feed. I'm mainly on there to check my DMs and that's it since that's how I mostly communicate with my family. Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I even took a selfie. 

Social media has a lot of vanity/shallowness involved with it. It was fun when I was younger, but now I just don't care for it (My earliest social media profile was when I was 12 years old I think.) People are always going to post stuff and try to exhume this aura of having everything together/their life is fantastic when in reality they're pretty normal/it's far from the fact. People do this face-to-face too, but for some reason it is blown up 1000x online. It's hard not to call a bunch of people I know narcissistic, because I like some people even if they do feed into an online hyperbole of a life, but there's narcissism all up in it which is not useful for anybody unless you're trying to make money selling something.

There are so many more useful things somebody can be doing other than surfing/updating their social media. I decided to explore just what exactly there was. The people who don't have social media are usually a lot more down to earth and happy too, from what I've experienced."

If she has PTSD from past abuse, a lot of people go into the hypersexual route in order to cope with it, even if it's unhealthy. I agree that low esteem and shame are huge drivers for her behavior.
