It is ok for young people like you to feel uncertain about your future. I was also not sure what I want to do while I was a youngster so I just went along with what happened. Particularly in this Covid situation, there are a lot of uncertainties for almost everyone, whether jobs or family or health. 

I would like to ask, have you shared with your parents or family about how you feel despite their expectations of you?

Rather than despising yourself, I would encourage you to take steps to learn how to be happy. I hope your school counsellor can guide you on this.

I would like to encourage you to put priority focus on your family who are accepting of you and giving you support and put less focus on your batchmates who are hurting you. 

There are many people out there who are accepting  of people with disorders/illness. I would encourage you to expand your social circle to find people who are accepting of your depression.

Yes I agree that the world does look like very bleak now and it seems like bad news are piling up everyday. But I would like to encourage you, to look harder around you and try to find some bright spots. Even with what is happening now, I have heard and seen wonderful people doing things and helping each other during this tough period. I would like to encourage you also, to have some hope and believe that no matter how bad the situation is, there is always some good happening among all the bad, and to focus more on the good rather than the bad. I would also like to encourage you to teach you to your family and close friends and share your thoughts and feelings with them. Please take care and my best wishes to whatever you do."
toastme,fkq448z,t3_fjzjwa,1584429724.0,Oh dear I'm so sorry to hear about all these terrible things happening to your life. You must be in a lot of pain right now. I hope that you can find the help you need to get through this extremely tough time. All the best to whatever you do.

SuicideWatch,fk759z3,t3_fgutq4,1583928100.0,"Read your previous posts and I am so sorry to hear about your parents' reaction to you coming out as trans. You must be in so much pain that the people closest to you are unable to accept you for who you are. Big hug for you. I do not know whether they will come to accept who you are over time but I would like to encourage you not to give up now. I am thinking that your parents may need some time for the truth to sink in and to show acceptance. By the way, have you spoken to your school counselor about this?"
SuicideWatch,fj2dzq6,t3_fb4tgx,1582941243.0,Do you want to share with us what has happened in your life?
mentalhealth,fj2duc6,t3_fb4vp1,1582941133.0,"Looked through your past posts. You have above average looks and you have a good height too. Quite surprised to hear that you haven't got a girlfriend. I think your mother is right to say keep trying and you'll get there. Other than going to clubs to meet friends/girls, do you want to consider other places like gyms, or other sports like a running group, or other hobbies or activities? It may be easier to bond with people with similar hobbies or interests other than at clubs. Please take care and all the best to you."
depression,fj2cw5y,t3_fb4wh7,1582940429.0,"Hug for you. I understand. Breakup is hard. Took me many months to get over it. I would like to suggest, that you speak to counsellor or psychologist if you are unable to confide in your family members or friends. It helped me to speak to a neutral third party (counsellor). Please take care and all the best to you."
SuicideWatch,fj2ck7r,t3_fb52mj,1582940185.0,"Sounds like you are under tremendous pressure to live up to the expectations of your family and friends but you feel so worthless and unworthy of their love for you that you decided to leave it all behind. I am so sorry to hear that you are feeling so terribly. Before you take the drastic step of deciding to leave this world, I would like to encourage you, to reach out and speak to your family and friends about how you feel, or to speak to your school counsellor. There is no hurry to leave this world. I would like to encourage you, to explore other options first before making any decision."
depression,fj2bmhx,t3_fb4yd5,1582939510.0,"Well you are young and schooling, your purpose in life at this point is to study, so you don't really have much choice on what you want to do. When you finish school and become an adult, you will have more choice on what you can do and you can find a purpose in life. In the meantime, even though you are still constrained by school life, do you want to consider doing little random acts of kindness to make someone's day? I find that helping others also makes me feel better about myself."
depression,fidc643,t3_f7k3tk,1582365269.0,Big hug for you. I am so sorry to hear about you losing your dad. Indeed it hurts a lot a lot to lose a loved one. Wishing you strength.  Please take care.
SuicideWatch,fid9o2w,t3_f7nifr,1582364482.0,"Sounds like you have some very bad friends who are bullying you. If I am you, I will cut them off immediately. Who needs enemies with friends like these? 

By the way, have you shared your friendship problems with your family? How about your school counsellor?"

SuicideWatch,fh6820k,t3_f1i59m,1581296064.0,"Same here but it has been several years and I have adjusted to it. In fact I was the one who cut off the ""friends"" who only contact me when they need me but don't want to help me when I need them. I felt much peaceful and much happier instead of getting upset over these one-way friendships. I also always do things alone an I am ok with this (never felt self pity for myself lol)."
mentalhealth,fgrd2q0,t3_f03y3i,1581043856.0,"Oh dear, I am so sorry to hear that the one person who observed your breakdown don't even bother to ask or say anything. Big hug for you to show that I care.  It is very unfortunate that some of us have no one in real life to turn to when we need help. Do you want to share what lead to your breakdown? We may not be physically present with you but we can listen to you."

toastme,fedcclm,t3_eokrx3,1579007435.0,"You are good looking and ozzing with charisma and a certain amount of confidence. For sure you don't look like a loser. I bet the girls always take a really long look at you or find some opportunity to approach you. 

Different people go through different stages in life at different times. I would like to encourage you to focus on your own goals and progress and not to compare yourself with others. 

All the best to your PhD and to achieving whatever you want in life."
