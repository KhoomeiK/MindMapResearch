adhdwomen,fr3uc56,t1_fqiimkp,1589866500.0,"Dear god, you just described BOTH of my parents. And both of them are white, middle class, and college educated. However, my mother's parents grew up during the Great Depression and both put themselves through college with sheer hard work at their jobs. My dad's father worked on the Holland Tunnel in NYC as a manual laborer and went to night school to get his college degree. My dad's mom didn't even go to college. 


My dad has ADHD, as do his brothers, and hasn't been medicated a day in his life. It took him 6 years to get through college and he is firmly anti-medication treatment for ADHD in general, but does admit it seems to have help me in many ways. What he fails to see is how his ADHD could very well ruin his marriage to my mom and him not addressing it when he KNOWS he does things that irritate my mom is a huge disservice to her. It pains me to see them fight over things that could be fixed so easily



I also got into an argument about making college free/affordable for anyone who wanted to attend. To me, I want to live in a more educated society and opening up higher education to make it more available seems like a good way to do that. My mom lost. Her. Shit. when I told her that. Her argument boiled down to two things: 1) not everyone needs to have a college education and 2) I did my time and paid my loans and others should do the same. 


I personally find both arguments to be selfish, but that's just my opinion. I would rather live in a society where people are able to gain knowledge for the sake of learning rather than limiting it to those who are lucky enough to be able to afford college. But I'm just some dumb millennial. What would I know about the real world?"

We deal with influenza on a regular basis and know how to treat it these days, so it doesn't cause the sort of panic in the scientific community that a new virus causes.

Docking tails isn't meant to be cruel, it's meant to keep the dog from having their tails broken by the hooves of sheep or goats, or getting it caught in farm equipment. That is why the breed standard for having docked tails or no tail exists in the first place.

irishsetter,foqko6g,t1_foqawgo,1587995674.0,"So there are actually two independent breeds of Irish Setters. The traditional coloring is red and white, but the breed is rare these days after selective breeding for a red coat starting back in the late 1800s. Today, most of what you find is show lineage red Irish Setters and they have developed a reputation over the years for being high strung and nutty dogs. I'm definitely biased since my family has a field hunting Irish Red and White Setter, but field lines will be smaller, have shorter coats that require less maintenance, and have a reputation for being very friendly and obedient dogs. I've never met a field bred setter of either color variety that wasn't an absolute sweetheart and didn't ADORE their humans. My old man dog is 45lbs. but is also unusually small. Female field setters should be about 45lbs. and males should be about 50lbs or so.

ADHD,fon6o94,t1_fompfqw,1587913403.0,Depression exacerbates problematic ADHD traits so it's probably both of them affecting you at the same time.

adhdwomen,fok1123,t3_g7qeko,1587833361.0,"I have a variation of it! In fact, about 40% of the population has this gene mutation and would benefit from folate supplements because their body doesn't absorb it properly. I personally take 15mg of L-methylfolate and using GoodRx, it runs me about $30 a month instead of like $80 out of pocket. The only requirement for my med is that I eat beforehand or it will make me nauseous, which my Wellbutrin does as well so no change in routine for me."

She's the sassiest rabbit I've ever met and I had no idea she was when I adopted her, but she's totally perfect for me. She's also very open about showing her pleasure as well as irritation and that's a really great reward for me ❤️"
polandball,fo5kpm0,t1_fo4ogs0,1587528040.0,"Actually, the ship didn't decay at all and that's what makes it so incredible. Stockholm's harbor isn't a saltwater harbor and is cold enough that wood-eating microbes can't grow in the brackish water, which is how the ship managed to be preserved so impeccably. 



Fun fact: the ship sank in the first place because the king of Sweden got greedy and wanted a SECOND row of canon portholes instead of the normal single deck. On its maiden voyage, a gust of wind caused the ship to list just far enough over that the second row of canons was suddenly below the waterline and the ship immediately started filling with water and that was the end of the *Vasa*. Protip: bronze is heavy. Don't try and put 72 canons on a ship not designed for 72 canons."

I go to a university known worldwide for its engineering school and nationally for its agriculture school, so like 80% of the guys that go here are in one of those two colleges 🙄 Also, the student gender ratio of men to women is like 6:4 so there's a lot of very nerdy guys (which I truly don't mind) that will go out with any girl that shows interest. And it's hard for me to discern who is going to be an awkward date over text."

Also, GeneSight isn't the only company that does these tests; it's just the one that I happened to use myself."

askwomenadvice,fnu8dfy,t1_fnu47f7,1587256660.0,"The stupid thing is, the medication can be prescribed for things other than preventing conception without violating any moral tenants of the Catholic Church. If the primary purpose is to prevent cystic acne, for example, but the medication has the side effect of preventing ovulation, a Catholic doctor could prescribe the medication without going against their conscience. Most don't because it looks bad to Catholic hospital systems and intent behind the prescription is a murky grey area and a huge hassle for them usually. Others really just don't want to deal with birth control at all and are assholes about it."

adhd_anxiety,fnntnpj,t1_fnnjxvg,1587101388.0,"Strattera made me feel like I wasn't losing my mind every single night since it's a drug that is designed to be in your bloodstream consistently, unlike stimulants. I could actually get out of bed in the morning and get ready for my day without forgetting what I was doing 1000 times. It's also not a controlled substance so it doesn't require an insurance pre-authorization and it's not $300 like vyvanse is either. I pay like $75 a month for my Strattera and I honestly never want to go back on a stimulant if I can help it. Strattera has made me feel human and given me just enough focus to live my life like a slightly disorganized normal person. I may need an IR stimulant booster in the future to help me focus on school, but Strattera has given me a solid baseline to work from."

adhd_anxiety,fnnsh81,t3_g2qrua,1587100394.0,"Have a GeneSight test done (there's a sliding fee scale for the test as well and you won't ever have to pay more than $300). Your body may process certain stimulants too quickly or you may have a folate deficiency that can have a big impact on medication efficacy (~40% of the population doesn't process folate correctly). I was on Concerta for 10 years and even though it's supposed to last 12 hours, I knew mine wore off after 8 and everyone brushed me off. I could also tell that I wasn't getting the full effects of the Zoloft I was on even though I was at the top dosage of 200mg. It felt like I was on half the dose the bottle said I was. Lo and behold, my body processes Zoloft too fast! I got switched to Prozac and now I'm feeling more effect from 20mg of Prozac than I ever did at 200mg of Zoloft, even though they're both SSRIs.



Believe me, I didn't even know genetic testing for drug metabolism was a thing until December or I would have done it YEARS ago. It takes out like 80% of the guesswork in trying medications and allows you to find the right meds quicker. It's truly a godsend."
dating,fnlsnvs,t1_fnlrhuq,1587059041.0,That's the thing.... One would think that continuing to text and asking to make plans for a second date would indicate that someone is interested. I've been stood up more than once after making plans for a second date too :(

TwoXChromosomes,fnlgnho,t1_fnjspe5,1587053219.0,""" *'ohana* means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten."" -Lilo and Stitch


I come from an enormous family and my philosophy about family relationships has always been this: family should ALWAYS love each other, but you don't always have to like each other. In other words, when shit goes sideways and you don't know where to turn, your family should be the first to step up and have your back and best interests at heart. But this doesn't mean that they won't occasionally piss you off or annoy you from time to time. 



Your boyfriend's family sounds like the kind of people who you know will have your back when it's you against the world ❤️"
