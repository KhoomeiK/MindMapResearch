dankmemes,ezwywdk,t1_ezwwqek,1568228244.0,What did I do :(
schizoaffective,ezw0btn,t3_d2kfra,1568204151.0,"I don't know if this will help but I have these episodes where I lose focus and can't function normally and I sometimes have intrusive thoughts.. I talked to my doctor and I dont know if you're experiencing the same thing but my doctor said this was obsessional thoughts and part of an OCD weird how it didnt show until 3.5 years after my diagnosis with schizoaffective anyway these episodes happen out of a sudden and sometimes they go away sometimes I take medication for them which is 2 bromazepam 1.5 pills.. goes in 30 mins. Otherwise if I sleep they're gone.

Edit: also I should note that the doctor told me prozac is the best medication for this kind of thing since bromazepam only treats the symptoms and not the root cause. I tried prozac but after the chemistry settled down in my body I couldn't ejaculate for shit like I have an orgasm but nothing comes out so I immediately stopped it and continued with bromazepam after the episode happens.. bromazepam is a benzo like xanax and lorazepam but much less addictive"
schizoaffective,eyhkk0r,t1_eyf9f1z,1567088607.0,I'm depressive type too and I'm on invega injection 100 mg once every three weeks or 6 mg pills everyday if the injection isn't available. I'm not on antidepressants and I must say I feel good I credit it to the invega because it's a good schizoaffective disorder medication
schizoaffective,eyefxi4,t3_cwqe43,1567033228.0,Oh my god exactly what I'm feeling. Idk if you feel this too but I'm being so nice and I hate it cause some people are starting to take advantage. Like sometimes even when my friends engage friendly banter with me which is sometimes offensive I dont fire back because I don't want to offend anyone or more precisely I don't want anyone to suffer.. one of my closest friends pointed this out and told me I'm being too nice and I need to stop. I literally bend backwards for people and I can't seem to stop
schizoaffective,eyefhcw,t1_eyef4kl,1567033047.0,Also I'd like to mention that this can be a side effect of one of your medication (antipsychotics if you're on any) they basically numb you emotionally the best thing you could do is tell your doctor maybe try a different type of medication that's if you're taking any
schizoaffective,eyef4kl,t3_cwrsyn,1567032903.0,Firstly I would recommend telling your doctor this and well I'm not a professional but I guess you gotta meet people and if you dont like getting out there try bumble.. if you have friends and you're still having this issue try distracting yourself by finding a hobby.. maybe even travel if you can cover the expenses.. for example I went bowling with a friend two weeks ago and the way he threw the bowling ball in a way that made it curve (I had no idea this could be done) got me really interested in bowling and I kept bowling with friends till I got the spin right and now I feel one of my hobbies is bowling. Also try to be around family if it helps and they are supportive (I hope).. maybe find a friend you can confide in as an alternative.. I really hope this helps
schizoaffective,eybutj8,t1_eybu0am,1566992220.0,Well atleast he's honest my doctor has me hoping I can stop invega in February 2021 but I feel like he's just saying that to put my nagging about stopping the medication on hold.. maybe he's lying maybe it's my paranoia haha
schizoaffective,eyb2mim,t1_eyan18s,1566974645.0,You will be hopefully don't worry about it schizoaffective is very manageable at this day and age
schizoaffective,eyb2k6h,t1_ey9jp2y,1566974599.0,That's very true
schizoaffective,eyb2jd8,t1_ey92s5s,1566974583.0,Woow now that's the life!
schizoaffective,eyb2ibm,t1_ey8m5o1,1566974562.0,I'm gonna look into it because I'm having sexual problems myself
schizoaffective,eyb2gsz,t1_ey8kbho,1566974535.0,Well the good thing is I heard we dont have to take invega forever... or do we ?
schizoaffective,eyb2f2n,t1_ey8vumv,1566974504.0,It's good to hear that
schizoaffective,eyb2e18,t1_ey91zew,1566974486.0,Nice latuda must have zero side effects or something.. did you try invega tho?
schizoaffective,eyb2avt,t1_ey8opdt,1566974431.0,Hopefully you won't have any symptoms anymore ðŸ‘Š
schizoaffective,eyb27y9,t1_ey9pugu,1566974384.0,Makes a lot of sense thank you
schizoaffective,ey64fy4,t3_cvqe4g,1566847200.0,I'm on a 100 mg invega injection every 3 weeks which is almost 6 mg a day. I've been taking it for 4 years now and doctor says I can stop it in a year and  half since I'm completely fine now it's like I'm normal on my meds
schizoaffective,exl4y66,t1_exl27sy,1566406029.0,Seriously? When you tell them your diagnosis they dont hire you ?

Drugs,est9att,t1_esqs5t1,1562263968.0,I know right I've had like 2 psychosis episodes because of weed and I'm always searching for a drug that doesn't induce psychosis.. pregabalin is fun but it's withdrawal sucks ass.. any insight?
dubai,esscud0,t3_c8zi6v,1562249585.0,Amazon sucks horribly I miss souq so bad
schizoaffective,essauph,t3_c92ja8,1562248459.0,Well I was on some of them.. seroquel used to knock me tf out and make me eat so much.. I was never on abilify but I begged my doctor to switch it with the invega I take because it has less sexual effect and lorazepam just made me plain dumb hahah I think it has a dumbing effect
schizoaffective,erpa39x,t3_c37ojr,1561107400.0,Let's freaking gooooo!!! Glad to hear that!
schizoaffective,erm96d4,t3_c2rxv5,1561011027.0,"""Not as bad as someone with this diagnosis could be"" ? Come on man we're all sza here"
schizoaffective,erg5gxy,t1_eqwhbad,1560827002.0,Yess I'm on invega too and I really want to switch to ablify since the side effects are less but my doctor says it's not as strong as invega and also switching medication after 3 years is tough. My main problem is when I'm doing the hanky panky sometimes I cant ejaculate and have to fake it like Chandler in friends did once (learned it from him). For my depression I might take prozac soon but I hear it makes people gain so much weight and I dont wanna go back to that phase my BMI is finally 24.8 after being a whooping 46.3
schizoaffective,erg1qc2,t1_erg1muk,1560823925.0,Just aren't capable of having a healthy relationship but that's just what I read online.. statistics basically.. Google does us badly ðŸ¤£
schizoaffective,erg1naa,t1_erg1htp,1560823858.0,Hahaha yes but some harm that isnt physical can do your mental health state poorly and fuck all your progress up.. just becareful and make sure the person you love is worth it
schizoaffective,erg1g2l,t1_erg1ap4,1560823695.0,Ohh okay then I'm sorry to say it but he's an idiot.. let us know if you find someone and it works out we'd be happy for you. I'm still under the assumption that people like us cannot commit especially males because scientifically more females end up in families than guys with our diagnosis.. a hard pill to swallow indeed but should be swallowed anyway
schizoaffective,erg15q3,t1_erg0p69,1560823461.0,"I believe, and that could be just me (I'm not saying everyone else is wrong), that a person should be at peace with all his or her flaws (not trynna sound like a monk) and fill his or her own void not by using another person before seeking a relationship. And then you could look for people who are also the same not just trying to fill a void and you could see if something works. And not every guy is just looking to bed women personally I was played in my last relationship because the girl felt lonely and she faked an entire relationship for the attention when all I wanted was someone to be genuine to me. But I'll tell you this. If you're gonna commit you need to stop talking to online people once you find ""the guy"" because nothing hurts more than your own girlfriend talking to other guys for fun. Like he would think: what's up come to me I'll give you all the fun in the world or: am I not enough fun"
schizoaffective,erfzre4,t1_erfzevh,1560822362.0,"Maybe you can depend sometimes but I dont think it's safe to be under circumstances or in a relationship where if the person leaves you will be crushed, depressed and wouldn't know how to live without them because just like money people come and go"
schizoaffective,erfz26y,t3_c1umbh,1560821818.0,All I know is you shouldn't use a partner to fill the potential void in your ego because that would be being dependant and people like us should work their hardest to be good on their own and not depend on someone especially someone who isnt family yet. No one can tolerate us like family and we should learn to be complete or atleast as most complete as we can
schizoaffective,eqi55v4,t3_byfzvt,1560079250.0,Invega which is an antipsychotic personally for me made me gain a lot of weight but on the other hand saved my life I take a shot every 3 weeks and if it wasnt for that I'd go batshit crazy however since we're schizoaffective we're bound to having either depression or bipolar for me it's depression and I hate anti depressants and refuse to take them cause I really do feel that they are placebos
schizoaffective,eomswgb,t3_bsdpgt,1558695646.0,Schizophrenia doesn't always have to be about hearing voices it can be about having delusions.
