Mirtazapine_Remeron,fqf37nf,t1_fqdeqaj,1589317963.0,I'm on 45 mg now. I had increased anxiety for about 3 months before deciding to increase the dose. Is there anything triggering your anxiety right now? Sometimes it can be temporary. The increased dose was a lot for me to handle. It actually worsened my anxiety for the first 2 weeks.

It's common to experience increased mental health symptoms when you're pmsing. If you have anxiety pms can trigger an anxiety attack.  


I had anxiety attacks for most of my childhood and teenage years. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 17. I didn't realize it was anxiety until it got more severe.  


It does sound like anxiety. It sounds like you're doing so already but it is useful to track your anxiety to discover patterns and to find what triggers them. I'd recommend googling ""mindfulness"" as it can greatly help when you're feeling anxious. There's even mindfulness apps that can help. The best thing is to see a professional to make sure there are no physical causes but mindfulness is a great tool regardless of your situation."

When I've needed refills on a medication I took my prescription bottle to the doctor with me and they gave me a prescription from that but that was years ago. I now have it set up so that my GP and psychiatrist share notes so they're both on the same page. I'm not sure how the referral process works where you are. A good place to start is to ask the receptionist at your psychiatrist but generally most referrals come from GP's.

I had desperately needed a break and was able to get one without feeling like I was yet again different than everyone.

Something to note is that it did take my body around 6 months to adjust to not having a gallbladder. Especially in the first few weeks I found foods that hadn't been a trigger before became difficult to manage.

Most doctors will recommend talk therapy as the main form of treatment for anxiety. See a different doctor and ask about what your options are and ask if they think medication for anxiety like a benzodiazepine will work in the short term.   


I've found that medication has helped me get through the rough patches so that I'm able to handle individual counselling and groups. That said I had years of anxiety before making the choice to take medication.

They don't fully understand what I'm going through but the simple act of them being there makes all the difference. Even something as simple as a text message can have a great effect.

I've found the pressure to keep a routine during all of this has been too much for me. I had a great routine going when everything was normal and I'm still grieving that loss.Instead I've been trying to do one positive thing a day. Once I do one positive thing it's easier to do more. My definition of positive has a wide range. Some examples: exercising, actively doing things with family (like scrabble or gardening), cleaning, journaling, reading, and using online tools for my mental health. I find my emotions have been amplified and any act of self care makes a difference.  


For what it's worth I've been on a lot of different medications, had more side effects than I knew existed, and still recommend medication. It's a frightening path to go down but when a medication works it relieves so much pressure.

Ultimately what helps is unique to each individual. It's worth it to try everything and then try it all again. I find different things have worked well at different points in my life."

I was struggling today and rather than worsening it be being around others I took some time for myself. Time seems to help the most.  


It's an extreme reaction to extreme emotions. I feel like it happens because in my own twisted way I'm trying to get others to understand the pain I'm feeling.

If you are feeling like hurting yourself try calling a crisis line or seeing if there is an online chat option available in your area.

BPD,fo5jds6,t3_g5rca1,1587527086.0,"When I was first diagnosed no one had spoken to me about it.

I was in an emergency room before anyone really knew the severity of what I was going through. I wished I would have been able to get help sooner but I'm not sure if I would have accepted the help. I was in denial for an extremely long time.   


It's been 11 years since that happened. I'm fairly open about my mental illness and so people tend to talk to me when they're struggling which I'm grateful for. I didn't have anyone I could talk to and that made it hard.    


I want you to know that you are not responsible for your parents relationship. I'm sorry your dad put that pressure on you. Do keep in mind that no matter how old someone is they are still learning.   


The best thing you can do is to spend time with them in low pressure environments. Watch tv with them, go for a walk, do something they like. They won't be able to hear what you have to say unless they're comfortable. For now stay away from the more serious topics. It's safer that way.   


I do recommend that you talk to a professional. There are people you can call. Try googling mental health services in your area. I know in my area there is a crisis line and a line to speak to a nurse. You are experiencing a difficult time in your life. Talking to a professional is completely valid."

In the morning I have 2 alarms set 20 minutes apart. The first one to wake me up and the second just in case I fall back asleep. I go for a short walk first thing and that tends to help get my brain going. I've had this routine going for a year and now I wake up naturally 5 minutes before my alarm.  


I know with being an insomniac bedtime routines don't always work but I found the morning routine more helpful. It's far easier to wake up than fall asleep.

I finished the course with a 97 average.   


Would getting high marks be a great opportunity for you? Definitely. But you have to start somewhere. The reality is that you already have. By breaking everything into small tasks you made an effort.

I have an anxiety disorder in addition to bpd and the primary medication I take is Mirtazapine. It has a lot of side effects so I wouldn't recommend it as a first choice but you should ask about newer SSRI's and SNRI's. You won't know if a medication will help unless you try it."
