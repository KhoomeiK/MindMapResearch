depression,fniek9k,t3_g1jxci,1586978661.0,"I'd never found a way to express that feeling of ""feeling safer as a failure"". In my own experience, I was always pushed to be at the top as well, only I was forced to do it all alone since I was a little kid because I was smart and they thought I didn't need any help. Growing up, I always felt so alone in everything. Sacrificed having friends over having the best grades so my parents would love me. Then I started finding myself, only to be rejected by them for being queer. They were my only purpose, and suddenly they turned their backs on me. I didn't feel smart anymore. I didn't feel capable of doing things on my own. I started failing at school like crazy, from top of the class to the tail end. I refused to learn, something that I loved, because it was all for nothing. They wouldn't love me anyway, because I was just born wrong. There were so many things I already blamed myself for, from their divorce to being an economic burden, feeling guilty for being a kid with needs. Soon started with alcohol and drugs. Something I was good at, could chug the most and smoke a lot before losing my mind. I regret being exposed at such a young age. And I regret refusing to learn, because now I feel like a real failure, too many blanks I can't possibly fill in my lifetime. And still, I have to say I am lucky. I still have my parents, and they've learned to love me as I am, mostly. We were broke for a long time, but now things are way better, and I just can't get used to having money now. I feel guilty spending. And most of all, I can't find a real purpose. Can't do anything for myself. I'm alive only for my mother, because she has lost so much, she couldn't bear losing me. And while I can't help but resent her a bit, I would do anything and everything for her. I just wish I could do things for myself, and not think I'm destined to fail.

Sorry to crash your post with all this, it just came out. And idk if you ever want to talk, were the same age and I relate a lot to all that you've just said. I'm on twitter as @M0RNINGS7AR just in case."
