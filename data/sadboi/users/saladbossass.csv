I feel the same way. And this current isolation is nothing compared to the isolation you've been in all you life. I just wanted to share that I often listen to George Harrison, one of the Four, and his songs give me life, though it sounds pompous probably.

Just to name a few of his songs: My Sweet Lord, What Is Life, This Is Love, Here Comes the Sun, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth), While My Guitar Gently Weeps (it's the Beatles' song, but he wrote it). He has this soothing voice perhaps that it makes me peaceful for a while.

And because of George I found out about The Traveling Wilburys, shame on me I've never heard of them. Listen to ""End Of The Line"", if you find time.

And thanks for your kind words!"
raisedbynarcissists,fnt1b6b,t3_g3ot94,1587232715.0,"It makes me mad and sad at the same time, because it's true. I don't wanna see or hear my father, but I still live with my parents, as everything is so expensive nowadays. And this lockdown just makes things worse. I try to imagine that he is not in the same flat as I, but he smokes in the toilet and it just stinks very badly of cigarette smoke, he is also an alcoholic and yesterday he started drinking. He thinks only about himself. I tried to answer back many times but it's useless. He thinks he is the best around. And one of his ""reasons"" for drinking is that his children haven't given him grandchildren yet, as he wants to take care of them and play with them...

Of course my parents provided me with food and clothes, but we didn't have any 'real' conversations. I've always been amazed when some people told me their mother/father is their best friend... Never ever had we really talked. Another thing that I realized is that our mum doesn't believe in her children. I have a very low self-esteem, I understand it, but I think I won't be able to overcome it. I'm somewhere at the bottom.

Everyone (including my mum) says the drinking problem is an illness and that my father can get better only if he himself wishes so, but my mum doesn't seem to think what impact his behaviour has been making on their children. It's like: let's wait till he cures himself! Everyone knows it will never happen and so everything stays the same, only my mental health is quickly declining.

Yeah, and one more thing. Once when I lost my temper and started yelling bad words at him, when he was drunk, he accused me of being hard-hearted. Great. Making your own kids emotionally unstable and self-conscious is better of course.

Sorry for venting and thanks for the post!"
