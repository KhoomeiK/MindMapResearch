AmItheAsshole,f2ypsqg,t3_delta8,1570495604.0,"YTA. Idk so much about the dictator part, but I had to switch my major freshman year because even though I had my heart deadset on being a mechanical engineer, I hated it. 

A lot of people I know ended up changing majors as well. The job prospects and future are definitely an understandable concern, but if she switched this early, you should let her explore what else college has to offer and let her figure out what she wants to do. Don’t pressure her into switching back into something that she clearly doesn’t like. Your approach wasn’t the best in asking her why she switched and what she didn’t like, and to be fair her blowing you off wasn’t right either. Talk to her and give it time."

Honestly man, you’re gonna get out of it what you put into it. Having a closed mindset and avoiding your problems is probably going to lead you back, but actually talking about it helps and trying to understand.

End of the day, you know yourself better than your friends do, so you gotta do what you think is best. If you think therapy is worth a shot, then absolutely. No harm in trying."
me_irl,ewgeb3a,t1_ewg71b4,1565379925.0,"Hardly anybody in the United States owns an automatic weapon. You’re greatly misinformed, if that’s your belief. 

If you’re referencing semi automatic weapons (where each pull of the trigger fires a round) then where would you like to draw the line there? Semi automatics are widely used in hunting dangerous game such as wild boars and are probably most suitable for protection from bears, both of which having as much ammunition in a magazine that you can matters. 

I don’t feel threatened much of anywhere in the United States same as you don’t feel presumably threatened in Europe. Believing every thing the media tells you, especially when it’s wrong or not true is a great disservice."
