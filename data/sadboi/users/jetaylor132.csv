Anxiety,fqw9z03,t3_gl6u7j,1589697224.0,"Yes and it’s awful. Every night before I go to bed my brain will loop some of the worst memories of my life, mistakes I’ve made, stupid shit I’ve said. I’m getting better at letting go and stopping myself from getting sucked into this but it’s been a lifelong problem for me. Like I really need to hate myself for something that happened in grade 10 as a reasonably successful 40 year old woman. Ugh."
offmychest,fnr9bb8,t3_g36tqw,1587182521.0,"My orthodontist did the same thing to me.  He also fixed my bite so I couldn’t bite my nails anymore, which translates to me forever being unable to properly incise anything like lettuce in a sandwich or meat on a pizza. He also was a disgusting sadist who was missing a thumbnail and refused to wear gloves. I feel your pain 😣"
ADHD,fi1wx4p,t3_f5urhp,1582066471.0,"Good for you. I’m the parent of an ADHD kid and I hear this from the school, my family and even my husband. Our kids need to have their “person” that loves them unconditionally and helps them be successful. And if it means working around issues like disorganization and forgetfulness then so be it. All I hope is that my son finds his place in the world and lives a meaningful life, no matter what that looks like. Not all kids do well in educational settings that lack flexibility and where the only tool that people seem to have is a hammer. Well done!"
ADHD,fcphycp,t1_fcphrdp,1577864815.0,That sounds like a decent trade off. Hope you’re happy and well 🙂
ADHD,fcph71u,t1_fcpgb0o,1577863890.0,He definitely suffers from depression and anxiety so we are doing our best to balance appropriate medications to help him function at his best. Meds aren’t the answer for everything of course but I notice a huge difference in his ability to cope since he’s been on concerta.
ADHD,fcpfzn7,t1_fcpfvcd,1577862311.0,Thank you so much! I will definitely check into the things you have recommended

Thetruthishere,f3oke03,t3_dha98r,1571020290.0,"When I was very pregnant with my oldest son (2002) my grandfather had prostate cancer. I was living about 8 hours away at the time and unable to travel. I went to bed like any other night, and I had a very vivid dream that my grandfather was standing at the end of my bed smiling at me. He looked strong and full of piss and vinegar like I remembered him from when I was young, not yellow and sickly and ravaged by cancer. 

I woke up in the morning feeling extra run down and tired. The phone rang at 8 am and it was my sister telling me my grandpa had died during the night. I already knew. It was a very moving experience and I fully believe he came to say goodbye before he left."
Anxiety,eykep4z,t3_cx9kkt,1567147811.0,"My anxiety is always worse at night too. I could stay up all night gagging and kicking my feet at dumb things I did in elementary school that nobody could give a care about.  And I’m a 40 year old mom of three. Big hugs, wrap yourself in a burrito blanket and watch an old movie that you love. Sending big squishy mom hugs 💗"
depression,eykej4q,t3_cx1nlm,1567147582.0,Big squishy mom hugs from a mom who suffers from chronic depression. We are all just doing the best we can. 💗
ADHD,eykdjsy,t3_cx8l03,1567146278.0,Fantastic! A big hug from the mom of an ADHD kid. Way to advocate for yourself and get the supports you need. Killing it 👌🏻

Anxiety,ermbeoo,t1_erllp3y,1561013850.0,This. When I’m stuck in an anxiety loop I feel like I will certainly die if I leave the safety of my house. One foot in front of the other and I can manage. Barely.
Anxiety,erf17u5,t3_c1nf3g,1560797618.0,"I’m on day 3 of a terrible anxiety episode after going out Friday night. I was with old high school friends and had too much to drink, then unfortunately had a massive allergic reaction to something at the bar and had to take a Benadryl. I completely blacked out and woke up at home in bed the next morning. The lost time is the most horrible, gut wrenching, skin crawling feeling. My friends say everything was fine but I’m still so physically sick with anxiety I had to leave work today and get back in my duvet burrito 😖"
