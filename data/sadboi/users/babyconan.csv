If you playing too slow and the tees are wide open in front of you either let the people behind you play through or speed up, don’t speed up to the point of rushing though, you paid your fees so play. As long as your not taking 20 shots on the same hole your fine man. Have fun and enjoy being outside with your buds. Drink a few beers, get excited when you make those great shots, don’t get down in the dumps when you top it and it goes 10 feet in front of you(going to happen a lot) just have fun that’s the biggest part."
