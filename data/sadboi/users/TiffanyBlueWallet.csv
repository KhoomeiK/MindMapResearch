physicaltherapy,fosqr4m,t1_foskoeq,1588036105.0,"so you get paid per hour?  and not per visit? that's sweet.  we get paid per visit, and the pay rate is different depending on if it's a oasis piece,  recert, SOC, ROC, or just an eval, or visit.  If I got paid per hour, things would have been much nicer on those days where it took 65 minutes just to get to the pts house"

ptsd,ewwuspf,t3_cqb6o4,1565835906.0,"For about the 1st year after my dx,  I couldn't eat.  It is your sympathetic nervous system (it's an automatic one) and it's responsible for your Fight or Flight reactions.  It controls all sorts of automatic reactions in your body (increased heart rate,  widened pupils, etc  all those things you need when you're running for your life) But, you also don't need to be hungry.  

My constant Fight or flight finally started to wane when I met someone that my body apparently trusted.  The first sign:  I got hungry around him :)  My stomach hadn't growled in so long...  and when I was around him, I calmed down enough for the F/F rxn to turn off (or at least chill a bit)."

fatlogic,eszr0hb,t1_eszqgox,1562366457.0,The heart issues only apply if the person has prolonged  HTN.  Dehydration for a show is a small period of time.  Any trainer worth their salt will know how to take a client down safely.   The pros know too.   it's the chf resultant from the HTN and fluid overload that's the problem.

Because,  guess why?!?  -gasp-  he was FAT!  through his choices.   he decided that spending his life with me was more impt than continuing to live the way he had for so long.   making excuses.   he's lost 30 pounds since January,  and we'll lose the remainder over the next year or so.  Oh!  he's off all oral diabetes meds and HTN meds.  nifty how the body reacts to a TRULY healthy weight."

fatlogic,eoo958w,t1_eoo2mw1,1558732683.0,"make sure your meals have cho, protein,  and fats in the correct amt (for you!).  eat slowly.   pay attn to what you are eating.   wait 20 minutes after you finish eating.   if you're still hungry, do better at the next meal.  the people I have worked with do best with a 40/30/30 ratio of cho/protein/ fat, staying hydrated,  basic exercise and realizing that being hungry isnt a bad thing ;)  If you stay up later than usual,  your brain might ask for cho because you are requiring it to use glucose, BUT, that doesnt mean your pancreas or metabolism NEEDS to eat."
