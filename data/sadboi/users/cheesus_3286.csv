AmItheAsshole,foz7p62,t3_g9vlsd,1588186067.0,"Assuming this is not a troll (which I really do not think it is. Maybe I'm biased because I type like that sometimes. But who knows) you're NTA by any means. Relationships require you to laugh at the other person's (light) suffering. The fact that she would get upset and teary-eyed while in a vulnerable state is understandable but still not talking to you a day later is insane. 

Also it seems like everyone commenting has never been in a committed relationship before. I know that if I saw that, I'm sure I'd have a chuckle, and while my own girlfriend could take it the wrong way, she'd be able to laugh at herself the next day. I'm baffled at how anyone thinks to be in a relationship you must never offend your partner

Edit: was wondering why I couldn't find the N T A or N A H explanations and it's because they've been downvoted to oblivion which against the rules of this sub. Seriously?"

SuicideWatch,fo3xugc,t3_g5ejp3,1587494788.0,"Look, I understand the situation you're talking about, I've been in the same position, but nevertheless you have no right to be upset at people who are trying to help you. Of course they won't offer key advice that will help you in an instant, but I know that's not what you want. But when people ask you to explain to them how you're feeling, it means they really care about you, your situation, and what you have to say. 

I know there are a select few, who are not truly friends mind you, who will ghost you or something after learning what's going on but you have to know those are a minority of the people who care about you. The lines ""I don't know what to say"" and ""see a therapist"" do not help you in the moment and could make you feel worse, but that display of care and support is invaluable in the long run.

My friend, please do not kill yourself (the quarantine won't be even close to over anyway and your family couldn't have a funeral for you). You should see someone to talk to - a professional. You might not like to vent, but these people have been training for decades to help people just like that. You have a chance to stay alive, and I think you should do it."
