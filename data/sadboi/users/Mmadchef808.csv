I think the only approved treatment with ketamine is Spravado. The intranasal one. Look into that . Won’t hurt and it’s a nice monitored out of body experience for a couple hours. 👍

Had to go under anesthesia for ECT and that alone was frightening and traumatic. The paralytic they gave left me awake and u able to talk or scream one session.

Did ketamine a year after that . First administered IV in hospital twice a week for 6 weeks. No improvement. 

Did intranasal ketamine twice a week for 6 weeks a year later. No improvement. Have depression and suicidal ideations still. Been inpatient after all this too. 
Needless to say doesn’t work for everyone. 
Wouldn’t hurt to try.

ECT is the “ gold standard” but for me it was barbaric and scary. Maybe it was the dr I had too 🤷‍♀️"

I’m isolating under my blanket, can’t breathe, heart rate way up, insomnia, and exhausted mentally. I did this today, learned in BPD to ask if these feelings are founded. I’d say yes haha. What you are feeling is ok. You’re not wrong, worthless, or deserving of anything bad. A thought is just a thought. It’s what you do that matters. I self harm to cope and yes that’s not healthy but it what’s I know. Just like people who do drugs. Now theresradical acceptance. That things are what they are and it is what it is. We will just adjust and handle each situation as it comes up. Honestly, I’ve thought if I get sick , I get sick. Of course I gonna do all the recommended things for virus protection but I’ve accepted what will or may happen . But hopefully we’ll all be ok haha."

I was the class slut. All my ways I realize now because of wanting love and attention to make me feel good. I’ve had some very difficult years, rape, suicidal events, self harm, short lived relationships, and heavy drug use. I’ve gotten thru all that , I mean I’m still here but still having to deal with the disease. Knowing that what it was is how I know how to handle things better by going to DBT classes, a psychologist every week. And a psychiatrist once a month. For the last 4 years. Don’t get me wrong I still freak out, cut, scream, and have dark thoughts constantly but I acknowledge them then move on. May be the next hour or day but it happens again and again. Your thoughts aren’t bad or wrong, theyre how you feel. It’s ok. You’re young and I won’t sugar coat it , it’s a long hard road. But hopefully things will happen that will bring you help and most important as it was for me finding my Husband who I’ve been with for 25 years and has put up with all my disasters.  Take care."
