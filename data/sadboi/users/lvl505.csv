depressed,fpiyl1p,t3_gdnnxh,1588651846.0,"please don't isolate yourself. I know so well how it feels and why it feels right to do so. the people you have around you don't seem to give a shit about any of what you're feeling even if you were to scream it in their faces. isolation seems like it would be better than actually going through the pain of trying to make people care or looking for people that do. it feels comforting once you silence all of that noise and you're just left with yourself. but please trust that this will hurt you so much and that silence will soon turn against you. 

I'm going through one of the most difficult things in my life right now. today someone I loved parted ways with me. I've sacrificed my entire being for this person to the point where I've isolated myself from the handful of (be it, not really that stellar) friends I had. I have no one right now. i have no one to vent to, to trust or to listen. I'm fucking alone and I want to die. if I wasnt so stupid I wouldnt be bawling my eyes out alone, I'd be bawling  my eyes out with a support system. but I don't have that, because I did the same thing.

If you are to distance yourself from those who hurt you, start by making new connections with others first. PLEASE don't settle in solitude. I made the same mistake my entire life. I say this out of worry, care and regret over my own situation. isolation is the worst form of therapy."

From my experience, the thought  have never went away however the impulsiveness of doing so and hurting myself did.  I still have moments of despair but I tend to think more rationally about it instead of doing something I'm gonna regret. 
This being said, I believe it is different for everyone. For example, before this, I was on Lexapro and it made me extremely unstable, agressive and fatigued. while for me it made me this way, for some people it works wonders so it is all about trial and error with anti depressants. Just never give up on treatment (be it medication or other methods) and stay aware of changes. (tracking them down in a journal helps, no matter how minimal)"

Yet they don't give two shits if they make you cry, and here you are worried if they're bothered by anything. It's so frustrating living this way.

I get where you're coming from, I believe you should take the time to process it by yourself first and then have a calm talk with your husband and explain why it made you upset and ask for him to refrain from such jokes, as it triggers a negative feeling on you. when someone loves and cares for your well being they will understand and apologize, and I'm positive it's just a matter of letting him know and remember your true feelings about it. hope it goes well."
