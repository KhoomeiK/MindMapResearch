After I realized bringing up uncomplimentary things about the church only puts a TBM on the defense and cements their beliefs further, I just stopped bringing up church topics altogether- it may have been some advice from the sub from someone a few years ago. Anyway I wanted my marriage to work so the next thing I just worked on being the best wife ever- meaning I did anything I could to spark husbands love language. (Back rubs, compliments, avoiding triggers that resulted in arguments,  etc) one could argue I was being a bit inauthentic, but it felt nice to make hubby happy. It wasn‚Äôt too long before he started asking me  about my beliefs and church stuff. I kept responses vague and referred him to different sources or podcasts since I knew they could explain things better than I could.
