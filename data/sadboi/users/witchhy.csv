i met him on reddit, this very same subreddit actually. No he’s not diagnosed with BPD. I fell head over heels for him, crazy obsessed to the point where he convinced me to buy a plane ticket after knowing him THREE FUCKING WEEKS. And the kicker is he told me i shouldn’t get insurance unless i was planning to cancel. omfg. and of course a week later this little nutterbutter tried to leave for another girl. yeah. I remember being so sad. like full on crying and some self harm. “BuT hE’s My TwIn FlAmE!” 

It ended up working out long enough for me to go see him like 2 months later and the trip was fun at least, New England is beautiful even in December and he was okay i guess, so it wasn’t that bad, i went home with a Narwhal plushie too. and he didn’t murder me and dump my body in the harbour either, so that’s a massive plus. 

just the crazy thing is he’s not even special. like now after surviving that whole endeavour i know there’s literally nothing that sets him apart from my other shitty exes aside from living 600 miles away in *magical new england* and he couldn’t get on my nerves as much or punch me

he also made little jabs at me constantly. calling me stupid and what have you. he almost never really said anything nice to me but every other girl was pretty to him. he made sure i knew that what he didn’t like about me and what he’d change about me.

i really told myself that i love him and this isn’t too much for me to handle even though he made me so miserable that i wasn’t even eating when i was supposed to be i’m anorexia recovery. i really wanted it to work while i was just sad and beaten down.

he did the kind thing and he left me alone, after many false abandonments. by the end i was daring him to leave whenever he started off about “i don’t think this is going to work” so he’s gone now and i pray for the next mentally ill girl he sinks his hooks into. apparently he likes when they’re mentally ill but he doesn’t want to deal with the negative things that come with it.

but relationships became added to the mix, they were very obsessive and had a weird vibe, i was way too attached and very jealous

so my longest relationship, we actually lived together. umm, my reactions to the things he did weren’t normal. they were nuts and that’s not to say he was a good partner, he was the human equivalent to finding a used condom at the park if i’m being honest but i shouldn’t have swallowed pills because he was acting like a wank stain towards me. he just made me crazy and i could tell you horrifying stories. but that relationship caused my diagnosis. i was ready to jump off a fucking overpass every other day living with him so it lead to hospitalizations and me having to talking to a psychiatrist a lot.

when you think of him in a nice way i suggest you talk about these fights, how they make him feel, it won’t feel good mind you, but maybe he’ll tell you his least favourite part so you can use that as your sort of stop sign. to realize youre possibility out of control and you need to take a moment to think and breathe and possibly let the argument go or maybe approach it with a cooler head. like i said over time i believe practicing this will help your relationship and along the way you’ll find other ways calm down as well

BPD,fnidig8,t1_fnib259,1586978160.0,"my ex actually used to say “we’re breaking up” whenever i would get upset and it would put me through the worst pain imaginable. i think the saddest thing is he knew that him abandoning me has made me self harm in the past and the abruptness of it often made me feel suicidal and he still did it and he kept doing it until he left for real.

if this becomes a pattern i really think you should leave. i believe it is a narc trait. “Look how easily i can leave you and ignore you, you better smarten up.”

BPD,fngk9u3,t3_g1kwys,1586934940.0,"so for me i’m way too trusting, so in every new relationship i won’t have the fears unless there’s an argument and they go radio silent. other than that i feel totally safe.

a unique case is my ex actually abandoning me multiple times, a lot of times.

i guess my advice is find the right ones. if they try to leave you for another girl early on and then tell you that you never don’t cared about them, well that’s a red flag served on a silver platter and promptly run in the opposite direction. yiiiiikes

but just try to just breathe, separate rational thought from irrational before acting."
