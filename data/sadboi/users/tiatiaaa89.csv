It’s honestly pretty simple. It sounds like it bothers you that you have it, and she doesn’t. And that’s okay if it is, learning to recognize that is an important therapy tool to revert the line of thinking into what would be considered “normal” I hate that word though. 


At the end of the day the only thing you have control over is yourself. And this is part of the healing, learning to either confront or dismiss things of varying importance. Not everything is worth getting annoyed over, and not everyone is going to put you first in a thought. People are somewhat selfish and forgetful when they have their own things going on. It would make you a better friend to communicate that with them in a non aggressive way if it bothered you. But you have to expect a number of responses.

People without mental heath issues are more successful in this naturally than we are, expecting someone to remember your mental illness offends you if it’s a comment, is just not something I think someone can do 100% of the time."

I mean, we do actually have the ability to choose to ignore it right? And that’s what beating and coping with OCD is about, having control of yourself in every capacity. 

That said, I totally get that’s a lot easier said than done. Everyone has had their own struggle, battle, and I’m not dismissing that.

But I don’t care if someone without OCD doesn’t have it, I think I would be happy that they don’t have to suffer like I did for 30 years before I got help. I got help, that’s all I really wanted anyway. 

Anyway that’s just my opinion, quarantine has so much time for self reflection. Ive learned that we can stop perpetuating stereotypes, and we can choose not to care if we wanted to."
