AskReddit,fp16t0e,t1_fozpt7g,1588226027.0,"When I was 11-12 year old I used to wish to have mental illness thanks to romanticizing. Now I’m 20 and have been struggeling with depression, anxiety and some kind of eating disorder for years now. 
Quite often I think about how stupid I was for wanting it. It is not pretty or romantic, it is scary and destroys you. It will break friendships and there is no one to blame but your illness."

unpopularopinion,fnrohkm,t3_g3appc,1587195743.0,"It’s rape when a person is too drunk to propely function then they are not able to consent. But when a person is tipsy or a little drunk but still is able to function as a normal person aka walks guite normally and acts normal then I do not think its rape. Also when both persons are literally shitfaced and are having sex, then noone cant be held accountable because neither of them were able to consent which makes them both rapist and also a victim."

depression,fhuafr9,t3_f4uo5w,1581884044.0,"It is basically the same as the mental hospidals in my country. With free healthcare I can be there basically as long the doctors see me fit to leave. Phone gets taken away, you see doctors frequently and ofcourse, get to eat, In some hospitals there are music rooms for music therapy and gym maybe too. I am not 100% sure how the life is there or what opportunities I have there, but I’ll be going there in April, so I’ll soon find out."

This is rough situation. How does she get along with her family? Do they know abiut her deep depression and what do they think?"
SuicideWatch,fgfaqa6,t3_ey2eou,1580732608.0,"If antidepressants make her feel numb, they are probably wrong for her. She should try another type. But this can only happen if she is willing to try get help again. It takes time I know. 
But be with her the whole day, do things she likes to do, eat her favourite food and watch something together while you cuddle. 
I wish her a lot of strenght and I am sure she has it her to try again to get help.
And ofcourse do not be afraid to let authorities know if thing take a very bad turn."

Anyways as another redditor said it is not your last christmas with your family. You have next year and more years to come to celebrate.
As I deal with my crippling depression I understand what you and your friend might be going trough. In a time like this your friend needs you more than your family does since they are not alone in the hospital. I am so sorry that your family does not understand what you both are going trough. 
Let your friend know that you deeply care about them and will not leave them. 

Ps! English is not mu first language so I do apologise for any mistakes."

I am suprised that you still want get along with this man after he hurt you and your mom. 
Nice revenge tho."
AskReddit,f1nmv4p,t3_da0wc1,1569620874.0,I work at a clothing retail where high-level costumer service is a must. Also it is a male clothing shop. So basically a guy was looking for jeans and I assisted him. Found some pairs he wanted to try and gave them to him. Once he was walking towards the fitting room I told him goodbye and to have a nice day.
BreakUps,f1h496i,t1_f1gqv23,1569485174.0,"Because I am still attatched to him and it is not like I have lost feelings for him, I am just not sure if it is the right thing to stay together. Maybe I am totally overthinking but maybe I am right. 
I love him but I am not sure if I see our future together anymore. It takes probably months to finally find the strenght to get over him and break things up."
BreakUps,f1ffrsi,t3_d972u9,1569443542.0,"Since the talk over my depression and how my negative toughts affected my boyfriend and how he thinks we are too different and we may not have future together, I’m scared. We did talk and things got better but I am afraid to talk about my depression and show my feelings. Sometimes when we joke about breaking up or about finding someone better, I’m so very scared that he really might wanna break up with me. I cant even bare the tought of it. I imagined my future with him. Without him I would be dead or in the other side of the world. 
So I have been lurking here and trying to get over him and finding the streght ans bravery to break up with him before he does it and I get hurt. 
He is quite a cold person with a mindset that “life goes on” and so on, so as I know him that the breakup wouldnt affect nearly as much as it does me."
relationship_advice,expn1fd,t3_ctzkar,1566492137.0,"Leave. Pack your bags and go. Destruction of others property is an abuse. This man is a psycho and he will do something even more terrible if you won’t “respect him” aka submit to him.

Please leave and definitely do not forgive him. This might let him try to manipulate you to go back to him."

relationship_advice,eud3kjl,t3_cfu2o3,1563699450.0,"Pack your bags while he is not at home and leave fast as possible. File divorce paper and leave that man. This is huge red flag and you can not overlook it. He does not care for you as his wife or as a person at all. Do not listen to people who tell you to go back to him. Don’t. He will cheat again, he will manipulate and he will be abusive in some kind of way. 
Find yourself therapist to help you to deal with all of this that happened to you and try to move on.
I am so sorry that happened to you, but now is time to leave and go to somewhere else. Crash at your parents house or at friends house and tell them not to let your (soon to be ex)husband in."
sex,ep7yowj,t3_bu72m9,1559088005.0,"Who you refer to as “whore”? A girl/woman who have had quite many sexual partner before you? A person who is known to be an “easy-catch” or straight up prostitute who is paid for sex? 

Yeah sure, your first time might not have been magical or/and with a person you really care about but this does not really tell anything about your sexual life. 

You definetely are embarrased about it but I do not see a reason why you should be. In the end virginity is nothing but a first time sex with someone you probably will not remember in 10 years unless you are lucky enough to have this person be with you until death seperates you."
sex,ep7vgnl,t3_bu12aq,1559086848.0,"I am terribly sorry for saying this but to me it does not even sound like sex, more like he is just using your body for his own needs. Like he even does not care about that you are uncomfortable on top. There are so many red flags. If months ago he was ready to satisfy you and now he is not, then think what will your future hold. He will stop being such a good guy as he is now, emotional abuse, manipulating will not only be part of the fights about sex but your whole life with him.
He may be a good guy as a friend, but on intimate level he is using you and he is not mature enough to discuss the problem. 
He may care about you as a friend, but he does not as a lover. 
Please do yourself a favor and leave him. You will find someone much more caring in any way."
