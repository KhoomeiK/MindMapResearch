Anxiety,foe5ons,t3_fj2y1a,1587696540.0,"Hi all.

I'll be fasting for a month starting tomorrow.  This year, I've made the personal decision to ""deactivate"" from all things COVID.  Unfortunately, that includes this thread.

It's been **so** helpful, but I also recognize that I have a tendency to check it multiple times a day, especially when I should be focusing on work, etc.  Some days are better than others, but I'm going to challenge myself and try to avoid it entirely for the next month.  It's going to be difficult... honestly probably more difficult than the food/water aspect.  If you see me back here before May 23, I must've encountered a wild Doomer and needed ammo to defeat it. :)

I'm also trying to recognize that at this point, no amount of good (or bad) news will change what I have control of in my own life.  I hope to return back and check in late May... hopefully by then we'll see countries have gradually reopened, life returning to normal, more successful vaccine and treatment trials, high antibody % results, etc.  Regardless, one thing is for sure: **what will be, will be**.  I hope everyone here stays safe, and most importantly, sane.

u/Anistmows \- thank you for this thread, and for everything.  You've helped more people than you could ever know.  I hope you are doing OK.  u/BaconFace2736 \-  thank you for starting the initial thread two months (??) ago, for searching through all of the doom and gloom early on and finding the positive and rational... you saved so many from spiraling.  To all the others that keep this thread going, u/glitzvillechamp, u/algoredumbledore (I'll miss your update tomorrow), u/Vadermaulkylo, u/SimpalleoMan (""grazi-aye""), **thank you**.  I wish you all the best!"

Peaks are occurring all over the US as we speak.  Governors are making decisions on how to reopen.  Hospitals aren't overwhelmed.  Some countries never even closed, and they aren't burning to the ground or dealing with collapsed health care systems.  This virus has most likely been spreading throughout the world for months and months -- it was only when the media started creating panic is when things really started to hit the fan.  

I don't know your personal situation but I know that it's very hard to stay positive when you're surrounded by all of this negative virus stuff, but try to find the silver linings.  Life really is too short to not find the positive...

That + the stories from California lead me to believe that if the panic had never happened, almost all of the hospital stress could have been avoided.  If you look at Sweden, a country that has not locked down but instead just put some common sense hygiene measures in place, they haven't seen their hospitals collapse or a huge stress on the medical systems.

The temporary medical facility previously targeted to open Saturday at the Colorado Convention Center won‚Äôt be ready until the middle of next month and fewer beds will be needed, according to Denver officials and city documents.

The shift in opening dates is due to a mix of construction delays and a diminishing need, Public Health Director Bob McDonald said during a meeting Thursday.

If you implemented these lockdowns with no virus threat, you would have the same exact problem.

Take a regular dice.  Six sides.  Say that prior to the lockdown/quarantine, three of the sides were ""away from the house"" and three of the sides were ""at home"".  Let's say Death rolled the dice each time, and for normal mortality purposes (thousands of people die every day on average), there was a 50/50 chance of someone dying at home versus dying outside of the home.

Now let's play the quarantine version of this Death dice game.  The dice now has 5 sides ""at home"", and only one side ""away from the house"".  Odds are, several people that wouldn't be dying at home during a normal day are now **at home** while dying.  This, coupled with the fact that people are simply scared to go to hospitals, doctors, for fear of catching the virus, could also lead to higher numbers of deaths at home.  This dice might be 6 sides ""at home"" in some cases.  I'm not saying that some of these deaths might be COVID related, but common sense would say that of course there's going to be a spike in people dying at home."

In **ITALY of all places**, bookstores, stationary stores, baby clothing and supply stores were allowed to open yesterday.  So these talks about social distancing even lasting through the fall seem ridiculous to me.  You can't simply continue to have a functioning society if you do this.  This would only lead us to a police/surveillance state or mass economic collapse.

Anxiety,fnahhaf,t1_fnaevqj,1586797587.0,"From Worldometers ( [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/)), total % of severe cases is 4% at the moment.  During the early stages of this outbreak, in China specifically, this number was as high as 20%, but as more and more testing occurred, this number dropped and dropped.  **Mild now at 96%.**  Granted, this might not be an exact reporting, but it has moved in the right direction during this entire outbreak.  

Regarding the ""official"" number being skewed, you have to keep in mind that a lot of people have never been tested because 1) they had it but were completely asymptomatic and never knew they had it, 2) they had a ""weird cold"" or just thought they had the flu, or 3) they weren't able to get tested due to certain restrictions on testing capacity in several U.S. states and other countries (only those showing symptoms were tested).  Given that information, the only logical conclusion is that the number of mild infected is understated by several magnitudes.  For additional discussion, here's a study from Denmark:

S*o far 57,535 people in Denmark have been tested for coronavirus. 5,386 have been tested positive.*

*The Danish Serum Institute has always counted on a considerable number of dark figures and yesterday estimated that the actual number of infected persons could be somewhere between 70,000 and 150,000.*

I know that they *look* necessary from how the news/governments are portraying things, and I'm not saying the lockdowns/quarantines don't help -- of course they do, because less people to spread to -- but did the overloading of hospitals happen because of the virus, or was it because of the media-induced panic *about* the virus?  If California didn't fall apart or have bodies piling in the street for the last 3 months prior to their lockdown, it seems to me that the fear/panic that's been attached to this virus by social/mainstream media has essentially made it deadlier."
Anxiety,fn8n6iv,t1_fn8kwt7,1586745522.0,"There's a lot going on with your post.  Just a couple random points:

1. More than 95% of cases are mild.  This might be more like 99% cases mild, because out of the ""official"" number, there are probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of untested people that had it and were either asymptomatic or just thought it was a cold/flu.
2. Young people pass away from the flu.  Here's an article -- [https://www.today.com/health/teen-athlete-dies-flu-it-can-happen-anyone-t108040](https://www.today.com/health/teen-athlete-dies-flu-it-can-happen-anyone-t108040)  \-- would this article make you panic if you replaced the word ""flu"" with ""COVID""?  The media is simply highlighting the rare extremes, just like they do with plane crashes.  Plane crashes are statistically rare, but any time one happens, it's broadcast on all networks for days.  Do they do that with car crashes, which are statistically the more common occurrence?  Remember: **if it bleeds, it leads**.  They'll rather report the healthy young person passing away rather than the 103-year old that recovered.
3. There is SUCH a high chance of survival.  Here's a preprint article by John Ioannidis (Stanford professor of medicine).   [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361v1).  Now I wouldn't take this as fact, but it's just a different perspective on the risk.  He concludes that the risk of death for people under 65 years of age, even in global hotspots, is equivalent to the risk of a fatal car accident for daily commuters driving between 9 and 400 miles.  Is your daily commute between that mileage range?  If so, **statistically**, you should worry as much about dying from COVID as you do dying from your daily commute.  I assume this worry would equate to near zero."

At that point, wouldn't these ""restrictions"" be unnecessary, as we put them in place because it was done under assumptions that this virus was much worse than that?  I don't like to say it, but I feel that a great deal of the stress/overload that hospitals saw was because of all the panic and fear that had been spreading for weeks on social media and then moved into the spotlight of the mainstream media.  People who would have originally just hung out at home ""feeling under the weather"" were now going to the hospital to get tested, increasing needed resources.  Healthcare workers that tested positive but had no symptoms were forced to quarantine for 2 weeks, creating more stress and work load for the others.  All of this stress and anxiety caused by the media focus can hurt the immune system, which is the first line of defense against this virus.  If that defense is weakened, more severe complications can happen.

I say all of this hypothetically, if the antibody tests come out like they have in smaller studies.  Not advocating **not** social distancing, just questioning these measures long term as we find out more and more about this virus."

Additionally, the news is going to focus on the extreme negative versus the extreme positive.  A story about the 100+ year old with underlying conditions that **recovered** isn't going to get the same airtime as the negative story.

1. First off, I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this type of 'pandemic' during a pregnancy.  I can only imagine how stressful it must be at times, but please (for your health and the babies health) try to find ways to avoid stressful articles like this, as it will only hurt your body.  Try to find some ways to combat the stress and block out the negative extremes that get reported in the news.  Prenatal yoga via the internet?  Going for walks outside?  As a first time dad of a now 3 month old, and I was already on edge with the flu season back in January.  The whole Iranian thing in early January caused me to spiral... here I was thinking ""my wife and I just brought a baby into a world that's about to be blown up by stupid politics"".  Thankfully everything has been fine, but it does provide additional anxiety to everyday life.  I've learned to deal with it and avoid focusing on things outside of my control.  Makes life much more enjoyable, especially when I can now focus on the baby rather than my anxiety.  
2. The article is counting that death as a COVID death.  I very much disagree.  **The baby did not have COVID.**  The baby was born at 22 weeks premature, which is almost never survivable.
3. The article does not go into detail on the health of the mother, so there's no way to tell if she was in a higher risk pregnancy category, or if she had underlying issues, etc -- how convenient, right?  This article is meant to scare, not inform.  I don't think this article changes anything about the overall virus situation.  As a pregnant woman, you should certainly take more precaution, but that goes for any virus!  If you get the flu during pregnancy, you're more likely than other adults to have serious complications.  That's why the flu shot is so important.  Unfortunately, we don't have a ""COVID shot"", but as long as you are washing your hands and avoiding crowded places, you should be fine.  Honestly, the best thing for you is to avoid unnecessary stress, and I've found the best way to do so is to avoid the news (aside from local/county updates that personally affect you) and to focus on things within your control.  

Although nothing in life is guaranteed, I am sure you will be fine, and I wish you the best with the rest of your pregnancy.  Please stay strong.  Please get some sunlight, when possible -- vitamin D does wonders.  üòä"

Also keep in mind that a lot of reported ""COVID deaths"" have not actually been autopsied to see if COVID was the cause, or if it was simply present in the body at the time of death. 

Just try to breathe and don't focus on ONE particular case."
Anxiety,fmmivzj,t1_fmmi3q0,1586206083.0,"It's not an exponential curve.  If you look at it in terms of total tests being performed, the # of POSITIVE tests out of TOTAL tests is barely increasing.  That is **not** exponential.  Don't let the media throw that word around because they're simply using it to scare, not inform."
Anxiety,fmmiqfh,t1_fmmgozj,1586206001.0,"Let's play under the assumption that we're locked down for the next 4 months.

What would you do at home to pass the time?  Any projects that you need to accomplish?  What about puzzles?  Maybe some type of outdoor project?  Build something?  Create something?  Video games?  Music?  Think about some goals that you could work toward *IF* you're locked down for 4 months.  In the grand scheme of things, a 4 month period is like 0.5% of our entire lives, if not less.  This too shall pass.  Try to spend the time doing things you enjoy rather than focusing on things you might not be able to currently do because of the lockdown."

Anxiety,fmmhy91,t1_fmmgjxi,1586205592.0,"These are just my personal thoughts, but wasn't the peak of the virus weeks ago, if not a month ago, when it was spreading like crazy but we weren't really testing for it?  Is it not safer now to go get groceries than it was weeks ago when people were jamming into the toilet paper section of Costco without any 6 ft separation or social distance guidance?  I for one feel more comfortable going out now than I did in February and early March when people weren't paying much attention to it.  Yes, we may be reaching a peak of *testing results* for the virus, but in terms of virus spread, is it not spreading slower now than ever before?  I'd feel the odds of catching it in public today are exponentially lower than they were two to three weeks ago."
Anxiety,fmcl9cx,t1_fmcaqpj,1585947835.0,Thank you for sticking with this thread since Day 1.  We all appreciate it.  It's helped so many come out of the dark places regarding this virus.  I hope you are doing well.
Anxiety,fmbvitu,t1_fmbo7tq,1585933988.0,"I understand, it's hard not to be curious about something like this.  But if that were true, there would be a HELL of a lot more people infected.  There would be hundreds of thousands of infected people just from flights in January/February alone.  But there aren't.  I don't remember the study and I don't have time to dig it up right now, but the risk of ""walking past an infected individual in a hallway"" is basically zero risk.  Jogging past someone would be even lower than ""basically zero"".  So I'm not sure if it's necessary ""conflicting"" information, but rather ""misinformation""."
Anxiety,fmbmfbz,t1_fmbkaem,1585929211.0,Congrats :) the little victories.
Anxiety,fmbm9n8,t1_fmblpwa,1585929126.0,"""Stay at home"" simply means don't go to public places unless you need something essential.  Like don't go grocery shopping every day.  Don't run to Wal-Mart because you want new pants.  Anything you can buy online, do so instead.  But that's simply to avoid people congregating in spaces, and to cut down on overloading the workers that are out there in the stores, etc.  

Going for a walk, bike ride, exercise, etc. is fine.  The virus is not floating around in the air outside."
Anxiety,fmb9vj9,t1_fmb6hvx,1585921925.0,"Do you have a specific source or article stating that?  Just curious -- would like to pass that information along, as I suspect you are correct."
Anxiety,fmb4pvp,t1_fmaqa9i,1585918263.0,"They're doing this in Italy too.  Someone can pass away of 100% heart disease, but if they tested positive for COVID, they're counted as a COVID death, regardless of symptoms or not.  Once I heard this, it completely changed how I'm looking at the ""rising death toll"" as it appears a lot of the deaths are just normal, daily deaths being included in COVID deaths because of the presence of the virus.

*‚ÄúThe way in which we code deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all the people who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the coronavirus.*

*On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity - many had two or three,‚Äù he says.*¬†

I am curious if the U.S. numbers are totaled the same way.  It will be interesting to see how much ""excess mortality"" comes out of this pandemic (AKA how many *extra* people died in 2020 versus the average annual worldwide deaths)."
