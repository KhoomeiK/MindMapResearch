modafinil,fnflbzy,t3_g1510a,1586910326.0,"Moda is the best shit to manage depression. It will give energy, focus and motivation to get your things done. Depression is really really really manageable while you're on Moda. I take one antidepressant which Wellbutrin. You may ask your doc. for this. This is the only antidepressant has been working so far. I tried 6-7 antidepressant. Nothing worked."
modafinil,fnbwpkw,t1_fn8gexn,1586823831.0,It took me two years to get the perfect combo. I have had tried 14 medications so far. Now currently taking 5 meds a day.
modafinil,fnbwjgn,t1_fn8gexn,1586823733.0,I am also Bipolar 2 with ADHD. If you're struggling with depression then I believe modafinil would help you to a great extent. It really helps to manage depression. Depression would be really manageable while you're on modafinil.
modafinil,fn0qtkw,t1_fmcczy1,1586546993.0,"Yeah, it's an amazing combo. I didn't mention about Wellbutrin and I take this too. I take Lamotrigine, Vyvanse, Modafinil, Wellbutrin, Risperidone. Since last month, I am without depression after three years. I am not manic. I am stable now. Wellbutrin helps to reduce ADHD symptoms. My hyperactivity doesn't exist anymore. Sometimes a little bit of hyperactivity shows up, but it's manageable. I take Lamotrigine 150 mg, one in the morning and one at night. Modafinil would be better than Adderall if it makes you feel exhausted. In the end, it depends on our body. Give it a time to reduced dosage of Lamotrigine. I had cognitive issues too. I took 200 mg twice a day. Then I cut down to 100 mg twice a day and then titrated up to 150 mg twice a day. When your body will be adjusted to it, you won't have any cognitive issues anymore. May I ask why do you take these meds, if you don't mind?"

modafinil,fk2r27u,t3_fg47un,1583807189.0,"Man take these two together. Your life will be changed. Have Bipolar 2 Disorder and ADHD. Tried 7 antidepressants so far and Wellbutrin is the best and it alleviated my depression. And modafinil as well. Got rid of brain fog, fatigue, tiredness and excessive sleep. Have made me stable like heavenly feeling in heaven now. You can manage your shit effectively and these two will make it easier and manageable."
modafinil,fjltkpt,t1_fjlsxzp,1583454140.0,"Oh! I was trying to say that since modafinil is a strong stimulant, it might trigger mania. So, I was trying to tell you be cautious about it. Monitor your moods while on modafinil."
modafinil,fjlmv5k,t1_fjlhdha,1583449824.0,Be careful about your manic symptoms. Otherwise you'll be good I believe. It gets easy to manage Bipolar while on modafinil.
afinil,fjlmp65,t1_fjlildw,1583449720.0,No vyvanse and modafinil we are talking about
afinil,fjlmnri,t1_fjljehe,1583449695.0,I agree with you.
modafinil,fjlddcn,t1_fjlay5q,1583444681.0,"Hey buddy, glad to know that you're also a bipolar like me. ðŸ¤Ÿ. I have moved to Canada in 2017 for Undergrad study. Since then my severe symptoms showed up. Got diagnosed with bipolar 2 and ADHD in 2018. Have been taking meds, going to therapy, abused prescription pills, psychedelic drugs. Lost everything in my life. Failing terribly in school. Changed my major. Lost my life long desire and dream to study in computer science. Got fucked up financially big time. Thousands of dollars of credit card debts. That fucking Hypomania and depression ruined everything. Our brain is a bad neighborhood. One half of it wants us to win and the other half wants us destroyed. We are stuck between them. I started with 100 and have been on 100 till now. Am on vyvanse too. So, don't want to increase the dosage . Too much stimulant can trigger mania."
afinil,fjlajyj,t3_fdwvhy,1583443100.0,"If you have ADHD, don't replace Adderall with modafinil. They're different from each other. Modafinil will make you alert, like hell. But not giving you the ability to harness the power. You will feel active on it. No tiredness in your body. But since you have ADHD, you won't be able to focus enough on your task if you're simply on modafinil. If you take both, then whoa! That combo is really good. I take vyvanse 60 mg and modafinil 100mg both in the morning. I have been on Vyvanse for two years. When I was prescribed modafinil, I didn't take vyvanse for a month. I saw my ADHD symptoms rising. Then started taking two at the same time, and now ADHD is under control. By the way, I take modafinil as an adjunct medication to my Bipolar disorder treatment."
modafinil,fjl9le5,t3_fe0u7k,1583442569.0,"Hey there, I have been taking modafinil for two months. I have Bipolar 2 Disorder and ADHD. I had serious lethargic issues. Had brain fog, tiredness in my entire body. most of time sleepy during the day. Was going late for work. Missed classes and failed. I researched on it and found modafinil as a result. Did a rigorous research on how could it benefit someone with bipolar disorder. Asked my psychiatrist and family physician for two months. Then finally gave the modafinil in early January.

The first day I took it, my goodness, i still remember that feeling. My two years of feeling foggy just gone after 30 minutes taking it. Have been productive than ever on it. It made me unsocial in a way. At first, I was being unsocial because of bipolar depression. Then I knew that modafinil would help me with that and it did. But slowly it made me focus on my tasks more than anything in my life. I couldn't sit still. I needed to get things done, no matter what. I got scared and then finally feeling scared of getting alone tapered down slowly. I can socialize if I want, but I just enjoy my own company better than being with anybody. Modafinil made sure that.

I found my memory improved. Have had cognitive deficit because of severe Depression. I am working better at my workplace. Going to classes. Sleep habit improved. 

But my creative thinking ability kind of locked in.kind of feel like it's trying to get out of something whenever I am trying to think creatively, and I don't feel good at that moment. This feeling can't be described in words. Just imagine that your creative self is locked within a cell and it can't do anything because it's locked in a cell and whenever you're trying to think it's trying to move and get out of that cell, and you can feel it. It's just like I stop myself when trying to think out of the box, because it doesn't feel good. I feel a tightened stress in my head in that moment. This is the worst side effect I faced.
Otherwise have had no side effects. Modafinil has made my life wonderful. I asked my doctor and he gave me. Told and showed him the empirical and anecdotal evidence that it's been helping people with bipolar Disorder. People say that it's a godsend to them. I would say the same. I am not a lazy guy, but bipolar made me so. Modafinil working against that, and making me hard working bloke."

 You may figure out if you're overthinking or moving one project to another project. If you want to do something in your life suppose you want to pursue your career in one field but you also interested in other fields, and it  keep thinking of changing your interest of field you wanna pursue then you know what it is. 

This one happens to me all the time. That when i know it's hypomania."

BipolarReddit,exkts8v,t3_ctg7xf,1566398764.0,"Lithium is the best. But you have to maintain a lot of things while taking these. Certain diets, blood pressure and alcohol intake etc. 

See an another doctor cause she doesn't know about this stuff. It is believed that someone with mental disorder should at least see 3 doctors.

 I have been misdiagnosed with OCD at first. Then after coming here in Canada, 

I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II, Possibly ADHD, Borderline Personality Traits and Dependent Personality Traits. 

I have one physician, one Psychiatrist and one counselor. Hope it helps."
