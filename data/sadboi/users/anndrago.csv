news,eyzurgf,t1_eyzewqp,1567625178.0,"No doubt, there's a lot of medical misinformation. Unfortunately, misinformation can easily come from (and often does come from) burned out or under-educated MDs. Everyone is trying to make a buck and the players in the conventional care system are no exception.

&#x200B;

Conventional care is great for lots of things. If I have a broken bone, a burn, an acute infection, need surgery, or some other kind of acute care issue, I'm totally going to a conventional doc. For my chronic health issues, I go to a functional medicine practitioner. The conventional care model works great for acute care issues, but it's lousy for preventive care and root-cause care. People with complex, chronic issues often go to functional medicine practitioners because they've been to enough conventional care doctors who can't help them or give them treatment that makes them worse (I speak from experience).

&#x200B;

Some troubles with conventional care:

&#x200B;

1. It can take decades for newer research to make it into medical texts so many doctors graduate having not learned some of the most relevant information. For example, unless they specialize, they get virtually no training on nutrition, the colon or the gut. This is unfortunate because a big percentage of the most common problems in the US and Europe have strong correlations with these things. I'm hardpressed to find a doctor who knows much at all about the microbiome and the huge role it plays in the health of the body. My GI specialist knew next to nothing about IBS compared with my FMP. I was amazed and impressed that my 80 yo dermatologist knew psoriasis/eczema/acne aren't skin problems but gut problems. He learned that fact pretty late in the game, but at least he learned it.
2. Typically the only treatments in the conventional perview are those covered by insurance (unless you pay an arm and a leg for the finest care).
3. The only lab tests used are those covered by insurance, so they miss out on cutting edge testing developed by independent labs based on new research (e.g. DUTCH, SIBO, GI-MAP, Organix, etc).
4. Last but not least, the conventional care system deals with the treatment of symptoms, not root cause. Most doctors, unless they go out of their way to do additional research or decide not to make as much money as they could, don't have the time to vet a full patient profile/history in order to find out why someone is having problems. They use drugs to treat the symptoms. Drugs are totally appropriate in many cases, but they often aren't the only answer, nor the most appropriate answer. The vast majority of what plagues modern, developed society (type 2 diabetes, heart disease, IBS, hypertension, etc) can be solved with lifestyle and habit changes.

&#x200B;

Functional medicine is the way to go, imo.

1 in 4 people in the US have a chronic disease, and the modern, conventional care model is not a sustainable solution.

To me, it's worth it for a few reasons. For one, my hair is very picky and medicated shampoo makes it look like crap. Second, medicated shampoo and steroids haven't worked as well for me as the honey. They work a little bit, but I still have plenty of plaques.

The guy thinks that the biker is over reacting, and he's feeling defensive, like,  ""shit, I know I made a mistake but you don't have to rub my nose in it,"" and chooses a dumb way of expressing it (flipping him off).
