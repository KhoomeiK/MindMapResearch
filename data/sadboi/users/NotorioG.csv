If you've ever been to Vancouver you would see that it is about half Chinese, the city of Richmond is more like 80% to the point where they have street signs in Mandarin.

But luck absolutely has an effect, we just tell ourselves it doesn't apply to us.

Trust me I'm not taking it the wrong way, your kindness and logic has no impact on my sense of self.

But in my subjective worldview, this is completely wrong.

The fallacy here is believing that there are tens of thousands of artists out there that believe in themselves enough that they are willing to risk it all. That is not the case.

Most believe in themselves somewhat, so they receive some success that matches their level of trust.  Many don't believe in themselves much at all, they believe more in what the world tells them they should do, and if you spend anytime on Reddit -- you know that narrative is the large majority.

Then, when they don't become huge, they blame luck or something else, they tell the world that they tried and failed, but trust me -- **they did not go all in**, and if they did? They gave up too soon.

If this wasn't such an old post my perspective here would get shredded to bits.
