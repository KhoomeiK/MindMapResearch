Edmonton,fr3ur32,t1_fqtp8n8,1589866830.0,"> The point isn't how small the number is, the point is that Calgary as a whole hasn't been able to get it's numbers as low as Edmonton and most other areas.

The reason for that is mainly due to our Airport. YYC is a much busier airport than YEG. 

Calgary had 17,960,000 passengers in 2019.

Edmonton had 8,151,532 in 2019.


And as one of the country’s major international hubs, YYC remained open to international flights, while YEG was closed to international flights on  [march 16](https://globalnews.ca/news/6683603/edmonton-airport-no-international-flights/)

Calgary had international flights going until they were shut down [april 13](https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/air-canada-and-others-suspend-flights-until-june-as-sector-slammed-by-covid-19-1.4894281)

They are the people that gave us “the rich redneck asshole Albertan” stereotype in other provinces. They literally acted like they were better than you because they worked in O&G.

And then, when many lost their jobs starting in 2015, we all watched as they blamed the AB NDP for a situation out of their control, and constantly spat vitriol towards anyone working for the government. We watched as they complained that because they’re out of work, the government should lay-off healthcare and education workers. How dare they still have a job.
And they’re STILL acting that way 5 years later. That the only jobs that are respectable, and worthwhile are O&G jobs.

Frankly, most of us are just sick of it."
