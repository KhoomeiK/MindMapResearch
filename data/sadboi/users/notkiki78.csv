depression,f51jtpd,t1_f51hi22,1571941693.0,"tbh sometimes i feel like even my
family doesn’t care about me"
depression,f51h69e,t1_f51g01t,1571940924.0,"same, i feel like nobody gives a fuck about me. so in a way, at least if i feel like shit people might care about me? yes i guess that probably means i’m an attention seeker but maybe that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. at least when i’m in my dark times i can talk about it with certain people and they can show that they care about me and stuff but when i feel okay (not happy, just okay) no one cares. it’s like nobody cares unless you’re bad ENOUGH. if that makes sense. idk"
depression,f51fipw,t1_f51d6b6,1571940498.0,but in a weird way I don’t even want to beat depression :/ somehow I’m completely content with living in misery because I don’t really know anything else. So being ‘happy’ (not quite there yet) just feels so scary and weird
depression,f05h70o,t3_d3soyg,1568409675.0,Literally! I can’t understand how other people aren’t depressed and don’t want to kill themselves
depression,ey8jmqy,t3_cvz4wk,1566921584.0,"I just turned 17 and I feel the exact same. I have a decent life but it’s just so bleak and monotonous and I can’t imagine how exhausting it would be to get a job in the future and just get stuck in the endless cycle of working to be able to afford a house and food, just to work more"
lonely,exuwx2s,t3_cufnl4,1566589366.0,Yep. When I’m drunk I can ramble on about random shit forever but when I’m sober I can hardly open my mouth.
lonely,exhgu4h,t1_exhgiul,1566304744.0,"thank you, and happy birthday to you for tomorrow!"
lonely,exhe121,t1_exhdql2,1566302415.0,thank you!!
lonely,exhcq15,t3_csutcg,1566301258.0,It’s my 17th birthday today and I’m sad
depression,exena8u,t3_csfulq,1566220542.0,this makes me feel so much better. i honestly thought that it was just me who felt like this
depression,exen0xq,t3_csda2z,1566220344.0,yep. it’s my birthday tomorrow and i already know i’m gonna want to die
socialanxiety,exc5uml,t3_crzomg,1566144104.0,Yessss me too
depression,ewrxwrw,t3_cpvwhh,1565716125.0,I literally feel the exact same about wishing I gave up and hitting rock bottom
depression,ewpsgz6,t3_cpjjz3,1565648266.0,ugh yes all the time. the problem is i’m only 16. and i have social anxiety so i’d be incapable of starting a new life and getting to know new people and stuff
depression,ewps2jv,t3_cpghbo,1565648003.0,"Yep except a lot of the time with me, nothing even has to happen for me to go back to being depressed. It just comes and goes randomly"
depression,ewprtcw,t3_cpidz8,1565647837.0,this is so relatable
depression,ewpcmry,t3_cpg4vs,1565638301.0,i relate so much to this
depression,ewo2pqz,t3_cp9jt6,1565602866.0,"yeah knowing that suicide is always an option keeps me going too. whenever i face a problem in life, i comfort myself with the thought ‘it’s alright, you can always kill yourself’. it just makes every day a lot easier knowing that i can fall back on suicide if things get really bad"
depression,ewo2al1,t1_ewnf3fq,1565602266.0,Yesss you just explained perfectly how it feels
depression,ewn00eu,t3_cp2zuk,1565564909.0,I’m 17 next week and I’m dreading it. Happy birthday to you tho!

depression,ewmvaai,t1_ewmuvkm,1565561407.0,"I'm not a frequent masturbator, I do it a few times a month, if that. But every time I do, I just feel unexplainable sadness, emptiness and guilt when I finish"
depression,ewmuipt,t1_ewmtzy8,1565560860.0,"I want to get better too but I just find it so difficult to put the effort in to do so when the thought of killing myself is so strong. Like, being dead would just be so much easier, so why even bother trying to get better? It’s such a bad mindset to be in but I can’t escape it and this is what convinces me that I’m not actually depressed, I’m just a lazy piece of shit"
depression,ewmub34,t3_cp23r4,1565560707.0,"Me too. When I’m alone I can’t help but think about how much I hate myself and how pointless life is. I can distract myself momentarily with certain stuff but not a day passes where I don’t think about how much I’d rather be dead. The only thing that does help is when I’m with my friends so then I just think to myself ‘You’re not depressed, you’re faking it and you’re actually just a lazy piece of shit. You don’t deserve help when there’s people way worse off than you’. I am convinced that I’m faking it and that’s what’s stopping me from getting help"
depression,ewmtqsj,t3_cozpzt,1565560307.0,Yep. I desperately want to be able to interact with people and make friends but I can’t help but think that I just annoy every single person I speak to
depression,ewmtaam,t1_ewmpd29,1565559988.0,Yep me too. It’s always passively in the back of my mind. I could be out having fun and I’ll just think to myself ‘Hmm this is nice. But you know what would be even better? Death’
depression,ewmt6qg,t1_ewlura7,1565559917.0,"I’m 17 next week and I’ve told my family I don’t want to celebrate my birthday anymore. It just makes me feel even more depressed knowing that it’s supposed to be a happy day, yet I still feel empty and disconnected"
depression,ewmt18b,t1_ewmsv9s,1565559807.0,"Yes me too! When I’ve just finished masturbating, I always get an unexplainable wave of sadness and hopelessness and suicidal thoughts"
depression,ewgho0a,t3_co7p00,1565382066.0,Me too and I honestly wish I could just do it
depression,ewf58il,t3_cnzlrj,1565351481.0,"I’m 16 and for some reason I just think I’m going to die before I get old. Not even in a suicidal way, I just can’t imagine myself living for very long"
depression,ew7arbz,t3_cn1dcj,1565188881.0,this is EXACTLY how i feel holy shit
