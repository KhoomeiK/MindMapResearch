LosAngeles,fmmw6j2,t1_fmmtgaq,1586213246.0,It was helpful for me and I told my coworkers just in case. It’s more confusing because the areas around Inglewood are pausing/not giving out tickets for street sweeping as far as I can tell. Inglewood parking is brutal compared to the surrounding neighborhoods.
LosAngeles,fmmupjp,t3_fw89bw,1586212440.0,"I’m an essential worker who lives near Inglewood and a lot of my work is over there. 2 weeks ago I had to go a house in Inglewood and I was tempted to park a few hours in a street sweeping spot because I wrongly assumed they were following LA’s lead. Glad I parked near a strip mall and walked. I was hoping they’d follow what LA is doing but I guess not. Luckily, I’ve been able to work solely out of my house ATM but if there’s an emergency that could easily change."
SandersForPresident,fjeymgf,t3_fd3z1p,1583280640.0,I’m cynical and nervous. I voted in the last primary for you and also in this one. No hesitation! I hope CA will deliver for you since we let you down last time.
SandersForPresident,fjex6dz,t3_fcsy5i,1583279871.0,"Voted in California and checked my mail in ballot to make sure it was accepted and it was. Got my Boomer dad to vote for Bernie and my X-gen aunt to vote for Bernie; her first vote as a citizen.

I’m really worried honestly. Even so, glad I voted for Bernie.

Got a text for a Liz supporter asking what’s holding me back from voting for her. It’s tldr but I wanted to share.


“I am a fan of her too. I sadly just don't see a path for her victory this election. She isn't polling first, second, or a close third in most of the Super Tuesday states. 

I also believe she made a lot of poor tactical political decisions. She is a progressive yet mostly went after Bernie. Yes, she dunked on Bloomberg but she repeatedly gave Biden a pass. She went after the moderates most people know would eventually drop because their poll numbers in states after Nevada were extremely low. 

Lastly I'm a poc who is biracial. Her claiming native ancestry personally left a bad taste in my mouth. I can and have overlooked that because policy and the progressive movement are more important than that. If Liz was polling second or first I'd be behind her 100000%

I don't know if you actually will read this or not, but those are my thoughts. “

Liz supporter said she did read my text and how well Liz did in the Nevada debate, how smart she is, that she has plans, etc. 

“She is brilliant. I started liking her years ago. She could win against Trump. Far more than Biden. Sadly she did not form the foundation and base she needed to. It sucks. After today, I don't even know if we'll even have a progressive candidate that could defeat Biden.”

Last message was Liz supporter saying she still believes Liz can still win and fight. I am much more cynical.

“She doesn't have a chance this time as president. Bernie might lose his chance tonight. 

I'll support her future endeavors if she runs as a progressive. Tonight the moderates and centrists might have ended our chances of big changes and a progressive candidate. I don't blame Liz. Some might, but not me. I hope she continues to bring progressive change as a senator or wherever she goes.”"

BipolarReddit,f1dig81,t3_d8vbem,1569385257.0,"I think it some states offer some sort of protection against some of those things. I'm a therapist and have bipolar. I've never told any places I work at or any of my clients. I actually had a previous therapist of mine reveal they had bipolar too. With all my therapists and my psychiatrists, they knew I worked in the field and never treated me differently. I've largely got my bipolar well under control. Sometimes I worry my coworkers can tell I'm bipolar somehow."

SandersForPresident,f0t3d9x,t1_f0spe7s,1568915238.0,"Besides policy, one of my biggest things against her running is the fact she barely got into the senate.

psychotherapy,eqh6mwy,t3_bybbpn,1560050337.0,"I worked with the elderly in my own practicum (65-110) and their adult children (40-60) and none ever brought it up. I now work with mostly children and women in their 20s and 30s and never had an issue. If it's brought, I'd follow up. When a client asks about age, it's rarely on the surface just about age. It's more like asking about experience and ""can you actually help me?"" 9 out of 10 times."
