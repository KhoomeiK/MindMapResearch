usps_complaints,fqkdijo,t1_fqjgfjq,1589425045.0,God that's crazy. at least you got them all!! tracking FINALLY updated for me lol but thank you!
usps_complaints,fqi1p3g,t1_fqgnq8e,1589388304.0,I saw your post and HOLY shit!!! wtf are they doing!! that's insane. you should definitely go in person and talk to them. I just went down to mine and talked to them and my package is in downtown of my city instead of the city I'm currently living in thats like 30 min away because apparently they have alot of stuff to sort through which I can understand but im just kind of an impatient person üòÇ they said I should receive it in at least 2 days which I feel like wont happen lmao
usps_complaints,fqi0o5g,t1_fqghivt,1589387823.0,thanks! I tried that and got someone
Fibromyalgia,fqgzaf8,t3_giu6an,1589362366.0,"definitely yeah I get random pains throughout my body! mostly dull like you said. it can start from my feet, up my legs to my hips and then my upper body and it changes locations on my body throughout the day and sometimes can even be a sharp pain. i get very stiff too, like I can barely move like my arms or bending down bc my back gets affected alot. but right now its 5am and havent slept yet bc all thru tonight I had a flare up and the pain is so distracting trying to sleep :/"
usps_complaints,fqfqj9z,t1_fqfpreh,1589329747.0,have you tried contacting the post office? or at least filing a lost package on the website?
usps_complaints,fqfpawy,t1_fqfoyab,1589329081.0,omg wtf??? that's ridiculous. yeah definitely makes me think they aren't sorting it or just half assing everything.
usps_complaints,fqeyuqt,t3_gijse2,1589315872.0,"meanwhile, my friend ordered from the same store. shipped yesterday and got delivered today??? like ok thanks lmfao this is why I prefer literally any other delivering company than usps."
usps_complaints,fqeyloi,t3_gihjso,1589315750.0,this is what it's been saying for me to for about 2 days now. hasn't updated at all
ADHD,fpqjghn,t3_getk47,1588824220.0,"Ayyyy congrats!! that's awesome!! I struggled with math alot too, I cant even remember if I ever had an A lol so its definitely something to be proud about !!üòÅ"
ADHD,fpqj8uw,t3_gek3fn,1588824076.0,i totally get the ghosting people part. i do it so much to my friends and I feel like a piece of shit but sometimes I just cant help it üò≠
ADHD,fpm9sk4,t3_ge6erw,1588728486.0,I'm not a student but I still feel this! my entire routine is ruined and I feel like my mindset is getting worse and worse. I got furloughed from my job at the end of april and then may 1st I got laid off permanently so everything is just a mess and I'm so unmotivated to do anything
ADHD,fpkw2ae,t1_fpks2sx,1588702031.0,i felt this so hard! and its not that i hate my friends but i just hate talking most of the time idk why lmao but im glad im not alone
ADHD,fpiy2vy,t3_gdifai,1588651482.0,awesome!! you should definitely be proud!! I'm having a hard time cleaning my room or doing the smallest things but your post definitely inspired me!!
ADHD,fpixsef,t3_gddwyw,1588651274.0,yes!!!! I recently met this person a couple months ago and we have all the same interests so we became good friends but in march  I just lost all interest in keeping a conversation going and I have to basically force myself which makes me feel horrible bc theyre genuinely a nice person
ADHD,fpiwvj1,t3_gdhsi8,1588650626.0,wait this is me too! I've been like this since high school (graduated 3 yrs ago) but it got so so much worse after I graduated and now it's just to the point where sometimes I have to force myself to talk.  I end up swiping the notification away and forgetting to even respond or simply ignoring it and it always makes me feel like a piece of shit but I try my hardest to explain to them and they're always pretty understanding but I feel like one day theyll be tired of it
POTS,fp77ixp,t3_gb3a3q,1588365470.0,"yes!!! thought it was just me!! doesnt help I have adhd too so I'm just hyper when I talk and I get super out of breathe/lightheaded, fatigue and fast heart rate lol"
POTS,fnd0uzz,t1_fnadgh4,1586854314.0,do the beta blockers help it?
POTS,fnd0t8a,t1_fnbroqo,1586854259.0,I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you find a doctor to help you asap! palpitations are scary. I dont think mine are bad enough yet for me to go on medications because they come and go but they still scare me. I have most of those symptoms you listed out too so Its definitely very tiring and stressful :/
POTS,fnd0mga,t1_fncp4pq,1586854044.0,"same here! whenever I'm just laying down in my bed, I get them. and then they somewhat calm down as I'm laying down for a little bit.  but if I get up, I get them again. and I have anxiety too so whenever I get the palpitations, I get anxiety about it bc I always think I'm gonna die and they get worse."

AskDocs,fm0ygls,t3_fsdg25,1585668624.0,"hi! I'm sick with a cold right now too. congested af, coughing and stuffy nose. my mom had it first and that terrified me bc she has a weak immune system and then I got it. but here's some reassurance, I have an anxiety disorder/hypochondriac too and I am not worried. with corona, the first main symptom is a fever. and sore throat/stuffy nose arent main symptoms! remember that colds and allergies still exist too! I also have bad allergies around this time. I would say if you have no fever, you're probably good. plus you said you havent been out except when needed, so the chances of you being a carrier is so low.  Corona is a virus and you would most definitely have a fever if you had it. It will be ok! were all dealing with this and stressed and worried but just try to distract yourself by watching or doing something!  just keep social distancing and washing ur hands!!"
Anxiety,fm0wnuo,t3_fsbsov,1585667635.0,Anime? hell yeah I definitely recommend my hero academia!! it'll keep you busy and take your mind off everything happening!! it's funny and action packed with great characters :)
Anxiety,flcxzq9,t3_fnzxpc,1585050852.0,"yes! I also get this! I try to have water next to me so when this happens I can take a sip and it helps, especially cold water! and I also put some headphones on with nice music, close my eyes and focus everything on my breathing and eventually my throat feels better."
Anxiety,flcxuw7,t3_fo03zc,1585050719.0,"yes!
headache, fatigue, sweaty hands, rapid heartbeat, tight chest, muscle aches and I clench my teeth alot! and these change everyday. some days I can have none or just a couple and other days, I have alot!"
Anxiety,flcx1sj,t3_fo2gmr,1585049901.0,"Hi! I've had this for a while now! I have to yawn alot to get a nice deep breath (literally yawned while typing this) and I also am constantly taking deep breaths. To reassure you more, I've had this for years, waaaaay before corona! it's most certainly a symptom of anxiety! I've researched about it alot and I read that some people are more aware of their breathing and feel like they have to take deep breaths which can be caused by anxiety. its definitely very annoying because I can just be relaxing in bad and then having to take very big deel inhales. but as I said, I've had this for as long as I can remember, I'm still doing fine, it's just very annoying! :)"
Anxiety,flcwm3p,t3_fo2woe,1585049438.0,"I experience this as well. I naturally have alot of post nasal drip and I have allergies as well so I'm clearing my throat, coughing now and then, headache and have sniffles but I know its probably allergies. What I find that helps for me is, I know I have allergies and that I get this every year. So I tell myself over and over again that it's just allergies and that I've had this before and I repeat it alot and eventually my brain starts to think that too."
Anxiety,flcw7ih,t1_flcuhjo,1585049004.0,I second that about animal crossing! definitely a relaxing game and takes my mind off everything that's happening!
Games,flcvk3s,t3_fn6axf,1585048297.0,I got this game solely because I was gonna be stuck at home. I've never played any of the other ones but I saw everyone talking about it and decided to buy it when it came out and I'm so glad I did. Its truly the best thing to have right now because i deal with alot of anxiety and COVID isnt helping but this game eases my anxiety so much and i love it. this game will definitely mean something special forever as it will forever be known as the game i played during the pandemic of 2020 lol
NintendoSwitch,flcuzme,t3_fm9f05,1585047658.0,I never played animal crossing before but everyone kept talking about it so i prepaid for it right before it came out and I'm so glad I did. it's the most relaxing thing ever and is helping my anxiety with everything that is happening. my mom has a weak immune system so ive been stressed about her getting sick but playing animal crossing has helped me relax and I couldn't be more thankful. thank you Nintendo üíï
Anxiety,fkvhzd1,t3_fjv541,1584569590.0,exactly! I have allergies every year and I'm so self conscious to cough in public so I feel forced to hold it in but people need to start understanding that people can still have allergies or even normal colds during all this!
Anxiety,fkvhqj5,t3_fkc6xs,1584569451.0,man I feel you! I'm an introvert so i stayed in alot before all this but now with basically having no choice to stay in bc I dont wanna get sick I feel so anxious and I hate it I just want things to go back to normal üò´
Anxiety,fkvhe2h,t3_fkxfqo,1584569257.0,"I understand what you're feeling!! just know you're not alone! I've been social distancing too which sucks I miss going out with friends and not having to worry. but I dont do dare go out except work which I wish would close because I have parents who are older and then my mom has health issues so I wouldnt forgive myself if I  was a carrier of it and gave it to her. but I've been trying to distract myself by watching shows or cleaning around the house and listening to some good music! this whole thing is crazy and you're right, life doesnt feel real too me either this is all happening so fast and this isnt what I thought 2020 would be like but I'm worried about the summer because I have alot of events as well! its stressful but we'll be okay. :)"
Anxiety,fkvfd62,t3_fktzf9,1584568087.0,yes! I find myself everyday all day either yawning constantly or having to take a big deep breathe in for no reason!
