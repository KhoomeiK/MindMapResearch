Certain businesses can buy things in bulk for cheaper, because they're businesses. Companies allow this to happen. Bethesda wouldn't just allow it to be sold on Steam, xbox, ps4 and call it a day. It pays a lot more to have private sellers as well, many companies do it, not just games."

The only information they shared, was that they successfully haven't self-harmed in a month. That is all you know.

You do not know if they are doing this for attention. You do not know if they tell this to their therapist, nor do you know if they have one or are even able to get one. As this is a sensitive issue, the most supportive thing we can do is speak to them, because there is always the chance they are telling the truth and not just getting attention. Aside from your comment about us not being able to help them, the fact that they have gained so much support just through replies can be enough for someone to feel better.

Something that will undoubtedly make them feel worse is a negative comment such as yours. As I implied before, it is better to be kind to them, as you do not know for certain whether this was posted for ""attention."" And even if it was, your comment would not add anything to the post anyway. It is only made to either make OP look bad, or to ensure your own pride in voicing your opinion."

There's other reasons. Due to hormones, especially in people with high amounts of male androgens/testosterone, acne can present as a massive problem. 

Hygiene also plays a massive role, of course.

But despite all that, even if one were to minimalize anything negative in their diet, and clean/wash properly every day, there are many who still will have acne. Some of these people can have *extreme* acne despite being in peak health with a perfect diet.
