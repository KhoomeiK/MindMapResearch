AskReddit,f77ce6g,t3_dunob8,1573450743.0,"NOTE: Most, if not all of these games are paid, and none of them (as far as I know) use ads or in-app purchases.


Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery, as well as Machinarium are two of my favorites.  They are point-and-click adventures with great visuals and some of my favorite soundtracks to this day.


Osmos is a physics-based puzzle game; the mechanics of which are very well explored, while having little to no filler.  One of my favorite puzzle games in general.


Fotonica is a simple runner with an interesting art style and unique navigation.  The controls are extremely simple, but can put you in a trance.


Downwell (aka reverse Doodle Jump) is a simple, arcady game with a surprising amount of depth in its systems.  Although it seems endless, it has a variety of stages and an actual ending.  Probably the most replayable game mentioned here.


VVVVVV, which now has an android port, is another greatly fleshed out puzzle game with a fun sense of humor.  The controls will probably take some getting used to, but I would say it's worth it.



Some more quick mentions:
- Her Story
- This War of Mine 
- Getting Over It 
- Monument Valley 
- Luxuria Superbia
- Triennale Games Collection 
(I would recommend the last two if you want something more experimental)"
