And if you’re a nail biter you probably have the habit of peeling the gel off like I do which is a big no no. My friend who does my nails on occasion watches me peel off her gel so fast and gets mad lol. Normal polish may chip faster sometimes but it can be much better for us nail biters.

Or you’re being severely abused and need out of a situation. But that’s pretty rare. Even if you’re not suicidal DBT will help with the self harm. I’m over a year self harm clean and even tattooed over a problem area (not finished yet because the rona causing my tattoo appointments for shading to be cancelled) and I 100% wouldn’t have been able to do it without DBT. I don’t know your age but I’m assuming under 18 or just turned 18 so I’m going to just say this: therapy doesn’t cure you on it’s own. Therapy only works when you work. If the therapy book tells you to rub your tummy while patting your head, do it. Use the DBT skill “throwing yourself into the moment” or whatever it’s called and fully throw yourself into the exercise. Do it like you’re teaching a young child and making them excited for it. Also here’s a tip for mindfulness meditation practices if you’re in a group setting. If you can’t get comfortable in the seat while sitting up, reach down and hold your ankles and look at the floor. I got through a lot of uncomfortable practices by limiting my view to the floor and stretching my back out. Also, plain talk therapy didn’t work for me in high school. I should have been in DBT or some type of therapy that utilizes exercises to actively do like homework. And I should have been journaling but oh well too late I’m 23 and taking therapy serious now."

I had it mid high school(2013?). I went through it and ripped everything I had out of it (I only had a few things as it was still only like 8 pages) INCLUDING A CONDOM WRAPPER (I think the condom wrapper was fuel to rip it out but I imagine the shit I wrote was crazy) and threw all of the writing away as well as the wrapper don’t worry I didn’t keep it. I have whatever ticket stubs were in there but like destroyed the journal itself. I wish I kept it and finished it as well as other 8 page in journals I had through childhood. I’m 23 now and have nothing from high school like that but at the same time, do I really want stuff from a time I was absolutely convinced I wasn’t going to make it to 18? I sometimes remember the abuse/bullying I was put through and to have a written record of it while dealing with new stuff on top of the childhood shit does not sound fun.

Journaling,fqhodlu,t3_gisrxm,1589381122.0,"I was confused what you meant in the caption so I  read the journal entry which isn’t something I normally do and I found a few things amusing. The “see therapy is fake and useless! Ima pretend  I wasn’t researching dbt like yesterday!” comment (obvs not word for word my memory is shit) had me laughing because there was something you said above about how you’ll never let yourself feel this way again, but with DBT you’re allowed to have emotions and feel them, but it teaches you how to not react based off of them. Then you said something about showering later on and said “(yay self care)” or something like that which is technically the PLEASE skill I believe. Basically feeding yourself, sleeping, showering, taking the proper meds, etc. so while a lot of these things are taught to everyone without slapping the DBT label on them, it’s still a form of it. I don’t know what you’re suffering with but if it’s BPD, bipolar, PTSD, or really anything else DBT is super helpful. It won’t make you happy, that’s what CBT is for, but it will make you stable and calm the crisis and able to be ready for next steps in therapy. It’s lifesaving but it’s job isn’t to make you happy it’s to safe your life. You know? I started journaling after graduating DBT and I only had an appointment every 6 weeks and it’s been so helpful to me and even more helpful once I started new methods in it. So take what you learn in therapy and apply it to your journal. The pros and cons lists in DBT can be done in your journal and you can reflect back on it later and see the date you did it vs how things are now.  And if you’re going to reflect back in the future, give your future self room to write. I literally have the same problem in the first 40 pages of my journal. No space left what so ever. But don’t feel obligated to change your journaling because I said something only if you want to I’m just encouraging therapy and showing you methods you can try in the future!!"

Journaling,fqacuff,t3_ghh83q,1589216893.0,"I watched the youtuber seaweed kisses talk about her journals as friends. The idea sounded great until I realized I never had a lot of good friends and that’s why the idea of multiple journals I can control as my friends sounded cool. Here’s the thing though: some of her journals served the exact same purpose and were actively being used at the same time. Now I know her channel is heavily based on journaling so it’s her career but like there’s a line when it’s TOO MUCH. I have let’s say 3. One I write down poetry I find but don’t consider a journal. More like a commonplace of random poetry. The other is a few prayers I really had to write down about a specific set of people who are sadly still in my life and I really never wanted in my life. I have that in a cheap ulta journal my mom gave me with a daiso cover. And then my normal journal which is basically for therapeutic and expression uses. They don’t clash with each other. I don’t want my normal journal to be filled with prayers for them, maybe once I use up some of the extra cheap ulta journals and I’m past this season but right now no. As for the poetry, I don’t consider it a journal. Just like how in the mail is a moleskine sketchbook that I’m going to use to basically “scrap book” some really old stuff for middle school, high school, and before that. It’s all stuff I can move into a book form for storage. No entries. If I had 7+ “friends” or journals like she does that’s too much clutter for active journals. Going through one journal at a time and storing used and unused is easier than having more than 3 unused. Poetry is with my other poetry books, unused journals are with my self help books being stored on my book shelf. My prayer journal sits with my bible and Christian books. And my normal Journal is out in the open on my desk or bed or whatever. So that’s my storage argument, my next is why would I even want to jump from unfinished journal to unfinished journal when I already do that with things like crochet projects and such. There’s no consistency and no self discipline or self control. If I keep with one journal to the end I’m doing myself a great service. New notebooks are exciting but so is seeing a journal to the end which I’ve never really done. I had another journal I finally filled in a cry for help one day with a word on each page but it’s not the same. I don’t know. I’m overwhelmed by too many journals. I’m enjoying this hobby right now and if I start random journals I can’t finish then I’ll get overwhelmed and lose interest. I am happy with what I have. I do have two failure journals from trying to start them and luckily one of them is a red soft over with red pen on one page of OC poetry notes so I can just use it for the next prayer journal when I’m done with my others and another is a sketchbook that was supposed to be a commonplace book that I just abandoned which is why I like the idea of only having as little active journals as possible. Having as many as that youtuber is really not ideal for me and really for most of us. I am good with one friend in this case."

But if you stick to minimal decor in your bullet journal and just focus on the skeleton of bullet journaling as well as your handwriting, you can probably improve it with practice in your journal and you’ll have a dated system that’s you can see the improvement after a year or a few months. Especially if you keep it simple you’ll have a great minimal before and after shot."
Journaling,fqa7jxo,t3_ghokl5,1589214214.0,I feel the same and the only thing I’ve achieved is more stretch marks and at my highest weight which was NOT a goal of mine. This time has been shit.
