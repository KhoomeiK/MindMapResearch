>who they can intimidate

Proving you understand him less than the 'angry youth' you complain about. You've lost any right to condescension, that was quick. This is the Nazi's interpretation. Let me educate you, and yes I am condescending - 'power' in Nietzsche is an answer to his main contemporary influence as a philosopher who was of course, Schopenhauer. So Schopenhauer, following Kant in philosophising a fundamental 'thing-in-itself' independent of human phenomenology, anticipated Nietzsche in conceptualising existence as being fundamentally a malignant *will* that he called the will to *life*, which is just like desire in Buddhism. He advocated a sort of asceticism whereby the wise man would practice disattachment and free himself from will and from life - Nietzsche rejects this as the life-denial characteristic of both (post-Christian) Western and Eastern metaphysics calling it both 'a European Buddhism' (in an incredulous tone) and more bluntly, 'nihilism'. He advocates instead an affirmation of life and will that he calls the will to *power*, a creative force by which the individual asserts himself in the world the main form of which is artistic achievement (which he believed required some domination of others, but that wasn't the main point).

> Nietzche was a child of his era, and you can't really understand his writings without a deep understanding of the culture of 19th Century Germany

And what the fuck makes you think I don't?

I am almost certainly more well-read than you are - this means I understand the historical-intellectual context of Nietzsche's writings including but not limited to - the Western philosophical tradition from Plato/Socrates to the dominant Kantianism and German idealism of Nietzsche's time, Christianity, the classics and Hellenicism he specialised in, even figures like Wagner and Napoleon who are important in his writings. Is that enough for you?

> Nietzche was surrounded by elitism claiming it was charitable (but filled with contempt for others)

He identified contempt as an essential feature of charity, all charity - not a false charity that posed as charity but was really something else. Around the same time, Oscar Wilde made a critique of charitable institutions and charity *as* an institution in *the Soul of Man Under Socialism*, correctly characterising them as concerned with only keeping poor people alive and never attempting to systematically address the causes of poverty that might eradicate it in the long-run - thus legitimising the status of those in poverty, like the people who volunteer in soup kitchens believing God made the homeless to teach them grace and humility or w/e. That's like what you're doing when you give to the homeless.

Do you admire figures like Teresa of Calcutta? Did you ever think of exactly what type of person is attracted to 'caregiving' roles like that? Of course, they are nearly all women. Imagine a nurse working in a  nursing home or a hospice, in charge of some annoying half-senile old man, he might annoy her but she knows that she's basically in charge of his medication and if and when he gets it. This is 'power' according to how many people think of it, and they seek it in this form. And they'll call it 'compassion'. It's Satanic.

Same w/ mothers who try to stop their children from growing up, that way they stay forever dependent on them in their loving 'care'.

You either *are* just such a person (and I know them, they live their entire lives in abject fear of being seeing for what they are) or you're too naive to see the world clearly. Most people don't want to see reality clearly - it's very sobering and they'd rather stay intoxicated.

> Nietzche thought pity was ""a loss of power"" because etc.

Charity is degrading to both the recipient and the donor. that's what he meant.





> You can't take his ideas and apply them to the present as if the past was just the same. 

1) - the trends he saw in his present are *more* developed in today's postmodern world, that is a prescient characteristic that genius can have, he could be of the future more than being a 'child of his time' like you said 2) - this is a dumb attempt to just 'win the argument' on your part, the ideas you implicitly extol, the alleged virtue of charity and pity, are far *older* than Nietzsch's. So wtf are you saying?


> and it was very, very different from ours.

And like I said, his world was at least on the cusp of modernity and is recognisably such. Whereas what you're defending is the straightforward traditional Christian valorisation of pity and compassion, which is obviously *pre*-modern. So the vastness of difference can't even be compared. So by your own argument, you're the one who's bound to be 'egregiously wrong' if anyone is - you certainly can't take Christ's teaching on 'let he who has not sinned throw the first stone' etc. in a world where compassion was extremely restricted if it existed at all and didn't cross social or ethnic boundaries (hence the parable of the Good Samaritan)."

> You see, some people don’t automatically compare their own social status to everyone else the meet. When they see other people, they don’t think “he/she is higher/lower status than me,” they think other things, like “hey, someone asked me for some money. Do I have any? Can I afford to give it to them?” And if the answer is “yes” to both, they give them the money. The idea of “status” never crosses their mind.

So something is only real if it 'crosses their mind'. Rape someone and it never 'crosses your mind' they didn't consent, you didn't actually rape them - sounds cool fam. Status governs all human interactions whether you like it or not. No one has less status than the homeless - that's why people feel very magnanimous to interact with them at all.

> While still other people might think “they look like they’re in a bad place. I remember when I was in a bad place years ago, I’d’ve really appreciated someone helping me out.”

And like I said: no one was ever 'helped' by a handful of change thrown at them. So whatever the motive is, 'help' is not one of them. there you begin looking at the psychology of such an action.

> I’m sorry you’ve experienced contempt in that situation. No wonder you don’t like the idea.
But that doesn’t mean that others feel that same way.


Ahahaha, you think I've been a homeless bum? You really don't have much imagination at all, do you? I threw change at bums when I was a lot younger before I realised how gross it was.

Can you get it thru your head nothing I said is necessarily based on how any given person reports to 'feel' while they're doing it, that there's actually meaning in actions beyond that?

> And all those different motives

An action is contemptuous or not regardless of your self-reported 'motives'. Like I said rape is rape regardless of any professed motives involved.

> However, I now understand that you assume it’s pity because that’s all you’ve experienced in this situation before. 

Again, you think someone would only say what I said if they were homeless(?) which...no. never happened, sorry to disappoint you. You really seem to have no imagination whatsoever, unable to even envision someone having a view or opinion that isn't based on very visceral emotional reactions to things 'in the moment'. Because that's what everything *you* think is based on, see?

I have a lot of imagination, so I can read meaning into things that aren't directly connected to my own circumstances. 

> But I promise, and I know this from personal experience, that pity, sympathy and empathy are all possible at those moments. 

Pity is incompatible w/sympathy or empathy, probably more incompatible than anything else - more so than hatred or anger, certainly. Again, you just prove you don't know what you're taking about. 


> And pity, despite its bad rep, isn’t always a bad emotion to feel

So you, with very little insight into human nature, say:


'Pity…is a depressant. A man loses power when he pities [and when he's pitied]. ... Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those who have little pride and no prospect of great conquests; for them easy prey — and that is what all who suffer are — is enchanting.

""Pity is a waste of feeling, a moral parasite which is injurious to the health, 'it cannot possibly be our duty to increase the evil in the world.' If one does good merely out of pity, it is one's self and not One's neighbor that one is succouring. Pity does not depend upon maxims, but upon emotions. The suffering we see infects us; pity is an infection.""

But I didn't say I wanted there to be no social conditioning b/c that would leave everyone obeying their base nature and then there would be no society at all - this is just elementary social contract theory.

> Helping or getting help is quintessentially human

No homeless person is in a situation where crumbs of change help them in any meaningful way, so what purpose does it serve?

It's almost common knowledge that charity is degrading to the recipient, it's a more subtle point that it's equally degrading to the benefactor. OP was positively describing interactions based on dehumanising pity and degradation, which should tell you something about them.

 You might notice if you're observant that no charitable organisation seeks to tackle any societal problem on a structural level that might serve to eradicate them in the long run, that's b/c they don't want to. It's all palliative care. They want poverty and degradation to exist, they don't see it as a problem to be solved - as fas as they're concerned, God made homeless people so they could feel good about themselves which is why they throw change or crumbs of food at them - and those people are *supposed* to be homeless, in the 'charitable' worldview.

> Why pick the most emotionally unpleasant word to describe it, when it’s just as easy to use another word?

B/c it's the only one that's accurate, the other words wouldn't be accurate which would make it a lie and telling a lie is not 'just as easy' for me as telling the truth, even if the truth is 'emotionally unpleasant' to you. It is not empathy or any of those other things, it is pity.

The suicidal impulse can feel like clarity, it's a restlessness and a difficulty reconciling with existence - whereas depression taken to its logical conclusions would make suicide equally as pointless as living, nothing is preferable to anything else.

Depression is way over-associated w/ suicide imo, if ppl commit suicide due to depression it's probably b/c they still *can* and that's a meaningful act that's left to them, whereas if they keep living they'd only become more depressed and soon lose the will to do anything or even draw a distinction between living and dying."

To even name ‘the grand sun of existence’ as something w/meaning implicitly defined it in contradistinction to something else, like the paradox that occurs w/‘nothing’ I mentioned elsewhere. Well if it’s all there is, that something else must be itself. So by it’s very nature it is self-interaction. Infinite awareness has nothing to be aware of *but* itself.

It’s not that reality is a collection of elements and you add them up to a ‘sum’ and this magically becomes ‘the grand sum of existence’ that has special properties that aren’t there when you subtract 1 or a quadrillion elements.

When it isn't of course - nothing is nothing and something is something, that's identity.

So a way to understand it is that there is nothing *andl* there is something. There would also be nothing if there weren't something.
