My dad raised me, he was not a good father figure, never invested in my interests growing up and during the latter half of those years his negligence got so bad to the point where we lived in a house with no furniture, wall paper or carpet and 13 cats. It was like living in a house ready to be demolished.

It was only after I started making friends finally in college and seeing more of the world that I realised how truly awful he made everything for me.

So i made myself homeless to get into supported housing, that lasted about 3 years and I then went to university, graduated at the top of my class.

I'm 28 now, these last 7 years have been pretty hard, redundancy, been fired... I think I'm about to lose my job again because of the pandemic... But I'm not scared.

I have friends and new family who will be there for me, and while I might not know how to really make money or start a business... I'm confident enough to find out how.

Fast forward and I decide to keep him company one night, trying to be the good friend and cheer him up, we're playing guitar hero 3 trying to do that dragonforce song on expert mode.

I held the fret board, he strummed. We just couldn't beat it. So we gave up after a while and things got... Quiet.

Awkwardly quiet.

I then just outwardly said ""I like you, you know."" then he says ""Yeah I guessed.""

We locked eyes for a bit, then leaned in closer and we just start full on making out on the sofa. Getting mustache hair in my mouth it was messy.
