But I have spent all this time miserable because those have been my focus. I’m sorry if the way I phrased things came off as though I thought the virus was a good thing (and I’ll admit it was poorly phrased), but I am trying to look on some bright side here too.

It doesn't for me, but the Geodon is for both my BP and my Panic Disorder so that could be counteracting possible anxiety?

The 300 of Wellbutrin is a new increase, so I'm hoping to see more progress with the ADHD because that's what I've been struggling with the most lately, but it seems to be helping a bit.

Luckily I somehow still passed (with .3% to spare in one of my classes lmao) all of my classes, but that shit was hard. To be honest, the main thing that got me by was the hypomania because then I'd study incessantly. I would highly recommend creating a playlist of music that you ONLY listen to when you need to be in ""school mode."" That was one of the things that helped. Other than that, see if you can get in with student disability services! That's what I'm working on now to see if I can get some test accommodations. Good luck! :)"

I've been emotional since I left and he's offered to cancel nights out to just be on the phone with me and comfort me, and he even considered flying overseas (when he's never been on a plane, let alone out of the States) to be here with me.  


Now, I'm not saying I expect anyone to do that much for me (and I'm beyond lucky to have the man that I do) but if anyone, literally ANYONE had been this level of disrespectful to me in that time, I would never be able to look them in the face again.
