depression,f61krr5,t3_dq6i9k,1572641830.0,Your not alone man. I wish life had an exit button besides suicide. I'm 30 years old and I don't even want the rest of the years of my life because I know I'm facing nothing but bullshit. It's the asshole people of this world who make it hard for those who just want to LIVE!
depression,f5y8qlz,t3_donuan,1572552489.0,"I live in Omaha Nebraska. A city so filled with hate people won't give you a chance to make a living. I've got the bullets to took my self out, but I know that if I do, I break code. So I take my suffering like a man. Trying very very hard not to be that guy who goes out shooting up people and places."
depression,f4ziqwx,t3_dlfw2v,1571908205.0,"Your not alone G. I too feel out of place in this world. Like I don't belong. No matter where I go people test me. The worse part is, I can't stop thinking about killing these people or myself and can't even hold a job because people start with me. I told doctors/psychiatrists and all about these tremblings, but they said they can't do anything for me unless I do kill someone. Which is fucked up. The best thing for me to do is stay away from people. By doing so I can't go into psycho mode."
