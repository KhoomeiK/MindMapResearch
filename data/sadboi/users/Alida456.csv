belowdeck,foypejl,t3_gabd8w,1588176725.0,I find it awkward . Like quit trying to market yourself .
mentalhealth,fow2p0h,t3_g9s74q,1588111907.0,I believe we listen to our thoughts and a positive mindset does help . I try to tone down this belief because I know it can be annoying . I don’t understand why other people would be happy if someone is struggling right now . Maybe some compassion because you understand . Rather than gloating ........
personalfinance,fo71p1t,t3_g618ro,1587570686.0,I had this happen with my daughter . They said it wasn’t an emergency . BUT the hospital determined she had to ride in an ambulance because she wasn’t safe . Therefore an emergency. Since we had no choice about the transport I appealed and won . It did take a long time to settle though
mentalillness,fm8zo75,t3_fto6b3,1585858973.0,Just don’t answer your phone . They can’t do anything unless they have proof that you are in direct danger . I never answer my phone. I will listen to messages and return a call if needed . Everyone I want to talk to uses some form of messaging. You don’t have to explain yourself to any random person calling you . Don’t let them intimidate you .

Wellthatsucks,fllrjqk,t3_fpjhcn,1585266301.0,Kid parties are more about the parents. Who will be willing to give ride etc . I always made sure I had a few “ for sures” for a party . I feel so bad for kids that have almost 100% no shows . It’s usually has nothing to do with the kid .its more about timing and planning. Those invites also get lost between school and home.

was that nasty 😮😮"
Etsy,fdnb1pk,t3_em395a,1578581901.0,Me too!! You would think if a person could come up with this scam they would be capable of earning money legally .
Etsy,fdmyuj2,t3_em395a,1578571760.0,Thanks !! Makes sense now . Good to know what to watch for .
Etsy,fdmwhgj,t3_em395a,1578569004.0,Can someone explain how the scam works . In the links posted it says the sellers are the scammers . In this post you are saying the Etsy sellers didn’t know anything about the small orders they received as being a scam . How do the scammers make money in that case?
Etsy,fcb14vd,t3_egtx35,1577580649.0,"I agree , it has a scam feel to it . I would love for it to be true ."
MadeMeSmile,fcaxrwe,t3_egsnt0,1577578717.0,I saw something pretty cool to do for your kid . Where was the attempt to shame anyone ( poor dads) I don’t see that happening
belowdeck,f6k968x,t3_drpbik,1572907853.0,Can’t wait 😊
belowdeck,f4p0sxz,t1_f4orr96,1571712935.0,I just posted this in a below deck Facebook group . If two men were doing that to captain sandy think of the outrage . It was not okay 😡
belowdeck,f1wzxb7,t3_da1ejb,1569791678.0,Holy 😮😮 it says miniature clam chowder . Gourmet food is already miniature..... I can’t imagine how small this will be
belowdeck,ezunnlp,t3_d2f1un,1568156634.0,She seems to work hard and have a great attitude . I thought she was brave to take on the chef challenge and she didn’t pretty good . A big amount of the complaints were cold food . That wasn’t her fault and Ben is freaking out in that horrible galley .
mentalillness,exg19p3,t3_cskkv9,1566253157.0,I’m so sorry . It would be so hard to deal with this situation.  You will drive yourself crazy to to get her to do things . It might be time to think of yourself . Do the basic care for her but then think of yourself . Go to family events alone . Plan some hobbies and projects just for you . My daughter had severe mental health issues . I slowly lost myself along the way . You can’t take care of anyone if you don’t take care of yourself first .
philosophy,ewwtsg1,t3_cqaliy,1565835161.0,"I love Facebook for its groups . I run several mental health support groups . It’s a great tool and I have found it to be life changing. . However , I am currently looking for another platform . Lately Facebook has been taking down mental health groups with no warning . Groups that people have worked on for years . The reason given is the group is violating Facebook community standards . Words like suicidal or self harm are found and the whole group is removed . One violation I got was because a mom asked how to help her son with self harming . So now the groups are trying to figure out how to support people while at the same time worrying about key words . It’s ridiculous ."
artstore,euez8yh,t3_cg05h6,1563758091.0,Love this !
facepalm,eu15ofv,t3_ce5ize,1563361019.0,Hmm my dogs don’t clean the house or do anything productive . I clean up after them 😡 I will have a talk with them about this .
ContagiousLaughter,etnde29,t3_ccijhc,1562983845.0,That was adorable 😂
belowdeck,etbvn36,t3_cawv25,1562664151.0,I thought the same thing . They just enjoyed and appreciated everything so much . 😊
belowdeck,erwa0ni,t3_c4fnza,1561337497.0,What!! I thought she lives alone . Or with a small dog 😮
ForeverAlone,eqgmq70,t3_by7qiw,1560038814.0,I love smart phones and social media . As someone who never was able to interact with others comfortably this has opened  a whole new world for me . I have joined groups and connected with people around the world . It’s truly an amazing experience and should not be taken for granted . I am old so I remember how lonely and isolated the world was before social media . If you were unique and stuck in a small town you were so alone . Now you can reach out and connect with like minded people .
BravoRealHousewives,eqa11qi,t3_bxkokz,1559922628.0,Well thats what makes the show interesting . Have you noticed how boring it got without her ? Their only storyline was bitching about her . Telling people about what happened to the puppy wasn’t bad at all anyway  . It shouldn’t have ended up at a kill shelter .
BravoRealHousewives,eq89nq8,t3_bxkokz,1559861380.0,Don’t blame her a bit . Why go and deal with the same old shit . Stupid story line . She didn’t give the puppy to a shelter . How is she the bad guy ???
belowdeck,eq48str,t3_bx7h1j,1559771730.0,I thought the same thing . I’m thinking the real chef couldn’t make it for the first charter so they decided to have some fun with it . I don’t mind it I enjoy the drama .
belowdeck,epy1e1r,t3_bwj6y6,1559616527.0,Wth was that ??😮😮 I love watching the food . Hamburgers and tacos ... those guest were so kind . ....
belowdeck,eoqk8nu,t3_bsu7t3,1558793143.0,Were their guests on board at the time ? I always thought when they said no drinking they meant when the guests were on board so they were on call24/7.
TwoXChromosomes,eoognk4,t3_bsitfv,1558738067.0,Your doctor is an idiot . I had an ablation and never got another period or cramp . It’s been a life changer for me . A hysterectomy does have  other complications . If you can find a doctor that does an ablation it’s the perfect solution . Mine was done 10 years ago so I can tell you long term it was the best solution.
