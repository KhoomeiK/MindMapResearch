Anxiety,fjkdl96,t3_fdxbw2,1583425023.0,"I have gotten myself so focused on breathing before that something similar happens, but it was intentional.  The systems that cause you to breather are autonomous and will act without you being aware of them.  Just relax, and don't get keep yourself stuck in an anxiety feedback loop over the breathing."

selfhelp,fjhyzzu,t1_fjhwdnx,1583357668.0,"As stupid as it sounds, continually repeating it to yourself in the mirror can go a LONG way.  I am a clinical hypnotist, and I work with people regularly who have one picture of themselves in their subconscious and another in their conscious mind.    


We take in a lot of negativity all day long, and that affects us at a subconscious level; that is what builds a lot of negative self-images.  We then (as a culture) don't spend the time in our minds to help combat that and teach it to do the things we want.    
Long way: notes on the mirror, repeating it daily  


Faster: mindful and deep meditation, use that affirmation as part of your chant back to yourself.  
Fastest: hypnosis, a carefully constructed story for the subconscious, can have wonderous results.    


Real change in our lives is possible and is achievable."
selfhelp,fjhgdr4,t3_fdfvqj,1583347600.0,"First off, I have to say, NO ONE IS WORTHLESS.   It may feel that way sometimes, and a fresh environment, fresh people, a fresh outlook can help... but those aren't easy to accomplish either.  We all have roots.  

Have you tried meditation?  I gained a lot of insight and comfort from looking inward and spending time both doing empty mind meditation as well as directed.  Our minds do have a lot of answers for us, but we are often too loud to ever hear them."
Anxietyhelp,fjhe44m,t3_fdf7id,1583346351.0,"Good deal; glad you found something that was helpful.  If you don't mind me getting a bit more personal, did you have general anxiety, or was it only within specific parts of your life?  I am continually looking for new techniques that can help people without the use of medications."
