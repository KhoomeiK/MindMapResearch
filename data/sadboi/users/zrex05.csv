EatingDisorders,fj5dav4,t3_fbhcba,1583029946.0,"Yep, it's ""you know that we are here to support you"" but also

Won't shut up about food.

Constantly asking me for weight loss advice (as if I'm a damn specialist)

Offering me food, and for whatever reason being very persistent about it ""Oh come on, you gotta try this!"" Like how about no

Angry when they notice I'm upset near food

Intently watching me (try to) eat

(I love them to death but jfc)"
starbucks,fhynogr,t3_f5bnqo,1581979728.0,I've worked at two locations and there is serious contrast between them.  I love the one that I'm at now and everyone gets along with each other really well.  Probably would've lasted a month tops at the other location with how snippy and unnecessarily nasty they were.
gainit,fhvqyed,t3_f4w5l9,1581900287.0,"I mean if you‚Äôre so skinny that you‚Äôre underweight and don‚Äôt care about muscle, I guess just eat until you manage to find yourself in the healthy weight range. But honestly, if this isn‚Äôt the case and you still want to gain weight, might as well make it muscle for a better physique as well as for other health benefits. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll basically be the same as you are now, just with annoying and unnecessary fat which isn‚Äôt good for you on top of whatever fat you already have.  So either stay skinny or put on lean mass when gaining weight."

gainit,fg8cglx,t3_exfbyo,1580615468.0,"I successfully put on some good weight fasting 16-18 hours a day, getting in about 3000 calories between 2pm-9pm (was fasting just to try and see how I felt, and 3000 calories because I'm on the smaller side and not in need of more). Made no difference whatsoever in terms of my progress as long as I hit my numbers, also saved me time in the mornings, was really focused, and felt less bloated probably since my gut has a longer time to rest from digesting food. Not for everybody but IF is something that I think I will stick to.  Cheers!"

bipolar,ff6mohi,t3_eruej7,1579630468.0,"It‚Äôs a shame that good news announcement/praise doesn‚Äôt spread far beyond buying a car or getting engaged. It would do wonders if people who are staying clean, out of trouble with law, or people like us who stay out of the hospital don‚Äôt get the same positive feedback. We may go seemingly less noticed, but don‚Äôt stop spreading the good news of your life. You may encourage others to do the same with their good news. Proud of you!"

I‚Äôm addition to some of the study grind you have to put in, a lot of it can be fun via mobile apps or going to language meetup groups. It can also help to make small adjustments to what you already do such as changing the language of your entertainment."
