AmItheAsshole,fqgv7zg,t3_gin1jq,1589358280.0,"NAH; however, as a child that grew up in this exact situation (my dad cheated on my mom after me, married that woman and had a baby with her, and then cheated and divorced her), I’m eternally grateful that my mom and my sister’s mom worked something out. My sister is one of my best friends, and it’s unlikely that it would have happened without their cooperation (we also live quite a bit apart, so they needed to actually bring us to one another). They used to not get along at all, but over time grew to be somewhat of friends. They were duped by the same man that made them both fall in love with him, so it was somewhat of a bonding point, I think?"
