Advice,flawmoo,t1_flavcfi,1584992614.0,"My countries law states that once you're 18, the money is to go directly to you. I take care of most of my needs. 

Key word ""help"", the thing about helping is that it means that each parent does their part. I think that
Parents A paying for the bills and parent B basic needs is a resonable split. 

Also if I get a job during the weekend no one will be able to baby sit my younger sibling and that will be a huge issue. Why? Because she will have to pay a baby sitter and at that point it won't even make sense for her to work. 

We had a conversation. She herself said that I could get him to pay it into her account and she would give me the money to me in cash. We had a conversation about our living arrangement before too and it is a mutually beneficial relationship that we are both fine with.

Asking her for it? I am not asking her for it. I don't need to. We both know how this work and she herself is aware that the money belongs to me. 

Seriously though, what's with you? You're really adamant about it."
Advice,flattb7,t1_flaebuz,1584990986.0,"Indeed but here is the deal. I am a college student, I am in education. She is responsible for 1/2 of it as my parent as long as I continue education and can't support myself, the amount I get from my dad is based on the idea that she pays for 1/2 of it. She decided to have a child, everyone knows that it's a huge responsibility. I am not earning money but I baby sit for her. 

Also she doesn't pay gas for me or use gas on me. Electric and water would be very low for me and when it comes to food, it would be very low too.  

Child maintenance is for me to take care of my needs, it's not just for bills. She doesn't pay for my clothes, she doesn't pay for my hygiene products, she doesn't pay for any of my basic school supplies. If she did then I would get it if she wanted the money for that but here is the thing... She doesn't.

I would be off at uni right now (thus would have moved out at 18) if not for some crap she pulled. I do not pay rent nor do I pay for any of the bills. Instead what I do is that I provide a service by baby sitting my younger sibling for at least 20 hours each week. If you do the maths on that it will become obvious that what I provide is on the same level as paying rent. (UK, so the rent is resonable, through out the month those 20x4=80 hours would be enough to cover all of the rent.) 

Those payments have to go to me based on my countries law and I literally have to make a choice. I either tell my dad to pay the money directly to me or get some paperwork sorted that directs him to keep paying the money into my mum's account. This is not me insisting that the money is my, this is literally the money that is legally my that I have to make a decision about. She knows that. I know that and even my dad knows that. 

She won't charge me rent because then I would refuse to baby sit and she would have to pay for a baby sitter which would mean that she would be loosing money. If she charged me rent it wouldn't amount to how much we pay for rent either. Plus if I moved out she would have to start paying what we call a bedroom tax. Either way it wouldn't be good for her financially."

No friends? It sounds like the kid just sits in front of a computer all day long. He needs to get out, be more active and have friends, he needs something else that he can do instead of playing games, something fun and productive. 

The library is a good idea but it should be treated more as a fun option/family activity rather than something that gets pushes down the kids throat as that will more likely than not make the child associate the library/studying/education with negative feelings and that will just make them oppose it.

Seriously, what you're talking about is punishment but this child needs a lesson. After the lesson is learned, if he does it again then it should be followed by a punishment. 

The parents need to teach him the value of money, how to spend money and so on because they obviously didn't do their jobs. They also need to sit him and help him with his homework, it sounds like he had a lot of catching up to do. Maybe they could make him follow a schedule?

I know a guy who had 10 girlfriend in the last 3 years. Each time it didn't go well. I met him about a year ago and got to watch things go down between him and a girl he was into.

His main reason for dating is that he thinks it will improve his mental health, give him motivation and increase his self esteem. He believes this to be 100% healthy but based on what I seen I couldn't disagree more so I'm gonna give a few examples:
-Blamed her for his mental health getting worse. What horrible thing did she do? She asked to get to know him before deciding if she wants to date him. Like he straight up told her that while knowing she has depression and didn't think that there was anything wrong with this.
-Claims to be putting her first but it always goes back to his needs. If he worries about her it's always because it will negatively affect him if she isn't in perfect condition.
-Cuddling 24/7 even if she say no cuz it helps his mental health.
-She wanted to cut her hair. Well she can't and he is going to ""save her"" because her cutting her hair will trigger his PTSD. She need to be exactly how he wants her to be. 
-GF= free therapist that NEEDS to be always there for him and support him all the time. 
-Him and suicide is like the boy who cried Woolf. I get that this ain't a nice thing to say but it happens like weekly at the very least and he refuses any help for it. At this point whenever he says he is going to attempt it, he might as well be telling me it's Wednesday and it's always her fault in someway. 
< At least one of them is happening at any given time.


I don't consider the guy to be mentally stable like at all. I am 100% against him dating anyone untill he gets better because of the stuff he does and how he acts.

If you're stable enough not to pull anything like the stuff I mentioned above then go for it. If you just struggle with mental health and needs comfort/help from time to time then that isn't a reason not to date. If the relationship is good like at lest most of the time then I don't think there is anything wrong."

Faking a personality takes scoial skills. If I go into the real world as me then trust me I ain't gonna get anywhere and will just have a miserable time. I really find no enjoyment in socialising with people in general and other similar things - it's pretty boring to me. Those behavior/personality traits don't fit into work related situations. Developing skills wont make a difference because this is my personality, unless I take a different one social skills won't make a difference for me who simply doesn't enjoy socialising.

mentalhealth,fgk6t8s,t1_fgj9aqd,1580858717.0,"No offence but from what I noticed and from experience a huge part of being suicidal is that thinking about the future only makes it worse. A person will see no value in continuing the battle if to them that better will:
A) never end
B) will lead to a war

Suicide does typically involve feeling such as a a lack of hope and it's not like their perspectives can change just like that.  According to the cognitive approach feelings are caused by thoughts - meaning that if you think a certain way you will feel a certain way. Cognitive therapies such as REBT take time (rebt is relatively quick for a therapy) and I think that goes to show that a simple quote like this probably won't make much of a difference to a suicidal person. The quote within itself was probably aimed at a audience of which the majority never struggled with suicide.

I fully agree with the quote now but if someone told me that in the past, I wouldn't have liked it because it would be like someone insisting that the sky is green. I also think that in order for someone to stop being suicidal some kind of action/change needs to happen e.g. therapy. However we need to take the fact that some individuals have limited options that prevent them from receiving help. I do believe that there is hope for everyone (only exception IMO= people who are terminally ill and have lost physical control over their bodies ), just that for some people it will be really difficult. 


NOTE: While I have mentioned the cognitive approach, I am not determining it to be the only cause of suicidal thoughts/intentions/suicide/mental health issues. It just made sense to mention it in this context. This whole comment is just my opinion and may be biased/subjective.

Not suicidal type of bad but mental break down and complete misery level of bad. In one of my notes somewhere I have noted the idea of ""sweet denial"" and honestly the way I go about it and the way I live life combined with the fact that I didn't do anything about it really makes it seem like I'm in denial. I don't like to think about it and not thinking about it is so much easier which is probably where the sweet part of the phrased came from. The reality of it usually hits me at night for some reason.

I been trying to get myself to see a therapist for at least 2-3 years by now I think. I have left the house and walked there in person only to realise that it's Saturday/Sunday and that the gp is closed. I have dialed the number but then chickened out at the last moment. I have told myself ""tomorrow"" so many times. Once I went inside and as soon as I said I wanted to make an appointment the receptionist told me to call back the next day in the morning as otherwise I would have to wait for weeks. The number of times that I have told myself at night "" tomorrow I will call, it will finally be the day"" is countless and so is the prep work I did to go the the appointment so that I know what to say. So that my mind doesn't go blank and so that I can explain it somehow. But for some reason I just haven't been able to get myself to go and at this point I'm not sure if I will ever be able to. I have to, I should but at the same time I just don't know. I thought about it a lot and honestly the idea of going in and getting told ""yes you have this issue"" is terrifying. Like I know that whenever it's diagnosed or not doesn't change whenever it's here or not... And I see how irrational and stupid that is but it just isn't easy.
