Then, my mother died. That led to a suicide attempt earlier this year and I survived. After I got out of the hospital, I figured it was time to actually meet my father as a 22 year old man. I got a bus ticket across the country to go and meet him. Once I met him and got to where we were staying, it was apparent that he lied to me. He told me he had a house and a car on a Native American Reservation, which wasn't true at all. We stayed at his friend's apartment and shared a small bedroom, which belonged to his friend's daughter. That lasted for a week. Then we got an apartment, and it was the most run-down, rat-infested drug haven of a place you could ever imagine. Super thin walls, so you could hear all sorts of shit going on. Not 2 days later, he gets a hooker he knew from another state to move in, and pays for her bus ticket. She was obviously brain damaged from all the drugs she's taken over her whole life, because she could barely form a sentence most of the time. He spent almost all his money on that ticket and we went a few days without food because of it. He also cut off the friend we were living with, so now we were basically alone in the city, knowing nobody. 

Then, one night, he gets really drunk. Like, belligerent drunk. He's wondering why I'm so depressed all the time and I tell him it's because I survived a suicide attempt just a few weeks ago and I still struggle with my mental health. He then gets to the point where he starts screaming at me, threatening to have me permanently institutionalized, and dares me to attempt suicide again. He begins cursing my deceased mother's name, and I managed to keep my composure and not knock him out when he did that. He then offers me a religious mercy killing. ""If you really want to die, I'll kill you, so you can go to heaven and be with your mother."" That's when I called the cops, and got a bus ticket back home the next day. 

Apparently he just got out of rehab, and he's really sorry for what he did. But I'm not buying it. It's not normal to threaten to murder your own son."
