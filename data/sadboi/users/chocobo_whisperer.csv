Anxiety,foetlnh,t3_g6u4dj,1587714312.0,"Thank you for saying this, really needed to hear this todayðŸ’–"
Anxiety,fo2pk59,t3_g587ro,1587470656.0,"I used to self medicate with weed for years for my anxiety. At first, it really helped me relax and get through my panic attacks. But then I started noticing how agitated I would be if I wasnâ€™t high and it really affected my job and my day to day relationships. After that, it started making me paranoid and I would have panic attacks at least 2 to 3 times a week, which sometimes resulted me going to the ER because I thought I was dying. I made the decision to stop smoking weed and drinking caffeine after that and seek professional help for my anxiety/depression. The withdrawals were horrible (I ended up losing 10 pounds and literally couldnâ€™t sleep) but it was the best decision Iâ€™ve made for my mental/physical health. I finally feel like I have control over my anxiety, Iâ€™m way more confident in myself and Iâ€™m back to the person I used to be."
HealthAnxiety,fnx6s8s,t1_fnx5iw9,1587332599.0,"Thank you so much, Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s just my deodorant or something easy to fix. Iâ€™ll try switching!"
HealthAnxiety,fnx6muq,t1_fnvzoma,1587332515.0,"Because of the pandemic, I canâ€™t go into see a doctor, only phone appointments."
HealthAnxiety,fnx6j77,t1_fnw7atk,1587332456.0,"Iâ€™m not left handed, Iâ€™m right handed actually. Iâ€™m not sure why my lymph node is swollen, itâ€™s so odd."
HealthAnxiety,fnvfekb,t1_fnvf7eh,1587291253.0,"Definitely not ringworm, Iâ€™ve checked my armpit in the bathroom and thereâ€™s no red mark or anything. It almost feels likes itâ€™s in my muscle or lymph node but Iâ€™m not sure."
PanicAttack,fnkqr0u,t1_flwjk7m,1587037108.0,"Thank you for suggesting that, I just practiced it for 10 minutes and it really helped get my breathing under control <3 You donâ€™t know how much I appreciate it!"
HealthAnxiety,fnkpn0r,t3_g24kbw,1587036037.0,"Thank you so much for the advice, Iâ€™m definitely gonna try this before I go to sleep. I made a phone appointment with a doctor tomorrow to get some advice because for some reason, I feel like I canâ€™t breathe as deeply as I could on a regular basis. I donâ€™t think I have the corona virus, but itâ€™s kind of freaking me out and Iâ€™ve been having to use my emergency inhaler more then I would like to :("
HealthAnxiety,fnjumnb,t3_g24kbw,1587007376.0,Literally me right now. Iâ€™ve been hyper focused on my breathing all day and itâ€™s horrible :( Any tips for getting your breathing back to normal?
HealthAnxiety,fndbtrx,t3_g11s2d,1586865859.0,"Thatâ€™s awesome!!! Thereâ€™s nothing better then getting lost in a new book :3 Also tea really helps me calm down, especially peppermint tea, give it a try if you have any around! Lemme know if you ever need anything, Iâ€™m always here <3"
Anxiety,fndal6d,t3_g12wnp,1586864764.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re experiencing this :( Have you ever tried meditating before? I use an app called Calm and that really helps me calm down and focus less on physical symptoms. Also reading a book and drinking tea really helps me get out of my own head, highly recommend it! I hope you feel better and just know that youâ€™re not alone <3"
Anxiety,fndabxy,t3_g13n2o,1586864527.0,"The same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago! My lymph node under my jaw/on my neck was swollen and the doctor said I was fighting off some type of infection and prescribed me antibiotics for a week. It got better after that, but my health anxiety still has been at an all time high. Just know that youâ€™re not alone and we are going to get through this difficult time. Hang in there, please reach out if you ever want to talk <3"
HealthAnxiety,fnda1kq,t3_g11s2d,1586864258.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™ve been experiencing this, itâ€™s kind of our worst hell going through this pandemic right now.

Reading really helps me get out of my own head and focus on something else! If you ever need someone to talk to, Iâ€™m always here :) This will pass and I promise things will get better!"
Anxiety,fn9jmwb,t3_g0ej6m,1586775529.0,"Of course! If you need some support, please feel free to reach out anytime, I know how scary anxiety is and itâ€™s great to have someone to lean on when itâ€™s bad. Plus Iâ€™m usually always up at this time xD If youâ€™re looking for free meditation apps, check out Breathe and Headspace, theyâ€™re really awesome too! Also not sure if youâ€™re a fan of yoga, but my friend referred me to a yoga app thatâ€™s free until May! Itâ€™s called Yoga for Beginners, havenâ€™t tried it out yet, but my friend says it helps her :)"
Anxiety,fn9iljx,t3_g0ej6m,1586774412.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re experiencing this, youâ€™re definitely not alone in this <3 Have you tried meditating before? I use an app called Calm, it has guided meditations for anxiety and it helps me get out of my head. Iâ€™m also trying to incorporate reading before I go to bed to see if that helps, do you have a book youâ€™ve been wanting to read?"
Anxiety,fn9h6ma,t3_g0ej6m,1586772855.0,The same thing has been happening to me. Is it right before you go to bed? My anxiety usually gets bad right before I try to sleep and itâ€™s obviously gotten worse because of the pandemic.
Anxiety,fn9gw1z,t3_g0fc9x,1586772526.0,"Itâ€™s different for everyone, but after going to my doctor and psychiatrist, Iâ€™ve been on Remeron regularly for my anxiety and I have klonopin for when Iâ€™m having a panic attack for about a year now. If youâ€™re unable to go a doctor right now, I highly recommend getting Yogi brand Kava Stress Relief Tea for when youâ€™re feeling anxious and taking melatonin at night to help you sleep. Also Iâ€™ve been using an app called Calm, it has guided meditations for anxiety and it really helps me when Iâ€™m feeling uneasy. I really hope I was able to help, feel free to reach out if you need anything :)"
Anxiety,fn6ay3h,t3_fzvow6,1586693966.0,"Youâ€™re not alone in this, I feel the exact same way. My anxiety is all over the place now (especially because I have asthma and Iâ€™m SOO anxious about catching the virus and not being able to breathe) and it sucks. If you ever need someone to talk to, Iâ€™m always here <3"
Anxiety,fn69wmr,t3_fzvdol,1586692959.0,"Youâ€™re not alone, my anxiety has completely consumed me and itâ€™s horrible :( I hate not working or having any ounce of my normal day to day life. I have asthma and every couple of days I feel like I canâ€™t breathe normally and it leads into a huge anxiety attack in the middle of the night. Itâ€™s the worst."
Anxiety,fn6841j,t3_fztnmh,1586691114.0,"Iâ€™m feeling the exact same way as you, youâ€™re definitely not alone. Literally in the midst of a panic attack because I thought I was breathing abnormally (I have asthma and Iâ€™m always worried that Iâ€™ve somehow got the virus and wonâ€™t be able to breathe) and itâ€™s the worst :( I canâ€™t wait until this whole pandemic is over, itâ€™s completely fucked up my anxiety."
HealthAnxiety,ezg579s,t1_ezewahw,1567891623.0,"Thank you dood, best of luck to you too :)"
HealthAnxiety,ezcgxzc,t1_ezcegw1,1567834929.0,"Honestly I quit smoking marijuana because it was causing me to have more frequent heart palpitations (especially after the ER visit) and it simply wasnâ€™t working for me anymore, I used to love it though D: I feel like self medicating was just suppressing all of the anxiety and problems I didnâ€™t want to face and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s all bubbling to the surface now. I really hope I can see a therapist soon though and work through my issues, I just want to be happy again."
HealthAnxiety,ezcbyvj,t1_ezc8s3z,1567832837.0,"Thank you so much, Iâ€™m definitely looking into a therapist within my area, Iâ€™ve been wanting to see one for years and think itâ€™s time. And Iâ€™m for sure gonna check out The Honest Guys tonight before I go to sleep! :)"
HealthAnxiety,ezc6uee,t3_d0pdja,1567830763.0,"Iâ€™ve had IBS since I was 18 and itâ€™s literally the worst, Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re dealing with this :( Are you on any sort of medication to treat it currently? I take Imodium every day to treat mine and try my best to stay away from greasy/fatty foods and itâ€™s been helping a lot."
