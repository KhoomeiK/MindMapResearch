mentalhealth,eqxq7o4,t3_bzmpzh,1560372603.0,"Hyperventilating:
Ask them to breath in an small bag until to point the oxygen runs out. That should do it.

What you can do:
Breath 4 seconds in. Hold about 2 sec and then release in 6 sec.
Of course you can change the amount of seconds,  what works for you.

Panic:
Ask them if they ever were in an real danger.
The adrenaline that they felt, hart, shacking ect is your body's response in order for survival . Flight, drop or fight.
Normally this adrenaline last for a couple of minutes,  while you're in real danger. 

While having panic or anxiety,  you're brain thinks you're in real danger.  Being killed or getting an accident. 
BUT, the adrenaline release can last for hours, days or weeks.

Ask them to think of the moment when they indeed felt the adrenaline, and if they could imagine how it's like to have this for hours, for no reason,  you know of course, you're not crazy. This is your brain giving wrong signals.  Its an illness.  And not your fault.  Of course you don't this on purpose,  why would you?"

Try doing something, one thing like a shower or washing dishes.  Be proud that you did it, and allow the bad day for happening. Don't fight it. It will happen anyway so let it happen.

This will pass. 
When you accept it, you will notice that the pressure is going down,  and that this day might be not completely awfully as you thought. 
Sometimes you lose yourself in your head, and you drown in this negative feeling.
