Anyways, I re-downloaded the app 2 weeks ago and matched with this guy. Right off the bat I was very intrigued by our conversation and quite (shallowly?) attracted to him physically. Our first date was last week and it went extremely well. Emphasis on extremely. We seem to be hitting it off in a way I haven’t connected with somebody in a long time. We’re hanging out again tomorrow and I’m super excited. 
 
I guess it’s safe to say I’m catching feelings for this guy but what if it’s moving too fast? I keep telling myself it’s okay, especially considering I’ve been in the dating scene for some time and I should be grateful I’ve found somebody I really like! But that’s all.. I’m happy."
