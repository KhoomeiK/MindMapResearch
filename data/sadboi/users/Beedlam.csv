One day i sat and concentrated on my breath and in about 30 seconds  had a feeling of extreme sadness followed by an intense panic attack featuring extreme derealisation that lasted hours. In the following year my panic returned and included a new and severe derealisation component with it. I don't meditate anymore but wish i could, i was appreciating the calmness and clarity that it was leading me to.

I personally know someone who had a very similar experience to me but ended up detaching completely and spent some time in a psychward.

This is someone who takes the temperature of a room when ever she enters and dumps anxiety on people shes close to at all times and becomes more anxious the more in a relationship she is. Like it can be difficult to have a conversation as they become very one sided as she disappears into people pleasing.

By the third year of high school i was in a remedial English class for kids that couldn't keep up as i'd spent most of the first term refusing to work, and was reading books in class instead. That same year i was one of two kids in my year who scored in the highest brackets of a national English exam/competition thing. I spent the rest of my time at my three different high schools stoned out of my gourd. Got expelled a few times, didn't finish. Not once did anyone ask me what was going on even when i was pulled up for being baked at school or falling asleep in class. Left home at 15 and by 17 i was severely depressed and underweight due to spending most of my money on drugs. 

I did a couple of certificates and cruised through an IT career with minimal study as studying enterprise IT is possibly the dullest thing i can think of and just slightly worse than doing it for a living. Picked most of it up as i went along and ended up as one of those seemingly well compensated contractor types. Quit due to hating office life and the grind. Still hoping to pick a new direction but haven't been able to settle on something yet, what ever it is it won't be corporate or 9-5. I'd rather cast myself in concrete, as that was what it felt like i was doing with that work anyway.

I have struggled with a pretty bad learning capacity, often gave up if something didn't come naturally and flit between tasks and hobbies a lot. I'm better with this but still not great and don't understand where it came from (i'd like to know, sometimes it's been unbearable how uncomfortable it is not flowing with a task). I know i was chronically shamed from the earliest of ages and didn't have consistent support, or any after a time.

uBlockOrigin,fkqlhci,t1_fkqgvlb,1584449538.0,They have a 5mb limit on images. Thats good i guess. Load times are between 4 and 10 seconds per image for me just checking that link now. Connection is 40mb wireless to 100mb fiber. I'm sure i've seen much worse but it's good (and bad) that its probabyl specific to me and my computer.

How would i report it to github?"
bikewrench,fkdjfom,t1_fkdja2b,1584081119.0,Thanks i've got a funny feeling it might be the steerer tube. I'll check that next time.

Volvo,fk25xzl,t1_fk0l1f5,1583793846.0,"Stupid expensive hacks were the options i was being given by the audio shop. They were keenest on installing a separate head unit and wiring it up to amp, then splicing it into the steering controls and waterfall etc.. It would have been a mess. 

Does anyone have experience with these units?

There's more, they seem to be the same oem rebrands, possibly the same as Yatour. From what i've seen its down to one of those or a GROM."

CPTSD,fjn20i5,t1_fjln62b,1583494968.0,"How is this not common knowledge for cptsd folks? 

It is absolutely control, abusive control. Like all control it stems from a lack of control/anxiety but it's the externalised, and it is so fucking common its absurd. 

My example: Older brother was very controlling of me. There's many reasons for this that i don't need to go into but one of the ways it manifested was him telling me how to do things all the time we were together. It was awful to be around as it ment i often couldn't relax without fear of being made wrong or getting raged at if i didn't get something right/say the right thing/manage his reactions etc. So i'd be walking on eggshells most of the time. It became so unbearable i ghosted him a few years ago, which fucking sucks if i'm honest with myself. 

My mother and father were both very controlling and imo it sets up a feeling of being missed as a person. You're thing to be controlled, not a person to be seen, respected and cared for. I've known this for years, worked with it in therapy, and it can still leave me feeling absolutely horrible when i experience it.  The feeling is like a sickness of rage, its absolutely pathological.

I am at a place where i've had a few defensive explosions against controlling abusive types, which while not ideal, i'm happy they even happened as it's better than adding it to the sack of abuses i didn't know i was carrying. They still caused a lot of rumination however. 

I want to get to a place where when i can, you know, be like a person who developed solid boundaries early in life, can spot toxic people, and either navigate around them or present a proper defense if that's not possible...and not have that have such an impact on me if i do need to defend myself.

bikewrench,fi07muu,t1_fi06gf3,1582029344.0,I don't think i'll be able to find one like that. Is there any other way to do it? Would it be such an issue to have some lose cable housing? The cable would still move and the housing would keep it off the frame.

AdultChildren,fhgzicz,t3_f304xo,1581586507.0,"I have choices? 

Umm sticking around in abusive relationships/friendships i guess. But i've shown them since i got help and can actually feel when somethings fucked.. i've cut everyone out and now am hyper vigilant to anything that might be intimacy.. because it might be enmeshment and codependency and i might stick around while people start being controlling and abusive again.
