The address Google review has someone staying 'its a haven for bed bugs' from like 4 months ago ( I imagine they just left instead of pushing for extermination ). I'm imagining it's in the walls, other tenants buildings, ect. The landlord doesn't care about the apartment or the tenants at all, and will likely out up a fight to avoid paying for professional treatment, especially the more expensive, surround units treatments."

The landlord said he was a friend of his. I had to leave the apartment both times, so never got to see anything. Anyway, he's not registered and now I need to contact the city inspectors again to tell them they need to force the landlord to treat it but with a registered Exterminator, this time I'll check with the registry before he or she comes. If I can't get a hold of the city inspectors I'm kinda fucked, as they are the one that can legally force the landlord to do it. ( The office is closed and I've been trying to reach the agent with my file )

The other part of me is considering breaking the lease, and just doing my best to not take it with me. Either option is going to be hard.

So pissed at the lying rat bastard landlord, I don't even want to pay rent in this shit. It's not like they can evict me since the covid laws prevent them. Maybe if I can't reach the city inspectors I can refuse payment until they properly treat my unit and the surround units."
