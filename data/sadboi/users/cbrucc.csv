I think the real issue is she thinks I was being deceptive because ""I could get away with it""  which plays in to trust which I completely understand.

When K has take work trips I'm ALWAYS the one watching her since we began going out. I have no problem doing this because I love our time together. We draw, play video games, watch movies, read, get some pizza; anything that has a ample amount of cheese her daughter is all about. I love that little girl too death and more in never going to see her or K again."
relationship_advice,fhzeqpz,t1_fhzdu6b,1581997608.0,"I'm sorry as write this my head spinning. She explicitly said no ""smoking"" in the house. I don't smoke traditional I use a Mighty vaporizer which is basically like a mini oven that heats the bud up. Her issues is I exhaled while massaging her because she thought I was being deceptive. Reality is I just smoked to much and effects hit me hard. I honestly didn't even realize I did. I know head massages relax her and just wanted to make her feel good. She has some issues with anxiety and that can sometimes help alleviate them. 

I got rid of all the bud I had, vaporizer and whatever relating to it. In hopes to show K that and her daughter are my priority above all else.

I'm completely drained, I don't know what else to do. I feel like such a fuck up. Just losing my family, the one thing that me happy. Coming home to them at the end of the day just made everything better.

Now I lost everything my family, my love and I have nowhere to stay besides my car which is on its last leg."

Since then it's bounced around I was able to get off at for a little bit nothing long term. There's really nothing else that it gives an immediate help when I'm having bad flares.
