On top of the financial stress, my mother is a malicious narcissistic who goes out of her way to do harm.

There are plenty of insecure people out there who tend to gravitate towards even more insecure people. Just from a personal perspective account, I can tell you that I have had a few relationships over the years wherein I eventually was forced into getting help at some point, and it absolutely made the guys I was with at those times feel threatened in a significant way.

Some people cannot function without someone who looks to them more often than not for guidance and support. Sure, there are legitimately good people out there who will be with you *despite* your mental illness, and then there are the ""fixers"" who will be with you *because* of your mental illness and their desire to ""fix"" ""broken"" people (these people often tend to play the victim in the majority of interactions in their life, as well), in addition to controlling and insecure individuals who will use your mental illness to convince themselves that they are more powerful and important than they really are, based solely on their personal relationship dynamic with you.

Paranoia is literally excessive suspicion with nonsensical reasoning. Literally.


par·a·noi·a

/ˌperəˈnoiə/

noun

a mental condition characterized by delusions of persecution, unwarranted jealousy, *or exaggerated self-importance*, **typically elaborated into an organized system**. It may be an aspect of chronic personality disorder, of drug abuse, or of a serious condition such as schizophrenia in which the person loses touch with reality.

Similar:

persecution complex

delusions

obsession

megalomania

monomania

psychosis

**suspicion and mistrust of people or their actions without evidence or justification.**



If you cannot see that the actual definition of paranoia applies more and more each time you comment about this very situation, then I don't know how you've made it this far in life. But, what do I know? You could have locked yourself in your room, wearing a tin-foil hat and marinating in all of the reasons you come up with as to why it's not you who is fucked up, no... it's definitely other people. 


If you have been on Reddit for even a week without  an exchange similar to what happened a few days ago, then I would say you have never actually taken the time to read through the comments a bit on pretty much any post. However, though I am no long-standing, reddit og veteran, I will say that never have I ever been *suspected* of the incredibly specific offense I stand accused of by you. I have experienced similar interactions, though it was in real life...always with someone who was either not on their mental health medications, or had done excessive amounts of drugs. My deductive reasoning tells me that in this instance, one of those 2 factors are at play. I do not, cannot, understand any other reasoning behind the madness at play here. 


While you're incredibly off-putting, I am no monster and am legitimately worried about everyone involved at this point. I have resources that you can take advantage of to help get you back on track and in touch with reality. Just pm me anytime, and I will be happy to help. Of not me, then someone-- anyone who can just help guide you towards rationality and on the road to recovery. Good luck, and hope to hear from you."

I saw a couple of things that stood out, as they were recent and quite obviously an argument, and I got curious. I came here and read back to where I think it began between you guys, and was incredibly amused while also definitely disagreeing with everything you said, as it was trite and really stereotypical in pretty much every way.


So... Yeah, there was no 'remembering an argument from last night and chiming in the next day' (or however you worded that).


Though, if it would make you feel better and somehow justify/validate/pacify your own skewed view of the world to believe that this is all some conspiracy, that's exactly what you'll do. So, you do you, boo. Though it seems to me that you should probably talk to someone about paranoia and delusions being  symptoms of something bigger."

I have 3 sons and I hate that they have to see me like this, and I don't know wtf I would do if they were covered in scabs like me. Though, they all bite their fingernails, which I have never done. I worry enough about that, I can't imagine them with excoriation. My heart truly goes out to you.


Thank you so much for the kind and supportive words. You have no idea how much they mean."

Excoriation,fmx0e2u,t1_fmwxt01,1586456226.0,"You're right about everything. The cycle is awful and relentless.


I understand about scabs in your head, even though for whatever reason, I haven't picked my scalp in years. I still search quite a lot for little things to scratch in my head, but I don't do it often enough for it to be a problem. But, growing up, I had scabs in my head all the time ever since I can remember. It is really difficult to stop that area specifically, because it is ""hidden"" as well as difficult to carry out treatment rituals with. I am truly sorry that you have to deal with this disorder, bc I wouldn't wish it on anyone.


I really hope you can keep your positive attitude and your strength going until you gain absolute control, 100% of the time and this will only be something from your past.


Please accept some well wishes, good vibes, and this 🦄 as thanks for taking the time to talk to me."
Excoriation,fmwwbai,t1_fmwmmii,1586454173.0,"You hit the nail on the head with ""planning your day around healing your scabs"".


In the past, I have gotten things under control by doing just that. Every time I wanted to pick, I would just force myself to be realistic about what I was doing to myself and remember how happy and proud I am when my face is smooth and even, not covered in scabs that embarrass me and my kids, and make people immediately assume I am a strung out addict.


I would just gather lots of supplies and use those awful realizations to urge me on to spend time taking care of my sores in some way. After seeing results just from a day/night, it surged me forward.


Though, I always have at least one spot on my body that I keep ready to pick for when I get the urge. My main issue is getting it under control, i.e.: avoiding my face and neck/chest/shoulders getting noticeably disfigured. The problem is that when I go through episodes like this, it feels literally impossible to do anything about it because of the way I feel. I feel like I really, consciously, would rather reap the consequences bc the gratification/relief/soothing I get from it is worth it at this point. Sometimes I have my switch to deciding I'm ready to get things under control and that I don't **NEED** it anymore gets flipped relatively quickly, other times things just get completely out of control and it takes weeks and weeks for that switch to flip.


I have no idea how to make myself change my state of mind to that of a healing and healthier mentality, or frame of thought willingly. I don't know if it's possible. I feel that what is said about addicts or anyone, ""nothing at all can be done if they don't *want* to change/get better; they have to *want* to do it for themselves."" applies here.


It's like I have something attached to me that just won't let me go, and I have to just obey its will for control over me until it gets tired or bored enough to let go and I can finally see clearly again and think for myself."
misophonia,fmwtz54,t1_fml8qi5,1586452997.0,"I can feel all of this on such a soul-crushing level.


So many things trigger me, but I know that much of it is avoidable-- especially when I bring attention to the to certain things constantly and eventually end up going crazy because the only thing I can do to calm myself down is to create physical distance between the trigger and myself.


The horrible catch is that the people responsible for the triggers are my own children. The older two are the biggest sources of trigger noises for me (they are 8 and 13). I know it is awful to feel like this about my own kids, but I cannot help it.


It was bad before, and distracted me, angered/enraged me and made me retreat to the solitude of the bathroom quite often. But, now... in quarantine?? Fml, fr.


I want to spend quality time with them and be productive with their online school work and mine as well, but sounds (even certain movements/behaviors that are repetitive or otherwise incredibly agitating-- no idea if physical actions/certain physical reactions or even just certain textures, have anything to do with this specific disorder or if it is something else all together) create such uncontrollable anger in me that I end up snapping and avoiding the situation.


There are certain times when, though I am very aware and thoroughly annoyed by something, I can consciously remind myself to project a calm and unbothered version of myself. I grew up, and still deal with, a mom and step-dad(s) that were always annoyed at best, or screaming about how annoying and worthless I am. I have worked on myself with huge amounts of effort and persistence in order to be nothing like the people who ""raised"" me. So, usually, I can internalize my reactions to these things when it comes to my kids. I had my moments, but still.


However, since being around them in a very cramped environment 24/7, I have started to just emotionally spiral into oblivion. My reactions to triggers have always been worse during times of emotional distress and heightened anxiety & stress.


Right now, on top of being in close proximity to my family nonstop, I am having significant financial problems, I am dealing with a really fucked up custody situation with a fucking delusional drug dealer/addict/paranoid conspiracy theorist, I am in the process of moving, am being harassed/stalked by an ex of 2 years ago, and I am trying to deal with my mother's increasing and all-consuming mental illness (I strongly suspect some type of bipolar [I have schizoaffective bipolar disorder that is under as much control as possible with treatment and medication] because not only is it genetic, I just have a lot of personal experience and am a clinical psych student) and have given her the ultimatum to either start getting professional help* or I cut all contact as the whole relationship is just toxic.


I know, this is a long post, but venting through writing has helped in the past, and I am trying to get this shit out of me, even if it only provides temporary relief."

So, like, did he just slow down and finish 6 minutes too slow, or did he drop to the ground (unconscious? No? Why did he fall down?) and then get back up and finish the race?
