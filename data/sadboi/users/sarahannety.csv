One day we were at her house having dinner and she spotted a toy soldier on the floor that one of the grandkids had dropped. She asked my ex to pass her it and he picked it up and tossed it towards her in a lazy, half jokey way.
As it sailed over her head she looked him dead in the eye and said 'howay! I'd have more chance of catching syphilis than catching that!' 

I actually choked on my tea at the time and it still makes me laugh now, two years down the line.

This is not about you, this is about her, and if you weren't prepared for this then you shouldn't have adopted. 

Her biological family did not abandon her or throw her away, they loved her and were unable to care for her and made a heartbreaking decision to give her up for her to have a better life. They just want to meet this child they didn't get to raise and I would say that is their right. Similarly, your daughter gets to know where she came from and have questions about that part of her identity answered.

I would also encourage you to read your own words back, you talk about having fed her, clothed her etc. I'm sorry, but that does not make you a hero (nor does taking a child from a 'underdeveloped' country) it makes you a parent. You can't buy people and just because you have 'spoiled' your daughter that doesn't mean you own her.
