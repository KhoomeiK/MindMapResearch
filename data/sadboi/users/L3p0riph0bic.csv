Fantasy,fh8ghzu,t3_f1pllg,1581359235.0,The whole Earthsea series.  Seeing Le Guin’s characters in very different stages of life and with different goals and core values and how they relate to each other was huge in changing how I empathize with others.

mentalhealth,f33ecwj,t1_f33aubb,1570637024.0,I agree.  I also think a big part is having people you trust that can help you check your gut.
SupermodelCats,f2g4wtr,t3_ddb6h0,1570226591.0,I mostly lurk here but I want you to know your brother’s cat is majestic.  Also great name.

leagueoflegends,euxnpg5,t1_euwylfg,1564089615.0,Did he mention how they track and rate unforced errors?  Are they looking just at what cost them a game during a day-after review session or are they combing footage for unforced errors in a deeper sweep?

mentalhealth,esw0s5a,t3_c9cbxb,1562307411.0,I’m really sorry you feel so bad you want to kill yourself.   I don’t know much about your situation but as a former homeschool kid I know the transition can be really hard and awkward.    I’ve wanted to end my life before and felt that despair.  I really recommend you contact your local suicide hotline too.  They can help you a lot of ways.
