Like you rightly said there is no point in forcing yourself to sit for x minutes, instead meditate for however long you feel like. That way you're not feeling guilty for not having achieved anything from the session.

Make it a habit to meditate daily even if you get bored, it can be as short as 5 minutes or a long session like 30 minutes. This way you'll maintain your consistency and you;ll actually enjoy it and it won't seem like too much work."
