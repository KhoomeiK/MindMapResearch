I think the little details of sexual things the characters notice or think about actually make the writing good. Those are the things real people in the real world actually think and notice, even if it may seem pervy or unnecessary, it’s reality. People are gross and pervy and sexualize others a lot but that’s what makes the characters so dynamic and convincing."

depression,fpoxi79,t3_gea6mo,1588792355.0,"I think this is a common issue with depressed people. Our seclusion from our own identities or the lack of connection is more obvious to others than ourselves. When you barely can connect with your own personality or identity, it’s no surprise that others can’t connect with you in a “best friend” type of way. The worst part is the loneliness and exclusion you feel because of this just makes you feel worse and worse. It’s just another aspect of the torturous and cyclical pattern of depression."
