UCSantaBarbara,fj5sbhe,t1_fj19bzx,1583041438.0,"Another UCSC undergrad here. Santa Cruz is filled with racist and greedy landlords. This is something that affects both undergrads and grads. They keep raising rent and make finding off campus housing extremely difficult. Here are some more points of contention against COLA -

1) There's a general fear that, if COLA is granted, there's nothing stopping landlords from simply raising rent again. Graduate students may be able to cope, but what about undergrads?

2) Despite all that, COLA protestors have done nothing to take the fight to the city. In fact they very happily celebrated when the Santa Cruz city council passed a resolution urging UCSC to grant a COLA. The same geriatrics who do turn the other way and do nothing to combat rampant rent increase.

3) The strike had a bad start. The first day was full of incidents like people trying to kick cars passing entrances, climbing loop busses and shaming undergrads for passing the line, ganging up on a student in a car trying to leave the campus with his kids. They did apologize, but it turned some people away anyway.

4) I'm not sure if you have already heard of this, but a COLA group recently invaded a midterm. They entered the classroom, They shamed students for crossing the picket line and giving their midterm and shouted chants for about 10 mins in the classroom before leaving. They claimed to not know a midterm was going on, but videos clearly show them chanting ""This is not just about tests"", ""we stop grades if we stop fling tests"".

5) A group known as 'The People's Coalition' has recently been endorsed by the COLA movement. They published a document with a few ridiculous and unrealistic demands like abolish tuition and free food. This delegitimized the movement further. 

I've also heard that some TAs outright refused to publish grades even when students requested them? I cannot personally verify any of those claims.

While r/UCSC does have a lot of hate fueled Stem students who think their major is superior, I still think u/QueenCharla heavily generalised CS students. Not all of them spew vitriol for no reason.

As for support. There is a sizeable group of people against the strike. I'm a pure science /Phil major, and I've spoken to friends, profs and TAs in my dept. A lot of people were turned away by the behavior of the movement itself. A lot of them think they're targeting the wrong people. A lot of them are upset that they're hurting undergrads even when they say they won't. My professors do not support the strike. My TAs in math and phy classes are in support of a COLA, but are very heavily against the strike, it's methods and the mob itself.

Some are in support but discouraged by what the movement has become. People in my science media club are supportive but have had bad experiences with the strikers. I've also talked to STEM people in full support of the strike and on the other hand classmates in Phil who absolutely hate the strike and COLA because of canceled classes and sections. 

So who's the majority? Idk. I don't run statistics. But there is definitely a group of people against the strike. They don't speak up because they fear ridicule, or just don't want to be involved in general. I personally don't support them. Mainly because of their methods and that they co-opted the Save Mauna Kea movement which I'm personally very against, but that's just me. But at the end a bunch of us just feel caught in the middle of firefight and are desperately wanting to get out."
