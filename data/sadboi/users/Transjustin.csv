stimuluscheck,fnietyi,t1_fni46wc,1586978791.0,I had to do a non filers because I had been claimed on 2018 returns and my father never submitted 2019 but we don’t talk like that anymore so I’m not a dependent anymore so I had to make it known I wasn’t. We will see how it works. All I know is I’m going to be pissed if I don’t get it. My parents don’t support me and I live with my girl. I just hope I didn’t fuck it up
disability,fni1u10,t3_f8scqw,1586972548.0,In the same boat. Got “married” to my “wife” last year. We just had a ceremony and didn’t file anything legal. As long as you aren’t legally married you are fine. I was engaged for a year and found out I couldn’t get married. Now that broke my heart. Then we decided it doesn’t matter what the govt says. Yes there are benefits we don’t get but then I wouldn’t get my benefits which we need. It’s a comprise but no one knows except the close people around us so it makes me happy!
stimuluscheck,fnhxdj3,t3_g1rl34,1586970437.0,"Anyone else on disability having this issue? I mean I clearly DO NOT make enough as my only income is my disability and that is aroun $15,000 a year..."
stimuluscheck,fnhwhas,t3_g1q1fx,1586970010.0,"I’m on disability. I was claimed back in 2018, but had to claim myself this year so I would get it. 2019 I wasn’t going to be claimed but also wasn’t submitted. I did a non filet even tho they say not to for disability but I had to so that they knew I wasn’t a dependent bc I have been my whole life and receive adult child disability. Like I’m waiting for it so I can get food. My animals need food. Now I’m worried I ain’t gettin shit :/"
ftm,fnbskyo,t3_g0kh3w,1586821490.0,"Wow this is my mom too lol. She doesn’t care about other people being trans, but when I came out she told me I would be a freak and would never find love... and that she could never look at me if I grew facial hair because it would disgust her. Well now Ive been on T over 2 years and had top surgery almost 2 years ago. And I’m married and hardly have a relationship with them now because I’m not down with transphobia."
bipolar,fmyyfzs,t1_fmyy35p,1586499784.0,I’m just so scared. 28 or so meds now and nothing works. It can work short term but they do more damage then good. I get so numb I start self harming or trying to die. So I’m off all my meds but my klonopin and when that runs out I could die from withdrawals. Of course this happens now when all of the psychs are closed bc of the virus here in New York :/
bipolar,fm1vn68,t1_flygbgl,1585685825.0,Sometimes it feels like can’t have our own emotions because people want to put us into a box. It sucks because everyone is entitled to be emotional but because we have bipolar disorder we are looked at as ill every time we show any signs of emotion.
bipolar,fm1vd5s,t1_flxqmyw,1585685686.0,"If I’m clearly manic and could possibly be a danger to myself. I would appreciate someone close to me to tell me hey I’m getting worried about you. But when you aren’t manic, or you don’t really know the person but they are just assuming you are manic that’s what pisses me off. Everyone is so quick to say “ you must be manic” or “you must be depressed” when I do literally anything. It’s like I’m not allowed to have a normal emotional reaction without someone being quick to say “oh he’s manic again.” If I am a danger and someone is being genuinely worried about me then i won’t be mad. Also depends on the way they aproach me with it. If someone just says you manic. No I’m gonna be mad. If someone is like” I’m getting worried about you” then I will talk to them and hear them out!"
bipolar,fm1nkcd,t1_flxomso,1585681661.0,"No! You are not allowed to be happy! How dare you think you can actually be happy and not manic you are bipolar! 
Literally everyone ever when they find out you gots bipolar and are either happy or upset because of a completely normal reason. Smh"
bipolar,fkmd36x,t1_fkk10wi,1584326116.0,My pdoc keeps saying I wouldn’t qualify despite multiple suicide attempts and being on disability. Saying that they need to use medicine after ect regardless so if I were to do it I would have to do it every month or multiples times a month. Sounded too intense for me. I have been begging him to look into ect for me. How does it work for you? Do you have to go in that frequently? I just want to feel better!!! 28 meds and nothing works!!!!
Instagram,fkmcuwi,t1_fkkf211,1584325963.0,And the one person who is in their mid 20s was having problems with her account so it must have been some minors trying to visit my page. Wow you saved me from a heart attack!
Instagram,fkmcoix,t1_fkkf211,1584325845.0,great thanks so much for the help! I was worried it was some sort of a ban but that’s good because I’m not trying to sell any smoking accessories to minors anyways!
Instagram,fkjm6q8,t3_fiwk2y,1584250425.0,Also wanted to note I deleted the tracker and all and changed my password when I was told people were having trouble finding me. I also have had friends make their friends check. They found me. It’s just some people. Is this some sort of a ban? One of the girls who received my products to promote and she can’t even find me and she is not blocked so it’s just very weird.
doordash_drivers,fibwid1,t1_fibcq7v,1582331791.0,"Exactly! Like I’m just as likely to get into an accident on my free time while I’m driving. I like in NY!!! People drive like maniacs! You just gotta hope you don’t get hit or knocked off the road by an asshole everyday! I’m not any less focused while dashing. Accidents happen, hence why it’s called an accident..."
electronic_cigarette,fibfqta,t3_f7drot,1582321005.0,"This is in my county. I personally think it’s ridiculous that the government is telling us we can’t smoke in our own private residence. I don’t smoke anymore but still think it’s very controlling. So I’m allowed to have a weapon in my home that I could use to shoot and kill somebody, but I’m not allowed to smoke in my own home? Seems like we aren’t focused on the big issues."
doordash_drivers,fib83pt,t1_fib7q02,1582316538.0,Yeah I’m confused about this too. Is it bad for insurance or something to be doordashing and get in a accident?
Vape_Porn,fib7oni,t1_fib18mt,1582316300.0,Second this!!! I have seen these quite a bit and have no idea where to get them! I neeeeed!!!!!
ftm,fi9mlqj,t1_fi9lbhw,1582271971.0,Damn. That means I’m gonna have to wait like another year to get it fixed :/ when I first scheduled it was a 6 month wait and now she’s only even more famous :/ I’m literally just going to ask to speak to the woman who always helped me with these things before she moved her practice from the hospital to private. But this woman still works with her and they are all about trans surgeries so if they care at all they should get me in asap and cover it. I was reading her website and it says that they can get revisions covered. Including removing excess fat. So I’ll talk to the head lady tomorrow instead of some secretary that doesn’t know anything about actual surgery lol.
ftm,fi9kyz6,t1_fi9jvj5,1582269922.0,Was your revision in office? She said it would be a simple in office procedure but it looks like she basically needs to fix the whole thing. She thinks it’s just a dog ear and the receptionist wouldn’t give me an email to email pics so I’m calling back tomorrow and I swear I will cry my eyes out to my surgeon until she figures this shit out bc it’s ridiculous at this point. I might have to find someone else who’s willing to do it if she is not
ftm,fi9j8wg,t1_fi9iz36,1582267942.0,I have no idea if she lipod or not. She said she was going to if she needed to. I woke up with the same results I have now. She kept saying it would go away bc it was all swelling. Bitch it ain’t swelling when it’s there for 2 years!! It’s called you gon fucked up and won’t own up to it. I’m calling in the morning right away to tell them it needs to be done. She’s in private practice now so she has the funds to cover it if my insurance won’t. I literally have pain under my arms and can’t rest my arms down completely bc of all the fat!!! It sucks :/ I hate my body now even more than before surgery. I thought it would be freeing yet I feel like I look like something out of the show Botched lol
ftm,fi9ift4,t1_fi9i2u4,1582267059.0,since it’s on them as to why it’s not satisfactory at all in my opinion. The only thing that looks good is the nipples and the scars healed nice but I have like man boobs. I have pictures from 1 month post op and it still looks the same. Is this covered by insurance since I literally am miserable and have been shirtless less than 5 times in 2 years? I literally cry constantly and can’t go out shirtless because it’s so evident. Is the lypo covered since they didn’t do it right? I’m going to call my surgeons secretary tomorrow and send them pictures and tell them it needs to be fixed. If they won’t I will find someone else to help me. I feel disgusting about my body :/
ftm,fi9hf65,t3_f7710r,1582265991.0,"I have very large fat deposits left under each arm pit, as well as a dog ear in the middle of my chest. And whenever I sit down I look like a have b cups. I really don’t understand how someone so famous could botch my surgery like this. I’m going in for a revision in a month but I’m going to call tomorrow and tell them they have to do something with all the fat they left! I’ve only lost weight since surgery!!! Haven’t gained weight at all since."
MacMiller,fenyu9s,t3_eq2si0,1579292803.0,So jealous! Had an appt today so I’m hoping I can go tomorrow. Just gotta drive in but so worth it for the late and great Mac 🙏🏻
SuicideWatch,fedf66g,t1_fec6j49,1579009846.0,"Sweetie, I’ve been in your position and I’m so glad your still here! I have attempted my life multiple times. Rarely is it actually successful. And if it’s not it makes life even harder. I ODed on prescription pills and was in a coma for 3 days and woke up and had to be in the hospital from November till slightly into January. And I was lying there with my cat too. Holding him. I put in my note that my parents had to take care of him and love him the way I did. I’ve been right where you are. You just need to talk to someone about it more and figure out why you are feeling this way. Either there is some issue to work out or maybe medication could help. You are too young to end your life! I thought I would have nothing and would always be unhappy. Now I’m married and I have 5 fur babies that I love to death! I still constantly think about ending my life as I have since I was 7, but I no there are things to live for! Be here for your cat! Be here for your dolls! Be here to live life and realize that things are temporary and life will get better! You have so much love here on this page! Just look at all the support you have! We are always here for you! ❤️"
FTMMen,fededqn,t3_eo8qeh,1579009201.0,And I have dealt with backlash from my wife’s family. Her father did not get me at first and still doesn’t but is more respectful now and is trying to bond over manly things. But for almost 2 years he misgendered me or called me “it” or “the thing.” Yeah shit hurts and I was living with them at the time because my family had kicked me out. So Luckily for you you can come out and if they have issues you can distance yourself from them. They will see that they will hear and see a lot less of their daughter bc of what they are doing and will be more open even if just to have their daughter around. In laws suck whether your trans or not! My wife isn’t trans yet my parents and her had issues for a long time. And her and my sister still do. But hey life goes on and what matters is that your happy and your in love so just appreciate and enjoy that! Say eff you to all the bullshit!
FTMMen,fede2a3,t3_eo8qeh,1579008930.0,"I never had to come out to my wife’s family as I was early in transition so my wife had talked to her parents so they gendered me correctly. But I did have an awful experience of her aunt putting me to other family members. I had never met anyone but my wife’s parents and her grandparents. All of her grandparents love me and don’t care. This aunt decided it was appropriate to stalk my wife (at the time just my girlfriend) even thought they were not friends on Facebook. Through that she found my Facebook and I had some old pictures I hadn’t deleted and she thought it was appropriate to show old pictures of me in dresses at prom and my graduation... like are you effing kidding? I have always had issues with her since and it’s been 3 years. But thank god for my wife’s grandparents! Her grandma was like “well I don’t care I like Justin he’s nice!” 
So long story short it didn’t end up sucking that badly but her aunt and that side of the family treats me like a freak and still misgenders me even at my wedding, meanwhile I have a beard and mustache, so I guess some people just suck at feel it’s their story to tell when it’s not!!"
FTMMen,fe5pi1r,t1_fe4t295,1578872591.0,Leah tverly should be deleted from YouTube! Like please!!! She said all transmen are lesbians who are afraid to be gay... so I commented saying I’m pansexual and have dated both women and men throughout my transition so her point wasn’t valid. Then she says “well you are biologically female.” Like stfu!!! You make hour long videos about how trans people make you pee on the floor and all this weird shit! Like why do you spend sooooo much time hating on people!
GenderCritical,fcuzeh7,t3_eiqe8s,1577991553.0,Y’all got no lives!! Why don’t you TERFs go find something else to obsess over other than trans individuals! Makes you look like you have no life and must have no friends too :)
GenderCritical,fcuz1kh,t1_fculecn,1577991354.0,Okay Terri the TERF... have a seat 😂
GenderCritical,fcuyw1d,t3_eiydiy,1577991271.0,Trans individuals should be respected regardless of whether you agree with it. How would you feel if someone was being disrespectful towards you?
electronic_cigarette,f9nbz1y,t1_f9nafck,1575481369.0,The whole entire post is about working at a vape shop...
electronic_cigarette,f9l7724,t1_f9l6xso,1575416064.0,I was going to contact the labor department tomorrow. I can’t believe he fired me because I asked just to be paid for 2 days of training. So ridiculous
electronic_cigarette,f9l6z52,t1_f9l6oh2,1575415921.0,I agree lol. Once I deal with the labor department and everything I’m gonna put them on blast. Like they hired me bc I’m like a vaper on instagram making reviews and unboxings and such. Like do you realize you fucked over someone who has a following? I already told at least 10 locals I know who used to go there what happened and to go to the better shop in the town over and they were all like shit I ain’t goin there!!
electronic_cigarette,f9l2lsz,t1_f9l292d,1575413021.0,"Right? Like wtf. It’s clearly not based on my performance since all I really did was clean. And when I was behind the counter for brief moments helping people I was right on it. Getting them their pods salt nice. Whatever. Like I own most of these vapes so i know how to grab the pods quick and then for their salt kids, like I used to shop there so I’ve tried most of them lol. Like fuck outta here he saw me with customers and I did really well but I call him out on it being illegal and he fires me? Apparently he already had hired someone in place of me. Like gtfo you get your vape juices for $5 and sell them for $20 you fucking scam artist"
electronic_cigarette,f9l0hxp,t1_f9kzzha,1575411688.0,Great thanks for the advice I’m going to give them a call tomorrow! They aren’t getting away with this!! Probably why they have only been open 4 or 5 months and have had like 10 different employees 😂
electronic_cigarette,f9kzjfb,t1_f9kz8eq,1575411097.0,Yeah and he fired me today because I told him he had to pay me for the time because it was illegal for him not to pay for training. Wow. Never had a job for only 2 days without even officially starting 😂😂😂 but i threatened legal actions so he is giving me the $75 or w/e for the 6 hours I trained for him. I just kept saying no you have to pay me because it’s illegal to not to. Then I get a text saying oh disregard your schedule immediately your off and best luck to you or some bullshit
electronic_cigarette,f9kopyo,t1_f9knvh5,1575404800.0,The things is I do know my shit. I’ve gotten many devices to test review or do unboxings for. That’s why they hired me because I knew everything already. Then I just asked about Kratom (bc I don’t do that I just vape and smoke bud) and they wouldn’t tell me what to tell the customers and told me just to look it up. I was intended to train but I think the manager was being lazy because he was supposed to clean and had me do instead. Obviously a terrible vape shop that I will not be working at. I know more than the other employees as far as salt nic bc I have almost every device they sell (except for the shitty ones I would never waste money on or even review lol)
legaladvice,f9knk5p,t1_f9kfuz8,1575404126.0,Thank you!
electronic_cigarette,f9kff3v,t1_f9ke8lm,1575399314.0,Thank you!! I’m honestly the only one that works there that actually knows anything and these guys are dealing with the customers while I clean. Like bitch I have every salt nic device in the store except the shitty ones obviously. Like i know my shit and I get products sent to me just to test and review. Like that’s why I was hired but not I’m being treated like a dumb ass! I think they are treating me like this because they know I’m disabled.
electronic_cigarette,f9kdbby,t3_e5l49q,1575398050.0,I’m in New York if that helps! Does anyone know if it’s illegal to make me work like that for free?
electronic_cigarette,f9kcjhj,t1_f9kc8pr,1575397587.0,I asked them about Kratom because they sell it and that’s the one thing I don’t know like anything about. He told me I needed to “just look it up online” and he wouldn’t tell me anything about it!! Like no you are the manager you are supposed to tell me about the products we carry it’s not my job to go home and not get paid to research for them. I think they are just trying to take advantage of me because I’m disabled :/
electronic_cigarette,f9kcb34,t1_f9kc460,1575397447.0,Thanks I’ll check it out!! This is just so weird because I feel like training is going through the store and learning not cleaning up after them. It was a whole shift I’m getting not paid for.
electronic_cigarette,f9kc4mv,t1_f9kbxvy,1575397336.0,Isn’t that illegal? I’m not starting until Thursday and I didn’t get shown anything in the store and just was their janitor for free. And it was the managers job that night but then made me do it instead. And it’s a big store it was probably at least 2 hours of cleaning
bipolar,f8ulziy,t3_e1v0nq,1574834043.0,Update: got offered a job from the vape shop so I might be getting a part time job... first job in like 2 years since I’ve been on disability I’m so scared but also really excited 😬
bipolar,f8ulsz0,t1_f8swvq1,1574833850.0,Ehh I always smoke weed and it’s honestly the only thing that helps me. Because I’m medication resistant so at least I’m calm and won’t start hitting myself

bipolar,f8shoex,t1_f8sefu1,1574780968.0,I love salt bae so I can’t wait to try it!!! But now I have so many juices and I have like 7 pod devices at least but I love my drag nano and my orion dna so I’m not even filling them all the way because I want to try them ALLLLLLL
bipolar,f8shhb6,t1_f8sd1ag,1574780825.0,Oh yeah I’m starting to stock up now lol. That’s my next thing I’m buying. First new vapes and for some reason I need 7 new juices and then got pods. And this wasn’t in one shot... I’ve been in everyday this week. I swear they must think I’m outta my mind 😂
bipolar,f8rwevh,t1_f8rwcan,1574756397.0,Omg they are amazing I’m obsessed and I’m scared I’m going to buy everyone they make but I’m obsessed with vaping lately bc the nicotine cravings are so strong right now and I’ve been so good after quitting. So I spent over $350 in the last week at the same shop hahahaha they must love me I walk I. And they see dollar signs
GrowingMarijuana,f0irzju,t1_f0irfmg,1568646096.0,Great thanks! I’m excited for my first grow! How do I know when to harvest?

Seriously though you are talented as hell and this looks amazing!
bipolar,ert2yjk,t1_erph26s,1561231014.0,Mine suggested I get my med card because it’s the only thing that helps my depression and PTSD. Been 4 years of trying meds and meds and nothing has worked so far. They can control the mania but not the suicidal or depression aspect. Went a year and a half sober and i was worse without smoking.

It’s been 6 months and I’m bipolar 1 rapid cycling with severe PTSD and anxiety. Have at least another month before they will put me on meds. Hopefully I make it that long. Been drinking my face of the last couple days. My therapist had to do a risk assessment on me today bc of how suicidal I am. Of course I know what to say by now so I don’t wind up in the hospital. Cuz fuck that shit"
SuicideWatch,eoy1hdg,t3_btfdd8,1558932040.0,Also trans here. I feel every part of what you said. I literally have been thinking about suicide and fantasizing about dying since I was 12. People fetishize me or think I’m a freak. It’s hard to find people who just see you as you are. Ive been so suicidal lately it’s not even funny. Last attempt had me in a coma for 3 days then 2 months of psych wards n shit :/ I’m just so scared it wont work again and I’ll be stuck living this life
ftm,eoamb7c,t1_eoaesde,1558421674.0,I guess it’s just really hard because I hear it on a regular basis. I live with the asshole. My fiancées father. we rent the basement apartment but when I see him it’s like oh “it” or “the kid.” I mean he’s told me I will never be a man without a penis and he can’t even punch me. Shit makes you feel even worse when it hits at home... literally... and like I do not have much family so it’s hard :/
ftm,eoaeh5y,t1_eoadpdz,1558414715.0,Jeez don’t even get me started with doctors! I’ve had maybe 5 doctors I’ve had to legit just storm out of the office bc they wouldn’t treat me or wouldn’t respect me. Even got escorted out of a hospital by security bc I was shirtless... but like I had top surgery a year ago so I’m not doing anything that a cis guy wouldn’t do.
ftm,eoaecax,t1_eoacxjq,1558414561.0,"I wouldn’t say it’s a mental illness being trans. I suffer from separate mental health issues. Bipolar, severe generalized anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and ADHD. Being trans itself does not make someone suicidal. And everyone gets suicidal.
The suicide rate is so high because the lack of acceptance. People are nasty. I’ve had people say things I would never even repeat again. Definitely not a mental illness, it’s the people who aren’t accepting that cause this high suicide rate. It’s definitely for a reason. Trans individuals aren’t attempting their life for fun... it’s because of uneducated assholes that people just decide they would be better off dead than have to take another day of discrimination. No matter how much you pass, people will always have something to say."
ftm,eoadsri,t1_eoad1g2,1558413979.0,"Yet I’ve been called “it” or “the kid” (I’m 24 and getting married in 4 months...) by my future father in law (god I will never consider him that though) and we have been together since feb 2017. I’ve been on HRT for over a year and a half and have had top. He’s yelled at me for taking of my shirt... has told me I will never be a “real man” because I do not have a penis. Also told me he would never hit me with a closed fist because I’m a “female.”
Like really? I literally am so done. I’ve been that 50% for 3 days I was all hooked up and they didn’t think I was going to make it. Do they really wanna see me try again? Because I sure as hell will make sure I’m successful then. Like seriously treat us with respect or we will all be dead"
