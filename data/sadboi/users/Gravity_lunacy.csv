What’s going to happen after everything kind of settled down? Is JMS going to get back at him? A petty dude with a rich dad is the last thing I want on my ass, ngl."

depression,fbcdf2v,t3_ecj16v,1576721349.0,"Life is truly unfair. My elder brother basically has everything he want ever wanted handed to him. Friends, relationship, family, wealth and fame. 

You would think he must be a person with good qualities. I’ll let you be the judge. 

He cheated on his girlfriends numerous times. Forced one of them to have an abortion. Loves to gamble and had my parents paid for his debts. Faked his performance numbers on his job and got massive bonuses and promotions. Now he is living a high profile life. Everyone thinks he is the perfect role model and inspiration. 

While I am stuck in a dead end job with shitty pay. The world rewards extroverts and condemns introverts like us. It’s really sad that my DNA is written to be a loser, someone to contrast their success."

He is selfish and mean to me all the time. Calling me just to brag about his success and new “toys” he has got. I on the other hand works in a shitty place with shitty pay. My parents think he was only trying to motivate me. I bet if they had a choice, they would probably push me in front of a bus just to save themselves from wasting time talking to me. God, when the fuck are you gonna let me die? Fml"
depression,fbc3hx6,t1_fbamyhy,1576714758.0,Holy shit! You have just narrated the last 30years of my life. It’s kind of creepy to know someone would share the exact same thoughts on this. Then again I guess the odds aren’t small when we have over 7billion people in this world. Fml.
