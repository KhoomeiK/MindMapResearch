schizoaffective,flgr0f2,t1_fleo5d9,1585148604.0,"Yeah I feel this thread is really validating because sometimes I feel like I am faking it and it isnt real enough because I don't ""see"" the things I see. It is still plenty disturbing and scary, and my mind is telling me something is there and I can describe it perfectly as if my eyes did see it. I also keep forgetting that I am medicated so the worst of my symptoms are under control that way. 

Stay well!"

BariatricSurgery,f8tcw2z,t3_e22e91,1574800750.0,I am over a year out and I still struggle with head hunger. It is made harder because my stomach still tolerates all the awful food I ate before. I went down 80lbs and then gained back 10 because of poorly handling an unrelated health condition. Now that things are under control I am going back to having a meal and two shakes a day for about two weeks so I get used to eating better and being mindful about what I eat again. It really put in perspective for me how this surgery is just a tool and not a cure.

I found it to be helpful, but most people in the program couldnt relate to my symptoms, that is to say most people were there for anxiety/depression and didnt have psychotic symptoms. I went for 6 hours a day three days a week, but I could have gone five days... I just had transportation issues. This program was offered through the mental health unit of a hospital, and they arranged for after care. Learning coping skills through group helped a lot, but like someone else said, after a while you have to accept the new normal. It's hard, but hopefully it will get easier for you."

The first is I just feel like there are tons of eyes watching from every direction (and they hate me), and the second type is more involved. I feel like I was kidnapped as a teenager and put in a simulation of some kind, and the kidnappers are watching me to see how I live my life and what choices I make. Idk if the kidnappers are people or aliens. Then I get thinking that key people in my life are plants by my captors to keep me on track and keep my suspicions down. Then I think my medicine is mind control substances. It just kind of spirals out of control from there... I feel silly when the delusion wears off, but I am always at least a little suspicious."
