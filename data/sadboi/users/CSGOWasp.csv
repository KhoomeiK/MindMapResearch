I've been independent for about 5 years and have quite a bit to show for it but I'm cut off from the industry so I have no idea how I stack up. So far being independent is paying out well so I have no reason to switch to the industry yet but I want to make sure I'm eventually prepared to. I'm thinking that when the time comes I may make a very limited scope showcase game since my profitable games are more broad appeal / generic. Good for making money but it doesn't really show off my skill, especially since no one element is well polished since I'm solo."

I only feel for people who I have a personal connection with but to be honest I'm not sure how strong it is. I havent really had anything major happen like a close friend or family death to know how I'd respond.

gamedesign,fqo81gs,t3_gjt3b9,1589509479.0,"From my personal experience / what I'm trying to improve on would probably be putting in the time to really figure out what the community wants out of my games. You end up with a lot of passionate fans who all voice opinions on what they'd like added to the game but to really understand what makes your game work and what areas to strengthen or improve, you need to have conversations with a lot of players and figure out how to ask the right questions.

At least for me this is a big thing right now, it's really shifting my approach. It's so easy to not do this and get caught up in my own vision for what I think the game should be. This is how games lose track of whatever magic they originally had. I honestly don't think most (or at least a sizable chunk) big budget games spend a lot of time doing this kind of thing and it often shows.

Yes there's an overlap in traits between avoidant types and INTJs but I wouldn't assume that most INTJ people are avoidant types. Even though I love my family, I literally start to feel crazy when I have to interact with them. I dread talking to my parents over the phone.

If I recall correctly, the last conversation he had with Skyler was that him admitting that he didn't do it for the money, he did it because he wanted to.
