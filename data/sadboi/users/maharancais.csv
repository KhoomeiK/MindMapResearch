houseplants,fg0uvkr,t1_fg0r0cf,1580415486.0,I pruned the top leaves including the top part of stem. It led to branch out the tree. It’s been a week since I did it. And was surprised to see the new growth appearing so soon.
Monstera,ffel6yf,t3_et1prq,1579852724.0,Soil mix takes longer to generate roots on monstera in my opinion. I usually dip them in water with 3-4 drops of seaweed solution in it. You’d see the roots formation within a week ( I think seaweed speeds up the process ). Let that be in water for 6 weeks when the roots are robust. All my cuttings in soil ( with wax at the bottom ) rotted.

pune,f4jyxq6,t3_dj8cr5,1571629689.0,"     I’m an Alliance française ( Bombay ) student and have lived in France. Yes, the course is expensive and gets more expensive as the levels grow. Initially they had A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2 ( commercial/ business french ). You need to learn at least until B2 level in order to speak French fluently.  

     Alliance française has changed a lot over the years. Back then they had a straight up A1 to C2 courses and now they’ve divided into 2 parts each which makes it even more expensive than before.  Having said so, it’s a fun way of learning french and their technique is brilliant. 

     If you want to avoid paying exhuberent fees at AF Pune, I’d suggest find an online friend who speaks french and learn grammar over YouTube / books. You need someone to speak French to else it’d be difficult to learn ( like any other language ).  There are multiple free sites where you can interact with people of different countries for language exchange ( you learn theirs and you teach them yours ). Or you could find local alternative to alliance francaise. 

     Once you’re through it, you could apply for DELF exams ( for each levels ) at Alliance Francaise Certificate of this test is considered valid all over the world in case you’re planning to go to french speaking countries, mainly like France and Canada got studied or job."
