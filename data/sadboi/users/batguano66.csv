Denver,fkxrwc1,t1_fkxnb82,1584634236.0,"I agree 100%.  They are one place I refuse to work, even though I've been out of work a while and am currently looking.  I contracted for Time-Warner for almost 3 years, from 2015-2018.  During the Charter takeover, things were business as usual for me, and I worked from home almost 100% - that's a whole other story.  But I knew good engineers who were being laid off, only to be replaced by Indian contractors with very little experience.  A lot of those Indian guys were great, but some couldn't even spell Linux.

After that, I picked up a contract gig at Charter as a Linux Admin.  I was tasked to clean up and fix a new server environment they had built.  Within the first week, I saw it was nearly impossible to help them.  They had devops guys who had built the server environment, and due to the aggressive timelines, they broke every security rule to try to get their app stack working.  Gave devs ""sudo all"" access, through group membership - and they didn't even realize what they had done.  Application directories were world-writable.  When I started, they told me they were going into production in a week, so don't break anything.  But I had to fix all the security issues they weren't even aware of.  It was not just a challenge, it was an impossible situation and I didn't want my name on any of it, even as a contractor.  The fulltime employees were the most depressed and exhausted people I've ever seen.  

I could give more examples, but after a month I gave them a 2 week notice and they pretty much shunned me.  My Charter manager wanted me to arrange a meeting with my contracting company just to discuss my departure.  Denial.  As a contractor, I didn't have to do squat other than inform my company that I was leaving.  They just didn't get it."

My last girlfriend I really wanted to spend time with, she was also bipolar.  We started when I was hypomanic, all positive and charismatic, life of the party.  Gradually the depression replaced all that.  When I didn't reach out to her for a week, because I just felt like I was in a hole and I couldn't dig myself out, she just asked if I needed some time.  I said yeah, I guess I do.  She said she needed more than I was giving her.  That was the end of that relationship.  


I understand being with someone in depression is a huge downer.  I'm not sure if she expected me to pursue her after I got over that round of depression.  I didn't.  But I really thought that she would understand, being bipolar herself.  Still feel abandoned after that, though we're still friends on a superficial level.

It wasn't until many years later that I realized I was actually bipolar, so AD meds weren't necessarily the solution.

Yes, it's a medical situation, but it's also a violent situation, and you have no idea what that kid was capable of.  If you call 911, any normal dispatcher would call out police and EMS for a violent situation.  EMS alone won't have the training to restrain and disarm a violent individual.  Police would be involved to restrain the violent kid and ensure he wasn't carrying a weapon, then they would turn him over to EMS for transport to the hospital.  If he was still out of his head, EMS would sedate him and put him in restraints for the ambulance ride.  You did the right thing, don't listen to these people who are living in a fantasy world."

It doesn't work that way, typically. You give the 911 operator the information, and they make the decision who to send according to their SOPs.  In my county, police would automatically be sent to a violent scene along with EMS.  And if you left out the part about the violence, if EMS arrived to find a violent individual, chances are the EMS personnel would call for law enforcement to ensure scene safety.  EMS can handle violent people to some extent, but not until law enforcement has ensured they aren't carrying a weapon.  What EMS might do is give them a shot of something like haldol and use restraints on them in the ambulance.  EMS aren't like the orderlies in a mental hospital you see in the movies."

You don't want to mess with that possibility even if you know the situation.  I was involved with fire/EMS and when people called 911, the county dispatched resources as needed, depending on the nature of the call.  If any violence was involved, they would automatically dispatch law enforcement along with fire/EMS.  If we got there first, we would stay a safe distance away until law enforcement made the scene safe.  Then we would deal with the medical situation.  I'm pretty sure this is typical in the US.  It's kind of a fantasy that you can tell a 911 operator who to send to a call.  You aren't the professional making that decision, the operator is."
AmItheAsshole,fkjovxf,t1_fkjjv0o,1584253327.0,"I was a volunteer firefighter for 8 years in the US.  When someone called 911 in my district, the county dispatchers would take the call and call out resources as needed.  Under no circumstances would they call out EMS services without law enforcement for any potentially violent situation - that goes for suicide threats as well.  We weren't equipped or trained to deal with violent individuals.  And our own SOPs would not allow us to enter a scene until law enforcement ensured it was safe.  I think that's pretty typical in the US.  You can't just pick and choose who you want to show up in a situation like that.  Safety of all personnel AND the subject of the call is paramount.  


Case in point - typical domestic violence situation and a true story.  Woman is drunk, calls 911 and says her husband/BF is fighting with her.  We get paged out, the first firefighter/EMS (we were a combo dept) shows up a safe distance away, takes command and tells everyone to stage at that address.  Police arrives and goes direct to the scene to check it out - it's a crime scene at this point.  They talk to the woman, she says they talked it out, everything is okay, they can ignore the call, the husband/BF has left.  The cops clear the house and tell EMS to go on in and check the woman out.  Same story from her.  She was a little banged up but refused transport to a hospital.  As we're clearing the scene, the last EMS person is leaving the house.  The husband/BF emerges from a crawlspace - he thought everyone was gone and it was safe for him to come out.  The woman who called knew he was in there too.  Thankfully one of the sheriff's deputies had gone down the road to turn around, and we flagged him down.  Goes in, arrests the guy.

whatisthisthing,fkbpms0,t1_fkb8hdg,1584037452.0,"สวัสดีครับ!  Reading and writing Thai is definitely a PITA, but spoken Thai isn't that difficult if you can handle the tones.  Grammar is pretty simple, but I just know a little basic conversation.  Pronunciation of some vowel combinations is also tricky. At least it's an alphabet (abugida actually) and not pictograms like Chinese.   


What makes reading/writing so difficult is the high number of characters (72), multiple characters for the same consonants (for historical/religious/tonal reasons), and the difficulty in determining the tone of each syllable according to complex and archaic rules.  I never tried to learn the tone rules, just memorized the sound of each syllable as I learned it.  They also don't use punctuation and string all the words of a sentence into an unbroken string, though a lot of younger Thais will add spaces between words and including some of the same punctuation we use.  


Look up ""full name of Bangkok"" if you want your mind blown!  If you learn to say that, Thais will definitely be impressed.  Fun fact - the word for the number 5 is pronounced ""ha"", so Thais will write ""55555"" to indicate laughter.  And here is a link with more info if you're interested:

Eventually my partner in crime quit, leaving me back to 100% on call, instead of 50%, which was bad enough.

Or find a way to limit myself to my plans - ie: stick to a 3 day trip and don't bring all the bank cards with me.

I just dread the inevitable depression that comes after, so I have kept it going rather than take extra seroquel and make sure I sleep enough, and calm down with the drinking and unsafe behavior.

Exactly my experience!  The longer I roll with my hypomania, and I can easily go 4-6 months, the more sleep deficit I build up, irritability increases to the point I'm going off at friends for no good reason and losing them, spending money AND drinking like a drunken sailor.  Eventually I crash and burn after doing something so stupid and dangerous that I cannot escape the reality of it, and the depression creeps in over a period of 1-4 weeks or so.  Then major depression until I've processed all the shame and made amends where possible.  


Imagine taking a 3-day trip to the Dominican Republic for the first time, hooking up with a loco Dominican girl half my age, indulging in all kinds of crazy shit, driving her beat-to-shit Honda with the dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree through the barrio at midnight to buy another gram of coca from the gangstas (she was a terrible driver and I adapted to the madness of DR driving really quick).  And this was two days after hooking up with a Dominican-born American woman at the hotel bar, getting blitzed on G&T's and martinis, vaguely recalling some incredible unprotected sex and waking up in her hotel room - and she's a fucking doctor too!  At least she was closer to my age!   
 Hung out with younger girlfriend #2 for 6 days, drinking every night and sleeping maybe a couple hours if that, extending my trip 2 or 3 times, running very low on money and finally making it out of there after 15 days with just enough Pesos in my wallet to get a taxi to the airport and buy a couple beers before my flight.  Of course I only brought enough seroquel for 5 days too.  Yeah, that was a wild one, but it was SO MUCH FUN.  So much fun I had to sell my car for rent money when I got home.  But that wasn't even what made me crash last June.  It got much worse.  9 months of major depression and I'm finally climbing out of it.

I also live in Colorado, and we get a lot of sunshine throughout the year which definitely helps my moods, but I'll sleep right through summer if the timing is right.

It sounds to me like a phase, really.  She might grow out of it in 5-10 years, then you have to explain to everyone why your kid has a Japanese name.  And the kid has to explain it for life.  I'm not saying it's wrong to do, if both of you are on board.  But she really needs to think about what she's doing.  I have an American cousin with a Japanese wife.  They live in the US and their two kids are named American names.  If they lived in Japan, it would make more sense for them to have Japanese names.  Also keep in mind - the Japanese have, um - somewhat of an exclusive culture.  As a non-Japanese, you'll never completely fit in there, even if you speak fluent Japanese and have lived there 10 years.

You can be a white Jewish Cuban who speaks Spanish, or a black Christian Cuban who speaks Spanish.  You could be a green-eyed sandy-haired olive-skinned Moroccan who speaks Arabic, English, French and Spanish.

You could be a very dark Surinamese person with one white parent and one black parent, who speaks Dutch, English and Sranan Tongo.    


Personally, I love to see how people look in different parts of the world, how the features combine in different ways to produce completely unique looking people.  The Caribbean is a great example of this.  I just think all people are beautiful, no matter where they come from and what brought them to this world.  Be proud for who you are!

And you need to be watching upwards when cutting as often as you can.  A spotter might save your life in these situations.

Her van rolled all the way down the hill, maybe 200'.  She was gone by the time we got to her, long gone.  From the lack of blood, it was determined to be a medical incident more than an accident.  But I remember seeing a few drops of blood on the exterior of the van.  She had flopped out of her seat belt.  The EMTs gave her an airway but it wasn't going to happen.  We dragged her onto a backboard and brought her outside through the back door.  Coroner was waiting nearby so we didn't have to haul her up the hill.  I was kinda numb.

Thailand,fitvuo5,t1_fitkt64,1582730495.0,"A couple tricks I've learned:  Get a cold can or bottle of something and hold it to your neck where the carotid artery runs, one on each side.  That cools the blood flowing to your brain and helps quickly.  The wrists are another good cooling point as the arteries run close to the skin - femoral arteries in the upper leg/groin area also respond this way.

Move slower than normal, always walk in shade where possible, duck into shopping malls with good AC to cool down.  Wear light colored clothing as dark clothing absorbs heat.

Peppermint oil is cooling and a drop smeared on your skin will cool it a bit - focus on the same areas I mentioned above for the cold water bottle trick.  You'll smell like peppermint, but it works.  Can even put a drop of peppermint oil in a water bottle and drink it to cool off from the inside.
