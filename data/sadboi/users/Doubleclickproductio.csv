AskReddit,erct043,t3_c191n9,1560721156.0,"This was like two days ago. 

For the past year or so, maybe more, my older sister has been a lot meaner to me. My parents have noticed and have tried to stop her several times. They have talked to her a bunch but after she made another comment to me they finally decided they needed to talk with both of us in the room. After a forced apology, my mom tells me to let the dog out because it was whining. I pretended to leave, but left the door open so I could hear. 

Long story short, my mom admitted to my sister that she had been getting more special treatment that me because of her own issues she had as a younger child (she's 18 now) and that they missed out on a lot of things they could've celebrated about me because they were walking on eggshells with her. She continued by saying I do more chores around the house than my sister, and that now that my sister is making progress with her own issues, she needs to be supporting me with mine now more than ever since my own issues emerged later than her. 

It might not sound like the best thing, but it was actually satisfying to hear some of the things I felt like I would get yelled at for saying (my sister gets more special attention, I do more chores than she does, she doesn't act like she loves me)"
