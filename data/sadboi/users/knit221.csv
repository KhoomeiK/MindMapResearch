Long story, gory details don’t matter here, except that it ended in the former CEO’s wife stalking me for 2 years and later calling me up and dropping the most unhinged tirade. The guy’s whole family was crazy, he was a narcissist, he’d embezzled funds, whole thing was a surreal shitshow. Her parting insults were that *I* was a viper, and that what I’d written (public letters to the editor etc well protected by freedom of speech lol) were “coarse and viperous”. I later decided to take it as a backwards compliment, as vipers ARE beautiful, and varied and interesting, and bonus (against even fucking pit bulls OR hospital executives lol) WILL leave you alone if you leave them alone and show warning signs they’ll attack/to GTFO. An insult to vipers, even, to be compared to pit bulls, useless and hateful hell beasts that they are!"

It’s the cutest, sweetest thing, isn’t it?! They do stay affectionate and adorable in adulthood, in their own ways, not to worry! Most of the fun of chickens for me has been watching them grow up and seeing all their interesting unique personalities develop. I’ve had both snugglers and standoffish birds and plenty of variations between. My runt is now fully grown and happy, doesn’t like being held much anymore and is hard to catch, but occasionally she’ll come up on my lap or if I do have to catch her and carry her she’ll almost instinctively nuzzle into the crook of my arm the way she did as a chick and she will sort of settle and enjoy it for a little bit. I had one who was the bitchy grumpy drama queen as a chick who is now the biggest curious snuggle bug who will come up to the porch and yell until I go out and hold her and give her treats, basically spoil her lol.

The bragging sent me up the wall because not only is it obnoxious and sadistic they have no idea what they’re dealing with and overreacting about roosters doing rooster behaviors! (And as for your comment that aggression helped, I’d say so too, and have any of these people ever stopped and learned about jungle fowl as the precursor to chickens? Territorial, and where some of these rooster behaviors start showing up) Maybe just because I grew up around them and was also around people who generally liked studying/talking about birding and behavior and so on, loved David Attenborough as a kid, had an ornithologist neighbors, parents who kept chickens and generally let us explore. Maybe that made it so I don’t feel like they’re threatening me, just doing their thing, and this current clueless brash trend just GOT me. I don’t know. I know I went over the top yesterday but it’s been good hearing from others who like roosters and are over this attitude. Yay roosters! Earl is a big old sweetheart.

But do want to say the childish smug responses were just as dumb, if not worse. Anyway! Roosters. I’ve seen a lot fakey bravado/mall ninja/playing tough noise and nonsense recently here about roosters. Wanted to clear up why it bugged me but wanted to first clarify this does NOT mean extremism, that there are no aggressive roosters, or militant veganism or who even knows what else. I have a flock of chickens I mostly view as pets and for fun, but am not at all oblivious to what goes on. I’ve helped with slaughtering, I’ve also had to cull violent roosters, it happens. My issue is with a stupid, standoffish attitude I’ve seen in so many settings recently, not just agriculture. Healthcare (it got so bad I left, the psychopathic gomer crap is not only unfunny but doesn’t even help with processing, their proponents just want a space to be rude and bitter), teaching, childcare etc. It’s the idea of compliance above all with deviations being a threat—WITHOUT stopping to figure out what’s causing the behavior and not stopping to realize most behaviors aren’t directed at you/to “get you”. Doesn’t mean be wishy washy, have no boundaries, etc, but know what you’re dealing with. Roosters can be assholes. Because it’s their evolutionary purpose, and in their genetic makeup. Killing one the first time it kicks or flips out is dumb and has no knowledge of how it got there. Separate them, cull the worst, whatever, but the idea that a pea brained bird is DOMINEERING you and PLOTTING to make your life hard is ridiculous and irrational. Roosters will protect their hens. They’ll fight. They’ll have spring fever and screw their brains out. All annoying but *expected behavior for a rooster*. These are animals with their own motivations and ways of operating, watching them will not only help with this but turn the heat down possibly—they aren’t screw-in you over! I"

Learn animal behavior.

Children, animals, patients, etc., are not all “out to get you”, but usually acting according to some format to assert something or get what they need, figure out the patterns and respond (can still set boundaries, not meet impossible needs, etc, I’m mostly taking issue with the loud self satisfied attitude that we can all pinpoint in hated teachers as destructive.... and yet you all want to grow up and repeat it? 🙄) and things are much less of a fight—and you don’t look like some pompous ass talking bigger than you are about mUh rEsPeCt!!1!"

chickens,fowurgp,t1_fow9lmu,1588127586.0,"You can separate them, it’s fine. I have a rooster who’s occasionally a jerk but I’ve figured out their flock dynamics so everyone is divided between two small coops in groups that get along. When he’s going nuts and mounting the girls too much sometimes I’ll leave him in the run while the girls range and then vice versa. Figure out who gets along, give everyone space, it can be done. I advocate kinder treatment and understanding of roosters, they’re really cool birds and have a lot stacked against them (years of overbreeding for fighting, so they’re hopped up and anxious now) , noise, etc., but if you understand what’s going on it’s not a problem and can be managed. And even fun! Ever watched a rooster call his hens over when he finds a treat? Ever had an enormous Easter Egger who’s mostly fluff and is basically a walking painting fall asleep in your lap? (That would be my big guy Earl, a total snuggler) Basically roosters get crap and sometimes deservedly so (sure, I had a violent and psychotic silkie, not fun, life has been easier since he got nabbed by a fox) , but I believe they deserve patience and another look. Plus chicken behavior is fascinating. Watch for a while, it’ll demystify it, and be a bit of relaxing fun to boot."

Check out Vermod! They’re the builders of my house. It’s a small net zero modular house that was built basically from the inside out and then placed on my land (but a “real” house, set on a foundation with a basement). I helped design it, and did a little here and there but it was mostly done by professionals who knew what they were doing haha. Good thing, though, if you do want to build something yourself, there are lots of builders around and good resources like Vermont salvage and various other sort of repurposing yards. I love it, it’s cost very little to maintain, it’s all solar and I bought credits from a solar farm. I had looked at stick building from scratch, but it gets expensive and frustrating fast (to put it mildly!) and this has worked out wonderfully so far. It’s been about 4 years now. It’s not a tiny house, but it is a very small 1 br/1 bath open plan with a large kitchen and living room at one end, bed and bath at the other, I intentionally designed it with lots of windows."

vermont,foifoq8,t1_foic2u0,1587785557.0,"The land in Bridgewater is beautiful, especially up in the hills or along the stream, but it’s a long drive to anything larger or central, in a sort of awkward distance making both Upper Valley/West Leb on one side and Killington/Rutland on the other feel like a haul (but doable, just extra annoying during peak foliage season). I put 20,000 miles on my car living in Bridgewater one year! Now I’m just outside Hartford and my car sits a lot of the time. I originally moved to Bridgewater for cheap rent (because it’s so far out) but was generally unhappy there (personal reasons/things going on/connections I had that unencumbered newcomers would not run into, shouldn’t be a worry), and ended up lucking into a nice piece of land here in Hartford and ways to make building comparable to what I’d paid in rent. I’d say in deciding, figure out what’s most important to you and where you expect you’ll end up spending a lot of time, and choose based on that. Don’t mind driving (or don’t need to go far) and love nature? Bridgewater would probably be fine. Need to be closer, more indifferent to where you land? Maybe look further in. But whatever you do don’t be dumb like me and live right by Route 4–unless you want to hear trucks go by all hours of the day and night! It is the major shipping route across the state. When I say I liked the natural beauty there I usually walked to the river, or drove up to walk on the Gold Coast/back road from Barnard etc. I liked the weaving studio at the mill and of course Ramunto’s pizza is in there too. There’s also a little store in Bridgewater Corners that had good sandwiches and stocked a few local things. The May Day raft floatilla is completely ridiculous in a fun, harmless oh so small town Vermont way, too.

I started a private duty caregiving business and did everything as decently and compassionately as I could but it still didn’t feel like enough. I happened to rediscover my love of dance and art (sort of tangentially through work with a client, and some connections there) and am now applying to a neat little alternative art school of sorts, and I will be studying modern dance. I had done it as a child, used to even say all the time it’s what I wanted to do, but a lifetime of the world yelling at me that art and so forth were “useless” and to repress it, shut up, eat shit, make money, go away and do as you’re told wore on me. I’m revising my application right now, and it just feels right. I’m going to be an art teacher. I may go back and add psychology into the mix, another thing I really wanted to study but was blown off course. I had hoped to be a therapist and to indulge all my favorite research rabbit holes, and there are plenty of ways this could all link up.

But what made it more obvious how cooking can fit into stress relief was growing up with a seriously ill mother and a stressed, overwhelmed father who suddenly had to run everything. He always enjoyed cooking and tended to cook more often than my mom before things fell apart, but when it became a nightly necessity he said how much it helped, something soothing he could control and create something comforting or familiar or satisfying during such a scary chaotic time. We used to get food dropped off as gifts from well meaning friends, but it actually backfired and my parents asked them to stop (“sympathy food” was their snarky code word between themselves). The way they explained it made sense as a coping thing—when everything was taken out of our control cooking could still provide normalcy and comfort. Years later she is doing much better and stayed with me after two major surgeries. The first time some friends put together meal drop offs for us, but it immediately weirded us out in the same way. The next one she completely took over my kitchen and we had one of the closest best weeks together. I helped as I could, which wasn’t much, but certainly appreciated it and enjoyed her company and the chance to see this dynamic in action again. We still send recipes back and forth and talk about what we’re making almost every day.

(He was the shadiest failed businessman grifter type ever lol. I remember he came to our house once and everything he commented on was how he could make money on it. He especially liked the rocks in the river, thought he could sell them as fool’s gold, bonafide idiot.) Being a bunch of dorky 10 year old Waldorf kids we sort of ganged up on her, but of course back then parroting whatever our lefty parents had told us. Fast forward to now and my dad stopped by last week, yelled at me for having a Bernie sign in my yard and insisted the tiny Bernie sticker on my car was the cause of NYC drivers’ idiocy during a trip I made just before quarantine, insisted Biden was good and would “pick good people” and that Bernie’s policies would “wreck the country, but I know you like him.” (He can’t wait to get Medicare, has seen the full evil on display in privatized healthcare in this country through my mom’s long term illness.....butbutbutbut some wonk says Bernie’s crazy!!! 🤦‍♀️) WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!

SandersForPresident,fmni1a1,t1_fmjm46v,1586226524.0,"What a neat connection! Yes we did send a lot of kids to Warren Wilson College, including a majority of my graduating class. Even with the extreme creativity and kindness they showed me for my 4 years there I didn’t feel like I had it together enough to go to college, so went home and tried a bunch of dead end things until I ended up in my own house and building up my eldercare business (while I’m probably going to stop that soon—and the world shutting down kind of ended it early anyway—it’s been one of the more enjoyable and successful things I’ve tried out, I’m just burnt out and seriously considering running off to do art and more creative things again for a few years to get my sanity back). 

I had a horrible time in anything mainstream, period! TMS and Waldorf kept me sane as they could/were useful, but it’s been rough as an adult finding a similar corner in the world that has a bit of that patience and grace as opposed to the incessant fuck you, got mine/hurry mindset. I haven’t heard from any classmates recently, but I’ve really enjoyed mini reunions at various Quaker events. They all seemed to be doing well in their own ways, and we had a lot of musicians come out of there, which I always thought was neat. I played cello and a, just barely getting back into it—I’ve missed it! My first serious crush ended up becoming an investigative reporter, and I found out by accident when he kept being shared around in lefty Twitter circles. He was a bit of a rabble rousing badass but for good in school, too, fun to see how he’s made it work. I still keep in touch with teachers more consistently, probably because they’ve reappeared at various Quaker things more regularly and some still live nearby (I’m in Vermont). I’m actually playing phone tag with one of my favorites right now, seeing if she’ll write me a reference for an art program I really want to do. I’m 27 and still enjoy being in contact with them though it is a bit hit and miss as we’ve all spread out. 

I hated meeting at first, probably because it was required, but grew to love it. Definitely stop by sometime and see how that meeting is. The one I’ve enjoyed going to has been extremely welcoming and kind, they do all sorts of volunteer work and lots of people in the meeting are always doing various other creative projects. They cooked for me after I had a major surgery, and the clerk visited me in the hospital. I hadn’t gone terribly long at that point, either. Since then I’ve helped cook when similar things come up, you’re right the sense of community is very appealing. That’s wonderful you’re in film! I enjoy writing, and have thought about trying little bits or sketches someday. Was the film festival for the Brooklyn Friends School? I never went but have vague memories of posters for it."

I completely disintegrated at age 12, when I went from a lenient environment which I still did very well at, to a public school run by a psychopath who told everyone if they didn’t go to medical school they’d might as well kill themselves now. (He made us analyze every character in every story we read with one rubric only: “Successful vs. Unsuccessful”. He had us put down the artist in an O’Henry story which was an early tip off that I wasn’t welcome and there was trouble ahead—I love “unsuccessful” things such as, duh, ART!) My mom was seriously ill and in and out of the hospital all that year, sometimes coming terrifyingly close to dying. I was terrified of the IV poles and boxes and boxes of drugs in coolers that came home. (I can still hear that fucking machine in nightmares.) 

I loved art and music and lived to play cello. Not medical school material at all! But I fell apart completely and nearly killed myself trying to conform. There were points where I couldn’t hear for all the screaming gibberish in my brain, when I was terrified to speak in case it came out as disgusting and incoherent as it seemed to be in my head. I spent the next 7 years of my life on antipsychotics and desperately trying to find my way back only to blow it again last year when I succumbed to the PREPARE PREPARE PREPARE crap and got tangled in the absolutely appalling and abusive hospital HR system, as I was still beating myself up daily for not going into medicine, feeling like I HAD to because of that asshole’s voice still in the back of my head. 

I’m barely crawling out now, at 27, better medications and a brilliant and kind therapist, and perhaps most important of all: I STOPPED LISTENING TO THIS RIDE OR DIE CRAP. I’m applying to a weird little music and art program. I’m trying to end my remaining medical/caregiving commitments in as graceful a way as possible and head out. I’d rather live on next to nothing but be stable and not wanting to die on the daily, rather than loaded and still completely psychotic. I only wish I’d never gotten caught up by this 15 years ago. This PREPARE PREPARE PREPARE attitude literally kills. Interesting (in a tragic way) that I wasn’t the only one in that class who had a full on psychotic break. There were at least 5 others in my class, one is still struggling and has struggled with suicidal urges/attempts. Some of us have gotten to talk about it and admit how hurtful and crazy it was, and sort of get closure that way, but it hurts my heart to know this is still going on. I honestly wanted to write a bunch of insane threats to that one particularly cruel sociopath spewing crap on the linked thread, it was so noxious, I clicked away because I knew I was that close to losing it. I’m glad there’s more nuance and pushback on that kind of crap in this one. It really is absurd to demand this from 10-11 year olds. It’ll be ok. They WILL catch up. Don’t make them insane."

My house is so new it doesn’t need much maintenance, and I’m lucky to have family nearby who are really good with repairs and help me, and I can do plenty myself too as I love craft and handwork type things, and learning new skills. As for sensory and overload stuff it’s been wonderful, it’s on a dead end road with three other houses and all my neighbors are quiet and introverted so it’s PERFECT. I’ve even had embarrassing meltdowns outside and no bother or threats to call the cops etc. (Not recommending completely falling apart like that if possible lol, just grateful to have tolerant neighbors so I can move on with figuring it out without it escalating.) But close enough to town it’s still practical/accessible. My brother, who has Asperger’s and has been helping/encouraging me as I figure out diagnosis, also has his own house, and it’s been similarly important for him. Well, that, and weed (for both of us).

I find having my own house better than renting for predictability, boundaries, etc. Before I built my house I lived in a sketchy apartment with loud and violent neighbors on both sides, and lots of surprise barging in and rule changes by the landlord. Totally fucked my sense of safety and privacy up, and not being able to predict anything was destabilizing. Now, I don’t have to let anyone invade my space. I can call ahead and set something up, whether that be repairs or visiting or whatever. There aren’t too many obnoxious door to door type things here and all my friends and family know to call ahead.

Actually, right now, one of my big crisis/meltdown/current psychiatric shit going on themes has been trying to find a place that isn’t completely restrictive and humorless so I can actually live my fucking life again without going off all the damn time because one of these goons decided it was a great idea to manhandle and coochy coo and mold and shame and “teach” someone pushing 30, clearly independent and doing well enough thank you very much until they came along. Sigh. Endless rant! 

They seriously make it difficult for everyone. Also, for disability “activism”: none of their stigma bullshit or word policing crap would actually help me or others in similar situations these idiots THINK it helps. What would? Oh, besides a complete culture overhaul and general lowering of stress and rigidity (dream on lol), resources, structural changes, jobs, access, money (oh, not Twitter begging either, I can’t stand the “if you’ve been educated (*gaaaggggg*) ‘tip’ me here” with PayPal links shit, I’m talking about ensuring equal access for more legitimate means of money making, supported employment, better disability benefits, UBI or whatever, not more gig scams and begging). But that requires thought and expenditure and isn’t a sexy PR campaign, so perish the thought! As a Certified Loony, I can say my biggest needs right now are a job that’s better suited to my ability to cope AND have a life, and as it is for many, more money (which one would hope, would come from a decent job once I figure that out). I want to puke when someone says you can’t say crazy or starts in on the “issues” euphemism...so again, not as fun or interesting as useless window dressing to them."
stupidpol,fhikvks,t1_fhhqstf,1581626733.0,"Absolutely. Also, he’s already doing that. His senate office is really good at it. He has a bunch of case managers on staff and you can call and get someone to talk you through it. And Bernie being Bernie we all know he’s simultaneously telling the wonks and ghouls to eat shit, so, in fact he’s doing both. Advocating for those stuck in these systems without for a minute getting lulled into the spin and blither they all put out to try to convince us this is the best we’ll get. I went to a rally against some food stamp shutdown or more draconian means tested bullshit (honestly forget which sleazy move it was that time) and Bernie’s case managers were there handing out cards to all of us worried we were about to get fucked. I think they helped sort out some SSDI tangle for a relative a while ago, too. 

That’s part of Bernie’s cross party appeal (barf to that phrase and usual meaning—of dumbing down real ideas into reactionary wonkish soup) here, though, and it’s not uncommon to see Bernie signs out next to right wing candidates. We all love Bernie for his generally helping nature and refusal to put up with the usual bullshit. I’ve lived my whole life here in Vermont with Bernie just as a given, it’s really not “evil scary” socialism, but simply giving a shit. Give it a try, it doesn’t need to be scary or a dirty word. It’s been fun to “share” Bernie and these ideas with the rest of the country through the election."

I had a frizzle Cochin except she wasn’t a carrier of the gene that makes them frizzle—so she had smooth feathers. But what a love bug, just the sweetest fiercest little broody mama (seemed she was brooding constantly lol!). I miss her. All my bantams got nabbed in a fox attack last summer. Still have the big girls and hope to get bantams again once I’ve redone the coop. Enjoy your chickens!"
