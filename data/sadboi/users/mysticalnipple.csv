I try, when I got diagnosed with my illness I strived to live better but these past few weeks and what my mom has done, it ruined all motivation for me to do anything

I have matured a lot due to all the situations in my life, and because of this I find myself being the blamed one in my family because of it. I have learned to not take shit from people anymore, and how blunt I am sometimes to situations (when appropriate) is something my brothers and other people don’t like. I am not rude, but when I catch people that do things to affect others or me, I call them out. My god-parents blocked me because I asked them why would they tell my dad that they support him in this situation when they are out there partying with my mom and her boyfriend. I was never like this before, to “stand up” or however you call it for others or myself.

And I hope I would be better in the future, but I don’t think I would ever recover. My mother used to be my “best friend” before she cheated and ran away. I think this shadow will always follow me and gloom over me. And with these health issues, I don’t know. It has stopped many opportunities in my life."
KindVoice,fnckxys,t1_fncja9m,1586839416.0,"I have health issues and have been thinking of taking one of my medications. An overdose would cause hypotension and other things so it’s not exactly painful. But, I don’t know if I would do it or not. Probably not. I just don’t want to feel this anymore, I’ve inured it for so long. I’m almost 19 and haven’t even graduated high school yet. I just feel like life now is breathing. 

And no, if anything he is the “gold digger” in this situation. He also has a wife, which my mom knows about. They’re both pieces of absolute shit 

I can’t watch movies, shows, or videos in general anymore that portray families. I get nauseous from it, I don’t know why. But I sometimes feel that I don’t deserve a family or mother because I took them for granted when I was younger. 

I have tried. I have moments where I want to live life but this past month with everything my mom did and me taking all the problems from my “family,” I just have felt the opposite. It is not quarantine related, but everything that my “family” puts me through. 

And trust me, he knows to not mess with me. I have told him I would make him a cripple if he comes near me. Because he has leg problems I was thinking of kicking him in the knee caps (that breaks the legs). And he isn’t really a stepdad, he is anything but that. He’s just her boyfriend and is a piece of shit that ruined my family

And you’re right about that, it definitely is a special type. And my mother was abused as a child and swore to never to do the same to her children, yet, she is doing the same thing. My mom told me she left her bf because she knew that if she left him I’d let her back in, she told me she left him on my birthday and the day after she told me she was back with him. She’s also chased me in her car in the intersection screaming at me and a bunch of other fun stuff like that. Because of her I will need to go to therapy.

I felt the same things too and said it as well. I don’t think you’re a bad person at all. 

And it’s ok to not achieve something you were wanting to do. And it sucks the most when it’s something you were dedicated too. What I can take from this is although you didn’t achieve at it, you can find another thing to achieve in. And I’m sure you’re good at something, we all are. The unfortunate thing is, is that the depression doesn’t let us see it. I’m sure you have things you’re good at, but with the time now you’re mind is probably not allowing you to see it.

She has subtly said that she’s attempted suicide in the past when I last saw her, and then she sent me this. So I worry she may kill herself but being associated with her and talking to her makes me feel the same. I’ll just contact somebody to get a welfare check on her.

But knowing that I have something that will stick with me forever, I know that through it I can learn from it and help others feeling like this and experiencing it too. Those shit situations handed to us may be shitty, but we grow accustomed to it, adapt, and somewhat inure it. 

You’re quite the strong individual, you’ve played life on hard mode, but when you play life on hard mode the rewards you reap are much greater. The thing about it is we have to be patient, it took me many years, and now that I’m better I still have moments where i am depressed. But I have to remember that it is possible to get out of this as I’ve experienced it, I just have to be patient. And I know you can too. This is just a period we’re living in, it’s not forever.

I tried to call my brother who is with her but he told me to stop calling him (he told me that he hates me) and let him do what he wants (not sure what he means). I may contact her best friend (my godmother) but she blocked me after I called her out on supporting my mom with cheating on my dad. I may tell her to handle it as I don’t want anymore stress, and my brothers wouldn’t know what to do in this situation.

And now am getting tested for other illnesses. I don’t blame what I said in the past for what happened to me now, it just is. I found comfort in god personally about it, it reassured me. But please don’t blame yourself, I did that too at the beginning and it made me worse. When found in situations like this we look for a reason for it, and blaming yourself for it even though you couldn’t have done it is not good. I’m very sorry to hear about your mom, but it’s not your fault."
