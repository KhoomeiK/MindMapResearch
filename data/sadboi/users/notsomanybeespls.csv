I went to A&E when I had my biggest meltdown, after calling 111 and the guy advising me to go there since I was having extremely dark, worrying thoughts and was in a terrible place, living alone too. I was in A&E for about 5 hours, just sitting there trying to hold back tears before I was seen to, which I understand because hospitals are busy and overworked and they will likely prioritise physical issues first?? Idk how it works but that's how I imagine it works. But yeah being sat with alone for 5 hours with people with ""real"" or obvious ailments was fairly embarrassing and I questioned why I was there the entire time and felt like I was wasting staff time but I really didn't know what else to do - which, if u have depression & GAD, just furthers the downward spiral. I honestly considered just walking out but I'm glad I didnt because that could've been a turning point for the worst.

It's difficult because seemingly simple things can be really hard for those of us with MH issues to do and the lack of specific and welcoming care can just make us shy away more from treatment. It would be nice to have some sort of designated place for MH emergencies, even if its just so we're in a more appropriate environment with docs dedicated to psych rather than general issues.

I'm in the UK though and it seems our gov only pretends to care about brain issues. Otherwise CBT and other therapies would be more affordable and available in some way. And they wonder why so many self medicate :/"

You're right it shouldn't be a choice between my own happiness and him, but I know how affectionate and loving he used to be, I know theres a honeymoon phase and all, but since I moved in over a year ago, I feel like that has kinda died (he had been asking me to move in about a year into our relationship, I had held off for a while but decided to after another year of seeing how things went). Physical and sexual intimacy is important to me (which I have always been open about & honestly felt a little rejected when he didnt continue with sensual texts and pics, but i just figured he wasnt into that kind of thing) but I cant come to a decision as to whether or not means breaking off something that's otherwise good because of a lack of understanding? As in, I can notice the pattern in the tenseness between us and how long it's been since we shared intimacy and closeness with each other, but when I have pointed it out before he says all I think about is sex and shunned me :/ (which upset me because I've had a grand total of 5 sexual partners, not exactly well experienced lady of the night lol) despite me reassuring him that if his libido had dropped, hes still normal and I'm not suggesting otherwise, just that we need to communicate about it because its important to me??

We have very similar interests and passions and generally match up aside from this stuff that seems to have shown its head in the past year...or maybe it's always been there and I didnt notice idk. I just cant take having breakdowns every month or so because I feel stuck in a loop of feeling frustrated, not feeling heard and eventually blowing up - which is when he agrees to have sex with me and tbh, I cant enjoy it knowing it's only happening to stop me from getting upset. He has assured me it's not my fault before, but that's really hard to keep telling yourself time after time, especially with that inner voice working against you.

Apologies if the info I provide is super messy, my thoughts are also messy and it's hard to organise them into concise paragraphs. I guess I just feel I'm going round in circles right now."
