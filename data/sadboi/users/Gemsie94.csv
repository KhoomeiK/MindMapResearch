She mentally drains me, but my manager does nothing about it. I had a huge mental break down a few months back and my co worker saw my tablets and started saying ""oh my husband is on much stronger ones than that."" Everything you talk to her about she will turn around on herself and make everything about her and how she's got this or had this etc. I wore glasses for a few weeks as I had a problem with my contact lenses, so she came in wearing hers moaning she had a problem. My manager came in with a walking stick because of her knee so she came in the next day with a walking stick. I'm glad I'm on furlough at the moment just for a mental break!
