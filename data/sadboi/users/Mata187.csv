DeadBedrooms,fq8t937,t3_ghh9pt,1589174878.0,"I’m gonna tell you straight from the heart...you’re gonna have to really re-evaluate your relationship with her.  You sound that you’re really want that intimate closeness that comes from sex and you’re not getting it.  The worst part is she’s working you up with emotional foreplay and then leaving you with major blue balls...it kinda feels/sounds like emotional abuse and manipulation.  Especially on the part where you are saying that shes telling you that you are guilt tripping her.  

You’ve actually last longer than almost any guy would, because I know I couldn’t go a month without sex, but a year and a half!!!???  

So I would really sit down with her and figure out where this relationship is going and what you want out of it sexually.  If she is unwilling to compromise or satisfy your needs, then its probably time to move on from here.  At your age, you’re missing out on a lot of sex and no lady should be maliciously withholding sex."

I understand it will be hard to find a moment or two, but you will have to find time to tell them exactly how you feel and the reasons behind not having your brother at the wedding.  You can mention how you only want them there to have their full attention and focus on you since their entire lives have been around your brother.  You can even argue the fact that when you mention the marriage, the first thing that came to their mind was an accessible venue rather than expressing their joy with you.

K-2 was a blast! I excelled in math in 1 and 2.  The teachers I had were the best and they saw my potential.  When standardize testing came out, I was always the top tier in everything.

3rd grade though...worst school year ever.  My school mixed the grades so I had a class that was with not inly some 3rd graders but older 4th graders as well.  And the 4th graders did not like the fact that I was smarter than they were.  Not to mention I was pretty timid as well.  I was pushed around a lot and harassed by boys, and made of by the girls for being “weak”.  My grades dropped and when it came to the standardized test results, I was at the bottom of the tiers.  The teacher...didn’t care.  She was practically out the door and pretty much let us run free when we didn’t have a set lesson plan.  

4th grade was kinda the same, but I changed schools.  The new school didn’t have the corporate funding or sponsorship.  We didn’t even have a computer lab.  The plus side was my class was were only 4th graders.  And the best part was I had a teacher that really saw my potential, esp in writing and math.  When it came time for 5th grade, she made sure that I went to the teacher that best suited me.  

5th grade was alright. The teacher I had was indeed the best teacher for writing and critical thinking (thanks 4th grade teacher). Of course I later found out that she normally had students who basically only been enrolled in only spanish classes (yes there were Spanish only classes).  Of the 28 students in my 5th grade class, only 4 of us went the entire elementary system being taught in English only classes.  At some point, the other 24 students who had spanish classes had to take something of an English assessment test which included a lot of reading, writing and critical thinking. 

After 5th grade I transferred to a private school and stayed in private education until I graduated high school. 

I’ve only seen two classmates my entire time from LAUSD later on in life and both seem to be struggling.  One was a day laborer and the other worked at Jack in the Box."

For me, I live in Los Angeles when I’m on shift for work and in Phoenix where I am off shift.  Both places I live have moderate size kitchens.  Which means, you have more room to store things.  So its more common to cook in and eat out less.

However, if you live in let’s say NYC and you are not super rich, you probably live in a small apartment where space is a premium.

YTA

I get that you say that you have a three year long distance relationship with this guy and were hoping that the emotional relationship will override anything...it is simply not the case.  Some guys can overlook past that, but the vast majority cannot and will not.  They may looks like they are TAs, but in reality, they are not.  

The idea of dating and courtship is to find a future spouse.  And during this time, considering that you are going to be spending the rest of your life with this one person (hopefully), then you and everyone else has the right to be as picky and choosy as you can.  Almost anything can be a deal break...and that’s okay.

You situation reminds me of the three TV/Film scenes you should probably check out: 

1) The Big Short:  the ending scene where Dr. Michael Burry is explaining to his investors that he met his wife on a dating website and he straight up told her he is missing on eye, awkward, and in high debt.  Her response was “you were just what I’ve been looking for”...he goes on to say he was honest.

2) Pay it Forward:  The part where Arlene questions teacher Eugene about his scars and he is open about it.    She ultimately accepts him and his scars after he opens up about it to her.  When they became intimate for the first time, she knew what to expect and didn’t run away screaming.  

3) Lost: John Locke signing up on a walkabout (I think) but was ultimately denied because he was in a wheelchair.  The company denied him because he misrepresented himself when he signed up for the walkabout.  Even though John Locke defended himself and demanded that he be let on the walkabout, the company still refused.

The point I am trying to make is that early on in your relationship (and hopefully any future ones you have), you should have been honest about yourself (to include your physical condition) so that way they can know what to expect fully on you.  Otherwise, you truly are misrepresenting yourself and you should fully expect to be denied a relationship when the awful truth is exposed."
AmItheAsshole,fnan2wm,t1_fnakyes,1586800342.0,"I don’t think he was shallow for his reaction and ultimately for rejecting OP because of her appearance.  You really have to put yourself in the ex’s Point of View.  

He knew this lady for three years.  And yes they formed an emotional relationship.  They wanted to take it one step further and have an intimate relationship.  Rather than expecting the full beauty of two breasts, he is shown one healthy breast and one with scars where the other should’ve been.  This would freak anyone out when not expected.  

This is a trust issue and can lead down a toxic path of mistrust and rethinking the three of their friendship.  Questions will start to form that there is no easy answers: what else is she hiding?  What else is she holding back from me?  And so on..."
