I've kicked the drugs a few times, detoxed and made sure withdrawals is past, but then my mental health just keep on declining and I'm back at it for medical reasons at first.

Then there is a surreal amount of pressure to make up for all the missed marks, you actually have to perform as well on a single night of information gathering and analysis of an entire semester of work.

What is some other effects that accompany the short breath and tightness of chest? Sweating, thoughts racing? If you have healthy lungs and don't smoke a lot with only the tightness and shortness of breath as effects I'd recommend going to a doctor. Try to calm yourself and see if the shortness of breath resides and maybe some effects like racing thoughts subsides.

SuicideWatch,fo6anv1,t1_fo5wjkm,1587552795.0,"Well honestly I can understand then why you feel like that. It seems just about every guy in your life was one big humongous dick. When it comes to forgiveness of family I can at least relate to and well in the end I never forgave my parents for what they did even if they fulfilled some responsible roles at the end. 

Honestly I think you did the right thing cutting communication with the online guy, it can be a good sign of a pretty toxic trait to become pushy to meet irl. 

Believe me, I know exactly how you feel. I have crippling social anxiety accompanied with 'normal' anxiety and the odd panic attack here and there. I have to swallow a few xans just not to freak out going to uni class. 

So my point is, you're not alone in this and I definitely believe you can achieve this without therapy, but like I said I'd start small; small talk with the guy next to you in class or just a quick hi and build up from there. Even if you have to take some anxiety meds beforehand if you do get prescribed any BUT if you don't just know the addicting capabilities of benzo's. Also just notice or focus on some male inspiring characters in say movies or books, maybe that can help you see some good in people.

I'd offer as a pen pal partner, but I'm definitely not a prime example of an inspiring, trustworthy male character I think you need now. I do think however that if you find someone on reddit and just send occasional messages to each other, small talk and how you're doing, everyday life stuff, that even that may help you; it's a small start.

There's such a small amount of people that know or have been through the same as you and just know that you came out strong through all of this, you definitely have some form of life you made for yourself, you have friends etc. My point being again is don't give up and don't undermine your achievements made already."
SuicideWatch,fo54cs5,t3_g5lwwj,1587517233.0,"You have to start somewhere. Maybe try to look up to some male figures that inspires you. What about your dad? Start small. Maybe small talk in class or try to arrange a 'group' hangout with some of your friends where you tell them that the guys' present absolutely have to be trustworthy and that they know them well. Say hi when you walk by with someone making eye contact. Small starts and start building up and gaining confidence. You really have got it rough in the past and I'm sorry for what you had to go through, but you have to realize you can't stereotype people into categories, looking at them all the same. Hell, maybe even try to get a male penpal on reddit, but you would have to look thoroughly through their profile and even that might not be enough to be safe of an unwanted incident. Just try to go out of your comfort zone and start small, casual conversation, small talk etc. would be a huge step."

socialanxiety,fnyu0p7,t3_g4k3oa,1587375623.0,"Yeah, loads. This one time when I was a junior in high school we had this project about sex and this gorgeous girl I really liked was talking with me about our projects and she said I bet you'll really like it with a wink and at the time I had no idea what she meant so I kind of just walked away. 

Fast forward a year or two I was talking to this girl (one of her best friends) and she kind of kept asking who I liked and someone told me earlier that she liked me and I didn't want to hurt her feelings so as the dumbass I am, I told her I liked them both. Things then got really awkward with me and the girl I actually liked - obviously her friend told her and she wasn't in my class anymore so we didn't really have contact with each other anymore so we just exchanged awkward looks when passing by and eventually she found someone else.

Now in uni, there is another girl I finally really like, but now the only way we usually spend time is socializing, like we're usually together in clubs and stuff and the only way to pursue it further is texting her - she did give me her number - but I'm so uncomfortable with this, as I usually only interact under the influence, even only texted her under the influence. It would be just so awkward to suddenly text her like sup and also as I would be so anxious I wouldn't know what to say. I get a lot of 'social anxiety' on texts as well so yeah it's like a great barrier"

researchchemicals,fns92js,t1_fnqjh45,1587216139.0,"Since everyone is accusing benzo's, here is my take on it:

I think this very much differ from person to person due to the function of benzos. Like if someone doesn't really have anxiety I honestly don't see any positive effects for that person to use benzo's except if you enjoy blackouts.

But then for someone who has anxiety, and of course depending on the severity of the anxiety, it's quite easy to abuse since you just take more and more to become less and less anxious (because you want to eliminate the anxiety entirely) till you abuse it to the point of dependence since when you're off it you become just so much more anxious, since after the absence of anxiety the sudden reappearance is so much worse, drastic and the feeling of it come on much stronger, at least temporarily although this time may also vary to quite some extent.

So in my honest opinion I think benzo's can be a great medication for anxiety. Maybe even to be used recreationally, BUT only for the sole purpose of eliminating anxiety, possibly in combination with other drugs for euphoria at social events.

I feel like a lot of people that really don't need to use benzo's use it however like I described and then because of this their anxiety flare up suddenly like I described and because of this sudden increase in usual anxiety and them not being used to it they quickly run back to benzo's which lead to unnecessary addiction, eventual withdrawals and then at the end another horror story of addiction and all its consequences that could have been avoided by some more research, better and longer evaluation of their findings and their decision making concerning the use and extent of use of the drug and the effects they seemingly chase and people should ask why and for what purpose they want to use it since there is like a misconception that benzo's are great recreational drugs which is motivated by the fact that it is glorified in horrible and wrong ways like misportrayal through rappers, media and the stigma around it and how it is viewed in pop culture. This may lead for people to think that it might be giving other effects like enhanced euphoria, a great buzz or even great high where this is not the case at all.

Sorry this shouldn't have been this long, it's just my standpoint towards benzo's. I tried to explain it to great detail since I usually explain shit.

Edit: Also sorry for any possible not so coherent sentences or use of lanuage. English is not my first language."
