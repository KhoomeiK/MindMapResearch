 Schools, here in the US at least, have a lot of free resources available to students. Speak to your school counselor about what is happening. If you are underage, ask what their confidentiality policy is if you are worried about them telling your parents. 

Most school counselors will have experience with this situation as ADHD is under diagnosed and feeling self conscious about it is completely normal.  They should be able to give you some good advice and direction on how to go forward.  Maybe it means regular meetings with them to build coping strategies to help with ADHD.  They can also help by providing learning accommodations, like extended testing time and due dates, or low distraction environments.

Personally I don't like calling it a disability, I see ADHD as apart of me. Its who I am. I'm not lazy or unmotivated, my brain works differently so I have to work harder and in different way to get things done.

ADHD,ezww39u,t1_ezwuh9i,1568226390.0,"I agree. Melatonin could be causing a little bit of morning drowsiness, but this would be negated by the activating effects of Adderall which is why I think it may be an issue as to when the dose is taken, the dosage itself, or depleted nutrients minimizing the effects of the medicine. 

Nearly any amount of a CNS will negate or overcome the possible drowsiness of natural sleep aids like melatonin."

Generally speaking, ADHD brains are more susceptable to addiction than neuro-typical people. Find a therapist that has a focus on addiction and go to support groups. You don't have to force yourself to be vulnerable right away. Make sure that you feel comfortable with the therapist and that they are a good fit for you. When you go to a support group, you can just attend and not participate. Having a sense of community and knowing that there are other people going through the same struggle should help.

I'm sorry you are going through a trying time, just know that you are appreciated and are able to be loved. <3 take your time and I hope  you find the help and guidance you are searching for."

Have patience. Drink more water. Communicate with your doctor."
ADHD,ezwttsb,t1_ezwm6hb,1568224888.0,In some cases yes. But 10-14 hours later is very unlikely especially when taking a stimulant.
ADHD,ezwtbji,t1_ezwrcp0,1568224556.0,"Sorry for formatting, mobile life.

Okay so first make sure you are eating enough healthy food, I have to remind myself to eat sometimes because Adderall does surpress your appetite. 

Drink more water. I have a reusable bottle that I always keep full and with me. (Get one with a straw to make drinking easier) remember to shoot for half your weight in oz. So I weigh about 130 so I should drink about 65 oz a day. This is about 3 bottles for me. It's okay if you don't but just always try.

Vitamins
So in addition to the ones you are taking I also include:
Adult multi vit; everyone should take this tbh
Magnesium citrate; helps with some negative side effects like dry mouth and muscle tension. Also helps with comedown. Evening.
Melatonin; 10-15mg helps if you have minor sleep trouble but it also has great antioxidants which is important because Adderall does cause some neurotoxicity (sounds scarier than it is). Evening.
L-theanine/L-tyrosine; Adderall releases dopamine, these are both dopamine precursors. Your body uses these to make more dopamine. If you don't have any dopamine to release it will feel like it's not working. It will also helps with the comedown, and will give more energy. With meds

Ik it's a lot sorry, but the supplements helped me a lot. The side effects might get worse when you first raise your dose. 10mg is very low so I wouldn't be surprised if this is all because your dose is too low."
ADHD,ezwr96j,t1_ezwm7w5,1568223203.0,Yeah so could be because you are on a low dose. Are you taking any supplements? They are very important to help replenish important things that Adderall depletes. I can give you a short rundown of you want :)
ADHD,ezwl5yf,t3_d2saui,1568219214.0,"NAD: all opinions are my own

Melatonin shouldn't cause any drowsiness in the morning but everyone will react differently. It's not uncommon to feel a greater lack of energy than normal when un-medicated. For me, XR takes about 2 hours to take effect. I set an alarm to take my meds  an hour or two before I actually need to wake up. If I don't my morning routine sucks and so will my first hour of work or school.
You could also see about going to IR. Or get a 5mg IR daily for the morning, but this is unlikely because your current XR dose is rather low.

10mg is a relatively low dose but if it is working then stay at that level. In the end it's up to what you and your Doctor decide is the best.

Also, how long have you been on Adderall?"

I experience similar emotions whenever I make a mistake at work too... I was talking to a coworker and it turned out that it was all in my head. People make mistakes. They might be frustrated in the moment but that does not mean they hate you or think of you as a nuisance. 

All we can do is talk about it apologize, and try to do better next time. The only time you fail is when you stop trying. You can do it, I know you can.

ADHD,ezukg1c,t3_d2do3l,1568154313.0,"Any questions you have should be directed to the care provider in charge of your medication management. Everything below is from my personal experience, research, recommendations that I have received.

Side effects have no bearing on the effectiveness of any drug or medicine. Some people experience little to no appetite loss at all and still see significant improvements and benefits.

If you think there is a chance that you will be taking Adderall for an extended period of time (years) you should try and stay on as low a dose as possible while still gaining the benefits of being medicated. Tolerance builds naturally but most people will not need a dosage increase until they have been on that dose for a couple of years. 

Make sure you are not chasing the rainbow. It's common in the first week or couple months to experience feelings of euphoria or other symptoms of a high in general. Don't expect those side effects to last and chasing that high can be very dangerous as the amount of Adderall you have to take increases very fast and you will never have the same results as the first few times.

If you want to try and keep your tolerance as low as possible for as long as possible here are a few tips I have picked up along the way. Only take it when you need to(at school or work or long studying)  Try to shoot for only 5 days a week, take the weekend off if you can.  
S U P P L E M E N T S
They will help negate side effects and maximize the benefits.

ADHD,ezuihyh,t3_d2egoj,1568152930.0,"Build routines and habits. 

Weekend meal prep is a great option!

 Friday or Saturday night spend some time finding a meal prep recipe that sounds good and save it in your Google keep notes or whatever you use to remember things. 

Then go to the store the next day to get any ingredients you are missing, snacks, and packed lunch supplies (like breb, cheese, deli meat, lettuce, eggs etc)

On Sunday evening follow the recipe to cook your large meal, then portion it out for the week!

When I meal prep I like to use them for dinners and then just bring a light snack for lunch. Maybe half  a sandwich or a salad. 

Pack your lunch the night before if you can, it will save you a lot of time and stress in the morning :)"
