cockatiel,fi7h2mf,t1_fi7bkm1,1582221255.0,"I think it just depends on the dog. My dog is a gentle giant who is very calm with all animals. On the other hand,my nan has a little terrier type dog whos hunting instinct is triggered as soon as she sees a bird. She focuses on it intensely and can't be distracted. She would definitely kill it if given the chance. If your dog is anything like my nans dog I'm not sure that their hunting instinct can be trained out of them. 

 Keeping your other pets in a seperate room when your bird is out would probably be the safest option imo."
cockatiel,fi78att,t1_fhz6vlm,1582216332.0,"Please be careful with the him around the other animals.  It only takes a few seconds for him to be spooked or try to fly and suddenly he's on the ground and totally vulnerable to your other pets.

 My dogs and cats have been around my cockatiel for years and they're quite used to her but even  with their familiarity I would NEVER leave them alone together or not keep a constant eye on them. 

 Just wanted to give you a friendly heads up as you seem new to bird ownership and it's just something to be aware of. Good luck with your new little guy, he's very cute!"

The news report said the two men tried to rob a company on the fifth floor of expensive silks, but died in their attempt. The elevator was found with $500 worth of silk inside, stuck between the 10th and 11th floors.""

I wouldn't have to worry about slaving all my hours away at job I hate to earn not even enough money to cover rent and bills.  - Money could fix that.

I wouldn't have to be constantly worried about becoming homeless and having to give up my animals which are the only things that bring me a slight amount of happiness at the moment. -  Money could fix that.

I wouldn't have to constantly be worried about medical bills that I know I can't afford. -  Money can fix that.


It's not like Id even need hundreds of millions like OP has. Just enough money to live comfortably would more than suffice to make me content as opposed to being suicidally depressed.
