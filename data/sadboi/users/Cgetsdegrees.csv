Learn the law, refer to the drivers manual for a brief recap on what to do at a cross walk, maybe watch a few episodes of spongebob as well. I would argue that drivers need to be extra aware of pedestrians while on the road but that’s just me. Your traffic concerns really don’t make sense when it comes to this setting. You should be more concerned about other drivers on the road interfering with the lanes than pedestrians. Pedestrians really are taking more of a risk.

I still get doubtful and think about suicide but then I remind myself that I will eventually get through it, look back with new insight and be glad I made the choice to keep growing and leaning to love myself. Your therapist probably didn’t went to take care of you anymore for personal reasons or professional reasons. I wouldn’t take it personally. Sometimes people need a break and can’t always be there. Sometimes a therapist can feel overwhelmed by one of their patients who need support, Try to be a bit mindful of their profession. They’re people too and some have families and stuff. You are absolutely right, you are only 16 and you’re being hard on yourself. You’ll probably be ugly now, a lot of girls blossom into beautiful flowers when they get older. All is not lost. Don’t give up on yourself just yet. You’ve got a long life ahead of you. Try to distract yourself. Take a hot bath, go for a walk, talk to someone you trust.

He did end up deciding for himself that the relationship you were in deserved and needed to end. So you need to be like your ex and learn to trust your gut and instinct when it’s telling you what’s best.

You should put your measurements in a calculator and gather some information first and do some specific goal setting before you hit the gym and go bananas. Having a specific targetable goal in mind is really the best way to approach this since your question right now is vague in terms of what you want. Normally speaking, if you have excess body fat it I’ll be difficult to do certain movements. I’ve got a bit of a beer belly so it’s hard right now to do squats or deadlifts because of the shape of my abdomen right now. So if you have that problem I’d say focus on reducing fat. Also since you’re female you should have a mixture of 3 components, diet being the most important, then cardio, and then some weight training. Weightlifting is really what you want to make it so you can increase/decrease the intensity of your workout and journey of you feel like you need to. Hope this helps."

Basically you might enjoy a Sativa since they’re mostly cerebral instead of body high and best used in the morning. Hybrids are for midday and produce a head high and body high. And of THC is too strong for you, find a strain that has some CBD in it like ACDC or harlequin. Hope this helps!"
SwipeHelper,euc6ewk,t1_eubjl2l,1563666337.0,Seems like getting tinder isn’t the best solution. For me I got ON weed just to forget since it treats PTSD. Right now Tinder isn’t in the glory days like it used to. Even the women hate it now. I’d try again once tinder gets their act together.
SwipeHelper,eub0o58,t1_euadfes,1563636873.0,"You don’t need to use any different pictures, if you’re getting less matches go out and take some nice ones and add it. Use it like social media. Flex a little. Look attractive."
SwipeHelper,eua1uj9,t3_cfb0uk,1563597948.0,"Here’s what I learned from trying it myself. Use a new phone and new number and do not restore purchases or use the same Apple ID because tinder is aware of that and has code that will auto detect that it’s you. Make it a completely new and unique account. All new details like email account, basically the new account needs to be completely different from your previous account, of course you can use the same name but try a fake age or something. You can always explain yourself later if the questions ever arise. Best of luck to you bro! 

I do agree that Tinder is the best app. I’ve had moderate success on it in a short time but I abused the system so now I can’t have nice things. If you make a new account just change your pictures and bio around. If you’re active and selective you’ll be more visible within tinder. Happy hunting!"
SwipeHelper,eu9z6i2,t1_eu9u5lj,1563595351.0,"You got banned or shadowbanned. I used to get a moderate amount of matches but I found out they give you a boost if you’re a new account so I got greedy and kept doing it. I have gold now because I forgot to get it off auto renewal. Sucks but I’m not getting that money back. I now have 2 matches with women I actually think are good looking but still. Tinder makes me feel ugly but in reality we just pissed off Tinder. I even emailed them to have them take the ban off, all they did was say reinstall the app and it should work fine. Didn’t really. I’d get off tinder and all dating apps and just give up on women for now and just seek self realization until you no longer need a woman in your life. Once you reach that point in your life you’ll disrespect women in a non-threatening manner and they’ll see that as confidence and will probably fall for you either way if you treat them like human beings that need to earn your love."
SwipeHelper,eu9jxrl,t3_cfb0uk,1563582590.0,"Yep you’re in the same boat as me, probably deleted your account and remade it a few times?"
SwipeHelper,eu6dq1o,t3_cepci8,1563497950.0,"I’m not sure why you’re having trouble, you’re really attractive and your pictures are good and it doesn’t matter what order they’re actually in. But follow the format of having a face shot and body shot a few socials and you’re good to go. Maybe you’re not in a densely populated area? I would get off Tinder if I were you because you don’t need it. You’re handsome and fit and look like a nice guy. So just skip the tinder thing, they’re ruining dating and tinder doesn’t work like it used to."

relationship_advice,etfl3u0,t1_ete5iok,1562772116.0,"Sounds like you love him a lot and think the world of him. But here’s what you should know. No one is perfect and some really good people have some really weird beliefs because of some experience he or she had in life. Find out why he believes that. Ask him questions. Tell him it offends you. Try to talk it through with him. Tell him you’re doubting the relationship with him. He might freak out and realize that his view is enough to get you to have doubts about him. Most men if they love you enough will just get over it. I was in a 5 year relationship and I did everything I could to be with her. Sometimes I did and said things that were a bit off key. I changed and grew. It’s a relationship after all and human beings aren’t perfect creatures. So he thinks women in general shouldn’t be allowed to vote, he’s probably generalizing about a population of women that actually probably should not be voting but he did say you should be allowed to vote, maybe he thinks you’re smarter than the rest and your future children make or female will probably be allowed to vote in his mind. If he treats you like gold you could just talk about it or just be thankful he treats you special compared to all the other random females in his life. Hope that helps?"

TwoXChromosomes,et9v01s,t3_caeoi3,1562605990.0,Condoms are a must when you are just meeting someone and not really able to trust them fully yet. Not sure when trust kicks in for the whole relationship thing. Condoms don’t really make sex feel all that great. I remember when I was a teenager and lost my virginity. Wasn’t all that it was piped out to be even after we stopped using condoms. But if you want to be in a healthy relationship you gotta go through all the steps in order for the woman to feel comfortable. I personally wouldn’t mind using condoms. I had sex without a condom once with someone I barely met and I freaked out and got test and didn’t get anything. But after that I’m never risking it again. Good job avoiding that clusterfuck of a situation!
relationship_advice,esormj3,t3_c8np1n,1562173074.0,He’s struggling financially. He’s 29 and still makes 50% less than you? That’s a red flag. He should be able to make enough to maintain his own lifestyle like you’re able to.
