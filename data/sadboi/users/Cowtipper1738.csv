boston,firx6r7,t1_firnxst,1582672888.0,"‚ÄúCommunism, political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society. Communism is thus a form of socialism‚Äîa higher and more advanced form, according to its advocates.‚Äù- the literal definition from the encyclopedic Britannia. Last I checked Bernie wants a public ownership and communal control of the economy. Also wants to replace certain private properties as well. Is he Josef Stalin or Vladimir Lenin? Of course not. But like everything else in the world things and ideas change evolve. Or have you been too protected in your liberal bubble here in mass to all acknowledge that ?"

Turns out she had cut her vagina fingering herself and was bleeding, her friends took her to the hospital and said it was because I had raped her. My buddies drove me home and defended me the whole time. Most fucked uo part was a year later when I was a day from going to  football preseason camp, she wrote a letter to my house and threatened to have my life ruined.
