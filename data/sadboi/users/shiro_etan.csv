How I cope is debatable since I don't think I'm coping, just in the denial phase but I try my best to not flinch too obviously when people move their hands in certain ways or when I hear loud sounds.

The latter is easier since I can just plug my ear in advance for most situations and others can be easily explained away as other things"

Thank you for responding. It means a lot to me that you listened."
SuicideWatch,eofpck3,t1_eof30oz,1558540213.0,"I just have so much to do, continuously. Before I entered tertiary education, I was already unable to cope with the workflow due to reasons that involve a counsellor. I decided on the this more expensive path instead of the long-time planned road to university as I knew I needed lighter workloads.

Needless to say, I expected more downtime to recuperate. But surprise surprise, nope. I thought it was going to be okay, given that it only had six subjects compared to my previous eight. That and I would do all of them in school to the best of my abilities. I didn't expect all six to dump time-consuming work every single lesson. I'd have barely finished the previous lessons before the next batch swamped in. 

Best of all, currently I have only 2 weeks left in the term and three of the subjects decided it would be prudent to start the last—most important—assignment now. I am at my wits end trying to figure out how to finish and not fail.

Sometimes, I think it would be nice to live in the countryside. A quaint little town that has a moderate season all year round. Maybe write a little, for myself. The only things I need to worry about would be what to eat for each meals. That's it. 

I don't want to think anymore. I'm tired of trying to keep myself afloat in this competitive world. But I still have so much expectations to shoulder. I wish for simpler times but I don't want to be young and helpless again. I'm stuck and tired. I'm not in the condition to be a student. Or do anything for that matter. It's just more times than not, I see myself just letting go."
