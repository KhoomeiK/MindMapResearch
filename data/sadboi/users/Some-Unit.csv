Jean Piaget

Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development had a profound influence on psychology, especially the understanding of children's intellectual growth. His research contributed to the growth of developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, genetic epistemology, and education reform.

Carl Jung

Known as the founder of analytical psychology. He had a deep interest in religion, and its effect on the psyche. Jung also pioneered the idea of dream analysis, and used dreams as part of his clinical therapy approach. He considered himself a natural scientist, and observed the development of people. One of Jung’s most interesting concepts considers the way that people become individuals — and the way that they become “whole” people.

Sigmund Freud

When people think of psychology, many tend to think of Sigmund Freud. His work supported the belief that not all mental illnesses have physiological causes and he also offered evidence that cultural differences have an impact on psychology and behavior. His work and writings contributed to our understanding of personality, clinical psychology, human development, and abnormal psychology.

Burrhus Skinner

B.F. Skinner is known as the founder of modern behaviorism in psychology. His theories are still used extensively today in therapy, including behavior modification and token economies. Skinner is remembered for his concepts of operant conditioning and schedules of reinforcement.

William James

Sometimes identified as the Father of American psychology, James was the very first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States. He is considered one of the founding figures in functional psychology — a counterpoint to structuralism that attributes human behavior to Darwinian impulses of survival and utility. He argued that, for each of us, true beliefs are those which prove useful to the believer. That is, we are driven to perceive truth based on pragmatic impulses, those that best serve our needs, desires, and interests. This framework, along with James’ emphasis on human pragmatism, helped to usher in a new era of empirically-driven psychology in the United States.

John Watson

American psychologist John Broadus Watson is noteworthy for establishing the psychological school of behaviorism, and for bringing scientific rigor to the field through experimental methodological behaviorism. Watson examined the motives behind observable human behavior in areas such as child rearing and susceptibility to advertisement. Watson is perhaps most noted, and notorious, for his highly controversial “Little Albert” experiments.

Ivan Pavlov

Pavlov made his most important contributions in the study of Classical Conditioning. This theory holds that we can be made to have certain unconscious responses to stimuli based on their association to certain rewards. Also sometimes known as Pavolvian conditioning, the concept is best exemplified in Pavlov’s most famous study that used a bell being rung for salivating dogs."""

You don't have to agree that everything is shit. Validate the speaker, not the story. Let them know that you see them, you see how much they're hurting, you see how much pain they're in. So many people just want a witness to their lives more than anything. It makes them feel better knowing that there's someone who really SEES them.

Also, don't let them take that anger out on you. It's not yours to carry. Set boundaries around that."
