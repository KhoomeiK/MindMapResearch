The good outweighs the bad.  I’m sure you have a lot of positive attributes that your girl friend loves about you.  Your relationship might not be meant to last forever but instead of fearing the end try your best to enjoy it now."

I will tell myself things like “no, I have to do this today because I want to do this thing tomorrow and otherwise I can’t” Or I’ll go even a little more extreme and tell myself “if I don’t do this now I’m going to fail.”  Sounds crazy.. but it helps.

AskReddit,fniregg,t3_g1u0ex,1586985033.0,I’ve had so many crazy one time incidents where customers were rude that they all run together.  What is much worse is when you work somewhere and one of the regulars makes you uncomfortable on a regular basis but not to an extreme level that they get banned so your forced to wait on someone that you aren’t comfortable with everyday you go to work.  That’ll make you want to quit.

bipolar,f5h3onf,t1_f5g6hcn,1572200057.0,Thank you for your kind words.  They don’t know what causes this rash.  I got steroid cream and hyrdoxyzine from the doctor that lessen the itch but doesn’t make it go away.  The doctor said it could only last 4 weeks so that’s what I’m praying for.
bipolar,f5h2x8o,t1_f5gi8l3,1572199812.0,I actually had an allergic reaction to lamictal while hospitalized once it was intense but it went away in a day.  I have had a constant itch that jumps from my hands to my legs to my butt to my stomach that isn’t even really that intense of an itch but it constant.  The hydroxyzine and steroid cream lessen it but it never goes away.  The only thing that comes close to relief is distracting myself with physical tasks.  This has been going on for 3 weeks and could last up to 9 I’m so sick of it already I can’t imagine dealing with this for 6 more weeks.  It’s making me depressed.  I just want it to stop.  I feel so disgusting.
bipolar,f3bo871,t1_f3blbrl,1570813853.0,I gained about thirty pounds on it and kept that weight for years.  I’m happy to report that over the last couple years I lost all the weight I gained from it without changing diet or increasing exercise.  I think a big part of that was finding the perfect second medication to pair it with because that’s when I started losing the weight.
bipolar,f3bavou,t3_dgavpe,1570805965.0,"I’ve been taking seroquel consistently for about 8 years.  The first year was extremely rough, zombie-like effects and occasional hallucinations but the benefits of getting a good night sleep outweighed the side effects for me.  In the second year the side-effects lessened and by the third year they were pretty much gone.  I went from sleeping 15 hours a night to a normal 8. Now the only time I experience side effects is if I increase my dose.  A good trick for avoiding that uncomfortable feeling it’s gives you is to take it when your already sleepy, if you can.  Starting seroquel was a huge turning point in my life."

bipolar,f2oq6zx,t1_f2oo6b5,1570331867.0,It’s different.  They actually kinda depicted it pretty well.  The main character is bipolar.  Towards the end it gets kinda hard to watch because it’s too real.  I don’t recommend it to those who feel like their not in a good place.  It ends well but theirs a part where she’s so depressed that she can’t get out of bed to pee till she was physically in pain and i could literally feel her pain.

I’m more worried about birth defects from medication and how pregnancy could affect the stability I’ve worked for for so long.  I’m scared that the medication changes I will have to make to make my body safe to grow a child will cause me to have an episode while pregnant.  I’m scared that I will have an episode years down the road that will have a negative impact on my children.

The you two would witness a third one of you be created and do the same thing and so on and so forth.  Time could go on... creating different realities with different numbers of you or time could just stop and start back at the time you traveled to, your choice.

I lost my job a few weeks ago and the depression followed as it always does after any negative life event that ever happens to me.  Weeks of doing nothing but go between vacationing and staying home in bed.  (Not the best way to handle it but we all grieve in our own ways). In the last few days I’ve managed to sign up for Cobra (I lost my benefits when I got fired), finished doing my taxes (haven’t done taxes in years and finally took a crack at it this year resulting in a lot of complications),  applied for a new job, and.... drum roll please... SIGNED UP TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TEN YEARS.  Tears well in my eyes as I type this because I am so proud of myself for doing these seemingly normal things and I know you guys will understand.

Regardless, the best thing you can do is get ahead of it, see a psychiatrist, go to counseling, take the medication they tell you to, it’s the best thing you can do for yourself."
