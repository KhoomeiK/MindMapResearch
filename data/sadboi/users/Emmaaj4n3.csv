I did get a good tip from a friend, to discuss the problem after say an hour or so as my emotions will have managed to calm down by then and I won't be emotionally driven in what I say. 
Well we only like 30 mins away from each other, but neither of us drive and public transport is a no-no. But I guess we had no other alternative but to get used to it. I think it's made us closer and we appreciate one another more. 

Uhm that was probably 4/5 years ago? I'm aware he is still alive, living the life of a grumpy man. He used to say to my mum that he'd taken paracetamol to overdose etc so it hasn't been the first time, but that was just the cherry on top. But I'm glad I deleted it and just didn't bother to go to his level"

I'm lucky enough that he's training as a therapist so he's really supportive of me and understands why I feel like this. Still tough though! 

We have weekly video dates and stuff to keep it chill and nice for us both though. 
Thank you"

AskReddit,fg0razp,t3_ew5y15,1580413481.0,"So as people know, the UK is known for its underage drinking. SO, it was new years at the age of 14 and it was my first time having more than a glass or wine. 
My grandad and grandma were having a party so all the adults were pretty preoccupied. Cheeky vimto's, and schnapps without mixers were consumed. I was drunk, but it was going to get worse....

Fast forward to 1am, back at my father's house with my step sister (let's call her B) and relatively less drunk. I wanted to drink more and there was vodka in the kitchen cabinet. Now, because my father lives in a bungalow me and B came up with a plan to obtain it without them knowing. 

I was to go to the toilet opposite my room, whilst in there B would get out the window and get into the kitchen through the back (the house is in the middle of nowhere, what are locked doors?) So as I would flush the toilet, she would get the vodka out the cabinet and out the back door again. 

Success! I then proceeded to drink vodka straight and was still drunk at lunchtime and threw my guts up for 16 hours. 


Safe to say I had full on alcohol poisoning, but had the feeling I was Indiana Jones......Not my finest moment in life"

One is driving across a suspension bridge in a small red car with toooo many family members in it. 2 velociraptors would jump up onto it causing it to be too much weight and the bridge would collapse and fall. 

Another is I'd be in a massive supermarket with my mum and stepfather, a T.Rex would somehow be in the building and would search for me when I was hiding, it'd always find me near the washing machines. I've had those dreams for 20+ years"
