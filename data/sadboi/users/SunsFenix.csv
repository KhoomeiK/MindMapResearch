Also the reaction should only apply to attack rolls and ac as I said earlier. That's what I'm suggesting. Additional circumstantial situations should give advantage or disadvantage accordingly and it's really not that hard to move behind cover. Sure in some situations it's going to be impossible to stealth past the first time. Say you're in a hallway or something.

The clone wars and rebels are technically kids shows, although this might be the furthest from a kids show it's gotten consistently."
AskReddit,fp69gx2,t1_fp689x5,1588348469.0,"It's obviously malice and hate in the grandma situation but for me not being shown adequate love was a symptom of ignorance, never knowing how to show love or be there for another person in a meaningful way. There's a lot of ways that people fall apart from lack of communication of feelings, thoughts, wants and needs. Everyone needs love, you have to be willing to give it to be receptive of it, though."
OurPresident,fp16v4w,t1_fp009x6,1588226077.0,"Not the left, idealistic progressives who had a shot to change the status quo but lost it due to various factors. I'd have unsubbed a bit ago, if there wasn't a bit of comedy to it. It sucks overall but I'm optimistic to the other opportunities."

LifeProTips,fo7rq0q,t1_fo634k6,1587583402.0,"I'd prefer to keep my tolerance low, and money in my pocket and an easier buzz. Drinking always felt like a chore to maintain that buzz and drinking more to get the same feeling, feels like a bit too much work."
OurPresident,fo4t9gj,t1_fo4s1nk,1587510768.0,"Kudos to you, personally I'm working still too from home temporarily, but the majority of workplaces are not taking any sort of precautions and what huge corporations are actually doing for their employees is negligent. There's also the lack of healthcare or sick leave among all US citizens right now. Amazon owned by the richest man in the world asking for help in his sweat shops is not the the place I'd want to work."

wholesomememes,fnp3u8c,t3_g30brt,1587138735.0,It's true that they don't care about you when they don't put in any effort and just rely off the past. People who take or do things when it's only convenient for them aren't really worth the investment for friendship.
SandersForPresident,fnkdiva,t1_fnjwwid,1587023051.0,"Shit that's every legal thing. I've lost every legal issue I've dealt with from the lack of legal counsel or because things seem straight forward and I don't want to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars, but still lost."
