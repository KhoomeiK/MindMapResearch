bipolar,fp3ki4u,t1_fp2zjz0,1588280901.0,"I think mood tracking is IMMENSELY helpful for everyone!! It allows you track your progress over time in a way that‚Äôs more reliable than memory! For people without clinical depression/bipolar it can also help spot things that you might need to incorporate into your life like exercise, or identify certain trends and habits that may contribute to lower moods (i.e. you might realize that every time you sleep later than usual your overall well-being dips the next day/few days)."

It‚Äôs relatively easy because it only takes 3 seconds if I want to just enter my overall mood for the day, and not even a minute to enter my mood traits/activities.

The best thing though is that I can go back and add any missing days, although this works best if I do it within a span of a few days because again I won‚Äôt remember and I‚Äôd have to ask family and SO what I was like 3 days ago (I also go through my camera roll for that day to help jog my memory lol)."
