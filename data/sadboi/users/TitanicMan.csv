There's matching by language and continent. Any bilingual players will tell you they do it on purpose specifically to be shitheads to Americans, Canadians, Brits, and Australians.

At this point, they need to be penalized. The amount of matches they pull the ""me no speaky"" card only for them to say ""fuck you"" or ""fuck yo mudda"" when I'm not on the same page as their foreign conversation, is absolute bullshit. Or the only thing they know is ""my friends my friends, don't follow."" Like, they could fucking turn off matching and they know it.

The only reasons people do this is to either be a complete dick and try to ruin people's games because of their flag, OR mooching off randos scores in case they die halfway across the map on their own.

In both scenarios, they need to be fucking dealt with. Either banned from particular servers or banned from matching with languages they obviously don't know, or don't care to engage in. There *really* needs to be a language report button.

What purpose would there be in playing on a server halfway across the planet? None. Worse ping doesn't help them in the slightest.

What purpose would there be in selecting ""match with English"" if they have no intent on speaking it? None. Language barrier is not good for teamwork.

- what's up with the clothing bonuses? Like, why is it that putting on armor *takes away* magic? I could see magical clothing having an advantage which goes away when you take them off, but why does some clothes weaken unrelated stats beyond the stats of being naked? I can't seem to find a good balance that I'm comfortable with.

- magic tips would be appreciated. It used to be my main thing but now I don't know what I'm doing wrong. My magic stat is higher than my attack stats but it only seems to work if I'm wearing magical clothing and almost completely defenseless, in which even another mage will destroy me quite quickly.

- is it just sorta a ""dress for the occasion"" kinda thing? Planning on fighting wizards, get your magic gear on? Planning on a skeleton, put armor on and get a sword? What if there's both?

- I can't remember, is it possible to earn bonds for free? Like, say I bought a single bond. Would the unlocked skills and activities open enough doors I could pay for the next one free? Or is it a mega grind to save up even with the membership?

- if I get a bond then it expires, do I keep the membership items like the rune essence pouches?

Where do you see **pit bulls?** Chained up outside ghetto places, dog fights, hunting, use as a weaponized animal, on the news for tearing out a toddlers jugular

Whether the apple doesn't fall far from the tree or shitty people like shitty dogs, pitbulls always seem to match their owner."
mylittlepony,fq8z8xz,t3_ghg022,1589180096.0,As someone who still hasn't seen past season 5 and Equestria Girls 2...did I just walk my ass right into the biggest spoiler of my life?
CallOfDutyMobile,fq8ypw9,t3_ghe7l7,1589179605.0,"Honestly why not just drop the time limited games modes entirely?

I know BR kinda divides the game, but this is *the* Call of Duty *and* it's free. There's gotta be tons of people to fill every mode.

The console versions have a million modes and it works, and you gotta pay for those ones, and it's divided amongst consoles. I don't get why we can't just do that here."
coolguides,fq8ya1r,t3_gh8zdi,1589179194.0,"I love the small portion of people that call bullshit on ""we believe"" which is fairly accurate

If a company says ""we believe"" there's a strong chance they're blowing shit out their ass"
PUBG,fq7gfyg,t1_fq6nw97,1589146067.0,"It's not good enough for that. I've tested with games I already have. PUBG might run okay, my PC itself is too shit to know for sure. But yeah, I get booted out of almost any game PC or Xbox because of shit connection. Best case scenario a game like GTA says ""everyone disconnected, solo match"" because at least I can play sorta"
conspiracy,fq6eylc,t1_fq68tcw,1589130220.0,"If you think *the* forum of conspiracies on a top 5 worldwide website is legit then you're wrong there bucko.

Ever since the Ellen Pao shit, Tencent, WatchPeopleDie, being able to buy upvotes, social media departments running this site, among other events, there's no fucking way this website isn't compromised and full of distracting propaganda.

If there's anything real here, it's to put a red dot on your mailbox when they come kicking in doors."
backrooms,fq6eerh,t3_ggxysv,1589129916.0,It'd be a really cool mod to have infinite backrooms instead of bedrock. If you go too deep you just fall in.
PUBG,fq6e7c1,t1_fq6d83g,1589129801.0,"hey hey

you are playing PUBG

you *have* internet

I have to play PUBG Mobile because there's literally no internet in the area except one distant Verizon Wireless tower.

PUBG *Mobile* hardly runs sometimes.

I'd do anything to finally play phantom bridge PUBG. I even paid for it, but my internet, PC, and Xbox are traaaaaash."

Bullshit"
