There was a hard-ass full when I was in high school that wanted to beat up everything and everyone. I was cool calm Collective until he wanted some embarrassment me in front of everybody in p.e. Long story short we got into a fistfight in the locker room where I broke his jaw and his ribs.

Yes. I can fight."

We can give them shit and still be friends. We even stuck up for one another. We are 2-10 deep if someone dares screws with us. We are always equal.

The best is a bikini pic. Even twitch! You're paying the woman to be on a screen doing nothing and EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE would you see the reward of them bouncing those jubejubes. You can't touch them, only stare at the smoking hot size 4 waist that you're never going to meet in person. That's what you're paying for.

Hide your suffocation of the sleep deprivation. Hide the lack of unsupportive idiots who think that ""you need to let go of the past"". Hide the fear, the anger, the suffering, and the episodes that can get you sent strait to either the 51/50 or jail.

1: Feel what you feel, and if you can get an explanation out to them then do it.
2: if that doesn't work, play some calming music or any music that's soothing for you.
3: spend time being outside more. I'm always either at the beach or in the forest hiking. I'd hope you would do that too if there is any place to hike or if there's a beach.
4: if THAT fails, blow off some steam and get your frustrations in your anger out in a gym or just go running.
5: if ALL ELSE FAILS, all the advice I'm giving you, go to a therapist. I'm not saying take any drugs but just talk to someone. It really helps when you do.

Life is patience. Even if you don't have any, life will make you be patient."
