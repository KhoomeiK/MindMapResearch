Buena Vista Social Club was specifically formed to encompass traditional, pre-revolution Cuban music; it‚Äôs not stereotyped as traditional ‚Äî it is traditional. As for the other artists I mentioned, Mdou Moctar would more specifically fall under Saharan Rock;  Ali Farka Toure is for all intents and purposes a traditional Malian musician; Amadou and Mariam are also classified as traditional; neither of them would be classified as Afrobeats. So while I agree World Music is a broad genre and doesn‚Äôt accurately categorize much of the music under it, it is a simple umbrella term for music outside of the Western world, which is largely unaware of music outside of its borders or language, and is therefore useful for expanding people‚Äôs music horizons."

AskReddit,fp7plqp,t1_fp7l6jd,1588375190.0,"I have very little knowledge of firearms, so your introduction to them was new information to me. But, if you're out hunting, why do you need a 100 round drum? Or even a 40 round magazine? How many animals are you shooting? When I think of a hunting rifle, I imagine a bolt action rifle; not a semi-automatic chambering one. People have been hunting with bolt action rifles for centuries, why do you need a military grade rifle to kill a deer? 

I don't understand the whole ""ownership"" part of fully automatic or rapid fire weapons (rapid fire including semi-automatic rifles with semi-automatic chambering). If you want to ride a jet ski but don't live near a lake, you probably wouldn't outright buy a jet ski; you should have every right to ride that jet ski, but you'd probably prefer to rent one from a lakeside rental company, no? I see riding a jet ski and firing a fully automatic weapon in the same light; obviously one much more deadly than the other, but both for recreational purposes. 

And you give the impression that obtaining a gun is much more difficult than it is. The ATF estimates there are 2,000 gun shows a year, at which background checks are not required. And where background checks are required, they are (imo) much too relaxed. Many 2nd amendment activists are also advocates for gun control, but the federal regulations as they currently stand are too lenient; even they admit that. 

What I mean by democratic right is a right protected by democratic ideals. I disagree with your statement that it is a ""God Given right,"" partially because I am atheist, and partially because of the 20+ nations in the world that do not protect free speech. I would say free speech (along with freedom of religion, or the press, and of assembly) to be *human* rights, if that's what you mean. But they are *protected* by democratic policy.

I don't know which colleges you are referring to and I don't understand how ""they"" are ""standing on the shoulders of minorities"" to diminish free speech. 

I do not think President Trump is a tyrant. He has little notion of what is morally (or often legally) permissible, but he is not oppressive or violent. Our nation was founded on a system of checks and balances which protects us from tyranny. I do not feel the need to own a gun in that regard.

I appreciate having this discussion with you, because it's a very controversial topic that in today's day and age often turns to yelling and screaming and ad hominum attacks. I, too, respect your beliefs and opinions and hope that none of what I have said has offended you in any way. All the best."
AskReddit,fp7jelr,t1_fp7fxw3,1588371739.0,"I'm not quite sure I follow your comparison of the lack of anticipation regarding portable, plentiful, privately owned weapons of mass destruction (for all intents and purposes, especially when compared with the available weaponry in the 1787) with advocates of stricter gun control writing with ink and quill. If you'd like to expound on that to make the analogy a bit clearer to me I'd appreciate. Don't worry, I'm not taking your response as an attack. 

In response to your final point, I understand how the Second Amend. is meant to protect the First. But, you have to realize we are living in very different times than the Founding Fathers were, both politically and technologically. 

The First Amendment is a democratic right; it is in place to ensure that the citizens of this country can voice their opinions and beliefs without fear of being suppressed by the government. This, in contrast to the strict imperialistic rule of the British, makes sense when establishing a democratic nation. As does providing the means by which to defend that democratic right, along with the means to protect yourself from authoritarian tyranny. We have now been a democratically led nation for 230+ years, and have had 58 (presidential) elections. With democratization, each passing election further solidifies democracy, as the citizens of the nation come to expect it and the politicians who run the country are held to it. You can disagree with me on this, though I'd be pretty surprised if you do, but I feel pretty strongly that the US is not at risk of becoming authoritarian and I think that there are more modern (and peaceful) solutions to ensuring our First Amendment right than guns. 

So I agree the Second Amendment is in place to protect the First, but the First does not need that level of protection at this point in our nation's history, especially when the Second is directly contributing to all too frequent mass shootings and the highest private gun ownership per capita in the world. 

I 100% understand the fun aspect of shooting. I'll admit, I've never shot a gun, but I can only imagine the thrill that comes with it. I see no reason why US citizens shouldn't be able to go to a firing range and choose from a wide assortment of firearms to shoot for fun; I see no reason why you shouldn't be allowed to own a pistol for self defense; I see no reason why there must be 10 million AR-15s and more guns that there are citizens."

This is due to America being founded out of a revolution (against the British). Since then, it‚Äôs become a argument of defending of the constitution as it‚Äôs written and cultural differences.
