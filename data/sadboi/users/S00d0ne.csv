socialanxiety,ewq8k4a,t3_cp5jba,1565659477.0,"WE HATE PRESENTATIONS!!!!!! I know this is bad, but I would stop showing up to class because of a presentation. My grade would drop! No one knew the real reason. It could of easily been solved by asking to do the presentation after class. Also when the teacher randomly picks on people to read or answer. I know this is apart of life and we shouldn‚Äôt block what kids fear lol, but that‚Äôs just what I was scared of... even til this day"

Anxiety,etmtfky,t3_c8gayd,1562968132.0,Congrats! This happens to me all of the time. I always get the job im so fucking proud of you
Rabbits,etlprpw,t1_etkds6c,1562942560.0,You are wonderful!! I will definitely expand his cage! I feel so bad most of the time when he is in his cage and i‚Äôm at work!! I will definitely buy all of that to make him be as happy as possible!
ptsd,etkbxbw,t3_cbr18v,1562894070.0,"Me too omg. I feel crazy like i always feel like i‚Äôm supposed to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and not feel sad or angry and that gives me severe anxiety!!!!! Like whenever i dont feel like i have normal  emotions, i seriously get so distraught!!!!"
Rabbits,etk1w3r,t1_etjy5h9,1562886819.0,"Right now he is in a cage with a plastic bottom. I used to put towels or a fleece blanket & he likes to lay on it, but since he got sick, I took it out. He chews it but doesn‚Äôt eat it because I see the chewed pieces in his cage. I do let him run in my backyard while I watch him. He used to be show bunny or something because he has a tattoo in his ear. 

He is a year and a few months old. I‚Äôm not sure if he has pasturella? & if it breaks out when he is stressed, but there have been no new changes for him to be stressed. My cat has feline herpes and she outbreaks when stressed and gets treated with eyedrops & it eventually clears up. She is very healthy otherwise. So if he has what I think he has, I can deal with it, but the scary part is reading all of the horror stories of bunnies suddenly dying from the disease.. the fact that there are not many rabbit vets near me is concerning. 

I found a place he is scheduled to go to on the 15th on the link you sent me.. most of them I called and the rabbit vets are only at the clinics on certain days or on vacation !! (Lucky me!!!!!) I am trying to figure out what is considers an emergency other than the obvious signs. The discharge is clearing up, but definitely will take him to vet again and keep calling places."
Rabbits,etjxaot,t1_etjvc8u,1562883657.0,I will try the links you sent me and find a doc. I am very worried as I don‚Äôt deal well with sick animals but will try to stay calm. Thank you so much you are wonderful! I will also send a picture of his nose. Right now he is hopping around and popcorning so thats a good sign.
Rabbits,etjx2sa,t1_etjvc8u,1562883509.0,I took a picture of his pee http://i66.tinypic.com/9scncp.jpg
Rabbits,etjuv9n,t1_etjt885,1562882014.0,He jus peed on my cat bed and his urine is milky and cloudy.  Now im freaking out
Rabbits,etjugwu,t3_ca160z,1562881754.0,"He is hopping around as usual. Very active. I am keeping a close eye on him because ive heard bunnies can get very sick and die fast. He does keep grooming his nose and there is the thick white discharge dried up on the right side of his nose and paws. There isn‚Äôt as much discharge as there was before the medication. I‚Äôm hoping I caught it early because as soon as I noticed the white discharge, I took him to the vet."
Rabbits,etju677,t1_etjt885,1562881561.0,I know! I did ask if they had anything sooner and most of them have special rabbit doctors but wont be working until next week. He is eating and moving around fine.  Sometimes I hear the congestion in his nose when he breathes when i pick him up. I‚Äôm going to let him out of the cage to hop around and observe him
Rabbits,etjnz7d,t1_etjlinu,1562877631.0,He has an appointment on the 17th! I have called every place near me & that was the soonest. I hope he can be helped. I really don‚Äôt want him to die!! I will keep you updated!!
Rabbits,etjiz3c,t1_etiphx4,1562874585.0,Okay I am calling a few places! Can he still be hopping around in my room or outside? Or should he stay in his cage?
Rabbits,ethz975,t1_et52xat,1562832304.0,I took him to the emergency vet the day I wrote this. He is on meds and still has runny nose. I am going to take him back I am so scared if he has snuffles!!!!!!!!! He only has discharge coming from his right nostril so not sure if that is common with snuffles?
NarcissisticAbuse,eszheal,t1_eszgaa0,1562362021.0,I know i gave in an listened ugh
NarcissisticAbuse,esz655m,t1_esz5bq8,1562355921.0,I have to do something because I am getting scared now. Just thinking how manic he was speaking to me!! And when i accidentally laughed he said omg that laugh i miss it so much please omg i can orgasm thinking about that. Omg yes thats what i needed to hear i miss you...  i mean he is starting to sound really crazy to me now
NarcissisticAbuse,esz4wsv,t1_esz3iuh,1562355234.0,This is just so ughh. Its really sick.. its like when will this end. I really need to kick this trauma bond and get a restraining order. Bc he will clearly never leave me alone and I need to do everything in my power to think nothing of him also i hope you are feeling better and healing as well
NarcissisticAbuse,esz1cag,t1_esyzyc3,1562353404.0,"Nope! I asked if his new supply was acting up bc he is seriously embarrassing himself by acting this way towards me. He completely disregarded anything about new supply. He said just because I found a victoria secret bag and period pads when I went to pick up more of my stuff at what was our apartment doesnt mean hes seeing anyone ... LMFAOOO WTF does that even make any sense?!... he said its my fault for finding all of that. Thats how I knew he is still full of it and it became comical at that point... i did realize that i was still giving him supply even though I wasn‚Äôt accepting any of the bullcrap he was saying. So i did feel bad breaking no contact by speaking to him...  i mean i even told him wow you are way worse off than I thought.. he said i dont care if im messed up i want you please im sorry... i mean he was acting very crazy and like manic!!! And ive never seen him being that manic before i mean it was really unbelievable. I assume he was drinking before he called me, but he has been blowing up my phone recently at all times of the day so unless he became a serious alcoholic, i dont think hed be drunk the other times.. after i wasnt having it, he let caling back saying he wants to ask me one more thing.. he then again asked about our (now my dog) and when he can see him. He said he misses me and the dog and said hey.. u remember that paper agreement u wrote saying we share custody? And i wanted to cuss him out so bad!! And say u fucking asshole i was diagnosed with ptsd !! I literally almost died not even a month ago and u want me to see u.. let alone have sex!!! Fuck you.. but i didnt. He said i dont wana have to take u to court but i will of i have to. I said your crazy and using my dog as a pawn to pull me back into the cycle of abuse! Leave me alone. 

Things seriously must be going bad in his life because I literally used to tell him exactly
How he was manipulating me and that he is a narc. He knows I know, and I know he knows. For him to keep attempting to pull me back in is bizarre. I feel like hes doing that because he literally cant find anyone who is as good of supply as  me! We have been together on and off, mostly on, since we were 14 and Now im 23 almost 24! I mean literally he had me under his spell for all of these years and I gave and did everything. My mind and reality has been warped from such a young age! Idk how the dating scene is, but I know damn well he will not find anyone or build the ‚Äúbond‚Äù or should I say put the spell on someone so quickly. I‚Äôm thinking he wants them
To be just like me lol and now that other supple isnt doing exactly what he wants bc thats what. I would do, hes having a huge narcissistic fit!!! And crisis"
NarcissisticAbuse,esyh2ib,t1_esyeosv,1562343425.0,Thank you so much for your very kind words! I have been doing very well and in therapy once a week! I am truly healing!! I know how easy it is to get sucked back into this mess & need to take this serious. It is sick and I am so used to it that it really doesn‚Äôt phase me which is scary. Knowing that it really is abusive and scary situation makes me want to keep pushing harder to heal and finally leave him in the past!
