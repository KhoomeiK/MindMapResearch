AusLegal,fr6juj2,t1_fr4pxek,1589927586.0,"You absolutely do need to disclose this information to immigration (when applying for PR - if already on one then no)

When applying for PR you have a medical assessment and it does specifically ask you if you suffer from any mental health condition. 

You then require a medical assessment where the doctors interview you about it.

I have been told they can then access your medical records to see you have engaged in mental/physical health assessment/treatment - not the specific files unless you consent but 100% they can - particularly if it‚Äôs on Medicare they will see the code for MHCP.

If you are found not disclosing it it‚Äôs automatic visa denial for lying on your application.

I‚Äôve sent /u/Valleyofthechads a PM with my personal experience but after saying the above that sounds quite negative (and I know I tried to research it heaps before applying for my visa and was freaking out so don‚Äôt want anyone to read that and do the same) I‚Äôll just repeat the TLDR here.

I disclosed my depression/anxiety and on the form stated ‚ÄúI have depression/anxiety that is well managed by my GP, psychologist and medications. Despite this I function at a high level and have always had employment.‚Äù

Upon interview/visa medical the doctor told me that was the perfect thing to put in there.... asked me a few other questions around my treatments and medications but in the end my visa (189 skilled migrant)  was approved and there was no further information required post medical assessment."
