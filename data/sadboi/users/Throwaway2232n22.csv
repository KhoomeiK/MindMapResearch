The best meal I ever had was when I was high, and spaghetti mixed with ketchup sounded marvelous. Nothing else. Just spaghetti and ketchup.

Took a huuuuuuge mountain of spaghetti and sat in the livingroom at our cupboard which had a door that opened downwards like a tabletop. 

Just sat in silence while eating because it was just so damn delicious and I couldn't get enough of it.

Tried to get that experience again but couldn't. Tis ok, I can still remember what it was like! 

Oh and I've also had times where I was stoned out of my face and my mom came home early. The worst. 

My sister was high once as well when my parents were home, before I knew what weed was. I still remember how she constantly looked on the verge of laughter while talking to my dad, which is what made me wonder what was up with her. Then she let out a silly giggle and said she was going for a nap.

She used to love spending the night with me when my sister and I bought a house together. One of my other nieces used to as well, that sisters daughter, and then a switch flipped and she strictly just loved sleeping with her mom. To the point where one time as a joke, I said, ""and tonight you're sleeping with me!  You're never spending the night with your mummy again!"" And her face just dropped and I had to hug her and assure her and everything, even though I'd said it in a joking voice which she normally picked up on in a millisecond. 

Always thought that was so cute though, that she thought no one would ever possibly joke about her not being able to sleep with mummy, especially since she was almost a teen and still wanted her mom around. Told my sister about it as well, which made her feel even more loved even though she'd known how much her kid enjoyed sharing a bed with her even though she had her own room.

But anyway, my sisters other daughter who loved to sleep with me. She was about 4 at the time. She kept being naughty. And finally I was like, ""Ok bebe, you need to stop."" And then she went quiet and said, ""because then. You won'tt lett me t-to sleept with you anymore rightt?' She used to really pronounce her t's and D's loads, and sometimes where there weren't any. (Wasn't a stutter cuz we watched. Just her little way of talking, which she's since grown out of but it soooo cute üòÇ like.. ""tttttt"" in every sentence)

So then I looked at her and she looked sooo sad and teary eyed, and I was like, ""of course you're allowed to sleep with me! I love it when you sleep with me. And all it is, is right now you need to stop [being naughty]. You aren't always naughty, just right now you aren't a happy camper.""

If we heard the icecream truck, he'd send us running down along the side of his house with one of his friends to get some. The friend would be psyching us up, ""Let's go, let's go, run quick! We're getting ice-cream!!""

She basically went mad over it, I guess she felt responsible but I don't believe she was. He was a drug addict and she stopped saying yes to opening her doors to him. That was the last time she saw him.

She was apparently told to stop asking about him after like a year of persisting. Her own street investigation. 

And then about a week later she supposedly commited suicide. Yet people with nursing history were surprised by the condition of the room where she supposedly hanged. The lack of blood (one witness said he saw her body and expected to see blood in the room because of a cut on her lip and his own experience with hanged bodies later on). And the nail where she supposedly hung herself on, as well as the cord used. They were like, this doesn't sound right.

But the cops treated it as 'oh someone else in this community killed themselves, nothing new.' 

Later on, the daughter was seen dumping a box in the dump, and the older siblings hung out and slept in the room where they had supposedly found their mom hanging and had to cut down.

So it came down to who got custody. Her sister C knew she had papers somewhere that specified C would get her kids if anything happened to her. Those papers couldn't be found. 

My theory 

I think someone killed her because she was getting close enough that she talked about being threatened to stop looking, and that the older kids knew what happened but couldn't say anything. And having their own drug issues, they didn't want to go with their aunt. 

In the end, the aunts husband didn't want to adopt them or their younger siblings anyway and it was all very very very sad. I would have said 'fuck you, these are my babies now and you can go fly a big fuckin kite. Hell, make it an air balloon, bitch.'

But yeah.

 I started slowly. Doing more than I normally did. Some days I'd lapse back into ""well now it's lunch what's the point"" I got homesick and stopped doing a lot of things for about 8 months, so to do some things is a huge deal for me. 
And now I'm setting out my clothes for the next day and planning what I'm going to do and what I'm going to look like and what mindset I'm going to have. All from some little old lady making an impression on her daughter or maybe granddaughter enough that her daughter shared it with the world, and now that little old lady made an impression on me."

I was trying to tell him my brothers were being idiots and it wasn't true but yeah, he didn't listen.

I was in grade 7 at the time and my brothers in grades 8 & 9. I remember them being very hyper pests at that age. Constantly running around the school and neighborhood playing manhunt with their friends while I was new to jr high and very confused about wtf happened to recess. Maybe it's before the next class now? No? Just class all day minus lunch, wtf? You didn't even wean me off recess? Ok maybe it's because it's the first day and tomorrow recess will resume.... Nope. No more recess, big kid."
mentalhealth,fmd2bel,t3_fufp0b,1585957766.0,"Quality over quantity? 

I used to want loads of friends/big social life, and then I got ghosted by someone I really cared about. After that, I stopped caring about telling everyone anything about me in an effort to have a sense of friendship where none actually existed. I didn't care because the person I wanted to talk with was gone. 

And then that feeling turned into- there are acquaintances and there are friends. There's a huge diff between both. Friendship is a special thing and not to be taken lightly. Most people you meet will be acquaintances and that's perfectly ok too. 

I'm much happier now anyway. Much more at peace. I think of myself in a canoe passing other canoers by. Some of us paddle side-by-side, sometimes very short distances, sometimes very far. We're still in our own canoes, and its important to remember that, for our own wellbeing."

I'm taking steps to smarten up- got an app & community, a book, and set up some hobbies/habits to get my head back in a good place. Honestly, I hardly have any hobbies anymore! When I had hobbies, I was literally too busy to drink and I didn't want to.
I'm also including meditation because it's difficult to sit through but has been SO beneficial the few times I've done it. And I think it'll really help with feeling anxious during cravings. Quitting ciggies as well.

I started drinking so often because I had to go to in-law gatherings and we don't click very easily, so being a little oiled up made it easy to chill out and visit with them. And then it just snowballed. Started enjoying it too much too often. 

This is very different from the last time I thought 'oh well actually, I don't have to stop completely- I can have a few here and there.' Because I was thinking of the big party I wanted to have for my 30th birthday. And now I'm like, 'actually for my 30th I will be sober and will do something like invite the girls for a day of crafts or to take a pottery class with me. A nice gentle time with good food.

Sounds like me! I just started drinking during the day and leaving in the evenings if I was too drunk by the time my husband got home. Like last night. Hammered. Came in, tried to pretend I wasn't drunk, and went to sleep after eating. Which spared me a nasty hangover. 

Honestly, the way I budget for my booze. The way I'm sneaking around to drink. How often I drink, with no trigger. I do it because it's fun and I'm wondering if I can even have fun anymore without booze. I don't feel like leaving the house today but I'm going to an AA meeting this afternoon because I'm not happy with how I am. This isn't the person I want my husband to live with either. He deserves so much better and I've put him through a lot and I can never undo it. I feel bad for him."
