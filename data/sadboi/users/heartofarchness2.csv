Drugs,fq8viss,t3_ghajxc,1589176740.0,"cocaine really isn't that big of a deal, dude. you'd be shocked at how many non drug addicts frequently use it. 

I'd say stop worrying but I know as a drug addict myself nothing will make you or family not worry until you see your sister doing well. 

similarly, if she is an addict, almost nothing you can do can make her stop. it's a decision the addict has to come to alone. 

however, kiiiinda just seems like she's blowing off steam. keep an eye on her, let her know you love and support her etc etc. again, she's probably fine. 

you could also try to mention the coke use made you feel uncomfortable."
Drugs,fpsytkb,t3_gfadyb,1588881923.0,"try a 12 step meeting if you're lonely. I'm pretty much a garbage pale for drugs and liquor so I do AA. no shame required to go; most people have done fucked up shit in some way. it's a place people will understand you, deeply."

mentalillness,fnqjb2r,t3_g3ae1w,1587165743.0,"Please don't lie to your doctor's but even more importantly your therapist. It took me a long time to get over the whole ""I don't wanna bum them out"" mentality but yo they went to school for that shit, spent all kinds of money to get into that profession because they want to hear about our problems. And I would wager you are indeed depressed and NOT lazy. You're struggling with just existing, how do you expect to be able to do your class work? 

If you're honest with your doctor AND ESPECIALLY the therapist they can both give you medicine and tools to cope with shit in order to for you to get through your heart ache. Give yourself a chance."
SuicideWatch,fnpmivr,t1_fnplee0,1587148117.0,"The desire not to live is contradictory to billions of years of biological evolution my dude. I'd wager people who want to end their lives without having a terminal illness indeed have some form of mental illness. 

Why don't you want to live anymore? also want to mention i'm mentally ill and also suicidal right now as well just so you know I'm coming from a place of understanding."
SuicideWatch,fnpla81,t1_fnpjzkn,1587147490.0,"Have you ever been seen or treated for mental illness? I highly recommend exhausting all avenues before you end your life. I hate saying ""there's always hope"" but if you've not been diagnosed and tried treatment you could be wasting a good life. many people do recover from mental illness and lead productive and happy lives. you could too."

SuicideWatch,fnphs4u,t3_g35u9u,1587145734.0,Literally the reason I got on this thread. The only thing keeping me from ending everything is how it would effect my mother and my ex boyfriend. Don't get me wrong I love my brothers and I adore their children. It would devestate them. But I just don't think I could do it to my mother. I really only need to purchase this one thing for a nice and peaceful exit but I'm afraid if I do before my mother dies I will just end up using the contraption and leaving her behind. Thanks for posting.
