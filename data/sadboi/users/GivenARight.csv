Right now everything that is getting me quite down is my living situation, among others things. However because of that I know I can change it.

For the past little bit I've been repeating to myself ""time is the only garantee, so continue.""

It's simple, but I know if I keep working as I have been that I know that if I go at it this too shall pass. I just hope not to loose myself anymore than I have.

However on the other hand from the past, I've just used it as examples of what not to do. To try to learn and figure in the best possible way, because no role models in my life, how to treat people the best that I can.

what I'm trying to hold myself to right now, is because I'm such a solitary introvert, I dont talk to anyone about anything. So a bit ago, I heard a phrase by ssomeone that said ""Everyone needs a coach"" I took that as everyone needs someone to help guide you, so I've been working on actually talking to at least one special friend, it's a start.

When I was at my worst, I knew I would never make it to 20 years old. Now that date is less than a week away, things have began to kinda change."
