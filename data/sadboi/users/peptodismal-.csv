You'll be expected to be a team player, that's always expected of baristas but even more now considering the challenges we'll be facing are new territory. I would recommend that if you get overwhelmed by rude people easily this might be a difficult time for this job. You'll be expected how to handle cash, customer service, familiarize yourself with the computer system (easy if you take pictures during training and study them at home). You'll definitely be expected to clean, a lot, like a lot a lot. You'll be learning about our sanitization methods (generally industry standard of you've ever worked in food service), like how long before products are expired. You'll be expected to foster a positive relationship with your coworkers, so if you aren't great at getting along with different kinds of people that would be something to be working at.   
  
As far as what you can expect you'll be doing for awhile is mostly cash register duties or cleaning. Depending on your store, they might want to train you as a barista immediately, but just going off of how my store was pre closing and as it's opening back up, they'll probably want to focus on the former for new partners as not to overwhelm them.  
  
Challenges will be mostly emotional, I'll be honest. Also being very committed to cleaning thoroughly, the expectations might be higher than what you're used to.
  
If you skip memorizing the drink formulas (I can't speak for every store), you'll be memorizing the cycle tasks of cleaning and restocking, which usually is written down somewhere. You'll need to memorize how to brew coffee, prepare cold brew, (if you have it) the nitro system, how to make iced coffee, the expiry dates for products (nobody memorizes all of them unless they've been there years, you can write these down), sanitization methods.

I know a lot of people have been giving him shit for focusing on The Voidz and not utilizing the old Strokes sound anymore, so maybe having that out there first was a way to like, pick away at the expectations.IDK because then it seemed like Bad Decisions was the bone they threw to the Strokes fans who were hoping for another Is This It or ROF track, maybe not though.

TooAfraidToAsk,fpe1fls,t1_fpcac2n,1588538452.0,"I admittedly don't know much about Venezuela, but there was a party in Germany started as a worker's union, this was later infiltrated and taken advantage of by nazis, which then became what we know as the Nazi Party. This is why people will use the argument that the Nazis were left because it says socialist in the name (despite the fact that communists were Nazis first target), similarly to how NK has democratic in its name and China has republic in its name.
  
However it's not like saying that leftist economies can't be authoritarian, and again I honestly don't know enough about Venezuela so it's not my place. However, democrats are not left. They are center right. The social liberal facade fools a lot of people, but Bernie, AOC, others like them are not in favour of dismantling capitalism and they aren't anti imperialism.   
  
I don't disagree with you that power corrupts, and there are certainly people who call themselves left and are way more authoritarian than even right leaning people who are socially regressive. But I just want to make the point that just because a democrat says healthcare should be universal, and college should be affordable, that doesn't make them left per se. Democrats are just as in it for power, control, and money, like any politician, and they aren't really looking to tax themselves, which is why even Bernie who is at best center left, wasn't popular enough with his own party to get the nomination."

So if your goal is to get blackout drunk, responsible drinking would probably mean turning off your phone, informing trusted friends what you're planning on doing, making sure anything that could hurt you is locked away, drinking in a controlled environment.
  
I'd say most people who get blackout drunk *on accident* usually do so under peer pressure and to appear like everyone else, partying and such. Most responsible drinkers don't get accidentally blackout drunk, if that makes sense.   
  
I want to make this point because there are addicts out there who are responsible with their use, just like there are nonaddicts who misuse alcohol and end up hurting people.

But if I've had something to eat and the beer is 5% ABV, I could probably have about 3 drinks.  
  
 If you're drinking for the first time, take it slow to know your limits. Feeling buzzed is like dimming the lights a bit, you can still see but everything isn't as loud and bright as it was. Drink too much, the lights start to go out and then you can't see. Unless you're an alcoholic, you can control how much you're drinking. One light beer is probably not even going to do anything for you tbh, might not even get a buzz depending on the ABV.
