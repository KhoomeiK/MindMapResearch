SuicideWatch,fqgqfhf,t3_gins3m,1589353765.0,"I think the people who feel the same way are the only people who are gonna care enough to listen to you, because they know how it feels meanwhile alot of people just don't get how dark it gets in your head and then normal people label you as a depressed freak or weirdo when in reality if they deal with half the bs you take on a daily basis they'll whine about it. Eh Thats life sorry i don't have some wisdom to bestow upon you it is what it is. Alot of people don't know what your going through and don't understand how it feels and they kick your feelings to the curb, but there some people who care"

SuicideWatch,fqgooui,t3_gip9d3,1589352239.0,"I'm in a similar situation, but in my case i am not allowed or recieve any help when I say I want to go to therapy, my family won't allow me, the only time they think its valid is when you get physically abused or sexually assaulted, i don't know what to tell you, you need to graduate and get to university because its the only way out. Then you can live however you choose to, but with a controlling mom you'll never be your own person if everything you do depends on someone else"
