In my humble opinion, we survivors can experience toxic guilt about nearly everything - I even feel guilty for buying myself a birthday present above $100.  I feel guilty for affording a 2 bedroom apartment for the first time in my life.

Hang in there. I am sure that toxic guilt and PTSD are related, and I need to explore it further in order to try to heal at all as an adult. You‚Äôre not alone in this."

Street food is cheap & the best in the world - one falafel & tapugezer (orange carrot juice) will fill you for longer than you expect!"
