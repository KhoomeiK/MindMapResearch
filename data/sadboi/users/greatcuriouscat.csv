I've been doing what I can to help others because I know what it feels like. I want to be the person I want to help me. But I think others are not appreciating it. They don't get it.

What I do to at least divert myself from thinking too much is that I watch self-help on youtube or listen to posdcast or read articles. Sometimes they help me sometimes don't. It's hard to find self when you lost most of your interests in life. But I do think the best way to do for now is to go to a place where you are alone, be with the nature, and do not think of anything. Just like taking a break from everything. If you can cry while doing it cry. Take time with yourself."

Start getting busy with reading books or watching helpful videos on youtube or listen to podcasts. Make yourself busy by improving yourself and then you'll be surprise that your purpose will come to light. Just do it step by step for now."

Why? Because they will see you as a negative person or toxic one. I'm sorry to say all of these but I've been there. My relatives didn't understand me. My friends kept their distance away from me.

cats,f0qkyyj,t1_f0q7mma,1568861636.0,"Yes. They have been living together for these past years and then this cat1 became like this recently. Cat1 has been spayed when she was just months old but cat2 hasn't, even though she is more than 2 yrs old too and we are planning to spay her too. 

That's is also what I'm thinking. Could it be possible that a cat becomes aggressive when she wants to become the alpha female? I thought there's only alpha male."

sociology,f0oudx5,t3_d3cy0g,1568820466.0,"So relatable. I just found out this subreddit and thank goodness I've found people who I can relate to. I have a degree in Sociology. It has taught me a lot of things in life but at the same time it led me to be this pessimistic and somewhat rebellious too. I often defy what people tell me to do like my parents and friends. I don't agree with what most people I know believe in in our society that's why I tend to be quiet most of the time. It's hard when you want to explain why you don't agree yet you are scared they'll never understand your point.

I often see a lot of things that is hard to explain to others because I am using sociological perspective --- using it takes a lot of consideration and process before I can give the explanation that I want them to hear.

I became a mess. But if still given a chance to take Sociology, I would this choose it."
