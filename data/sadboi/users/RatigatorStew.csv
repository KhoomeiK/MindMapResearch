People can't seem to understand that my appearance and personality are not the same thing, but in all are who I am as a person. They're either focused on one or the other, rarely both. It's difficult for me to accept/understand because I'm not like that. While initially, of course, I take in someone's physical appearance, after talking to them for awhile I form a concept of who they are as a whole and don't focus on specific things like appearance. And yeah, the whole ""You can't be depressed, you're pretty!"" thing is infuriating and makes me feel more isolated as well. Thank you for this. You've echoed a lot of my own frustrations."

But I've posed this question to my best friend several times over the years and he always explains that the person is probably intimidated by me because I'm attractive. Again, I don't see myself that way. I don't look in the mirror and think, ""Wow I'm so pretty"" or think I'm better than anyone else. I genuinely just don't understand these things, because attractiveness to me has never been just about someone's physical appearance. While obviously I am attracted to physically attractive people, I am way more attracted to like minded people with similar interests and personalities that blend well with mine. Appearance is low on the list of important qualities. That's why I don't get how I can get along so well with someone, have so much in common, and really love being around each other and then they are uncomfortable with me on some level just because they perceive me to be more attractive than them. Like, why does that even matter? It's stupid to me."
