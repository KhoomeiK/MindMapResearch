I’ve scanned these forums a lot and some people have been on Abilify 10 mg for years and been fine. One other person has been on 5 mg and has been fine.  It’s worth a try - I have no idea how you’ve been able to bear 15 mg for 2 months.  10 mg was horrible for me.

I’m not a doctor but I do have a scientific background - there’s not too much research done on dose in clinical trials and clinical trials are pretty short - normally 6 weeks.  What your doctor is saying is just not true for everyone.  Different people metabolize (break down) drugs are different rates so 15 mg will be too much for some and too little for others."

Has the second injection worn off yet? The akathisia should go away with time.  Chronic akathisia (like you’ll see in the videos) is rare so I doubt you’ll have it forever.  Do not let them inject you a third time - if you need to be on meds there are other meds that don’t have akathisia as a side effect.  You can find something that works with your body.  You don’t have to live like this.  Akathisia should 100% be a deal breaker when it comes to meds."

Mine was more spread out. It was like a slow “drip drip drip” of coded messages and clues. Intense moments where I couldn’t sleep because I thought someone would come kill me would come sparingly then fade away.  

Our experiences are so similar it’s wild.  I also thought the TV and radio were giving me messages and I spent all my time trying to decipher them. Thankfully I never took any action because I thought I was “undercover” so couldn’t give the enemy any clue that I knew what was going on. I thought that all my therapists and doctors were FBI agents so I figured I was safe.  I did end up in a psych hospital though (thought it was an FBI stronghold so went willingly).  Thought I was undercover there too, until the meds kicked in.

Interesting that you held your normal job during all this.  I also did...I have no idea how I kept it all together enough to not lose my job.

At 5 mg, (barely a therapeutic dose) I feel like myself again and just have some lingering uneasiness that comes and goes. 

I’m on my meds due to multiple psychotic breaks as well, and 5 mg has been okay for about a month.  No problems yet.  Maybe you can negotiate with your providers/the law into dropping your dose so that the side effects are more manageable. 5 mg is risky for me, but it’s worth it...and by risky I mean if I have another psychotic break the delusions might talk me into suicide.  Still worth it."
Akathisia,fmfsxwv,t3_frsjlo,1586034184.0,"30 mg is a really high dose of Abilify...unless you have really really severe schizophrenia I can’t imagine it’s necessary for you to be on such a high dose.

I had akathisia from Abilify and every time I dropped the dose it got a little bit better. I’d taper down a bit slower if I were you. I had to go down to 5 mg to stop the pacing and now I just have a little bit of uneasiness/restlessness that comes and goes. So, it should get better at 15 mg but it might not go away completely 

I take kratom and gabapentin (rotate them) to help the uneasiness.  I have to be on an antipsychotic bc I have mild schizophrenia (it’s either this or have the delusions tell me to kill myself)...so I have to deal with a little bit of it.

Oddly enough, Abilify has been the best one in terms of akathisia for me so far."

AskPsychiatry,fkiwssl,t3_fie1b6,1584230495.0,What dose are you on?
schizophrenia,fkiwkq8,t1_fkidbns,1584230344.0,Okay cool thanks for the reply! Did you have the episodes while you were on the 5 mg? 3-4 episodes is a lot and I feel like my doctor would try and up my dose of that happened to me (I’ve had 3 episodes total but they were really really severe)
schizophrenia,fkhy0op,t1_fkhxko8,1584208102.0,Okay thanks - I drink a lot of coffee and tea but barely any alcohol these days.  No smoking either. Thank you! How long have you been on 5 mg?
schizophrenia,fkhx896,t3_fh0q5m,1584207675.0,"Hey I think it’s your delusions/symptoms that are causing the problem.

It’s probably the increased stress of applying to jobs that’s causing these symptoms. No real person or group is trying to stop you from getting a job."
schizophrenia,fkhwery,t3_fh9uyr,1584207228.0,My delusions definitely had a penance theme from time to time so you’re not alone
schizophrenia,fkhvbm0,t1_fkhid7u,1584206640.0,Is 5 mg of Abilify a strong enough dose to stop your symptoms? That’s what I’m on. Any higher and the side effects are pretty bad so I’m hoping 5 mg is enough.
schizophrenia,fk2qq2q,t3_ffhqvo,1583806969.0,I had to quit law school due to this stuff. No idea how people do it.
schizophrenia,fjo8hzc,t1_fjo30vu,1583522691.0,"Thanks! It’s pretty cool you’re able to manage the illness without antipsychotics. It seems like I have to be in them to be symptom free.  Anyways, thanks for the response."
schizophrenia,fjiisli,t1_fj2faqp,1583368562.0,"Were you on meds? If so, which ones? If you don’t mind me asking"
schizophrenia,fjiieni,t1_fj6kqsj,1583368315.0,"Huh. Those are scientifically classified as hallucinations? Because what you’re describing is like my entire world when I’m in an episode. Lol a 3 legged chair meaning you have 3 years to live.  That’s definitely something my mind would’ve come up with too 

I never knew those were scientifically classified as hallucinations.  Interesting."
schizophrenia,fjhs7s7,t1_fj877u4,1583354093.0,This is why I was prescribed it. It hasn’t really helped but that’s why doctors typically prescribe it.
