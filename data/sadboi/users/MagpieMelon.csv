They’re having a sale at the moment so it might be a bit cheaper, as well as the discount on aluminium greenhouses. I ordered a polycarbonate one from them a couple of weeks ago and it got delivered today. I did a lot of research and decided that the polycarbonate panels would be best for me since they’re hard to break, uv stable and block out harmful rays so they won’t discolour and I won’t get harmed if I’m in the greenhouse a lot. They also sell any accessories that you might want too.

I already spend a lot of time in my garden, so I wanted something I could also spend time in in the winter."

Well they touched my leg, like jabbed their hand into it hard enough to hurt and I turned around to tell them off  only to see that I was alone. There was no one else in the aisle, but I was certain there had been someone there. I put it down to me being tired or something and carried on with my day. Later on I was getting ready for bed and I happened to glance at my leg in the mirror. I had a massive bruise in the exact place that it had happened, and I hadn’t bumped into anything or hurt myself at all recently.

Fibromyalgia,fqlixik,t3_gjfdgw,1589459304.0,"When I was 13 I started having a lot of problems with tiredness and school work. I would struggle to concentrate, and began to misunderstand stuff (fog). My parents told me I was fine and that there was nothing wrong, but obviously it carried on. I developed anxiety and they finally took me to the doctors, for them to also tell me there was nothing wrong. I’d been going to the doctors throughout childhood for pain in my legs, poor balance amongst other things but was told I was fine, and my parents told me there was nothing wrong and to get on with it.

So I turned to energy drinks to get me through the day, without telling them since they’d get angry with me. And then when they didn’t work, I started skipping school. I was extremely bright, but I just about got through my exams and I know I could have done so much better if I had had energy to do anything. At 16 I again went to the doctors, told I was fine. So I carried on just getting through each day. I worked with my mum because I couldn’t really do anything else.

At 20 I got promoted to the job I really wanted at work, I was very good at it and it didn’t stress me at all. But I ended up having to take time off because I was ill again. I couldn’t understand it since I was eating super healthy (as per the uk government guidelines) and should have been able to work. But I couldn’t, so I went back to the doctors and trusted that they could help. Well this time they told me I was depressed and anxious, even though I had no reason to be. So I listened and went to counselling, and my counsellor actually thought I was much older than I was due to my ability to reason and talk things through which usually doesn’t develop until later on. So he basically told me I wasn’t depressed, and then I can across an article about celiac disease.

Turns out I have celiac disease, which was causing most of my problems. But it didn’t end when I figured it out. A year after that I was made redundant, and then I haven’t been able to work a full time job since (24 now). My friends mum encouraged me to get tested for fibromyalgia, since my parents still told me to just get on with my life and didn’t believe or support me, and so eventually I’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. 

It was a battle, which my parents didn’t help me with. And I never would have done it without my friends mums help. At the meeting with the rheumatologist where I would find out if I had it or not, my mum was supposed to take me. But she didn’t feel well so she said she couldn’t. So I had to get a taxi, whilst she watched tv. My dad refuses to acknowledge it, despite me talking to him and printing out the leaflet which the doctor gave me, which he then lost before he read it. My mum always says that she needs to understand it more, but then makes no effort to, and says I’m hard work."

If someone had been available to spend 20 minutes with one of our children then I would have been very happy with that, as it would mean that I could have given more time to the other children in that moment. As it was, I managed to be able to give all of my key children the time they needed, so that things ran smoothly.

Now they’ll still make me feel ignored and like they don’t care sometimes, but they make the effort not to do it too and it helps a lot. 

You’re not wrong in feeling ignored and excluded, their behaviour is making you feel like that and it’s not something you can easily change. You might not be able to change it at all, depending on your parents. But depression and anxiety can definitely cloud your judgment as well, and stop you from rationalising things. I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way, it’s one of the worst feelings in the world and it feels like it will never go away. I wish I could tell you it will, but in reality it will likely go away for a bit and keep coming back. For me it comes back less and less, but I know that it probably won’t ever go away completely. Fortunately those times become less and less, and better times become more frequent, at least if you can figure out what’s causing your depression and anxiety and work on it."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fokdhpo,t3_g7tggm,1587840040.0,"Unfortunately I’m finding this with my family at the moment. My mum said to me earlier that I have a warped sense of who she is and how she thinks, and I said to her it’s just the facial expressions and little comments that she does sometimes which make me feel that way. She then told me that she’s quirky and I shouldn’t judge her the same as everyone else and completely invalidated me. 

This is probably why I’ve been such a pickmeisha in the past."

Celiac,foa2i8z,t1_fo7xlhm,1587638054.0,"You seem like you know what you’re doing! I think the diet has probably helped you in the short term, but you do need some fruits/vegetables for those other nutrients and variety. 

Just try and add things in slowly, and go for low oxalate foods to begin with. Good luck with it all!"
Celiac,fo6h76m,t3_g604ls,1587558698.0,"I would add vegetables/fruits etc. Into your diet. A carnivore diet might be helpful for some diseases for a short time, but long term you’re going to find you become deficient in things. Especially having celiac where our digestion is already worse than the general population. 

Obviously don’t jump into it, just add things slowly and beat in mind that your body probably won’t like fruits and vegetables at first since it’s been such a long time since you’ve eaten them. I’ve tried a lot of diets (keto included) and your body does adapt to what you eat. Obviously if you have an actual allergy/disease then it won’t, but don’t give up if you feel awful after eating some fruit."

Fibromyalgia,fo240f8,t3_g56cxz,1587449034.0,"I have celiac disease which has caused so many problems to me. I strongly suspect it’s caused my fibromyalgia, as the symptoms lessen when I don’t have gluten and make sure I get good nutrition. Unfortunately I ended up having a little bit of gluten in one of my weekly meals each week for two years and never realised until about 3 weeks ago. My fibromyalgia has been it’s worst in those last two years and has eased a bit in the last couple of weeks. There’s definitely a connection there for me."

But now that I’m properly gluten free again, the world is a lot brighter! I have energy, I’m not anxious, and I have no mood swings! I’m so glad you’re experiencing this too, it’s the best part of being gluten free!"

DepressionRecovery,fnva1vo,t3_g3q63p,1587285545.0,"This happens to me every time I eat gluten. Before I found out I had celiac disease, my life was like what you’ve described. I’d still live my life, I’d feel happy enough and never thought anything was wrong. And then out of the blue I’d get these sudden mood drops that would be unrelated to anything I was going through. I actually thought I had bipolar or some kind of mood disorder, but didn’t have enough of the symptoms for one. 

Now it only happens if I’ve had gluten, but all the old feelings come back. I start feeling suicidal if I’ve had enough gluten too. I get really bad anxiety and start crying for no reason also, it really feels like the entire world is ending. It’s awful, but at least I only have to worry about it occasionally now instead of all the time."

Celiac,fnmlepb,t1_fnm12sk,1587073546.0,"See, I’ve done this before. I was actually getting glutened weekly for 2 years and would often bring up how much pain I was in and that my symptoms matched having gluten. I was dismissed each and every time and told I couldn’t have possibly had it since they were so careful with cross contamination. I was seriously considering cooking all of my own food, but it means I have to feed them too or they get annoyed with washing up or the fact that we don’t have meals together. I think there’s probably deeper issues with my mum because unless it’s convenient for her, she dismisses any problems I have.

I normally do hover, unless she’s drinking or in a bad mood. And she drinks quite a lot so I haven’t been helping as much. I do cook a lot too, but I find that I have to buy everything for it and I just can’t afford it all the time. I pay for the family cats food and vet stuff, not to mention rent and anything that I actually want. I think this just highlights issues in this family."
