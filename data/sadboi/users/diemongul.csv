AmItheAsshole,fn5iwbb,t3_fzepe8,1586666080.0,"I disowned my family or got disowned either way it was the best thing to happen to my life.

My brother was the only one they cared I also worked all the way through high school and financed everything myself cause they won't care about me like clothes, activities, competition etc etc.

But I never cared about financial support my parents were giving to my brother. The thing I snapped and moved out was they were limiting the chance I would have academically. Making me babysit my brother's kid while I had university and part-time work.

Also after I quit my job they didn't give me money just free labor and it was really affecting my grades and I couldn't go to summer study session abroad I have been planning for months after my GPA dropped from 3.8 to 3 I knew I should move out and never speak with them. Now with my girlfriend, I am really happy and free.

So I suggest if they are hindering who you can be in the future by limiting your chance disown them.

depression,eqig7lt,t3_bycijd,1560086361.0,"This is my story it might be too long but I just want to share my secret I have never told anyone.  When I first joined first grade the teachers considered me a genius in math and other subject but mainly math. I participated in a lots of district and state competitions and got first place (from 1st - 9nt grade). Even the state considered me their math prodigy and gave me a lots of benefits. About that time I was diagnosed with a brain cancer which sucked so bad that I couldn't go to school  for 1,5 years. Eventually the miracle happened and I was so happy and felt so good to be alive and wanted to go to school and join my classmates. Well the teachers and my relatives told my parents that I should join my old classmates even though I knew that I was not on par with the level of that years students. At first it was great I was catching up on my studies hung out with my friends but the state competition began. Everyone the judges, politicians, state education ministers they all  greeted me so kindly and rooted for me even the previous competitions gold medalist (I didn't participate due to cancer) said well dude I think this time I will be getting the second place but deep down I knew that I wont get a medal. I was so scared of people being disappointed in me that I couldn't even write my name.withouth shivering. So the first phase ended till this day I never even bothered to check the names of kinds that passed this phase in the past I would even say ""the kids who couldn't even pass this are trash"". But you know what I waited couple of 6 hours to see if I passed. It was hellish I can't even describe it with words. Seconds felt like minutes, minutes felt like hours I was scared, scared of what would people think of me if I don't even pass this, how would those ministers and teachers would treat me. Almost passing out due to nervousness and throwing up couple of times I didn't pass. My parents said it was okay but I knew deep down that they were disappointed in me but more importantly the teachers and kinds started making fun of me I skipped so much that I was expelled out of the elite school that state enrolled me. After that competition I never tried to learn math again I was too frustrated too tired too embarrassed. In my new public school kids kept making fun of me eventually that turned into bullying. Bullying mad me hate school if I had the chance I would skip it sometimes I wouldn't go to school for months. Because of my old medals and reputations the new teachers never failed me or scolded me. Playing computer games become my only meaning in life or the thing I enjoy, I wasn't friends with my classmates (every boy except one of my class bullied  me). My parents tried couple of times to encourage me to study but I lied and flown my way through 3 years of highschool. I went to university yeah but it was not the one I was dreaming. Now I have few friends and my social life got better by a little but I am not the same one I used to be. I just convince myself you can't learn this or you are less than everyone. All of these bullying disappointment and expectations just ruined me now I doesn't even want to live anymore. Sorry for the grammar mistakes"
