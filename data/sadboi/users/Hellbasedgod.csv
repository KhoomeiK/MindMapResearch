AteTheOnion,fr4ggrk,t3_gmgfe5,1589887461.0,But really what's up with the step sis and step bro stuff? Why has it become to popular?
BoomerTears,fr3bdsz,t1_fr0q2jp,1589853782.0,Right? I'm graduating in debt and hoarding food is the last thing on my mind. I've been shopping normally ever since shit hit the fan because I don't eat a lot to begin with. I live in Texas in a small county and I've mostly seen middle class grown adults shopping like crazy and buying meat and toilet paper out the ass.
churchoffutaba,fr2xq9q,t3_gm8uei,1589845930.0,The crossover I didn't need but now I want.
OutOfTheLoop,fr2xd1o,t1_fr2rkd1,1589845731.0,"Eh, I personally like it where it stands. It'd feel really awkward to have a platform full of shit posters and weebs  shared with business. Slack already exists."
gamedev,fr2ohcg,t3_gm3x61,1589840912.0,"Pong was my first game back when I first learned programming, with Java in community college. Keep it atan, wish I started as early as you!"
PERSoNA,fr21576,t1_fr1q1dh,1589829365.0,"I was surprised by the difference between vanilla PS2 and emulator, sure the character models still look silly but it's nice to see them upscaled rather than a jagged mess."
egg_irl,fr20nb0,t3_glzo2z,1589829128.0,Pokemon really do know how to design the cutest fake characters.

TikTokCringe,fqqjq66,t1_fqqck95,1589566723.0,"It's mostly teenagers who want to be ""different"". Grown adults either like it or don't really care for TikTok."
PERSoNA,fqpzn8o,t1_fqphf16,1589556861.0,That would be interesting. If I recall correctly Persona 5 was supposed to take place around the world.
Botchedsurgeries,fqpza3n,t1_fqpp2aj,1589556676.0,He looks like a PS1 character model.
facepalm,fqon34y,t1_fqokyz8,1589519237.0,Look at what happened when the Tiger King documentary came out. We're hopeless.
Cringetopia,fqoltqz,t1_fqo8yk8,1589518313.0,I've seen this same exactly format like 5 different times referencing different characters.
facepalm,fqkv4ds,t1_fqj3f1m,1589437170.0,Yeah. It's just a shit fest overall. This virus honestly has me hating our species more and more by the day. Stay safe out there man.
facepalm,fqj1moe,t1_fqiizr9,1589403815.0,It's funny how a lot of Redditors criticize boomers for letting the media tell them how to think yet they let memes tell them how to think.
facepalm,fqj15nw,t1_fqi8ky6,1589403631.0,"Do you have a kink for being state shamed or something? Take it easy, don't let others represent you. With that sort of thinking we'll never see any slight progressive change in Texas."
facepalm,fqj0zi4,t1_fqi3o9c,1589403565.0,Maybe they're trying to kill all of us by making the Conservatives to spread it to everyone.
facepalm,fqj0ns4,t1_fqivtdm,1589403443.0,Tell that to the idiots upvoting.

facepalm,fqj062y,t1_fqieh82,1589403251.0,Wtf are people in your county doing? Mine is about half that size and we've had a total case of 30 or so and there are plenty of idiots here.
Persona5,fqacul2,t1_fqaccl5,1589216895.0,Yeah I was hoping for the same too... I've only stuck around for the cool fanarts and cosplay. For actually discussing the games I prefer places like r/Megaten or r/Persona. Especially even more so now that I've played some of the previous Persona games and Megaten.
Persona5,fqa9lcz,t1_fqa8r10,1589215251.0,"Yusuke was definitely one of my favorites too, Akechi also especially after playing Royal"
Persona5,fqa7kzs,t1_fqa2gb4,1589214229.0,r/Persona and r/Megaten are the only places I prefer now.
Persona5,fqa7hrw,t1_fqa5ylu,1589214184.0,"People could say the same for P5 also, I was hesitant at first because of the fanbase."
Persona5,fqa7dqz,t3_ghgudi,1589214127.0,I am the JoJo fan. Honestly didn't really like any of the girls too much except for Yoshizawa.
learnprogramming,fq56ixe,t1_fq3ktml,1589094126.0,This pretty much most jobs. Most companies are not creating anything fun and that's reality.
Megaten,fq3tqn7,t1_fq37q66,1589070159.0,FES is my preference but I can't deny how many things Portable does better.
gatekeeping,fpsgka8,t1_fpqltvq,1588873107.0,Kinda like how people do with Ron Swanson.
PS4,fps1und,t1_fpria88,1588866066.0,It really depends on the game. Persona games for example I never regret all the time I put into those because... It's actually fun and interesting. It isn't some open world game with X amount of copy paste quests.
PS4,fps1qdo,t1_fprdhy2,1588866010.0,Yes. I'm tiring of these so called open world games with large but empty environments and copy paste quests.
PERSoNA,fpqebgr,t3_gerl9a,1588820871.0,Because it's Atlus. I'm convinced most of their decisions are random.
Coronavirus,fpmndbp,t1_fplf247,1588736949.0,I other words things as usual.
pcmasterrace,fpmmmkh,t1_fplx48a,1588736460.0,I think only long-time users use it. A lot of the zoomers don't even know about old.reddit.
PrequelMemes,fpm3mes,t1_fpm2nu2,1588724878.0,That's EA's customer base for ya.
Megaten,fpkzwmn,t1_fpka5j3,1588703926.0,Couldn't have said it better myself. In 4 and 5 I didn't really feel like a leader as I did in 3.
Megaten,fpjp8cn,t1_fpj408v,1588676759.0,"That's an interesting point. I never did mind the AI or lack of direct commands in this game. Personally I felt the same as you. I don't hate the actual gameplay of P3, I just don't really like how long and repetitive Tartarus is."
Megaten,fpitgxw,t1_fpii5qv,1588648339.0,P3 is my favorite but even I can admit the gameplay can be real ass sometimes. By that I mean Tartarus. It's such a slog.
JustUnsubbed,fphzfc3,t1_fphj8jg,1588630678.0,Have you browsed that place?
ProJared2,fpdr1t4,t1_fpdg818,1588532502.0,JRPGs will always have lots of flaws. The thing is that im a good JRPG they don't outweigh the good. I have a a lot bones to pick with P5R but I still enjoyed it. It's pretty natural in a game you'll spend tons of hours on.
JustBootThings,fpb8tl3,t1_fpat677,1588464572.0,I meant decrease in general.
JustBootThings,fpa9vh2,t1_fp9rzoq,1588443761.0,Athletes aren't average people. They e been training for years. Also for most people T-Levels are gonna be stopping by mid-20s and onwards.

AskReddit,fp0vblz,t1_fp0sqsw,1588217741.0,Just my two cents... I've seen more Gen X and older protest against this virus more than anybody else. The younger ones are all for flattening the curve and don't mind keeping distance for a while. But the older ones seem to be unable to sit still.
AskReddit,fp0v491,t1_fp0r77x,1588217608.0,Well they probably use them more in class cause they're bored.
PhonesAreBad,fp0twl8,t1_fp0hmgu,1588216823.0,Hard agree.
PERSoNA,fp0e6uh,t1_fp0dvs5,1588207543.0,"I agree. I think a perfect Persona game in my eyes would be the gameplay of 5, story like 3, and characters like 4."
PERSoNA,fp0dcjq,t1_foyo7zd,1588207084.0,"I played P5 before 3 and 4 and you're so right about the retreading of 4 into 5s story, made me like the game a lot less. Although I thought the new semester was a nice touch, it felt more in line with the overall theme of the game and made the ending much more conconclusive. But that's just my opinion."
Megaten,fp0c7bj,t1_foxw9f1,1588206465.0,Lately all is see is P5 stuff.
wholesomeanimemes,fp0agim,t1_fozk2jq,1588205518.0,While that's true I feel like that works better for video games because of the layer of interactivity.
PhonesAreBad,fozwri1,t3_gafjiv,1588198243.0,Jokes on them I don't like social interaction
ProgrammerHumor,fosr5kh,t1_for3x3p,1588036339.0,Because of how verbose enterprise software is. Especially Java.
woooosh,fopj8ty,t1_fooe5sd,1587962939.0,I think PewDiePie probably cringes at the sub too tbh.
Megaten,folntgm,t3_g8413c,1587866326.0,Devil Summoner is the only one worth much. All the others are readily available on eBay for $20 new. Devil Summoner is around $60 used.
notliketheothergirls,folnitb,t3_g7zn4l,1587866132.0,These masks are every where in South Texas.
PERSoNA,foky1pf,t1_fojyexw,1587851121.0,I hated him so much but also laughed my ass off every time he talked.

RapMoreLikeCrap,foe623q,t1_foe401t,1587696753.0,"Honestly as a rock/metal fan, 80s rock was generic as shit."
RapMoreLikeCrap,foe5so2,t1_focsxhe,1587696605.0,I don't know about deep and philosophical but it's pretty obvious there's a huge racial bias with r/dankmemes Redditors and black rappers.

PERSoNA,fo7bco6,t1_fo76ft7,1587575440.0,"I love P5, but the Makoto fans are extremely vocal and annoying."

Persona5,fo78uel,t3_g5xt1v,1587574230.0,I liked him so much better after playing Royal. They really built up that rivalry bit in the social links so much better than in Vanilla.
starterpacks,fo6sb9b,t1_fo6msao,1587565775.0,"Same. I actually never really saw him as edgy even back in the commentary days though, I mean he didn't make fun of disabled people like leafy."
starterpacks,fo6s530,t1_fo6knl3,1587565676.0,"Because he actually grew up, that's why. And even then he was very self-aware when he did make the content he did."
Persona5,fo6gge5,t1_fo6evx8,1587558111.0,Nothing wrong with waifu culture but people here sound thirsty while doing it lol
Persona5,fo6eogv,t1_fo67w7r,1587556617.0,Right? I mean even as a mid 20s male this sort of thing hits home hard.
Persona5,fo6ejct,t1_fo693f1,1587556492.0,Same. Ever since I actually played the other Persona games I've liked browsing r/Persona better.
Persona5,fo6egjk,t1_fo668ei,1587556425.0,Because most P5 fans are teenagers from what I've seen... This sub is ok sometimes but every once in a while it feels like r/teenagers.
insaneparents,fo6e8sn,t1_fo5obbb,1587556236.0,Yeah. Rarely any parks are unique.
wholesomeyuri,fo6e2kz,t1_fo6cyou,1587556083.0,Right? I freaking love her man.
worldnews,fo6di3v,t1_fo68ro2,1587555572.0,"I've noticed a rise from it in nursing in particular. I see it all the time and I wonder where the hell did they get their license from? The school my girlfriend goes to would tear people like that a new one, and it's one of the most rigorous nursing programs in the state."
Cringetopia,fo33wnq,t1_fo2rhu1,1587480071.0,Yeah ngl made me laugh

Persona5,fnzi592,t1_fnz6mxn,1587394524.0,Exactly. I'm not in Reddit all the time so I don't even notice reposts unless it's super excessive. One repost isn't gonna kill anybody.
