love,fr0qb3i,t1_fr00v1s,1589803957.0,"If his wife is good person and his relationship has been good for far she shouldn’t leave. He should work on it. IK it’s might be hard for you, but marriage is work, and maybe it’s his midlife crisis. I’d encourage him to go to couple’s therapy and focus his energies on his real long term marriage not a potential future partner"
love,fr0q4an,t1_fqzo8g7,1589803808.0,He might lie about having gotten it! Be careful
amwf,fqcivt1,t1_fqc07p5,1589259373.0,Oh maybe! If you don’t have an Apple decide you can still watch it live (with comments) or after. But that’s a good idea!

USC,fp8kt3o,t3_gbzuah,1588394953.0,"No no! NYU’s great. I got into USC as well and my sister goes there. I’m investigating to what extent lavish amenities created by NYU and USC to attract students actual draw them to there. These extra amenities hike up the tuition prices and if universities were to lowered these spendings, covid-19 assistance and tuition refunds might become easier to advocate for."
USC,fp8d5jv,t1_fp8d3h0,1588389341.0,What course is it? Could you speak more about it?
sex,foqplho,t1_foq8whu,1587998482.0,Yes!! Ask her.

relationships,fixhan5,t3_fad0pe,1582820381.0,"I don’t know if you should tell the wife just yet. I think you should encourage the affair to stop and for the man to seek help first. If you’re able to help him become a better person without telling the wife right away, that could be more helpful."
nyu,fgj5ldk,t3_eytcf7,1580837411.0,Same! The therapy appointments are also so hard to get that it’s unhelpful. But they can refere you elsewhere!
Jokes,ff9ujdu,t1_ff7xqbc,1579721678.0,Yes I know.
relationships,ff9229c,t1_ff8yhup,1579702915.0,Oh wow YES YES I’m so glad ppl are saying this!!!!! Please hear them out!
BPD,ff3tgq0,t3_ereaxj,1579548488.0,"No judgement at all I totally get where this is coming from. Would it work for you to tell your boyfriend you don't like him hanging out with other women by himself and ask if you can come with? If that sounds too harsh maybe just say you'd love to meet her. or whomever it is next time that situation arrises, and ask if he minds if you tag along. Honestly, if he does mind, then he is wrong and you have every right to be upset- just maybe argue with him instead of going out?"
BPD,fdsssjb,t3_emyry4,1578707477.0,One day at a time! I hope that each days gets better and not just passable ❤️
BPD,fbupf0y,t1_fbualek,1577118248.0,I’m really glad! I’m happy your boyfriend’s there for you :)))
BPD,fbtk7wj,t3_ee8ups,1577082031.0,How are you feeling now?
nyu,fai5osq,t3_e97bbk,1576100375.0,They took it from my financial aid but then I’m pretty sure they reimbursed me.
nyu,f8bauav,t1_f8a747l,1574432234.0,You’re really simplifying people’s experience and disrespecting how NYU failed to stop their crisis from escalating. NYU is much more worried about image than anything else- my psychiatrist told me I was being a pussy for saying I had thoughts of self harm- and nothing. I got punished- not he. So be careful of what you’re defending. Not advocating for real mental care could actually cost lives.
