UnusAnnus,fn8iyb1,t3_g02vjz,1586742714.0,"I have one spooky story. When I was younger around 8 or so I was asleep on the couch at my dad's. Everyone in the house was sleeping and my dad's door was opened enough to see his closet. I ended up waking up for some reason looking over at the bedroom door and all I see is this dark figure with glowing eyes. At first I didn't know what to think being so young, but I thought I saw it moving... So I screamed as loud as I could and I remember my dad etc. Turning on the lights running to see what was wrong and I look over and it was just a pile of clothes but of course I was still spooked. Then once I calmed down and everyone went back to sleep, when all the lights were off... I look over to see the clothes as the glowing eyes appeared again. So I put my head under my blanket and managed to fall back asleep. It was a weird night."
Anxiety,feiqsci,t3_ep1iu7,1579144873.0,"So I'm a huge soccer fan and used to play a lot when I was younger. I've been trying to start playing again and do some drop ins near my city but my anxiety normally gets in the way and I talk myself out of it. However Monday night I decided to go to one and had a great time now I'm considering joining a league near me, this definitely helped my confidence we will see where it goes :)"
Anxiety,fdii3hp,t3_elibbr,1578443413.0,"I tend to sometimes lose my appetite when I get anxious and I never can eat anything in those times. So I end up drinking lots of water to stay hydrated, and water tends to help with my anxiety. Then once I feel okay again I eat something small like a fruit cup with chia seeds (it's really good for you and is a little bit filling after I didn't have an appetite)"
Anxiety,fdihi01,t3_elf74v,1578443032.0,"I have that issue too, I haven't had much luck with having many good friends irl growing up and so I kind of closed myself off because people always hurt me in the end so I turned to people online who related, plus it's way easier talking to someone over text about my problems or even just everyday conversations than it is in real life. For me i always feel like people don't really care what I have to say, so I say nothing at all. I've always been a quiet person, and tend to open up to people I really trust but even then I can't always become vocal about what's on my mind to anyone. And it sucks, but it's something I hope to work on in the future."
Anxiety,fdicj6a,t3_elis98,1578439817.0,"I was diagnosed with anxiety the year after I graduated highschool and was put on medication (I forgot what I was put on, due to the fact I only used it for a month, and never went back due to life things) but since then I did a lot of research about CBD and how other people used it, what did they like etc. Now I have used a CBD balm that you apply for sore muscles or can even help with anxiety before I used oil. I have personally had great luck with using CBD oil/gummies for anxiety. I usually will buy the oil at 200mg or so (I currently am using 200mg bottle, at 7mg per serving) I find this mg at just the right amount so I can calm myself down yet still be productive and awake. Yet everyone is has a different reaction to it.  I also use CBD gummies on occasion (to me gummies are more for sleeping or if I want to just watch movies etc) but the mg I have in the gummy form is 360mg at 15mg per serving. Not sure if I like that mg or not yet. If you're looking to try CBD for anxiety I'd definitely recommend using oil first. And of possible pick a flavor something you would like it makes it easier to use, when you use oil if you don't vape it, you let it sit under your tongue for a sec and swallow. The only brand I have used is green garden gold there products are phenomenal. I thought about trying something different but I have success with their products. Hope this helps!"
Anxiety,fack685,t3_e8f5yv,1575941150.0,"I normally don't lose weight however, when I get anxious I sometimes get tired, or just lose my appetite for a couple hours, I try and buy little snacks like crackers so I'm consuming something throughout the day until I get home and have dinner. But sometimes I just don't feel like eating lunch and whatnot because I feel so overwhelmed sometimes. But just keep working on it, maybe try slowly adding things or get more little snacks that have some nutritional value. You got this!"

AutoPaint,ew8aee0,t1_ew759fp,1565206558.0,"We were using rotary buffers like Makita etc. Now we switched over  to mainly Rupes. We use all there buffing compounds, as well as buffers. For pads we get some pads by rupes and other pads by urotec. They focus on mainly random orbital buffing style, which I now prefer over your standard rotary. As with the random orbitals it's one step only (normally). The two I have are LHR21 2 and i just bought the LHR21 3 last week absolutely love it!"
