I was on Zoloft and amphetamines on top of that. It was building up for a while, but the moment it all blew up was when I was playing hockey. I hit someone with my hockey stick and almost took down the ref. I got kicked out, but refused to leave. They had to cancel the rest of the game.   


I've never felt so out of control of my own actions before, but at the same time I felt like I was sticking up for myself."
bipolar,f7n2hai,t3_dx2b2r,1573881756.0,I haven't been hypo-manic in a long time and quite frankly I miss it so much. I was so productive and I could be really happy for no reason. Lately I've been stuck in a multi-year depression and it's been really unpleasant.

bipolar2,f7mxcm5,t3_dwdkf2,1573876667.0,"How is the anxiety? Although I felt like a zombie on Latuda and Abilify, I had debilitating anxiety. It got so bad that my doctor and I decided that we should stop taking medication. While I like being medication-free, it's actually not going well at all. I'm just thinking about what medication should be next when I'll have to face the consequences with my doctor."
