I was just bored lmao It’s fault of writting for all this „plot holes” for characters story. I still love Bobby the most from any character anyway, because I think that his personality is developed in the most detailed way + however he treats MC he doesn’t seem to give up on her to the very end. Also because of the „playboy” comment on mean tweets I think that person who wrote him is actually aware that in real life his action could be taken as geniue or snakey. 
Plus to be honest, love island is still the best dating sim I ever played, with soooo many choices, so it’s not 100% trash lol But i think that if devs took more time it could be wayyyy more interesting and replayable."

So it doesn’t look for me as decision made out of guilt, more like one to save his face out of this drama. And I agree that it wasn’t big deal, but also kinda out of his character since he officialy states that he hates any kind of drama, and despite what would result be - ON was 100% going to cause one. Also if he’s coupled up with MC and Hope is her bff it’s kind of disrespectful that he doesn’t care what you think. There isn’t any „Maybe MC is right, I think it’s too much”, if you say that you don’t want to be part of it or that Hope is your friend.

I read on other comments that you often change your places of work - I’m college student so, I don’t have that possibility, but from 6 months - 1 year I always end up to be friends with completly other people than before. People like me, and I’m always nice to everyone + hardworking, my family is really supportive of me and I have huge amount of luck in my life. My apparence it’s not like 10/10, but thanks to my character mask I get some attention from opposite gender who supposed to be out of my league. But even though everyone likes me, I personally hate myself, and think of myself as someone weird and cringey. Never been in relationship, even if I had chance with decent boys, since I cringed that they liked me and ran away. When I have obvious shot with someone, I make myself think that it’s all in my head, and I could never make someone take interest in me. Never truely liked any of my friends, even though they were amazing and felt guilty and sorry because of it. Got into dream college and felt numb, when I expected to be happy. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Just trying my best every fucking day, but every minute I feel as someone worse from anybody else. And after achievieng my dream goal, not feeling happy but rather guilty that I could make even better."

toastme,f5be30d,t1_f5b7zfe,1572120346.0,"I’m also really socially awkward person, I rarley do parties and my first week in college, meeting new people, was hell. I’m also kinda having some thoughts that most ppl perceive me as weird or in other negative way. I’m not saying that getting rid of this all things, that’s in our head, is easy.  My self confidence is like 0, even that deep down I know that everything is pretty normal about me.

So like I said, I know that it isn’t easy, but trying and fighting with those feelings kinda makes sense out of our lifes. Most ppl are mean, and aren’t going to give you unconditionally help, so you can’t ALWAYS wait for something. I push myself to people and other things by thinking of theese 3 things:
1. If you do something embrassing, other person won’t give a fuck, since they give most amount of their attention to their lifes, not your failures
2. If you don’t risk few things, you will regret that to the end of your life. You can’t go back in time, but you’re creating your past right now
3. At the end, all of us are going to be dead. So actually not many things matter so much, as you think about them now 

Also when life is becoming too hard to me, I’m telling myself to live it in that very minute, if it’s too hard then in that particular second. 

If you have depression, going to specialist can help. I can share my advices and opinion, but some things cannot be replaced, for ex. medications. 

Good luck :D"

Drugs change people a lot, and to be honest i don’t think he even really liked this girl with who he was later. It was just easy way out from being sober and acting like actual human being which needs some effort. I think that there aren’t an actual decent „bad boys” types like from the movies, but i believe that there are out there somewhere people who experienced stories like this from „Fault in our stars” or maybe like Ron&Hermiona from „Harry Potter” (aside this all magic stuff ofc lol). Again I’m really sorry and I hope you’re doing alright. You must be very good and understanding person if you gave him another chance and also really strong mentally to deal with this kind of trash & try to or completly move on."
