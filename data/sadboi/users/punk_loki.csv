lossofalovedone,fr6kp09,t1_fr6j2bx,1589928036.0,"I am just annoyed at people who are not depressed or suicidal to any degree and yet still talk about it as if they are 

It is possible to be suicidal without actively wanting to end your own life. I think it‚Äôs called being passively suicidal. Maybe you just don‚Äôt mind dying or maybe you take some risks like drinking too much or not wearing your seatbelt or something. You can still get help with this, you don‚Äôt have to wait until you are very sick before seeking help. 

Also depression can manifest as just apathy and not caring, it is not all feeling terribly sad all the time. Depression is complicated. It is also not always 24/7. You can have periods of feeling fine even if you are in the middle of a depressive episode. (Also depression is not always episodes but I am bipolar and not sure how *depression* depression works) 

Also I think that being passively suicidal can be caused by things that are not just depression. 

I hope you feel better :)"
UNC,fr5u5s2,t3_gmsnby,1589914717.0,"Participation for the classes I had usually was about 15% of the grade and included attendance and class activities/ just speaking up in class. For attendance you should show up to every class and not arrive too late or leave too early (like 15 min is probably too much) but basically as long as you show up it‚Äôs better than being late. If something comes up just email your professor. Most professors will be understanding. If you are sick you can get a doctors note and I think professors have to excuse you if you have a doctors note. I skipped classes last year and got all B‚Äôs and I really wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. As a rule just go to class it will just work out way better.

Edit; TLDR + some extra: 

yes you can skip class without an excuse but it will bring down your grade and make it harder to understand the subject matter. Not only can you be graded down on skipping you could also miss important discussions or class activities which would bring your grade down further. Class participation is often about 15% of the grade. 

but also skipping class will make your professor dislike you and so it will be harder to get them to help you out later on and they probably won‚Äôt be as lenient. As a rule you should try to get your professor to like you so that if you hit a hard spot they will be more willing to help you out"
