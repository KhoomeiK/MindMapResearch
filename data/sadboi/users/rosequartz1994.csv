Anxiety,fqbvgkx,t3_gi0j2q,1589244705.0,Oh hell yeah. Under-stimulation makes you over think yourself into a panic. Hate this :(
notliketheothergirls,fqbv5zp,t3_gi0gdw,1589244540.0,"I am a girl who loves makeup, I must not eat."
AMA,fqbux70,t1_fqbpwv3,1589244406.0,That makes sense. Are you insecure about your appearance ?
OCD,fqbuv1w,t1_fqbt4p9,1589244373.0,"Hehe like you had a panic attack and the guy thought it meant you were obsessed with him? Maybe I misread haha. 

Yeah you‚Äôre questioning yourself ... I totally get it lol."

OCD,fqbsm4l,t3_gi01oq,1589243119.0,"I think you already know the right thing to do! That‚Äôs not how OCD works, also does he think he‚Äôs some kind of god? Ew I don‚Äôt like the way he‚Äôs treating you. But in the same regard, no judgement and I know you‚Äôll make the right choice."
OCD,fqbrqcv,t3_ghysh5,1589242633.0,"Hey!!!! You are so strong for attempting ERP on your own. It means you‚Äôre really sick of feeling this bs, which is really really real and scary in our minds. In my opinion erp is the most effective way to handle obsessions. That is how I got over my obsession with harm ocd that tortured me. You will soon realize there is nothing to fear."
Empaths,fqbqcey,t3_ghz64f,1589241874.0,"Hey there! First of all, yay for going back to work! Jobs are super hard as an empath. Working retail as an empath sucked , and I wanted an office job. Now that I have an office job, I miss retail. Sometimes being around people that test our sensitivities (within reason) can be good and make us stronger. I trust you will make the right decision."
AMA,fqbptlo,t3_ghzf2x,1589241589.0,Does this make you feel better?

OCD,fq8kkvq,t3_ghfrdc,1589168375.0,"Hey! Fellow ocd sufferer here. First of all congratulations, it seems you‚Äôve made some great strides. Sadly ocd doesn‚Äôt just go away. It‚Äôs kind of like just when things are getting better it wants to taunt you and test you. I don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre going through but upon reading your post I can tell you are a really intelligent and self aware person. Hope you feel better and have a good night. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
Anxiety,fq8k5tp,t1_fq8e146,1589168092.0,"The best way to describe it is like an electric shock. Anxiety is a real bitch though it‚Äôs convinced me of many, many, things... what are the feelings making you think it‚Äôs a zap? My panic attacks can kinda make me feel like I‚Äôm blacking out for a few minuteS (like I‚Äôm there but not really there)"

Anxiety,fh1p9xm,t3_f1345q,1581220267.0,"Hey love! You are dealing with intrusive thoughts. I used to(and still) have really scary ones involving death etc. the key is to just not let them effect you, easier said than done for sure. Your brain is searching for ‚Äúsigns‚Äù and things to cling to because our brains are constantly trying to protect us from danger(existent or not). The fact that you are even having these concerns shows you care a lot about your life. Xoxo"

The biggest one is to test the waters and honestly just say... come at me bro to the anxiety. You are not your anxiety! Once you challenge it as a separate entity to yourself you gain more control. Also annoying but true , exercise and routine. Feel free to pm me for more tips this is kinda my life, navigating this bullshit so I found some hacks"
