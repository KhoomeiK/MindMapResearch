As a nurse I have experienced my fair share of “back-stabbing” and it isn’t getting any better unfortunately, the saying “seniors are eating their young” is pretty accurate. Whilst, doctors have each other’s back, nurses are pretty bad when it comes to providing support. 

All I can say is talk to your manager, escalate this to the matron of the department if nothing is being actioned. Also aren’t you supposed to be on your preceptorship program? Do you have a preceptorship coordinator because that’s a person who can really coordinate your learning and get your concerns forwarded.

Please continue to practice WITHIN your limitations DO NOT do anything that you have not been trained to do, and watch yourself. Be aware of the nurses around you and how they act because sometimes the best thing is just to be extra careful when they are on shift. Sometimes it’s the culture that becomes pretty toxic too and it can sometimes go against newbies.

There were several studies done by imperial which have warned government of the lack of response if a pandemic was to hit by the NHS they have warned that there was no system in place to respond in a timely manner... also the shortage of PPE was expected 4 years ago with imperial asking govs to order PPE in case a pandemic was to hit.

Whilst Italy was showing how things have changed then the government finally realised we are not far behind which was way too late. 
 

There is no inconsistency in advice in terms of PPE... the WHO has set guidelines which should have been followed however Public health England decided due to the shortage that we have high risk areas like icu only get the PPE (if lucky).

CoronavirusUK,fmapk9x,t1_fmaomz3,1585902740.0,"It’s not that we don’t appreciate we do... but the conditions we work in compared to other countries like South Korea are horrifically bad... we did sign up to “help” but putting our life on the line due to the lack of PPE not even clapping can make that fact ago away... we have one nurse who died this week due to the inadequate PPE and another one fighting for her life on the ventilator, whilst we lost 5 doctors... no clapping can cast the fact that we probably will loose more colleagues due to a little avoidable thing PPE!!! 


Clapping is fine and good but most of us know that when this is over people will go back to their normal life’s and will take the nhs for granted we will still get our regular patients who spit, kick us and shout abuse... that’s a given.... we know... maybe this is why some don’t appreciate it because they don’t want to get “used” to it"
CoronavirusUK,fmapatk,t1_fmanzyn,1585902450.0,Of course they are which is sad but at least we nurses finally get a pay rise
CoronavirusUK,fmaoqso,t1_fmamatv,1585901831.0,Yep that’s what I’m waiting for...
Nurse,fmai6px,t1_fmaewpn,1585894968.0,That’s helpful thank you :)
Nurse,fm95ct4,t3_ftqd5e,1585862018.0,Our government has decreased PPE protection which is not in line with the WHO recommendations.... we are being told to “calm down” by the government and lost 1 nurse today whilst another is on the ventilator on our icu trying to fight for her life.... people higher up need to take this serious... they are literally setting us up for failure with that attitude of “stay calm not gonna happen here”
nhs,fm71rfg,t3_fthfvf,1585810178.0,"Truthfully, At the moment unless you can’t physically breathe or struggle to do so that will get you into hospital... about the extra treatment the nhs cannot give out any “extra treatment”. Ventilators are given out on an individual basis determined by what the survival chances are of the patient. 

I recommend your dad should stay home keep a constant eye on him. If he end up in hospital only the people who have a fair chance of survival will get vents. Which is main treatment for covid."
