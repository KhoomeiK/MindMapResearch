depression,ev23z88,t3_ci33ao,1564170069.0,"I’m sorry, I’m a woman w/ depression and stretch marks, a lot of them. I don’t think the stretch marks are the problem. Honestly. It may be for you, and the way you are seeing yourself and maybe you’re projecting that in other people. The right person won’t care about that. At any rate, you can always go to a dermatologist that can help w/ the marks, maybe not remove them but help improve their appearance."

depression,ev1i2jh,t3_ci2azk,1564158861.0,"I think the first thing you should do is tell this voice to fuck off, take a shower with the best smelling soap and shampoo you have, cry in the shower while fighting your demons if you have to. Stay in there for hours if necessary. Once you feel like the water has washed away enough of the bad feeling, get dressed w/ whatever you feel like wearing. After you’re done all that, you get that perfume and spray on your wrist. Smell it, let all the good memories and good feelings that the smell is connected to come back to you and flood your mind and remember the good times. It WILL make you feel better. If you have to cry some more, do so. Then go have a snack. It will not solve all your problems. But it will be the first step."
depression,ev1hjad,t3_ci16z5,1564158537.0,"A couple of things:

1- just because it looks like people have their shit together on social media, doesn’t mean they do. Chances are they feel the same way you do right now.

2- you should talk to your doctor about it. I know exactly how you feel and I know you don’t see the point in doing so. But you still should. 

Everyone is different and depression triggers differently to each of us. But the questioning you’re having right now is a big sign. You shouldn’t try to ride it out by yourself. Talk to someone that can actually help, might not seem like it, but once someone is helping, the ‘point of things’ start to come back."
depression,ev1ea8r,t3_cd0hjp,1564156806.0,"The worst for me is when people call me ‘strong’.. because I’m able to function and hide well what goes in my mind from others, I’m ‘strong’ I disagree, being ‘strong’ is what sent me down the rabbit hole."
veronicamars,euopt08,t1_eum2yze,1563945184.0,"I agree. And honestly, I hope it backfires on him. Veronica Mars always kicked ass, Logan was her supporter and also the one that brought her back to earth. RT thinking no female character can succeed without going through pain? God forbid a career-oriented married woman be happy on a TV show. Even if there is a S5, I will not watch it. The show died with Logan."
relationships,eruek6t,t1_eruclfd,1561275361.0,"See, that's what intrigues me. I know we must love ourselves and see our worth before someone else can. But when you read it in books, these characters are never self loathing. They are fine by themselves, then it just so happens that they meet someone and boom; all they thought they knew and needed is out the window and they discover they were 'incomplete'. 

Like I said, I'm down to earth, I never expect anything from anyone. I am happy being just me and I love myself. So all relationships I had, when they weren't going the way I thought they should, I got out of them. I've never been swept off my feet. 

It's what makes me question if that type of love exists, something we didn't think we needed, because we were happy with ourselves until it proves it all wrong. And I don't mean the type that controls and suffocates you. I mean the type that inspires and makes you be even better."

But the relationship was never easy, and I thought I had to fight for it because 'til death do us part', until the day my gut told me the relationship had run it's course, he came into my life for a reason, and once that reason was settled with, it was time to part ways. I trusted the universe."

relationships,er5uy59,t3_c0lmkp,1560534022.0,"I think you both need therapy, separately, and once you each figure out what's going on in your own minds, then couple's therapy. Everyone goes through stuff, how you handle it is what makes the difference, specially when there are kids involved. 

Going through things like that and not really working through it, makes both people resentful, and that creates a really bad vibe for the kids, even if they don't know exactly what's happening, they know something is off. I was that kid, I knew it, no one had to tell me. 

To be a good husband and father, you first need to be good with yourself. Talk to someone, a professional. It will help. I wish my parents had done so."
relationships,er5sjxw,t1_er5n1we,1560532617.0,"It's really hard to hear from someone we love that they don't feel the same way. I've been there. I'm there right now too. At least you can get some closure that the times you had together were happy and this is a clean break up if it happens, and not an ugly one that would leave you scared and hurt. She's being very thoughtful of your feelings and from the sounds of it, you of hers too. She will appreciate how you treat her and deal with it too."
relationships,er4iise,t3_c0gij0,1560493314.0,"It sounds to me like the relationship has run its course. It happens. Sometimes people come into our lives for a reason, and they stay for how long they're supposed to and then it's time to move on. I know it's a shitty reason/answer, I know it's not objective and direct. But sometimes that's just how it is. We can't see or understand why when it's happening. Trust the universe. 

If she says there's nothing you can do to fix it, then believe her. I'm sure this is hurting her a lot too, if she feels as guilty about things as you said, she's probably having issues with this for a while and pulling if off would just add more to her stress. 

Maybe all that love just turned into friendship love. Be supportive, explain to her that whatever she decides, you understand (even if you don't right away) and that no matte what, you'll still be her friend and be there for her if she needs it."
relationships,er4htut,t3_c0f0v4,1560492500.0,"I think next time you see a girl you like, first ask her if she has a boyfriend. If she does then that should be enough for you to not create expectations. If she doesn't and you decide to go through with it, maybe try and make sure she knows your intentions beforehand instead of playing the friend card. 

I've had guys I liked in the past come talk to me years later and the subject came up, but just because I liked in the past, doesn't mean I liked them now.

I think you've been unlucky. Just try and be more direct, but also respectful at the same time."
relationships,er4hivx,t3_c09ans,1560492145.0,"Going through the same right now. It's normal to think back at the good days, and want it back. But just think that there was more than that that happened. If there wasn't you wouldn't have broker up. 

I broker up because I knew we weren't right for each other, before anyone cheated, got resentful or started hating each other, we decided to go our own way. 

It's good to have good memories from a relationship, shows that it was a good one while it lasted. Keep the good memories, it will get better with time. But also remember why it din't work out."
relationships,er4h19d,t3_c0ed7g,1560491592.0,"Today marks 1 week since I broke up with by BF for the similar reasons. Tomorrow, June 14th would have been our 2nd year anniversary, so this subject is raw enough for me to give you a heart to heart. 

As much as it hurts, if after two years you still don't have your life together and your future figured out, chances are it's not going to work out. 

In my case, not only had neither of us said we loved each other, even though I DID love him, but deep down I was always hesitant into asking him to move in with me. After an honest conversation and me pushing him to be honest with me, the truth came out, he cared DEEPLY for me, like he's never cared for anyone before, but he had never been in love with me. It hurt to hear it. It hurt a lot, but I DO believe I deserve better than that. I love him deeply and it was hard breaking up, but I didn't see it working out. 

Now I say the situation is similar because I'm 30 and he is 40. So the age gap is similar to yours, and let me tell you something that older friends have told me: Men at a certain age, if they don't have it figured out already or are hesitant, it's because either they're comfortable the way it is and don't want/think anything should change, or they're not invested, not truly. My now ex was supper attentive, kind, present, genuinely the best BF i've had. But he wasn't in love with me. And it hurt him too when he had to come into terms and be honest about it. 

So be what it may, take time to think if it's good for your mental health to 'wait to see if he loves me'. In my opinion, when you have to question it, it's because you know the answer, and you should do what's best for YOU."
harrypotter,er4cagg,t3_c0cyxg,1560486767.0,"Hopefully with all these new e-books coming out about different subjects from Hogwarts and what not they will make one about wands too. Your questions are very interesting, I would love to know more too."
harrypotter,er4bl7g,t3_c0cz0n,1560486164.0,"I remember when I found out he would die before reading the book. I was at a museum with my cousin, and this guy from Australia having a really hard time to get tickets to the museum and struggling with the language (I'm originally from Brazil and this happened there). So I introduce myself and offer to help him, he was very appreciative and happy with the offer. So we go about our day and start talking about Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. I knew someone would die, but wasn't sure who, I don't have a problem with spoilers, so we decided to play a game, guess who. Anyway, I found out it was Dumbledore and was shocked cause I couldn't see how the series would go on without him. Needless to say when I finally got the book I didn't put it down until it was done."

&#x200B;

Muggles have this game where they hide a prize and then give kids a map to find. This seems easy enough, but when you introduce spells, charms, transfigured objects, potions and...well... MAGIC, it gives it a more interesting vibe to it. 

The prize can be something your little wizard/witch really want, either a new broom, fancy robes, new cauldron all you eat chocolate frogs, a trip to Romania to see Dragons or a pair of tickets for the next Quidditch World Cup. But you do make them work for it. 

Find a safe spot to hide the prize, should be easy enough with protecting spells so the little ones can't easily find it. 

Create a map or list, with one clue to start and a location for them to go, the objective is for your young wizard to solve the first riddle, and find the next. You can start with a riddle, once solved and the second spot discovered, the next step could be brewing a potion to reveal the 3rd spot, and so on until they find the last spot and solve the last task to get their prize.

Locations can be chosen at the discretion of the parents. You can make it simple enough so they're in the surrounding areas of where your family lives, or go all out and create port-keys taking your young wizard to new countries and giving them the chance to meet witches and wizards from all over the World. 

This leaves the parents a lot of room to test your young wizard's skills and how much they've learned in school but having fun while doing so. 

&#x200B;

**Summer Exchange Kid-swap**

Send your young Wizard or Witch in an adventure in another country. The program works in conjunction with parents from other countries. You send your child to a magical family in another country, say Brazil for example, and welcome the child from that family into your own home for the summer. Giving the chance for the children to not only visit a different country, but also learn different magical cultures and customs, new spells and enchantments. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity."
harrypotter,er45l5b,t3_c0eknz,1560481647.0,"In the books, when Hagrid is taking Harry shopping and Harry asks about the houses after meeting Malfoy, Harry says he thinks he might be in Hufflepuff, and Hagrid says: "" Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin. There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."" In the movies this line is delivered by Ron during the ceremony when Malfoy gets sorted. I think that because this was delivered so early on in the book that it just stays in our heads and makes us have this pre-idea that ALL Slytherins are bad. To be honest they don't make much of a good case for themselves as the series goes on, but some that's not to say that ALL of them are bad, but maybe majority? That's not to say that there aren't bad apples in the other houses too. Peter Pettigrew for example."
