depression,f6ju8hi,t3_drhxbr,1572900298.0,"The people that are using the religion card should be listening to you more, I’m sorry that they aren’t. For me, when people throw out the religion card it sends the signal that they don’t have time for me or that they think I’m this way because my soul “isn’t saved” or whatever.

One thing I will say though is that finding my own practice has worked wonders for my depression. What I’ve learned is if no one else will listen to me or knows what to say to help me, then I need to try to listen to myself. I’m journaling (look up The Holistic Psychologists “Future Self Journal” if you’re interested) and am doing chakra work. Both help me tune in to my own brain and make me aware of what I need and what I am going through. 

I know that might seem like me telling you to turn to religion like everyone else is but what I’m mainly getting at is to treat finding your own sense of happiness and comfort like a religion. If anyone brings up religion again, just say you’ve already found yours :)"
nofriends,f5xrcgg,t3_dpl58h,1572545108.0,It’s not abnormal to not relate to people or to have surface level friendships but I do think deep friendships with the right people can make life a lot better. Keep pursuing your interests and inviting people to hang that you think you click with. The right ones will stick around and want to hang.
nofriends,f5tjcen,t3_dp2ytz,1572459834.0,"Happy birthday! 
Life is hard and being a teenager is REALLY hard. I’m 23 and have found so many ways to make friends AKA your window definitely isn’t closing. I know it’s super annoying to read but hobbies are a great way to find people to befriend (rock climbing, video games, volunteer groups). Remember, we are all in this life alone essentially and traditional friendships aren’t required. Make friends online or learn to be your own friend. But today, you are 18 and are fighting really hard. Celebrate yourself."

SuicideWatch,f5tilou,t1_f5t2fbk,1572459412.0,"Fear is a lot of what stops me from suicide too. I toy with the idea of reincarnation and would hate to abandon this life for a much shittier one (even though I wouldn’t be conscious of my past life). 

I hate that you’re suffering too but it’s reassuring to hear that you are pushing through it for your daughter. As a daughter myself with a hard working father I can tell you, it means a lot. I hope are able to find some more joy in your life soon."

depression,f5iow5o,t3_dnwieb,1572216623.0,Happy birthday! You’re a badass for hanging in there
nofriends,ew2xr6q,t3_cmj3pz,1565058549.0,"I know how it feels. Even when I think I have friends, shit ALWAYS falls through on my birthday. On that note, keep trying and putting yourself out there. You’ll find one person some day who understands you. Until then, you’ve got a community of people here who are happy to celebrate you. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!"
