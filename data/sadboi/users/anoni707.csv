AskMenAdvice,fqmfsu6,t3_gjj5ij,1589476730.0,"Female here. I had a colleague who said he was in love with me, while I didn‚Äôt felt the same. Although I think that he still has those feelings for me (even after two years) I am still friends with him and he knows me the best within the work space. I know he knows it wont work and i dont have the same feelings. He respects that and leaves me alone when I dont answer his texts. I think giving her space is an important factor.

i believe its possible to be ok with it for either party, depends per girl though. I would say to text/tell her how you feel (afraid of making her uncomfortable/afraid friendship changes etc) and that you hope your friendship stays the same, as you cherish that. 
Tell/say it in a way you feel most comfortable with!

Borderline,fnstsww,t3_g3p8qu,1587228657.0,"English is not my native language*

Although I dont think I am a pro in giving advices. I would recommend you to read into BPD first (alot!). For me personally, I often need confirmations and alot of communication and patience from the other person. This can be often seen with BPD. Not getting that means the rollercoaster goes downhill. I dont want to scare you or anything, but it could be a toughie for someone who has avoidant attachment style i think.. 

If both of you work on the issues and communicate with each other. It would be the best thing you could do right? 

I hope this kinda helps. Wish you best of luck!"

Try to find people you can talk in English with (gaming or so?). 
Also, English movies and music wouldn‚Äôt hurt :) so you hear the pronunciations and familiarize with the words.

Worked in a tourist area where I had to use English everyday. It got up to a point i wouldn‚Äôt know the words in my own language anymore. 

Now that I‚Äôm not using it anymore on a daily basis. I would say the fluency of speaking it deteriorate after 8months or so.

This goes with all languages though (speaking 3 languages and learned 2 other languages I didn‚Äôt bothered to invest more time in)

He once had a drink with me and some other colleagues and he just bluntly said to me that im weird. I looked at him with a wtf face and just ignored it.

 I‚Äôm trilingual(?) and born and raised in the country im living in. I dont look like the citizens here so ‚Äúim foreign‚Äù. I was at my doctors appointment and said something about consistency.

I was sitting in the train wearing a skirt. This guy passed me by (wanting to sit somewhere else), comes back and sits in front of me. He was staring down there.
I got uncomfertable and put my bag on my lap, while he still keeps staring. He grabbed something from the floor (i thought) while still staring. Stared at my down there for full 20min without making eye contact. 
Something about this all freaked me out so much. I was texting my friends how scared i was, didnt even dared to try texting in a language he could be familiar with(i know 3languages)
My friends say i had to get up and move somewhere else but i was just too scared to do anything!
I just tried to endure it but hell.. its one of the most scariest time in my life
(Probably because he did not even ONCE made eyecontact with me or anyone else and just stared!)
Sorry English not my first language :)

For the next time maybe call a friend?

Edit: while i arrived at my destination, he saw me wanting to get up. He quickly-while still staring there- bend over -still staring- picked up his bag of m&m‚Äôs!! Say what??? He put them on the floor , just so he could pick them up again to see whether he could see my panties. O my god!"
