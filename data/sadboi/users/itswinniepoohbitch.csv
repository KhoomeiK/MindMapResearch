AskReddit,fhlg7mm,t3_f3i60f,1581700334.0,"((sorry in advance how lengthy this is))

I'm a cashier at a drugstore and this regular (guy around mid 20s maybe) came in with his uncle and kept asking me questions about where certain products were. when the uncle went to get the products they were looking for, the nephew hung back and kept ""complimenting"" me, telling me how ""pretty my eyes are"" and how ""smooth and pale my skin is"". when his uncle came back, he ""reprimanded"" his nephew, saying that he was ""being very rude to this gorgeous young lady"". the younger man sucked his teeth and defended himself by saying ""come on, I'm just having fun. you know how much I've been lusting after her ever since shes started working here."" at the time I was 19 and had only been working there for about 6 months, and was nearing my 19th birthday when I initially applied. his uncle argued that he couldnt just have me all to himself, and that perhaps they could ""share"", since he too had wanted to put his hands on me for quite a while. then they went into detail about the positions they wanted to have me in that I just cant even repeat it's that disgusting. I was just trying to ignore them in hope that they would stop, but of course not. they asked me what I was doing after my shift (it was a weekday) so I lied and told them that I had homework to do. they asked me if I go to college and which one but I lied and told them that I was actually in high school. the nephew didnt believe me and asked if I was like a senior or something, so I shook my head and corrected him, ""no, I'm a sophomore."" they were both in disbelief and when they asked exactly how old I was I said ""I'm just 16."" I have never seen two grown men run so fast out of my store, its truly disgusting :/"

relationship_advice,f0fmw6g,t3_d4nen2,1568585955.0,"14 year olds can be assholes sometimes, but in the the long run yall are still kids and being an asshole is acceptable for right now. I would try to gossip less with them and try to establish some boundaries with them. or maybe find some new friends? you dont necessarily have to end your friendship with them but maybe find some other people who you share the same vibe as you"
relationship_advice,f0flv21,t3_d4ixbl,1568585470.0,I recently got out of a 2 year long relationship and for the entire 2 years my ex made me feel like shit for talking to people that she didnt like or wanted me to be friends with. so a lot of my friends were her friends and after the breakup I had no one to talk to anymore. I'm putting myself out there again and I've found someone that I really like but every time I talk to him I feel that same immense guilt. every time I go out or talk to someone I can practically feel my ex breathing on my neck and I know how incredibly difficult it is to ignore that instinct (which actually isnt an instinct of mine at all but was instilled in me by my ex). my advice to you is to know or to start learning your worth because as soon as you learn what you're willing to deal with it makes a world of difference. I hope nothing but the best for you dude
