skinsTV,fqvetei,t3_gkwoif,1589675758.0,I first saw it when I was 21. Loved it. Just started rewatching it and it’s really still quite lovely and resonating.
skinsTV,fqompt0,t3_gk2fkc,1589518958.0,"“Better” is so subjective. I feel like I can’t avoid this debate. It happens all the time with the “Degrassi” crowd. 

You realize season 1 was great but so awkward and rough Antoine the edges and odd in a lot of ways. You know that the creators formed a team of mostly early 20’s writers who didn’t know how to juggle tv story long form so they decided to come up with the idea of only focusing on one character per episode? (Don’t get me wrong, it’s actually one of my favorite things about the show) 

Season 2 had a lot of great things going for it. But season 3 and 4 also had some great episodes and moments. That’s part of the problem with each episode being about just one character - it can feel really imbalanced. 

No single season of Skins is flawless. There’s good and there’s bad. There’s insane and ridiculous. 

The last generation, I know people didn’t love it, but it also had some good storytelling towards the end of season 5 and throughout season 6. 

Skins was never a perfect show. In fact, sometimes it’s hard to go back to the first season, and I say that as someone who grew up loving the show. Thank god it just didn’t follow the first gen for 6 seasons. That would’ve been awful."

Skins wasn’t even the “most popular” in the UK but it was liked by a lot of people and ran for 7 seasons so that tells you something."

Other than some weird and bizarre things around season 6 and 7, where there were things they would *slightly* edit around. For example, Ashley and Jimmy attempting to have sex while he was in the wheelchair, the original Canadian broadcast showed the full thing, while iTunes/American broadcast would shave off seconds to not spend too much time on the sexy stuff. 

Also, the vending machines or beverages and stuff. I would assume it had to do with legal differences between Canada and the us. If you watch degrassi on an American streaming platform, there are times where you’ll just see the brand names blurred out.
