AskReddit,fq0e4j6,t3_gge8dn,1589030572.0,"This brought back a lot of feelings... My sophomore year of high school, I met this boy who also has red hair. I thought he was pretty cool, and his mom gave me a ride home one time after school. He had some problems with his back, and he had to wear a huge brace. He didn't have it on when I first met him, and I think I asked him what was wrong, but of course I don't remember. He didn't have a backpack, instead, wheeled around this briefcase thing. I never really developed a crush on him, but I did look forward to seeing him, and sometimes I'd wait for him in the hallway where I'd seen him before to say hello to him. (He had a very contagious smile). But often times he wasn't there. I don't know if maybe he just took a different way to glass those few days I did see him, or if he wasn't at school those days. 

Anyway, my junior year my family moved to a different state halfway through the year, and I started the second half of my semester there. I really didn't have many friends at my old school, but I said bye to everyone I knew there, I think. Well, I didn't really keep up with anybody because I didn't feel the need to, and I found out that the redheaded kid killed himself because my sister in law told me. She said, ""Do you know *his name*?"" And I said, ""Oh yeah, I remember him!"" And that was it. His life was over. It hit me really hard because I know what it was like to be suicidal. I never knew him very well, but I wish I would have."

Well, my feet were at the end where the boards were, and I felt something grab my ankle firmly. I yelped and pulled my foot away. 

Now, my first thought was that one of my sister's was playing a prank on me, because we shared a room (the 3 of us) and my sister, the night before, was hiding in my stuffed animals to scare me. 

However, I yelled her name, and she responded from her bed. I said my other sister's name, and she sleepily grunted from her bed, so I knew it was neither of them. I spoke to them about it the next morning and they knew nothing about any of it."

Periods,fptl4l7,t1_fptjusc,1588893291.0,"Okay! It makes sense that you're asking then. There's a lot of new stuff she's going to go through. Her periods won't be regular for a while, and it could even be up to 2 years or longer after her first period that they will be that way. ""Normal"" is a period once a month, but that's not always the case. A cycle is from the start of the period till the start of the next one. The average cycle is anywhere between 26 and 38 days I believe, although there can be other ranges, but that might be something you would talk to a doctor if they are irregular going into adulthood. 
Ovulation usually occurs on the 14th day, but I've never had regular ovulation, and sometimes I ovulated twice a month. I used to wear panty liners because I hated the wet feeling all the time, and if she wants to, occasionally is fine, but not every day. You want to be able to breath down there. 

So, before the period itself, during, and sometimes after, she's probably going to have cramping in any of these areas: stomach (lower stomach, around where the uterus is), lower back) arms and legs, inner thighs, butt, and vagina cramping as well (which really sucks). All these places are normal (and I honestly could be missing some), but excessive pain should be brought to a doctor. Like if she can't move, or is bedridden, definitely go to a doctor. 

She's going to be more emotional, but that doesn't mean that everything she's feeling on her period is wrong, she's likely going to just feel everything more. It's different for everybody, really. If she doesn't know why she's crying, just bring her some tea and a warm bag of rice or something. (To put on the cramping area, it helps). Ibuprofen and magnesium helps with light cramping, but girls use all sorts of different things for heavy cramping, usually doctor recommended. 

I apologise for the book, but just trying to get as many details out there as possible! Thanks for being a proactive dad! It's tough being a teen, and taking care of one too."
