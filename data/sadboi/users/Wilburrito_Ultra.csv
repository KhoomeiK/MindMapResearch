stevenuniverse,fnqpak3,t3_g3c0zq,1587169262.0,"The ""girls mature first"" mentality is dangerous, leading men to think it's okay to get with young girls since they ""mature faster."" It echos the whole thing where older guys tell girls that they're more mature than their age is to groom them.

I would like to see sources on this information. Puberty doesn't magically make anyone more mature and intelligent. Mental and physical maturity are two different things. The only thing that may even remotely make a girl appear (and I use appear because girls who hit puberty are not magically mature at that point) more mature is the difference in upbringing. Due to sexism and the like, girls are raised to be more submissive, quieter, more polite. 

Had better handled the PTSD? No amount of intelligence or maturity gives you an edge over such a mental illness. Both of my sisters, ones you've stated that are ""mature"" by your standards, suffer from PTSD and they are tormented by it. You think being able to read well and do high end mathematics can stop the night terrors? The panic attacks? The constant feeling something is watching you? The hyper-vigilance? The constant pain that your body feels since the brain is constantly overreacting to any little threat by dumping adrenaline into your bloodstream?

I too have PTSD. I know no amount of gender or maturity can stop it.

What even is intelligence anyway? How could it be affected by puberty? This would insinuate that the brains of girls and boys are naturally different, which has already been debunked by science for a while now.

This too falls into the age old argument of nature versus nurture. What makes a person who they are? Is it all in their genetics? Or is it all in how one is raised? The scientific community generally believes both are factors. 

There would've been very little difference between Nora and Steven genetically, since they both would've had the same parents. Therefore, your argument hinges solely on the notion of girls and boys having a different kind of brain due to having different hormones. Once again, brain difference between boys and girls have been disproved.

Let's take a look at the nurture aspect. Both Nora and Steven, being raised mostly by the gems, would've had the same upbringing, even more so than if they had been raised by human parents. Why? Because the gems have no concept of human gender. Whether or not gems have their own genders is another discussion unto itself, butÂ  the likelihood of having genders completely equivalent to humans is impossible. Therefore, they would've treated Nora and Steven equally, especially since they weren't raised with the same concept of gender roles that humans are raised with.

If we look at the Crystal Gems' parenting, we can see they have some fundamental issues in their approach. Early episodes show them leaving Steven alone for good chunks of time. Steven spends time with his father at times, yes, but it's also shown that Steve spends most of his time alone while the Crystal Gems are out. We get this information from the episode wherein Steven meets Onion's friends. At the end of the episode, we learn that Steven was invited along because Onion noticed how alone Steven usually is. This would imply that Steven does not spend a lot of his alone time with his father.

Gems have no concept of age, either. That makes them, by default, even more likely to make mistakes in their parenting.

Steven is immature at the beginning of the show because, even though he has loving guardians, he is not given the amount of attention he needs to help him grow. He doesn't go to school, so he doesn't see how his peers behave. He doesn't have a way to have more life experiences with kids his age. This lack of experience is what makes him who he is. It's when he starts to go on missions that he begins to grow.

Let's bring this full circle. Nora would've been raised practically the same way Steven has. Considering that nurture has a large effect on one's future personality, we can extrapolate that Nora and Steven would've matured mentally at the same time and would've acted similarly. One would not have an edge over the other, since their equivalent upbringings would give them near equivalent mental maturity levels.

PTSD is also a complex mental illness that is handled differently by different people. Pinning it all on gender is obtuse. PTSD makes some people more aggressive, while others become withdrawn and develop avoidance behaviours. Nora and Steven, having the same experiences, would've probably had similar, or the same, reactions to the PTSD, giving neither of them an edge over the other.

The two would behave similarly. Nora would not have been any more help with the others' character development just because she was a girl. 

It's an interesting theory to consider if Steven had been Nora, but Nora certainly wouldn't have been more mature."

1. I rarely see the Phlogistinator in pubs as it already is. I see the occasional Pyro with a Medic harassing people, but even that is rare. I think the playstyle is much too boring for most people to stick with for long. Sure, it's occasionally fun to run in a torch people, but in the end, most people return to Pyro for either the intense combo playstyle or the more supportive Pybro style. I think it's rarity of use and it's removal of one of Pyro's best and most fun features is enough punishment for the weapon and its user.

Also, in my experience, a Heavy can easily combat such a Pyro since the Pyro can't bounce the Heavy around and inhibit aim or movement. Soldiers and Demomen can also easily kill a Phlog Pyro.

People panic sometimes when they see an enemy gunning right for them out of nowhere. If you keep a level head and focus the Pyro when they taunt, you can easily wall them in unless they actually strategize by ambushing.

2. I agree in that the Scorch Shot needs no change. I don't even think a distance nerf is needed. It's a great support weapon for taking out stickies and annoying other players to keep focus off your other teammates. Good for knocking Snipers off balance too.

3. The Neon Annihilater is such a niche weapon and comes into play so rarely, that I don't think it needs a debuff.

Buffs:

1. The Dragon's Fury is fun until you try to airblast. I agree it needs a looking at. Maybe lessening the down time on airblast?

2. Agree on both but I'm personally not sure how they'd be rebalanced.

3. Kind of on the fence about the Volcano Fragment. Like, sure, every weapon should be given its time to shine, but what can you do with such a weapon? It's just so bad. Also on the fence about the Axtinguisher as well.

Or, like you said, he could've ended up with a ton of indentured servants. It makes sense! He probably brought in all his rich buddies and their money. They ain't gonna work. Why not rig the system so there are indentured servants to do the work?

Economics-wise, there's obviously currency, shops, vending machines, etc. Clearly a capitalist system, but it's completely unregulated. In the second game, Sinclair made his money off of taking advantage of the poor. He knew they couldn't afford to live anywhere else, so he charged the people that lived in his slums just the right amount to where they wouldn't die, he'd get everything he could out of them, and they could never afford to go anywhere else. Capitalism right there.

I don't think I need to bring up proof of there being no regulation, since Ryan states that as his philosophy as obnoxiously as possible several times in the first game.

The second game ends up being pretty important. It shows that there were places with severely impoverished people, showing that Ryan's unregulated capitalism was a bad idea. It was supposedly a place of freedom, where one could go to avoid the censor and pursue whatever they wanted, but it certainly didn't turn out that way for the poor. Most freedom they got was to starve and live in slums. And it was legal to do that to them because there was no regulation!

Imagine how hellish that must have been. No social services. That's even worse than what the United States has right now. 

Rapture had an entire class of poor people that could do nothing but work constantly long hours to survive. Great source of cheap labor, huh? And those laborers are never going to move to greener pastures because they'll never afford it.

That explains the maintenance costs and how the place was sustained. Pay your workers just barely enough to survive, and they can't go anywhere else. They get to do all the work while the rich folks get to futz around and do whatever they want. 

Ryan does end up giving up a bit of his philosophy in the end. If I'm remembering correctly, he tries to shut down Fontaine's business because it begins to threaten his own power. Just the fact he thought unregulated capitalism was a good idea in the first place shows he's 1) stupid, 2) has no regard for human life, and 3) is only interested in his own well-being.

Ryan doesn't despise the government. He just despises any government that he doesn't run and any government where he doesn't have complete power.

He saw opportunity and grabbed it. He made himself the perfect little city where he's on top, and wrapped it all up in a disguise of being a place of complete ""freedom."" I don't think he's a hypocrite, nor do I think the concept of Rapture is poorly planned.

I may have wandered off topic a bit, but I hope this all makes sense."

If it makes you feel any better, public pool drains have stringent requirements now to guarantee that they are safe and can't stick you to the ground underwater. 

Pool drains used to be dangerous because they were usually just holes in the ground with a small plastic grate to let water through. Since these drains were flat, you could get stuck to one. It's like when you turn on a vacuum, pull off the hose bit, and stick your hand on the end. It seals your hand to the hose until you pull it off. The pool pump is much stronger than a vacuum hose though, so if you got stuck on one of those old drains, then you'd be in trouble to say the least. You would be sealed to the bottom of the pool.

If you can't get sealed to the drain, then it's safe! My pool has a drain resembling a hockey puck. The holes are on the side of the hockey puck shape instead of flat on the ground, so it would be impossible for me to make a perfect seal. Those big square drains that curve up are also safe. If the drain is flat but very large to where a person couldn't cover it entirely, then that is safe as well. The drains pictured above appear to curve, also preventing a perfect seal. They are doubly safe too since there is two of them. If someone did somehow manage to cover up one of them entirely, the suction would just switch over to the other drain since they are on the same line. There are other kinds of drains as well. Generally, if the drain is only a small hole in the ground with a flat, plastic grate, then it isn't safe. Don't go near it. 

You can run the pool pump safely if you have the safe drain covers, even though it still isn't recommended. 

The safe drains are, well, safe though. I still stay away from them anyways because they look scary to me. I've always been afraid of pool drains for whatever reason. At least I know which ones are dangerous and which aren't though. For whatever reason, I'm more scared of the hockey puck looking drains over the big square curved ones.

I hope this helped a little!"
submechanophobia,fgllls8,t1_fddsqh8,1580903430.0,"Late reply, my bad.

The drain is on if the pool pump is on. Generally, the pump isn't supposed to be on while the pool is in use, but lots of people don't know the dangers (especially people that own their own pool) of leaving it on. So the drain could be on at any time if the pool pump is actively on and circulating water.

To clarify, my father basically told me the drain didn't do anything except, well, drain the pool. Thus the insinuation was that if the pool wasn't being drained, then the drain is not active, which is false."

Before a few days ago, I thought that drains were harmless. My father actually used to tell me that they were never on unless the pool was being drained. As a result, a few days ago, I found out that my father is a dumbass that makes things up on the fly (which I already knew I guess, this just hammered it home). The drain is part of the circulation system and can stick you to the bottom of the pool if you manage to cover the entire drain and form a perfect seal.

A child was seriously injured by a pool drain which led to laws being passed in the United States that regulate how the drains are to be constructed and covered. Thank goodness!"

submechanophobia,fbwpdy0,t1_fbs1skb,1577155909.0,"Luckily the drains in the picture appear to be the safe two drain version. If one gets blocked, all the suction goes to the other drain so the one you're stuck on will just let you go. There's one pipe with two different drains attached.

The drains also seem to have special drain covers to keep the entrance from being completely blocked, preventing someone from forming a perfect seal.

A small, single, flat drain with no cover and just a grate or a plastic grate is the most dangerous. Stay away from them. If the drain can make a perfect seal, then it's dangerous.

Yeah, I learned a lot about pool drains. They scare the crap out of me and I hate them."

DataHoarder,fa9x4he,t3_e5zuxw,1575895373.0,"I was diagnosed with OCD back in 2012 or so. It seems to somehow run in my family on my mother's side. My grandmother is a hoarder. Hoarding itself seems to have a link to OCD if I'm remembering the articles I have read correctly.

To me, hoarding data is a lot less destructive than hoarding physical items. It's easier on your house, on family, and possibly on your bank account. So, even if it is an offshoot of your OCD, so what? You enjoy it, it's not as destructive as it could be, and it's letting you have a safer way of hoarding things. I've always said to my friends that hoarding data is a lot better for me, because otherwise I'd probably start physically hoarding stuff and that would be harder on me and the places I live in.

Who gives a damn if it's the result of mental illness? It doesn't matter as long as you're not hurting someone or yourself. As long as the hobby remains beneficial to you and you do not find it to be harming you, then it doesn't really matter why you do the things that you do.


Also, saying a hobby is worthless because it's a waste of money is a really crappy way to look at hobbies. Hobbies are there to be enjoyed. They aren't something that has to be profitable. The rewards to be reaped are enjoyment, satisfaction, and personal fulfillment. In a world where there is constant increasing pressure to monetize everything you do, this can be very hard to remember.

And finally, of course, if that data is important enough to you that you bothered to save it, then it is irrelevant if it is important to anyone else. The value we place on things is usually quite subjective after all.

Anyways, this is what I would tell myself and others if I was questioned about my hobby. Maybe try to shorten it to a 1 minute speech though."

If you live in the United States, minors rights are lacking. I recommend not putting anything on the sheets and instead talking to the doctor while alone in the room with them about the issues. Note: If you mention being actively suicidal (having a plan on how you will kill yourself and when), your parents will be alerted. They will also be alerted if you say you plan to harm yourself or another person. You will be hospitalized for both reasons.

For the eating disorder stuff, try eating very small snacks and meals several times throughout the day. Maybe having something lighter on your stomach will help your mind take it easy. Do not weigh yourself. It might be tempting, but do not do it. At the doctor's, allow them to weigh you but demand that they do not mention the number and stand on the scale backwards as to not see the numbers. If you've got a scale in your house and you're eyeing it, immediately go off and find something to distract yourself.

I'm not sure how severe your disordered eating is, or how far along it has progressed, but you should try to start fighting it now. Every time you resist the urge to throw up, your resolve gets a little stronger. Every time you eat a meal, not only are you nourishing your body and keeping it strong, but the compulsion not eat gets a little weaker.

I recommend finding something to do to distract yourself after eating to help keep the anxiety and compulsion to vomit at bay. Can you play video games? Could you write or draw? Could you take a walk, which directly interferes with your ability to induce vomiting? 

I am not a doctor, so make sure to do your own research and, if possible, consult a professional. I have disordered eating to a degree, and I find it startlingly similar to my OCD compulsions. Perhaps researching resisting compulsions can help. I also recommend researching Bulimia and Anorexia to become familiar with your struggles and condition. Knowledge is power. Sometimes, understanding something makes it a little less scary. You don't have to have a diagnosis in order to do research. If your symptoms line up, make an assumption and look for ways that you can help with what you're struggling with. 

Absolutely check out the blog ""bigfatscience"" on Tumblr. It has helped me maintain a positive body image throughout the years. Well, at least, a neutral one.

Try and be careful about what information you share with your mother. Ask yourself, ""Could this be used against me?"" before sharing. This may be hard to do. People like your mother will take your information and find ways to exploit it to control you more. Making hurtful comments about weight isn't just about the hurt factor; it's also about the fact that she can make a well aimed comment that will cause you to act in a manner that she wants.

Waiting is also not a hopeless endeavor. You will one day be allowed to leave your mother and go out into the world to build yourself up and to create a new life for yourself. It's a matter of surviving until that time comes.

If at some point you are at your absolute worst, contact a suicide helpline. If you are on the verge of killing yourself, calling 911 or your country's emergency number and telling them you are planning on killing yourself, which will likely have them come and hospitalize you. Being in a mental ward is a hit or miss kind of thing. They will try to find the right medicine and right forms of treatment very, very quickly. What's most important is that they will prevent you from ending your life.
