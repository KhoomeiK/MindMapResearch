tdlr;; u not missing anything but if you really want to lucid dream, experience extreme emotion (like stress), have something big happen/impact you, or have something playing in the background if you want to **possibly** trigger a lucid dream.

but other's are really awful nightmares that feel so real that when i wake up, i think that the dream was something that actually happened.
