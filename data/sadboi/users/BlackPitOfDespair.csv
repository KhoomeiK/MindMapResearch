Once he did his parents soon found themselves outcast by other parents in the school ( their community is pretty conservative). Those other parents didn’t want them to be loving and supportive. They also got shunned at their church, so they dropped out.

Then later their son came out as trans. So now there are former friends who give my friends a hard time about parenting etc. his boss who is also very conservative also disapproved. 

So allies can also pay a price. So we should do something supportive for them."

Poor and POC are invisible. This invalidates the experiences of anyone not in that category. So they tend not to come out. See the concept of “intersectionality”. 

Also I’ve found that only the most butch ones are acceptable. The macho man or butch lesbian who is “one of the guys”. It all goes back to misogyny. The Feminine is seen as weak. 

It’s also about the work. I’ve worked everything from forestry to factory to IT. It is easier to get to know people in the “talky” jobs. You tend to be split apart in some jobs so you don’t get to know people. Though in my last factory job there was one guy out and proud.

The point being that we all knew each other and felt comfortable first. I think you might have that in your situation. The fact it might be his first time might make it a bit tougher.
