domesticviolence,fqhvpbf,t3_gixyvt,1589385420.0,Realizing that the only thing he wants is control will help. Set yourself free babes. Stay safe.

NarcissisticAbuse,fqgk3cv,t1_fqgju81,1589348394.0,My hero. ❤️ thank you😂😩
raisedbynarcissists,fqgjxt2,t3_gik6yo,1589348274.0,"Same to everything you said my ndad would treat me like an outcast, criticize, abuse me and then come home with a new gift but then act like he was doing me a favor. Idk.😂"
relationship_advice,fqgjkaw,t3_gimio6,1589347980.0,This is so adorable  I have no advice for you because I do this too. Sry😂😂😂
NarcissisticAbuse,fqfif45,t1_fqfi4yy,1589325455.0,I’m doing it no excuses tonight thank you I realized this and I need to keep reminding myself
NarcissisticAbuse,fqfbmnb,t1_fqf6fm5,1589322034.0,Thank you that’s the push I needed. much love ❤️❤️❤️
BPD,fqdip10,t3_gi3isg,1589290522.0,"I’m the same way, it’s helpful to think that if you see yourself how you see that other person stop putting them on a pedestal. Idk I’m also still insecure and jealous but this helps me soothe the feelings. Idk."
therapy,fq8wy8l,t3_ghdd5u,1589177986.0,I feel like it’s genuinely so beautiful you’re attached to your therapist. it can be really hard finding a good one. If you ever feel like things are crossing boundaries you should definitely voice that too though but it sounds like you don’t feel like that so keep doing you girl much love. ❤️
raisedbynarcissists,fq6uzwi,t1_fq6rukg,1589138191.0,Thank you for sharing that opened up a new perspective for me.
relationship_advice,fq52duo,t1_fq52706,1589090385.0,I will tell him this I’m at my breaking point I’m ready to go and when I am then he’ll start crying saying he doesn’t want to lose me and then I feel powerless and guilty.  It’s insanely confusing.
relationship_advice,fq51vru,t1_fq51p3h,1589089956.0,I hear you. I’ve tried this so many times. And that’s when he’ll start promising he’ll change and never does. I start questioning if I just have high standards.
narcissisticparents,fq4tuf1,t3_ggmuuj,1589084037.0,Ik this isn’t about my parents but I feel this because my boyfriend does this to me too he’ll tell me I shouldn’t spend my money on things and that the things I spend my money on are so stupid. Sounds like your mom needs some help out of this situation and it only gets worse and I highly doubt that’s the only aspect he controls have you tried talking to her? how does she feel?
NarcissisticAbuse,fq4nwno,t3_ggtncp,1589080171.0,Ooooof same 90% nice.
NarcissisticAbuse,fpvcjuj,t3_gfq8ri,1588941608.0,Narcs cannot reflect deep you can. and this typically happens when you’re gaslighted so much that you doubt your own reality and believe his words over yours. You may have narc tendencies and you may not I would look into it and look up YouTube videos about thinking your the narc etc.   I know that helped me a ton. Not a replacement for therapy but if you feel extremely helpless that might help. Much love ❤️❤️❤️and thank you for posting this because I did this as well and I felt really embarrassed and ashamed and still did up until this post❤️
relationship_advice,fppp9gd,t1_fppoycx,1588806518.0,"Im currently keeping in the back of my mind I need to get out, he ignores me when we’re together but then gets angry and guilt trips me when I want to take alone time, and thank you for validating that it is emotionally damaging because it fucking is."
relationship_advice,fppo3w8,t1_fppnguq,1588805895.0,I feel hopeless because when I bring this up to him he seems surprised every time but this is the somewhere around the 4 or 5 convo... at this point when I’m consistently ignored i just shutdown..  but then when he wants to talk he expects me to be there and act like he wasn’t just ignoring me for 10 min while I’m talking to myself..
abusiverelationships,fpnqafu,t1_fpn2o8k,1588770198.0,This is so relatable I tend to just act like my problem was never a problem in the first place. That’s how I feel with so many people I’ve been communicating with while I’ve been in this relationship also
BPD,fpnocld,t3_ge6pgr,1588768845.0,This hit home
abusiverelationships,fpkdckg,t1_fpkd4m1,1588692617.0,Nope I wish but I have a non existent relationship with both parents both are narcissistic and I’m trying to not be around toxic people if I’m already leaving a toxic situation I feel Stuck forsure
abusiverelationships,fpkc4kz,t1_fpkbzly,1588691974.0,No it doesn’t sound bad because it’s the truth and thank you for that. I know he doesn’t I feel it I’m just being stupid and not leaving because I can’t find an apartment.
relationship_advice,fpijcz4,t3_gdiewe,1588642118.0,"I’m only being honest because I really wish someone would’ve been with me. Get out. It’s going to get worse and you’re going to lose yourself and rationalize his abuse and feel even more alone then ever.. if he can’t understand that people make mistakes that they cannot control than he is the problem! I can’t even put into words the psychological and physical abuse my current bf put me through. We’ve been together for years and I’m just now realizing healthy relationships aren’t supposed to make you feel like shit!!!
Stay strong it can be really hard to come to the realization they really don’t care but once you do you stop putting ALL of your energy and care into them and put it into yourself ❤️❤️"

raisedbynarcissists,fpgdith,t3_gczl2o,1588600455.0,I feel you I went through this exact thing and I still am my grandma is an enabler and so is my mom after I tell them I try not to have contact with my ndad they say you shouldn’t do that “HES YOUR DAD” even though that means nothing. You are entitled an opinion and if someone can’t respect that you put up boundaries it’s not your fault.. it’s there’s. Stay strong I know it’s hard and it feels like gaslighting but keep validating yourself you know what you went through.. no one else..
AvPD,fpd1sb2,t1_fpc67vs,1588517997.0,Thank you!!! I know this helped me because I’m constantly worried about what others are thinking even I know it’s pointless...

BPD,fparuue,t1_fpaq2ne,1588454405.0,I’m sorry I totally understand I would be better off just looking at myself and what I can work on. Thank you.
BPD,fpapmcj,t1_fpapcc7,1588453077.0,I hope I’m not being an asshole too I’m constantly trying to work things out and figure out why everything is so hostile I just want to be happy with him... I may be subconsciously being an asshole because I also don’t forgive him for physical abuse that happened. But i have no idea..

relationship_advice,fow8t4v,t1_fow7pf0,1588115138.0,😂😂 lol. I tell him I’m not trying to hurt him I just want to be transparent and talk about issues so we can fix them and he just says “I promise I’ll change” and at this point I know he won’t...
relationship_advice,fow751s,t1_fow6z2w,1588114253.0,He gets defensive as hell it feels impossible to even talk to him.
relationship_advice,fow6zy0,t1_fow6rjh,1588114178.0,Amen to that I’m so ready to leave!!
relationship_advice,fow6ipc,t1_fow66mj,1588113925.0,That is what I’ve been doing tbh I’ve let the dishes go for a couple days im not cleaning up after his messes as much but he also has guests over all the time... but he doesn’t even care enough to notice when people come over he’ll just apologize and say “sorry it’s a mess in here” right after I got done cleaning.
relationship_advice,fow62mx,t1_fow5x0l,1588113689.0,I like that idea I’ll try this. Thank you!
