What amount of knowledge is “dick” exactly? I have an analytical mind but no expertise in the subject matter, I just did 15 minutes of research online before I posted that. I had also done a couple hours of research on this last year because I had MRSA and wanted to understand how that could or could not spread in pools. Still doesn’t mean I know whatever “dick” amount seems good enough for you. But I’m not an idiot. And I’m not claiming to be an expert. 

If you have contradicting information, we would all love to hear it. We are all here to understand this thing. So maybe try to be useful instead of being hostile.

konmari,fctt5o8,t3_eb8qyh,1577958185.0,"I’m Turkish. We moved to the US when I was 10. I’ve been talking to my mom about decluttering for years, and now adding some Konmari specific elements as well. From my experience decluttering with my mom over the years, and my general experience with my extended family (all Turkish) in the US and in Turkey, I have some input that you might find useful as you talk to her about Konmari —

1) Most Turkish people, due to many aspects of the culture, will use their things carefully, repurpose or fix things, and in general use their resources frugally relative to Americans. This is all the more true for the 45+y/o Turks due to the more internationally isolated and economically limited culture they were raised in. The western (and specifically American) influence in Turkey blew up in the 2000s. My generation (I’m 28) in Turkey behaves more like an American with their belongings and resources. 

2) The first point also means that people are hesitant to let go of their things due to possible economic hardship. That’s the generation of people whose parents (my grandparents) moved from the rural villages to the cities without any education or “city manners” and worked hard and saved up and paid for their condos with cash. There were no mortgages then - this is a relatively new thing in Turkey. Imagine the norm being people buying their home with cash! And specifically people that didn’t even finish elementary school and built their own homes in their villages with rocks and mud for walls and tree branches for the roof and the bare earth for the floor. That was the kind of home my dad was born in. Now those grandparents own a classy condo in a well off neighborhood. So these people have a MUCH higher tolerance for keeping stuff around just in case they can use it. The inventory doesn’t bother them. It’s their joy to be able to save money. 

3) Turkish women are very tidy relative to Americans. And VERY clean. The kind of thorough cleaning the average Turkish mother does is more than what a paid cleaning crew normally does in the US. Being tidy and clean is a huge huge huge part of the Turkish woman’s identity. There is shame for women in failing at the high standards of housekeeping. And this is an honor/shame culture. Turkish women are not minimalists, and they are not obsessed with the Pinterest porn of what “well organized” looks like in the US (which is more about styling and decorating a nice living space through organization than it is about housekeeping). But, they are definitely serious about being tidy for the sake of good housekeeping. Their home is a display of their femininity and grace, and they take great pride in it. 

4) The most important parts of the home are spaces that guests use. So for the common home layout - the most important space is the formal living room (which tends to include the formal dining area), second is the bathroom or potentially the balcony if it’s nice weather, third is the kitchen, fourth is the guest bedroom if there is one. The family bedrooms and the family sitting room are of the lowest priority since guests aren’t usually there. And the family sitting room takes priority over the bedrooms. Community and hospitality are the drivers of housekeeping."
explainlikeimfive,f9n7jr6,t1_f9mk2eu,1575478689.0,"I appreciate that. 

What I literally said was that the ‘public mob’ decides what’s acceptable by the ‘public’. That was my attempt at summarizing how a group of outraged people (mob) suddenly forms to swiftly and definitively condemn something and it becomes “the public consensus” without the input of most of the public. The ‘public mob’ is strong enough to get something cancelled even if the public as a whole may have been largely okay with continuing to consume that person’s work. 

Is that crazy? Is that a totally stupid opinion? Did I do a complete shit job summarizing that into a single statement? I don’t get where the rejection is coming from. 



*** Tangent

I love Reddit so much for the wholesome real talk, collaboration, acceptance, and encouragement on here and somehow I almost always get backlash to the things I say.

I literally took 30 minutes to write that post because I wanted to wordsmith my post and make sure it’s sufficiently in line with how the term is discussed elsewhere so that I didn’t leave room for someone to turn the conversation towards shaming some piece of what I’ve said instead of continuing a conversation of mutual respect. 

For example, (and this is a **very mild** example) in this case the person could’ve just said “Can you elaborate on what you meant by this? I read it this way and I’d strongly disagree with that.” Or, “I generally agree with this persons definition but this particular piece doesn’t sound right to me. Here’s what I think instead.”  That’s how I see people respond most of the time in the posts I read. And I tend to get responses more along the lines of “how dare you say” or “if you make dumbass comments like that, god save anyone who knows you”.  This particular person’s response was much more polite, which I appreciate. But still communicates “I would shame you for this statement but I’m gonna give you a chance to take it back.”

It’s not at all the same thing as the public mob / cancel culture, so please don’t get angry thinking I’m making that claim. But I see similarities in how my contribution to the post’s discussion as a whole gets squashed because of one or two people’s rejection of some part of what I said."
explainlikeimfive,f9m6msg,t3_e5v54e,1575443706.0,"It specifically stems from the phenomenon of shows, movies, performances being cancelled due to a public figure’s “sins” (in the public eye, not in the religious sense). An early example of cancel culture: House of Cards got a death sentence shortly after allegations against Kevin Spacey became public.

Cancel culture has become a broader term for the public mob acting as the authority on judging who’s worthy of being accepted by the public and excommunicating the unworthy.

But to this day, I am regularly in situations where I have to go to war within myself to be able to do something.

I fully believe that one day I’ll get to a place where I’m no longer afraid and no longer need to fight the negative thoughts in my head.

I have been surprised to find out that the path to learning to not be afraid was learning to fight - and fight enough to have a LOT of evidence that I am perfectly capable of survival. That’s what gives me the sense of safety and confidence to no longer be afraid.

I am SO happy for you that you won this battle. I promise it will get easier. Keep fighting for yourself. One day you will face risk and vulnerability with gratitude because it’ll remind you of your freedom from fear. You’ll know that you are freely making a choice and you are at peace with your choice regardless of the outcomes. That feels like a high unlike anything else in life. I cant imagine any passionate love or any drug or any success that could be more fulfilling than fighting for yourself and gaining security and peace. 

Thank you for giving my heart the encouragement of witnessing your victory today. Not only am I happy for you, but also your victory reminded me to be grateful for my own journey and be patient and believe in myself. It’s easy to forget, and it’s hard to remind myself.

beermoney,f7zaaib,t3_d8qc1a,1574107747.0,I signed up 3 weeks ago and an overwhelming majority of the studies I’m seeing are not related to me based on job or lifestyle (single no kids). I rarely see general opinion ones. Anyone have any ideas on how this works ?
beermoney,f7z9ml4,t3_cs5z74,1574107459.0,"I agree that the study titles / descriptions make it difficult to get use from the site. 

I joined Respondent about 3 weeks ago and try to apply for projects every day. There are ~90 projects that are available for me to browse through on a given day but there are *barely* 3 I can apply for each day. I’ve only been asked to participate in one thing so far. It was $125 for 60 minutes. 

There are rarely things in my browsing list that are relevant to me. Most surveys are for small business owners, business execs, people who make company-wide purchasing decisions (like supplies or hardware or ongoing education resources or benefits vendors), parents, homeowners, software engineers, finance professionals or bank managers. 

I am just an almost-30-year-old who has been working as an IT analyst, rents an apartment, never married, no kids. Once in a blue moon I’ll see a widely applicable consumer research study - like my use of home cleaning supplies - and I’ll apply to those. Once in a blue moon I’ll see a study that seems vague and perhaps might be relevant so I start the questionnaire and will get kicked out of the questionnaire before the end - I assume because my answer to a particular question eliminated me from eligibility - and I’ll lose 1 of my application allowances for that day. 

An overwhelming majority of projects are things I’ve already seen. There’s no way to remove them from my browsing list if I don’t think it’s relevant. There are usually a couple of studies that are clearly expired - the title itself says the study is on a specific date and that date has passed. All in all, I only see a handful of new things each day and they’re rarely relevant to me. 

I joined Respondent because I worked somewhere that did consumer research through Respondent participants, so a bunch of people on the team signed up as participants themselves to check it out and they made $600-800 in one month. I’m not having that kind of luck."
JungianTypology,f7l9u85,t3_dwi54d,1573835859.0,"Any quiz is someone’s attempt at trying to figure out how you are, and open to miscommunication like any conversation you might have with a total stranger. Use quizzes only as a starting point / for fun. If you’re interested in getting more accurate results and specific explanations, you’ll need to understand the concepts yourself and use your own judgement. Sometimes I question someone myself if I want to type them. Sometimes I ask them to take a quiz and then I use my own questions to validate the quiz results or find a more accurate type based on how their answers to me deviate from the results the quiz gave them. 

I think 16personalities is a good starting point for total beginners who don’t want to get nerdy about it. It’s easy to digest because it’s as generalized as it can get while still understanding the concepts accurately. 

Personality Hacker is a good step for people who want to dive into being nerdy. They have a quiz but more importantly, they are right on the money with their analyses and explanations of the types. They explain the cognitive functions and how they present themselves differently depending on the position. It’s an entry to analytical psychology. Once you understand how the cognitive functions work, you’ll be able to use your own judgement to type people which, as you grow your understanding, will give you more accurate results than any online quiz. This is because you can change your approach and phrasing and add effective analogies depending on your sense of whether or not the person you’re typing is understanding your questions. Se people are less introspective or self aware than others, so you may need to guide the person through the thought process in order for them to answer your questions accurately. How people think they are and how they really are can be different sometimes. Knowing how to guide people through all of these things is the key to finding the most accurate type. 

Some quiz created to type the general population is not going to be able to get you excitingly accurate results. 

One more thing. A type can look very different on different cultures, family dynamics, etc. A person with certain kinds of trauma in their childhood and adolescence may be more turbulent than the average person. They may lean heavily on their strongest cognitive functions and leave their other functions less developed. They will present a very different personality than the average person. But the order of their cognitive functions will still be the same and the model can still be used to explain the behaviors of that person. 

All in all, the best resource is your own judgement because you can turn typing into a very personalized experience and therefore get more accurate and interesting results. 

The personality model is only as good as it helps you make sense of reality. Make sure you’re not trying to make reality fit the model."
