casualiama,f80hn2a,t1_f7ya1rp,1574129262.0,"I am really struck by the amount of hate you have for this person, when you KNEW HE WAS BEING ABUSED. You say it like it‚Äôs an afterthought, but it‚Äôs a privilege that you don‚Äôt understand how much this was likely a huge driving factor for this person‚Äôs behavior. Was he creepy to you? Yes. Do you need to talk about him hatefully, knowing he was LIVING in constant abuse, or could you try to have some compassion for him? They say hate can‚Äôt drive hate out; only love can do that. The only way we can fix this is by having compassion for people who are in so much pain that they think this is a viable alternative. Get outside your own head."
