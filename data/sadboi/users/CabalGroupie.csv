But with open communication and a sense of empathy I've never had in any previous relationship, this is by far the happiest and healthest I've been while in a relationship. We're currently long distance in different counties but am currently planning on proposing later this year when I can see her once covid-19 travel restrictions are lifted."

I've been just actively trying to hold back and let them start the conversations unless I have something pertinent to say. And when I obsess about them I allow myself to have my fantasy but ground myself as to why our relationship won't work.

I know my situation is very specific but hopefully it helps ðŸ˜Š"

 Now we're separated with the hope that distance could let us work on our own stuff separately and refigure things out in a few months. Unfortunately, my brain starting 'splitting' to try and cope and now I barely Remeber the last 3 years and my feelings for her just shut off.

If you need time to calm down then take it. I'd just reccommend keeping him in the loop and communicating with him cause you never really know how your brain is gonna wanna cope from it"
