Psychonaut,ezsfkc5,t1_ezpzpzd,1568089918.0,"This is possibly the most insightful thing I've read on Reddit. (But I have to chuckle about the struggle in trying to understand ""meaning"" vs ""meaninless"". It's hard for me to wrap my brain around a reality that designated some things meaningful and others meaningless. I tend to think it's all meaningful or nothing's meaningful. Haha! Discussion for another time and place, I know;))"
Psychosis,ezsd2w9,t3_d1nboo,1568087613.0,"Thanks for sharing your experience. Your episode has many similarities to mine. It's been really confusing ""returning"" to (consensus) reality. And it's taking a  long time to integrate all of my  experiences. Like you, my concept of reality was thoroughly challenged. I've had 2 years of relative stability and I'm still haunted by the questions that my episode birthed. 

I would recommend continuing to talk about your experience. I've found it really helps in understanding and processing what we can take and learn from it. I would also recommend avoiding further drug experimentation. There is a Very good possibility you will trigger another break. 

I would recommend seeing a psychiatrist if the thoughts that it's left you pondering start to interfere with your understanding of your reality/ daily functioning. Temporary treatment with an antipsychotic can be extremely helpful and a welcomed reprieve from a mind that won't stop trying to figure everything out. 

I wish you all the best. Time and sleep, bare feet on the earth and kind, loving support are great healers. Hang in there. You've had quite a ride;)"
Psychosis,evg2lyg,t3_cjnaus,1564504889.0,"Yes. Honestly, this was the first symptom of my psychotic break and persisted throughout. I would either see ONLY repeating numbers or reversible/reflective numbers. It got so bad that I had to cover my digital clocks with black electrical tape. I totally empathize with how confusing this experience is.  No matter how people justified how this phenomenon could happen, it didn't reduce the amount of stress and confusion it caused. 

So, yeah. It was the first symptom of psychosis and it was the last to dissipate once I started antipsychotics. Hang in there, but I'd keep a close watch on potential obsessive thoughts trying to make obscure connections. It can be a slippery slope...;)"
Psychosis,euw3cwc,t1_euw2vf8,1564069447.0,"Oh- and I wanted to add...Being in psychosis is often times REALLY  embarrassing in retrospect! Once we are stabilizing and recalling what we did and how acted- it can be really humiliating! This might be part of the equation to, which should also decrease in time with the healing process."
Psychosis,euw2vf8,t3_chj8s9,1564069146.0,"I'm really sorry you're going through this. It's true- I've wished that the people around me would have been more understanding and supportive during my psychosis. But, unfortunately, post-psychosis has left me feeling really unsure of many of my previous  friendships because during my episode I had such strange and often terrifying experiences related to those people. When I recall these experiences to my doctor,  he says they were part of the illness. But they seemed real to me and I can't yet completely convince myself that I feel safe around these people yet.  Honestly, I feel like I have a bit of psychosis PTSD regarding them. That has forced me to cut them out of my life while I heal- which takes an indefinite amount of time. 

I don't know if this applies in your situation, but it might and there's a possibility that the most supportive thing you could do for your friend right now is to give them space to heal. I don't know though...hang in there, hold this person sacred and keep yourself open to reconnect in the future:) Best wishes."
Psychosis,etkr90k,t1_etkqzl0,1562905989.0,"Wow, I didn't know you could stop Latuda cold turkey. Hang in there and please keep me posted how your transition goes!"
Psychosis,etkqxfu,t1_etkphgn,1562905697.0,"Oh, ok. Just curious,  is your doctor decreasing your Latuda in increments or just stopping your  80mg?"
Psychosis,etkpcip,t1_etkn9sa,1562904318.0,"The Abilify will probably help. And there's a good chance you might be able to slowly decrease the Latuda if you're on Abilify as well. I would suggest talking to your doc about it. You're not starting Abilify at 10mg though, right? I would think you'd want to start on a lower dose like 2 mg and titrate upwards. But I could be mistaken because I used to be on it for bipolar-maybe the dosages are different to treat different conditions. 

Best of luck on your healing journey:)"
Psychosis,etkmwr5,t3_cc5dl1,1562902298.0,"Sorry that you're experiencing this. It takes time-sometimes a LONG time to heal from an episode, so it's best to try to be patient with the process. When I was on 80mg of Latuda, I experienced all the side effects you mentioned. Fortunately, I was able to work with my psychiatrist and slowly decrease my dose down to one where I can fully function without any psychotic symptoms. 

Honestly, I thought I would never recover from my psychotic break, but it's a year and a half later and I'm doing better than I ever dreamed possible. Hang in there. It gets easier:)"
Psychosis,etc9zzj,t3_cb0imj,1562679618.0,"I was completely convinced people could hear/understand my thoughts for a couple of years. Even though other people told me they couldn't, it felt like they could. I wasn't able to be convinced until I stopped using cbd/thc and went on an antipsychotic. Hang in there. It's a confusing place, but there is a way out:)"
Psychosis,etc9ovx,t3_cax94q,1562679385.0,"I've experienced parallel experiences which have been just as confusing, and remain so in retrospect. Hang in there. Most likely they will subside with the right antipsychotic. They did for me, at least."
bipolar,et37emg,t3_c9rst4,1562429081.0,"Personally, I would keep a close watch on all of your thoughts and behaviors right now. I don't think there's anything wrong with making  associations, but when it starts becoming stressful or 'freaking confusing', I would see that as a red flag to start pumping the brakes on things that could exasperate imbalances. 

In my experience,  making these kind of extreme associations are precursors to more eggagerated and dangerous symptoms. They are accompanied  with an overload of racing thoughts and sleepless nights.  I need to be very careful during this time to not fall into psychosis by doing whatever I can to get good sleep, eat regularly, cut out stimulants/alcohol/mind altering substances,  take long walks- pull out all healthy coping mechanisms from the proverbial tool box. 

I would definitely talk to your doctor about this. It could become a slippery slope and it's best to catch these things early. I hope this doesn't alarm you- I'm only speaking from my experience. Best wishes:)"
Psychosis,es0omy3,t3_c567sx,1561479922.0,"I was treated with Latuda for psychosis. They upped me to 80mg to eliminate symptoms (which made me very spacey, lethargic and numb) but gradually decreased me down to 20mg. I've been stable on this dose for nearly a year where I'm  feeling extremely clear headed, balanced and symptom free. If you choose to decrease, I recommend working closely with your doctor. Best wishes:)"
Psychosis,erj00k7,t1_erhwbn3,1560911814.0,"I completely respect this. Thank you for your response- it was beautifully articulated considering how convoluted and confusing recalling psychosis can be. You’ve put into words a lot of the conclusions I’ve come to as well. I guess I’m still kinda in the phase that you experienced post-psychosis when life outside of the delusions feels pretty pointless-compared to the “alternate reality” heavily laden with the essence of meaning and connection. It’s definitely taking time to heal and fully reconnect to life. It’s very encouraging to me that you’ve seemed to integrate your experience in a objective, healthy way. Thanks:)"
bipolar,erd3omt,t3_c1f3ub,1560729948.0,I experienced severe memory loss on a higher dose.
Psychosis,er4i1kw,t1_er4bzwn,1560492745.0,"Very glad to hear you’re stable and meds are working for you. I find it crazy how similar experiences can be in psychosis. I had parallel convictions and was functioning in psychosis for nearly two years. I’ve been stable and on antipsychotics for over a year, but I can’t seem to shake how real my experience was-especially how convinced I was that I was in some sort of simulation. It sounds like you’ve got to a point where you’re able to recognize the delusional thinking and disregard it as so. I can definitely recognize my delusions in retrospect, but I still wonder if there was a modicum of truth weaved in the madness. Does this make sense? If so, do you ever have the same feelings?"
Psychosis,er46uil,t3_arwvpx,1560482580.0,Hey-I just read your post and could really relate to it. Do you still hold such strong convictions about your experiences? Just curious.
schizoaffective,eqt5f83,t3_bzgycj,1560302680.0,"I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. It sucks that so many of us go through this. I lost nearly all my friends after my last episode and ended up picking up and moving to a new area. It’s kinda like having a new start. It’s taking a while because I’m also introverted, but I’m slowly meeting people and just got a new job that’s a bit social. 

I hope things get better for you. You’re not alone in going through this. It’s a good thing in general that you’re missing social interactions/better than total seclusion-i think that’s a sign you’re moving in a healthy direction. How long ago was your last episode? Sometimes it takes a while to really heal from these things:)"
bipolar,eqpzdui,t1_eqpxxjj,1560208084.0,"It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. In my case, I was able to see a doctor very fast because I had just been hospitalized (but I obviously don’t recommend this). After that they expedited my case and quickly referred me to a psychiatrist. I’m not sure how quick it would be for a new patient. You might be able to call the closest county health clinic and ask some questions.  

In regards to a non-MediCal doctor prescribing medication- do you mean like if you paid out of pocket for an appointment to see a private practice psychiatrist, then tried to get your meds covered by MediCal? I’m not positive, but I don’t think it matters what Dr writes the prescription, your medications should be covered-but I’m not positive. 

It’s worth calling the closest county clinic and explaining that you just got MediCal (or are getting MediCal soon) and that you will need to definitely see a doctor by _______ because will need your medication refill by ________. Hopefully they’ll be able to point you in the right direction. Wishing for the best:)"
Psychosis,eqlfg9e,t3_bysmgd,1560143400.0,"I’m sure a lot of us would love to help you, but if you have serious concerns about your perceptions I would recommend talking to a professional. It never hurts to use your coping mechanisms for anxiety when your feeling anxious, regardless of what is triggering it. Wishing you only the best:)"
bipolar,eqg0q38,t3_bybt5l,1560030048.0,"I moved out of the Bay Area recently and had MediCal for the last year I was there. It helps a lot if you’re already are on meds that are working for you and don’t need to adjust much, so all your dr needs to do is approve refills. County psych units are extremely grim. Visits and meds are usually totally $covered. If SF clinics are way booked out, sometimes you can request to transfer to a sister city. 

Hope this helps and take good care:)"
bipolar,eqamo7g,t1_eqala9y,1559935895.0,?I thought lithium carbonate and lithium orotate are pretty different?
schizoaffective,eq7wkya,t3_bxkwt2,1559854502.0,"I hope that combination works for you. I was taking THC/CBD oil (capsules) 1:1 ratio for around 6 months, plus supplementing with CBD 25:1 for anxiety. I was also recommended to take this by an alternate as treatment (without being on any other psych drugs). This ended in full blown psychosis, two 5150’s, plus an extended hospitalization. And, subsequently, put on psych drugs. 

I’ve been stable for over a year on an antipsychotic and now avoid both CBD and THC not because I don’t think that they Could possible work, but because introducing so many things at such different levels and strains starts to get really confusing to what IS working and what isn’t. (And my antipsychotic is really working). 

Keep us posted of how you’re doing. I really hope this works for you. I do believe cannabis has tons of healing properties- if possible, I hope we can find the combination and strains that can help our disorder. Be safe:)"
bipolar,eq6unrv,t3_bxhhwa,1559835708.0,"I’m totally with you on this. Sorry you’re experiencing this, but I’m tempted to wonder if most of us have this experience with this diagnosis. The meds usually change us, our (often traumatic) experiences usually change us, the social stigma we carry effects the way people view us and the diagnosis itself alters the way we view ourselves. 

I find that I’m A LOT more critical of myself since I’ve been diagnosed (10 years ago). I analyze every action and thought and mood to try to evaluate if it’s balanced or “sane”. I beat myself up if I can’t meet the standards of normalcy most of the time (even if I’m faking it).  I’m always paranoid of people judging me for my diagnosis and I generally experience life being harder now, which definitely prevents me from taking joy in life and laughing as much. 

I guess I would suggest that you try to be easy with yourself. I know that sounds cliche and that it seems difficult to do when we are constantly on    watch for imbalances, but we go through enough as it is. As much as I’ve changed from being the upbeat, bubbly person I was, I’ve gained a huge amount of empathy, patience, understanding, forgiveness, tenderness and tolerance-that might not make me as much fun at parties- but instead gives me genuine qualities that I fundamentally value and respect. 

Hang in there. I wish you only the best. I’m sure you’re still wonderful:)"
schizoaffective,eq2wxy5,t3_bx2yvq,1559745540.0,"In my experience there wasn’t much offered. I have actually been declined by some therapists because my diagnosis was so complex. I hope this isn’t the case with most of us. 

I found that Time is one of the greatest healers. The longer I could stay stable by taking my meds regularly, the better I could heal from the emotional and mental scars from my episodes. I have been more of less stable for a year currently. I have also introduced EFT/tapping as an effective way to bring me out of states of mind that are hard to handle. Otherwise my life has had to become a lot more predictable, with regular routines- regular sleep, exercise and eating, med compliance and avoiding mind altering drugs. 

It also helps to connect with others who have had similar experiences. (I just joined this group-thanks to everyone who has welcomed me!) 

I hope this helps:)"
schizoaffective,epznut2,t3_bwqgf0,1559669276.0,"Warms my heart that you’re so sympathetic and understanding of your girlfriend. Wish everyone with this diagnosis could have someone in their life as eager to be supportive as you are. This can be a very difficult diagnosis, for both for us diagnosed and our loved ones. Not only do we have to experience extremely disorganized and disorientating thinking (which often is completely terrifying), but we also must live and accept ourselves with being permanently “ill” with something that has a very negative social stigma. Because of this, it is easy for us to start feeling less valuable or worthy as a person. It helps to be reminded that there is not something fundamentally “wrong” with us-that our condition not our “fault”...that our experience doesn’t make us less deserving of love. 

One of the most difficult things for me has been being able to connect and be understood by people around me in the throws of an episode. I have the experience of being totally detached from my usual, known reality where I seem to exist in something like a parallel paradigm. This is totally confusing for myself and those around me-especially frustrating when I’m understanding things about that reality that others can’t relate to. The best thing I think loved ones can be is REALLY patient, calm and understanding (even if you don’t understand). Often it is very frightening for us in these mindsets and being told that we are acting “crazy” just confuses us and causes more imbalance. It is nearly impossible for us to recognize our delusions and it’s very ungrounding to be reminded that the reality your currently inhabiting isn’t the same one as your loved ones. 

I wish only the best for you, your girlfriend and everyone living with this and their loved ones. It never hurts to slow down, breathe deeply, sink your feet into the soil/sand, drink a lot of fresh water, get good sleep and avoid stimulants and mind altering drugs. 

Thank you for caring❤️❤️❤️❤️✨"
schizoaffective,epsgd63,t3_bvt79w,1559447966.0,Have you tried EFT/tapping? It has really helped me a lot. Check out Nick Ortner for instructions. It can really be calming and help in difficult situations. Hope this helps. Take good care:)
schizoaffective,epqoi79,t3_bve9vk,1559409567.0,Thanks SO much for sharing! What an incredibly powerful piece of work! I’d be curious if there’s a story behind it- crows/ravens have played very significant roles in my ‘altered states’-looks like you might have had similar experiences?
