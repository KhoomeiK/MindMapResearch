intermittentfasting,fqg52gl,t1_fqfypp7,1589338145.0,"For me my food choices differ between, how much I workout and the weather. So I'll try and sum up the most common ones. Especially in summer I eat more raw food. Also because I'm busy I prefer to have two meals and snack for the rest.

During summer for my first meal at 12 I'll go for more salads, fruit and veggie platters platters, paper rolls, acai bowls and left overs from the night before. I make sure I add some fat and protein. When I'm not too lazy and remember I love a good chia pudding, but I find if I eat them first i'm a bit sluggish for the rest of the day.

Currently it's heading to winter so for my first meal I'm having a sandwich, a piece of fruit and sometimes half a cup of soy yoghurt if it isn't too filling. That's also if I remember to make bread because lots of breads have oil in them and I don't consume oil. I also have porridge and I still have salads but I make a warmer salad. Also usually I have some sort of left over which I consume anyways. Same again for summer I just make sure I have some source of protein and fat on my plate.

I usually snack throughout the day. I have nori sheets, fruit (this last year I have been loving fruit),I make small protein balls out of dates, apple and powdered PB or regular PB depending if I'm going to workout soon or not. I also love banana peanut butter toast. Sometimes theres bakery goods around the house I've made. 

For dinner it constantly changes, I really can't point out what I eat. I'm the kind of person that does not enjoy eating the same dinners too much. Though I would say my go to are;  


 \- Anything Thai, Korean or Japanese I really enjoy. Curries, noodles and tofu with rice and veggies. All so beautiful.  
 \- I love garam masala.   
\- Mexican bowls. Like nacho, burrito and taco bowls.  
\- Pasta. My favourite is gnoochi but I have all.   
\- Oats

When I do eat pasta, rice and bread. I go for wholemeal, as it contains fiber.   
I don't consume oil as it's not apart of the whole food plant based diet, I just get my fats from a different source."

If you do a slow and long term sustainable  diet right once, you don't have to do it again. If you are on and off strict keto. Yes you lose weight fast, but as you said its not long term and not sustainable, so you go into yo-yo dieting which isn't good for your metabolism or hormones and other things. 

Just make small changes. The whole go hard or go home mentally is toxic for healthier living. Also it's important your aim is to be healthy.  Yes you might make a mistake or two, but that's okay. We aren't perfect and there is no need to punish yourself or give up on your journey. One bad meal, one bad day, one bad week and one bad month isn't going affect your journey. Like one good meal, one good day, one good week and one good month is going to make you automatically healthier. Don't get me wrong it's good to start, but it's also important to remember a meal, a day, a week and a month isn't going to ruin your whole journey.

Personality when I started to lose weight I just cut out a few things at a time. Things like cutting out soft drink and fast food. Next was the junk food and I slowly cut that out. You don't to completely cut out anything, you can just lower the amount you have. For me cutting it out was ideal for me.

intermittentfasting,f86uju2,t3_dzbo7h,1574307272.0,"Don’t do anything too extreme do one thing at a time. If you want to do one meal a day slowly cut meals. Example: if you eat three meals a day cut to two and a snack and slowly cut down.

Do an average on what you eat a day, count then calories can cut the calories to 300-500. This gives you room to play with and it doesn’t mess with metabolism, If for example you went from 4000 calories to 1200, one you have a higher chance of binging more but if you don’t when your body gets used to 1200 calories and you no longer lose weight you’ll have to cut more to under 1000. You want to eat as many calories with progress. 


By slowly cutting down your body adjusts and it’s better long term. Short term by cutting down to one meal on keto body you might find yourself falling faster and harder.

If you want to do keto I suggest maybe doing 30/30/40 first. 30 fat and protein and 40 fat and the from there go to keto.

I eat 80/20 which is 80% whole food and 20% treat. I would suggest someone who eats more treat foods to do 50/50 to ease you into it.

That way you can add a little bit of fat and protein, which will keep you fuller and satisfied for longer. Though if that isn't an issue of feeling hungry too soon after looks fine as I have read the comments where you add eggs in the morning.

Also if you want to add more calcium just add any of the following such as more dark greens \* kale and collard greens preferable , seeds,  almonds, edamame or tofu. Chickpeas are actually good for calcium and magnesium.

You don't need to add any of these, these are only suggestions."

HealthyFood,f49qtd8,t3_djq5dt,1571480617.0,"A little tip I’ve learnt is blending your liquid and greens first to its fully blended than adding everything else. It helps blending the greens into the smoothie and you don’t get as much green bits. 

Also frozen fruit makes the drink colder, I’m very lucky to be able to get fresh fruit often but I do prefer frozen in my smoothies and baking. I haven’t tried frozen vegetables but they would be cool but I’m too lazy to prepare them and they don’t sell them frozen where I am.

A few combos I kind of like but I understand they are very basic, but it’s just for when I got nothing else.  I probably have more but my brain is foggy at this time of night ahaha 

Frozen Banana, nut butter and spinach.
Peach, carrot and frozen mango 
Strawberry and tomato
Blackberry and beetroot 
Banana pumpkin 
Apple, avocado, beet, celery, strawberries"
HealthyFood,f49q169,t1_f48plz2,1571479439.0,"There is no such thing as one diet for all, some people want to do keto and cut out all carbs but for some people that  doesn't work. Eating fruit isn't bad and is healthy. 

Also yes fructose is different to other sugar, there is a difference between natural sugar and refined sugar. Fructose being from fruit, honey and dairy products. 

The way your body metabolizes it is what makes it different.  The body breaks down refined sugar rapidly, causing insulin and blood sugar levels to skyrocket. Because refined sugar is digested quickly, you don’t feel full after you’re done eating, no matter how many calories you consumed. The fiber in fruit slows down metabolism, as fruit in the gut expands to make you feel full.    


Fruits doesn't contain added sugar, which is best to avoid but if it's in someone's lifestyle and it works for them I can't judge. Fruit has many more benefits than just fibre, fruit has multiple health promoting  by providing phenols, vitamins, antioxidants and minerals. 

Consuming a recommended daily fruit intake can also help prevent risk catching diseases. I can't tell you which one as each fruit has different benefits.   Eating your fruits helps remove those free radicals that can damage tissues in your body and contribute to many of the leading causes of death. 

So fruit is quite healthy, so it belongs in the sub.

Dietandhealth,f45o7hh,t1_f45kj4u,1571386564.0,"Yeah I saw them too, I didn't really like them but I understood where they are coming from. Though it isn't simple as just eating more.

You can also see a professional to find out the perfect amount of calories for you, having a fast metabolism is just someone who burns calories faster than someone else, but I know some people struggle with this, my brother finally had a good dietician who helped. In Australia you get free dietician visits but if that isn't the case for you I recommend saving for one, because they can help you with answers. Don't do anything like my fitness pal to see calories because they miss a lot of information that is needed to know what you should have. 

I also know people with faster metabolisms stay up later just because they tend to have more energy from eating. So I suggest going to the gym at night if you have this problem, as it burns the energy and it's easier to fall asleep."
Dietandhealth,f44tyf7,t3_dhsk72,1571358802.0,"This honestly sounds like a fad diet/lifestyle that can mess up your metabolism, hormones and  your over around feeling in the long term. It's not a maintainable lifestyle, well it's a really hard and may be very unpleasant. Eating less than 1300 calories doesn't give you any playroom. It's best to eat as much as you can while still maintaining your health or weightloss journey. 

Go from 3000 to 2500 for example, dont go from 3000 to 1200 for example, once your body gets used to 1200 for example it will get used to it and you will need to drop more calories to lose weight to get to what you want if that is your aim.

Same if you were to go to a gym, there is no reason to do a two hour workout if you can get the same results with a 30 minute workout. 

Also you can burn out going extremes leading to either binging, emotional eating or incase of gym for my example you can get injured and not to ever workout ever again. Just keep it simple, eat throughout the day, little calorie, quality food and maintaining exercise. 

When wanting to lose weight or maintain your weight. Your main focus should be nutrition (50%), lifting weights (30%), recovery (15%) and cardio (5%)."
Dietandhealth,f44sbvv,t3_die23v,1571357919.0,"Please don't listen to people who think it's just eating more. My brother has an overactive thyroid which his metabolism works faster, which burns more calories and there can be other medical issues for someone to struggle to gain weight. So if it is a real concern go seek professional help. 

Also as you age your metabolism can change and slow down, there are also other reasons why your metabolism may slow down over time with age. 

Though I think you are at an ideal weight, sometimes living in our society or people we choose to be around us are overweight and can make us look really small. I had that issue, but i'm just at a normal weight. Though if you do want to get a little bigger I suggest you just focus on gaining weight through gaining muscle."

I told them I get really depressed and suicidal for no reason. Just out of the blue and I just want help.

The doctor went to body image to see if that I was an issue and I told her I had none. I’m not scared of food, I’m happy with my body and have a heathy relationship with food. She told me that a lot of girls my age have body issues, but I’m not one of them. I know girls my age who struggle to get help for their disordered eating and body issues and here they are handing out treatment who doesn’t need it or want it.

I just wish they told me they don’t have much they can help me with or a different doctor or something along the lines. I wish they had also listened to me when I told them I don’t have any body/eating issues."

Edit

They could of told me they want to help but need to look more into it can you come back another time. I would of been happy. I know I sound bratty but I just hate wasting time, it’s a pet peeve. I’m grateful they took their time to help nevertheless."

I'm also a qualified trainer with a toned body that isn't maintainable if you have disordered eating."
Dietandhealth,f3oxwyv,t3_ddita0,1571033089.0,"To get more tone, you have to focus on your nutrition, you want a low calorie diet but you don't want anything extreme like 1300. 1300 calories doesn't give you room to play with. You just want something around 1500-1800 depending on your metabolism, but higher the calories while still maintaining results the better. Also you want to up your protein intake compared to normal. Also add weights in, you don't need a crazy work out. Just do the bare minimum with weights, just because you are lifting weights doesn't meal you'll look crazily muscly.   


Don't go extremes, do the bare minimum while still being able to make progress. Doing the bare minimum leaves you room to play with and also is better in the long term if you slowly build your way to eat more calories and harder weights if you feel like that. This also prevents any disordered eating, injuries and a few other things."

Dietandhealth,f3otgh1,t3_ddfdw1,1571028102.0,"To be honest i'm quite concern on your low amount of calories. Look into your nutrition and maybe if you can seek someone as you may be putting your body in starvation mode. Even with intermittent fasting I eat more. Low calorie diets for long periods of time can cause hormonal imbalance and can slow the metabolism. Do you find consideration/focusing hard? Your memory? Fatigue? Headaches? Ask yourself these.  


The best way to do lose weight is mainly focusing on your nutrition. I know you said no weights but lifting lights helps a lot. Just because you lift weights doesn't mean you are going to become huge of muscle, you can be tone and do weights. Also focus on recovery and cardio a bit too, but mainly nutrition. 

Count how many calories you were doing before 1300 and if it was around 2000, you can easily just start with 1500. 1300 doesn't give you much play room to go off. Also have a high protein intake with light weights. You can get light dumbbells or kettlebells and just do it at home. I found cheap ones on facebook. By following this you can lose weight and get toned at the same time"
