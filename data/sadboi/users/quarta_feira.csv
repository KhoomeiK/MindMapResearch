He's overweight and always tough no one would date him, so it was jackpot for him. Me and other friends met her and, despite she was really hot, she was always making fun of him or doing everything in her power to start fights. Then she got pregnant. My friend had to sell most of his stuff to pay for things during this time. After birth, this bitch were always too tired to take care of the baby and the house. My friend had to do all the house work while having a full time job. They lived like this for 2 years and then she left him and got a younger boyfriend. My friend also told us she was terrible during sex, always complaining about having to do it. But she present herself as this big slut that sucked on a thousand cocks. Now my friend has to pay alimony and she never worked a day in her life."
