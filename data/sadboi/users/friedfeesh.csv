I understand the hesitation though. But I’d hope you would at least consider it so your kitty has you around for the long haul. Cats are amazing animals, and it sounds like you have one of the best.

AskWomen,f8oyqri,t3_e1962o,1574692692.0,"I had lost my cat six months prior and my dad told me that I absoutely would not be bringing another cat into the house. So I bought myself / got gift cards towards a Canon DSLR. So I had put in an adoption application on a cat at this local small shelter. The cat had already been spoken for so I figured it was for the best as I wasn’t supposed to have one anyways. I offered to come and take pictures of this small shelters cats just so I could hang out with them. I took pictures of all of the cats, and none of them really wanted anything to do with me. 

The final cage has two senior cats in it and I open the door and come inside and sit on the floor to take pictures of the one closest to me. She wasn’t very interested. My Bella in the bed further to the back hops right out of her bed and comes wandering up. I took some pictures of her and she started rubbing up against me. I had brought some cat treats and a bag of toys. I practically gave them all to her. She won me over with her giant eyes. 

I told the lady who ran the shelter how much I loved her and how sweet and gentle she is. She told me people at come to see her and she had been really fresh with them, but she hadn’t done any of that with me. She told me that Bella had been there for a while, and I told her if she couldn’t find her a home in a month I would take her. 

So a month went by and then I get a message that she’s still there and if I want her she’s mine. I go and talk to my dad expecting him to say no, he sighs and says when is she coming home? And in March will mark two years with my chubby big eyed Disney princess and good lord I love that cat more then anything in the world. 

And now I miss her at work. I mean, not that that is any different then any other day."
