- Yoga. Idk why, but I don't mind this as much and even incorporate some mindfulness and meditation into the exercise. I use the Downdog app and have the speed set on fast, sometimes ""aerobic"" and the app honestly has a ton of settings you can tweak to get the practice perfect for your needs. 
 
- I do floor/body weight/resistance band workouts on my yoga mat, in front of the TV and take like an hour to do 30 minutes worth of exercise. When I get bored I just sit and watch the TV for a few minutes, then do the next move.

When the winter hits my pores appear much smaller, but I suddenly have horrible lines under my eyes and fine lines on the surface of other parts of my face - under eye concealer looks terrible on me in the winter!  

I'm not sure where you live, but in my area summer is suddenly upon us. A month ago it was 60° and pouring rain, now it's nearly 100° every day! And I can see it in my skin - when I look in the mirror I'm horrified how giant my pores look. But fortunately, I've been paying attention for enough years to know it's only temporary. By the middle of summer, my skin somewhat ""adjusts"" and look a bit more normal. Oil blotting sheets, a jade ice roller, and matte sunscreen help. In the winter I bump up moisture and use my AHA a bit less often. 
 
Anyway, I just wanted to give you a bit of hope - if the season is changing where you live, you may think your skin is suddenly looking worse but it's really just reacting to the environment!"

My niners sucked the first 4 years I was watching regularly. Then we got Jimmy, and I was all excited for the 2018 season. Then he got injured and I felt sooo deprived of the season I'd been looking forward to since the end of 2017, that to get my fix I started following other teams, watching redzone on Sundays, and betting on games. I'm not a serious gambler, just fun stuff. I go to Tahoe and do a couple $5 parlays, and then make a bunch of prop bets on specific games. I think the prop bets sealed the deal for me, because you can bet on things like defensive scoring, first player to score, total field goals, total rushing yards, total sacks, and it really forces you to pay attention to stats and specific players in games that you might not have watched otherwise. 
 
Then once interesting players you like or know well start getting traded around, it gives you a reason to tune into other games. Like when Amari Cooper went to Dallas (best friend is a die hard Raider fan), suddenly I'm watching Cowboys games with him. And this year Tom Brady is playing for the Buccs, which will be interesting as fuck, and it'll also be fun to see how the Pats get on without him.

CoronavirusCA,fm9net9,t1_fm9i5z3,1585872334.0,"We're in the same boat! Literally the day they passed the stimulus bill and I was told I was eligible, I put in an application. Here in California, there was a question about whether your unemployment was due to a state crisis with a drop down menu that just happened to have ""public health"" as an option. Now, I've spent the last 5 days wondering if I somehow fucked myself from jumping the gun and applying so soon! But, on the site there is an option to ""start a new claim"" even if you have one in, so I figure worst case scenario is I reapply once they have this sorted out. 
 
I'm beyond grateful that this is an option for all of us. I lost 80% of my clients and work in the last 3 weeks due to their businesses shutting down, and I really had no idea wtf I was going to do because unemployment typically isn't an option for independent contractors and self employed"

I'll listen to it in a bit here though, thank you!"
