ptsd,ffls1bi,t3_etuvu8,1580043340.0,"Hi, I agree to 100%. 
I am diagnosed with PTSD due to neglect, abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and bullying during my childhood. So yeah I have been through alot and I am fully aware of the fact that I am fucked up. I am not able to trust anyone and I very often think that people hate me and/or wants to harm me. 
I have an extremely hard time regulating my emotions and when I get triggered I can burst out and get angry or really really really sad and I am unable to control it. Afterwards I can see what triggered me and see that my thoughts during my outburst is sick (PTSD:n) 

I have a bf since 2,5 years back. 
And sometimes I burst out on him eventhough I am able to see afterwards that the thing that he said was not him saying that he does not love me or the thing that he did was not him saying that he hates me etc 
But in the moment I am not able to think straight and I truly hate myself and my fucking traumas for this. I want to be able to regulate my emotions and I want to be able to take control during those triggering moments who can lead to an outburst of me ranting about how my partner did this or that because he hates me and yada yada 

When I am able to control my feelings we talk very much 
He tells me about how I made him feel, what he meant etc 
And I explain to him that I know that he loves me, that he did not do anything wrong or that my behavior (outburst/hysterical crying -> panic attack) was NOT his fault.

I have said to him and I say very often that he does not have to keep up with this and he tells me that he knows to a 100% but that he choose to by being with me and that it is his choice. I am currently in treatment and will start a PR treatmemt really soon so hopefully it might help me and make me a better girlfriend. 

So in conlusion, I agree, this is my story and I am fully aware and I hope that everyone who has these type of problems try to seek help and communicate with their loved ones who might get caught in the crossfire. And also just to clarify, I do not mean that my behavior is ok I just wanted to tell my story so that others might seek help or just have the long painful but oh so necessary talk with their loved ones and themselves. Yeah we are fucked up and yeah that might make us unintentionally harm others and that is never okay, but let us try to heal by communicating and therapy. I believe in you all, stay strong."

You will find someone, someone that is worth your time just keep on doing things that make you smile and whenever a negative thought comes by try to remember that you are worthy no matter what a dude might have said to you <3"

traumaticchildhood,fa0f7z9,t3_e6tt6o,1575754252.0,"Hi! I totally relate to you! 
It feels like I am an alien to “normal” people and I have a hard time talking about normal stuff because it just seems I don’t know unfamiliar and fake? My therapist has said that this is a thing that is common amongst people who has experienced trauma. We feel alienated and it feels as if it is written on our foreheads ‘damaged’ etc 

I hope that you can feel better now and just send me a DM if you would like to talk more about this stuff. Thank you for bringing it up, it feels nice to not feel alone. Therapist often mention things that people with trauma feels but it kinda doesn’t feel real to me if I can’t talk to someone who confirms it.

Hugs <3"
