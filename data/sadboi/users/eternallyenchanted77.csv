depression,et3i1x6,t3_c9ru6b,1562433804.0,"Yes.Its very hard for me to get to sleep unless I‚Äôve done physical labor.Then when I do sleep,I tend to oversleep nowadays because of depression.I see no purpose on waking up early when my life is filled with so much failure."
depression,et3hpk1,t3_c9qinx,1562433650.0,"I have never really had any friends in my life.That is why I often talk to myself in private & read too much Fanfiction.
People get lonely,you know?
Thank goodness my therapist told me that even though I engage in self talk,I do not have schizophrenia apparently."
depression,et3hdzh,t3_c9r24w,1562433511.0,I‚Äôm glad that happened for you.
rant,et19570,t3_c9cs1q,1562393747.0,"Hey,its a new world & women are becoming more equal to men in different areas of society.Its only natural that these greedy film studios capitalize on that by simply pushing strong females with no plot development.They dont care about the plot or struggle.Its all about the money.The more attractive the woman,the better the ticket sales will be for them."
depression,et0zfof,t3_c9ghaj,1562389437.0,That is so wrong its not even funny.
SuicideWatch,esq0vte,t3_c8oy9i,1562193453.0,"I could‚Äôve written this,its that similar to myself.What I will say is that you are not the one that necessarily needs to change,but society.Society is the fucked up one.Society is the ignorant one that says that people like us are worth less.I think its this Western culture that favors extroverts so much.We don‚Äôt know how to value different types of people,so it must be forced onto us by laws,etc like for people with disabilities.Unfortunately there is no law that can make people be nice to someone because they don‚Äôt have social skills.I wish there was."
SuicideWatch,esq0bec,t1_esnvrsw,1562193157.0,You make some good points.
SuicideWatch,esntmyz,t1_esdwjsb,1562149698.0,Thank you
SuicideWatch,esntjg4,t3_c8lb0t,1562149553.0,"If you feel that bad,it would benefit you to go to the hospital."
SuicideWatch,esntbtp,t3_c8cydf,1562149247.0,I was diagnosed with something similar to autism & have never felt normal.Today I had another mental breakdown spurned by comparing my life to my classmates.People are too lazy to be friends with someone like me.This is a very selfish world but I would encourage you to at least have a few sessions with a therapist.They may be able to help you understand why you feel your life is the way it is.
SuicideWatch,esnt4r6,t3_c8epjl,1562148956.0,"We are the same.Except for a few family members (who I dislike greatly) I have no friends or neighbors or anyone that even knows I‚Äôm alive.Noone cares enough to be friends with me.This world is all me me me & when I die,I will be alone with not even family."
SuicideWatch,esnt0rg,t3_c8ev2f,1562148789.0,There is another subreddit on here for goodbye letters but maybe you should talk all of this out with a therapist first just to understand yourself better.

depression,eslbc4h,t3_c89a0y,1562082612.0,"I am exactly the same as you.Without college,I have no life."
angry,esfhmgi,t3_bydblk,1561926377.0,"Actually,if your income has changed then the FAFSA can be updated with your parents current income.Legally,they have to evaluate your current need based on your actual current income (and not past tax returns).Just go to your college‚Äôs Financial Aid Supervisor & tell them your dad changed jobs & you need to adjust your income on the FAFSA.

Seperately,your parents need to sell that house & maybe rent for awhile until things improve."
