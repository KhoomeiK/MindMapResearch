CancerFamilySupport,fdhrzws,t1_fdhq5rf,1578429041.0,"that’s how I feel about going back in the fall too honestly but if you do decide to go back this semester I would tell a professor, dean, and/or advisor about your situation immediately, so they can give you advice on what to do and maybe help you along. I told one of my professors like 2 weeks after I found out, and she gave me a big hug and told me that if I needed to talk about things I could always talk to her"
