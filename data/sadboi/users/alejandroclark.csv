Pure O OCD is an illness of constant reassurance. I'm going to presume you seek reassurance in many other areas of your life?

Psychonaut,flx75e0,t1_flx6z29,1585576773.0,"I recorded an exercise people can use to be a psychonaut by using their own mental power.

Being a psychonaut is all about being an explorer of your own mind. This hypnosis does exactly that.

I want to help people find answers they seek in a safe way."

Boobs were not always biological sex symbols like they are now. In many countries to this day, they are not seen as sex symbols."

NatureIsFuckingLit,flnbxvi,t1_flmj4ye,1585315042.0,"Maybe, just maybe, it has something to do with being so slow they don't trigger the predator chase response.

I saw a video of a wild horse who had been raised near dogs. It encountered a pack of wolves in the wild and sauntered up to them and plopped on the ground and rolled on its back.

The wolves were like, ""I think I'm supposed to eat you but you're not running..."" and so it lived."
Entrepreneur,flmooec,t3_fpo48x,1585290529.0,"I can't find the quote but it's said that when Alexander the Great was in India, his troops tried to mutiny.

This was after years of long, grueling campaigns. Battles where Alexander the Great had been leading the charge into combat.

Allegedly, he gathered those who wanted to rebel and stripped his armor so all could see the various scars he wore after the many wars he'd been fighting alongside his men.

He said something like, ""if anyone thinks they have fought harder than I have, raise your hand.""

No one raised their hands.

Now, I don't know if this story is complete bullshit or not.

This is a time for compassion, but not weakness.

I suggest you tell your staff your current situation. Break it down for them. Let them see the inside of the business. Take off your armor. How much runway do you have? How much are you taking home? Etc.

Then, tell them calmly, ""if anyone still thinks I am being unfair, get the fuck out.""

It's best to do this from horseback dressed in armor but it still might be effective in normal attire."
