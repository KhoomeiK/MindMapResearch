The country could handle being more tolerant. They have gone so far backwards in the last 40 years, and it should be highlighted when we discuss treaties with them.

Every group lobby's for the issues most important to them, and the LGBT community should really be lobbying for this in talks with Iran and they choose not to.

In Palestine case. They don't even have borders (atm) and they already have it illegal. It should be a requirement for them to get sovereignty to treat gay people with respect. To legalize it in the minimum, in order for us to help them establish a real state.

Not to say your country is less important, just that this discussion is about ""conservatives"" calling out Muslims for gay rights abuses. 

The biggest examples of those is for Iran and The Palestinian territories. 

Those two countries get lots of sympathy from many Americans and do not get held accountable for there LGBT policies.

Countries like Iran and even the Palestinian territories (which are both very big political subjects in US politics). As well as the countries in Trump's ""Muslim ban"". 

Now to your second point, people who are openly xenophobic and racist and use these things to make their points, it clearly had nothing to do with LGBT or human rights. 

However, the majority of conservatives aren't openly racist or xenophobic (imo) and that majority do make the point about the double standard with how we treat some of those countries as if they are half decent democracies even though they have gross human rights abuses against gay people.

I'm not a conservative, I identify as independent and moderate, I'm gay myself as well and I don't believe in racist or xenophobic (I'm not sure if or how I would be able to prove that).

It does bother me a lot the fact that gays are treated that way in those Muslim countries, particularly because I've chatted with quite a few people stuck there that are gay who have really suffered, and they feel like there countries get a lot of sympathy in the US, without any accountability for there behavior towards gays.

Tell her how much you care about her and explain that what your gonna say has nothing to do with her and all to do with you and tell her you can prove it.

Then explain, tell her your recently realized your more attracted to guys then girls and that you didn't say anything because you did always and still do care about her, and this is just a sexual thing that you can't really help.

I feel terrible for you that you are in this difficult situation, but you are blessed to have the support of your wife in this and to be doing the therapy.

This augh to be a lesson to the repercussions of people ignoring there sexuality and trying to pretend it doesn't exist.

I don't know what the solution is, I'm sure you've spent more time thinking about it then me, and I hope you can now make the correct decisions and make yourself happiest possible in the circumstances. 

Good luck brother, and keep in mind that we don't blame you oh, we know what society does to us all, certain communities in certain lifestyles worse than others, you did your best, now you keep doing your best and hopefully you'll find peace."

You can be helpful, but it's not your responsibility, remember that it's very important.

A healthy relationship with your brother now would be a fun relationship. Leave it to your parents and his teachers to discipline him and to tell him how to behave.

You can be there for him, be fun, be helpful. Take him out on trips to places he will enjoy, talk to him about things that interest him.

If he happens to open up to you or ask for advice about his bad habits, that will be your opportunity to help, but other then that, don't do it because it most likely won't work.

And keep in mind, even if he does ask, be subtle and easy about it. Don't push, just offer suggestions without emotional attachment. This is the most likely way you would be able to help him.

Be there for him that is the most important thing for him now, and probably forever as a brother.

Remember, it's not your responsibility, and you can help so much by just being there for him. (Mental health and just overall healthy relationship for your brother)"

The way I describe it is, a few more hours of peace. Some people are disturbed (myself included) we can't be happy by the regular things that make others happy.

Therapy can help us have a few more bareaable hours a day or a week and that's not a cure by any means, but it is a small relief.

Btw, I don't ever agree with my therapists. I constantly chalenge them to find new things and reasons. They are just educated in what's going on with us and they try there best to give some relief."

This issue is so much bigger then say the wage gap, while it would be nice if we could get rid of that too, that it just bothers me that its almost completely neglected compared to much smaller issues.

Oh and please show me 1 issue in the world today that causes more human rights abuses then Islam? If it weren't Islam, the people wouldn't follow it.

The only country in the world that these minorities are as oppressed as they are in these Muslim countries is North Korea. And we all have a very different view on that.

Let's say it how it is. 

Islam, the way it is practiced today is the leading cause of human rights abuses against woman and LGBT people.

Not white people refusing to make a cake for a gay couple. (Which btw, I don't agree with either, it just isn't nearly as bad as the way Muslims treat us)"
changemyview,fpwpure,t1_fpwh02e,1588967784.0,"I'd be happy to have a discussion about that as well, but that's not really the topic here.

The fact is, Islam is the single largest human rights abuse motivator in the world today. Call it how it is.

There may be some who denounce that part of Islam but the overwhelming majority, as well as the places where it counts (governments - mine and your thoughts about it are irrelevant to most) perpetuate a gross number of human rights abuses.

I just don't understand why liberals go to such lengths to find reasons not to make this enemy #1 to human rights today. It's just so obvious. 

Gays, woman and so many other areas where the world has progressed so much, Muslims in Muslim countries all over the world are persecuted."
