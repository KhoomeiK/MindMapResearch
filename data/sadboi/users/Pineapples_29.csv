She has a glass of wine every now and then but never like before when she would hoard vodka.. hiding it around the house. I know how terrible it is to remember..

Depersonalization,fqc8dya,t1_fqc77ca,1589252288.0,Random add on: I remember a few years back I went to Hawaii and I just wanted to really remember it so I went by myself out to the beach and just sat while a storm rolled in and I felt the sand and the water and smelled the air... just trying to take it all in and it worked I guess because I can really remember that one moment. It was rough. It’s like why even go on vacation when you’re not even “there” you know??
Depersonalization,fqc86ps,t1_fqc77ca,1589252164.0,I’m not sure yet. I think I just was on the same thing too long. Apparently you gotta switch it up every once in awhile (depends on the person). For now I’m doing good and it’s working so I guess in a way yes. It’s always good to try new things (also scary because you never know how it’ll effect you). So far so good for me though. I hope you can find the right one. And yes.. depersonalization sucks and I hate it. There are things you can do over time like grounding techniques and just working to reduce your stress as a whole but it’s hard. Some days I feel like I’m not even a real person and then others I feel like I’m seeing the world for the first time.

I woke up one morning at 3 am to her siblings crying and screaming only to find her little body.. uhg it was so hard. I actually cried. I’m an emotional person so it’s not hard to make me cry but she was my baby at that point.

mentalhealth,fpaooyb,t1_fpaffyc,1588452527.0,"“Since the outbreak began in December, many estimates of the fatality rate have been calculated and reported. The CDC, World Health Organization, and others have reported rates of 3.4% overall, and less than 1% in certain age groups.”

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200331/covid-19-death-rate-drops-still-deadly-to-seniors

So at first they tell us we’re all gonna die and that this is the worst pandemic we’ve ever seen then the real numbers come in and we have 3.4 chance of actually dying. 

“CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza”

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html

Every single year we see fluctuating numbers from the seasonal flu which can end up being up in the 50,000 range yet we still go on.. no lockdowns 

“The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that flu-associated deaths in the US ranged from about 3000 to 49,000 annually between 1976 and 2006. The CDC notes that the often-cited figure of 36,000 annual flu-related deaths was derived from years when the predominant virus subtype was H3N2, which tends to be more lethal than H1N1.”

https://www.medscape.com/answers/219557-3459/what-is-the-global-incidence-of-influenza#qna

This is WHY I don’t see the reasoning in this. If you really wanted to protect everyone and claim that basic rights are impeding your life.. then stop driving cars, stop leaving your house, stop working and doing things you like to do because you could kill someone or yourself in these everyday risks."
