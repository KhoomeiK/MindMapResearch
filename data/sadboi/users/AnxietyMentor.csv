Anxiety can cause a myriad of symptoms. Sure, get a second or third opinion by all means but if all three doctors tell you it's anxiety, then you need to accept it. Otherwise you will go from doctor to doctor seeking reassurance anytime you get anxious just to get reassured. It becomes a vicious cycle which can last for years if not addressed properly. Of course your symptoms could be due to a medical condition and that's why you would get a second opinion or a third at the most. Also, the drug you mentioned is a stimulant as are cigarettes. These certainly would not help your anxiety. Have you considered reducing/eliminating these stimulants to see if that makes a difference?

The point is that there is no scientific evidence to support the chemical imbalance theory. The quotes in the video are not my opinion. I have directly quoted various experts in the field. Going to a psychiatrist and getting treatment and then feeling better does not prove that any kind of mental illness is caused by a chemical imbalance. If you think it does then you really need to explain that. Attacking me isn't proving anything. I have much empathy for people and that is a big part of the reason I made this video.

Like you said, they can't prove it as they have no tests. It's completely normal to feel messed up after going through a traumatic experience. Anyone who went through that would struggle to deal with it. It's completely normal. It doesn't mean that something bad happened to you and because of that you developed a disease. Psychiatrists are so full of shit and have zero evidence to back up their claims. Let's look at this objectively. They have no evidence that Bipolar is a disease and they have no evidence that you even have bipolar. Doesn't sound like there any compelling reasons to believe their ""scientific diagnosis"". Yes the ""disease"" is subjective (like you say) as psychiatrists seem to think you have it despite no objective evidence. Don't listen to their pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo. Trust me, it's all about them making money and dressing up your diagnosis as science. Yes, it's possible to live with out those drugs. They will fuck you up beyond repair. Maybe not now, but in time. Then you won't be able to function on or off the drugs. If you do stop though, slow tapering methods are suggested because withdrawaling suddenly can fuck you up too. The reason why they say it will take years to discover is because your brain is perfectly healthy but when they do a brain scan on you in 10 years time it will look fucked, not because of a disease but because of the psychiatric medication. At that point they will tell you that your brain is typical of someone with Bipolar. They know that they caused this brain damage but they are only self interested. They don't give a fuck about you.

Do you believe in that diagnosis?

How many ECT's did you have?

Are you still on medication?

I think Robert Whitaker is great. I never heard anyone speak on the topic with as much knowledge as him. Psychiatry can't refute what he says so they just try to discredit him. It's pathetic really. Yes, psychiatry isn't helping anyone. It harms everyone with psychiatric drugs being the 3rd biggest cause of death worldwide. It was difficult for me to believe in psychiatry considering my mother had only deteriorated over the years. If these drugs were correcting an underlying chemical imbalance then surely she would have been well and truly cured by now if the drugs worked. The system needs to change, that's for damn sure. I am not sure about the likelihood of it happening but in my opinion the only way to stop these scumbags is by bringing awareness to as many people as possible. The less people believe in biological psychiatry the less victims there will be.

Just to clear things up and provide some more background:

I said in the intro that the psychiatrist didn't diagnose him with schizophrenia but said that he would have to be on medication for the rest of  his life.

I agree that in many countries **""Psychiatrists need a ""diagnosis"" to justify the drugs (they tell the insurance company of the ""diagnosis"" and write it in the person's medical record).""** This is true even in Indonesia but the thing is that Rhaka never went down the path of taking the medication. She suggested to him that he needs it and it is her belief that he would be better off with it but he knew from the beginning that this was a path that he didn't want to take and to this psychiatrists credit, she did not force it upon him. Therefore a diagnosis was not necessary.

**""Essentially psychiatrists label practically everyone who speaks to them, and they can share their ""diagnosis"" with other psychiatrists and never let you know. Even if you request your medical record you'll never find out what the psychiatrist labelled you with.""**

\- I am not so sure about this. Perhaps this might be true in some cases or in some countries but I can't be certain. Where is this common practice? USA? What I am certain of though, in Australia at least, is that if you request your medical record, you will see exactly what you have been diagnosed with.

What I said makes perfect sense but I can't be held accountable for others inability to understand it. Regardless, what I am suggesting is to do research before taking any of these drugs. Weigh up the evidence or lack thereof and make a decision. If you don't agree that's fine. Thank you."

mentalhealth,f02ue7p,t1_f00ebqm,1568338411.0,"I would definitely give it another go. I experienced severe depression for a long time and also anxiety disorder for over 15 years. I would definitely give intermittent fasting another go. It may take some time as everyone is different but I would give it at least a couple of weeks to see if you notice any improvement. In my experience the brain fog fades away, I begin to feel mentally sharp and able to really engage in what is going on. I also feel more relaxed and more confident. My theory as to why intermittent fasting helps brain fog and other things too:

1: Blood sugar is not being spiked as often, therefore we don't experience the crash as often, therefore our blood sugar levels and our mood stays more even (I used to eat anytime I felt like my sugar was too low -makes brain fog much worse doing this).

2. Because you are giving your body long periods of time without food, it actually has the time to process it. I think us constantly putting food in our mouths places a massive stress on our body and it simply struggles to keep up.

3. If you do ingest any stimulants, you are also giving your body adequate time to process them (as long as it's not much - I am not talking about 47 cups of coffee a day :)) - but preferably don't ingest any stimulants. If you have to, really try to limit it.

Intermittent fasting can also help to alleviate anxiety and depression because many people will engage in eating in order to avoid the uncomfortable feelings of anxiety and depression. We are using food to feel good. If you discipline yourself not to reach for food when feeling any kind of discomfort you are essentially facing those emotions head on. While this can feel uncomfortable, it is the kind of counter-intuitive behaviour that makes us feel better in the long run.

I personally don't restrict my calories but I eat my first meal at 1pm. I have my second meal at 5pm and third at 9pm. Then I fast from 9pm to 1pm the next day.

\*\*A crucial point is to not snack at all\*\*\* A big reason this works is that we are only spiking our blood sugar levels 3 times in the entire day. People who are snacking might spike it perhaps 5-20 times a day.

I do this all the time now because I know in the past that every time I practiced fasting for a decent amount of time I would notice the impact it had on my mental clarity. It only made sense to do it all the time. Yes, it's difficult to start but after a while you start to feel much much better. 

I hope this is helpful to you."
mentalhealth,ezw9601,t3_d2nu5x,1568211159.0,"Like you said, brain fog is a very common symptom of anxiety and depression. It is also very common when our blood sugar levels are all over the place because of frequently eating and snacking. We are constantly spiking our blood sugar and the more times we spike it, the more times we feel a crash. This can also result in us feeling anxious and depressed. I have personally found that reducing stimulants and intermittent fasting really helps with brain fog. If you stick to it, intermittent fasting will make you feel very mentally sharp. It will also alleviate anxiety and depression, especially if you reduce the stimulants too."
Anxietyhelp,ezowca4,t1_ezmz2j4,1568029196.0,It's not false. If you claim it is false then you need to provide evidence for chemical imbalances being the cause of anxiety or any other mental disorder. Simply because medication made you feel better doesn't mean that people need them or that they are correcting a chemical imbalance. You need to give evidence for this. You can't just claim this without evidence and then state that other people's comments are false because they disagree with something that has never been proven.
Anxietyhelp,ezhq9vl,t1_ezgcozn,1567914350.0,"Of course, I struggled with anxiety disorder for over 15 years and eventually overcame it through educating myself about it and taking the necessary steps towards recovery.

Some people will get it and others will not because they won't take the time to educate themselves and like you said, they want to cling to this chemical imbalance theory so they don't have to take responsibility for overcoming their anxiety. There are also others that just do not realise that the chemical imbalance theory was never a scientific fact and I can't say I blame them (considering how pervasive this ""science"" was). Perhaps if everyone knew this and knew the real cause of anxiety it would be more likely that they would do what it takes to overcome it.

Thanks for your comment."
Anxietyhelp,eze7e23,t1_ezb7f6a,1567860108.0,"Before considering taking medication I would suggest doing some research. There is in fact no scientific evidence that any of these medication work in the way that doctors suggest. For example, they say that anxiety and depression is caused by low serotonin. The problem is that there is no evidence to support this. There is also mounting evidence of how dangerous these drugs are. Sure, some people might report that they feel better taking them but that does not mean that they are correcting your serotonin levels or are fixing a problem. If I drink a few whiskeys I might feel better but it should in no way be considered evidence that it is actually fixing a ""problem"" in your brain. For your own sake, please do some research and discover what anxiety is. Anxiety is simply an emotion. It is mostly brought on by imagining that something bad is going to happen just like excitement is brought on by imagining that something good will happen. It really comes down to changing how you think and behave. I have been down this road and can tell you that it will get you nowhere. There is nothing wrong with you. You have anxiety, so what. That does not mean there is anything wrong with you. Anxiety is a completely normal result of how you are thinking and behaving. When we are anxious, stress hormones are released into the body and inevitably will result in a panic attack when stress levels become very high. If you want to know more please let me know and you don't have to take my word for it. Please do some research and then decide. I wouldn't wish any of these psychoactive drugs on my worst enemies. They are chemical lobotomies."
Anxiety,eyz09dg,t3_czl4dw,1567606475.0,Well done. Celebrate!!!
Anxiety,eyyouev,t3_czhxjy,1567597150.0,"Hey mate,

It totally relate to your situation. It sounds very much like mine when I was younger. I went down the medication and psychiatrist route but none of those things helped. They actually made things far worse. The problem with psychiatrists is that they will try to convince you that there is something wrong with you, that is why they give you a diagnosis, to convince you that there is something wrong. Psychiatrists way of dealing with any kind of behaviour/disorder is through psychoactive substances. They will give you a drug such as an anti-depressant and will tell you that it will correct a chemical imbalance in your brain which is apparently causing your anxiety/depression. They say that anxiety and depression are caused by low levels of serotonin in the brain. The issue is that there is no evidence to support this. The chemical imbalance theory was widely accepted by the public to be true and many still believe it til this day but this was never true. Big pharmaceutical companies have even admitted this in open court under immense pressure. Also, I am sure there was no blood test performed on you to show that you have a low serotonin level? That is because there is no such test.

Another issue is that doctors and psychiatrists steer you down the wrong path. By convincing you that there is something wrong with your brain they deter you from understanding what anxiety and depression really are. Anxiety and depression are simply emotions. For example if you imagine winning the lottery you may start to feel excited. If you imagine a good time you had when you were a kid you might feel happy. If you imagine stuffing up a speech you will feel anxiety. It really is just an emotion. Understanding it is key. I used to imagine all kinds of worse case scenarios and then I would feel extreme anxiety and then the depression would soon follow because I felt helpless against what I thought would be my future.

My life turned around when I threw all my medication in the bin after realising that doctors and psychiatrists had no idea what they were talking about. I just decided to start living and getting out and doing things. The more you tell yourself that you can't do something because of the anxiety and depression the more power you give to it and the more intense you will feel it. If you have the attitude that you are going to do whatever you want and that the anxiety and depression can come along for the ride then you give yourself permission now to live your life and you will find that these negative emotions will naturally lessen over time.

I would also set some goals and begin to imagine you achieving those goals. When you do this it's kind of the opposite of imagining the worst case scenario. You are imagining things going exactly as you want. This is a great way to turn anxiety into excitement. Instead of imaging the worst case scenario, imagine the best case. If you imagine the worst you feel anxious and depressed, if you imagine the best you will feel calm or even excited. The next step is to take action and start working towards those goals.

Anxiety thrives on fear. Don't let it beat you down. Go about your life and let it come for the ride. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, instead of resisting the feeling welcome it. More than anything get out and live your life. I achieved great things whilst in the midst of anxiety such as doing 3 years in the army and finishing 2 degrees at university. Over time if you keep persisting and living your life you will find that anxiety and depression will have less of an effect on you.

If you have any questions please let me know. I have made a few videos on YouTube about some of this stuff. Perhaps they can be of some help. There will be more to come. Plus, you are not a complete failure. It just feels like that. You can achieve great things. Trust me.

I hope what I have said helps.

Here is one of the videos. There are a couple others on the channel too.

AskDocs,eyqgcxw,t3_ck09am,1567342046.0,"You mention that you are taking Zoloft. Is that because you experiencing anxiety or depression? Frequent urination can be caused by a number of things but anxiety and stress can also bring this about. You mention a number of things that make me think that it could be anxiety/depression related. I struggled with frequent urination for many years due to anxiety and stress. Basically, when we are stressed or anxious, stress hormones are released into the body and this can cause a whole host of anxiety symptoms (I call them anxiety symptoms because they are caused by our own anxiety) including a churning stomach, irritability, shaking, sweating plus many more. One of the most common symptoms brought about by anxiety and stress is frequent urination. If your frequent urination is caused by stress and anxiety then there is nothing to be concerned about. Again, assuming your frequent urination is brought about by anxiety and stress, reducing your stress and anxiety will certainly help to reduce the frequency. Under-reacting to the frequent urination will also help. When we have uncomfortable feelings and symptoms like this it is our instinctive reaction to resist them and try to get them to go away. This only makes it worse. Under-reacting and allowing it to be will definitely help. I know it sounds counter-intuitive but symptoms such as frequent urination thrive on fear. If we have an attitude of letting it be, it will naturally fade away. I made a video about this recently which I hope helps to explain things better. I wish you all the best :)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92pnbfqZ6Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92pnbfqZ6Tc)"
