AskWomen,fj1606e,t3_fatvv7,1582913617.0,"When I look back at my childhood all I think of is the arguments I had with, the amount of shouting and screaming at each other. I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs a terrible father. In all aspects except emotionally, he‚Äôs great at it. Though I wish he would‚Äôve been more supportive of my choices and were more patient with me when I was younger. 

Again, he‚Äôs not a terrible father, but I think I have some leftover trauma from the amount of arguments we had. And I definitely have his temper. Because of this I always have to watch how I act around others (since I can‚Äôt lash out) and I have to control my temper all the time. And sometimes when it‚Äôs too much I do end up lashing out and I always regret it. 

It‚Äôs a tiring thing to do, to constantly ‚Äúwatch‚Äù myself, but it‚Äôs important to me because I don‚Äôt want to hurt others the same way my father sometimes unintentionally hurt me."
mentalhealth,fijzl6h,t3_f89un5,1582468911.0,"Sometimes I can‚Äôt help but to ‚Äúoverreact‚Äù and I only realise that I‚Äôve overreacted when the problem dies down. I understand that this is an issue I face with myself but also being told that I‚Äôm overreacting makes me feel shittier than I already do. I guess it‚Äôs just the way they phrase it. But I don‚Äôt blame them, I know how frustrating it can be."

FoodPorn,fifwu2v,t1_fifud2p,1582393996.0,"It was my first time eating there! The beef bowl was not bad, the beef was really soft but the black sugar miso was a little too sweet for my liking.. the radish helped to tone down the sweetness though so it‚Äôs all good. 

I didn‚Äôt try the chirashi bowl because I‚Äôm not a fan of raw fish (don‚Äôt kill me lol) but I tried a bit of the snow crab and it was pretty good! 

We also ordered the Wham! fries which had melted umami cheese, spice, guacamole, tomato, sour cream and marshmallows. Surprisingly the marshmallows went well with the rest of the stuff and it didn‚Äôt taste weird at all.

Well to be honest it wasn‚Äôt as amazing as I‚Äôve heard it to be but it was still a nice experience and I‚Äôd definitely go back to try something new."
psychologystudents,fifqb6m,t1_fibsn97,1582392195.0,"Unfortunately for this module we don‚Äôt have lecture slides! It‚Äôs a hybrid course (2 weeks face to face, the rest online) and we have to make our own notes from scratch. 

My learning style is kinda similar to yours but I think I‚Äôm panicking a little due to the nonexistent lecture slides and me feeling like my notes are never enough (since we barely have face to face lectures and no ~extra details~ to transfer into our notes). But I guess it‚Äôs also a good thing as it forces me to search things up and be more independent in my learning lol. I just worry that I overestimate my understanding and end up flunking an exam because of it. Oh well.

But thank you so much for the tips, I guess I just have to try different ways and see which one fits best!"

psychologystudents,fiayg9m,t1_fi86e19,1582310906.0,"Thank you for taking time to type out this response, this is really helpful! 
 
I was wondering how do you write out your notes? Do you just use a lined paper and write out the concepts/definitions line by line or do you find mind maps better? I usually do the former but I‚Äôm trying to find new ways to write my notes.. sometimes they get a little overwhelming and I end up stressing myself out (too many irrelevant stuff I didn‚Äôt even know were irrelevant or too little info on the impt stuff!!)."
studyAbroad,fi79dm4,t1_fi6xubh,1582216945.0,"I‚Äôm not studying in Germany but according to the little research I‚Äôve done, most masters degrees are conducted in English (or least Psychology).

AskReddit,fhruzy0,t3_f4i8nv,1581839996.0,"This isn‚Äôt the only reason but one reason that made me think, wow. 

I asked him how would he react if another guy came up to him and said he was interested in him. He said he would be flattered and would take it as a compliment rather than be disgusted by it. 

It seems like I‚Äôm getting amazed by a guy doing the bare minimum but I rarely hear guys reacting positively to situations like this and it‚Äôs sad. They are always ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay with gays as long as they don‚Äôt like me‚Äù and it has always annoyed me."

You mentioned that your episodes happened at home. So I guess you can.. kinda.. act however you want and take your own time to cool down..? But have you experienced a time where an episode took place outside of home? Was there any ~strategies~ that helped you cope better?"
AskReddit,fhqtnyg,t1_fhqqs6t,1581811263.0,"Thank you for sharing! 

I‚Äôm wondering if you had to come in to get a ‚Äúproper‚Äù evaluation? Like did they make you take any tests or did they just ask you questions about your history and experiences? Basically what was the process of your evaluation?"
AskReddit,fhqtalc,t1_fhqpt87,1581810993.0,"Thank you for this. I wasn‚Äôt so sure what the differences between the two were, but this helped me understand. 

I‚Äôm currently seeing a counsellor (and a psychiatrist but I don‚Äôt see her as much) and I requested an evaluation for generalised anxiety disorder, but after doing a bit more research I realised that maybe it‚Äôs more than just that.  Though I do understand that it‚Äôs a bit more complicated to diagnose BPD because of its overlapping symptoms.. I guess I just have to see how it goes :-)"
