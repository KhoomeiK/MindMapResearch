The largest species is 30cm long (thanks for the nightmares), but the common garden snail is about 3 inches long or 7.5cm in normal units.
The average height of humans is 175cm so roughly 175/7.5 = ~23 times the length of a snail.
A marathon is 42.2km or 42200/1.75 = ~24100 human heights.
If we go by this number and calculate the equivalent of a snail marathon we get 7.5*24100=180750cm or around 1.8km (just a bit more than a mile in retard units).
The widest road I could find is 13 lanes in each direction. The standard for a lane's width is 3.7 meters so if we add both sides and assume a shoulder width of 1m to make the numbers simpler we get a width of 100m.
