AskWomen,fpdvdgg,t3_gcrysl,1588534992.0,"I was sure that in order to overcome strong emotions like ""love"" you need an equally strong emotion like ""anger"".So long-term distance and anger were my solution towards this guy and when we met after some time I felt normal so also huge relief.

But this relief didn't last long ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Apparently those two things are not always working, not for everyone. Or I'm just dumb."

You now, you write your stuff together in some visible order on paper, so it looks like everything is in right place. Cleans my mind from chaos."
BPD,fovvp56,t1_fovqzga,1588108341.0,"That's actually interesting as I'm quite BPD as well. 
I assume that you ask occassionally? I've been ""teached"" by my ex that asking too mamy questions annoys other people, that's why I'm afraid to even ask - or that I could make somebody sad by sounding like im disappointed of their actions."

AskWomen,fimi8cn,t3_f8golc,1582531419.0,"I moved to another city to have a fresh start. It has its cons and pros - new start is healthy but whole solitude and living on my savings was destructible. Even tho I keept looking for a job and recently got it! And I believe I will make new friends there.

So I can only advise to be strong and survive this episode in your life. Remember to reach your close friends or family each time you will feel lonely or sad, don't hold it for yourself - that thing is poisonous  and destructible as hell."

In my previous company as IT helpdesk, I had only few tasks and mostly I was browsing Reddit or play MTG with my TL. 
In my current job as 1st/2nd line, even with 3 monitors, I can barely handle all stuff and cannot go to toilet as there is huge amount of work.

Recently I even realized to feel anxcious while sitting too close to my own brother, even tho he has never touch me or joked about me in in bad way. 

This shit is terrifying and I'm not sure if I'll be in any future 'normal' relationship and not feel bad about any sexual stuff. That also bites me as I havent got similar problem in previous relationships (unfortunately mental abusive and toxic).

Thank you and stay strong."

I was after tumor removal and was holding my belly as this wound hurt a lot, but all he could say was ""don't hold your belly like that otherwise others will think you're pregnant"" with serious tone. Of course few weeks later after mentioned feeling anxcious around him ""he was just joking"". Flirting with others was also ""a joke""."
