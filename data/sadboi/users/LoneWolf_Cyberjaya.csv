Utilising a strategy like the Pomodoro technique works too!"

Things must have been difficult for you.

Perhaps you’re facing tribulations and difficulties, disappointments and frustrations, or some other stuff that’s annoying. 

Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on, if you need someone to talk to, just remember that I’m here for you. If you’re willing to open up, DM me. I’ll be all ears.

Anyways, promise me that you’ll take good care of yourself, all right?"
depression,eptd5wj,t3_bvup45,1559487651.0,"Regularly I feel that too. It’s kinda like getting distracted with sad feelings when you should be enjoying a cherishable moment in life, and sometimes it struck me so hard that I become emotional and start having an existential crisis, often times forgetting about what I was doing at hand. I’ve talked with a senior at school about this, turns out he’d experienced it too. To me, it seems like a normal situation faced by a lot of us, especially youths nowadays, so I don’t feel the need to overthink it as an “issue”. For me, when I view something as an “issue”, I tend to have a lower self confidence to face it; if I view something as a common situation, I tend to be more confident in facing it, knowing that a lot of other people face it too. In the midst of feeling down, talking to a friend, going for a sport or doing something else in general normally helps out (it worked for me). Anyways, if you’re attempting to reduce the feeling of being down, you should try out different methods and see which one works well for you, sometimes it’s in the form of mindset, and sometimes habits.

P/S: I’m a newbie on Reddit, do let me know if I can improve on my comments/posts as well as some tips and tricks ;)"
