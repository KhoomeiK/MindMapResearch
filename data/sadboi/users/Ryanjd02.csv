Q8. If not, then do you have any clue as to why they are abusive?

Q9. Why do you still want to work things out with them?

By the way, you can still call the cops on them for doing this. Since you're legally an adult, it isn't abuse anymore, it's assault. And it is possible to press charges against your parents, so if I were you, I would do just that. I hope you do call the cops andlor are able to stay at a friend's house.

The Coronavirus hasn't even been around for a year, so, it still is an unreasonable comparison.

The virus is not an aggressive Flu. In fact, the chance of dying from the Flu is higher than from the Coronavirus.

The reason the country has been shut down is because there's too many severely disabled people that think the Coronavirus is fake, therefore spreading it even more.

If you [click/press here](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/covid-19-coronavirus-top-ten-most-affected-countries/) you'll find that the US has the most Coronavirus cases out of every other country. And [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1093256/novel-coronavirus-2019ncov-deaths-worldwide-by-country/) you'll find that America ALSO (unsurprisingly) has the most deaths, sitting at around 86,000 which is a whopping 29% of ALL THE COMBINE DEATHS WORLDWIDE (I round up because by tomorrow or Saturday it will be 86k+) with the UK in 2nd place with a HUGE death difference, sitting at about 33,000.
