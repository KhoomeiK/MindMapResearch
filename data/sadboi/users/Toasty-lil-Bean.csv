But then, on the bad days, I remember that the good days are a blessing. That they’re a reminder that I’m healing and - yes, my ptsd may not be as severe as some people’s - but that’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s a wonderful thing.

There are a lot of triggers that used to bother me infinitely more than they do now. I used to break down every time I saw an orange street light and have to pull over or dissociate whenever someone expressed even slight romantic interest.  Neither of those things really bother me anymore. 

For me, healing hasn’t meant that the memories go away, the flashbacks stop, or triggers stop being triggers. It has just meant that when a trigger comes, I can dismiss it bc I have control. Or when I flashback, I can break out of it faster. 

I think it’s just a process of learning to understand your own patterns and why they happen. Therapy helps immensely. Self care can also help alleviate some of the stress that is causing your flashbacks.

By giving control, I mean like avoiding loud, abrupt, or startling actions. 

Definitely recommend asking her what her triggers are and what she wants you to do if she has a flashback while you’re with her. (And don’t blame yourself when flashbacks inevitably happen. Personally, my SO blaming themself makes me feel guilty and makes me not want to tell them when I have flashbacks.)

The best thing that I’ve done that has alleviated this problem somewhat is to talk to her when there is no issue/argument and establish that if I say I can’t do something, then that needs to be the end of conversation. I know what I need.

To my knowledge, it wasn’t important for insurance. The diagnosis has made it easier for me to understand my symptoms, but I don’t know that it has changed much. I like the comfort of knowing I don’t have to give people a lengthy explanation of whats wrong with me bc if I tell them it’s ptsd, then their response is usually something along the lines of “oh, the veteran thing” or “cool, so flashbacks, then,” which is close enough for me."

That will at least make them more bearable. For example my checklist is: 

1) don’t touch me 
2) don’t let me close my eyes 
3) keep me talking 
4) get other people out of the room

These things help bring me back to reality when my SO occasionally triggers me.

I know that personally, my partner beating themself up about triggering me makes me not want to tell them when I have a breakdown or flashback. I want them to know that flashbacks will happen regardless of their actions - if they don’t trigger me, something else eventually will. 

And as for how to help her become more comfortable, let her know that you’re open to talk whenever she is ready to. No matter how ugly the story may be. I haven’t opened up to my partner yet, but for now they know my triggers and have a “toolkit” for when I do break down and that has worked well for us.

For most of us who witness trauma, there is no forgetting. The memories may fade with time, but they’ll still be there. (Which, I promise, is not as scary as it may sound.) The goal is to learn how to feel content, secure, and whole despite the memories.

ptsd,fo6k03x,t3_g5xbep,1587560708.0,"I can’t say exactly what causes the nightmares, but to me this sounds like Stockholm Syndrome.

It’s normally associated with kidnapping, but the general concept is that the victim, as a means of coping, develops trust, positive feelings, and an emotional bond with their captor (or in this case, abuser). I went back to my abusive ex several times, even after I was cheated on. 

As for how to fix it, I’d suggest meditating before bed. Instead of picturing yourself getting back with your ex, imagine taking control back and standing to your ground. If you do that consistently before bed, potentially it will change the dreams when they come.

Not a professional, though. Hope any of that helps."
abuse,fo5qgp8,t3_g5up6j,1587532560.0,"I was also victim of child on child sexual abuse and, like you, my parents were not supportive of mental health or therapy. (My dad is an alcoholic and a veteran, drinking water is his solution to everything lol). I definitely did face a lot of skepticism since the abuse happened with another child (we were both 12-13). My advice for facing things like that and having people try to invalidate you and your problems is to solidify with yourself that you know you and your experiences are valid regardless. Children can (knowingly or not) abuse other children. And certainly know that whenever the “it could’ve been worse” bit comes up that, yes, it could’ve been. It can always be worse. But it should’ve been better because you, especially as a child, deserve better. 

As for healing, that’s complicated. Therapy is a step in the right direction, but I know that getting it can be difficult. Before I told my parents about what happened (they’ve since become more accepting and put me into therapy) I found every means of free counseling that I could. I got it through my school and also found some success with free online counseling. Of course, counsellors are not psychologists. They do what they can, but they don’t know what they don’t know, so if at all possible, get a therapist. 

And lastly, I didn’t overcome it - not yet. I’m only 17F now, the abuse ended just 4 years ago, so I guess the wounds are still a little fresh. (Also I developed ptsd, so healing is a bit more complicated.) But I’ve made progress through therapy and putting good people in my life. My SO has helped me immensely - they’ve been understanding about the abuse and done their best to help me where they can, but starting relationships in order to heal isn’t necessarily a healthy habit. I wouldn’t recommend starting one until you feel confident and in control of yourself and your situation - don’t depend on someone to give you that control.

(Side note: Healing does not mean going back to the way you were before the abuse. There is no going back. You will never be the same and that’s okay! Healing is getting to the point of peace with what happened, where it doesn’t hurt you anymore. It may still be a touchy subject, but that’s alright too!)

Do you avoid things/places that remind you of the trauma?
Have you had flashbacks for longer than a month past the incident?
Are you missing parts of your memory surrounding the trauma / did you suddenly remember it after the fact? 
Do you have intrusive thoughts about the trauma?

1) if I seem combative or vacant, then they should not touch me or push me to do anything.
2) if I seem to be panicking, not to touch me, not to say a phrase that always triggers me (which is different from person to person), and to try to remove other people from the room.
3) also, I tell them not to let me close my eyes because this makes it easier to dissociate. (For me, at least)
4) lastly, I tell them to keep me talking because it helps to ground me and remind me of where and when I am. 

I simplify this down to: 

- Don’t touch me
- Don’t say _________
- Don’t let me close my eyes 
- Keep me talking

The second friend I told went up to him and said “I know what you did,” which led to another confrontation.

I like having the control of being able to say, “I’m going to flashback now, and then I’ll be good for a little while.” I don’t believe that this is an incredibly health process, though. Mostly I self-trigger bc I’m afraid of getting better. I was 13 when I developed ptsd (and am 17 now) so I don’t really know who I am without it. 

I don’t think self-triggering is good for you, though. It keeps you in the loop of constantly breaking down and prevents healing. (In my experience, at least)."
ptsd,fn73syg,t3_fzysj5,1586712744.0,"I understand her frustration, ptsd is definitely something that a lot of people can’t simply choose to “deal” with. However, I know that my ptsd certainly does not work like this. I get triggered, breakdown, flashback, scream, and then I cool down. I don’t throw a fucking tantrum. My screaming is in fear and beyond my control, it isn’t directed at strangers, telling them that I’ve gone through too much for them to treat me whatever way they are. 

I’ll admit that everyone experiences ptsd differently and maybe this is a side of it I just haven’t been exposed to. Somehow, though, that possibility seems unlikely to me."
ptsd,fn53msl,t3_fzn3nv,1586655137.0,"Some flashbacks and triggers are internal, not external. Internal flashbacks involve re-experiencing feelings that you felt while the traumatic event was happening. (If there was more than one event and your anxiety draws from many of them, consider also posting this to r/CPTSD.) These feelings may be of fear, lack of control, etc. Definitely bring it up to your counselor and consider taking an online screening test for ptsd. (Not like a buzzfeed one, make sure the source is credible.) The test might point you in the right direction, but can not diagnose you. 

Regardless of what you have, take care of yourself. Times are hard, make sure your needs are met before worrying about others. Stay strong."
ptsd,fn1i3py,t3_fyphuu,1586562480.0,"Our society in general loves to use victims as comedy, I’ve noticed this too. On several occasions I’ve been made fun of for flinching at everything, once having a girl go as far as to say “you shouldn’t flinch like that, people will think you have ptsd or something.” (To which i gladly informed her that I’d lived with it for three years :) )"
ptsd,fn0g3q4,t3_fyipio,1586541301.0,"I do think trauma has affected my memory, which I think is part of what you’re asking. My trauma (which occurred over 1.5 years) happened in middle school and I can’t remember much if anything from that time period. I don’t remember much of elementary, either, but I think that’s normal. Most of what I remember from middle school was the trauma (which was abuse). Those memories are vivid and I remember what I saw and felt, and occasionally heard. All of my other memories from this time are vague, like kind of hazy. It’s like I know that the event happened, but I can’t put myself back there in the moment. 

To summarize, I remember pretty much only the traumatic events from 6-8th grade and everything else is gone. Now that I’ve been removed from the abusive situation, my memory seems to be healing and I can remember recent things vividly. 

Hope that helps!"

ptsd,fmikw91,t3_fvigm3,1586111618.0,"Yes, this is sexual assault. Even if you hadn’t said no, you can’t get consent from someone who isn’t fully conscious.

Your new romantic interest doesn’t necessarily have to listen to what you say about this and if they don’t want to listen, then respect that, BUT your romantic partner SHOULD want to listen.

ptsd,fmi73ov,t1_fmgl59b,1586103762.0,"Yeah, that sounds like flashbacks. Generally ptsd is diagnosable when ptsd symptoms (hyper vigilance, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, avoiding certain places, etc.) persist for longer than a month. I’d see a therapist if you aren’t already. (Psychiatrist can prescribe drugs, psychologist can’t. Counselors are good, too, but not always we’ll versed with ptsd.) 

Be prepared for them to tell you that this isn’t ptsd, though. I don’t know many details about what you’re going through or the timeline of it, so all I can’t tell you accurately if it’s ptsd. Those are definitely flashbacks, though, so look into it. Online screening tests can be useful, but see a professional."
ptsd,fmgkqn2,t3_fv2uen,1586051195.0,"My situation is very similar to yours, actually. I’ve lived with ptsd for 4 years, (sexual abuse). Often it is hard to sleep bc of being hyper vigilant. I’m not sure if this is flashbacks, though...maybe intrusive thoughts? 

I’d define flashbacks as being the feeling of being put back into a traumatic memory. This can be external (seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, etc. You might see the whole thing play out.) or internal, like you get a wash of a feeling you felt in the moment like lack of control. If either of these definitions (internal or external) describe what you’ve been experiencing, then yes, it’s probably a flashback."

abuse,fmcvapm,t3_fu3bei,1585953544.0,"I would say that yes, this is abuse. Consent is something that people like to think of as a grey area or blurred line, but it’s really much more cut and dry than that.

The only acceptable form of consent is consent that is not pressured, freely given, given when sober, etc. What you experienced is called coerced consent, which is not a valid form of consent. You don’t have to say no."

ptsd,fm6kiiz,t3_fte50n,1585796166.0,"I think the most help I can offer you is this...

PTSD is caused by a traumatic event or several traumatic events most commonly involving some sort of harm coming to the victim or someone/something they witness. Often this involves a lack of control. Even though this doesn’t sound like PTSD to me, I have absolutely seen over the years that’s no one experiences it exactly the same way. PTSD is the brain’s way of attempting to process memories that were filed incorrectly. (Think of it like a computer malfunctioning bc it can’t read a corrupted file.) 

I definitely think you should seek professional help and perhaps look into paranoia. (The adamant/irrational belief that something/some harm will occur.) 

Again, I’m no therapist. I can’t say for sure what this is. Seek professional opinion."
ptsd,fm6jl74,t3_fs9xwj,1585795544.0,"I do occasionally intentionally trigger myself. I’ve always called it “the pull” which is my own inane bullshit lol. I guess for me it isn’t that I want to feel the pain or am “addicted to misery” as you put it, but that when I flashback I have something to grasp, you know? It’s not good, it’s not fun, it’s not masochistic, but it’s consistent. If I can rely on nothing else, I can have control of my mental state, albeit not in a positive way.

I think sometimes I’m scared to be cured because I’ll miss the consistency or that I don’t know who I am without this disorder. As for whether what you described is a flashback, I’m not sure. Consider that some triggers are internal, not external. Just a feeling. A lack of control. It’s possible that you’re flashing back/re-experiencing a feeling without dissociating (losing a sense of reality). Not all episodes are dissociative ones. Definitely seek help, though, I’m unfortunately not a professional."
ptsd,fm6h1p5,t3_fswxsu,1585793884.0,"I’m NOT a professional, but the general consensus is that if PTSD symptoms persist consistently for longer than a month, then it is PTSD.

ptsd,fm6g3rn,t3_ft5kxh,1585793284.0,"Yes, this is absolutely sexual assault. It’s also important to note that (in delaware, at least, and I imagine many other states) children 12 or younger are not legally able to consent. (There are certain exceptions, but your situation is not one.) This all boils down to that if there was any sexual contact, (which there was) it was assault."
ptsd,fm6dufz,t3_fsylzy,1585791875.0,"The short answer is yes, it is possible you have PTSD and that the environment triggered something. There are a few things, though, that I think might help your understanding. 

First, there are multiple types of PTSD, I’ll get into that later. 
Second, PTSD is caused by one or many traumas (this will affect the type), can occur at any age, and symptoms may not appear until months or even years after the trauma. 
Third, PTSD triggers can be categorized into two groups: internal and external. For you it seems like they were internal, again, more on that later.
Fourth, not everyone’s PTSD is the same and it CAN become permanent. Don’t take this to mean that you’re hopeless, there is absolutely hope for you to be cured or at least improve your condition. 

Okay, now that those are out of the way...

PTSD is diagnosable by a professional, and I am not a professional. Online screening tests are fairly accurate, though, and I highly recommend you take one and BE HONEST. This may not be PTSD or maybe it is. Either way, talk to a professional! 
I’m not sure about what symptoms you’re showing exactly (I’m not in your head lol), but consider whether it was a physical sensation (seeing something, a smell, maybe a song?) that triggered your flashback/panic or a general internal feeling, maybe of lack of control. If it is physical, it’s an external trigger. If it’s a feeling, it’s internal. 
Now about the types. I think you might want to look into complex PTSD (CPTSD). Think about what happens to you when you are triggered. Is it related to one event in specific? Or does it draw from pieces of many events? If it draws from many, consider looking into CPTSD. There is a sub reddit for it. 
Regular PTSD will deal mostly with one traumatic event (i.e. a car crash) while Complex deals with many (years of abuse, neglect, war, etc.). Even people that experienced many traumatic events (like someone who was abused) may only draw triggers from one specific event, so don’t rule it out! 
Lastly, I strongly urge you to seek help. Yes, it is possible for PTSD to resolve itself, but this isn’t exactly common. If left untreated for several years, it may become permanent, though treatment will still help. Support groups, talk therapy, and medicinal therapy (such as medical marijuana) can be helpful in treating this disorder. If one type of treatment doesn’t work for you to manage symptoms, ask a specialist about trying another. For example, I don’t take any drugs to manage symptoms, but for some people it works. Some people need a combination of treatments. Whatever works for you!

I hope this helps you and please, know that you are loved and if you look for support you will find it. Good luck!"
