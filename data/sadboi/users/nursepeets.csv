relationship_advice,f8uuo48,t3_e21a8x,1574845138.0,"My fiance have always bought me things and i'm almost spoiled for that matter.. but i never demanded anything for a ring. Although i could remember when he gave me hints when he would ask me what cut or style would i want as an engagement ring. All I wanted was a simple one and he gave me just that. Still, it depends on her preference but as for me, as long as I get married to the ""one"" then i'm happy..üòÅ"
relationship_advice,f8aux5w,t1_f8aucis,1574413219.0,"That gave me tears. I love him so much. Beyond words. Perhaps i just had this idea of him being the perfect man and when reality showed me that he's just as imperfect as me, i felt cheated. I felt like a victim that he never told me about this side of him.i felt stupid. I felt blind. it's almost a year now yet i still.feel the pain..i'm trying my hardest not to be perfect for him but to be a better version of myself.. to not get it the best of me. Thank you so much..i needed that"

depression,f45mvcq,t3_dj76uo,1571384520.0,Almost feels like when im happy then it's too good to be true.
depression,f4059ta,t1_f3yw1br,1571285515.0,I'm so sorry about your bestfriend. Hey you don't deserve those kind of people who turn you down when you need them.
depression,f3y9qur,t1_f3y9fai,1571250738.0,I'm sorry to hear that. I wish things would be better for you. And always pray..
depression,f3t93wn,t3_di0bz2,1571123240.0,When i'm sad.. i sit next to my dogs. I hug them i pet them i kiss them and pinch their cheeks. I boop their cute noses. My dogs give me quite a stare when im crying. I feel like they can sense it when we're sad.. i love my dogs too much that i dont want to think that someday they'd be gone.. i equally love all of them. I miss them just by typing this message. It's amazing how a dog can make you feel a hundred times better wthout any words.
depression,f3p04q7,t3_dck8hr,1571036132.0,"But that's how we dream our dreams.if that makes sense.
That's how we remind ourselves that 'this isn't it"", ""i could be happier"" "" i deserve better"".
I feel that way too. Way more than i should. But the sadness i feel when i snap out of daydreaming jst reminds me where i wanna get from here.. it's hard. It really is.. and i've learned not to expect anything from people,no matter how they promise to help you.. we should learn to pick up ourselves in the first place. Only WE can fight our real fights.. you are not alone.. in God's time, we'll get there.."
depression,f3ozr29,t3_del3c8,1571035593.0,"I just had this situation recently. I decided to quit a job cause it's getting me depressed.it was toxic. 
My parents think im just being a wuss or perhaps lazy. I've been crying really hard at night since then. I had to support myself jobless, otherwise theyd just tell me I TOLD YOU SO. i dont know.. it really hurts cause.sometimes when.im at home i feel like my mom's pissed at me. I have other dreams but situations have not been favorable to me. I just pray. I pray really hard. Lately it feels like only God can understand me. I even stopped talking to friends. Although some of them have somehow talked me out of my depression, at the end of the day, my sadness would start creeping in when im alone. Im jobless, and im feeling insecure and i feel like im an excess baggage.. lot of times i doubt myself, was i selfish? Was i wrong for leaving? Sometimes i regret leaving but only because im no longer earning..
But the job was slowly killing me in ways my family couldnt fathom.. until now i get bouts of sadness.. when i feel giddy and happy my mind suddenly says YAH YOU'RE HAPPY NOW BUT YOU'RE BROKE. YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD. still fighting my demons but i know God wouldnt allow all of this to happen if it wont make us stronger. You are not alone. Just please know that you are not alone.."
depression,f3oze17,t3_dhcrf5,1571035074.0,"I am depressed too.. but hey let's help.each other.. think about how your family would feel if you'd take your own life. Many people struggle and spend so much just to live one more day. I know it's bad.i know it's sad..but hey it's still LIFE. we're all gonna die anyway, might as well try to live it while we can. Don't put your family in a very confusing and excruciating situation when you decide to take your own life. A lot of us are depressed, we have a community here and funny enough, we understand each other way more than our significant ohers do.. we can make it.. this too shall pass.."
depression,f3oz0y1,t3_dhm2t8,1571034572.0,"I get that too. Sometimes even as i wake up my heart pounds from all the anxiety then i get depressed again. What works for me though is that i say a little prayer every moring, do some stretches and eat on time. I find that when i skip meals i tend to get depressed again easily. Also i get on with my day, take a shower.. play with my dogs- works everytime.
At night I read some self help books and do a journal."
Unemployed,f3lx9za,t1_f3lvisi,1570980461.0,"I feel an immense relief knowing someone understands me. People just say you've got a well paying/stable job ( i used to work in a govt hospital) but they don't really see how it's killing you. With lots of prayers and hard work, we will surpass this. It's not worth staying in a toxic place. I agree, perhaps we need a break. Try to see what we really want.."
Unemployed,f3kg3sd,t1_f3k4c7k,1570965319.0,"Thank you so much.. i still love being a nurse though.
Here in ph there's not much fair opportunities for nurses.planning to work in Uk"
