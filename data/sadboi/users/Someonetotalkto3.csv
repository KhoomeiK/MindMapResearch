For me it’s mental illness for a long time I felt no purpose and I am also extremely introverted and that caused me to hide my illness and refuse to get treatment. Helping people through these forums is just as beneficial or even more than the people you mentioned because there is no shortage of them, but there a plenty of people who do not get treatment and seek help online. There could be someone with the same problems you used to have and overcame and you could help them and find someone who overcame troubles that you currently are having a hard time with and seek help from them. People sharing experiences as knowledge is some of the best medicine out there"

I was hiding it my whole life from my family and no one knew about my attempt except my future wife. I’m so thankful she had gotten there where she did because after opening up the struggles I go through now that I told my loved ones I know I’ll have them. That was the hardest part for me because i would think my brothers would think it’s weakness, but I found that true strength it’s confronting overcoming. I don’t know what lies ahead of me I have been hiding it so only been to therapist in secret for a few visits and quit. But the hurdle of telling them will make it easier to ask for help when I need it."
