gameofthrones,fpd2dom,t3_gbdno8,1588518370.0,"I cried when Theon died. He had the best arc of the show in my opinion. He started out a “loyal” hostage who only flipped when his father told him he was not a Greyjoy. 

I hated him and during his captivity and torture I felt for him, but felt he deserved it. 

His PTSD made me sad and his helping sansa escape made me like him a little. He risked his life helping her escape, then when they were caught he went out into the open to be captured and tortured again to help sansa get away safe. He chooses to go home. 

Although he jumps overboard when Yara is captured, he ultimately gets beaten up to go find her and save her from Euron. She forces “Theon” to come out instead of still being “Reek” when he is scared. Yara is his queen and he will do whatever she commands, but when he wants to fight for winterfell he was given leave to do so. 

He comes back and fights for Bran, the one he tried to kill. The scene where he is talking to Bran right before he charges at the night king is what made me cry. Theon believed the things he did would never be forgiven and he would die without ever being forgiven for the things he did. 

Him crying when Bran told him he was a good man is what did it. He was forgiven and died for the one he tried to kill. 

Watching his death gives me goosebumps every time."
