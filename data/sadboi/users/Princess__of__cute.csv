She didn't answer at all and then I blocked her, because I really couldn't keep up hope that she would answer any of my messages. She now realized that first in January, even thought I blocked her in October. That already shows how important I am to her. So she realized that I blocked her, but she just came back at me a couple of weeks ago. When she then wrote me, she just was mad that I blocked her, but like, it's now April and I did that in October.

I really wanted to talk about the whole situation but as you can see, if I had tried to ask, she wouldn't have answered anyway. The only thing left to do, was waiting till she would like to talk. If she hadn't said anything, that would have been fine. It would have meant that we just grew apart. She was just mad and didn't try to talk. Called me childish even thought everything she could do was telling me afterwards, that I need to shut up.

I have read these words. She wrote all this, this is nothing I thought she would say, she really said I should stop talking after trying to make her understand. Believe me, if she had tried to solve the problem, I would have listened to her, but she didn't want to
