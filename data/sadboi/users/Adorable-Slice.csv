>it‚Äôs sounds like you have a strong sense of self, and are listening closely to what your ‚Äúinner compass‚Äù is pointing you toward. i commend you for that. it takes a lot of hard work to get to that place.

Also thank you for noting this. It really has been a lot of work for me to be able to begin to hear my honest to god truths under all the noise of my family or general society's expectations for me. I always feel like I am focusing on what I am trying to make happen and I rarely am able to see the progress I have made.

Like, I'm not saying I know anything for certain. We are just doing what feels like is what we wanna do right now. I feel like maybe I broke free of something tonight. I was so scared of the reaction he was going to have and that it would influence my own resolve about who I am and what I want. But he reacted that way, and I made a choice to see him for what he was: afraid of me ever feeling any pain or discomfort. I know this can't be controlled. What will happen will happen. It's ok if things change. It's okay not to know.

He had this reaction and I was able to not let it knock me all the way over. I cried. I let myself just acknowledge that his worries are his. His fears don't influence my truth. I'm very creative at solving problems and coping with the shit the world throws me. I understand there's no avoiding pain.

I can say from experience that it will only allow itself to be subdued for so long until it makes you act out in some way. It can manifest in behavior that has nothing to do with queerness, but might be a very convoluted path towards some kind of proxy validation."
latebloomerlesbians,fqisaqx,t3_gj1d4r,1589400196.0,"I am going to tell you a part of my story. I am not saying this is your story or that I know what's happening for you or that you're not bi, because bi people exist, of course! 

However, since I really was not able to divorce myself from the ""expectation"" of the het life placed in my head by society, as I got older I became slowly more and more disconnected from my body and all the genuine feelings that did not result in the ""het happy life vision"". 

I wish that I had been able to accept that there was a conflict of interest for me. I ""logically"" wanted that het life because it was what I was told would make me happy ever since I was very young. I had already faced some severe backlash for being ""like a boy"" in my gradeschool and middle school years. I knew the price of being different was crushing loneliness. Since I was not out as bi, my concept of what queer women were was informed only by media portrayals. I was afraid they would not be like me either, or accept me, or maybe I wouldn't have anything in common with them either, therefore they would be incapable of building the life I wanted, and I would never find happiness. I am GNC but I was not out as that either, and I dressed exceptionally feminine and ""liked it"". I liked it because it objectively looked good, but not because it spoke to who I was. I probably liked it because it did not speak to who I was. 

The scene you painted is sort of where I was for years. I got married and all that and I do love my husband, but I also finally realized I was a lesbian and not bi like I thought. I kicked the can down the road til I got married and even though I did NOT want to accept this reality because I had already chosen a path (I'm married to a man!) I didn't want to have to do all this work again getting to know a person etc.  I really WANTED to be bi, and I felt like I couldn't quite parse how I was feeling about women, but that was because I didn't really want to face the reality of how my life would change or how my life might look if I really let myself be myself. 

It creates a real dilemma of the very real love I feel for my husband and the very real reality that I've found ways to 'enjoy' het sex because I figured out a way to pull entirely into my body, rather than be grounded during it, which is actually not healthy to do because it's a form of dissociation. I do it with so much of my life none of that felt weird to me. I am dealing with this all now, and I really, really wish I gave a serious relationship with a woman a chance because even if it didn't work out, I think I would have known, like I know now, that I am a lesbian. 

I think you want to know. There is only one way to find out, and it's to take some time to yourself and not latch yourself to a guy for a bit. See how you feel and what you want. You're not doing your partner any favors sugar coating your confusion about what you want and need to explore WITHOUT him. It's not for him and it has nothing to do with him. It's about you and what you need to understand for sure about yourself. No one can answer those questions for you. I can tell you I spent many years googling answers to questions like the ones you ask. There is only one way to figure out who your authentic self is. You have to have experiences and really be in your BODY feelings. You have to take off every mask you wear, every piece of ""identity"" you attach to yourself as ""fact"", and start to consider the validity of even the most ""obvious"" of them.  It's very hard to locate what a feeling of real joy is for me because I allowed for so long for people to tell me WHAT makes me happy and I don't have a lot of experience figuring out for myself how I feel. I always wanted to be told what to do, and told if how I felt ""made sense"". You can't look to other people to answer questions about what you should do and who you are because you are the authority on you. No one can understand you better than you can understand you, but it takes hard work and lots of stillness and tears. Letting go of expectations is very hard. It's been hard for me to let go of the little fairy tales society has brainwashed me with in order to try to make room for the hopes and dreams that are customized and designed by me alone.

Meditate. Spend time in quiet stillness with yourself. See what comes up for you. Take note of where you feel things in your body when you have an emotion. Start to understand that sometimes your body sends a signal to you that your mind doesn't want to hear. To reference Marie Kondo - get familiar with what the physical sensation of joy feels like in your body. 

You will find the answers you need when you're ready to do that work and let go of preconceived expectations of what happiness means for yourself. I let it go too long and I got FORCED to do this because eventually I had a 'mysterious' nervous breakdown. So, just a warning, you can delay this, but it's time will come, so might as well just figure it out now. I wish I had done the work 10 years ago."

I feel like when I realized I was gay I suddenly felt like I wasn't such an angry person. But then, when I got scared and started to get confused, I started getting angry and unhappy.
I realized I believe the breakdowns were about that I keep forcing myself in directions that are not my purpose, or at least, not taking the turn on the road when it's time. 

I have noticed my mental health suffers when I doubt the validity of that I am gay, and I feel good when I just KNOW that I am gay and it's fine.

Some part of me fights back when I try to push this away. A part that says it won't be silenced anymore. I keep not listening to it. I'm proud I'm so strong that I'm breaking free of it. The mental illness is actually the warning bells that I'm not being true to myself. In a way, I owe my mental illness an apology because it was just doing its job and I didn't know how to listen and understand that lying about myself to myself is what was making me crazy.

My authentic self is trapped in the well, my mental illness is Lassie, and I wasn't even asking, ""What it is, girl? What's wrong?""

latebloomerlesbians,fqb9i3e,t1_fqaxxm1,1589232936.0,"Yes! Like the affection comes first and if I was having any sexual feelings at all before I was able to see it, they were not something I was able to recognize as such. I think this is something that's been SURPRISING me. Like, in the context of having a relationship with a girl, I find myself surprised at my sexual response. I still won't NOTICE I am feeling something til it's really dramatically obvious to me. Sometimes I feel like I try to force it because THAT is my sexual experience being with men, like SEARCHING REALLY HARD FOR ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE MAYBE what it was SUPPOSED TO BE.  
I'll think like, ""I think I'm SUPPOSED to be feeling xyz right now and am I?  I don't think...?"" Then I will relax and stop trying to find it and just chill out.  I realize when I get grounded with a woman, it happens without me thinking about it at all. Trying to break this anxiety to LOCATE arousal has been tough for me because it's how I found a way to be sexual with men, so I conflate it with sex.   
I don't have to put all this work into finding arousal with women, and in this ass backwards way, THAT HABIT sometimes trips me up in a romantic scenario. I will want to BE the sexual being they seem to want right now, and unknowingly fall into this habit of performance which actually TAKES AWAY from my ability to be in the moment and have a genuine response."

I keep wishing I heard someone tell me that if I PINED over how much happier I'd be if I could be living with my best friend, and that if the reason I gave myself for why that'd be hopeless is because that's not what straight women do... hmmm well maybe I am really very gay. :P  


There is just so much focus, at least in my mind, on that one must feel a type of lustful objectification of women to be attracted to them because that is the MODEL of attraction the media presents as men's experience with female attraction. 

HOWEVER, even my husband says that was NOT his experience of attraction to me. He felt more like he was just happier around me and he didn't even really know WHY exactly. He just felt the way he felt. 

That experience is actually what I felt towards various girls my whole life. I didn't know that was love."
latebloomerlesbians,fqarlhn,t1_fq9till,1589224073.0,"Yes to that ""I can't see myself with one"". That was all society's message, not my own.   
When I am with a girl, I have these in and out moments. Moments where it's like I forgot about my presumed ""identity"" and instead find myself entirely genuinely in the moment with her, acting totally authentic to my grounded authentic self, but I can't seem to hold it.   
If I become aware of it, it can toss me right out of it.  I feel kind of ... perverted about how I feel towards her. Something about it feels like I am being ""wrong"" or ""ridiculous"" or that my feelings towards women is probably related to the oversexualization of women in media and I don't ""really"" feel this way. Logically I know this makes no sense.  
The effect oversexualization of women in media has on women isn't that it makes them think they are gay. It makes women feel like they have to behave a certain way to be seen as valuable. ALSO I NEVER LIKED the oversexualization of women in media! It makes ME uncomfortable to see women objectified, and I am not really attracted to the narrative of the toxic male gaze. 

I find myself suddenly emotionally disconnected and that disconnection will make me question if I am a ""faker"". I know logically that I am actually just experiencing a lot of trouble staying grounded against a conditioning that was SO FAR OUTSIDE of my truth.   
The idea of ""I am gay"" is not what my upbringing was teaching me I am.   
I am a big fan of The Holistic Psychologist. I get texts from her and one recently said, ""You are more powerful than the story you've been told about who you are."" I keep trying to play this sentence in my mind so I can beat this. 

I feel shame about that too. I will feel like - wow ok I guess my life is one where I will always feel deeply lonely, because I am gay, but look how I can't stay grounded in it? I feel like my girl deserves someone who is reliably able to be fully IN it with her. She says it's ok and she doesn't blame me and understands. I know I need to not think FOR her. I've been on the other side, where someone was thinking for me and it's really frustrating when someone has no self compassion or hope they will improve their issues in time if they just practice some self compassion...  


""Seeing more and more good examples of lesbian couples as I've gotten older and consumed different media has really opened my eyes."" -- I think this makes a lot of sense because it creates a MODEL to base the experience off of that feels genuine.

Not a lot of examples of beautiful women who have calm stable romantic love."
latebloomerlesbians,fqaovn7,t1_fq9kaow,1589222736.0,"OMG this is funny to me you say this because I realized that the reason I was SO INTIMIDATED by the influence of other women when it came to my male partners was because I WAS SO ATTRACTED to women. I was projecting. haha

That whole line of logic makes no sense, and made no sense to me until I realized it was my stuff being projected onto him. >\_>   


Then I realized, I was not actually jealous. I REALLY liked them. I was attracted to them and it confused me.

LesbianActually,fq8tz6g,t1_fq4iifx,1589175465.0,"Yeah when you look back, it's like... Literally how did I not immediately connect these thoughts with ""this is... REALLY incredibly gay to be thinking about."" 

Also, I would do and say things that in hindsight I'm actually surprised I got away with doing and without any eyebrow raising. I cannot tell you the degree I flirted with girls, fawned over them, praised them, gifted things to them, wrote them literally love letters singing all their praises, as well as publically wrote LJ posts lamenting the betrayal when they hurt me the way someone would their ex.

It's INSANE how invisible queer women are that I was doing what I was doing and no one was like, ""Dude. That's SUPER GAY."" 

Because, it was SUPER gay. üòÇ"
LesbianActually,fq8t0bm,t1_fq3izpc,1589174681.0,"Aw thank you! Feels nice to be welcomed. Lol
Yeah I feel really silly for ever having been confused about it. I keep saying that I was REALLY gay the whole time, I just assumed ""I must be attracted to men because people have been telling me my whole life that I am.""

I just really struggled to let go of the idea that everyone was wrong. That they thought they knew things about me that they had no way to know I'd be. Like, if someone grew up being told that based on their gender, one day they would get a pool, that would be like, inscribed into your head to be expecting to get a pool ""one day"". Whether you liked the idea or not. I did not put the idea in my head that I was attracted to men. Other people did by assuming one day I'd have a husband, and it really fucked me up! Haha I was pointed in the wrong direction. üòÇ"
LesbianActually,fq8saff,t1_fq3lx0g,1589174106.0,"I would love to entertain that idea, but I know I definitely wasn't even a little bit. I just REALLY was trying to figure out how I was ""supposed"" to feel about them and wondering ""is this it? I think maybe this is it?"" And never really being sure. (Which I now realize is a surefire sign of you def are not feeling attraction if you are NOT SURE if you're feeling it.)

It's like the equivalent to a kid taking a sip of beer and acting ridiculous because they are expecting to be drunk. When they finally experience what drunk really is they would think, ""I wasn't drunk before, I was just a fool!""

I recognized my ignorance's affect on what I thought was supposed to be happening. 
It's like laughing at a joke that you only partially get, but you don't KNOW you are missing the BIGGER punchline. Once you get the joke, you're going to register a much more dramatic feeling."

Thank you for sharing this. 

I always wonder about stuff like that even like... Maybe they were into me but not really? Or I don't know. Maybe I was encouraging that behavior because I'm just really fucking gay and it's fun to do with me? Hah

There's this thing that happens when one is in love where one feels like the other person MUST feel it too. It feels like connection so it's like YOU MUST FEEL THIS?

But it really just comes from oneself, and we are lucky when someone else is having that experience too. 

There's this Paul Simon song where he says, ""You don't feel you could love me, but I feel you could.""

That feeling is a BITCH."

I have three therapists (one is my couples therapist) and they have all be extremely supportive of our choice for consensual non-monagamy. My husband isn't actually interested in seeing anyone else and is avoidantly attached. He says it's nice for him to have some pressure taken off. Haha"

It's complicated when you have a wonderful best friend for a husband and you realize you are gay. I think it's perfectly acceptable to not want to toss out your marriage when it's a good influence on your life and he's supportive of who you are. 
I keep feeling like people will want to TELL ME I'm bi, but I'm not bi! I would probably not ever be in a poly dynamic at all if I was bi. I need to try this arrangement to be okay because I'm GAY. haha

Also, I have sex with my husband and he's good at it and it's pleasurable for me. But it's ... Like you said, closer to masturbation than what I feel like I have with a girl. My motivation for doing it with him is as you described. It's not sexual attraction, it's a different animal. Often I decide to have sex with him because I just randomly feel horny on all on my own. I'm familiar with him and I love him very much. It's just part of what I do with him sometimes. I just think ""it is what it is"" and I know who I am. 

I know I would not have probably ever got THIS familiar with him if I opened myself to the reality that I'm a lesbian earlier in my life. However, I didn't. So this is the circumstance I'm in. 

Him and I have talked about the possibility of things may change between us as time goes by, but like, I'm just gonna do what makes me feel loved and safe. As today stands, he accepts me as gay and doesn't feel bad about letting me be gay. He's a great guy and never was thinking this was a threesome thing. Shit has been hard enough and he's been there for me and I trust him. I like living with him. I love his hugs. He's a loyal friend and my most steadfast one. That's why I married him and that's all still true."

latebloomerlesbians,fpxyqtg,t1_fpx6qj3,1588992347.0,"The thing about realizing you loved your best friend is real. I realized I was in love with a few of my best friends over the years. That realization really kinda fucks with you, doesn't it? 

I suddenly felt like I was reexperiencing the feelings of unrequited love that I denied myself to feel fully each time because, ""You know that you will never be as important to them as they are to you. You know we have to go home to our boyfriends. You know that it's unreasonable to want them around the degree you do. You know you can't expect or want what you feel. You know this is not how it is."" 

And they were not SEXUAL feelings for me. They were ROMANTIC feelings. Feelings like wishing they lived with me, or daydreaming about if they did. Feelings like ""the light went out"" when they ended up not being in my life in a significant way anymore. Feeling like I had something with them I just could not ever get from my boyfriend. Feeling like I just desperately wanted to be where they were, laugh at everything they said and genuinely just LOVE them. Feeling like the world revolved around their ability to be where I was, and I'd make any adjustment, and put up whatever money was needed so they could. 

Suddenly being aware, ""oh. That was heartache"" is really hard to accept. It feels a bit embarrassing. It feels sad to recognize how deeply hopeless and undeserving I felt of having that love reciprocated by these girls. That it was so pervasive I never thought that I was gay. I never thought maybe I could make some gay friends and get a girlfriend who could reciprocate fully. 

I just thought I would always feel an empty space in my heart where the girls I loved deeply came only to visit but never to stay. I would say to myself, ""You know this is just how it is.""
Then I would daydream about wouldn't it be lovely if one day I finally met a girl who would become my best friend and who wanted to live together. Then think, ""never gonna happen.""

It's really hard to accept past heartache as much more heartbreaking than you gave it credit for. 

There's a girl whom I developed a pretty bad crush on over the years who suddenly became a lot less responsive to me after she broke up with her bf. I would cry over her and I would think to myself, ""Why are you being like this? You have no reason to be this upset. Doesn't even make sense. She is still your friend. Grow up."" 

When I accepted that it's because I'm gay and I had fallen in love with her, it made a lot more sense why I felt so so deeply devastated by a girl who was still being my friend, and still taking to me, and seems to like me same as ever, just not taking everyday anymore or for nearly as long.

Then I cried more; and it blows, because it hurts in places I don't even know how to reach. Then I had to accept that I've felt this way many other times and never allowed myself to fully grieve losing the proximity I had with them. 

Ugh. All the girls I hopelessly poured so much gay love into and really expected nothing in return at all. I just would grieve so deeply and for so long when they didn't have the same kind of time for me anymore. I couldn't even be upset with them. I couldn't feel anything but that what I wanted was for them to get what they needed and I understood I would never be more important than their romantic interests. 

It was like how in Westworld they say, ""Doesn't look like anything to me."" 
I was really clearly always gay. I just really didn't EXPECT me to me."

It's the nurse, the EMT, the grocery clerk, the mail carriers, the garbage collectors and other public service workers. 
We have to focus on the positive things this is ultimately manifesting while being present in the reality of pain right now. This is the wheel of life.
