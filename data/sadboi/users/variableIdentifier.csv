PersonalFinanceCanada,fr34u2w,t1_fr2dulr,1589849969.0,"I live a ten minute walk from the office in a small apartment where I had to set up my workspace in the corner of my living room, which is very much not ideal for working in my opinion. Your commute time thing makes a lot of sense. I planned my life around being able to walk to the office, not working from home. I think for more people to want to work from home, they'd have to know in advance they were able to do so, so that they could plan it out."
PersonalFinanceCanada,fr34cju,t1_fr21w9a,1589849687.0,"Okay, I can really relate to this. I have the exact same experience. I live in a two bedroom apartment with my roommate and I set my workspace up in the corner of the living room. He isn't working right now though so I'm the only one working while he sits around all day. At work, everyone around you is working and I find that really helps with motivation. He might start working in a few weeks but it's not guaranteed.

If I had a separate office space, I may feel differently, but as it is I feel like I'm always at work because of the fact that my workstation is in my living space. I really like having that distinct boundary between work and home life. Also, I miss my coworkers. That sucks.

I feel like more people will start working from home after all this and that's fine, but as soon as they allow me back in the office (might be six months), I am definitely going back."
