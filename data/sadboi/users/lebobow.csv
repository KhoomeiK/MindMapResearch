JustBootThings,fq1gttu,t1_fq13lvb,1589045525.0,"Thatd how the aviation side of the Army is. My OIC doesn't like me calling him sir and prefers bro. He was only a PFC  when he got picked up to be a pilot so he's chill and pilots usually just get a ""what's up"" instead of the full good morning sir routine."
TikTokCringe,fpawd6k,t1_fpatsj0,1588457083.0,I wish you were wrong. There was a post or comment somewhere on reddit that went in to detail explaining all of tik toks shady practices. I should've saved that because it even included trust worthy sources.
grilledcheese,fpaqh8a,t3_gc914k,1588453590.0,I'm originally from Delaware and wawa is the only thing I miss.
TikTokCringe,fpaq0wj,t1_fpak8z9,1588453317.0,They've got me a few times and it tricked me into downloading the app. After a day on reddit seeing numerous funny tik tok I took the leap. I uninstalled after that night but i can never get my soul back.
ThatsInsane,fpapje1,t1_fp9kv9t,1588453028.0,I remember when this happened. I used to live in Delaware just before the line to Pennsylvania and a few years before this a girl got hit by multiple cars on Route 13 in new castle.
fallout76settlements,fpan7bj,t3_gc9r2x,1588451638.0,I'm apart of the minority that doesn't mind floating camps. It's just so annoying to move the camp that it makes sense to have just the single bottom platform then build up. I don't go to other people's camps enough for it to effect me. I don't have a floating camp myself but that's only because I've moved it so many times that I've found my forever camp... I hope

shittyaquariums,foxcbdw,t1_fowl6q2,1588139748.0,"This is exactly why I follow a bunch of aquarium sub reddits. I don't currently have any fish but when I get some I want to keep them correctly. Its just so easy to get the knowledge to do it correctly that I don't understand how people can still be fucked up.

Edit: spelling"
oldpeoplefacebook,fop9m0o,t3_g8h8nk,1587956167.0,I didn't see anybody else mention it but this is a fake account. A guy from a troll group I'm in made it for fun.  It's a pretty funny account to follow on Facebook though.
fo76,fol0p6u,t1_fokhs79,1587852587.0, I'm on xbox and I'd kill for some screws.
shittyaquariums,fo62e1r,t1_fo601wi,1587543941.0,Okay I'll definitely keep that in mind. It honestly never would have crossed my mind. I don't plan on getting an aquarium for a few more years so I have plenty of time to learn. Thanks a lot for the info.
shittyaquariums,fo5zal8,t1_fo4pstk,1587540724.0,I don't have any fish and I'm just in various subs like this to learn so why don't you rinse the gravel?
MovieDetails,fn2kk1m,t1_fmz1tru,1586592437.0,Then I'll call myself a freak as well. I generally really really like sequels because I already know and care about the characters. I already know the world so anything onward is just a bonus for me to spend more time in that world or with those characters.
insanepeoplefacebook,fn0akbl,t1_fmwdyad,1586538417.0,Sorry for the late reply but yes I am and I absolutely love it. I just wish they'd settle down with the GOBLESS before it blows everyone's cover.

modernwarfare,fmro9vw,t1_fmro0jv,1586329541.0,That's why I had to get a wired connection. Running on wifi was almost useless. When I play now or try to download something I make sure nothing else in the house is connected. That's the only way I can get all the way up to 7mbps. If other stuff is connected I get a range from x-kbps to 3mbps.
modernwarfare,fmrnqko,t1_fmrna9d,1586329027.0,Shits rough. I'm moving soon so I'm hoping I can get better internet there.
modernwarfare,fmrnaxu,t1_fmrn3l7,1586328612.0,I'm not trying to downplay everybody's issues but I can never read comments like this without getting sad. When I buy a new game it usually takes a day or two to download and it kills that new game excitement.
modernwarfare,fmrmu49,t1_fmrm16e,1586328173.0,I'd kill for those speeds. I'm in central Kansas and pay for the best wifi and I get roughly 7Mbps on a good day with a wired connection.
modernwarfare,fmrmd6d,t1_fmrjgsq,1586327730.0,The only time it bothers me is on small maps when I call in a kill streak on the enemy spawn only to have the spawns flip. I take like 5 deaths for one cluster strike.
modernwarfare,fmo4ipx,t1_fmnkgip,1586245100.0,This is the main thing that grinds my gears while playing and will normally make me quit playing domination for the night. I hate playing domination or headquarters and my team not playing the objective. I understand trying to get kills but if you actually attack/defend the points you'll get a good amount of kills.
shittyaquariums,fmm55nc,t3_fw0yvi,1586198982.0,I'm just glad I found this sub. I don't have any fish but i was looking through a bunch of aquarium/fish subs to learn so I could start my first aquarium and before this sub I wouldn't have thought this tank was bad.
horror,fmkf7m6,t1_fmkf1l3,1586152939.0,That's probably the perfect way to put it. If you're not expecting some crazy amazing twist I think the movie is great.
horror,fmkexbo,t1_fmkdk65,1586152672.0,"I think that's fair but ""twist"" definitely seems to be the wrong word. I really don't wanna sound like I hated the movie because I definitely liked it. I just feel like the wrong buzz words have been associated with it."
modernwarfare,fmk496d,t1_fmk1lkx,1586144170.0,"I'd be extra pissed becuase I really don't like the shotguns in the first place. I'm also lagging way worse then usual and I was wondering if anybody was having that problem.

Edit: to add the bit about lag"
modernwarfare,fmk1cka,t1_fmk0ip6,1586142205.0,Same. I'm working on my SMG's right now and I was pretty close on the Aug (least favorite smg) and now i'm just playing bots since it doesn't matter anyway.
modernwarfare,fmjujh0,t3_fvpybw,1586138038.0,I just came on here to see if anybody else was having this issue. I just played probably 6 matches with my brother and we just noticed that we haven't earned any xp. The kills aren't even counting towards weapon skins.
horror,fmjp8nr,t1_fmjac3q,1586134906.0,I literally just finished watching it and I'm not sure where any twist was. I thought the entire movie was transparent. I still watched the whole movie and I enjoyed it enough but I agree with criticism that it was very by the book.
Fallout,fmdcz7u,t1_fmd0mj8,1585964744.0,Im actually trying to get into it. I hate it but I just replayed New Vegas and 4 and I really want more fallout.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fm0nsbu,t1_fm0g5dv,1585662445.0,I'm pretty sure you're right. It looks like it has a little bucket that dumped them out. I was wondering if after a few times they'd realize it wasn't going to hurt them.

dogs,fk9y6lc,t1_fk7naok,1583986582.0,I'd be worried about this. I was away from home for a month and my wife took my old man to the vet because he wasn't feeling well. The vet said she should put him down immediately because he wouldn't make it more than a couple days and would suffer. After a few days he was back to normal and that vet visit was almost 4 years ago. He spends his days happily playing with our young shepherd and napping.
dogs,fim2rlj,t3_f86egb,1582516592.0,When we got my dog at 5 his name was Johnny T.K and now that he's a 13yr old man with a grey goatee I just call him John.

CasualConversation,exzdk80,t1_exvtzrl,1566664409.0,"Congratulations on finishing your first 5k! It really is a big accomplishment. I know its difficult to carry the weight but running is all about technique and mental strength. It seems like you definitely have the right attitude and I think you could become a really good runner if you work on your technique. I'm about 5'5"" and 200lbs. I've been in the Army for about 4 years and have to run all the time. Getting the proper technique made my runs significantly easier and less stressful."

AskReddit,erwjfcd,t1_erw2sj6,1561345440.0,"Something similar happened to me when I was younger. I had a really bad family life and moved out of my dads when I was 13. I moved in with a friend of mine but he got really weird when I started dating my first girlfriend. He got super jealous and always asked if I told her about him. Long story short, they left for vacation while I was gone and locked the doors with my stuff outside. I had to ride my longboard 17 miles to my dads house who I hadn't talked to in about a year and ask to move back in. He lived in the middle of a corn field in a run down single wide with no flooring. Just plywood. The girl came over to visit me because I was upset about the whole thing and then broke up with me because I was ""trailer trash and would probably never be more then that.""
