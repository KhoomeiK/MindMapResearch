EpicGamesPC,fr3emdh,t3_gm75k5,1589855755.0,Just saw an ad saying it was free. Yup it’s free
PublicFreakout,fo9rzok,t3_g69sul,1587629086.0,All of those protestors are disgusting. Just listening to the video was painful. The police were enforcing public health safety at the park and now they show up at his house inflating their egos?
memes,fmddpap,t1_fmcjwv0,1585965246.0,Sbeve
technology,fll9s4q,t3_fpcgpc,1585256243.0,What kind of data are they sending?
gifs,fl2s6oq,t3_fm3zt4,1584758539.0,Dam these things can fly?
worldnews,fkzwg5l,t3_flildi,1584682532.0,If they close they are going to go out of business for sure
WayOfTheBern,fkvlmv6,t3_fkq6ew,1584571737.0,I’m totally for Biden over trump but there have been multiple times where Biden seems incoherent. Is he in good health for presidency?
news,fktj9ea,t3_fkcbz3,1584522352.0,Paper checks seem like a bad idea. Increase bank traffic when there is a 10 person gathering limit? What about theft of the check from your mailbox?
LifeAdvice,fix8k1j,t1_fiwulxk,1582815179.0,In the beginning I thought it was a bad thing to want to kill yourself. But my life plan as of now is to jump ship when I turn 24.  Do you get suicidal urges often?
politics,ficj8cq,t3_f7hx3z,1582348904.0,So they are going to invalidate bernies potential win (possibly only his) due to Russia interfering? Hmm
nextfuckinglevel,fi2p9rl,t3_f5wa9c,1582085274.0,Did he put some of his blood in there in the beginning??
Dentistry,fggj7x6,t1_fggj3nj,1580762999.0,Thx for the reply that makes me feel a lot better. :)
Dentistry,fg84ill,t1_fg77uel,1580609323.0,2.5 centimeters.  am I screwed?
borderlands3,ffao97h,t3_erk65r,1579740608.0,playing as a  level 42 Zane and i'm having a lot of trouble killing/ staying alive in mayhem 1 mode. do I just suck or is there something i'm not doing right? im running hitman and double agent with most of my points in hitman.
depression,fex2ixe,t1_fewwn88,1579423241.0,“Are the peaks worth it?” My thoughts on my depression exactly. Life is really negative and if someone has no reason to push through the bullshit then why should they put up with it?
modernwarfare,fa88p99,t3_e71qc9,1575842948.0,Snipers are suppose to be viable at range otherwise there is no point in using them. I feel that the damage at range that snipers have is at a good point right now. Plus snipers really only get one chance to kill you in mid-long ranges.
modernwarfare,f9pba0i,t3_e52toj,1575528144.0,its sad how a game is ruined by greed. people on this site have been giving honest feedback and its obvious that the company only cares about stretching the game out and making money off cosmetics. everything feels like its half assed and not thought through. It seems like they prioritize cosmetics over good content. Was this game really worth 60 bucks at  launch? Its a joke
modernwarfare,f9l3hpa,t3_e5lbwa,1575413594.0,looks like they put more effort into the store than the actual game play.
LSD,f8tu3sn,t3_e0h0zz,1574811273.0,"I've had this same experience. I smoked some weed and instantly felt like I was on acid.(the last time I smoked was on acid so..) I knew it was impossible to get an acid trip off of weed, so I go to the bathroom and look at my eyes. They weren't red but my pupils were dilated like an acid trip. This was after a break from a bad acid/weed trip. I said fuck that took a benz and knocked out. note: I would smoke weed almost everyday before the bad trip and never had the kind of weed high like that. It seemed as if the weed re-sparked the lsd."
LSD,f7mocrv,t1_f7ikoyp,1573868925.0,Yea most definitely sent my world into chaos. Lol
LSD,f7moadl,t1_f7ippwv,1573868871.0,Yea I took two tabs then when I felt like I was getting back to “normal” I just took one pull from my pipe. I did have moments when things would slow down immensely and speed up. It took a lot of effort to try and avoid thought loops and what felt like losing my mind. I think I’ll post a trip report soon. Thx for the info man
LSD,f7ijt7j,t1_f7ijh6r,1573760727.0,I don’t know. Lsd especially makes your trip horrible.
LSD,ew08v7h,t3_cm68ha,1564979484.0,Looks good to me
LSD,etepc7k,t3_cb1677,1562740941.0,is this a gif or a picture?
