TrueOffMyChest,fnrsw25,t1_fnrr4cj,1587200298.0,"Okay, I'm going to respond bit by bit.

1. Yeah, it is open, but I just became angry reading it so I didnt really think it through.

2. I've always enjoyed watching drag. I always found it to be beautiful and I think that's those who do it are actually being themselves. They are not hurting someone else or themselves. People dont necessarily have to like it but calling them ""disgusting"" is why those people don't do it.

3. No, drag doesn't really have to do with being trans. But the way they were talking, you really think they'd respect someone who was transexual?

4. Yes, not all women want to have children. That is true. I just find it frustrating when they constantly complain over something that cannot be changed. It's a period, I understand that it is gross and painful, but its just the way our biology is.

5. And I never said men being oppressed invalidates women's suffering. It doesnt. We've been through a shit ton of oppression. I just also find it frustrating when someone ONLY thinks of their own oppression and doesn't realize that like you said,  both sexes have their ups and downs.

6. And no, you shouldnt have to have a hysterectomy if you dont want. I was angry so it was a spur of the moment thing. But like I said, we can't change them. And yeah, its valid to dread them and they can be pretty painful. And yeah when we're rolling around in bed, complaining because of cramps, that's fine. But constantly complaining and pointing to it, I find to be annoying. It's like complaining about having another body part, its just something that we have and we can't change it.

7. I'm not really going to apologize about what I said because I stand by it. But I am sorry that you think I'm disrespectful and a hypocrite.

Shit this was long, sorry."
TrueOffMyChest,fnrms73,t1_fnrm19r,1587194033.0,"What you're saying sounds extremely transphobic. Drag is actually really cool. Also, saying that there are ""downsides"" to being a woman just makes women feel bad for being female. I'm not going to complain about having a fucking period because it's what I need if I want to have kids in the future. It's just the way it is. It's the way biology assigned us and if you're so upset about it, go get a hysterectomy. 

Men are oppressed too. You just refuse to see it. Obviously, women have struggled with alot but it's not just us that have stereotypes and shit like that. 

It's not for goddamn convenience. It's how they feel the most like themselves. And it's people like you that makes them want to hide.

So please, if you're going to make a shitty statement like that, then don't comment on my post."

TrueOffMyChest,fnrkv1k,t1_fnrk89y,1587192194.0,"I'm sorry, I meant to mention that obviously not every femme male is like this. Growing up with two moms, I've been around many who are apart of the LGBTQ+ community. And I know not everyone is like how I described. It's just a trait that I found to be fairly common.

I understand what you are saying completely. But them being hurt still doesn't give them the right to be mean and cruel to others. Being toxic themselves, does not get rid of others who are toxic to them. But it is a form of a defense mechanism and I do understand.

I just couldnt stand hearing them insult every other person that we saw in public. It frustrated me and I told them this but they continued to anyways, instead calling me homophobic. That's what led to me writing this post.

Also, I know what you mean when you say calling someone a bitch is actually a term of endearment to you. Me and my friend do it and we find it hilarious."

EatingDisorders,fe4cth4,t3_enrty2,1578857960.0,ARFID sounds way more plausible. It is a form of an eating disorder. Basically what is it is extreme picky eating that's linked with a serious uninterest in food. It's mostly seen in younger children. It can become serious if it is taken too far as it can cause the child to become severely underweight or nutrient deficient like your brother. So I suggest you talk unto your parents or your brother if you're comfortable.
