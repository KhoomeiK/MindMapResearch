saxophone,f77lbfo,t3_dunzqy,1573462554.0,"Some people might disagree here, but I think it's really important to remember not to get caught up in brand names. 

I learned on a Selmer AS500 which is the American (Taiwanese made) variety. Personally I loved the horn, though I did eventually upgrade to a professional sax- here's where the real anecdote comes in. 

I went in with a belief that Selmer was the end all/ be all. Did a lot of research, probably stayed pretty biased

But when I actually went in to try out instruments (really important when buying one!!! I cannot stress enough how ordering online can be a gamble) 

The ones I thought were the ""best"" by name didn't compare to one of a brand I had never even heard before (Keilwerth ) 

I don't know how long you have been playing, looking for a long term inst on a budget or a student inst, but if you are buying a saxophone my best advice is to keep an open mind and try try try

Pretty much your basic target selection will be at Target

For a bigger selection/ slightly higher end, I second boots as the best place (especially one in a shopping center such as dundrum) though you'll find a fair amount in any rx 

If you're looking for bulk / top of the line, there are a few Sally's sprinkled throughout (one in town a few minutes from
 Grafton, one in swords) there you can get Costco sized stuff if you don't feel like going in often

On math terms you can't round to the nearest penny without a smaller decimal place trailing it.. so it's rounding to the nickel?

YouShouldKnow,euzdxd3,t1_euyhtzy,1564117821.0,"Technically you're not rounding to the nearest .05 though... Because you would have a trailing decimal place

At least in the USA, 1.06 would always be rounded to 1.10
