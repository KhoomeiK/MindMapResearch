SuicideWatch,fo4vchl,t3_g5ozt4,1587511947.0,You are valid. I always say this... we always hear the story about the drama queen who killed herself for attention. People who kill themselves for attention need help. They are screaming. Imagine being so neglected that you’re willing to give your life to finally be heard. That being said I understand you. But try to reach out. The fact that you have to go this far means something. Life has been cruel to you.
