NoStupidQuestions,fqpkexl,t3_gk8o45,1589548473.0,"Technically, it is possible to quantify any food you eat. That, however, requires some work. You have to know all the ingredients and their caloric value and their quantities. From there it's simple math and you can calculate the caloric value of a given portion. 
However, that is something most people don't really have the time or motivation to do, so let me suggest a different way. There are a lot of apps out there that have a huge database of foods and their caloric values. Use that as a reference. If you can not find the food you are looking for there are usually options that allow you to create a meal. You find the ingredients from the list and add then to make a meal. After that you can estimate, or even measure the portion of said meal that you ate and it will give you a close enough value. If you are eating something that can vary a lot in caloric value, such as piece of cake for example, and you do not know what went into it, I usually try and find a similar kind on the app and opt for the one with a bigger caloric value, just so I don't go easy on myself.
That being said, while calorie counting is a good way of tracking what you eat during the day and it allows you to modify your eating patterns, I don't think you should concearn yourself with making it 100% accurate. Getting withing 100-200 kcal is a pretty good way of tracking you caloric intake."

TooAfraidToAsk,fq68gp4,t1_fq5s35b,1589126605.0,"Really? That is baffling to me to be honest. Gynecology is a separate specialty for a reason. There are a lot of reasons women go to a gynecologist and GPs aren't equipped to deal with those problems. 

Where I'm from women have a right to two 'chosen doctors'. One is your GP and they deal with pretty much everything. But you have a right to a chosen gynecologist that operates within the primary healthcare system and they are basically completely separate. All gynecological issues go to him/her and they have the authority to give you all the necessary test for any gynecological issue. You basically get to have two completely separate medical charts, one for your GP and one for your gynecologist. And I actually think it's a pretty good system as many women dread going to the gynecologist as is, if they had to deal with all that at a GP's office I don't think half the women would even go to those exams."

TooAfraidToAsk,fpraprd,t3_gf4371,1588848459.0,"I like to cook and bake, but I do not like eating. Few reasons:

1. I am almost never really really hungry

2. 9/10 times after I eat I feel bad and I live with an almost constant sensation of nausea so food tends to aggravate that (and before someone chimes in yes I have seen doctors I had some treatments that work some that made it a lot worse, but in general, I'm used to it)

3. While I can appreciate that some people enjoy food to me it really doesn't matter what I eat. It's food, it will be sustenance for a while and that's enough for me. There are like 2-3 kinds of food I really love and could eat any day but that's about it.

4. Honestly, if it was possible, I'd get most of my daily calory intake via an i.v. and I'd be totally cool with that. I'd eat some snacks and some sweets and would be perfectly happy

In conclusion - it's just food. I appreciate the good flavour of certain foods but in the end, it's just food."

depression,fpa7jul,t3_gcafy0,1588442408.0,"Depression is a tricky lil disease. It can manifest differently in different people and in some it can be very hard to spot, in others it can lead to a debilitating sadness that leaves them unable to leave the bed, and then again, it can make people go to that place you described - the void without emotions. Sometimes it comes in waves, sometimes it's ever present. 

It is difficult to describe this emotionless void to someone who has never experienced it. You are there, present in the world, but you can just sit in a spot, stare into the distance and your mind is completely blank. There is this nabbing at the back of your head that you should be sad or angry or .... something! But you aren't. You are just.... there. You exist. There is no pain, no sadness, no bad feelings coming at you. And yet, there is no joy in it, there is no motivation to do something to entertain yourself, you are perfectly contempt to just exist. Like frozen in time and place. To be honest, I think a lot of the times this is worse than the sadness. Sadness is an emotion, and while it can hurt even to the point of physical pain, the void in a way strips you of your humanity. This is when some people hurt themselves. Pain is better than nothing. 

I am sorry it turned out the way it did with that guy, and yes, you may date someone who has similar issues again. What are you to do, depends on the person. And this is where communication comes in place. Good communication with the other person will give you the insight you need. Sometimes people just need to be left alone. Don't take it personally, it doesn't mean they don't like you or want you around, sometimes people just need to be alone. Sometimes all you can do is be there, even if not physically you can be there emotionally, as a person to talk to, someone that will listen and even if you don't understand it all, it counts. Believe me, it counts a lot when you can just be there and listen and offer support. Some days diverting attention to a different topic, making the person laugh, talking about nonsense, some days those will work. If you care about the person, and you are able to communicate honestly your desires to each other, understanding and willingness is all the tools you need. 

Anyway, I am sorry for the long answer, I can be sappy sometimes, but I hope you found it helpful."

This is what I was referring to. It is a bit of a generalization don't you think? 

> Appeal to authority fallacy 

Not really. I do not consider myself an authority on any of this. I phrased it that way in order to say I have studied the issue from a medical standpoint and from legitimate sources.

> Nor would a woman do it either unless something was very wrong. Do you think anyone would willingly choose this? 

I believe this is where we have our misunderstanding. I am not implying in any way that every pregnancy should be carried to term. There are plenty legitimate reasons for abortions after 20 or so weeks. What I was trying to say (unsuccessfully apparently) is that abortions should be regulated. Actually, I believe I did say so, but no matter. Meaning - sometimes late term abortions are necessary or simply a better option, whether because of the mothers health or because the fetus has some form of a serious anomaly. I am not advocating bans on abortions, I am advocating regulations. Creating laws and guidelines that would allow women to have an abortion that long into pregnancy, but also create a system that would not be abused.  

> I wish that poverty and life issues didn't keep some women from a timely abortion when needed. I look forward to the day it comes. 

I understand that in the US abortions are a luxury basically, but that is not an abortion issue. That is a healthcare system issue that I do believe should be fixed, even tho Americans don't seem to be even close to doing so."
Documentaries,ex7qnvq,t1_ex7m1bk,1566063623.0,"What? What kind of a crazy conspiracy theory is that? Again, I don't live in the US, I don't really know what these ""campaigns"" are on a day to day basis. I am talking as someone who is a medical student and has seen both abortions and births. I have no issue with abortion. To be honest I have no wish to become a parent and would likely have an abortion if I became pregnant. But I would not do it in the 3rd trimester unless medically advised to. It is a traumatic and long process, and there is rarely a need for it in today's day and age, as pregnancy tests cost like 3 euros and most women have a menstrual cycle of around 4 weeks."

Documentaries,ex79ute,t1_ex721rr,1566057840.0,"Why? It is true. I did't say abortions should be illegal. What I am trying to say is they should be regulated, as most other things in a civilized society are. 
Late term abortions, as well as any abortion for that matter, are unpleasant, this is true. However, the later the abortion the greater the risk to the woman. This is why there has to be some form of regulation around it. Call me centrist, I don't care, but where I come from abortion is accepted, regulated and cheap. We ain't got these issues."
Documentaries,ex6l424,t1_ex6iv5j,1566047440.0,I keep saying that. I do not understand the American obsession of making ALL abortions illegal or making ALL abortions legal. There are perfectly good solutions inbetween.

depression,ew3p8qj,t3_cmp5lb,1565089962.0,"Well, there is a difference between sadness and depression. It can be subtle, but let's put it this way. While both depression and sadness can manifest in a lot of the same ways, sadness always has a cause. You gave a great example, being very sad and feeling very bad after a break up or a fight, or death of a loved one is normal. Depression can be provoked by sad or disturbing events in life, but often times, depression is sort of like sadness without a cause. I can not tell you what you were feeling, but imagine a sadness so deep that nothing, nothing and no one can truly snap you out of it. A sadness that makes you sit alone, maybe even cry, feel horrible or feel nothing at all. A sadness that makes you feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Now that, is depression. Depression has many faces, but the thing that separates it from ""mere"" sadness is the fact that sadness comes with sad events, with bad things happening in life. Depression just comes. And it is usually there to stay for a while."

As I said, I don't slam editing, I think people who can edit their photos and make them into more of a work art are, well, artists. I'm just pointing out that, in my mind at least, that is a different category, a whole new level. 
As for GS, I've loved photography a lot longer than I have had a profile there. And thank you. I'm sort of short on time with all my obligations and way too many hobbies, but if I do ever decide to edit my photos, I may just ask you a few questions :)"
gurushots,evy0mvr,t1_evxw2sp,1564917464.0,"Well they do say art is subjective. To me, photography is capturing a perfect moment for the beauty it holds.
