I'm mad at myself for not doing my job while working from home, but then I get scared of doing my job, im in sales, and just stare at the phone. Then I get mad at myself for staring at the phone, but I cant bring myself to call people. Its kicking my ass right now."

BipolarReddit,ffjvc3k,t3_et2lbh,1580007961.0,"I think about suicide every day. All throughout the day. Work distracts me, until something goes wrong. Then it's back to the forefront. Fantasizing about driving into traffic, stepping in front of a bus, lots of different ways. Just so I don't have to deal with the bullshit anymore. It's always one thing after another. One step forward and three steps back. I'm just not good at being a person and Im sick of trying. I lash out at loved ones and purposely say terrible things to them. Things that I know will really hurt them. It feels like it would be better if it was over. Who knows what happens when you die. Cowardice keeps me from doing it I guess. Or just a desire to be miserable."
