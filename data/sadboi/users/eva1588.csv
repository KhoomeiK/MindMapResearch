Exercise,fq6fyid,t3_ggtldv,1589130769.0,"When you are overeating, do you know its happening?  Slowing down before you go to eat, and slowing down while you eat may help you be more mindful. Rather than going to the kitchen super hungry and eating everything because it tastes so good. I have tried this in the past and it really helps me get into a mindful state- When meal time is approaching, or a sense of hunger, I pause and  take a few minutes to rest. Usually its best if I lay down flat on my back. After a few minutes of breathing and resting, I am much more calm. The hunger is still there, but its not controlling me and I am able to make the right food choices for myself. Then after I eat, I pause again and give myself time to see if I want anything more. If I do, then I have some more, if not then I'm done. By the end of the meal I am confident that I gave myself what I needed for that meal. The key for me was slowing down the whole process by slowing myself down. Thats what helped me be more mindful."

Maybe your anxiety levels are different now that you are home, so you may not need as much for now. I would try cutting back to see if you can feel relaxed, not sleepy. You should only sleep in the day if you you truly are sleep deprived and need to catch up. In that case, definitely get more sleep.  But if you believe it is mostly the drug, then cutting back could be helpful. If you are worried about withdrawal, you could just change the timing of you doses by taking less in the daytime and the remaining in the evening before bed. If this still isn't right, then you can try lowering the dose. And see if that helps. It will probably be a bit of a trial and error."
