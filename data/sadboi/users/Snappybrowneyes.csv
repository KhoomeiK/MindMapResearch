What she did was completely wrong and I agree with other posts that she was trying to eavesdrop on your conversation. I would not ask your husband to not see his mother but request that he not speak about you with her when he does visit her. That way she cannot blame you for “ruining” her relationship with her son.

Most hospitals have a set of specific questions they ask, about depression and suicide, when the patient is seen in the ER or as an inpatient. Based on the answers to those questions a Psych consult is placed. If the Psychiatrist recommends inpatient treatment they can EDO the patient. 
Unfortunately, if she is not a danger to herself or others, she will likely be released. If she is open to help from you then I would recommend looking up “ people who have overcome Borderline Personality Disorder.” There are forums and books out there that will give her hope and teach her how to manage her feelings. Good luck!"

There are also some apps for DBT that your friend can download to her phone. This should not take the place of the ER visit but can help her to stay on track after she is stabilized."

Bad behavior, from a family member or friend, should not ever be accepted. Ironically, my ex-friend tried to get back in to my good graces on many occasions.
