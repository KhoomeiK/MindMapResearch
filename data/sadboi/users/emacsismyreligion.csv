You love your kids right? Sounds like you completely do. My dad loves his kids, and I still love him, even though I will never speak to him again.

My dad beat the shit out of me because he couldn't control his moods. That only started after over a decade of his use. When I was 6 years old, I was raped (male here) by one of his tweaker friends. Now, he has a shell of a life.

I moved in with him and his girlfriend (both PhDs by the way, not stupid), eventually started getting high with him (he didn't introduce me), and MAN those were good times. Until they completely, utterly, weren't.

I miss him a lot. But not who he is now. I can only save myself. This shit is a waste of time and life that will take not only everything you have but slowly destroy everything you thought was your own immutable self. Here's what's scary: it doesn't matter how much you love your kids. Few people plan to become dangerous or scary (especially through a child's eyes), but. . . you'll do anything to get to sleep after a week of ignoring physical necessities. That's what's so fucked up; it's not necessarily anyone's fault—I know I have forgiven my dad, but I still don't talk to him.

You want the same? You want your kids to get into this stuff? Not an attack, just questions.

I recommend going into a *good* treatment program. Doesn't have to be expensive, but look into the reviews. I sincerely wish you the best of luck. Please take care.

Edit: More suggestions. If you don't think treatment is necessary, try any combination of Crystal Meth Anonymous or other 12 step, psychiatry, and/or psychotherapy. (For therapy, I found psychoanalysis most helpful. I saw an analyst with extensive history/training in addiction.)"

Psychotherapy was an integral part of my (ongoing, as of six years after diagnosis lol) recovery personally, and the scientific literature shows significantly better long term outcomes with BOTH treatments (meds + psychosocial healing).

EDIT: I realized this comment was a bit cold. You can ask me any questions you have about therapy, and I'll try to answer them, based off my non-expert personal experience of being in therapy to treat psychosis for six years. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is insanely helpful for active suicidal impulses (no, it's not just for borderline PD), and psychoanalysis is life-changing once stability is reached because then the depths of the issues can be plumbed. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is used with great success for coping (albeit superficially) with hallucinations, delusions, and negative symptoms.

EDIT 2: Looked briefly at your post history. Two things: STOP smoking weed. The correlation between cannabis consumption and psychosis is incredibly established and undeniable, to the point where some researchers posit causation--a triggering of underlying symptoms. Second thing, since you've been in therapy for a while, I would honestly recommend seeking psychoanalysis. It was a last resort for me, and it changed my life. Look up: ""psychoanalysis board"" ""[your state/town]"" and go through the membership directory and call clinicians, or if you live in a city, look up ""psychoanalysis clinic"". It's important to get someone actually trained as an analyst. If you go through my submission history, I wrote an essay on my experience in psychoanalysis, which may be helpful for understanding why it can be a good--even indispensable--option for the treatment of psychosis when all else has failed, after a semblance of stability is reached, as well as my personal experience with this modality of treatment.

Also, communicate clearly with your prescriber about any and all psychoactive drug use, and try--if you can--to seek out a prescriber (if your current one is not to your liking) who follows a ""less is more"" philosophy with regards to medication. This is because most cutting edge psychosis research has revised clinical guidelines and is attempting to change the general practice of the field to follow a minimalist philosophy of medication management (lowest effective doses, co-ordination with psychotherapy, avoidance of antipsychotic polypharmacy, et cetera).

If you find yourself in a seemingly interminable, desperate, long-lasting crisis (such as several months of *severe* depression, mania, catatonia, or psychosis potentially culminating in a hospitalization), you may want to talk to your doctor about electroconvulsive therapy. This legitimately **saved my life** and afforded me the ability to graduate high school. I had no long-term side effects at all, but after sixteen rounds (with the last three being continuation treatment), I had to stop due to being unable to tolerate the anesthesia (for reasons hard to explain, but it was psychological). However, I wish I kept going with it or was able to keep going. It sounds scary, and even doctors are hesitant with it, oftentimes due to stigma, but it is a completely safe treatment for a variety of severe psychiatric problems. In fact, it is primarily given to the elderly because **for them, medications are more dangerous than ECT.** Think about that; antipsychotics are more likely to lead to neurodegeneration and severe metabolic crises in at-risk populations, than ECT is likely to lead to any of its rare side effects (which often don't last more than two weeks after the end of treatment). Not saying you *should* do this, as it's a last-resort treatment, but it should be considered if you find yourself seriously needing it. I say this from experience.

Anyway, I'll link the essay on my experience in psychoanalysis in a second.

psychoanalysis,fp0hk5y,t1_fp0b089,1588209406.0,"Good question. The Internet is double sided of course. It is a tool which should be used wisely, and used for a *purpose*, but most of the time, it is not used wisely, or even for any real purpose at all. When people spend too much time on the Internet—which depends on which sites/apps one is using—they can easily become dysfunctional: socially, sexually for some people (pornography), and most commonly in their ability to sustain focus on tasks not necessarily ~required~ of them, but that could be productive, or even fun, if their attention span wasn't impaired by constant super-stimulus. For example, I wrote this essay after a long period of ""Internet fasting"" (which, despite what some 'gurus' claim, cannot be simplified to dopamine pop theories) as well as psychostimulant abstinence. It was legitimately so much fun for me.

I use the Internet in two ways: accessing knowledge, and connecting with others to discuss topics of interest. I note that the Internet is actually not a very effectual way to gather knowledge more cohesive than fragments of important information. Unfortunately the incredible depth a good scholarly non-fiction book explores on a topic, the utility of the public library, and the importance of sourcing/citing, is lost entirely on persons of every generation today. No, reading a Wikipedia article does not make you an expert on anything, and sometimes it doesn't even give you enough to knowledge (differentiated here from *information*) to even craft an informed opinion on the matter. I try not to even have opinions on thinkers, historical or otherwise, if I haven't read at least part of their primary work, directly.

What we have in the present day situation with the superstimuli of the Internet is a significant shortening of attention span (which, in youth, especially in technological natives born some time after 2000, has often been implicated in the drastic spike in executive functioning disorders diagnosis; think 6 year olds prescribed amphetamines), as well as what I call ""the surface level polymath""—people believe themselves to be experts on damn near everything because they read a Reddit post or a Wikipedia article. As a result of access to information on an infinite breadth of topics, yet information which sits mainly at the surface level of the topic that would be explored in significantly more depth in a good book or oral tradition from an expert teacher, **people know a very little about a LOT of different things.**

But of course, many people don't have the attention span to read a book that could actually teach them something in depth. This is why we have such drastic rates of functional illiteracy in a mass ""educated"" society. I'm speaking from experience here—I wrote people's essays for them when I was in high school in exchange for cocaine and amphetamine, and I'm gonna tell it to you straight: most people, at least my age or younger, read at an 8th grade level and have writing skills *worse* than that.

The second purpose and fault of the Internet is community/discussion/connection. One can genuinely develop meaningful relationships over the Internet, or have meaningful, enriching discussions. But it is all dependent really on the type of community one is entering, the identified purpose of its use, and the balance of Internet and real-life discussion, connection, and relationships. I know too many people who are so painfully ignorant of the realities and diversities of the human experience because they have neglected socializing in preference for the Internet. In the worst case, people become literally radicalized and imbued with toxic ideologies (which I define not by the nature of the ideology but on its impact on the subject and their quality of life), driving them further into isolation.

Another aspect of the Internet, in relation to what I was talking about before with a lack of reliance on long-form texts or print media, is the loss of the local newspaper. Most people live in a literal automated feedback loop of their own little information --> worldview bubble, because they seek out ""news"" that reinforces their perspectives, then because of ""optimally tailored recommendations"" (done by artificial intelligence-like programs) as well as the agendas of the hosting site/app, the influence of paying parties and advertisements as ""news"", many people end up seeing less and less of opposing viewpoints in their feed, and consuming more and more cognitive-worldview reinforcement.

You can also see the effects of the Internet and tech on the local, community level, as people ignore their neighbors as they stare at their screen, for example. I have noticed, in my short time on Earth, a systemic and exponentially worsening decimation of the **community as connected symbiosis.**

Let's not ignore the privacy, surveillance, and data-raping horrors facilitated by the Internet. . .

I'll finish by describing how I use the Internet. I use Reddit, but only small niche subreddits related to my interests, or good peer support-based subreddits. I am somewhat active on Twitter because it is THE place to connect, at least online, with other poets, writers, and academics. Most of the BS can be avoided by only following people who represent a specific community that serves a purpose in your life. This goes back to using the Internet for a purpose. I only use Twitter because it has drastically benefited my writing career, allows me to read the latest small literary journals and get updates from presses, and connect with other poets. On both Reddit and Twitter, there's honestly been times where I've been moved to tears by the kindness and goodness of some people. For example, many people on the poetry community of Twitter (which consists mainly of actual published semi-professionals), I was able to message and develop friendly relationships with them, to the point where many have given me their phone number. With at least three people, we talk regularly over the phone, and have plans to meet up in person eventually. Other people on Reddit, I was able to connect with over other platforms / messaging services, and one I have an in-person friendship with (because we found ourselves living in our same home city again!)

I will use some social media very very occasionally as a messaging service when I don't have someone's number. But overall, I prefer in-person contact, phone/voice call, email, or even written letter correspondence (yes, I have ""penpals"" lol) over anything else.

The gist: it's a good thing if used wisely, and with an actual purpose."

My goal is to live off drugs, off medication (reserved for emergencies), but honestly I may continue to take the Vraylar because I like it so much. Although too high of a dose makes me tweak out (gives me insane energy and weird mannerisms). I have a problem with insufflating Vraylar, which leads to a stimulation that increases energy, cognition, and focus (and severely decreases sleep) omparable to amphetamine salts, but without the euphoria.

radicalmentalhealth,fnrkuvn,t1_fnoqq4c,1587192190.0,"Working with a therapist/psychologist, yeah. It's pretty hard to find good therapists actually, and maybe this is just my bias or preference, but I only made *tangible* progress, not just feeling more comforted, with practitioners trained and licensed in the psychoanalytical tradition. Because honestly I believe psychiatry has literally taken a step back; first, the emphasis was on the neurodegenerative, pseudoscientific biology of mental illness, then psychoanalysis, while having its serious flaws, placed the superlative emphasis on childhood trauma negligible to severe as the cause of mental illness and the determinant of its content/quality. Then once meds / pharma got involved, suddenly that's bogus and everyone just has a brain disorder and needs pills.

For the record, I actually got back on a very, very small dose of my meds (below the minimum) and find it optimal. I have nuanced ideas on psychiatry and would not consider myself anti-psychiatry or strictly for psychiatry.

Edit: Also, rereading your post I related / agree with a lot. I felt pushed through the system too, for seven years. Hospital experiences were highly traumatic. I do believe that quality psychotherapy is huge, or at least it was for me. The emphasis on quality because I have had *several* absolutely terrible, re-traumatizing experiences with therapists and it was hard to trust them at all. After working with a young but qualified therapist (she was a psychologist who was trained in Lacanian psychoanalysis) I finally made it to one full year out of the hospital, got clean from meth, got employed at a place that gave me so much meaning/rewarding occupational experience, had a MAJOR breakthrough about trauma, escaped a dangerous living environment, discovered goals/career path, and found (or returned) to a form of spirituality in which I find Truth.

Honestly I tend to steer very clear of CBT practitioners. It feels like complete surface-level bullshit to me."

Anyway, I spent about six months in psychotherapy with a young psychologist who was a trained and licensed Lacanian psychoanalyst. It completely changed my life. On February 11, I gave myself this tattoo to celebrate one full year out of the mental hospital, the first since I was 13. My diagnosis is schizophrenia, or some say, schizoaffective bipolar type. More coming on the successful treatment of severe psychotic/thought disorders with various schools of psychoanalysis. Just give me a couple hours to write something up—pretty busy right now.

ShrugLifeSyndicate,fmh573l,t3_fv8p18,1586067124.0,"Also here is what fellow authors have to say about my book:

The intimate journey of ""a 'compliant' schizophrenic / marveling at the enormous bending light / of pareidolic wondering."" Even if you haven't had these igniting experiences — some triggered by drugs from the hospital & from the street — Miller leads you to the sanctum. You have to ""pull out / the bare soil, clay heavy with moonlight, / carefully crawl into the Design…"" & ""let yourself / dissolve in liminal corners of the great / nothing."" This mystic disorder is given structure by the poet's bodily knowledge. It is a conversation with a mysterious partner, a beloved who might be you.

— Tucker Lieberman, author of Bad Fire


Miller writes in GLORY/TREE/GHOST as equal parts visionary and mad man while his verses smear the lines between. GLORY/TREE/GHOST paints a flurry of drugs, insanity, & spirituality & with its unashamed confessions, it reveals with visceral urgency the conflict of old & new, tradition & deviance, insight, & delusion. Miller weaves a narrative tapestry that clings to the little tragic miracles of mundane images animated by illusive higher powers & city streets, becoming a testament to the beauty that can be found in depravity on a journey towards the hope that waits on the other side of madness.

— Vita Rhie Quintanilla, author of The Schizophrenic Dialogues


GLORY/TREE/GHOST will take you on a sojourn through addiction & madness, leading inward—toward discovering oneself. Miller gives a rare glimpse of an out of body incandescence struggling to cross over the boundary toward healing & self through the cloud of euphoria & destruction. You find yourself tasting the discipline it takes to somehow remain in the turbulence—only to backpedal from the inevitable crash.

And keep in mind while you're doing this that it is very much a slippery slope. Also keep in mind that microdosing it will actually upregulate your D2 receptors similar to long-term antipsychotic usage, which can lead to persistent psychotic/manic symptoms, strange mannerisms & tics, altered behavior & sleep patterns, et cetera."
