It's okay people react differently and at different times"
Anxiety,fmxf23o,t1_fmxefmf,1586463787.0,"Yeah, I both have really sensitive ears so I always have Noice Cancelling headphones with me in case of loud noises, but then I can't process a lot of speaking noises at the same time either"
Anxiety,fmxdkxp,t3_fxzgrd,1586462999.0,It's the same for me. I can't handle too much of any type of sensory and it makes me very tired.
Anxiety,flkwm2k,t3_fph9vt,1585249049.0,"Yeah but it does go away. Though it's harder if you worry about it because then you are thinking about it.
I get earworms too but they disappear"
Anxiety,fknm7d1,t3_fjl86j,1584369070.0,I'm so sorry and hope you can get out of there soon. You can do it! Try to keep close to someone you trust and it might feel easier.
Anxiety,fk3sxv3,t1_fk3l5j0,1583845421.0,"Yeah luckily the chance of that happening is very small so as long as you check your head in case of that you slam it hard into something by mistake that gives you a headache, you should not worry because very most certainly likely, nothing will happen while you sleep."
Anxiety,fk3l2hx,t3_fgbcbc,1583838241.0,"Yup happens to me too. I worry way too much about a lot of things that I know is just stupid, such as ""What if I stop breathing in my sleep"" ""What if I by shaking my head as a tic got an internal bleeding and will die in my sleep"" ""What making this decision is wrong but what if the other is wrong"" and proceeding to overthink. Or the most common one. ""What if I will get a dangerous disease""
so you're not alone"

It's not like I can say ""Oh I did this this month when I was 10"" but I have loose memories from then and like I know how I was like and I remember quite a lot/ a lot from 4 years ago to now and even more from 2 years ago to now"

Anxiety,fcfau1z,t3_eh4sws,1577628166.0,"CBT. Meaning Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, meaning that you start in a small scale to expose yourself to your fears, such as, maybe taking one bite from that food. At first, your anxiety will go up a lot, but in reality it's lying and after a while your body will realize that this wasn't anything to worry about and nothing happened, when it feels okay to do so you make it a little more difficult, exposing yourself to something that might give you slightly more anxiety, but that does so for no logical reason (you won't die from eating untouched parts of food from someone else's plating) and then after a while, it won't be as bad anymore.
For example I did CBT for my arachnophobia, first I had to be near a spider in a jar until it wasn't scary anymore, then, closer but still in a jar, then kinda far away and without a jar, and so on."
Anxiety,fcf98y4,t3_eh5d7p,1577627770.0,"My resolution is to work with my anxiety, find more strategies for when I have anxiety and how to not overthink etc, and also to talk more about it to my parents."

Anxiety,fayoi6c,t3_eawv1i,1576404201.0,"I have a friend that comments my mistakes too, and he doesn't always know what is socially acceptable so if a teacher would say something he found weird, he could say something like ""Only mad people would say that"" or something like that, but in general he is a pretty good friend, always waiting for me if I am slow getting my stuff before we go on the bus and so. Maybe your friend just doesn't always know how to behave? If so maybe telling him that's not nice to say or something when he comments on all bad things. And maybe it's another reason and they Idk but talking about it and if you get annoyed when he comments a typo you can say that, or something"
Anxiety,f8o60v5,t3_e1bcop,1574664302.0,"Well if you have anxiety over whether or not you have anxiety.. yeah. Best thing I think is to meet someone that can diagnose you, most parents would not ""fight"" but support, mental illness isn't really uncommon and can be somewhat ""treated"" meaning you find coping mechanisms and train on not freaking out in certain situations etc."
Anxiety,f7roimt,t3_dxj14z,1573984800.0,"I've also felt that. But trust me trying to deal with it alone doesn't work.
If you have a hard time talking about yourself to others, maybe say that, and first just listen, maybe he/she has some general advice, maybe you can talk a little generally about anxiety, and then when you feel comfortable enough, to talk about yourself?"

Anxiety,f7pai6e,t3_dx7twa,1573946359.0,"Yeah. I don't care too much about my appearance, I mean, I'm not responsible for my DNA anyways. But my personality and what I do.. yes. Anxiety made me this way. Every day, every thing I do or say, I know my brain will judge me for afterwards. Every time I do something that I later realized I could have done a different way that just might have had a slighter better outcome, my mind will judge me and criticise me for and I will replay how I ""should"" have done it over and over again until I am totally exhausted.

But no. You can't fix anything. What you got to realise is that no one is perfect and doing your best is enough. Why be a certain way when you can be you? You're the best in the whole world at being you."

You could try using lypsyl. And then leave it be for as long as you can, atleast over the night. That should make them way better, from my experience.
You can also try making small goals, like, leaving it be for x mins, then 2x mins and so on."
