japanlife,fpkbfn0,t1_fpkaqb1,1588691605.0,Huh why?
japanlife,fpk1vl4,t1_fpjltzb,1588686299.0,I feel the 0% downpayment was really a rare case. For apartment normally the downpayment is 5% of the property price.
japanlife,fpk1kzv,t1_fpjvgnh,1588686124.0,Haha I believe I will bring all my lights too if the owner cannot give me a discount of security deposit.
japanlife,fpk1ewf,t1_fpjq0ig,1588686022.0,"The returns really depend on the properties, but normally you can expect to find a multi-unit project for investment with over 4%-8% gross rate of return.

However the case you mentioned is actually becoming more because of the effect of coronavirus -- many of them were built for traveller accommodations (like Airbnb), however the revenue in last few months is a disaster. So some companies choose to sell the whole building in a lower price than usual to get money for operation. In that case, you have to check whether it's supposed to be easy to rent out.

1, The downpayment is supposed to be 5%\~10% of the property price; If the downpayment is more than 10 million, the contract needs to include the insurance for the downpayment.

2, Normally it varies from 1%\~4%, depending on the bank and the applier.

3, The cap rate really bases on the condition of the property and the location.

Sorry I'm not sure whether I understood the lat question. Do you mean you want to know what kind of people should consider this type of investment?"
japanlife,fpjosf0,t1_fpjnqa2,1588676330.0,"I guess you've already had the experience of using local agent to buy your first apartment here.

My recommendation is also telling a local agent what you exactly want, because local agents always have a lot of information which won't be published on internet.

By the way if you are looking for something above 150 million yen, it might be a good timing to do that. For now, the coronavirus hasn't really affected price of little apartments for single use, but the average price of big properties is going down."

Sorry I have to reply to you in the new post.

Thanks for the questions. 

First, if you own a house instead of renting one, you can save the house rent every month -- However, the initial cost of purchasing a house is roughly calculated as 3%-10% of the property price, which includes the cost for revenue stamp, agent, administrative scrivener, acquisition tax etc.

Second, if the property is located in a popular area and close to subway station, you can rent it out if you don't want to live there anymore, which can bring you a stable income. However, when it's empty, you still have to pay for the tax and other maintaining fees.

Third, you can find it here [Land price of Tokyo](https://tochidai.info/tokyo/) that the average land price in Tokyo is growing sloooowly in the last 20 years. It's a double-edged sword -- you don't have to worry too much about the property will worth nothing in a short time but you also cannot expect it to worth double in a short time.  


One last thing, different from found or other investment product, you cannot cash out immediately. But at the same time, you don't have to check the price of your property everyday."

Sorry I have to reply to you in the new post.

Well, I won't say as long as you pay more you can get a better place anywhere because sometimes the options are really limited depending on Building Standard Law in Japan.

However would you like to tell me what made you feel in that way exactly? For example, is it about the noise, size, lighting or anything else?"
japanlife,fpjk417,t3_gduit2,1588671504.0,"By the way, here are the questions under my last post which was post in a wrong area.

1, Why are homes in Japan such lousy quality?

2, What is the financial value of owning a house versus renting in Tokyo? What are the financial benefits versus drawbacks?

3, In terms of percentage of the home value, how much downpayment do you usually need to purchase a home in Japan?

4, If you do not have the full amount of downpayment, can you put less cash in and then pay a monthly mortgage insurance to compensate? This arrangement is common in the USA."

I don’t want to deny that they have good intentions, but I also think some of them want to prove that they can be helpful and they are needed. 
Some of them want to feel good by doing that."

I’m sorry it wasn’t literally one hour every time it could just be very long.

Actually tonight I made some progress thanks to all the suggestions here — Which can also be listed as an example of how we communication.

A few days ago he told me 1)how he felt I was thinking about something and 2)how he thought about it.

Today I asked the reason of 2), Why he thought in that way. 
Though he got lost right after starting, I listened to the end without any interruption — I even counted the time — he spent 30 minutes on explaining why he felt I was thinking in that way.

Then he got stuck and took a really long break. Then I asked, can I still ask for the reason of 2)?"

Though I’ve never experienced something like this in the past relationships, maybe I should go to a therapist for help. 

Your suggestions on what he should do are very appreciated too. But unfortunately he refuses to write it down... he thinks verbal communication causes less misunderstandings."

The excuse was I couldn’t find another way to help myself be heard, but as a fact I know it doesn’t work in the way when I calm down.
