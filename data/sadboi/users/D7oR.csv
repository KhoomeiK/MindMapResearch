modernwarfare,fkyhzro,t3_flgpkc,1584649116.0,This happens when you have more than one controller signed in. Just make sure only one controller is on it you aren’t switching mid game between controllers due to battery level or whatever

modernwarfare,femyhkl,t3_eq07q5,1579272856.0,"Love the way you are blaming this guy for using the 725 and you are there with a gold mp5. I don’t mind 725 players in shoothouse as most you are just running into while they are grinding. But gold M4,Mp5 and 725 players who play shoothouse/shipment are shit tier players who don’t have the gun skill to use anything less than the OverPoweredness they have grown accustomed to."

modernwarfare,femwy14,t3_eprziv,1579271767.0,This used to happen to me years ago but was playing on a tv and it had an auto sizing feature on. Maybe the monitor has a similar setting and it resets size once you die and the game black screens during killcam or whatever. Hope this helps

modernwarfare,fdsd9yo,t3_emhhes,1578700008.0,Hopped on today again and my friend goes oh I got a free pack again. I’m done.
modernwarfare,fdpdtit,t3_emhhes,1578626089.0,Am I the only one not getting these free packs either that my friends keep talking about and sending me pictures of ? Sorry Activison must be because I stupidly spent more money on a 'better' edition of the game than my friends. Why should I get free stuff right ?

depression,fa8np5w,t3_dyazjo,1575850414.0,I’d pay €5k just to be killed by a car. Often thought of this it’s such a good option really. Family will get over it ‘oh what a terrible accident he was so young’ and also I’m at peace and at peace I didn’t leave family members in shit either. Honestly just haven’t foolproofed it yet. Knowing my luck I’d be paralysed and left to live the rest of my days focusing on swallowing my own spit.
depression,fa8mj1n,t3_e7xy2i,1575849674.0,It was my birthday today and it was everything I dreaded it would be and so much more. I’ve been avoiding life for weeks now after a spiral of unfortunate events and reality snook back into my life today and more suicidal than ever. Fucking hate birthdays they are the worst. It’s that slight glimmer in the back of your head that it might actually be an okay day and it might be how other people’s birthdays are with things going nicely and you telling good about yourself. But no it’s shit on top of more shit and a nice shit filling inside that too. Expectation kills me because I try to keep hope but when I hope for anything to go right it never does and it hurts twice as bad. So yeah happy birthday all. Can’t wait for Christmas...

CoDCompetitive,f9o7zf0,t1_f9o7pyk,1575498411.0,But even still I know competitive apex players that would drop €20 on skins that made ironsights better on guns. I know it’s not game changing but every single detail matters in competitive.
