AnxietyDepression,fp85jm4,t1_fp7roai,1588384072.0,"""High level introvert."" That explains everything of what's been going on. At first, I was writing, playing music, even planned some crafty art things, did academic-esque work, and now I can barely keep up with work. I have been cleaning, but more as a compulsion. I keep looking around my place to find stuff to organize, clean, donate. Seeing dollar signs over everything I own makes living really sad right now.

My cat's name is William. He is 7 months old and the size of a grown adult. He's wonderful and crazy and annoying and lovely. In my cleaning, I found a foam ball that he absolutely loves to go after. He jumps and pounces on it. It's adorable. And I found he likes crouching in small spaces like the fridge or cabinet shelf so I have to be careful what I open and close!

I can definitely relate to the guilt. Things could be much worse, but they are still bad and I try to acknowledge that. 

Please be careful though it sounds like you are extremely self aware. We are all just trying to cope in our own ways. I definitely think about drinking a lot more than I did before. 

Work has been keeping me busy unfortunately. I got put onto this project that they decided has a deadline once they put me on it so that's stressing me out. And I'm trying to go back to school and have been trying to prep for that. I'm worried I don't know what I need to to go to the next step. So not fun things, but necessary I guess. I'm taking today and watching Miyazaki movies though. I tried to make bread too. No idea if it's done, but it looks nice. And Reddit. Lots of Reddit. Way more than I ever have done or care to admit now. 

I think kids have life figured out though. They can find the good and magic in anything. So nothing wrong with books and puzzles. Whatever keeps a little bit of fun in life."

NewToReddit,fn5irut,t3_fznq5o,1586665986.0,"During the day, I've been trying to keep busy. Watch a movie, learn how to cook something new, listen to new music, work on something I've been putting off... even if it's just a little, focusing on something I have control of helps and it keeps my mind from worrying. 

I've been exercising using youtube videos before sleeping too. That's been helping me get tired and it's something I can do at home. Yoga is really nice too. 

For sleeping, I close any doors I can see into from my bed so it's not like I'm looking into the black void and I'll play a happy tv show if I'm having trouble sleeping. (It works sometimes. Sometimes it's too much stimulation. I know the light isn't the best for rem too.) It focuses my mind enough so I can fall asleep, but I choose something I've already seen enough that I don't feel like I have to pay attention. That balance makes it easier to sleep. I do parks and rec a lot of times. For the most part, it's evenly paced and there's a lot of talking which makes me feel less separated from everyone else. Asmr and meditation guides are also really helpful if you're into that. 

And nothing wrong with a night light type thing. Could be a small lamp, or a computer, or even just a light... maybe in another room, maybe in the same room. Something comforting until the scared feeling passes. 

This is just what I do so no guarantees it will work, but I hope something does. Good luck."

If you already know this, please ignore. I mean no offense. What are your voice types? Phantom of the Opera actually has a version where the ending is transposed (lower)- the one Emmy Rossum sings- compared to the broadway version (i.e. Sierra Boggess). You should check it out if you really wanted to sing Phantom. Obviously, the movie adaptation is different than Broadway, but you could potentially keep all the lyrics from the Broadway, but do the movie ending. 

Or, in a classic sense, you could transpose everything.

Anxiety,f056gic,t1_f049t9q,1568403272.0,"I did okay? I cried a little bit more, but I was able to get myself together. I did explain what happened, that I was sorry, I knew what XXX was talking about, and that for the future I’d be better. I know my boss is trying to be careful about talking about it, but she really nicely asked if I had a support system and people I could talk to. I feel a little better about it though I am still uneasy. Thank you for all of your advice. It was really helpful!"
