socialanxiety,fonwqgs,t3_g8fy62,1587927978.0,"Are you willing to schedule an intake appointment for a few therapy sessions? That should help you more than peer review as far as an in depth analysis is concerned. Otherwise you are human and therefore have human problems. I highly recommend therapy. I didn't start to get the homework part of therapy until my shit hit the fan, but just going to have a professional hear you out and provide feedback is nice too."
socialanxiety,fonp0c0,t3_g88mu7,1587923672.0,Bruh i've pushed people away out of sheer stress too. I'd advise you not to stress over your noticable symptoms... It doesn't help you. Maybe look up credible some psych stuff on social anxiety. There's a packet called my psychological abcs online that my therapist gave me to help reinforce good behaviors. I'd also advise you to go to therapy on your own when you are old enough and able.
socialanxiety,fonoadp,t3_g89em6,1587923277.0,"I think you are using these descriptions as labels without actually having a definition of what you are going through. Therapy can help with that.  I also have trouble with listening/critically thinking, especially when stressed. I'm a very laid back person but I still push myself and that's where it can get confusing for me because i'll get very busy which is the opposite of how I like to be when I'm going about typical tasks."

It's refreshing to feel like i'm taking steps in the right direction and gaining self understanding. Its worth the time and copay if you find a therapist that you like and is helpful imo."
