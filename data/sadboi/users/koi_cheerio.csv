SuicideWatch,fmziidp,t3_fydr91,1586521456.0,Hey I can relate to that and you've probably heard it alot but it gets easier to deal with idk if it the pain ever goes away but it at least gets easier to deal with at the beginning I could barely breathe but it got better but I'm sorry you had to go through that
SuicideWatch,fmzhpc1,t3_fyenmf,1586520739.0,Hey man I understand sadly too much but hopefully it gets better at least for you (sorry this probably didnt help much but sometimes it helps to know theres similar people)
SuicideWatch,fmzhf0b,t3_fycx7i,1586520475.0,You can try talking through everything with them and explain it I dont have context but that could help
SuicideWatch,fmzhci9,t3_fyddey,1586520409.0,It is important and your not weak to be able to keep going proves that
FullmetalAlchemist,fmrgy7s,t1_fmrgha9,1586322885.0,Yeah she didnt have any real reason to stay besides wanting to help
FullmetalAlchemist,fmrdwml,t1_fmrd2co,1586320425.0,Ig but that was only a theory and they were studying alchehestry tho ig they tried every opportunity they had
FullmetalAlchemist,fmodknr,t3_fwe10e,1586255049.0,In brotherhood it's just van hohenheim
ShingekiNoKyojin,fmoawq5,t3_fw5j83,1586252097.0,Fullmetal brotherhood is at least as good (I'd say better though)

SuicideWatch,flzyop4,t3_fs5fd2,1585638050.0,I get it and deal with alot of the same stuff hopefully it gets better for you though.
OnePiece,flynssp,t1_flxpktm,1585605634.0,He probably will after or during late wano arc
SuicideWatch,flxj8jt,t3_frqpgh,1585583958.0,I'm glad you survived and hope you get better
OnePiece,flxbmhe,t1_flwy60d,1585579623.0,Yeah usually their bounties go up just by association with a yonko crew
OnePiece,flwwtf4,t1_flwwgf9,1585568219.0,O shoot I never really thought deep into that but yeah he shouldve had one specially if he was able to scar shanks
OnePiece,flwvy67,t1_flwvjse,1585567297.0,Ig so but after he gets what he wants and takes down the other yonko he sees as threats to the one piece he'll most likely attack the world government and yeah we dont officially know hos goals yet but we can assume it's to rule the world or spread chaos because he seems to idolize rocks who wanted to rule the world. And yeah for now their not but having a power like that on the world and letting it grow is dangerous.
OnePiece,flwup4l,t1_flwu83q,1585565912.0,"But katakuri is barely a threat to the world government yeah hes a yonkos commander but hes never aimed directly for the world government or navy as far as we know and blackbeard has taken down a yonko , he was a warlord and he has arguably two of the strongest devil fruits. To me the world government should be very afraid of him but his bounty will probably be raised when he does something big again maybe during wano"
SuicideWatch,fkmx3ya,t3_fjgtxr,1584343551.0,I hope it gets better (I know that doesnt help but idk) sorry for not being able to say much

SuicideWatch,fk7e89l,t3_fgvoys,1583934563.0,Hey man that sucks but things will get better and yeah everyone says that but they will and at least you have people that care about you and that's shitty that your friend just cut you out like that and if you dont love your girlfriend you shouldnt lead her on but you should see if you do or not or if you want her but yeah (sorry for basically just saying everything sucks)
SuicideWatch,fk4l3v3,t3_fghqij,1583862582.0,From what you said you did I dont think you can get a std so it should be ok but I'm not a medical professional

SelfHate,fgt2h5n,t1_fgt058e,1581097664.0,Yeah I understand that and I dont know if theres a way to get over it but if she still wants to talk to you you have the opportunity to fix the mistakes and redeem yourself or at least help it
SelfHate,fgsjr5y,t3_f04782,1581086089.0,Hey  this has happened to me to so your not alone and I messed up but you could ask her what those things were and try to stop doing it and you could try to get better
SuicideWatch,fgsje9l,t3_f07gmk,1581085834.0,Hey I'm not one to talk so take my opinion with a grain of salt but someone who hurts you like that isn't worth it even if they did help you
OnePiece,fgnznl9,t1_fgnz316,1580956438.0,Thank you and it would be and itd be cool to see
OnePiece,fgnb9tx,t1_fgnb4tq,1580941255.0,But if he had observation then hed be able to split his body before he got attacked at least in most cases
OnePiece,fgn9rep,t1_fgn9csw,1580940385.0,Yeah then the better word would be to train to unlock it seeing as hes a captain of his crew and most  captain's in the new world have it or at least some of the ones we've seen

SuicideWatch,fewzr0s,t3_eqrqrm,1579421994.0,Hey I know its later and this is probably too late but if it's not theres people that you can talk to
Anger,fevk9fv,t3_eqjhib,1579398374.0,I dont know your story or background but itd help to have someone to talk to and vent to and if you dont have those try to find a way to vent your anger into something like boxing or a hobby that helps and a way to calm yourself before you do something rash but advice cant help as much without background knowledge

pokemon,f7xiqrh,t1_f7xdozh,1574059217.0,Yeah but pokemon is too big of a company with too big of a loyal fanbase to be threated no one does exactly what they do well enough to threaten them.
pokemon,f7xincb,t1_f7xcbl7,1574059108.0,"Yeah they do and that strategy is working, but the fanbase deserves better than just mediocre."
pokemon,f7xijbb,t1_f7xc5jf,1574058978.0,It's not that but the pokemon fanbase is loyal. and the games are good but they dont live up to the Hope's of some of the fanbase.
