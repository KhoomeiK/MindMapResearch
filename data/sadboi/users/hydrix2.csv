GEO enabled means it automatically positions those in the real world based on your coordinates (usually from your mobile device) pretty much exactly the way Pokemon GO works, whereas VR describes a fully immersive experience that completely blocks out the real world"
truegaming,fnul5o5,t3_g3yttm,1587264727.0,"Probably not large scale VR since it's expensive, hard to use, difficult to manage the players physically, takes a long time to set up for new players, impossible to create an ""App Store"" due to lack of technical standards, dangerous... and impossible to test/code for small teams without being on-site

However, I strongly believe that GEO enabled AR will be massive for gaming, video entertainment, and advertisement once a few kinks are figured out like battery life (probably shine something on your eye instead of a LCD) wearability (probably will take the form of glasses of some sort) and some other minor technical issues like scalability

At that point the AR would probably gradually transition to VR for specific areas once some technical standards and programming ecosystems are established, not unlike the evolution of iPhones in recent times

All this is probably less than 10 years away"

The countless times I’ve tried to patiently explain the tech have been met with baseless, childish responses (“PoS is a pie in the sky, can’t shard.” Really? Because it launches in 6 months, both PoS and sharding). There’s also strong evidence to support the idea that the BTC run was manipulated, such as when researchers uncovered that nearly 100 million had been market bought across bot accounts simultaneously at 4200. ETH can’t compete with such volume, and perhaps the bear market needed another year to mature in a natural setting, causing this sentiment to be reflected in altcoins alone."

I'm happy see people pushing forward with the concept regardless and everyone is super hyped.
