depression,fqh3pz5,t3_givy9x,1589366758.0,"Thanks. I try to share but I just feel like I am being a burden to people. Feeling sad all the time. I feel they are getting tired of me too and I understand them. 
Will this ever stop? Does anyone ever gets cured?"
depression,fqcvkwe,t3_gfg4h2,1589270415.0,"I used to do that. I still need a time-out sometimes, like today. I just don't feel like replying so I put up a display picture to call me only if it's urgent. My phone blew up because people don't understand the need for privacy from time to time. I understand that they care but how do I explain it to them that it gets exhausting and I just need some time off. I know I will be normal in a day or two hopefully. 
I hate having depression. Hate feeling this way. I don't want to feel this way anymore."
depression,fpsk2w3,t3_gf6llw,1588874799.0,"I wish that just for one day, i wasn't such a stuck up. ðŸ˜”"
depression,fpr0udg,t1_fpqrtrn,1588838428.0,I used to question it a lot. Why me ? I cried for months but then I had to accept it. Being hopeful was just making me worse. I am sad but at least I don't question it now and relive the cycle.
depression,fpos98n,t3_gemzwi,1588789781.0,I have always had relationships where people leave me for other people. Even my father chose someone else over me. It keeps repeating in my life. I have accepted it now.
depression,fpdn9gf,t3_gcqww5,1588530348.0,I feel the same. I too wasted 25 years of my life because of this. I hate it!
depression,fp9u5qo,t3_gc262i,1588434618.0,"Everything has an end.

 I suddenly had this realisation today."
depression,fp0w7fq,t3_gaipig,1588218314.0,"Just don't. I know any reason that I might give you might seem absurd. I think about it everyday myself. All this pain, things always being the same, always feeling so miserable but what is the guarentee that this will stop after you die? Who knows what happens after you die?

 I know it's not the correct way but I just like to think this way to live "" Just a little more till you die naturally. Complete your time here and you'd be done with it."""
relationships,fome9py,t3_g86few,1587886888.0,"Could be many things.
a. It could be a mental disorder. 
b. May be she is just ashamed of her life and is judging herself too hard. It could be a defense mechanism. She probably thinks everyone else would judge her (even though you don't) because she is being too harsh on herself."
depression,fof2btq,t3_g6yfkt,1587723468.0,I get it but just hold on and go with the flow. This is what I do. I exactly know how it feels :(
depression,fnw1gw0,t3_fvcm3g,1587309488.0,"I have been having depression and GAD for 9 years now. It was always on and off in my case. Somehow I always used to get through but this time after I broke up after 18 days of relationship which sounds so silly, I fell into this pit that I am not able to come out of. It's crazy. If I think rationally, it was so short and the guy isn't that good but still I don't know what has happened to me. I have been crying everyday. Nothing makes me happy. I am always sad. I have lost all hopes. I have now started to think that there is something terribly wrong with me. Maybe I am insane. I don't know for how much long I'll be able to handle this. I just want to be done with it. It's very painful to go through this everyday. Put on a brave face, a smile for everyone else when inside I feel like shit. I want to cry all the time. I don't want to eat or do anything. I have lost the zeal to live and now i have started to think that I'll always be like this. I don't want to feel this way forever. I want to get out of this. Therapy and medicines are also not belping me much. I really don't want to feel this way anymore. It's been 5 months of despair and hopelessness. Every single day is horrible."
