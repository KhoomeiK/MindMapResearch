I really don‚Äôt have sympathy that someone‚Äôs aggression could reach the point that he can break a dogs hip in anger, honestly. he should be nowhere near a dog or a child until he has his emotions under control, and frankly I wouldn‚Äôt trust anybody who hurt my dog ever again.

Now he's pretending to feel guilty. It disturbs me that you thought nothing of your limping dog and your husband joking that he 'fixed the problem'. What the fuck? You know this wasn't your dog jumping off the sofa. It's a ridiculous thought to entertain.

If you don't break up with this man you're doing a disservice to your future children, and you're hurting your poor, tiny dog who is probably terrified of this psychopath - but don't worry. He'll feel bad about it afterwards.

I understand that change is difficult, but this is very possibly the most important decision you're going to make in regard to your future. Break up with him, for your future children and for your poor little dog."
