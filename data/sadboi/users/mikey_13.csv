bipolar,f0r4keh,t1_f0r2ln2,1568873825.0,Yeah and I know your right itâ€™s just been very difficult to walk down that road again but I should start looking into options again.
bipolar,f0r1pjx,t1_f0qzv2h,1568871693.0,"I appreciate you saying that because itâ€™s been rough haha.

Iâ€™m currently not on any medication although I have been on Lithium and Lamictal before as far as for mood stabilizers....I had an issue with being on medication and my doctor, believe it or not, got arrested for overprescribing so I have been doing a lot of research before I go back on anything again due to these circumstances....not that I donâ€™t want help but I want the right kind of help if that makes sense."
bipolar,f0qzem1,t3_d68if1,1568870020.0,And also the paranoia is a little bit off the charts as of late and thatâ€™s also a newer symptom.
bipolar,f0qz7yn,t1_f0qv6bv,1568869893.0,"Yeah the major ones right now are the panic/anxiety, suicidal thoughts, hyperactive, mood swings and restlessness. I tend to cycle about 2 or 3 times a month which seems crazy to me but like I said Iâ€™ve been dealing with this for a while and Iâ€™m actively tracking and logging how Iâ€™ve been feeling as a way of managing it."
bipolar,eyrf5co,t3_cyaiaa,1567367029.0,Wow that is some real facts ðŸ˜‚
bipolar,ey34bge,t1_ey30o84,1566755036.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to reply! I appreciate your advice and I think thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to start doing. I should be seeking out a new psychiatrist itâ€™s just been taking me a while to get over all the past experiences Iâ€™ve had with it before.
bipolar,ey2y56t,t3_cva02w,1566750864.0,"Lamictal did help for me, at least a little. I definitely noticed it decreased the anxiety overall that I would get. However I was put on it as a mood stabilizer and it really didnâ€™t help as much in that regard.

Hope this helps!"
