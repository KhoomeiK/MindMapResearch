medical_advice,fr4bwf3,t3_gmdz8h,1589883117.0,"Hi. 

I don’t know a lot about cysts specifically but a pancreatic mass is often malignant. 

Pancreatic cancer interferes with the body’s production of digestive enzymes and may be related to sudden unexpected weight loss. 

Surgical removal of the pancreatic tail is possible a however they can’t remove the whole thing; pancreatic cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy. The long term prognosis is not good.

I hope that this cyst/mass turn out to be benign.
Best of luck to your dad. I hope you get some answers soon.

Perhaps I could have written, ‘Sudden rise in cases in Singapore; despite Singapore using an approach to Coronavirus (detect, isolate, trace) that was adapted by the Australian government based on what now is emerging in the data as early success in spread suppression that has not effectively avoided an exponential surge in cases and as such perhaps we need consider how the emergence of a delayed but intense rises in COVID19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks may bear relevance to our trajectory in coming weeks given that we have just entered a period of virus suppression using this same approach. 

Seemed a bit wordy for the title of a reddit thread though. Discussion seems relevant to me from an epidemiological perspective, but yeah ... apologies for pathetic use of term emulate in title."
CoronavirusDownunder,fo2pah9,t1_fo2oh8f,1587470424.0,"Yes, they were published in trash media weeks ago when our government was saying in press conferences and so forth that they would be modelling the response on the the same identification, isolation and tracking approach that had been so successful in Singapore. You asked where I got the idea we were working off this model. These were a couple of quick examples. 

Now there is push for an app, again modelled from Singapore’s approach. 

Yet even with this same plan of containment (and Singapore already having a pandemic plan in place) they (Singapore) have seen exponential growth in case numbers over the last week or two. 

I feel that we should - as a nation, albeit one with a lot less population density - pay attention to this and perhaps consider that we need to be very bloody careful that this doesn’t get away from us.

Low numbers in Aus over the last week is excellent but let’s look at the example of where this same strategy has been employed already. It’s important not to dismiss this Singaporean increase as something that could not happen o us.

Let’s not get complacent here."

australia,fnu0rvd,t1_fntswja,1587252312.0,"It makes sense to do some elective surgery, but it does not make sense for a consultant, a fellow a registrar, an anaesthetist, an anaesthetic nurse, a scrub nurse and a scout nurse to all use PPE (so many masks, gloves, gowns) and expose themselves to aerosols from intubation of a ‘healthy’ cat 2 or 3 elective patient (who may be an asymptomatic carrier of COVID) to do something like a non urgent no strangulated hernia repair, or a gastric sleeve etc.

We probably should start doing more of the ‘urgent’ cat 2s than we have been to minimise them turning into cat 1s, but at the same time we need to be careful not to use resources such as PPE unscrupulously."
