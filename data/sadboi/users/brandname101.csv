offmychest,fqggfh4,t1_fqfx8x1,1589345618.0,"Yes tools are important in coping with mental illnesses. If it’s really getting in the way of your life, therapists will suggest medication. So I agree therapists can give tools and resources to clients to help them understand themselves and their issues better. However it’s known you should never work harder than your client, you should always meet them where they’re at. Otherwise advice won’t work if clients aren’t ready. Even therapists who specialize in CBT, DBT give clients tools and options but I was taught that giving advice to clients can backfire. Instead of advice a good therapist will reflect on clients words and thoughts they said before about the problem they are having by reflecting. At that point a client can start seeing solutions for themselves, because after all what makes sense to you might not make sense to them. We all live differently and believe in our own right way of living. People are responsible for their own emotions. I’ve seen therapists in the past when I asked for advice they don’t give it to me, they give me tools and suggestions but if they do somehow give me advice it’s really coming from me. I want to go to therapy to feel confident in myself to make my own decisions not to depend on other people to solve all my issues because that’s not realistic. Clients are capable of making their own decisions if you give them the right tools and reflect back to them of what their needs and wants are."
offmychest,fqct524,t1_fqan4gi,1589268069.0,"Therapists can give out suggestions but the best ones give clients tools that help guide them to make their own decisions. Have you ever listened to your friends advice? No, because it doesn’t work. A great therapist helps you understand your thoughts and behavior and validates your feelings. Honestly its all about what works for you and if you get along with your therapist. People are experts of their own lives but when you are suffering it’s hard to make any decision. People want to be listened to and have their feelings validated. When you’re down the last thing you want to hear is advice it makes you feel ignored. You want to feel empowered and independent to make your own decisions."

offmychest,fq7zjo7,t1_fq7obq3,1589155435.0,A good therapist never gives advice so if that therapist is giving you advice you probably want to see a different. If you choose to take that therapists advice but it bites you afterwards who will take responsibility for it? You will be the one living with that decision not your fucking therapist. A therapist should mostly listen and ask questions to help explore different ideas and help you to figure out what you want to do with your life.

Nope it actually made me get fired from 2 jobs and made me do things without thinking. I was also young but still. Sorry Im just speaking from my horrible experience. I am on the bipolar spectrum and have more rapid cycling I never actually been in a manic state but the first time I was diagnosed this psychiatrist made me take so many pills and high dose of lithium for someone who was suffering from bipolar 1 when I wasn’t.

nocontact,fpexm6q,t1_fpex3kh,1588557149.0,"If she is still with him then I mean there’s your answer. Sometimes even with someone new there’s things we miss that we had with our exes that we don’t with the person we are with now. Nows the time to just work on yourself. Some people have attachment issues that they just need to be with someone all the time and honestly those are the people who aren’t really happy in my opinion, because they will settle for anyone who shows them any sort of love or affection towards them. They rather be miserable with someone than be alone. Look being alone sucks no doubt about that, but being with someone yet feeling alone is much much worse."

nocontact,fpewpxm,t3_gd1p1l,1588556599.0,Just because she cheated doesn’t mean she doesn’t feel bad or doesn’t miss you. Time apart makes you miss the good times and makes your realize what you didn’t appreciate about the other person. Depending on the reason she cheated on you she probably misses you and wonders what you’re up to in your life. I’m sure you two had some sort of love and history before she cheated.

But yea I don’t know  it takes me a long time to get over a break up even when I broke up with them. I do feel unloveable and think that there’s no right person for me. It just takes time I hope one day I look back and I will be grateful that we broke up that day just isn’t today. But usually I look back at my other exes and im so glad Im not with them anymore.
bipolar2,fpcerub,t3_gce6p3,1588497831.0,I just started taking lamictal I still feel like myself but calmer and maybe I listen more too. Umm that is one of my biggest worries tho once I start taking a higher dose it will flatten me out. That’s why I havent been on meds for 15 years because im scared of that and also scared of withdrawals from meds. But I read good things about this med about not changing who you are but we will see. If it does Im going to stop it and just live with my mental illness as is.
BreakUps,fpcegvk,t3_gcgnqz,1588497495.0,Yep in the same boat. I went to counseling for help and also talk to my friends which helps. Some days it’s easier others Im miserable.

Usually once I find out my exes are with someone it helps me move on faster because I don’t want anything to do with them afterwards but this time around it’s tougher because of how much feelings I have for my ex.
