BPD,fquwnty,t3_gl238n,1589665675.0,"College isn’t for everyone, but if your university is supportive and you‘re committed to learning, I think it’s 100% worth it. Don’t let BPD hold you back. Go for it!

I go to school in the US, so things might be a bit different, but I know a lot of us have had non-traditional college experiences. It’s still possible to be successful! You may need to adjust your expectations, though. For instance, I initially thought I was gonna finish in 4 years...but that sure as hell isnt gonna happen haha

Here’s some “non-traditional” things that’ve helped me succeed (again, some might not apply):

-When I had to drop out 4 weeks into my first semester, I was able to petition to “retroactively withdrawal” from classes and get my money back as if I dropped out on the first day of school. I just had to provide supporting documentation along with my personal statement.

-I’m also registered with my schools disability services office and receive a ton of accommodations. DM me if you’re interested in the full list. Tbh, I couldn’t do school without these.

-I’ve taken “incompletes”, which means I finish classes after the semester is scheduled to end. It’s not ideal, but if something comes up and I’m most of the way through the class, then I just work with the instructor at my own pace to finish. 

-Living alone: Among various doctors notes, my psych doctor and neurologist wrote notes advocating for me to have a single dorm room. This was helpful.

-Summer classes: pretty self-explanatory. There’s wayyy less people.

-Going part-time: I know it’s cliche, but the most important point I can make is that it’s not a race. Take your time. I’ve ended up setting myself back further when I’ve tried to “stay on schedule” by pushing myself too hard. It’s not worth it.

If you really want to go to school and have the right supports then I truly believe you can do it! Best of luck, friend! <3

I always describe it to my therapist as “falling in love” with strangers. It happens quickly, intensely, and frequently. Sometimes it’s the first time I meet a guy.

My therapist tries to help me focus on what’s effective in the moment, rather than getting caught up in pathologizing my behavior. 

Do I catch feelings quicker than most people? You bet. Do I feel more strongly toward my FWB than he does toward me? Almost definitely. That said, sometimes it’s helpful for me to reach out to guys when other coping skills aren’t working and I’m at risk of a more harmful problem behavior or suicide attempt. 

Importantly, this choice requires me to cope ahead for when I’m no longer with the guy and I inevitably feel lonely. So there’s some pro/con thinking that goes into it, but it’s all about harm reduction when considering each unique situation.

Here’s the best advice I can offer:
Try your best not to get caught up in labels/diagnoses right now. These categories are pretty arbitrary anyway and getting treatment for the painful symptoms you’re experiencing is ultimately what’s most important, right?

This brings me to my next (and most important) point: Please reach our for professional help. Importantly, help-seeking is healthy and is not—I repeat, NOT—the same thing as attention-seeking. 

I saw you wrote that you didn’t think getting treatment is an option. I’d challenge this. Granted, I know it’s more difficult because your a minor, but it’s not impossible. I‘ve been there. I remember the days of adolescent mental illness. Unfortunately, my parents weren’t much help, and it sucked.

If you don’t feel comfortable talking with your parents or you don’t think they’ll be receptive to talking about mental health, then please talk to a counselor at school or another trusted adult. I know it’s not easy, but it’s really important. I can’t stress that enough.

Sometimes I think a PD diagnostic label does more harm than good.

Many of us are used to seeing therapists and other providers regularly in-person, but many others have limited access to care (like disabled people and those in rural areas, among others).

I'm not gonna lie...I'm nervous about it. Tomorrow's my first video call appt with my therapist.

As for textbooks, my university disability services office provides me with accessible media (pdf format textbooks) for my classes.

If you're interested, here's how to [have a mac speak text that's on the screen](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/have-your-mac-speak-text-thats-on-the-screen-mh27448/mac). You can also [listen to Word docs with the Read Aloud feature.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/listen-to-your-word-documents-with-read-aloud-967a1533-4ba3-4e84-8ddc-132b1564434f) I'm not well-versed with windows, maybe someone else can chime in here? 

As for writing, I've struggled with that before too at times when I'm not at my cognitive best. Dictation was more helpful for me than typing—obviously only in the times when I was able to form words and in a private space tho. I've used both [general mac dictation](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-dictation-mh40584/mac) and [microsoft word dictation](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/dictate-your-documents-d4fd296e-8f15-4168-afec-1f95b13a6408).

Dissociation sucks. Keep up the good work! <3"
BPD,fadxxv3,t1_fad641s,1575989197.0,"Sorry, I didn’t understand you meant you had another Reddit account (in new here).

I agree with you, it sounds like a good idea to start away for a little longer. It didn’t mean to imply you could fix anything—it doesn’t sound like health issues are in your control. I meant that sometimes things can cool off a bit, like you said. If even from a 10 to a 9. Like maybe you manage to get some more sleep or something then you can confront this. 

Also, idk if this is relevant/helpful or not but sometimes I ask my bf to spare me triggering things. He’s glad to. He’s weird and likes reading things like the fb posts of people we hate. But if he wants to tell me something I just ask he does it objectively. If this happened to me I’d wait until I cooled off a bit, but then also ask him to read through and clear out any messages for me bc it still sounds pretty triggering. Ofc this depends on your comfortably with asking for help, but i hope it’s at least something to consider.

Keep up the good work! I’m rooting for you!"

BPD,fad5ruh,t3_e8lyqi,1575956429.0,"I’m sorry things have been so difficult recently. It sounds like you have a lot to manage rn. In light of that, it makes sense that rejection / negative responses could put you over the edge.

It sounds like that subreddit may be a trigger rn. Could you try mentally boxing that up and setting it aside until you’re able to cope through some of the more pressing things you have going on atm? I imagine it’s not easy. At the same time, you don’t want to return to the subreddit too soon and be triggered to sh again, right?

Please take care & reach out to healthy supports <3"
BPD,facawdb,t1_fabwobp,1575936282.0,"Same here! When I was 18 I’d always think I was 16 and now I’m 20 always thinking I’m 18. What is it with 2 years? 

Maybe it’s like writing the date after the new year where it takes you a while to get a feel for it...except it just takes us ABSURDly long to acclimate to our new year of age."
OSU,fa6gqpx,t1_fa3e1o6,1575824561.0,"OP, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with you!

It’s called dissonant cognition. We all have it. Sometimes we put off doing things because they’re important to us and it’s hard to get started! If you want to make change, try not to beat yourself up so much. If not, that’s okay too. There’s always a reason for not being ‘productive’ and it’s not that we’re lazy or don’t give a heck. Guilt isn’t the best motivator in the grand scheme of things. Take it easy, my friend.

We got this!"
BPD,fa66wxf,t3_e7qtq2,1575821664.0,"Yep!

For me I think it’s the dissociation kicking in like ‘you felt too much just then bro...lets take it down a notch or eighty-seven until you don’t know what an emotion is’"
BPD,fa1rflo,t3_e7jmde,1575773440.0,"I haven’t found meds helpful for mood so I’m not the best person to ask about that part.

As for side effects: I’ve had hair loss. It’s allegedly rare tho and it prob doesn’t help that I’m not well nourished to begin with. I’m also on Topamax which makes it worse, but I’ve been on just Lamictal before and still had minor hair loss. It stopped when I got off it. (fyi: currently on 50mg Lamictal & 150 mg Topamax)

Wishing you the best!"
BPD,f9zxds9,t3_e7he2u,1575746408.0,"It’s a great question that doesn’t have an easy answer. So far I’ve found that whether we like it or not, cluster b people have a tendency to be drawn to one another.

If you’re interested in “professional opinions” here’s like the only article on the subject:
[Mixing oil and water: Couples with personality disorders](https://www.apa.org/monitor/mar04/mixing)
It has lots of further reading in the references too"
