AskReddit,fimv1gf,t3_f8ns1x,1582547916.0,I'm late but once me and my friend where on our way out of school when we saw that a music classroom was open so we quickly glanced inside and for a split second I saw a dark figure of a really tall man. Later I asked my friend if she also saw that dude and she said she did as well. Next day my friend said she had a nightmare about a tall dude following her but idk how true that is.
