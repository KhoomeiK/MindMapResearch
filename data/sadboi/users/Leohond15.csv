relationship_advice,fr562m9,t1_fr50z5q,1589903144.0,"> I wouldn't call wanting to raise a kid greedy, they didn't know the situation of the kid they adopted when they wanted to adopt. Are all people who adopt greedy in that sense?

The greedy part isn't wanting to adopt a child. The greedy part is thinking their ""claim"" on her was more important or valid than her bio father's. So much so that they not only banned him from having a relationship with his child, but LIED about him saying he abandoned her for her entire life. This is greedy and wrong. 

Additionally, even if the dad was a foolish young man who perhaps had a one night stand, that doesn't mean he'd be a poor father. But the fact that he knew information about the mom like she loved her OP, didn't want to give her up, and her parents forced her to put her up for adoption, this leads me to believe this was likely some sort of teen/young adult relationship where he was also banned from his gf and THAT is why he didn't know about his baby. I would bet all my money the OP's maternal grandparents purposely made sure he didn't find out about her because they didn't want him to file for custody. Considering the fact that many young men in these situations also don't file for custody or even give a shit, I think it's evidence he was a stand up guy, and still is. Even if he was perhaps not very well off financially or educated, that sounds like it may have been better than the adoptive parents treating the OP badly."
relationship_advice,fr55gkq,t1_fr4u0b2,1589902837.0,"You don't have to keep a relationship with anyone because they adopted (or even gave birth!) to you when they treat you like shit. Additionally, while other adoptees might struggle with the thought of ""well if they didn't adopt me I'd have been in a terrible situation, so I owe them"". Aside from the fact adoptees don't OWE their parents anything (they signed up for you, that's not a debt to be paid, that's just what signing up to be a parent is--caring for another human being for life!), you especially don't owe them anything. If you HADN'T been with them, you'd have still been raised by a loving father. One that honestly sounds like a better parent than them. Idk what the rest of your childhood was like but it sounds like your adoptive dad was an angry, frightening person. Adoption should be done because you want to give a child a loving home, not a consolation prize because you can't spawn your own. Their very selfish decisions were all clearly fueled by the latter."

I disagree. I do not think they feel guilty at all. If they felt guilty they'd apologize and be kinder. They're ANGRY. They're angry that she's ruining the family they wanted (that didn't involve her bio father), and that she wants a relationship with them and has also discovered how horrible they've been to him and her for the past 2 decades."
relationship_advice,fr54w1m,t3_gmoulm,1589902552.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you. Like some others have said it sounds like your adoptive family has been controlling and abusive. 

You definitely need therapy. But along with that, you need to tell them that you will not talk to them until they treat you kindly. They DID keep you from a relationship with him in a very cruel way. Even if they insisted on custody, they could have allowed him to have a relationship with you as an uncle of sorts--this is actually really common with birth mothers anyway. Why not with the birth father too? 

Tell them that you are going to have a relationship with your bio father, whether they like it or not. He loves you, he's always loved you. Let them know that your desire for your birth parents was never a rejection of them but rather a natural thing adopted kids feel. THEY caused the problems by not only insisting you have no relationship with him but lying to you, even after you'd literally found him. Tell them you want to have a relationship with EVERYONE in your family, but if they decide they would like to spend your time together making you feel terrible, you won't talk to them very much because you won't tolerate that behavior. 

Again, I'm very sorry this happened to you. Please make firm boundaries with your bio parents and enjoy every minute of building a relationship with your newfound father."

You fully admit you don't think before you speak, and it sounds like you're rude and have a tendency to talk down about people. That doesn't sound like the sister being negative, that sounds like someone (and someone younger!) calling you out on juvenile mean-girl behavior. I'll admit not taking prescribed meds is not good, and this may mean she's troubled otherwise, but this example is not putting her in a bad light at all. 

As for the older sister, there's no way I believe she dislikes you because she is a 33 yr old single mom. She dislikes you because you are invalidating her understandable feelings of wanting her partner to marry her. Did she even ask for advice? Because it's none of your business and her being upset about this seems pretty reasonable to me as someone much closer to her age. 

The problem is you. You sound obnoxious and immature, and I can understand why his sisters don't like you. You may be trying to be nice, but I think you need to understand that giving unwanted advice and making thoughtless comments isn't a good way to endear yourself to his sisters. You need to re-evaluate your actions. People who call themselves ""positive"" and others ""negative"" are often people who haven't ever experienced any personal struggles (such as single motherhood or depression) or just try to force their brand of optimism and outlook on life on others who don't want it. I've been called negative, but I'm not. I'm a realist who has experienced trauma and is just a quiet person who can behave seriously and enjoys very dark humor. You would drive me absolutely crazy.

Additionally, if your daughter is considering adoption, your wife's opinion doesn't and shouldn't matter. It should be up to your daughter and the father of her child. You need to tell your daughter that she can and should put her kid up for adoption if she wants to, even if her mom doesn't, and tell your wife that if your daughter is pressured to keep her child when she doesn't want to that will seriously fuck up the kid and your daughter's life. Trust me, most of the people I know whose parents ""almost"" put them up for adoption were terrible mothers and treated their kids badly. 

Your wife and daughter don't need to see eye to eye, but she has to start being decent to her. She also needs to stop being petty that she enjoys things like fishing and football instead of gymnastics and piano.

Ahhh. This actually makes COMPLETE sense and literally the same thing happened to that ex I referred to. She came out to her parents not once, but TWICE as a young teen but of course they also said she was too young to know. 

They aren't shocked in the sense of ""They didn't see it coming"". They're upset that their attempts to force you to be straight and repress your sexuality haven't worked. I don't know if they were ever very controlling before, but this is part of the increase. Also, it doesn't sound like there are religious objections but maybe see if you can talk to them about this.

relationship_advice,fqqaz5o,t3_gkc7ty,1589562405.0,"This is sticky. It's clear from your description that he's called his parents out on this and told them they're wrong--and at least his mom responded somewhat positively. However the fact he is accusing you of ""hating"" them is troubling. They have given you 0 reason to be comfortable around them. You need to reiterate to him that there's a difference between hating someone, and being massively uncomfortable around people who ARE literally saying and spreading hateful, bigoted messages about people like you. Remind him you've previously been social with them but now you're struggling with this and you don't like engaging with them because of their bigoted actions. 

You need to be blunt and tell him that his parents' racism and his trying to force you to be around them is literally making you question the wedding, and that. Honestly, his reaction is all that I would consider important. I'm gay so used to being hated by a partner's family, but the thing that matters is your partner's reaction. And his sounds pretty wishy-washy. His parents need to change this behavior, or else a marriage and family connected to them is just not viable."
relationship_advice,fqq8aff,t1_fqq5l45,1589561103.0,"Yeah, I really feel foolish not addressing the coming out thing earlier because you'd said they just started acting like this because of that. A lot of times parents aren't ok with it, but they pretend they are--both because they legit don't want to hurt their kid and because they're ashamed of it. 

I had an experience like that with a gf whose parents HATED me, or well, her mom did at least. There was no legit reason to hate me other than I was a woman and not wealthy. Her mom constantly claimed how she was ok with it, but it was so clear by unsaid actions (trying to stop her from seeing me, getting her very heteronormative gifts, etc.) that she wasn't. And when we finally broke up after a year? She literally thought she was going to start dating men. 

So I do actually think this is worth addressing too. Let them know you understand that this is a shock and they might be struggling with the reality of it. If your parents never suspected it either, like if you're very femme, may also make it harder. They may be mourning the life they envisioned for you, and even feel like their image of you is wrong.

Write out an email to your parents (you want to get out everything without interruptions). Tell them that you love them, and you want a relationship with them but the parameters of your relationship MUST stop. You are a grown woman and they are treating you like a child, and need to stop micromanaging you. You are successfully supporting yourself in your job, and therefore their input is not necessary. The constant contact needs to stop. Say a number of times you love them and will be willing to facetime once a day (esp during quarantine) but it's not right for them to guilt you or act like you don't love them when you're simply an adult living your own life. You will also not tolerate any insults to your gf. It's ok if they're not a big fan of her but you won't listen to a barrage of criticism. Tell them these are going to be the new parameters of your relatinoship with them as an ADULT, and while you know it's hard, they need to get used to it. Tell them that you will be willing to talk about this with them but if they start trying to tell you how horrible you are or change these rules. If they do, you will politely hang up. 

They will NOT respond well to this. They will guilt you, tell you that you are horrible, cry, harass you. They will try to force you to apologize. DON'T. DON'T answer them. Also, as someone else said if this has just started/coincided with them finding out you're gay it is likely that has a big part of it. Find a PFLAG group near them and tell them to go.

It's horribly manipulative, toxic and wrong that they seem to have ""claimed"" you for your entire life as ""Her"" friend. 

You need to distance yourself from her and let her and her parents know that this is not how life works. This is not how friendships work. She cannot just claim you and tell you things to do or not do. Her parents are doing her a massive disservice not teaching her appropriate social skills, and while I understand she needed something done about the bullying, having a full time babysitter for a 16 year old who acts as though she's running a bible class for 8 year olds is ridiculous and going to exacerbate the problem of no one liking this girl.

I think you need some therapy if you're not in it now. Right now you can only see yourself surviving in a type of life you've literally never lived before. Have you ever lived alone? Have you ever cared for even one dog of your own? A lot of times we envision ourselves doing something that sounds awesome but we've never actually done it. 

I really do think you should make dogs a bigger part of your life, like my suggestion of looking into working and volunteering with dogs. But more than that, you also need to learn how to have relationships with people as well. Dogs CAN help you feel good, happy, and less isolated but...a relationship with a dog is never like a relationship with a person. And I think you really need those too. Who knows, maybe may end up in a house with a lot of dogs and a partner or family too in the future."
relationship_advice,fqocq58,t3_gk178s,1589512325.0,"I'm a dog trainer and also friends with lots of dog people, as well as having a background in human psychology. 

Living alone with dogs can be satisfying, but it takes a certain kind of person to do it. It's only healthy because you truly want to just be with the dogs. Dogs are not a substitute for people, and people who use dogs (especially the idea of ""a lot of dogs"") because they are isolated and depressed, end up being hoarders and directly or indirectly committing animal cruelty. 

My advice is to stop the idea of buying an isolated house, because that's dangerous for someone already isolated and depressed. However, dogs CAN be such a great way to help depression and get out there and make friends. 

Go volunteer at the local animal shelter. Consider taking a dog training course. Then use those skills and make friends with people who are also really into dogs. It's actually really common for lots of people who work with or spend most of their lives with animals to have struggles with mental health or trauma, so you can find a lot of kindred spirits there. 

So I definitely think dogs can help pull you out of depression and help you live a happier life, but not in a remote house with a dozen dogs."
relationship_advice,fqobm9g,t3_gjy920,1589511646.0,"I'm sorry you went through this as it's really jarring and upsetting. But I think you need to consider a few things too. One is that any choice you make is ok, as long as you're not cruel. Another is that this isn't like another ""lie"", trans people are often completely and totally disregarded because of that status they can't ever date or find love. 

It's reasonable if you can't carry on a physical relationship (esp if he doesn't plan to get bottom surgery--a lot of trans guys don't), but if he's a relaly great guy otherwise could you maybe be ok with it? Maybe not, and that's ok. But I think the kids thing is something that you need to realize can happen even with a cis guy--you may also fall in love with a man who is sterile and can't have bio kids. 

I think you should tell him right now you need to think about this. Then talk to people who have trans partners and will understand your feelings. They would give you a better idea of what being with someone like this will be like to be with a transguy. It will give you a clearer picture on whether or not you feel like you can carry on this relationship with him.
