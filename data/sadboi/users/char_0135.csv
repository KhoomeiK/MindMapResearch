mentalillness,fr2dsjb,t3_gm9lg3,1589835555.0,"Damn they can’t make up their minds. And what does ‘don’t get raped’ even mean, like excuse me? How exactly do we do that, I’d love to know."
Crushes,fr2djhq,t3_gm9pjs,1589835432.0,Aww that’s so sweet! I hope thing go well/continue to go well for you
mentalillness,fpl0hkj,t3_ge2173,1588704216.0,"I do the same exact thing. I can’t for the life of me figure out why, but my best guess is that I want a reason for my mental illnesses to be valid in the eyes of others."
mentalillness,fpl0895,t3_ge291f,1588704089.0,My mental health pushed my partner away. He couldn’t deal with the lows.
Crushes,fpl024d,t3_ge3de0,1588704004.0,"I would ask her for clarification, like a text saying “hey, I can’t stop wondering, was that you rejecting me when I asked you out or do you really just want to focus on your studies?” Just so you know exactly where you stand."
Crushes,fp47ejr,t1_fp17yfe,1588293179.0,Thank you but it’s ok :) just a little sad
Crushes,fp03hcw,t3_gaigsa,1588201784.0,"No, just please don’t lead them both on. It really ends up a big mess and hurting people."
mentalillness,foah9l8,t1_fo9pe8p,1587646481.0,"Trust me, I’m not turning them away or scoffing at them. I want everyone to be happy. And im not necessarily talking about the pandemic. Yes, a LOT of people will probably suffer from this pandemic mentally. And I promise I’m not trying to gate keep, but come on, do you really need to take a mirror selfie with your tongue sticking out while you’re crying and post it on Instagram with the caption I’m depressed?"
mentalillness,foag2y8,t1_foacxhw,1587645997.0,Yeah I have. I’ve been clean for a few weeks but I really feel like I need the pain sometimes. I know that sounds strange but something about the pain makes me feel better.
mentalillness,foafv0h,t1_fo9tidz,1587645894.0,"I totally understand what you’re saying and I’d help anyone who would come to me for help, but I’m talking about the people who do the peace sign-tongue sticking out during crying picks and then post it on insta saying how they got rejected and are so depressed. I really do want everyone to be happy, especially the people I know."
mentalillness,foaf0ue,t1_fo8mdsp,1587645557.0,"I know, I’m sorry. I’m not trying to gate keep, it just really bothers me when people pretend to be depressed for clout or something. And I really have no right to judge other people’s situations, but when you’re surrounded by a bunch of teenagers who say they’re depressed after they got rejected and then say they’re not depressed again later that day, it’s sorta frustrating."
mentalillness,fo8h7rc,t3_g66vw4,1587596493.0,"I do the exact same thing. I sometimes fantasize about killing myself and then imagining how people would react. A whole bunch of messed up scenarios happen in my head at night. Idk if it’s healthy or not, but you’re definitely not alone."
mentalillness,fo8gndd,t3_g62l70,1587596186.0,"Please don’t go yet. Message me and rant, I’ll listen to everything. If no one else cares, I will. I know what it feels like to have no one. Please. I’ll be your friend if you need one. But please, one more day."
mentalillness,fo8g6z9,t3_g69ugp,1587595938.0,"That was really amazing! I know you probably hear this all the time but stay strong. (And keep writing if you’re motivated, because this is super good)"
mentalillness,fo8fhcu,t1_fo83aa0,1587595552.0,I totally get the feeling numb. I’ve been taking some meds and they’ve helped me feel a little more emotion and energized. I hope you find something that works!
Crushes,fo8f7f1,t1_fo84i65,1587595403.0,Thank you!
Crushes,fo7zav2,t3_g5n7x2,1587587130.0,I’d give it some time. Maybe she was busy or has bad cell service or something. If she doesn’t answer in a few days there’s no harm in texting again :)
Crushes,fo7xx3y,t1_fo6z43z,1587586440.0,I beg you don’t lead them all on at once. Someone did that to me very recently and it absolutely destroyed me
Crushes,fo7xfys,t3_g64kkq,1587586206.0,Same thing happened to me very recently. My advice: cut her out completely. Focus on you. I hope you feel better :)
Crushes,fm8c67w,t1_fm82gqj,1585846711.0,Thank you. I already feel a lot better after just doing that
Crushes,fepm0do,t3_eq97n0,1579324039.0,"When I see them looking at me, and I look down, but they keep looking at me. Ughh my heart"
Crushes,fe4p11z,t1_fe10tf3,1578861540.0,I’m glad I can help :) Your crush sounds like a super person
Crushes,fe4ok7d,t1_fe00s1b,1578861398.0,"I’m not 100% sure how to help, but just follow your gut. If you feel like you want to be around her and she makes you happy, just go for it!

And as for mine, I’ve been trying to drop hints, so we’ll see how things turn out. :)"
Crushes,fcsr588,t1_fcsr2ie,1577923009.0,Thanks :)
Crushes,fcsr0it,t1_fcsqp3j,1577922914.0,"Yeah, but he’s also one of my best friends, so I’d rather just stay friends than ruin things. I’m also too afraid to make the first move."
Crushes,fcspygq,t1_fcsoubz,1577922157.0,"The first time it was after I apologized too much, the second time was when he thought I was mad at him, the third and fourth time he just randomly brought it up"
Crushes,fck3sj3,t3_eheskg,1577715743.0,"I have two ideas. Maybe you didn’t fully get the point across that the feelings were mutual? She might be uncomfortable because she thinks that you don’t like her back or because she feels like she was the only one that confessed. She also might be trying to tone it down if you didn’t get the point across to not make you uncomfortable and shove her feelings in your face. My second idea is to be careful. I’m not saying that this is what’s going on, but there is a small chance she’s messing with your feelings. If she’s ‘not feeling it’ one day, but is another, then I don’t think she really likes you. 99.9% of people’s emotions DONT change about a person from day to day. So if there is a possibility this is the case, be careful. Hope this helps! :)"
Crushes,fbwmfup,t1_fbwc6fh,1577153772.0,Thank you. I guess I am stressing over it a little too much :)
