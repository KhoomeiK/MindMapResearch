relationship_advice,fj2y3dv,t3_fb0bsu,1582958332.0,"About 5 to 6 years ago, I was best friends with a former fwb. He and I had no romantic feelings for each other after we stopped hooking up but became ""besties"". His mum adored me n I'd spend so much time with him n his family. When he started dating his current girlfriend a few years ago, I came to realise how uncomfortable it made her. (Although my boyfriend was super cool with it). Initially I tried a lot to be friends with her and make it clear that he's more like a brother to me now n I care way more about my relationship with his mum (thanks to my garbage childhood) than with him. I told her I'd clarify anything for her n be very respectful of their relationship. Slowly but steadily when I understood that she'd never be cool with this even in a ""friends who casually meet in a group setting way"", I started removing myself from that scenario. Now, years later I barely talk to my friend but the girl n I are on good terms n text occasionally. 

My point is, whatever the girl is trying to do - she's clearly manipulating your husband, has absolutely no respect for your marriage and is trying to be a priority to him without you. You need to talk to you husband and you really shouldn't be a second thought in this scenario. If anything she has to put in the work to be friends with you instead of trying to reject your kindness"
relationship_advice,fir21km,t3_f93p8d,1582655806.0,"Even if you give him the benefit of the doubt n assume he really thinks it was a joke, his response to you should have changed later when he realised how much it affected you. He should have apologised regardless cuz you felt threatened when he did that. I think that's a major problem here n you should definitely take measures to improve your safety. 
You could write down exactly how you felt n show it to him n see if he comes to a realisation. But you definitely need to up your safety."

relationships,fi49f6f,t3_f6cosi,1582136631.0,"First of all, I think it's pretty great how understanding of him you are! I'm an Asian woman with a white boyfriend. My family has very strict beliefs that I don't relate to n honestly my boyfriend has been so freaking understanding without me having to explain in many cases. Just thinking about interacting with my family about my relationship causes anxiety. But I've now learned to keep them at a length where we both respect each others beliefs yet do not interfere as much. Even though he isn't conservative, the beliefs his parents had n raised him with, will be in some corner of his mind making him feel guilty. 
I honestly don't know how well your interaction with his family will be. But I can to you for sure, as long as you and your boyfriend are a team, you can get through this. Try to be respectful (like you already mentioned on your post) to them n if they do not reciprocate it, you can distance yourself from them. Good luck!"

I (female) always had a hard time expressing my emotions but I truly respected him for being so vulnerable and in terms with his emotional side.
