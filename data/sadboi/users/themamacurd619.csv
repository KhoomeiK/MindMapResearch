My last dose was Saturday, about 4:30pm. 4.62 grams. It was the third dose of the day. I was ok for an hour. Then I just got IRRITATED. Opening a box of chlorine was too hard. My kids voices were driving me nuts. I turned on a fan to tune them out. Then I got depressed and mopey. I didn't dose yesterday. I didn't get out of bed I was so depressed. I cried off and on all day. Then last night I took Benedryl for sleep (I have Farmapram, but don't like to take it too often) and restless legs kicked in. I didn't sleep until about 3am-ish.

All day long, restless legs. I tried everything. Vick's chest rub, Epsom salt compress, I ordered Hyland's RLS tablets. I normally take magnesium regularly but I'm out so I ordered more and took that. NOTHING worked. So far this is the only WD symptom I've had. I was out in the yard earlier and realized I have mosquito bites!!!!! Tis the season!!!! 

I realized I can't handle mosquito bites on top of RLS, on top of going to work on Wednesday....so I just took about 3.3 grams about 30 minutes ago. My RLS has slightly subsided.
