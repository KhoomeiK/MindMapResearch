Salvia,fr5irac,t1_fr5imzf,1589909228.0,Yeah. I wanted to try.
Salvia,fr54b83,t1_fr2557y,1589902258.0,"I tried it again because I was curious and I get it now. i dont think I breakthrough but whatever happened was incredibly amazing and terrifying. I knew I had to let myself experience it. We are the zipper, we are the tearing, this existence is meant to be lived for a short while and then its time to fold back into time. As long as you dont fear it, the whole process doesn't hurt."
Salvia,fr52t96,t1_fr52aw5,1589901493.0,"Well I think im going to make an update post once I can articulate. I smoked about 30 minutes ago and just came back. I dont think i breakthrough but I felt ""them"" I saw them and I get it. We're part of that zipper, that folding, and its not something to fear. Some people dont get it. I know I sound crazy as hell but...time for an update ðŸ˜‚"
Salvia,fr3jiam,t1_fr3j7wt,1589858763.0,"Yes, 20x extract. It was....insanity. Chaos. Fear. But I didn't prepare myself (you can't really), did wayyy too much and not in the best setting. The intense affects lasted about 20 minutes and the aftereffects lasted legitimately 3 hours. Im finally at baseline."
Salvia,fr2zikw,t1_fr2vdrk,1589846930.0,"Completely correct. I did too much sat in my car. I thought it'd feel dysphoric and dissociative but salvia is a WHOLE notherr thing lol.

Salvia,fr2pit3,t1_fr2ov2j,1589841450.0,"The fear seems incredibly rational while you're being consumed by a collective consciousness that you never knew existed that seems to want to drag you to a place that you dont belong. Not gonna lie, now that im pretty much at baseline Im curious to enter that world again. But too terrified I might get stuck there. It's incredible to witness and feel something so dark and twisted and offputting but so real and all encompassing."
Salvia,fr2m8gw,t1_fr2lyss,1589839772.0,"You don't sound harsh at all. I thought I did enough research and could handle whatever happened but I was wrong. Totally my fault for doing it in my car and with music on. I thought the music would help since I love that song on ketamine, but that was different."

Maybe horny af. DO NOT MISS WITH METH. It will burn the second you slip out of a vein. Be careful. The needle is hell.
