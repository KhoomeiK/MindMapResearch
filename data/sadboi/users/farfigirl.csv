AmItheAsshole,fe60po4,t3_eno5q8,1578879181.0,"NTA. Long but pertinent anecdote: My mom had a lung transplant in 1995. Afterward, she had one of those weekly pill dispensers that had seven compartments. She used it for all the pills she had to take IN A DAY. Each hour, she had to take a different combo. It was easier for her to stay on track that way. 

She'd been sick since childhood, so after years of physical struggle, she left the hospital with no fucks left to give. So, we ate at a restaurant, she'd take out her pill dispenser and take  the ones she needed for that hour. She didn't make a big deal out of it unless she was asked. And, boy, if you did! She'd tell you about each pill, why it needed to be taken at that time, and any and all side effects they had. She also had no problem showing off her surgical scars if they came up in conversation no matter where we were. She was a tiny, 80-pound Japanese woman who reasoned it was okay to pull up her shirt in public because she was flat-chested. 

Long story short: if you ask about someone's medical shit in public, you should be prepared for the answer. If your friend's boyfriend was so easily offended, he shouldn't have asked you about your meds. That's on him. And good on you for taking them on a set schedule! üòâ"

news,fbdf9hc,t1_fbcbc2r,1576760287.0,I remember seeing two clips where they told him they were adopting him out to another family. And then they didn't take him to Disney World because he was too bad. Poor kid. I'm glad he lives with his mom now
TalesFromYourServer,fb6jhjj,t1_fb5dd9u,1576551823.0,"I agree. They really wanted to teach her and the paper a lesson, but it was a little much. I think the author had to write a retraction and apology, and that was about it. Made me think twice about crossing librarians, tho! üòâ"
TalesFromYourServer,fb4p5xo,t1_fb4nkqm,1576513052.0,IKR. My recollection is that they asked for her and the head editor to be expelled. A gang of angry librarians is not something you want to go up against
TalesFromYourServer,fb4gcxh,t3_ebcu1r,1576508430.0,"When I was in college back in the day, a reporter for the school's paper wrote an article about how she ripped out a page from a book in the school's library. She was shocked when the librarians came for her THE VERY NEXT DAY. So, yeah, it's one thing to do that kind of thing, but it's another level of trashy to actually confess to it because you think it's no big deal."

Disrespect isn't funny, esp when it comes from a partner. I hope your boyfriend learns that quickly and can turn this around"
Columbus,faoh4xy,t3_e9jd2n,1576264230.0,"I go through Primary One for therapy and psychiatric meds. It can take time to go through their phone system. For most appointments, you can call and be immediately booked, but they pass along patient phone numbers for Behavioral Health for them to get back to you. I PM'd you my therapist's phone and email address in the hopes you can talk to someone sooner. I know Primary One is on a sliding scale, so you can ask my therapist about cost.

Primary One also has a psychiatrist and psychiatric nurses who can prescribe medication. 

Unfortunately, I know it can be difficult finding mental health resources in Columbus, so I hope you're able to find something that suits your needs sooner rather than later. Good luck!"
