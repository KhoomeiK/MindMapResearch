My biggest complaint is still the map, if they're not gonna make the map more detailed they should at least give us the option to name our stamps.

Umm the only 'similar' game I can think of is Celeste, mostly because Im waiting to have time (ironically) to play it through. Hyper Light Drifter is also a really good choice if you enjoyed the combat aspects, much more challenging and stuffed with puzzles, often with enemies everywhere as well."

However, you can simulate it getting quieter by incrementing the z effect on the DPCM channel from Z00 to Z7F (iirc), or just make it Z7F immediately lol. However, doing that means your noise channel's volume also decreases. It has something to do with delta count or something but I never really bothered with all the technicalities lol. Just know that both triangle and noise channel's volumes are affected by DPCM channel in use.
