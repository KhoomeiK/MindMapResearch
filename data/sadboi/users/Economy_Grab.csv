If the virus had a surefire way of identifying it - a unique symptom like a rash - it would be easy to isolate people that are sick. A lot of people get really mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. 

If the virus was more deadly it would scare people into actually staying home.

If the virus had a lower incubation period then isolation and staying at home would be much more effective."
