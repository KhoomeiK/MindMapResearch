Maybe you will just have to have more of a stern talk and make it clear to people that you're completely happy with the way things are. Also, you can mention that they shouldn't really be judging other people's relationships. 
You and your boyfriend are the only two people that matter in this situation."

The best thing you could have done is to inform your parents. A lot of people are worried about people's reactions so don't feel as though they have any choice but to keep it to themselves.

CPTSD,fqykwk6,t3_gldy5t,1589750255.0,"First of all I'm sorry that your doctor was so dismissive. Secondly, I'd like to thank you for making this post :). I'm in the exact same boat and it's difficult to break down the mental barriers that prevent you from actually being becoming employed, but also renaming in the job too.  
I had several bad experiences in my previous jobs which lead to existing anxiety and depression to become far worse. 
I'm still dealing with working though all of that but it's left me with a fear of working again in another job. 
I think from an outsider perspective, people equate having a job with a sense of purpose, a social life and money. 
However, the reality is often different for a lot of people - myself included. People think that depression and anxiety will miraculously improve once employed. That's great if it does help people but for many others it isn't the answer. 
It's definitely a bit of a sore point for me as I think it's easy for people to judge those who aren't employed. It really isn't anyone else's business but some people can be quick to judge.
Any sort of work related trauma is difficult because the fear of starting a job and having to integrate in to a workplace is very overwhelming - particularly when dealing with anxiety and depression. 
Working on yourself is the most important thing and remembering that the only person's opinion that should matter is your own. I'm working on this myself too."

I am hyper aware of any form of criticism and turn it inwardly so I feel as though I'm to blame when the reality is that it's often nothing to do with me at all.  
I also have pretty low self-esteem too so it ties in.

Low self esteem lead to other issues for me too such as telling myself that my partner will leave me for someone else. I also struggle with spiralling thoughts too.

People will make time for people they want to make it for. I actually think that was an excuse in his case and it's completely understandable why you feel hurt. 
I think with some people, it can just be impossible to figure out what's really going through their mind and it's actually not even worth trying to figure it out.

It's likely that your girlfriend has negative core beliefs about herself. These can be difficult to change - but possible. 
Ideally, it would be good for her to either start researching things herself or to start therapy. She would benefit from looking in to things such as low self esteem, negative self -talk, challenging core beliefs.

It's completely up to you if you still want her in your life as I understand this is a difficult time for you. I will say that I don't think that you should trust her now however and that I think you should eventually come to terms with maybe being by yourself.

Anxiety is a response to situations I've been through but it's as though the bad situations have left an imprint and now it's easier for me to become anxious subconsciously due to fear that I will be in similar situations and feel the same way that I did at the time. 
It can be complex and I find myself getting caught up in wanting to get back to my 'old self'. I go through periods where I feel as though that version of my doesn't exist anymore.

I think it will be good for your brother to know that he has support and that other people are going through the same things.

I think thar it's important to just have time to yourself to have some respite. Meditation and relaxation apps are good for this so you can try to block people out. I usually just tell people that I'm going to have earphones in so that I'm not disturbed.
Going through a break up is bad enough, but it's even worse when you're then in another draining environment.

I use the Hada Labo Premium all of the time on damp skin - it works best for me this way as hyaluronic acid is a humectant so draws moisture so it's better to apply on damp skin.

I use the Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented. I tried the original version and it didn't agree with my skin - I love a lot of other Klairs products though :). The Supple Prepartion Unscented is a clear and light texture so I apply a few layers of this. 

I purchased the Kikumasamune lotion but didn't care much for it. It contains ferments so I don't think my skin responded well to it as it caused slight irritation. A lot of people love it though so it may work well for you.

I use The Ordinary Niacinamide most days but it's not for hydration. It's mostly to tackle uneven skin tone and to help fade PIE. 

I like the Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Serum but I prefer the cream instead as it provides a lot more hydration.

relationships,fplnt0m,t3_ge4l6p,1588716092.0,"As a fellow anxiety sufferer, I can genuinely say that I don't think there's anything more going on between them. To be honest, I'm pretty impressed by how they've both handled the situation - particularly by how she is keen to be friends with you. That would tell me that she understands how it could potentially look but that she's interested in getting to know you and be friends with you too. That is very reassuring. I also think that your boyfriend seems pretty forthright too.

Anxiety does have a way of clouding judgement and makes you question things and overthink. The needing reassurance will be due to anxiety so I think it would help you to read up on some things. Do you feel as though you have low self-esteem? There are quite a few things I've read that help me so may be beneficial to you too."

It's pretty normal to question whether it's signs of depression. I, too had a rough few years, and as a result just found it more draining being around people.
That's improved now but I just have less desire to be around other people and just prefer my own company.

I was informed by my therapist that it is very delicate and to stop when you feel it's too much and revisit when you feel ready. The brain is complex and traumatic memories are suppressed as a coping mechanism. When you begin to unravel these memories, it can be extremely overwhelming. 
I learned that traumatic events aren't processed in the same way as other memories so that's why there's a physiological response once you begin to think about them.

Sweating doesn't affect pores in my experience. I usually go to the gym (prior to lockdown), and sweat actually exacerbates any skin conditions so it's probably best that you avoid sweating too much at the moment - if you can help it. 
Some people find that niacinamide helps with pore size - but this is generally for those with oilier skin types who have more visible pores. 
Your pores will seem more noticeable at the moment, but as your skin heals, they will reduce in size again. Mine are more visible when my skin is dehydrated however they aren't visible once my skin is hydrated.

SkincareAddictionUK,fooc1uu,t1_foobne5,1587936331.0,"Also when your skin type is dehydrated (like mine too), it makes it easier for fine lines to seem more obvious as there's no moisture in the skin to plump these lines.

My skin type is just prone to dehydration all of the time so I have to make sure I use products that keep it hydrated. If skin is prone to dehydration anyway then it's very easy for it to go out of balance and for your moisture barrier to become compromised  - this has happened to me a number of times. 
I only figured out my skin type after using products that didn't work and then figuring out what makes my skin look best. 
You might want to look in to TEWL too (this is transepidermal water loss) which happens through the night and is common in those with dehydrated skin -myself included. 
I can let you know my routine and what works best for me since my skin is dehydrated too :). That is probably just your skin type - in the same way that some people have a more oilier skin type. 
I forgot to ask too whether when your skin feels tight, does it ever seem like your skin looks almost shiny but there's no moisture? I get this and it's definitely a sign of dehydration so that may be an indicator."

SkincareAddictionUK,fon97np,t1_fokxi52,1587914931.0,"I completely understand. To be honest, I actually avoid looking at myself in certain mirrors because it makes me self-conscious and that's when thoughts begin to spiral. I have under eye hollows - just genetically but they look a lot worse in certain lights. If I catch a glimpse of myself sometimes when they look bad, it makes me feel bad about myself. It's something I still struggle with but I'm able to recognise these patterns now which makes it easier to manage - if that makes sense?
I also attend CBT sessions for anxiety mostly - unrelated to appearance - but the thought process can be the same for a lot of things. Once something about yourself is triggered, then the spiralling can happen quickly so I've been trying to learn to challenge the negative thoughts about myself. This has also helped in relation to my skin/appearance too.
Yes. stress can also affect skin too. 
The Timeless CoQ10 is pretty much an antioxidant serum but it's very soothing on the skin. It's also mentioned to be an alternative to retinol as it contains peptides - which are good for anti-aging. 
It helps with fine lines and also hydrates too as it contains hyaluronic acid. 

Water, Matrixyl 3000™ , Ubiquinone, Aloe Barbadensis, Glycerin, Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin e, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid.

That's the ingredient list so there's no harsh active ingredients. I also find aloe vera gel to be great when my skin is compromised. I've used the Benton Aloe Propolis Gel and the Isntree Aloe Gel. Again, they are very soothing and when my skin couldn't tolerate much else, I used aloe vera gel a lot along with an oil on top which helped my skin to heal a lot."
SkincareAddictionUK,fokvyta,t1_fokqumr,1587849992.0,"Yes I often re-apply moisturiser :). It works best for my skin to reapply.
As for your first point, I've actually seen a number of posts from people saying that the skincare boards aren't really good for mental health. I've commented on a few posts myself stating that becoming interested in skin can be a bit of a double edged sword. It can make you keen to learn more however it can then lead to finding more faults and flaws with your skin. People can become caught up in the quest for 'perfect skin' - which often doesn't even really exist. 
I've also seen a number of posts from people who have reflected and realised that what they were trying to achieve isn't possible and that it's better for their mental health to step away from the skincare boards. 
It's much more common for it to affect people's mental wellbeing than a lot of people may realise. As I've also mentioned - I too was becoming too obsessed with trying to fix faults with my skin.
I have a healthier approach now - I'm still using products for my skin concerns but I've worked on not letting panic set in. 
Skin problems can be a big trigger for panic and anxiety and then the thoughts spiral. Have you experienced that? I have a problem with spiralling thoughts about a few things and it can be difficult to stop in it's tracks. 
As I mentioned, there's usually a correlation between skin issues and mental wellbeing so a lot of people are definitely affected. I think a lot of people gravitate towards the skin subs because it's affecting their mental health so it can be helpful to know that others often deal with similar issues :)"
SkincareAddictionUK,foksgjx,t1_fokill3,1587848078.0,"Honestly it's no problem :). It sounds as though you're hard on yourself but it's very easy to make errors with skincare - especially as there's so much information and advice out there. I made a lot of mistakes myself too and my skin was just over-exfoliated and very reactive so I felt as though the damage would be permanent but it wasn't. Starting a skincare routine can be trial and error and can be really frustrating if you feel as though your skin looks the worst it has but most people have been there themselves :). I've seen a lot of posts from people who feel the same so please don't feel as though it's your fault - it takes time to really find out about your skin and it can mean mistakes can be made in the meantime.
I actually looked in to OCD and body dysmorphia - but in relation to my face. I think it's a bit of a rabbit hole once the search for skin related issues start and it's very easy for it to take over your life. I genuinely understand how you feel. 
There are some ingredients that work well for plumping the skin. These have been great for me as my skin has a tendency to be dehydrated. 
Hyaluronic acid and peptides. Hyaluronic acid is an ingredient that adds hydration to the skin - and isn't harsh on the skin (it isn't an exfolaiting acid). Peptides help collagen production. 
A product I started to use when my skin was damaged was the Timeless CoQ10 serum. It helped my skin to heal. I've linked the product for you to take a look.
https://www.timeless-uk.com/products/timeless-skin-care-coenzyme-q10-serum-1-oz-30ml. 
I was scared to put anything on my skin as everything was burning and irritating it and my skin was constantly red. I found that applying oils helped too when everything else was burning. I used The Ordinary Marula or Rosehip Oil."
SkincareAddictionUK,fokf873,t1_fojgimy,1587840964.0,"Oh no you don't have to apologise - you're not rambling whatsoever :). Please don't worry. It will be temporary :). The skin goes through a cycle  every 28 days or so. This is why it usually takes around three weeks to a month to show signs of repair. 
I honestly understand how you feel. I damaged my barrier and due to anxiety I convinced myself that I had ruined my skin. Fine lines appeared and it was tight and irritated most of the time. But it was temporary. After a few weeks. my skin improved so please don't feel like it's permanent because it isn't :)
So one product that's really important is SPF. I wear it every day as it allowed my skin to heal properly.  
What have you been using on your skin the past couple of days? 
When beginning to use active ingredients, there can be minor side effects but this is usually due to not wearing SPF. A lot of active ingredients (such as AHAs, azelaic acid etc), can make skin more susceptible to UV damage - this is why it's really important to wear SPF. 

I completely understand how overwhelming it can feel and that feeling of dread and doom that comes along with thinking that your skin is ruined but for me it was definitely anxiety and obsessive thinking that was fuelling how I thought. 

I actually started using azelaic acid on top of moisturiser when I started to use it. Buffering is a great way to slowly introduce an ingredient as it minimises the risk of irritation. What percentage is your azelaic acid? I use the Paula's Choice Azelaic Acid Booster - which is 10%. 

I think right now, your skin would benefit from some hydration and just allowing it to repair itself. Tightness and the feeling of stinging/burning is a definite sign of a compromised barrier - I've experienced it myself several times. My skin is also prone to dehydration most of the time so I've learned what works for my skin over time. Please don't feel like you're alone in experiencing it :)"
