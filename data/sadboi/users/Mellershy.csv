Sometimes they'll give you back the prescription at which point you can take that piece of paper back to any pharmacy and just hand it over.

If you have nil repeats you'll have to go back to the doctor to organise more. Hope this helps."

Like everytime I washed my hands I'd dry them and put hand cream on straight away (and cuticle oil when I had the time). I found the scented locciatane creams absorbed pretty quickly, but the normal almond one and the intensive care one takes forever to absorb.They smell very nice too which is lovely, and you can often get a trio pack of the smaller size (which actually lasts a really long time) on sale every other month

The other thing you could do is get a product like Burt's bees almond and milk hand cream which is a heavier product and apply it at night and then put gloves on while you sleep so it all absorbs really well. This is a great way to get moisture back into your hands fairly quickly."

But I'm also aware that this is considered quite quick for a dsp claim, when I put the application in I was told to be prepared for a wait. I don't think filing complaints will actually do anything either, you just need to be patient. 

If you're having trouble with the cost of things I think (I might be wrong here) but I think you can apply to access the dsp pension card instead of the newstart one, it'll get you the same $6.50 prescriptions, but more places accept it for bulk billing."

I know it probably doesn't help but if you're not getting accepted it's most likely not a case of you not hitting the criteria (Sorry but I really try hard not to say things like ""I'm not sick enough"" because that just further imprints it in your head) and more likely that they are just too busy/full to take you.

One thing that my doctor and I do when something like this happens is she books me in to see her weekly so she can touch base and help me talk things through while keeping an eye on my physical health and if she notices it she can call the ambo to take me into the ER which always gets you into the ward within 24 hours.

It's not so bad now as I have a great support team in place (clinical psych, psychiatrist, and a mental health gp) who know so much about me and my cycles. I've definitely noticed that I have certain times of the year every year that are a high or a low, my psych says that's just part of figuring out how it effects you personally.

Yeah I still have hospitalisations, and yes I'm on my countries form of disability, and no I'm not an artist, but I still manage okay. I have my routines and I'm very good that when I feel the first twinges of a high or a low I get in touch with someone from my support team and we work through it as needed. My go says I'm a very good mental health patient haha!

I guess really my point is that the more active you are in seeking support the better off you'll be. A bit of mania is dealt with quickly by either a change of medication, or a PRN, or a trip to the clinic for safety. Same goes for a depression (except I add in a lot of time with my clinical psych when I'm depressed as I find that makes me accountable)"

Also (and this might sound bad) but the place I go to was an ED inpatient facility and in the last six or seven years it's been open to all mental health aspects but there's never a chance to get a nurse on their own for a chat when you need someone to talk you down because they are always preoccupied with the ED patients crying at all hours of the day.
I have two solutions for this, firstly obviously put more damn nurses on for the rest of us. 
Or, adjust how they assign rooms differently. We have three wings, surely we could do one for ED, one for those going through ECT, and one for the rest of us. It always seems weird to me that we're all just mixed in together seeing as those groups have three distinct separate needs (especially when they have to go through all wings looking for the patients trying to skip meals or body confidence)"
