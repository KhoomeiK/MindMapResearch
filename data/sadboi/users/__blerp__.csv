Yeah, I thought I would. At first I tried to cut off contact which failed because she got mad, now I am in close contact and it is just as bad, and quarantine is not helping either.

I feel for you man - I also have already had a heart ultrasound, EKG, 24 hour heart rate monitor, etc.

The obsession changes all the time which I am only realizing now.. it used to be dry eyes, leg edema, blurry night vision, dark circles, extreme tiredness, arm sweating, etc. all which have ebbed and flowed/resolved on their own and never actually represented disease.

I'm just tired of trying to ""solve"" my health problems at this point I am trying to just go with the doctors and let things balance out over time, trying to ignore what I ""perceive"" as health problems along the way if my doctor says there is nothing to worry about."
OLED,fnwtb39,t1_fnwszpj,1587325028.0,"> ving companies have boxes and padding specifically designed to transport TVs. You should ask your moving company how they handle TVs.

That's the problem, I don't know which moving company I will go with.

I agree, it doesn't seem the box was meant for re-use, but at least the styrofoam even without the box seems like it would be really useful for just surrounding the Tv. Doesn't seem like the box itself is of much use at all."
OCD,fnwmrwn,t1_fnwld4g,1587321371.0,"That is actually very comforting, and so true. It is an obsession thing, and if it wasn't heart disease for me it would be something else. The content of the obsession isn't really relevant. It just whatever our brain decides to ""stick"" onto."
OCD,fnwmljk,t1_fnwlbp1,1587321273.0,"Thanks for sharing your story - it is comforting to know there are other people going through similar issues. :)

> Needless to say, not sure if you find this yourself, but my brain is so “powerful” that it manifests symptoms and pain, further exacerbating the obsession. Now, I say powerful because that actually is what has helped me prep for not just labor, but also has helped me frame this disorder in a way that brings me peace. If my brain can be so powerful as to manifest pain/symptoms, then it can do the opposite, right? That has been a huge step in the right direction for my recovery.

That's an excellent way of putting it. I actually have a very similar issue.. been having really bad heart pounding/palpitations/chest tightness which my doctor thinks is due to stress/anxiety and I obsess over it because of my obsession with heart disease, and like you said it just makes everything worse and it is a vicious cycle."
OCD,fnwk5gf,t1_fnwjj81,1587319926.0,"This is great, thank you so much. I definitely haven't taken that route yet.

I am starting to realize that stating there is nothing to worry about is also a compulsion. Better to accept the uncertainty and accept I've done everything I rationally can and move on from the thought.

Very easy to miss that as a compulsion."

personalfinance,fn77qxo,t1_fn76tae,1586714934.0,AFAIK it will just decrease what I can contribute to my traditional since the max contribution for all 401k combined (traditional + roth) is the same as for each individual account if you had not made any contributions to the other one.

I agree it is very challenging to separate heart palpitations from disease but the reality is there isn't much of a link as far as I understand if there are not other symptoms present - for example I do tons of high intensity exercise with no chest pain, etc."
