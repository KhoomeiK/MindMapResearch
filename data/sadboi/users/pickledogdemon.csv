AskVet,fqa3p5e,t1_fq9pzxv,1589212262.0,I did think this would be the answer! Thank you
AskVet,fq6zqcz,t3_gh6z6w,1589139922.0,I would definitely try the vet again. Can you send them the pictures via email? That's definitely abnormal
blogs,fmz9sbj,t3_fy3clr,1586512075.0,I started a few months ago talking about books and mental health with a few mentions of my crazy dog along the way. [https://mentalstormbooks.com/](https://mentalstormbooks.com/) would love to find similar blogs to follow too!!
fuckeatingdisorders,fml2q37,t3_fvpejm,1586177039.0,"Opening up is the first step. Can you explain to both your parents how hard this is for you? Ask them to be patient and gently encouraging until you can figure this out?  
My mum yelled at me A LOT, but she was just scared and didn't know what else to do watching me hurt myself.

You ARE strong enough, you CAN do this.  


there are tons of resources online. Try  [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/)  as a starting point for both you and her and go from there. If you arent ready for professional help that is okay, there are books and guides online that can help you get back to healthier eating habits. Deleting MyFitnessPal should be your first step though, it is unhelpful at best and triggering at worst.

This is all scary and will be an emotional time for everyone, be brave, keep trying and things do get better"

It is so hard to be on the outside watching someone you love suffer. Don't be afraid to reach out for support yourself and don't take any harsh or negative comments personally, especially ones relating to weight, thinness or food intake. Eating Disorders screw perspective amongst everything else.  
Be there for her if she wants to talk, listen and don't judge or make suggestions beyond those she is told in therapy. And most importantly, the desire to recover has to come from her, no matter how much you want to make it better yoursef.

I hope this helps a bit, I have been both a sufferer and support to family members and friends"
fuckeatingdisorders,fml1cdt,t3_fvevxp,1586175920.0,"Heck yes! You can do this! Get angry, yell at the stupid voice that tells you mean things about yourself when you are truly AMAZING. We are all here supporting you and we are all so proud that you have taken the hardest step and decided enough is enough.

Go be free of this"
fuckeatingdisorders,fmhs18z,t3_fvarnr,1586091793.0,"I have been ""recovered"" for 3 years and still struggle a little with an up and down relationship with food, and especially when I am stressed or worried it can all start to build up again. The key for me is to keep using the tools and suggestions given in therapy and to not be afraid to reach out for help again.  


When things have been really bad I have gone back to fully mapped out meal plans, set meal times and a CBT diary that I was given at the start of recovery. I know the plans are healthy, balanced and contain enough calories to keep me at a steady weight and I have learnt to trust them as a tool for when I cannot trust myself to come up with healthy plans.  


Recovery is not a linear process and I am sure all of us has been through stages of regressing and recovering. Keep moving towards your goal of rediscovering the relationship with food that you had as a child and you will get there.   


I found it helpful to also note the daily behaviours I used at my worst and my daily (or weekly) behaviours now, charts of times binged a day/week/month can help too, as you can really see progress and it takes the emotional guesswork out of recovery.

I hope this helps a little"
mentalhealth,fmhr23f,t3_fv5y5j,1586090932.0,"Yup. Was also the super smart over achiever who couldn't handle the self inflicted pressures of university and am following one dead end job after another because I cannot handle my own expectations when working in a more mentally demanding job.   
Now I get called ""an old soul"" because at 24 I am tired of the world"
