Effectively it means the roof is wood and the ceiling is the roof. Looks great, super cool southwestern vibe, people like them, not so good for insulation though. What this means is, the roof expands and contracts A LOT due to temperature change. At times it can sound like someone just jumped for roof. And depending on what part of the roof, say above the living room, if you were in the bedroom it would sound like it was coming from down the hall. It's always worst at times of temp change like just after sunset and before sunrise but can happen anytime depending on environmental conditions. It's bad enough that my ex girlfriend really thought someone was breaking in or waking on the roof when she was first staying over. 

So perhaps that is something to consider. (My house is brick with beam ceilings, to give you an idea.) 

But to be sure, Amazon prime or go to best buy and get a ""blink"" camera system. Works super well and can be set up in minutes. 

Or, if you want to get old school, a company called 5th ops makes a tripwire device for a shotgun round that you can put capsaicin rounds in. So whoever trips it gets a loud bang and a face full of pepper spray

They would be breathing heavily and their heart would be racing. And that's being awoken by someone they knew was sleeping next to them like every other night. They would still be utterly confused. 

   So now, imagine you are just rocked awake by the sound of a door being kicked in and people screaming. I bet you wouldn't hear a word they were yelling because you would get a massive adrenaline dump and your brain would be completely dialed in to one thought and one objective; ""people are here to kill me : survie.""
