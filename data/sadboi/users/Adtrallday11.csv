CrohnsDisease,fqxna4l,t1_fqxkmuq,1589734934.0,I'm hopefully going to get in and see a doctor really soon. Just working around the covid has been really hard. But I'm wanting to get on a better path. I'm sick too much and it makes me hate life
CrohnsDisease,fqxn5l9,t1_fqxkwv9,1589734879.0,"I actually  got my primary physician  set, and I'm living in Pennsylvania  and my sister has crohns, so I'm going to go see her doctor as soon as I am able to get an appointment. Hopefully I can call up this week and try to make one. 

As far as the depression,  that is one thing I've felt with for my whole life, so I've got that under control. I smoke weed to help with my mental issues, and it does help with my stomach pains at times. But I do really need to get on some meds for my crohns. Its causing problems with my working life and my life in general. 

And with the support system, I have a pretty good one. For some  people it's taken time to understand  what I go through. And for some, they still don't get it. Like my boss. We fight all the time because of butting heads because  of my being sick. I'm in the electrical field and it makes it hard to be able to deal with me being sick. But in working on trying to find a new job. And a new career."

But also I don't feel like when I drink,most of the time, I don't even feel anything from it. It's weird. I figured it could be my stomach not digesting it right? Who knows. But I just smoke weed, it helps with my stomach and other pains I have. I get nerve pain and aches in my knees. Knees have been since I was little. And I also get random bad short migraines.

And I don't have insurance and can't go back to a doctor since my parents took me off their insurance. So I'm stuck smoking weed to help with my pain and nasuea and no Doctor."
CrohnsDisease,fdexkh1,t1_fdet60t,1578348724.0,"See me and my wife have cut out most meat. We only eat chicken and ground turkey and then sea food when we can afford it.

I also try to stay away from dairy (it's really hard to because I love it all) but I never have hungry other than in the morning and at night. Never during the day. Now that may be because I can't smoke (marijuana) at work so when I do get to medicate I'm pain free (for the most part unless it's really bad) and my hunger is better. Oh and the nasuea is crazy. Some days I can't eat lunch at all or else I'm literally almost throwing up. Also I don't know if this may be in your case too, but I'm 22 and my entire childhood, that I can remember, I always remember feeling sick to my stomach, almost every day, like very bad nasuea.

LSD,fckq3di,t1_fcknhux,1577730750.0,"That makes sense, I just get frustrated when I need to talk and don't get responses.

And I kinda had a feeling that it wasn't as strong as what I've had in the past, but it definitely was strong enough for me to get what I needed. Ive been struggling a lot with depression and life lately, just in a very low spot in my life and am more broke $ wise than I have been In a long time and just stressed, but after the trip I feel a hell of a lot better.

And I do feel that if you try too hard to ""have the trip you want"" you don't get that at all. That's how shrooms were for me. My first trip I freaked out and started shaving panic attacks ( I had smoked 2 fat ass blunts so I think thats why, but I've smoked weed with L a lot so didn't think much about it) but when I tripped my 3rd or so time on shrooms I broke down and has a similar experience. But I don't think I delt with the experience the way I needed to and that's why my acid trip went the way it did. Also I haven't been very emotional the past 3 or so years of my life, and I feel a lot more now. More than depression that is. 

And I just want to know how to let go and let the acid take over and show me everything it needs to. I get too anxious and I don't let myself experience what I need to. I kinda shut myself off from the trip? I've been to counseling for years and years and years and been on psych meds before and nothing has helped, psychadelics seem to be helping me a lot, but I need more from it. Maybe I just need to trip harder and try to meditate?"

LSD,fck6438,t1_fck4qze,1577717655.0,"This makes a lot of sense. Last time when I first started trying L I did I almost every weekend for a few months, and it was more of a ""fun time"" type of trip, and the last time I tripped I saw ""my friend"" in a different light, he seemed demonic in a way, and I started to reevaluate my life and how he was just using me all the time. So I feel like me not using L as a way to discover my self more and I used it as a fun time type of thing, that I got hit like a brick wall and had a ""bad"" trip, I don't believe in a bad trip, just that a ""bad"" trip is what you need to realize what you need to fix about yourself. I just thought it was weird this time that I didn't have many visuals or anything. I've done 1 tab before and had visuals. Ive had a theory that acid does whatever you need it to do, for me I think that was having an emotional break down, and thats why I didn't have many visuals and was feeling and thinking more than seeing."
