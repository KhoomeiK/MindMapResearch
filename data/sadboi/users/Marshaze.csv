ems,fom5xpo,t1_foknwy7,1587879259.0,"There are a lot of factors that go into why the number of deaths in our region is so large. In southern and south east Ohio, where I worked as a FF/Paramedic for a good stint, there are not many medics. It was not uncommon to be one of two or three in the county. I've had nights where we were all at the same mva when the next one comes in and we have to decide who is breaking off and taking that, because the next county over can't backfill us because they have 15 members on their department and only two are EMT's and they had a drink at dinner because they're off. And when the heroin started destroying our communities, there were times where we had to transport patients in the bed of our utility pick up and on backboards on the floor of our utility/air truck. It gets crazy when a ""bad batch"" comes into town. People start falling out all over the place. I even had a Sherriff's Deputy overdose on heroin on the way into work. Thankfully, a state highway patrolman saw him driving erratically and got him to pull over and turn the car off before he nodded out at which point the patrolman got on the radio asking for more resources and running to his cruiser for the Narcan. It worked (the patrolman still gave all the Narcan he had, which is four doses. He even told me he gave him another one after he was talking rationally and oriented to his whereabouts, circumstances, etc. because he ""was afraid he might stop breathing again!"" That's the issue in my original reply to the comment above me. That officers are giving it way yo often and too many doses, sometimes when they wake up, even. It feels like every patient who isn't walking around is getting four doses of Narcan, making them wet from it by the time we get there."
ems,foldi2h,t1_foklwen,1587859911.0,"I won't deny that officers are certainly saving some lives, sometimes even with Narcan. Our brothers and sisters in blue never get the credit they deserve. I could rant for hours about that topic.

The issue is that there are some definite contraindications like hypersensitivity. The problem is that most people have never had the happenstance to have been given Narcan prior to an officer giving it, often in the incorrect manner(again that's just anecdotal information. That's different from department to department.) Then what does the officer do as the situation turns and the pt goes into anaphylaxis? This can and does happen.

And I genuinely do not give a single fuck about how much it costs to treat patients, and I'll spare you my rant about that. But, there IS a cost associated with the officers giving Narcan. Most agencies around me got a certain amount of Narcan through grants or some other program, I don't know the details, that's just what I've been told. But then that Narcan ran out and the community had an expectation at that point. Most of the departs I work with don't have the budget for buying Narcan."
ems,foki5w5,t1_fokexl0,1587842511.0,"See, you don't have to even work in the field and understand that's, to put it bluntly, stupid.

And to take the jargon out and put it more clearly, yes. In my state, Ohio, we have been hit really hard with heroin. I've seen infographics that say Ohio, Kentucky, and especially West Virginia have had the highest mortality rates related to heroin. As a response, some politicians got elected running on campaign promises to take strong measures to combat the heroin epidemic. In turn, they decided to give Narcan to law enforcement agencies and allow them to administer the drug.

Now, I can't speak for every agency and their policies. Anecdotally, I can say that the officers are not trained very well, some don't even have a formal training for it, for training new hires or even their current staff. And they are generally told they should use it on anyone they suspect could have used heroin. So basically, anytime they feel like the issue could be heroin related, they give it. And they give a lot before the squad generally pulls up. In EMS, we have algorithms and written out medical direction as policies, or what we call written orders. We are expected to have our written orders memorized and have printed copies as reference. Medicine is not simple and most officers I know don't want to have narcan because they don't feel qualified to do it and they don't want the added responsibilities associated with it. They have enough liability as it is. So, like most of medicine, politicians got involved where they have no business and cocked this up, too."
ems,fojrral,t1_fojgcjz,1587828008.0,"There it is. I just got into it with one of my cousins (Sherriff's Deputy) the other day over the Narcan issue. I swear, these guys are showing up on scene and doing 4 rounds of Narcan before we get on scene.

1. Most of them are not trained well enough to know when it's indicated, and most of them don't even have an inclination what the word contraindication means.

2. They treat every AMS like it's clearly heroin. Now, I've woken up 80y/o WF's from the Knight's of Columbus restroom, but more than likely, senior citizens aren't having a problem involving opiates.

3. They would be much better served by having a BVM and having them actually pay for PPE for medical calls, like masks with eye shields, gloves, the basics. That BVM could save a lot of lives at a much lower cost than that Narcan will. And shoot, that BVM even works on opiate overdoses!

Also, I see you're from the UK and having the same problems we are, at least on this issue. I'm always interested to learn about medics from different places. What cool things are in there scope of practice that I've never gotten to do? What kind of rig are they running? Some of them are really cool. What unique challenges do they have that I've not had, and what's done to mitigate those challenges? Maybe you have an answer to a problem some of the departments I work with haven't found yet. IDK, I just find it cool.

TL:DR Law Enforcement needs to stop Narcaning everyone 12 times before we get on scene."

HumansAreMetal,fehk6mq,t1_fehfwjc,1579118212.0,"Well, I agree on all your points. I was assuming (I know, we shouldn't do that) that there was a fire inside that building that had caused the tank to reach the point of using the relief valve to begin with, since the flames from that relief valve, as you pointed out, wouldn't be enough to cause a BLEVE in a propane tank. I was also assuming the tank wasn't full, therefore being comprised of at least a decent amount of vapor inside the tank, and with the relief valve going, that would be increasing. I also do know how to fight BLEVE's and have done so on a few occasions. They were all large anhydrous ammonia tanks for agricultural use, so not quite the same. You assume I'm an inexperienced and poorly or untrained fireman based on one opinion I gave, which I find to be a bit  pretentious. I'm always wanting to learn more, because knowledge can save you where experience lacks and every fire I fought was different. But, as an educator myself, I find leading with ""...because there's always somebody with little experience, like yourself, ..."" isn't very effective at engaging the people you're trying to educate.

And as to you're point about the gas building and creating a fuel air bomb, that's possible, but in this situation, that body of water looks to be moving. My knowledge of fluid dynamics tells me that the very movement of that water negates this risk. The volume of gas being expelled via that relief valve into a heavier liquid would not be enough to create anything close to a fuel air bomb, and the trapped gas moving away from the vessel and being released at different points throughout the travel of the water mean that, at most, you might get some quick flashes of light even if there were an ignition source."
HumansAreMetal,fehe9ds,t1_fegnrhl,1579114747.0,"No, he didn't . A BLEVE, where a flammable gas is compressed into a liquid in a pressurized vessel is exposed to an external heat source where the inside liquid reaches the boiling point at the pressure it's stored at and increases the pressure above the limitations if the vessel, causing a violent failure of the vessel and exposing the vaporized flammable gas to the heat source then explodes. This conflagration then causes the remaining flammable material that was inside the tank to reach its flammability level and a secondary, usually larger explosion occurs.

This is primarily stopped by firefighters by attempting to cool the vessel and extinguish or remove the external heat source. In this case, that heat source is not going to be extinguished by normal means, typically a smaller handling, because the nature of a propane tank, its contents and safety features. So this was probably the safest way for then to deal with it in the moment. And trust me when I say that moments can be all you have in this very dangerous situation. 

As for a large amount of gas building, waiting for an ignition source, I dont buh into that. Without a larger vessel to capture that gas escaping from the tank, theres a poor chance that at any one place the gas will be concentrated enough to be within its flammability limit.

That's my two cents as a fireman, I welcome further discourse."

AskReddit,f8xabde,t1_f8w4wja,1574912697.0,I used to work as a SWAT/SRT Medic for a while as a county resource. All we ever worked were warrants and meth labs. I drank tea in the OPS truck all day and made bank doing it. It wasnt untill I moved and didnt do any of that when I actually got called to assist the local guys here. *somehow* my patient was shot in the head. Didn't work out. A shitty way to go over a night of drinking gone wrong.
AskReddit,f8x791b,t1_f8vz172,1574910171.0,"Nah. People always ask about the full story after I give a quick quip. But after i explain in detail, they wish they'd only had a sip.

I'll give you a similar story, not one of guts or glory. I've been a firefighter/paramedic, and I can attest, the job can be hectic.

I once had to do a transport to a bigger hospital in a bigger city so they could see a specialist, the drive was two hours, my partner was only a basic, so she couldn't take the run (so I could drive, which would have been ideal because she had just done like 18hrs of driving, basically with the only break being the time to make the cot and catch a drink while I gave patient report at the ER. Seems okay, though. We definitely should be made responsible for people's lives while working sometimes two days without sleep or rest). So, the story is that it's some kind of throat issue, not sure what's going on in there, just know it isn't staying at our regional hospital. I load the woman on our cot after joking with her slutty nurse about how it *must be* an STD. Didnt get her number this time, but there's always tomorrow, as long as I keep taking a minute to stop doing any kind of treatment for my patients a few minutes before we show up at the ER so I always look fresh.

I get the throat thing on the cot, all wired up for lights and sound with the cardiac monitor and get some oxygen going for this simple mask the physician put on ""just in case"". I try my best to do my normal safety spiel and ask if she has any questions about what is happening, where shes going, why, what and when she can take her hands off the cot, etc. But she could only mumble through the mask.

We get moving and she asks me twenty times to adjust the head of the cot in as many minutes. I'm mildly annoyed at this. I'm trying to catch up on reports while keeping an eye on the cardiac monitor. It's going well.

Then she falls asleep for the rest of the trip. It's okay because I caught up on reports, took a breath after running three opiate overdoses that night. (There was a really concerning report I saw yesterday here about 'workers between 25 and 65 are dying way faster than the expected mortality rate and the 1% should be concerned because their industries wont have a work force. Ohio, my home state, led the charts. Along with Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.)

We roll into the big hospital up the road a ways, and she is still asleep. I put a warm blanket on her (you can easily set up a blanket warmer by placing all your plugged in shit on a shelf and covering it with blankets while they charge. You're piece of shit rig will likely catch on fire somewhere else before this ever becomes an issue. Or you'll die from the exhaust leaking into the cabin...

Anyways, we're standing at the charge nurses station and this patient sits bolt upright on the cot, rips the mask off, and then proceeds to cough out this thick pink mist that hangs in the air. And she keeps coughing and blots of rapidly drying mucous start collecting on her lips. I stood motionless, safe from this due to being more beside her than in front. She coughs for what feels like minutes, blowing this infectious shit all over the place in droplet form, it's like the worst possible scenario. The ER all but shuts down and I giggled as I strolled out of there with a ham sandwich and a bottled water from the EMS room, because that's what heroes do.

All joking aside, please never ask someone who works in public safety (law enforcement, ems, firemen, dispatchers, etc.) what the worst thing they've ever seen is. Or any variation of that question. We dont want to think about it anymore than we have to, and, trust me, we already cant stop thinking about those dead babies, broken and battered people, or, for some, the scenes of utter horror. I once responded to a car accident on the turnpike where a semi did not see stopped traffic ahead of them in a crowded construction zone. His truck was like a battering ram, throwing cars over the median barriers into oncoming traffic. And some cars were so smashed we couldnt tell where the bodies were even at in the car to see if they were alive. We were finding body parts hundreds of feet away, strewn between the shattered glass, twisted and thrown metal, and crushed and splintered plastics. But the worst that stuck with me was the maybe 5-6 year old boy who was thrown from his familie's minivan (his mother and siblings were all crushed to death in the van, only his father was alive, and completely injury free). He appeared to have landed on the concrete barriers set in between the lanes on his back, then slid. His body was what I found first, broken and smashed in a ball. Not curled up into a ball like you would think. No. He was curled around the other way, like a back bend, but his ass was touching the top of his head, what was left. He was dead when I found him, so I didnt try to move him. But after I black tagged him, I turned around and his spine was hanging from the concrete barrier. He slid for about 50 feet, but his spine didnt make it that far. It appeared to have ripped out after his skin, fat, muscle, etc had been ground off and part of the vertebrae caught between the sections of barrier, ripped what seemed to me to be most of his spine clean out, and his body was thrown up again and, judging by the blood, seemed to skid a bit further and fell off to the side. He was smiling, a front tooth missing. Then I had to tell his father. The man's entire family had been savagely and brutally taken from him in an instant. I still remember what that pain looks like in a man's eye. The way it sinks in, insidiously burning through happiness, then joy, then even hope leaves. And then I had to walk away from him to continue helping the rest of the broken and shattered families that day."

AskReddit,f8r01mf,t1_f8ql27k,1574728536.0,"I spent 17 years with my wife. I have four children with her that I'm left even questioning if they're of my loins or any random persons. I'm a larger man, 6 ft over 300lbs at times, a fireman and Paramedic with a troubled history as it came to success and failures. I'm not effeminate in any way, but I do generally believe in being kind and respecting others. I became an officer(supervisor) and led my men and women with dignity and respect, never asking for more than what I would do. And when I say 'would do', I do not mean the way someone says from behind a desk at the cubicle farm. I led them into fires, firefights as a swat medic, and any number of situations involving violence and chaos. I was awarded a ""Star of Life Award"", something the state gives out for acts of heroism and exemplary service keeping with the highest ideals of EMS and Firefighting. I was overly successful in my career.

At the same time, I worked 100+ hour weeks, every week, for over a decade. Sometimes pushing 140 hours. My wife verbally, physically, and emotionally abused me through out that entire time. She pushed me to work more and more while she sat at home, without a job, supposedly helping by watching our children. I would come home after literal days on the clock and she would make me cook, clean, mind the children, make the social calls with HER family while she isolated me from mine. She would spend that time going out and spending that money, but only on herself. My children wore thrift store clothes and handme-down's. I had two outfits outside of my work attire. She would make me feel guilty about every purchase we made for the family, but act offended if I asked if she really needed *another* $100 bra, or 5.

Then I got sick. I was diagnosed at 19 with diabetes and, despite spending years and hundreds of thousands of insurance's money, I never found a successful treatment. Two years ago, I was told by the world's best Endocrinology team that my life expectancy was only about two more years. I didnt tell anyone for the first year, I didnt really know what to do or say. I'm 33 this year, and if I live past November, I'll have exceeded that expectation. But last year, after taking my first vacation in 5 years, I was in a really low place. I'd gone for a nature walk with my children and the pain in my legs (peripheral neuropathy from the diabetes) had me doubled over, crying in pain. I believe in ending my life while I still have some dignity left, and in some states that IS legal. But not in my state. My wife ""helped"" me to come to the conclusion I should end my life. She helped me open the pill bottles and made me some Cherry juice, my favorite, then literally helped give me the three bottles of muscle relaxer I faithfully chewed and swallowed. She had only known about my prognosis for a week.

I was humiliated to wake up the next morning after telling my immediate family good bye, my mother and sister pleading with my wife to call the same squad I worked for and take me to the hospital I worked with. They literally fought over my limp, overdosing body in my home. I was still in my own bed in the morning. But I was blind, and fell down the stairs. I had to have someone else drive me to the emergency department.

I was placed into the local psych unit, where I knew most of the nursing staff and some of the patients. One of which I helped place in that same unit. I was released about a week later, during which, she further isolated me and wouldn't come see me, or bring my children to see me. It was hell.

I was released after she promised the psychiatrist she was going to be with me and love me through this. A week later, she asked me for a divorce, stating she 'didnt sign up to be with a cripple' and 'didnt want to take care of someone"". She was on her self love journey. I had to quit working shortly there after, partially because I now had the stigma of a crazy person professionally, and partly because my health continued to steadily decline to where I couldnt perform the vigorous OR detailed parts of my job anymore. I had refused a divorce and asked her to go to therapy with me. I was seeing a counselor for my PTSD from work and to work through my feelings going into death. She refused and said only pussies go to therapy. She had always been mean and critical, even physically violent whenever she drank. But she started to escalate things soon after I refused the divorce. She would hit me when I told her I couldnt get out of bed without my medicine and asked her to get it. She took over our finances completely, taking out my retirement savings and spending it. She started escalating fights, involving our children. One night just after labor day, she turned on my second oldest, a bubbly, well mannered 7 year old daughter who's fast becoming the social butterfly in her class. I never lost my temper with my wife before that day. But I snapped and began moving towards her to shake her out of this fit of rage she was in. Instead she turned on me and began hitting me in the face. I walk with a cane and fall frequently currently, and when she began hitting me, I fell, losing my balance. I was on top of her with her still hitting me. I was horrified to find my hands had landed on her neck. I was furiously trying to get up, but she was kicking, biting, and punching me. Once i got away, I called her father immediately to come get her. Instead, that piece of trash turned it on me saying I hit her and caused this fight. I had to leave my children with her while she smiled at me, standing behind them as they pleaded for me not to leave them. She let a laugh out when I started crying. And her dad called me a pussy, saying ""He must have been a terrible fireman if he cant even put you out!""

She then transferred every cent out of our joint accounts, filed a change in status with the dept of job and family services, and refused to let me see my children. She claimed I was an abusive partner and that I couldnt be trusted with my own children, wanted some form of ""supervised custody"" with someone she chose because I'm ""mentally unstable"" and ""prone to violence"". I have been gone for a few months and only seen my children a few times. I still have to live with her being a generally horrible person. I sit in counseling staring at a ""wheel of abuse"" they give out to battered women (it's clearly meant for women, it specifically outlines the 'husband's' acts that are abusive and how those acts are abusive.). I cry every day, usually to sleep, but I do so during the day at times I cant explain, too.

Why did I start dating her, and more so, why did I stay with her? We started in high school, and she ""confided in me"" that she was raped by one of my classmates (supposedly while we were dating). I wanted to protect her and make her feel safe again, love her through it, etc. Turns out, 16 years later, she tells me she lied about the whole thing so she could hang out with the rest of my friends. Then she got pregnant in school and her father forced her to have an abortion. Which I steadfastly supported her through, even though i didnt agree with what was happening. I couldnt leave her like that, despite my suspicions it wasn't even my child. Now I knew I couldnt leave her at the bottom like that.

I supported her ever since then, trying to love her through her problems, supported her financially, socially, emotionally, sexually... I don't know what else i could have done. In the end, I was thrown to the gutter like trash. Less than a week later, she had a new guy in my bed, didnt even change the sheets.

Females can and do abuse their partners just as frequently as male partners do. There are links in this thread to huge studies proving this beyond the shadow of a doubt. I hope if my story helps one other man feel like they aren't alone, or that they CAN leave, then it was worth the time to type this."
