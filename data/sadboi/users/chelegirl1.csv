I had to refund. So where are they? Please do tell. I hope they did not leave  a bad review because I never found them."

InstacartShoppers,fqmlx0e,t3_gjr871,1589479623.0,"Sometimes you cannot afford the alternative. So a couple years ago when I was a freshman in college, one summer I was so broke, I used Grubhub promo codes with various emails and credit cards to feed myself for under $7. It was cheaper to do that then to order food from the restaurant. That was all that was left in my account. So I understand your frustration, but having been less than broke and as a current, thriving shopper, it is important to be humble and empathetic, and mindful that you cannot know everyone's situation."

I am sorry if I encroach on other's profits but I have to put myself through college for right now. That is the only reason I am willing to put my health/life at risk, but I cannot imagine someone any older doing this right now. It is not worth it."

InstacartShoppers,fq8l6r6,t3_ghe9hw,1589168797.0,"Am I the only one irritated by these ""anti-noob"" posts that are denigrating and self-aggrandizing? First of all, each person making these posts started from a level of absolute ignorance as to where every item was. Personally, I have social anxiety and never interact with staff in stores, but asking for help a few times if new to a store is understandable. Second, just because someone is new to delivering groceries does not make that person unable to provide as good service as someone like OP. It isn't a special talent to pick items quickly with good quality, and drive them to someone's house, or replace smoked salmon with smoked mackerel. Third, yes, we get it, everything is oversaturated with shoppers, but do your job and provide high quality, and the rest will even out after the pandemic's severe impact has petered out. Many of us are doing this temporarily to pay for college or what have you, but we are not inept. That's all. Wonder if I am alone in these sentiments."

InstacartShoppers,fq0u0ja,t1_fq0srzp,1589037624.0,"Haha, that is actually exactly how I feel about my local Safeway and Wegmans. All the items match in the app for those 2 stores, unlike Harris Teeter for some reason, which rarely recognizes items."
InstacartShoppers,fq0ttd1,t1_fq0rvzr,1589037553.0,"Lol ok, nice not so subtle dis. When you could make $80 every couple of hours, it does not seem so worth it. You can only drive so fast for high mileage orders, but thanks again."

You should hold your ground because someone who causes you anxiety and does not understand the meaning of ""no"" and ""I do not want this"" has no place in your life. You will certainly find someone who loves you in a healthy and uplifting way, but give yourself time to heal and be alone. Revel in yourself!"
Anxiety,fngai6g,t3_fo6h6w,1586926502.0,"College junior here! I just found this thread and I am so grateful because I need to vent. Even though I was diagnosed with GAD about a year ago, I have not done anything about it after a few initial therapy sessions because I felt like it couldn't ever affect my life much if left untreated. And then today for the 5th time this week, my mother sent me a story about a young, fit, vegan who almost died from the virus. A few hours later, on my way home from my last home grocery delivery, I started having an icy cold feeling spread through my chest and it burned and hurt, my breathing was staggered, and I convinced myself I contracted the virus and would likely die. I started looking for the nearest hospitals, making plans for how I would tell everyone goodbye, etc. While this is not a sustainable way to live, there isn't much on the medical end I can do for help, so for now I need to block her for a while. It is comforting yet saddening to see I am not alone in the emotional impact this virus is taking."
