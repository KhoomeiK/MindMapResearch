WeddingPhotography,fiyw7bq,t3_fal7ne,1582848356.0,"I've been in a very similar situation before. I did my favorite cousin's wedding in December - I didn't have any issues during the day but the reception was difficult. My parents and my sister and all of my family basically were there - my cousin made it clear to me she wanted me to enjoy the reception but every time I sat down to take a breather something would happen and I'd be back up again.

It's not a BAD experience by any means - she paid me well for it despite offering a discount, and honestly I was very pleased with the photos, as were they. That being said, don't go into it thinking you can do both - it's either a guest or photographer, you know? Not that I didn't hug people in spare moments or say hi - but there wasn't really time to dance with everyone or talk. I didn't regret not getting to sit back and enjoy it because I was so happy to help my family member and she's SO, so laid-back so I knew it wasn't a worry.

Best of luck!!!"
BodyAcceptance,fiyg27y,t3_f5nexc,1582838717.0,"I had a really similar situation happen to me last summer. Over the course of a few months me and a pretty big group of friends decided to plan a trip for our high school graduation. From the moment we started planning it, I had so much anxiety about being around all these people in bathing suits all the time. The house we were staying at had a pool, we were right around the corner from the beach; it was like, why wear anything but a swimsuit?

Around my close friends, I would have probably been fine, but this was a larger group that I wasn't super tight with so I had all this anxiety leading up to it. I stressed over what suits to wear when, planned out all of my outfits strategically, and then the trip finally came and as soon as we got to the house and wanted to jump I the pool, I just didn't give a shit. 

Because we were all in the same position. We were all being vulnerable with each other; there were quite a few 'fit' friends there with us but a lot of people with similar body types to myself which was a really good feeling. We all just jumped into the pool together and ran into the waves and, okay sure I'm probably idealizing it BUT basically as soon as we were there and it was happening, all that planning and strategy and fear kind of disappeared because I saw I was in a group of non-judgmental people who also had bodies they didn't love. We were on the same page (not that anyone really said anything.)

I hope you have similarly great friends and that you have a wonderful time! I know it'll be hard to stop the anxiety now; it's a lot of pressure, I know. But things will be okay and I hope you can keep your chin up! Lots of love and luck!"

If I don’t shower every day it gets so limp and pieces of it are straight and others tight curls. It often looks flat at the roots so I have to puff it up all the time with my hands. I’ve tried adding a part but the roots are completely straight even though I just had the perm done about a month ago. Just feeling frustrated and very unnattractive.

Ultimately I don’t think it should be nor will it be 18+ (just cause it can also be SUCH a broad topic) but I value this opinion and it does make sense to me. And in a lot of ways, I mean, look at my now - I’m just 19, things that are hurdles or brand new for me now will be nothing in a couple of years.

When it gets bad like it is now and I start to feel suicidal, that's when I begin to cancel future projects, plans, tell people I can't make it, delete new fun projects, etc. I've been absent on social media for work, past all deadlines, and basically just trying to get through the holidays."

It gets easier for me to talk about, but it’s weird because I am suicidal again now. That was so long ago - I wish I had done it then. I have so many responsibilities and attachments and obligations now. Back then I had nothing."

Target,f9ilup5,t3_e59vv8,1575340280.0,"It’s tough because it does vary store to store. I work up front and hours fluctuate for us a lot; only a few guest service team members get close to 40, I don’t usually make 30 (I’m a student with another job though so I’m fine with that.) that being said, I know fulfillment team members who easily get 40+ hours a week and they like it that way. Really depends on your location. It’s probably better than Walmart though."
BPD,f9iccok,t1_f9ibqy5,1575333588.0,"Thank you for replying to this, it was very nice. You have a very good point. I struggle with this a lot - I also have schizophrenia and I have a delusion that other people and things are not real. So sometimes when I’m sitting there and doing very bad, I not only think they are preoccupied but I also do not think they exist. Thankfully it is not constant though - I know I just need to remind myself to talk to someone.

I don’t unfortunately. I have an appointment with my regular doctor January 9th to get a referral to a therapist but I plan to commit suicide on January 7th."
BPD,f9ic6eu,t1_f9i9q1z,1575333465.0,Thank you for your kind reply. I definitely use reddit the same way - I only started using it around two months ago and I honestly feel like it’s helped a lot. I use Daylio now and journal around every other day so that’s a nice resource I have :)
