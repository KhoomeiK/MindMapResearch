scarlxrd,foys1rg,t1_foyk99n,1588178119.0,Seems like most of the complaints are about the beat tbh
scarlxrd,foyj0ak,t1_foyiph8,1588173397.0,For sure man
scarlxrd,foy0cbc,t1_foxzxk6,1588162018.0,Yea I see where you’re coming from but since it’s already announced I’m guessing he’s just going to be replicating the rage and shit from back then so he probably won’t be in the same headspace
scarlxrd,foxzagg,t1_foxz5qp,1588161147.0,"Yea I hope we get similar themes for dxxm 2, like maybe some similar trailers for the album like we got for the first"
scarlxrd,foxz6e4,t1_foxqqrk,1588161052.0,Fair enough man
scarlxrd,foxz5pk,t1_foxye39,1588161035.0,Yea I think he does really well on that track with Uzi too
scarlxrd,foxz3se,t1_foxnytz,1588160989.0,"Brutal man, but yea I guess there’s always room for improvement"
scarlxrd,foxz1pq,t1_foxn34j,1588160940.0,I feel the same I’ve never seen anyone talk about it and the music video to me almost feels like a transition into the dxxm era with how dark it is
scarlxrd,foxyyc2,t1_fownq6s,1588160859.0,From a quick look at his Spotify I think he try’s to collab with different artists consistently so I’m not expecting one but it’d be awesome if they did
scarlxrd,foxyt83,t1_fowmuss,1588160740.0,"Absolutely, let’s hope his feature on Trippie’s album is a sign of more to come"

Trophies,fo2dq6n,t1_fo1dn96,1587458492.0,"Thank you, I think I’ll be giving it a go as well"
Trophies,fo2dpcm,t1_fo22jfn,1587458466.0,Well I think you can get through a lot of the story pretty quick when you’re just grinding out missions. I’d say waiting for phone calls to do survivals is quite annoying though. I used the tactic of just waiting in or around any safehouse and not being in a vehicle to trigger the phone calls as often as possible.
Trophies,fo2djks,t1_fo2d0co,1587458297.0,"Yea there is, I believe there’s a work around you can do but I’m not entirely sure what it is as I got the trophy three years ago when the servers were still active."
Trophies,fo0yfx8,t1_fo0t1df,1587422155.0,Well that’s an impressive amount of platinums in the space of a year

Trophies,fo0ss5i,t1_fo0s3t7,1587419087.0,"Damn that’s quite some time, how many platinums have you gotten since?"
Trophies,fo0nyis,t1_fo0n8fp,1587416546.0,Well to be honest I’d already done all trophies except three in 2017. I just happened to return to it the other day and knew I could get the plat fairly quickly. So when it came to the last one I thought I’d get it on 4/20 at that time to mark the day in a way. I did the same with the leap year day except with that I just got a few bronze trophies on Far Cry 3.
Trophies,fo0n6ui,t1_fo0htyn,1587416142.0,"I will as always, hope you do too"

Trophies,fo0gefh,t1_fo0g4p4,1587412661.0,"I did it around three years ago when the servers were still up, I only came back to it recently because I had three trophies left that I didn’t wanna do. Sorry I can’t help man."

Trophies,fo0ejz6,t1_fo0eepe,1587411675.0,"Last night, I’d finished all the challenges and the next day being 4/20 thought i’d get the final trophy at a fitting time."
Trophies,fo0d3eg,t1_fo0cz5n,1587410720.0,"Me too, I imagine it’ll be much better to play on ps4 and therefore a more fun platinum!"

Trophies,fo08o8f,t1_fo08kez,1587408018.0,"Thank you, I’d say I’m split between 2 and 3 being my favourite but that’s probably just because there’s a bit of nostalgia for the second one."
scarlxrd,fnztm6j,t3_g4pjq6,1587400539.0,I love the transition at the end and the music video is great aswell

metalgearsolid,fmr8jzv,t1_fmq8n41,1586316447.0,"It’s been a while since I’ve done it but I think my method was to crouch behind the cover at the beginning of the mission, see where she is shooting from and mark her, From there I’d stand up and quickly crouch back down so she’d fire and then quickly enter the tank to fire at her. Also, if you aren’t already use one of the heavier tanks in the game."
metalgearsolid,fmq74mw,t1_fmq6wke,1586294115.0,Are you getting shot and killed before you can get into the tank or are her shots actually destroying the tank?
