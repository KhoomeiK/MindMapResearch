""SEOUL, March 23 (Yonhap) -- More than 2 million people have signed an online petition as of Monday demanding the government unveil the identity of a man who allegedly ran a group chat room where photos and videos of violent sex acts, involving underaged victims, were distributed.

At least 74 victims are known to have been exploited in the so-called Nth room case, in which a man surnamed Cho allegedly lured victims into taking naked photos and later threatened and exploited them into more gruesome sex acts.

Cho, who used the nickname ""baksa,"" which means ""doctor"" or ""guru"" in Korean, is accused of distributing the videos in a group chat room on the messaging service Telegram, where at least 10,000 users are suspected of paying Cho to watch the videos.

Police have so far tracked down 124 people in relation to the case, including Cho and 17 others who have been formally detained. The user who is suspected of first creating the chat room, however, still remains at large."

Mentally stimulating him will help a lot.. Puzzle toys like Kongs are awesome. Even smearing peanut butter on something he can slowly lick off is better than nothing! 
Try feeding him one kibble at a time using his food as rewards, OR instead of a bowl, spread the kibble out on the floor and let him grab them up.


Is there a neighbor/family membe/friend/younger sibling that could play ball with him at the park twice a week?

Is he kennel trained? Having enforced nap times is a life saver for our dogs. Gives me some peace and quiet and lets them rest. Dogs DO need naps! And high energy breeds like GSDs and our cattle dogs have such a hard time settling down even when they need to.


A lot of areas have mobile low-cost spay and neuter clinics, often around $50 for a neuter. Having him fixed should help his behavior and energy level, but not for a few months while the hormones settle (and tbh.. Some dogs don't change after castration)


As for walking.. Have you tried a harness or gentle leader (it's a head halter)? I know it's tough walking a puller, especially pregnant, so it's okay if that's out of question for now.


Is he dog friendly? Do you have any friends with dogs that would be willing to ""doggy sit"" him (at the park or at their home) so he could play with their dog? That's a VERY mentally and physically draining activity and he'll love every second.


Idk. I'm sorry.. I hope this is helpful"
