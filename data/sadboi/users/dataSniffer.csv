I just got a big pack of Stirling. I got Island mans body soap, and a full tub of Boat Drinks shave soap. Also a sample of orange chill body soap. The body soap is fucking incredible and I definitely will be buying more, their post shave balm also really intrigues me. That being said if you want a soap that is incredibly slick I would try the Seville. Just my two scents though. I am probably gonna our my Boat Drinks on the Bazaar."
wicked_edge,fr5cxi0,t1_fr5ccty,1589906493.0,That makes a lot of sense. I am still so new to this and finally started clicking with my B&M. I bought a tub of Stirling but I might try and sell it on the bazaar. Any DG scents that remind you of Seville? Or that you would recommend?
wicked_edge,fr59jb5,t1_fr58atw,1589904859.0,"Thanks for your reply! I just started bowl lathering with a ridged bowl. Good to know.

wicked_edge,fr55td7,t1_fr4tlfm,1589903017.0,"Have you ever used it before? 

Yeah it’s fine to use. But when you compare to a real nice shaving soap and proper lather there is no comparison. 

The problem is the nature of canned gel and cartridges is they are not designed to be easy on the skin. If you do I recommend shaving after a shower and using as much gel foam as you need. Don’t go over an area with you razor unless you reapplied the gel.

It also really depends on your skin type."
wicked_edge,fr4m8q1,t1_fr3f0zf,1589892017.0,"Yeah it’s easy dude. I am in 20s but first time I tried DE was in high school actually. My Freind sold me a razor and blade for like five bucks, I dont even think I used good soap, just aerosol spray shit."
wicked_edge,fr4lynx,t3_gmlmkp,1589891823.0,"Shave in silence. 

You probably need more water. Try and do only two passes of With the Grain.

For me it’s kind of always been either I have a good shave where it’s smooth and the razor glides, or it’s terrible and it’s pulling and tugging. I have been able to minimize the pulling in tugging by really working on my lather. Try doing some face lathering. 

Load up the brush. Apply it to your face. Dip the brush in the water and brush that into the lather already on your face. When it starts getting a little soupy is usually when you lather a bit more and it should be nice and slick. 

I was actually about to give up on shaving agin but I had a lightbulb moment and it was amazing.

I used to irritate my fave every time but now I can actually shave two days in a row if I want. 

I also recommend using an alum block for post shave. Also cold water. Splash cold water on your face at least three times after you shave. Then I do a pass with the alum block and let it sit for 30 seconds to a minute then wash it off."

Good to note that I am not alone in finding the subtleties between the two companies. I have very sensitive skin to begin with and it seems like Will definitely kept that in mine with the excelsior. 

Interesting to note, I did a lather this morning of an Arianna and Evans sample called Forbidden Fruit. I can still smell it on my hands. Which is quite remarkable because I took a shower since then with stirling soap and Shaved with my new tub of Boat Drinks. The smell is still pretty apparent when I bring my hand to my face.

Watching videos on people lathering and shaving. Especially hearing some of the soap makers talking about it and watching their videos. 

Will from Barrister and Mann has great information. 

Shaving in silence has been a game changer. 

The biggest though is really working the lather more and adding more water. Here in the pic it still looks a little glue like and sticky, it would probably be tugging for me. 

I would probably put some water on your brush and some more later and work more water into it and lather it on your face for a bit."

wicked_edge,fqplunn,t1_fqpjtoi,1589549374.0,"Yeah dude I would say my skin is pretty similar to yours. I actually dealt with ingrown hairs the entirety of college and acne again towards the end of it. And stopped shaving for a while. I have been DE shaving for a few months now every week or so and almost no ingrown hairs.

I also saw a dermatologist in February which you might want to do as well. I got this stuff Called Tretinoin from the Doctor and it really helps with my skin. I now use it after shaving and it is really nice. I don’t know if you’re in a situation to do something like that but it could help you. 

In addition I would recommend using some type of aftershave with some alcohol in it to kill and germs that could be causing anything. I was using this stuff called bump patrol for a while but it is quite ghastly. 

I have had sooo many issues but have had the least with DE. I think you will get better at it and your face will start being soothed a bit. Also pre shave is so important, gotta always shower, you probably know that. I also use a few drops of a pre shave oil, I think it helps. 

Do you have to shave everyday?"
wicked_edge,fqpjjy6,t1_fqpejuk,1589547919.0,"Keep at it. In my experience with skin issues from shaving it would take a month or two sometimes for it to totally clear up. 

I tried the derby blades and didn’t finish the shave, same thing with Vokshod, Shark, and Gillette. The only blades that have been okay with me so far are the astra greens. 

However, I have found that building a proper lather has been more helpful. I have started adding more water too it and now I am finally getting the razor to glide somewhat."
