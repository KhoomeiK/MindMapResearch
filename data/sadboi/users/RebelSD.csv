Your GPA is great. A 3.2 will get you into most good colleges. Some difficult colleges to get into may look for a 3.5+ but even then they look at many other things and GPA isn‚Äôt their deciding factor.

Your PSAT score was good and you can always study online resources on how to improve it. It‚Äôs not bad by any means.

Medical school is difficult to get into to begin with. Quite frankly I‚Äôd find a community college to go to that can help transfer you out to the college of your choice. You can save thousands of dollars and work on joining clubs/getting good grades that will ultimately impress the colleges more than an SAT score. 

I didn‚Äôt take the SAT, left high school with a 3.0 and didn‚Äôt do any extracurricular activities. I ultimately got into a great college because of my time at the community college and now I have a degree/wonderful job without any of the stress/debt.

Before this year my life was a mess. Last year at 23 I got skipped over for promotion at work due to nepotism and ended up leaving to what I thought was a better job. My first day was on my birthday and was too tired to do anything so I just slept. The job itself seemed great on the outside but once I started doing it I was miserable and I was barely making 1/3 what I was before. In between then and now I got robbed for over $2000 of my camera equipment and still have yet to get justice. Super depressing and nothing good right?

Well I tried my best to just keep going through the motions and stay positive about any little thing I could. 

Since that time (less than a year) I was offered a position at a school because of the work I did at the shittier job. They said even though I was qualified with the degrees, my attitude and passion made me more than capable. 

I got some degrees from school I didn‚Äôt even know I was going to get and then I got accepted to a university   I didn‚Äôt even want to apply to because I thought I was too dumb for school.
