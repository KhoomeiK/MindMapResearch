depressionregimens,f4971kp,t3_djvyuq,1571458348.0,"I've been on about 8 different meds too. was trialing them for the past 5 years. Then I tried zoloft. I've been taking it daily for about 2 years now and it's the longest I've been taking anything. 
it's quite interesting how they say it takes 2 or so weeks for it to really take effect. but when I took prozac and zoloft for the first times, I felt a definite change in psyche almost 15 mins after taking it. 

Same goes for when I suddenly stop daily zoloft. about 3 days to a week in and an incredible sadness and depression kick in. So scary... 

It's different for everyone but this was my experience. Maybe the proper therapeutic effects start after a few weeks coupled with a good lifestyle, but there is definitely an immediate effect for me too."

There seems to only be clinical trials with Ketamine at the moment. The organisation is called Black Dog Institute. With enough votes we can push them to engage with medical centres and begin Ketamine treatements.  Me and many others are in desperate need for them.
