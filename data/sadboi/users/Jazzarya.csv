In short, more accurate scores because the test is easier to take on pencil and paper.

My kindergarteners are still learning how to write and read letters and numbers. Then throw an iPad at them with a clunky, horribly designed app makes it worse. 

One of the apps we use has a “read the question” feature (helpful because my students can’t read at this Level). However, it also reads the problem number and other functions (basically any word on the page).
