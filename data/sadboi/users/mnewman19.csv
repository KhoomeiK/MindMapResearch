I don't attempt to defend some of the acts committed under the USSR and China. For example, Stalin's treatment of the lgbt community was abhorrent (although Lenin did legalize gay marriage in 1917 before he died in 1923 and that was reversed). 

However, I would push back on the notion that you can define a system like socialism or capitalism by it's death count or number of genocides or any metrics like that. If we're going to start making a tally, socialism and communism don't even *come close* to capitalism in terms of death count. 

Under capitalism, we had both world wars, the entire history of middle-eastern violence since the 1800's, the genocide of native Americans, and oh by the way the entire African slave trade.

But you won't see me criticize capitalism for those reasons because it's not a useful metric."

Was it perfect? absolutely not. Did Stalin, Mao, etc. do a lot of harmful things? yes. But by pretty much all metrics, did both countries experience the greatest economic growth and pull the most people out of poverty in the shortest amount of time the planet earth has ever seen? Yes.
