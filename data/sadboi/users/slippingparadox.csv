Games,fpl7nw1,t3_gdv427,1588707818.0,"I played the originals up until Wasteland (which I still found mildly fun). 

I personally prefer the Skate method. Skate captures the feeling of practicing a line until you get it just right in a way that Tony Hawk never did. 

If I had to play a new skateboard game it would have to have as solid of skating mechanics as the game Pipe does for BMX (the game is basically a playable demo/example for the real game coming out). PIPE's focus on tight and satisfying physics and control of the bike make it infinitely replayable on a small map just because that ""let me get the line right"" feeling is there. 

Skating in real life is about repetition and honing in your skills to progress. Tony Hawk never really captured that. 

I think there will always be a tiny market for crazy action games but it seems like people now want the ""feeling"" of these sports in their games rather than gameplay that feels arbitrary set to an action sports background."

If I were you I would look at the Reface CS. It is DEAD simple to learn and easy to make usable sounds almost immediately. Theres also a (finnicky) looper onboard. This would be like a 1/4 of your budget leaving you room for something like a drum machine and an audio interface. And yes it makes warm pads.

Remember you will need an audio interface, a daw, and (relatively) decent computer speakers if you want to make songs/record shit on your computer. If you blow 800 on a synth you will be stuck listening with headphones and unable to record anything you make if you don't already have these things."

rareinsults,foywy1x,t1_foxon6c,1588180716.0,"Why would someone be so vocal about one specific type of music?

His argument is that rap only contains rhythm and not harmony/melody therefor it isn't music. He is blatantly wrong in this regard but the real question here is why is he picking on rap so heavily. He has mentioned it like an absurd amount of times. He also has discredited rappers as doing something ""that doesn't look hard"" essentially downplaying the entire genres musicality and effort. 

He doesn't pick on ambient music. He doesn't pick on guitar solos. He doesn't pick on an individual violin piece. These all lack components from his magical triangle of music and yet they get a pass. 

The frank answer is the Rap is the one popular genre in the world (the most popular genre to be exact) that is associated with Black culture. Ben does not like Black culture.

Ben is a racist guy. Thats fundamentally the problem here. He specifically does not like rap because its music by and for black people that, over the last two decades, has become the most popular music in the world. 

He thinks you are stupid if you think rap is music (source: his twitter). He is a racist piece of shit that thinks Arabs live in sewers (source: his twitter). The only reason he can get away with saying shit about brown people like that is that its semi-socially acceptable (in certain groups) to be racist against brown people. Its not acceptable to be racist to black people, at all, so he tip toes around saying what he really means by coming up with this laundry list of reasons why rap music sucks or isn't legitimate. He cant actually say what he feels so he pulls out his dog whistle because out-in-the-open good old fashioned racists eat this shit up. It gives them an excuse, an out for not liking music from black people. A shield in public if you will. 

I make a lot of assumptions in my argument but let's get some things clear. He is racist. There is no fucking arguing that. No one says ""Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage"" and is not racist. He is also BLATANTLY wrong in his psuedo music theory garbage. So combine the fact that he is 1) an open racist 2) purporting fake music theory to back up his argument and 3) targetting the most popular and main source of black culture in music. This all adds up to him being pretty fucking see through when it comes to his actual intentions."

for reference as well i am using the stock ableton live lite grand piano instrument with no plugins on either the track or master channel. the problem seems to be alleviated if I turn down the master track or the individual track"
cringe,foohis7,t1_foofkte,1587939062.0,"I typed out this whole response to you but your take is just so deluded its not worth the effort. Lets let conmen and snake oil salesman have a moral pass too while you are at it. You are literally defending the siphoning of money from poor, uneducated folk into the hands of a millionaire that leverages his position in the faith structure to bring in more money. 

You are as seedy and slimey as him to be frank."

Responsibility just feels like an added layer to deal with. I can barely handle my own brain with absolutely no responsibility added on top."

tattoos,fon9o0q,t1_fon4v5s,1587915199.0,">	people only want it because they’ve seen others with it in this location

Who are you to say why OP likes this location? Also, what if she did see a similar tattoo and liked it? What is so wrong with that?

You don’t know her motivation.
 
You aren’t the “originality” gatekeeper."
tattoos,fon9hly,t1_fon4v5s,1587915094.0,"Every body part you can think of has been tattood already. So that’s a weird criticism. 

Maybe you don’t like the combination of style, shape and location? Because just hating on it not being an “original” location is stupid seeing as there are no original body parts left to tattoo."

holdmyfries,fol33qk,t1_fok8yht,1587853934.0,"Also don’t bring a crew of people unless you run it by the artist. They are probably used to it by now but generally speaking it’s nice to run it by them. 

Plus, tattoo appointments are so much nicer without a crew of people. You go in, chat with the artist while getting tattood, then bounce. No awkward standing around, no people hovering over the artist, no comments about how it doesn’t “look right”, and no taking a shops seating up.

Edit: maybe if it’s your first tattoo or a meaningful one or you and your friend are getting matching ones, then I kinda get having people around. But after the first tattoo the nervousness is minimal and you shouldn’t need “support” after that"
