AskAstrophotography,fr09598,t3_glx05a,1589787630.0,"Hello! So I took and edited this photo of the star Arcturus with Muphrid to its lower right with my phone. I heavily edited it in an attempt to bring out more stars. My question is, when you zoom in, you can see more of what look like stars. Is this accurate? Or is it just a result of “editing” and perhaps light pollution?"
love,fm1n2of,t3_fsa1gi,1585681400.0,"I am in your exact same position. It’s definitely a bit saddening to know she likely won’t ever love me like that, although the fact that she DOES love me in general and says I’m her favorite friend.. her favorite person in fact.. it’s still a powerful feeling. I’m glad we’re able to at least rejoice in the privilege of being their friend."
BPD,flv3wvj,t3_frb7u2,1585515841.0,"Yes. I tend to feel threatened even by familiar people. Especially when it comes to my FP.. I want her to make friends and to expand her horizons, but I’m always terribly anxious about being replaced or forgotten. It’s a constant internal conflict."

So might as well alleviate a bit of this burden by channeling it through memes and shit posts. Whether people choose to react or not, I don’t care any more."

Life feels so pointless and although yes, we can make what we want of it, what’s the point? It’s perhaps a result of this mental illness, but nothing seems worth it. And even if it does, that feeling is always fleeting. It’s inevitable that we’ll fall back into these hopeless mindsets. I don’t know. Everything is so exhausting."

The only thing that was uncomfortable was the constant attempt at sexual harassment. I know Kazuma was shamed for it by the other party members, but trying something on a young girl while she’s asleep? C’mon.

But then again, what else can you expect from anime? That’s all it is."

don’t do it, man, i know things are tough but i’m sure u can find things worth living for, if only for another day
