I agree with Dad here, because I did this.  And it wasn’t a mistake because we lost money.  It wasn’t a mistake, because we lived together so we f*cked more and had a kid we didn’t want.  It wasn’t a mistake because we overspent ourselves into being house poor.  All things things can happen to anyone who buys a house.  Didn’t happen to me.  

It was a mistake because behavioral economics is a real thing, and the age of 22 isn’t an age when most people’s personalities are settled.  Dad says your life sounds like it’s in flux.  Our psyches, at 22, are in flux.  I learned this the hard way in terms of houses+love. And since we are what we think. Dad’s right.  Your life is in flux whether you want it to be or not.  Congratu-f*ckin-lations on the successes you’ve already had in your life.  Sounds like you’re killing it.  Great job being responsible and intelligent with your time, and for looking for new opportunities. 

Dad has laid things out here really well.   After my long term GF and I broke up for really good reasons.  It wasn’t easy getting her monetary interest away from the house we bought.  After it was all done.  I, in fact, bought a duplex and had my tenant paying my mortgage.  Still own that place. My wife says I should stop worrying about money, because I’ve never not had it. She’s right.  It’s not about money management here. Sounds like your got that down.  Like you assume, the financial benefits of buying a home with your cash are potentially real.  So, I say, go for the duplex.  But, do it on your own.  

Dad is right.  It’s a job being a landlord.  But, one unit isn’t going to mess you up, and you need to learn somehow.  20 years later, and many properties later, and a happy family life later.  The only thing I’d change is that I would have listened to my own dad who told me the same thing Dad is saying here.

Maybe your life is short, but it can be sweet.  There are certainly old people who just don’t like being old, and they wish they took more risks when they were young.  They live to be 100, but spent years 70-100 watching TV and playing candy crush.  Who knows?   I can only speak for me.  I have longevity in my family, so I spend some mental energy on this question almost everyday.  

I’ve never been one to think you should mortgage your youth for money, if you can help it.  FIRE is great and all, but be prepared to not FIRE exactly when you want because of shifts in the market over time.  

There’s that “time” problem again.  

I watched older people cry in 2008 when they realized they couldn’t retire how they wanted. 

There are people who have FIRE’d at their magic 4% only to realize that costs of living where they wanted to live “forever” shot up, so they have to rationalize retiring somewhere much cheaper and then just vacationing to where they wanted to actually live.  Screw that, IMHO.  

After much shopping around, I decided to buy property where I want to live.  I rent it, because I have a job where I don’t want to live, but I like my job and it pays great.  One day relatively soon, I’ll flip flop. I’ll live in my rental, and still work a job I like, but probably for less money.

Why not speculate on everything, then, if they’re speculating on a lay off that hasn’t happened?

Companies furlough to not lay people off.  If the company is run well, then they’d just lay people off instead of using furloughs as a “prequel” because the company has a better hand on its numbers. 

The lending system has never made “sense” with their “profiling”. I just got another loan for an investment property and I always marvel when they ask me for copies of leases of my other properties. As if they don’t know that a tenant can just choose to not pay me at any moment they want, and they know how long evictions take too.  In the middle of a deal I did a long time ago, I lost enough tenants to lose about 40% of my income there.  Still closed the deal.  

Does it make sense to count that rent as reliable income for loan repayment.   Nope.  But they seem to treat it that way.  Why?  #Murica. This country is built on cheap debt.  If this lender balks, you’ll find eventually who won’t.  

The key to rejecting a loan is current liquidity  and credit history.  If you have enough cash to cover a year of payments, and you have no defaults on prior loans, then you’re golden.  They sell your loan after taking 12 months of payment, and then you’re someone else’s “problem”.

With IF, people can regain some control over this.  We all still may be tempted to eat pies, cakes and cookies, or fried chicken sandwiches with donuts in place of the bun, but by limiting the time we have to do it by 60 or 70% really changes the game.

Don’t take more than 800 mg of ibuprofen in a 4-6hr window, for example, could be applied to Mountain Dew.  Don’t consume more than one can in a 24hr period. Don’t mix with other sugary products.  This wound make more sense on the long term healthcare side of things.

I think OP is looking for some simple advice from those of us that have been doing this for a long time.  

OP:  Calculate a 25% vacancy rate when assessing future buys.  This will give you the cash you need to weather this.  

I like the $50 a month idea.  I usually do $100.   Paying something is better than paying nothing when times get tough. You’ll need to work this out with the tenant with a goal of not taking zero for an answer. Collect something so they respect the fact that they have a contract with you.  

Each tenant is different and subject to income disruptions whether there’s a virus or not.  Keeping your budget assumptions at a rate that accounts for higher variances is the way to go. So if you need two months to remove someone, you’re not hurting on the backend.  

The RE books used to recommend 5% vacancy rates.  That’s a bullshit lie.  25% is more realistic as you go on and get more units.  Every good investor keeps cash to whether storms.  It’s really the only reason to keep cash."

This isn’t being stupid.  It’s being picky.  And this is a house sale here, not something tiny like buying a used coffee table or something. 

Here are my tips as a RE investor that’s had to deal with smells. 

1.  Bleach sucks.  People think it’s magic.  They think it kills mold. It doesn’t. It kills lots of stuff, but it doesn’t do everything.  What you need for your floors is pine sol or something with a strong lemon smell.  Lemon = clean to lots of people.  You can try odoban too. 

2.  Only way to truly get rid of smells is to get rid of the source.  You could shave the dog.  Hair grows back.  Or. Cut back some of its hair.  There may be internet ideas that aren’t harmful for reducing dog smell.  Maybe there’s a special dog lotion or something you could use.  You don’t need shampoo that cleans oil off the dog.  The oil will just come back in 2 days.  Mammals are oily.  You need something to mix with the oil that’s not harmful to the dog.  Maybe a coconut oil thing.  Not sure on that one, but I am sure that there are a million pet sites out there and dog smell complaints are common.  

3.  Do not get an ozone machine and turn it on while anything living is in the house.  That’s dangerous. If you have enough time to prep you can run and ozone machine in the house before showings.  That may work. 

4. You could use a scented powder on your carpet—again, pet safe. Something you can vacuum.  

5.  You could keep the dog in the garage, if the garage is nice enough.  

The good news is you’re only a week in and you’re talking about potential offers.  You’ll probably get and offer by months end.  There’s a dog living buyer out there somewhere.  I lost my sense of smell for a whole year once. Scents weren’t an issue for me.  That buyer is out there."

Paying off a mortgage makes sense to me only if you plan on keeping the property long past the mortgage payoff date either to live in or rent.

And, ultimately, some people like new designs instead of old, and may even think the exact opposite than you about old designs.  What you call “historically significant” they could say is “ugly”.  An owner who tears down an old home is guilty of taking the appreciation of something historic away from everyone else.

Regardless, there SHALL be a Midwest hub for tourism, finance, healthcare, and rail logistics.  This is Chicago—not St. Louis (the idea  laughable)—not Milwaukee (it’s even colder)—not Indy (no Great Lakes)—not Detroit (Robocop is Set there for a reason).  

If you want max rent and appreciation, it’s in the west loop traveling directly east till you hit the lake and then north on the coast till you past Evanston.

RealEstate,ff9ue59,t3_esfhrm,1579721562.0,"Besides location, location, location ... which is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH...

The only one I’ve heard of that makes sense to me is that for rentals, your buy price is ok if you can rent for 1% of that buy price. 

So, if your market dictates that $1000 is the average rent for a 2bdr house, then the more you pay over $100k for the house, the more you’ll be UNprofitable.  

Of course, some people buy property to bury equity they have from another sale.  Some folks buy property as an investment first and then live in it later—seeking raw appreciation.  Real estate, to me, has more complex motivating factors for lots of small investors vs. stocks.  

Using something like CrowdStreet?   That’s all about the numbers.  They buy complexes with investor capital based in a multiple that’s 1% or less of their purchase price (per unit rented) in hot markets and then they start collecting rents.  
The lower their multiple, the more profitable they are.  

So right now, in a hot market, it’s really hard to make money in real state without having a lot of money first.  During the recession, this situation was flipped, because in hot markets rents didn’t drop that much."

My grandfather wanted to give me his house after he left to downsize. No way.  It was/is huge, and in a declining part of town.  Needs at least 200k in repairs due to size.  Yuck.  He had 8 kids.  WHY would I want 8 kids? Who wants 8 kids today?

I don’t know if the future “needs” a great balance of ages, but I can see how an engineer like Musk would want to try to create a system to guarantee this scenario ala Brave New World. 

People have lots of options for what to do with their lives besides raise families. If the government wanted more babies, they can incentivize their creation.  Babies are still easy to make.  Who has the desire/will to want to take care of more than one or two? That’s the problem I see.  

Right now, in the US, people can have fun, not raise kids, and save money since kids are so expensive.  Why would people pick otherwise?  Loneliness, I suppose.  I don’t know. Family members can be a real problem sometimes.
