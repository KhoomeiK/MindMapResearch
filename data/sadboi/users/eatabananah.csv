depression,fim2ksb,t3_f8egtz,1582516449.0,Do you feel neutral about everyone too? Apathy is a symptom of depression...it can even be considered a type of depression. You also seem to be the kind of guy that wouldn't hate anyone.
depression,fhq7khe,t3_f44bah,1581800384.0,"You're not alone. Sometimes, I wake up during odd hours of the night with pining thoughts of death as though even asleep I can't escape thoughts of suicide. This past week, I was sleeping in a co-ed hostel. In the bunk over was a man that believed he was the son of Queen Elizabeth II. He also believed he was a Rothschild. I wondered what trauma had caused that delusion. Maybe sexual abuse as a child? I knew one man that believed he was both part wolf and could astrally project; he was raped repeatedly as a child by his uncles - both sodomised and forced to perform fellatio as a child. There is so much pain in life. I can understand the want and willingness to die, but I think we should just as equally take the chance to live authentically as well as courageously. Take a chance at living. If you could do something or hope to accomplish anything at all, why not try and be consistent about it? Even serial killers abandon all morality and future freedom to enact their deepest desires. As someone with deep feeling who hates suffering in this world, you deserve more than anyone to seek a life of passion - even if sporadically."
depression,ffeclb4,t3_et1fhk,1579843164.0,"For those of you that have found depression has been a lifelong battle, I want to remind you that it's an actually disease that cannot be cured or beaten. It's just as real as schizophrenia or mania. It's as real as arthritis, diabetes, cancer, etc. There is a part of the spectrum wherein anything but lithium orotate or mood stabilizers such as Lamictal specifically will work. The rest only serve as a way to more or less manage functions ans progress."

Something like this...

Although it's preferable to find a place where the water content has high lithium/magnesium.

Boulder, CO has hot springs and there are salt spas and sound chambers in the area as well. You could create an itinerary."

depression,fdozfpi,t3_ee58qm,1578616390.0,"I'm sorry that you overheard that kind of conversation. I really feel like that is her own way of coping with your depression. Over the years, I've come to realize that my mom, especially, but also my family and friends as well have been affected by my depression and [soft] bi-polar disorder. I have a twin brother with acute schizoeffective disorder. Our illnesses have taken a huge toll on my mom, on our personal lives and relationships in a slew of differing ways. If he weren't so sick, I wouldn't have been able to acknowledge how my own symptoms and psychoemotional challenges affect the people that love and care about me. Hard times don't always bring out the best in people. Sometimes, it's good to give the people you love a pass and focus on devolping the ""don't take things personally"" skill. I understand that it was your mom and that would most likely hurt a great deal, but it does help people to talk about the hard stuff in a lighthearted way. I've seen people blow up in rage and anger when they're feeling hurt. Sometimes, we just have to find people we can talk to or take nothing personally. ""There is a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you take nothing personally."" -Don Miguel Ruiz"

domesticviolence,fcmary8,t3_ehqelc,1577768959.0,"You've been through a tremendously destructive ordeal. I'm so sorry that you've experienced this relationship. I can relate to what you're going through - it's going to take time, self patience, and a good deal of energy will need to be devoted to healing from the trauma that's occurred in your life. Maybe you'll continue to be lonely or you'll be full of self doubt. Perhaps you'll even be suicidal again. Maybe he'll say he's changed and try to coerce you into a relationship again after everything he's done. You'll continue to feel humiliation, but you can survive it all. You might suffer from flashbacks and have difficulty sleeping. Maybe you'll have nightmares or find yourself weeping. I know you can thrive if you remain indignant. Those people are accountable for their own behavior. They're demented and despicable. They're immoral and disturbed - even worse. Please know that you can rediscover and reshape yourself at any time in your life and that your existence does not need to overlap theirs. Please do some yoga. Emotional pain has a way of affecting your physical health as well. Yoga will help heal you overall. Also, there are boards on Pinterest that help survivors of violence and sheds light on challenges with psychemotional health. It will help with anxiety, obsessive thinking, ruminating, and processing. Focus on your diet. Drink lots of water. Focus on nutrients that repair the nervous system. Find yourself a support group and interact with them. Find people that will validate the anxiety and depression that this relationship exacerbated and caused you, then look for people that augment what you love about life. Take good care of yourself."

domesticviolence,fcfo9h7,t3_egfcge,1577632193.0,"It's bs that therapy hurts an officer's career. As far as I'm concerned, he's admitting with his statement that his issues do stem as far as chronic abuse (and maybe even rage - who knows?) because a doctor (i.e. therapist) would be legally obligated to say that the officer isn't fit for duty if he is abusive. That is the actual perceived threat in his mind. The doctor would have to come forth and say that people aren't safe or that there is some sort of risk to the public. It is the only time HIPPA and privacy laws can be violated. 

I would say there is a serious issue regarding the children's well-being. The mother needs to do something about this with some urgency. The children need to feel safe enough to speak up to trustworthy adults or they will begin hiding it as well. The more it's hidden, the safer he'll feel in doing worse. I think involving other family members and doing things discretely that will help reach the mother is a solid first plan. Secondly would be contacting state children and family services. I just wouldn't want to alienate any of the family members by violating their privacy so to speak. Going directly to such a severe plan by contacting social services may not have the ideal outcome. He may become extremely defensive and isolate his new family, and you'll never know what's going on in the household."

relationship_advice,fabz9f3,t3_e86sm0,1575931110.0,"I think the point is that we have to be true to ourselves and sometimes when we want to remain close to others or make decisions influenced by our need to be close to others, it isn't and objective, unbiased decision. There are many cultures that tell young adults to separate themselves from others for some time so they can find themselves - their true selves. The true self isn't really a result of upbringing, it's about the choices we make as adults that shape is. Our upbringing only allows us to grow into a person that should be able to thrive anywhere. That's what adult guidance (families) are for, to help us navigate through life, but act as an anchor."
domesticviolence,f9iqqxx,t3_e4usla,1575343717.0,"I have a black eye from my bf as I type this. I have to go to work tomorrow, and he is surprised I won't take the day off because of it.

The truth is I know he won't change. He has a history of abuse and he doesn't talk about it like he's ashamed, he talks about it like it was necessary and justified. There is something blatantly wrong in his moral cognition. He's been escalating lately as well. This latest accident proved that I know I need to find a way out, but I need to do it so that it's the least psychologically damaging for me. I can't just get up and leave. I wish I could. 

Can you? Can you just get a cheap apartment somewhere and move out this week? What worries me is the psychologically damage. Every single day, I have to constantly remind myself that he is sick and that he will do this again. I have to remind myself of how he escalated situations and how he turns and manipulate the smallest things into something sinister. He's almost paranoid."

relationship_advice,f94n0cc,t3_e3p7ca,1575094099.0,"This really, really sucks because I have a feeling she's not truly an abusive person, but, then again, I could be wrong. It really does seem like a compatibility issue. 

I grew up with a mom that liked and needed things a certain way, and I had to learn, as I grew up, how to do things to the standards she expected. My dad tried early on in their relationship to make her happy, but it was impossible. There were many times I couldn't do things to her expectations, and I was chastised often. I was affected by the way she spoke to me and what she demanded from a child. 

My mom has a heart of gold, and would give anyone the shirt off her back to help. As a child, however, I think she used me for two reasons, as her helper because she had little control over her life, and to hurt my dad by denying him visitation. I really needed my dad. He is easygoing, and he can be funny and adventurous. My mom neglected me to a degree because she had to work so much. When she did talk to me, she had a chore. We didn't go on family vacations, and I spent my summers home alone, doing chores. I had no hobbies and no guidance. I got a great education, but I struggle with social skills. I get panicked often. I get nervous and anxious.

I don't know if you can change the dynamics of this relationship. I don't know if you can bridge the gap of incompatibility, but I'm not sure it would be the best thing for the children to be in her permanent custody.  Adopt the little boy so that, if there is ever a divorce, you have legal rights.

Don't lose your temper with this woman. She'll go down swinging. It won't be worth it. Be true to yourself. If you're ok with the way you do laundry and paint, find someone that will love you because you are thoughtful enough to do it. Make sure that you can create a life for those kids. They need you as you are and will love you unconditionally. I may have taken a few liberties, but I do see so much of my mom in your wife, and it's a warning."
relationship_advice,f94lmy9,t3_e3hj3q,1575092589.0,"I think you should widen your friend circle. Friends are like family, so I don't think you should distance severe the friendships, but make new friends. Make your life richer. Meet other people that are helpers too.

relationship_advice,f94j247,t3_e3lfv1,1575089951.0,"My bf does this to me all the time. I always tell him to stop ""groping"" me. Then he disagrees that it's groping, and nothing is ever resolved.

He has never understood, and he will never understand. He hasn't stopped. We've been together over 8 years. I've been telling him for 8 years. 

He's a playful guy and does it in a playful way. He has absolutely no idea that it's not just disrespectful, but it's psychologically damaging...that's the degree of the discomfort I feel when he does exactly what you described to me. 

He wants to get married. I don't. He wants to have children. I don't. I think there is so much about our relationship that can be deduced from this one thing alone. He's often childish. (He has a childlike side I adore though.) He's disrespectful quite often. (This is just one example.) He's broken my trust... 

He can't control himself, and I think it could turn out to be a bigger problem. There is something inherently disrespectful and crude about it. I think there will be many more things he'll do because he's capable of this disrespect."
