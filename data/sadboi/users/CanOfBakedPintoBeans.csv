AskReddit,f3zvjl8,t3_dismux,1571278010.0,I struggle to write essays for school. For example It took me 5 days to write a 4 page paper. It's not because I suck at writing. It's due to me getting constantly distracted by my social media or youtube.

AskReddit,eu7zwts,t3_cez7p8,1563546726.0,"Long story short I was very hungry and I was very stressed out from school I was eating my sandwich peacefully and then all of a sudden my bully comes and slaps it out of my hand which causes me to push him like I've never pushed anyone before and probably never will and there was a look of confusion embarrassment and fear in his face ever since then he left me the fuck alone. The End.
