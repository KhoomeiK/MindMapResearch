I secured myself all A's this semester, which is great, and since none of my grades can drop, I can focus exclusively on my 5 AP exams (well now one is just a digital portfolio thing for computer science). I want to do well on my exams and I'm glad I can skip the busy work. I do what's helpful, along with using the resources AP is posting on youtube

Of course, my non ap classes are choir and virtual history. The choir teachers are uploading some sight singing stuff but no one has any reason to do them and I don't think they expect us to. Also the choir department is extremely ""political"" and my directors hate anyone who isn't popular and in the varsity show choir, so I don't really give a damn about pleasing them. I've been playing piano for 12 yrs, I can read music. There is literally no point in doing their assignments. My virtual class isn't taught so I dont feel bad for not doing that either. 

I do most of the assignments for my ap classes but I take em at my pace. My English teacher specifically told us not to do things that won't benefit us. In my physics class (physics C) we finished the material but uhhh his teaching isnt the best so I'm doing the online AP vids and starting from scratch for E&M. I use the free responses he uploads and work them when I'm at that part in the curriculum, but its often different than the due date so I don't always turn them in."
