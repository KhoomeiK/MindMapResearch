I've been approved but had most of my weeks dissapear then reappear only to once again disappear as well. Ive been unable to get a hold of them on the phone a single time more have they replied to any of my emails. Oh and the virtual assistant is a joke.

Very soon I'm going to be losing a lot more than a place to live and they dont care. I've read stories where people filed 2 weeks ago and already are receiving payments 1 week ago and getting payments. Can someone explain the order the look at the applications? Is it by last name first or submitted date? Because I want to know why it feels like I did in grade school always being called last because of my last name being W.
