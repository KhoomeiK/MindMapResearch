therapy,fm788nh,t3_ftid2y,1585816866.0,"Well it's been the same for me. I've been in a 5 years relationship (my ""first love"") and afterwards it took me 3+ years to really like someone new.
Guess I had to make peace with myself and the situation and probably my brain needed its time off.
And more, I used to be overthinking so much about how I'd like to have a new and beautiful relationship that there was a lot of pressure there, making myself feel the same way you do, like there's something wrong with me and such.
I sincerely believe I was more in love with the idea of being in love and always looking for the ""right person"" to replace my ex boyfriend, which made it more of a task rather than the ""magical"" feeling love has to be (at least that's how I felt when I knew for sure I was in love).
What I can say for sure is that after I stopped trying so hard and thinking I wasn't doing something right and breaking up with everybody I thought I was in love with for a week, it took some time, of course, but I am completely in love with the guy I've been with for the past year and it is a more mature relationship and it's a lot healthier and what I'm saying is, hm it will probably happen randomly."

As for this matter, keep your body healthy as you should anyway during this period and respect all the hygiene norms so you don't catch it from someplace else, or in the worst case, so you don't give it to other people.

I had to be given a shot after getting injured into a rusty metal thingie and after around 12 hours this thing appeared around the area where I've had the shot and it's now the 2nd day after and it looks like this (I've read 8/10 people get something like this).
I'm not entirely sure if it grew, but it's red, hot and swollen and it hurts if touched. Other than a bit of tiredness (which I also read it could be a common side effect), there are no other symptoms. 
I wanted to make sure it's normal and eventually get adviced on how to make it better faster.

What I've noticed through the years is that the later I wake up/the more I sleep (more than 7-8 hours), I just feel so much worse and tired and not like myself/not at the full potential so maybe try and fix your sleeping pattern and don't rely on pills on the long run."

Counseling is not necessary taken seriously here since we have 1 counselor for a few thousands people. :)

I'm not ignorant or something and I've studied my ass off, but everybody keeps telling us practice is going to be a whole different story and that university doesn't prepare us for it at all and I was just hoping some extra insight from methodological books would come in handy. It's not a situation I've gotten myself into.

Thank you so much for the recommendation!

EDIT: we don't really have a different job for a school psychologist and a school counselor. I can start working after the 3 years if I pass the practical and theoretical exams and how I truly don't want to do more harm than good, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible outside of the courses and I'll start my master's at the same time, hoping it shall make a difference and fill the ""voids""."
medical_advice,fj62298,t3_fbo9xd,1583052863.0,"NOD. Just wanted to share the fact that from my general knowledge, even if tea is healthy/good, too much green tea can cause side effects because of the caffeine and too much tea, in general can lower your intake of some types of minerals/vitamins and make it easier to eliminate them from your body.
I'm going to quote the first article I found online on the issue:

""Green tea isÂ POSSIBLY UNSAFEÂ when taken by mouth long-term or in high-doses. It can causeÂ side effectsÂ because of the caffeine. These side effects canÂ rangeÂ from mild to serious and include headache, nervousness,Â sleepÂ problems, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, irregular heartbeat,Â tremor,Â heartburn,Â dizziness,Â ringing in the ears, convulsions, and confusion. Green tea seems to reduce theÂ absorptionÂ ofÂ ironÂ from food. Drinking very high doses of green tea isÂ LIKELY UNSAFEÂ and can actually be fatal. The fatal dose of caffeine in green tea is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). SeriousÂ toxicityÂ can occur at lower doses.""

Accessed here: [GreenTea] (https://www.rxlist.com/green_tea/supplements.htm#)

EDIT: I read about you drinking tea in the comments below and it, indeed, seems like quite a lot of it. *Not judging, obviously, just thought that maybe, somehow, considering your weight and eating habits, and the general effects alcohol has on one's body, it could somehow interact with it all making it worse (just an opinion)."

I'm not exactly sure I understood what you are trying to study (are there 3 variables you want to study at once?) and if it was as simple as my answer is going to be you would've probably known the answer already, but if I got it right though, the t test for independent samples compares the means of two independent groups, where the independent variable is measured on a nominal scale and the dependent one is measured on interval/ratio."
AcademicPsychology,fiwv6vd,t3_faapmp,1582804389.0,"The closer r (correlation factor) is to [-1,1], the stronger the correlation. 0 means no correlation. ""+"" and ""-"" will reveal the ""direction"" of the correlation (I am not exactly sure of the English terms) and the intensity of the relationship is shown by |r|. 
If |r| is greater or equal to |critical r| then we decline the nule hypothesis and accept the research hypothesis, otherwise we accept H0 and decline H1.
There also is the r^2 (the coefficient of determination) which will show in percentiles how much of the variability of a factor is caused or explained by its relationship to the other factor.

- regarding Pearson correlation, but there are some other types of tests and I wouldn't ask myself about those 'cause I'm still a newbie :).
- also keep in mind that correlation doesn't mean causation."

P.S.: if you are concerned, talk to someone, otherwise don't become too self-aware and keep checking them since it does no good to yourself. They usually get swollen and back to the normal size, just doing their job and such without a need for you to be concerned."

Considering psychological stages of development, there's always such a moment. At this age we're becoming more and more aware of ourselves, more than we've been beforehand, when, as our friend stated above (at least that's how it went for me as well), teen-agers spend most of their time partying, living irresponsibly, being caught in unnecessary drama I wouldn't consume myself with at this point, rather than thinking so much about time passing and life choices and more serious topics.
