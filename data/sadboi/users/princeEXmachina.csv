Even as a transguy (FtM), my shit gets the ~40+ replies but a large majority are all geared towards sex, or one sided romances that never really include accepting me as a person. That, and being 22 years old, I end up being primarily targeted by men no less than 10 years my senior. It sucks. Sure, being LGBT has its own bunch of problems, but for both female to male and male to female, if there's a pussy or even the slightest inkling of femininity, the worst of the worst flock the fastest, with all the genuine ones either buried under other replies or even met with skepticism since my track record with men has left me questioning not only otherd, but myself.

Many people come here because of how harsh more in-person approaches can be, whether it's shyness, anxiety, or past trauma.
