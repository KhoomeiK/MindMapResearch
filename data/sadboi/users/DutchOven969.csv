ptsd,fk3ikv7,t3_fg2pjj,1583835239.0,Y'all are too kind! Thank you!
ptsd,fk21fzj,t3_ffsfm2,1583791123.0,Literally every night and I don't sleep because of that.
CasualConversation,fjymsu5,t3_ffej8w,1583700134.0,Interesting thought. For me it's less about that and more about the ways people find it problematic. I'm trying to synthesize that.
CasualConversation,fjy25g2,t1_fjxxn0c,1583688312.0,The other things is that as a queer Mexican I'm always political. It's impossible to be a-political. So also that in my head while making a decision that will properly represent why I'm starting this and the various communities the station interacts with. üôà
CasualConversation,fjy1su5,t1_fjxvw40,1583688112.0,"I totally I see that. I haven't been able to focus on the name very much due to grant apps and state forms I've been swimming in. I've also been a little overwhelmed because moving forward, every decision I make will have unsatisfied people. I'm trying to navigate between what I think is right while still ensuring that I'm listening and sticking to my mission. That said, some other posts showed me that I could manipulate the two words into something that might work!! Thank you for your words and time!"
CasualConversation,fjy1f7j,t1_fjxyatn,1583687896.0,Thank you for your words! I've heard from this perspective before and have carried that with me. I'm moving toward some manipulation of Marginalized and sound so as to take back control. This feed though has been super helpful.
CasualConversation,fjy19tu,t1_fjxzaux,1583687808.0,Thank you very much for your words! I see your point and am a big fan of Margin Sounds or some other way of playing with the two words.... Thanks!
CasualConversation,fjy14t4,t1_fjxxn0c,1583687731.0,Thank you so much!!! I really appreciate your words!
CasualConversation,fjxugt6,t3_ffej8w,1583683620.0,Also the station is meant to support underrepresented sound artists and their fans***
CasualConversation,fjxuf5y,t3_ffej8w,1583683589.0,I'm also now casually questioning the line between music and journalism at the station.
diyelectronics,fju1vvz,t1_fjts140,1583612807.0,"That is an accurate description. I did not build any of the electronics on the picture. I am on this subreddit because I know there are a lot of sound artists on this subreddit who would like to engage with the station and share there work in the future and possibly support it. I am hoping to engage with the diy electronics subreddit in this manner. As far as I know, the subreddit rules allow that!"
diyelectronics,fjtqwwd,t1_fjtp4p9,1583610194.0,I run everything as an amateur radio person. Once we launch well also be featuring artists who build custom network performances and mics from scratch on the station. We will also be broadcasting their work live.

diyelectronics,fjomdgn,t1_fjohz5k,1583530677.0,Totally hear you. The only reason I joined the community though is that I still use analog recording gear to broadcast and produce sessions.
