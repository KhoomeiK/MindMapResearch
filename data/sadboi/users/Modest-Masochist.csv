legaladvice,foj3jh1,t1_foj1ui0,1587806948.0,"To be honest, I'm just looking for any truthful/honest answers, so I really appreciate you taking the time to write a response. I figured what you stayed re: the legality of moving items/changing locks would be unlawful, so I greatly appreciate you confirming that. Again, I doubt my Mom would have the heart to do this, but I just wanted to be sure that, yes she can get in trouble were she to do that... she's just at her wits end with this girl, and is sorry she extended her hand to help her in the first place... she's of the mind that ""this is what I get for helping my fellow man"", and I just feel so bad because I'm the one that convinced her to open her home to my friend... I had no idea this would come of all this, though... I just wish my friend wasn't being so manipulative, and now that we're in a spot where there's pretty much *nothing* my Mom can do other than rely on the word of someone who has already gone back on their word several times... it's just a shitty situation, but you know what? My Mom should have already done this years ago. She should have already put in the eviction notice years ago, and it's no one's fault but her own that she waited this long. Of course no one could have foreseen a pandemic, but that's exactly why she should have done this months/years ago...

Anyway, I'm pretty sure my Mom will put in the eviction notice for April 30th, and just go to court whenever they open back up... until then, she'll just have to deal, not much else that can be done. It sucks that her kindness is being taken advantage of, but she should have put her foot down long before this became such a huge issue, and all we can do at this point is be supportive and give her as much information as possible on what she can or can not do.

You mentioned paying my friend to leave sooner, that's kind of the point I made near the end- My sister and I offered to loan her money to get a deposit on a new place, and she won't take it because ""she'd feel bad owing us money""... tbh it seems like a bullshit excuse to avoid doing the right thing, so I'm sure she'd say the same thing to my Mom... Even if she didn't have to pay the money back, the fact that she has to put in the effort to find a new place and move to that new place is too much work it seems... but, I don't see what she's expecting to happen, for my Mom to just give up one day and accept the fact that she'll never leave? It's just laziness combined with arrogance, plus knowing there's nothing that can be done on top of it... 

Just a shitty situation, my Mom is the ine who should have done something by now, but my friend should just be doing the right thing and moving out, and bottom line, I feel like crap for talking my Mom into this in the first place... so... idk, just gotta hope for the best I suppose...

Thank you again for your time- sorry for the second rant in my response haha... certainly appreciate your help."

No no I'm sorry, this is just a joke. I understand your problems seem to go much deeper than just ""making simple changes"". All I can say is, you really just need to make the most of every day. Being lonely and feeling disconnected certainly doesn't help, but I can assure you, no amount of friends, family, SO's will ever fix your loneliness. It's something you have to come to terms with, and trust me, it's not always easy, but the real issue (sometimes) is learning to like yourself. I learned how to have a healthy admiration for myself- not too cocky, certainly not rude or brash, just being me. It didn't rub everyone the right way, but the people it did attract to me liked me for who I was- an honest, personable, caring human being. It helped me find my wife, and now we're looking to have kids... but I'm slowly seeping into that black hole again, even with such awesome things going for me in my life, I'm still incredibly lonely.

I know it might not be much, but if we can help each other when we can, I'd really enjoy helping each other out. I'd be happy to just listen, give advice (only if you ask), and help us both reflect on things to try and make sense of our time here.

AskReddit,fh2koc5,t3_f15nbj,1581256242.0,"Was molested by my sister when I was 8.

Was dating a girl for three years, she got drunk at a bachelorette party, came back and wanted to have sex in our car. I didn't. She got her way. I told my friends about it, one said ""oh... she just wanted to be with you."" Another said ""did you have a hard on? Yeah? Well then it wasn't rape."" I came clean with her the next day, and all she did was cry and tell me it was my fault for ""letting it happen"". We broke up a year later.

As I was working my last day in a doctors office, one of the nurses who was thrice my age pinched my ass and proposed we had sex when my shift was over. Now I can't get a reference from the place.

I had to quit my last job in the medical field, one I was at for 5 years, because the new manager kept kissing me after our one on one meetings. Idk if it was meant to be sexual, but when I told her it made me uncomfortable, all of a sudden, I was no longer listened to in meetings, no longer allowed one on one meetings with management, and was twice looked over for a promotion I had been promised after 18 months of service.

It hasn't been good. Sometimes I just feel like it's all my fault for letting it happen, and because no one ever took me seriously anytime I brought it up. I haven't worked in two years because I'm afraid of being put in similar situations. I'm just tired of feeling disbelieved, powerless, and ignored."

They’ll give you an EKG on the spot and that can at least give you peace of mind until your appointment. Unfortunately, I do have to reiterate to be sure you’re an ESTABLISHED PATIENT. Talk to someone you know there, and if you’re a newer patient, call one of the nurses on staff before going in. Speak calmly, tell them you are not having symptoms of a heart attack, but your heart has felt weird, and to have an EKG before your appointment may help ease some concern, prior to your appointment.

What it *SOUNDS LIKE* (Not a doctor, just giving advice, please still go see your doctor) is anxiety and stress mostly caused by your lack of sleep. RLS can be a real pain in the ass, so it’s important to treat it so you can hopefully relax. I went to a sleep specialist, and after a sleep study (unfortunately it seems to be just part of the process), he RXed me Ropinirol, https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ropinirole.html. It didn’t help me sleep necessarily, but it did help with the RLS big time. Especially since it’s not a controlled substance, your MD will be smart enough to help treat your symptoms so you can sleep.

Being social, meeting new people, putting yourself in a position to cultivate new relationships is much better than giving in to your depression, and eventually giving yourself disproportionate amounts of alone time, due to fears of you being a burden, or a drag on those around you. I feel like this is one of those things you not only should continue, but for the sake of your mental health, *need* to continue to pursue. It will help you stay sociable, it will help you get to know this girl better, and knowing that you’re not in a position to have a relationship right now can actually be a blessing- it takes the pressure off of you, and can hopefully have an easier time being yourself.

I just don’t think you should rob yourself of a human connection, regardless if its future potential, due to your current mental state. You can still form and grow new relationships despite you current state of mind, as long as you’re convinced that you’re working on a way to progress your issues.

Opiatewithdrawal,f3drtw8,t3_dgliqm,1570845187.0,"So sorry to hear about your discomfort... if you are already feeling constipation, there’s a good chance you’ll feel WDs after this, though they will be light compared to what a lot of people feel. My suggestion is to slowly taper yourself by halving your dose every day. The best thing you can do is try to go at least 24 hours between doses, and keep trying to cut it as much as you can. The symptoms you’ll probably deal with are insomnia, nausea, fatigue, and maybe some night sweats... but if you are smart and taper yourself, you should be just fine. Also, if you can get yourself to sweat, you’ll be able to release those toxins quicker... keep hydrated, keep sweating, and you should recover quicker.

If you take this medication more than three days in a row, you can experience some sort of WDs. This shit sucks."
Showerthoughts,f2zgl68,t3_desstu,1570520623.0,"I mean... I guess it really depends on what you see as smart... 

Peggy Hill is a teacher, a boggle champ, and while of course she has some ignorances and issues, I wouldn’t call her stupid, just unfortunately placed... it may even be something the show subtly tried to state by showing how held back she was by her upbringing, and her current life. Hank obviously knows a lot of factual knowledge, but he uses those facts to justify means that, and usually does, have the opposite affect, or worse, on his particular outcome. If he was as smart as his wife, a lot of his issues would be easier for the shear fact that he doesn’t waste time hemming and hawing on whether the boy is right or not. I certainly am not knocking the character or the show here, and highly admit I lack knowledge of the majority of the series, though not the main character.

I don’t think Linda isn’t as smart as Bob, I think they’re both equals, almost as two equals can ever be. It again comes down to “what is your definition of intelligence”, but there are so many things that one just picks the other up for... Bob is forgetful and Linda remembers more. Bob is smart enough not to commit murder, but if needed, Linda is smart enough to get away with it...

My tiebreaker comes down to who teaches their perspective the best... who has the skill, tact, patience, communication skills, and desire to teach their craft to those around them. 

In a TV show, at least...

Thoughts?"
Opiatewithdrawal,f2x290q,t3_delvsz,1570472947.0,"Honestly I’d suggest reading past stuff on the sub, get this question a lot, lots of great answers here.

Kratom seems to work well for a lot of people, but you gotta be careful with it, it can also have it’s set of WDs.

What seems to work best is a mix of marijuana, CBD, vitamin C, electrolytes (Gatorade, pediolite), benzos (again, can cause WDs, careful), and exercise. The sweating is really important, because you’re going to sweat either way- your body has to rid itself from toxins- so force the issue. Don’t just sit around and accept your withdrawal. Be strong, push each other to keep pushing forward, and be sure to ask for help from those who’ve gone through the same situation...this is really best done in person rather than over the Internet, but of course, to each their own.

Good luck man... I’m so sorry to hear you and your partner going through this."
Opiatewithdrawal,f1z313c,t3_db81lk,1569832155.0,"Don’t put anything into your body unless you’re 100% sure. Better safe than sorry. I’ve heard way too many horror stories of medical professional who don’t know what the fuck they are talking about, giving bad advice with things like this.

Do everything you can to wait it out until you can talk to someone in the morning. I’m sorry I can’t give more concrete feedback, but if you really can’t find an answer by this afternoon, PM me and I’ll put you in touch with someone I saw recently... I’m not sure where you are, but they should at least be able to give you a straight forward answer on something like this.

I’m sorry your medical professionals failed you to where you had to resort to a public forum for answers. This country’s medical system is fucked beyond belief (assuming you come from the US)."
Opiatewithdrawal,f1ywgpj,t1_f1xikas,1569826455.0,"I’d be careful with the grapefruit juice man- I’ve heard it can make it a lot more potent, but it doesn’t work for everyone. The problem is, if it does work, you may not know until it’s too late, which can lead to very big problems. The fact that your body may be more used to the Kratom, your tolerance may be as such that you could be safe, but just start real, real slow man- like a tablespoon at most.

The bitch of it is, drugs like Kratom have been around for centuries, so there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence, but very little scientific evidence, if any at all. All the info that is out seems almost too coincidental in my book... the CDC says it’s harmful, the FDA wants it illegal, the DEA is pushing to put it on a banned substance list... My point is, they put so many other drugs through trials to test their safety, why can’t a natural substance be tested in the same manner, so we as a society can become more informed, and don’t have to risk OD due to insufficient information? My opinion? Because it could lead to a cheap, natural remedy for opiates. 

I’m not trying to get all conspiracy theory, but just think logically- there’s literally an opiate “epidemic”, with the leading cause of ODs due to a drug called fentanyl, a man made narcotic that can be 100x more potent than heroin. We KNOW how dangerous heroin already is, yet here’s a drug being used for medical purposes, that’s “somehow” getting out to the public, killing opiate users who may not know what they’re actually getting, again, due to lack of information, regulations, and support from the medical community. As deadly as this drug is though, there’s no clamoring by the FDA, DEA or CDC to put it on any banned lists, are they? It is on the DEA’s schedule list, though, **AS A SCHEDULE TWO DRUG**. You know what’s schedule one, though? A category that’s supposed to be saved for the most deadly and addictive drugs in the world?

Marijuana. Rant over.

I can’t say I can compare American medicine to any other country’s healthcare system, but for a “first world country” to have as many problems as America has... there’s obviously more care being put into profits over people, and it’s just sickening, no fucking pun intended, to have to force millions to suffer due to greed, negligence, fear, and corruption.

I’m sorry to hear you had to be yet another victim of misappropriated medical care."
Opiatewithdrawal,f1x0wd9,t1_f1wpvoy,1569792086.0,"Hey dude, how long have you been using it? I’ve only used it once myself, but I’ve read a lot about it on r/opiates, r/kratom, and so on. It definitely seems to have an addictive element to it, because people have talked about withdrawals after using it for a while, just as people have with opiates. I’m hoping to try to add it into my daily routine to stop the opiate use, but I don’t want to just add another potentially addictive substance to my life...

I’ve heard that there’s two dosage types you try to go for, apparently if you take smaller dosages, you get a speedy kind of feeling, similar to coffee or stimulants. If you take a higher dosage, you get sleepy and relaxed. Seems odd, but that’s what people have said about it, so I assume that’s what people mean by “find your dose”... I’m assuming you need to take more until you get that tired and relaxed sort of feel- capsule might work better for you than the powder.

Also, depending on what you’re using it for, I’ve heard the “red” strains are better for WD symptoms. Let me find a link to see if I can give you an example...

Tbh I’d just google it. Be careful man, I’m sure that the DEA and FDA just want to make it illegal for their own reasons, but it is possible to OD on it, apparently. Be careful out there homie"
