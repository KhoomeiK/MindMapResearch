AutisticPride,fo8upzv,t1_fcxkup3,1587604240.0,you also should keep in mind autistic people do go through alot of torment in there  lives and are sadly alot of the time treated horribly! It's not like being positive is a bad thing but just keep in mind autistic people usually go through WAAAAAY more pain and suffering than the average person they JUST do like not everyone but most people. your partner may be focused on negative shit because alot of negative shit may sadly happen to him alot.
AutisticPride,fo8u4p1,t3_ej20lc,1587603885.0,your right this is disgusting and it's not like SOME autistic people aren't jerks but in all honesty MOST of the time its TOTALLY the other way around normal people are usually FAR bigger jerks to us than we are to them NOT ALWAYS just most of the time. NOT ALL normal people are jerks to autistic people either but alot of the time unfortunately they are

They need to learn the definition of the word SPECTRUM as well some people suffer SOOO much more with it than others it is JUST so WRONG for the higher functioning people to say it isn't that bad when the people who have it more severly are suffering HORRIBLY non stop there whole damn lives because of it! I am so sorry you have to live with this fucking hell as well! :( have you ever tried going on a gluten dairy free diet for autism? I heard that helps some people I am going to try it I heard taking turmeric with black pepper to help it absorb can help with autism symptoms as well you may want to talk to a doctor first about how much turmeric to take as I am not sure but we may as well try it! It says eat nutricious foods as well like lots of leafy greens and broccoli I HOPE it helps my whole damn life was waiting for death as well and my few friends and family have been SO helpful NOT they act nasty to me and act like autism is just ""introversion"" and ""not that bad"" bastards! well they can just come and have fun cleanin up my DAMN DEAD BODY then if this diet doesn't work i am fucking out of here! again I am so sorry for you this is truely horrible times a hundred billion!

SuicideWatch,fkoinqv,t1_fknsfs3,1584387985.0,"I KNOW right?! Why is it so hard for others to realize not everyones life experience is the same? SOOO many people think that we all suffer THE SAME and we do NOT while it is true that we all suffer we do NOT ALL SUFFER THE SAME! some people suffer SOOOOOOOOOO rediculously much more than others unfortunately i'm not saying  people who don't suffer as much don't deserve love and support with there problems BUT at the same time it's really JUST WRONG for them to act like there temporary problem that lasted for a month or two is the same as someones PERMANENT problem that lasts for a LONG TIME if not there whole life the whole suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem is the most obnoxious quote ever it makes me think the people who quote it are either completely uncompassionate or completely utterly clueless. It also pisses me off how people who have had a great life with minor temporary problems has the balls to tell someone who has been through HELL there WHOLE LIFE that it's there own fault there unhappy and that all they need to do is just CHOOSE to be happy and they will be. Again those people are either have there head on the moon or are just complete dicks i'm not quite sure which but it is irritating as hell and I wish SO badly I could let them live someones life who has to suffer horribly and let them show me how they OH... so  simply ""choose"" to be happy.....THEN!!! I am sorry your suffering so much I wish I could  do more for you I can tell you I don't want to live either at least not too much longer your not alone wish I could help more though and ya people need to be smarter and more compassionate!"

SuicideWatch,fkoh1t7,t1_fkmucgn,1584387065.0,I KNOW right?!?! And They think that its just OH SO EASY to get help but I can't understand how they don't get that not everyone's problems are even curable it's BEYOND ME how they think everyone who is suicidal can just take a pill and get better that's SOOOO not true sadly :(
SuicideWatch,fkocqgs,t3_fir9m2,1584384596.0,"I KNOW right?!?!?! I mean what the HELL?!?!?! why in fucks name should we keep on ""living for others"" when were in pain and agony all the time. I mean it's not like we chose to live this god damned life anyways! We were FORCED into it so why in the fuck should we stay?!?!?!?! And I mean is it not selfish to make someone live a life that they absolutely fucking HATE and DON'T WANT TO LIVE?!?!?!?! EVER thought about THAT peoples?!?!?!?! I am NOT even saying I don't believe in suicide prevention I do.....BUT ONLY if it's an ACTUAL POSSIBILITY that there life ACTUALLY CAN get better!

&#x200B;

Sadly for some people help just is not even a possibility sadly not everyones problems just MAGICALLY ""get better"" even if they work super hard at it alot of people crazily seem to think that if someone  is unhappy and miserable it's ALL THERE FAULT and if they just simply CHOOSE to  ""make changes"" in there life things will ""get better"" well guess what is NOT how life works for everyone unfortunately! There are ALL KINDS of different reasons people are suicidal FOR THE LOOOOOVE OF GOOOOOOD PEOPLE'S....NOT EVERYTHING IS CURABLE OR SO EASILY FIXABLE!!! And the sufferer sure as HELL does not need to ""live for others"" I mean WTF?!?!?! It's not like I don't feel BAD for my friends and some of my semi nice family members and I MAY live for ONE more decade for them BUT when I told them that they told me I need to live my WHOLE LIFE so that would mean five six more possible decades of this god damned life that I hate and THAT made me REALLY mad! How DARE they tell me to do that?!?!?! Especially when there nice to me sometimes but alot of the times they laugh at me and poke fun of me but respect eveyone else?!?! How DARE they tell me to live when i've lost so much IN LIFE and i'm in agony ALL THE TIME and if I died they would only have to deal with losing one person ONE LOSS?!

&#x200B;

 and at that it would be a person they make fun of and use and take for granted as well not that they don't have sweet moments BUT still i'm fucking tired of being made fun of and not being as cared about as much as everyone else why the HELL should I keep living for others to keep getting that sort of shit? And ya I completely agree with you this whole ""living a miserable life for others' shit is SO obnoxious! Sorry for the angry post but it's been an awful awful life and hearing people tell me I need to live five six or so more fucking decades for them made me absolutely sick to my fucking stomach! It's NOT that I want you to die I REALLY don't BUT I would be a hypocrite because someday I for SURE am going to kill myself more like free myself I wish I could do more for you but I guess all I can say is i'm so sorry and your not alone"

I agree some of these comments are really mean the I hate my brother makes me sad I wish they would say I love my brother hate the autism instead.

I have autism and it's caused nothing but suffering in my life I wish my mother had aborted me the people who say no one should have an abortion should try living with this for a day and they would change there minds PRETTY QUICKLY! even if we can't detect autism we could detect other things that would cause suffering. If life will be nothing but suffering or the vast majority of it will be suffering then why not abort and make the pain stop? doesn't make sense.
confessions,evklpsq,t1_eodvroz,1564583326.0,aspergers is a living hell it's not getting to participate in life basically not getting to most likely ever date or have friends or at least comfortably be able to hang out with friends having your mind constanly blank out and not know what to say to other people and get left out in the cold your whole life. and having to deal with terrible sensory issues is hell on earth! His freakouts are very understandable givin his situation. If you haven't already I'd suggest watching the sensory overload video called i'm not naughty i'm autistic on youtube it can help you get inside his head more. I in NO WAY am saying severe autism is great but the situation your son is in is not a gift or blessing in ANY WAY! hoping for treatments so we can find some relief!
confessions,evkkirn,t1_eoea5q1,1564582844.0,you are absolutely correct I understand the quote high functioning autism seems like it would be better but people just DO NOT realize how much pain we go through I wish they could get in our heads and feel how tormenting it is the isolation HAS gotten worse for me as the years go by! It sucks! All I want is to have romance and a couple friends or at LEAST to be able to comfortably hang out with people! Is that really too much to ask? I just hope for treatments that is what keeps me going!
confessions,evkjtbb,t1_eodc82v,1564582553.0,low functioning autism is not good that's for sure but for the people severly affected by aspergers there lives are bassically being locked up in some damn prison getting abused and ignored alot of times never get a relationship with anyone or even have friends there whole life it is HORRIBLE and no gift at ALL! Maybe it is for the highter functioning aspergers people but for the lower functioning people it is a curse from hell!

And lots of people are suicidal or kill themselves because of it and if a treatment can give them some relief, improve there quality of life and even save there life then it really is very important for treatments to be found! I think everyone should do what works best for them if they don't want treatments then they don't have to take them and if they want treatment then they should be able to have treatment."

I mean why curse innocent people with this shit? Why not curse hitler or ted bundy with it? Even Hitler and Ted got to be in relationships and be loved but innocent people get to be alone forever and abused everywhere they go there whole life?!?!?!?! WTF? :( I wish more people who know they could pass this down wouldn't reproduce or if they want kids adopt I know many that keep poppin out autistic kids and I mean if they adopt they could be doing a service for a kid but if they make an autism baby that kid will be tortured so why not adopt?

confessions,evj8bjc,t1_eod76r7,1564557412.0,and please realize in my comments to the siblings I absolutely am not saying they should be ignored and that there needs shouldn't be met i'm just really hoping I can shed some light into what it's like to be the autistic one it breaks my heart them saying they hate there sibling. Being the sibling is NOT easy But they should realize they can still date be loved funtion in society have friends while acutally being the autistic one you get ignored and bullied and most of the time don't get to date and deal with extreme physical pain and horrible sensory issues and it's just terrible going through life being so unloved and unwanted bassically everywhere you go and sitting and rotting in your own perverted prison while watching everyone be loved and have partners and friends. I just wish the siblings would try and put themselves in the autistic persons shoes and be very happy and very grateful they get to be normal they really did escape from a living hell! again NOT saying it is easy but I hear them talking about how they get ignored alot at home and again not saying thats easy. but they don't seem to realize autistic people may get attention at home (hopefully) but get ignored everywhere else they go in society there whole lives bassically. and will most likely not get to ever have a relationship or maybe not even friendships it's a WHOLE other level of hell being the actual autistic person I am sorry if I piss people off but i'm speaking the complete truth. please try and put yourself in your siblings shoes! I know if they are violent it wouln't be easy to be around but please just try to have some compassion for these people there lives are so unspeakably painful please hate the autism but not the person please!
confessions,evj6kro,t1_eod6fl2,1564556439.0,I think you hate the autism not your sibling Autism is SO painful to live with I cannot even describe it Imagine if you grew up and realized no one loved you except (hopefully) your family and you got treated like you were worthless sack of scum everywhere you go your whole life and had to be humiliated because you can't communicate with people and had terrible physical pain on top of it and heard all noises at once and other horrible sensory issures. please try to have some compassion for your sibling i'm NOT sayin you haven't suffered in life but autism is in a whole other league of suffering by itself!

I'm not saying there needs should be ignored but they need to realize they can communicate they can have friends they can date they get to be loved they get to LIVE i'm not saying the siblings don't suffer but the actual autistic person goes through a hundred thousand times more suffering and that's on a good day! I'm sorry to be so blunt it might piss people off but it's true the siblings don't even BEGIN to understand how lucky they are and what they escaped from! This truely is pure hell on earth!

I am sorry you feel neglected at home but at least you can find friends and a partner and move on and start over your brother may have had your parents attention but he will most likely never get any love or attention from anyone else his whole life. your brother didn't just lose his childhood but he lost his whole life to evil autism sadly :( plus the poor guy has to deal with schizophrenia on top of it! I know his violence would be very hard to deal with i'm not saying it isn't but at least you can move forward with your life he cannot :( It breaks my heart to hear you say you hate him. I think it's honestly more his illnesses that you hate and not him.

I am not trying to be mean I just feel like sugar coating it and saying it will get better is false hope and possibly meaner! They might as well be prepared and not get a nasty surprise ya know?

And it goes SOOOOO much deeper than not having a partner I have autism and I can barley keep a one minute conversation going with anybody so I can't even really simply hang out with people and just have fun so I am isolated bassically in prison my whole god damned life and feel like killing myself constantly. I know you are just trying to be nice but It honestly sucks so hard I can't even describe it! Autism is the root of all evil! That's all I can say!

I am almost 30 and never had a boyfriend and really wanted one! :( hardly any friends get fired at work for not being able to communicate watched all my peers get married have fun enjoy life while I get abused non stop almost everywhere I go I have met SOME people who are kind to me but most sadly are not. I get made fun of or told to get lost by almost everyone. Am forced into isolation every god damn day. terrible sensory issues feel suicidal NON STOP this autism crap REALLY is basically straight torture it's really like being locked up in a god damn prison. BUT on the bright side they are working VERY hard on treatments I don't know if it will be a full on cure but first ever treatments would be ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! :) it may be a few years idk for sure how long but it's at LEAST something positive to look forward too!!! :)
