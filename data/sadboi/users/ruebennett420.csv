ADHD,fqocq4t,t1_fqobsi2,1589512324.0,Yeah that's what I've been doing this week. Probably going to be a boring weekend. Thanks for listening.
ADHD,fqobjsh,t1_fqob5fv,1589511604.0,"My dad yelled at me because I had a lot of missing assignments and said that if I don't pass all my classes, he'd take my car and ground me the entire summer. So I got caught up in every class but this essay is required to pass the class so it's pretty important."
ADHD,fqoaxxf,t1_fqoait3,1589511236.0,I have to write a 3 page essay about *Night*. If you don't know what it is it's an autobiography of a teen's story at Auschwitz. It's really interesting and I wish I wanted to write about it but I didn't read any of the book cause reading is impossible. Idk usually I can get off fine but I'm more nervous about this one cause my entire summer is on the line.
mentalhealth,fq90cy8,t3_ghfc5u,1589181141.0,"this is the thing people fail to understand; sadness is not a fixed, constant thing in the world. if sadness had one definition, than everyone who fell under that one definition would be ""sad."" but, sadness is a feeling, that literally every single human on earth feels, so how can it be subjected? how can someone completely ignore anothers sadness because of their current situation? it makes literally no sense. one of many major flaws in our society."

depression,fq8lqyh,t3_ghdi7l,1589169194.0,"this is so true and for me adhd as well. i see it a lot more tho in life cause everyone is like ""work hard and your dreams will come true"" but its sometimes impossible for me sit down and actually do any kind of work at all. then mix that with the fact that adhd lowers ur dopamine and i literally just feel like meh whatever or im crying. its weird to think some people can do a lot of work and not feel like theyre being tortured and then feeling happy about it after."
mentalhealth,fq7d838,t3_ggs39f,1589144879.0,"wow. that was a beautiful read. I just want you to know, you are so brave and incredibly strong for not ending your life that night. always remember that."
thanksimcured,fq3ickm,t3_ggovgl,1589066765.0,"this is good. people feel like all hope is gone all the time. instead of ridiculing someone for losing hope and motivation, and claiming that they aren't trying, why not use some empathy and look deeper into how they feel? that feeling of being at rock bottom can destroy you and can actually convince you that you'll never feel better. though, when you're at the bottom, the only direction to go is up. it takes more than just some ""advice"" for someone in that place to find meaning in their life again."
ADHD,fq3gswz,t3_ggbek4,1589066298.0,"omg same! all they had to do was yell at me to ""motivate myself"" and it worked!! what a miracle."

euphoria,fpecqrs,t1_fpeb3c8,1588544931.0,"i mean i'm not addicted to it, it's just that my adhd brain that panics all day about getting things done gets nothing done. i just like a nice bowl after a long day of hating myself.

i appreciate your concern though :)"
euphoria,fpe8vt8,t3_gcvqer,1588542691.0,its become the only thing i look forward to unfortunately

euphoria,foqta5b,t1_fopoixw,1588000429.0,mouse is dealing a lot of prescription drugs. it's not super common but there are a lot of corrupt doctors out there who write fake prescriptions and get a shit load of pills to sell to drug dealers and make more money behind the lines.

euphoria,folft94,t3_g7pngr,1587861306.0,"I partially agree with this. the only thing i didn't understand was how she could be diagnosed with bpd at such a young age, though it is still possible. even though this show kind of takes a subjective view of sam's life, it's still 100% real and it does happen all over the country and world."
mentalhealth,fokvb3o,t3_g7zq6x,1587849632.0,congratulations! i'm happy for you :)
depression,fofxh1e,t3_g76n13,1587744525.0,dude same. idk i definitely still do think like this. throughout the time ive been depressed I always thought that maybe if something really tragic happened to me it would validate what i feel cause i have a pretty good life outside of hating myself. i also don't know why i do it and i dont want to do it but i do.
euphoria,foc7msq,t3_g6gmus,1587668054.0,"i thought this too when i first watched it. imo i think it was but i cant be sure obviously. also if it was planned, what a cool little detail by sam cause that is so relatable and definitely something me or my friends would do while trying to be quite lol."

mentalhealth,fnv32us,t3_g4149w,1587278627.0,"what helped me was opening up to my mom. For the spring and summer of 2018 i fantasized about killing myself. i thought about it every single day, and became so comfortable with it. I was going to do it at the beginning of the school year. though a friend forced me to see the school counselor which in turn made me tell my mom, and it was the best thing that happened to me. I learned that depression ran in the family and that she had expected that I was depressed. I also learned that she has had depression her entire life as well. I felt such a strong connection with her that i never felt before and it really helped me understand my life more. I just really didn't want to put her through me killing myself because I knew she was doing everything she could to make me happy. even if it wasn't like over the top and like her doing something everyday to try and make me happy, i knew she was doing her best. thats what stopped me from doing it :)"
mentalhealth,fnv274l,t3_g42tlu,1587277831.0,"I haven't had one myself but my friend had a really bad shrooms trip. And just to make it even worse I wasn't there for him while he was in it and I feel really shitty about that. though after it we really talked about it in depth about like the things he was feeling. It was a really interesting conversation and it made him feel a lot better about it. I think where you are at right now, you're still very fragile, and it'll take time before you can come full circle to it. like my friend was pretty shaken up for a little while. though when you're ready to talk about it in detail and really open up to what u were experiencing, I think you'll find it to be a positive instead of a negative. So my advice would be to understand that you're going to feel bad at first, but just like everything in life, it will pass, and the good thing about it is you'll look back on it as something that helped you grow as an individual :)"

depression,fmz0et5,t3_fy8a5l,1586501763.0,same. this whole school year ive felt like fucking nobody. i feel no emotions.

ADHD,fmljwqn,t3_fvxrwp,1586187871.0,im in highschool now and ive literally started to procrastinate taking a shower or something like that. my homework is basically off the table at this point. idk i dont necessarily *feel* lazy but people with an outside view would probably say im being lazy. i just really cant get myself to do things. idk.
sad,fmkpnc0,t3_fvtepk,1586163684.0,"i totally understand what ur saying. unfortunately, i dont know if i can help, as im fucking completely lost and i dont know what the fuck my life is or who the fuck i am or what the fuck im living for. before i go down a rabbit hole and say a bunch of random shit, i just want to let u know that even in this fucked up world, ur never alone. and if it comforts u, maybe it doesnt, but im suffering right alongside with u. i love you. lets all get through this confusing shit together."
