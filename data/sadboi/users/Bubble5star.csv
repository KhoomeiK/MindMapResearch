ptsd,fqwjnmk,t3_glbwg6,1589706885.0,"I’m not blaming anyone. Ok so cptsd can be misdiagnosed as ptsd, multiple personality disorder or bipolar. There’s a line. The line is the amount of endured trauma that has been endured over periods of time. Sometimes I feel ok with things and then other times I feel very uncertain and uncomfortable I also cannot do things maybe today, that I have done easily yesterday, memory is very sketchy a lot. It’s hard to say THIS IS HOW IT IS because it varies so much. Multiple head traumas and prolonged trauma is what creates cptsd. What I’m trying to say is that it’s really hard for individuals to understand let alone explain. You sound like you are trying so hard to be supportive but trying to explain away the way she feels is not ok. Accountability is that she’s uncomfortable in some way. Cuddles are always helpful, no strings attached. Derealization depersonalisation, flashbacks, nightmares, shakes, memory loss, weight fluctuation, burning head, somatic symptoms,  some of the things you could look up to help her or approach conversations."

It may take years for you to bE able to understand her. In any case perhaps when someone has been demoralised in ways, Maybe don’t roll her over and make eye contact the entire time so she knows it’s you and she knows she’s ok.

It has not helped my cptsd and I’d like to say it solved things but I take more pills now than ever. Hyper vigilance along with all the other symptoms, take time to work through. You can’t do it all at once. Which actually really upset me because. I just wanted to get it(the healing) over with so that I could be me. I’ll never be the person I was unfortunately their gone now we just have to work with what we got. The alcohol mixes nice with tablets and helps not to be present, because no one likes to think of themselves as broken. It’s not the most ideal situation and it’s something that takes time to come back from. If she just wants to drink there isn’t a real lot you can do but talk.

Asking all the time might just upset her more and talking is not always helpful. Don’t make her talk. Asking too many questions will exacerbate some situations.

The brain cannot digest it, there’s no emotional capability as the brain is living in hyper vigilance or in a somatic state, other states exist, derealisation and or depersonalisation. Feeling like your living in a dream, so in its place your amygdala grows, (living part in your brain) That’s why cptsd sometimes means you have to relearn how to cope or do everyday activities, showering, dressing, brushing teeth, eating or cleaning.

Clearly know what’s next and making plans for a week away but don’t dwell on it, or time, give yourself time to prepare in your head as sometimes it gives a better result. It’s a lot of self talk and self direction going through this is so debilitating.

You also may been enlightening him and encouraging a connection that you wanted but were not ready for, also it sounds like he may be doing that think that therapists do by helping you relive trauma in a way that you process. 
Maybe he feels for you, maybe he’s ashamed to get personal in such an unprofessional way.

CPTSD,fp9362n,t3_gbx0yj,1588412531.0,"I do that as soon as I think I’m ok with letting something out, I do. Then I feel exposed. I have been told this is because of the constant pain that you have felt for so long and so many times. You don’t want to be vulnerable because kindness is taken for weakness sometimes. So you build your reinforced steel concrete wall and stay behind it. It’s unhealthy apparently, can’t says I blame anyone for feeling that way, your strength will see you break your wall, brick by brick you will feel better about being yourself. It has been a lifetime for me and I’m still not there but keep trying. Everyone is different and some people prefer to speak about it and some don’t but only you can make that choice"

CPTSD,fp91wpk,t3_gbwt5c,1588411145.0,Who has the energy for that. I have kids I have study then there’s cleaning and cooking. Energy works on a 0 except when it’s on a 100 and there a thousand other things to do. Exhaustion is constant and a HOBBY might help a little but it’s life changes of what you want that make a difference

CPTSD,fp90r1u,t3_gbnpft,1588409894.0,"That’s not a helpful situation for you and if he can’t try to understand you(the way he continues to yell at his games, or speaks to you so disrespectfully like a shit) then it will not get better, he will not understand the continued energy and effort it takes to try to work through, it’s like calling someone lazy who has ptsd and co-morbid depression they literally cannot get out of bed, I’ve wet myself many times, not because I’m lazy or I like rolling around in urine but because cptsd is debilitating. 
You may not have a diagnosis but you know yourself and you know a bit about what happens to you, when your disassociating, that’s a start. You need support not putting down for not being able to control or regulate. I’m sorry it’s a hard situation. I just used to be the girl that was different the girl that no one understood and was like no one anybody had ever met. Till one day i spoke to someone and diagnosed me with cptsd. It made sense always feeling sick not being able to regulate disassociating, the punitive parent and screaming toddler that just wants to be held and reassured. had a breakdown and had to learn to do everyday care again. It’s a complete reboot, when your brains had enough. It tells you. It’s not helpful to continue to put it under pressure. Please be kind to yourself. Please speak to someone to assist you and please be safe:)"

ptsd,fp1fb50,t3_gamn0c,1588233587.0,"I think living in an apartment with children is totally unreasonable. There’s no way kids can live without causing complete destruction, landlords of apartments and units or even town houses have a duty of care. Even if you don’t have sensitivity issues you still have the right to peace and quiet. Sorry it’s so bad. I live in a house and my kids give me constant panic attacks I would be so much worse if I knew it affected others as well"

CPTSD,fott3mc,t3_g9feeu,1588065154.0,Maybe it’s so Esper of disorder that he can’t agree with anyone when they first say something. It’s a debate thing in his brain. Maybe it’s not just females maybe it’s everyone. Or maybe he has been raised that females are a lower species and can’t be right but he doesn’t feel that way it’s just engrained in him till he finds the courage to fight it.

Maybe sometimes it takes someone a couple of minutes to process what you’ve said, but it didn’t sound mean. If someone shows me their baby and I don’t thinks it’s cute I m very blunt, sometimes this comes across as hurtful. No I don’t think your baby is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen but it’s your baby so that’s all that matters. What you think. End of"

It does not matter about anything else it does not matter about tweens that think they’re funny or cool. Couple of years and reality will kick in for them. They don’t matter as much as they think they do. What they say “no body cares” it will be ok. You are ok be kind to yourself"
