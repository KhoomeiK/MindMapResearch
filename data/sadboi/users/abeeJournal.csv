Like last night I had to go to the store and someone stole my motor scooter.and I saw someone being stabbed across the street so I ran out the store with my groceries. And when I tried to call the police I realized I had just stolen so I got quiet. And they kept asking was i there. So I said “oh I have seizures from time to time. Bye” and I thought I was being followed so I ditched my phone and hid nearby until I was able to wake up🙄🙄. Idk if I’d say a nightmare but I was so happy to realize it was a dream
