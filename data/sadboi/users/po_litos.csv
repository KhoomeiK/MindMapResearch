The cops (pacos qls) said they were putting on Mentholatum to avoid being affected by the Tear gas they throw at us (which was obviously disproven by [scientists ](https://www.theclinic.cl/2019/11/18/bioquimicos-chilenos-desmienten-a-carabineros-mentholatum-no-alivia-e-incluso-empeora-efecto-de-lacrimogenas/))"

Yes I meant to write receive, but as my PC has spelling check for both English and Spanish it didn't correct me, as «recibe» in an actual word in Spanish. And also, yes, I wanted to write summary instead of resume, I'll edit this. But I'm glad the message was understandable nonetheless"
gamedesign,f6vaucf,t1_f6utn9f,1573181118.0,"Is this an honest question? If so, Chile (my country, which is a spanish speaking country, so I apologize if I mess up grammar) is going through a major revolution because of the inequality of living conditions. Minimum wage (as the game shows) does not cover the day to day expenses, this gets even worse when you retire, because you receive but a fraction of what you were paid, about $100,000 CLP or $134.30 US Dollars. Almost everything is privatized, health, education, natural resources, etc. You are basically forced to be in debt for most of your life. This is a very short summary but I hope it helps you understand.

Edit: Grammatical errors. Also yesterday  ""president"" Sebastián Piñera announced laws that antagonize protesters, give more power to military and police forces against civilians (while protecting police forces), an especial intelligence investigation team and a rise in aerial vigilance. We are being oppressed, latest report by the human rights institute said there are 5 homicide complaints, 19 sexual violence complaints and  168 complaints for other kinds of torture, this is against military and police forces. There are 5012 people imprisoned (of which 549 are boys, girls and teenagers). There are 1778 peopled wounded in hospitals: 41 for bullet shots, 519 for buckshot shots, 338 for unidentified firearms, 35 for pellet shots, and 177 people report eye wounds, some of which have lost sight of one eye."

Adam needs to make Jonas ***try*** to prevent his father's death in order for Jonas to ""understand"" his place, remember that Adam knows everything that Jonas will live."
