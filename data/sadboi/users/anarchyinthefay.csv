My mom died two years ago.. it’s weird to say that considering that it feels shorter. Feels like sometimes it happened yesterday. My mom was placed in hospice, so I had anticipatory grief. I knew her life would end in a month or less. I had prepared myself. Six months after she died, it hit me like a train in the middle of work. I had to quit due to depression, but after dealing with it head on, the grief gets easier. 

You’ll always miss your mom. My whole yard has become a display of solar lights of butterflies since she loved those. There will be days where it’s there and days where you’ll miss her but smile at the memories.  I use to tell myself I know my mom isn’t suffering, I just suffer missing her.
