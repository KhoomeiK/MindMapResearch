Then after I found out what trans was I completely rejected it and desisted (was already calling myself guy names/ wearing men’s clothing/ telling people I was a guy). I had a “base” and I didn’t even stand on it. I just hid away from it which caused some serious psychological problems. Everyone is so different with all different lives.

Being exposed to the worst fucks with you. You’re such a compassionate person to even share this and for what you did to help by reporting those accounts.

AskReddit,fpc3ti4,t3_gcl9q2,1588486699.0,"Very long sorry:

I didn’t realize how anything was wrong until I was 9 and started puberty because I was never really thinking about it that hard. However, as early as 4 I remember looking to and relating with the adult men in my life and wanting to be like them and I would like learn how to person from them because that’s what felt right for me. 

These actions aren’t inherently gendered but I have a couple examples: 

I watched my moms bf spit on the ground and I would try to do it too. I also would value his input in telling me about things about life and wanted to act like him. Another time I was in the car with my father and I decided I was gonna sit with my legs open because in my tiny brain all guys do that and I felt weird that I didn’t do it but my father told me not to. When I asked why he said it was because girls don’t do that. This instance really frustrated me and I don’t remember exactly the thoughts I had but they were 100% in the realm of “but I’m not a girl”. 

As a child I didn’t pay attention to my body but I was uncomfortable 24/7, didn’t want to wear dresses, extremely uncomfortable with being gendered in Spanish (grandmother). I would often play pretend by myself as a male character in my brain. 

By 9 when I started puberty after fully expecting to start a male puberty because I was already in denial out of confusion and lack of proper communication skills. I was pretty traumatized but when puberty started I was like yeah there’s something wrong. Although I didn’t fully understand that I was trans until I was 12 because I found out what trans was and even then I thought I couldn’t be trans because I’m FTM and thought it didn’t work that way.

Wave 3 of realization was last October when I finally snapped out of this intense denial and my brain puzzle pieces fell into place. I literally experienced a severe drop in instances of psychosis and gained some emotional regulation. Good stuff. 🤙🏻

Tl;dr : as early as 4 but I didn’t understand anything was really wrong, 9 when I started puberty, 12 when I found out what trans was, and 21 when I realized it was transition or I wanted to die (transition was a last option for me. Thought about it a lot in my teens during my years of deepest denial)."

I occasionally longingly thought of using the men’s bathroom outside the auditorium but opted not to because I was worried about who would see me if anyone just happened to use it (something I worried about in the women’s bathroom as well but in that case I would feel unsafe rather than uncomfortable). However, of the 2 years I used that unpopulated bathroom I encountered a person a total of 3 times. There were bathrooms outside of the lunchroom too and at certain times in the day they won’t be populated."
