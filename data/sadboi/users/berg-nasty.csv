houseplants,f71swc0,t1_f71ng29,1573347420.0,Thank you! Haha she's my favorite ðŸ¥°
houseplants,f71sv6d,t1_f71s428,1573347398.0,Honestly she hasn't been too bad for me. Healthy splash of water every couple days. She's been on a pebble tray and I mist her daily. She's to the left of a south-facing window and away from a vent. So far so good!
Anxiety,euocwim,t3_ch08i6,1563940151.0,Yes except that 'a little while' to me is just the weekend. I've been struggling with this for quite a while now. I know Monday is going to be relatively the same as Friday was but I can't shake the feeling that every Monday is just going to be the worst day I've ever had.
Anxiety,etvyz45,t3_cdeova,1563248561.0,Needed this. Today was incredibly difficult for me. Saving this for later

plants,eqgaqe5,t1_eqfvg2o,1560033789.0,Not OP but wait until it's ready to be watered(wrinkly leaves). I found that not as many leaves will fall off if it's a little dehydrated. When I repotted mine I put the pot on it's side and wiggled it off. Definitely lost leaves but the fallout was very minimal.
houseplants,eqeuy60,t3_by8ths,1560010115.0,Beautiful. Added to my list

cactus,epnaxxq,t3_bvaj7h,1559324468.0,How often should I be watering the saguaro and agave?
succulents,epk3eck,t1_eian8dh,1559266720.0,"I'm a little late here, but I just got a smaller saguaro and was wondering what kind of soil would be best? Would like 40% cactus soil and 60% perlite work or is there something that might be better for him?"
