I feel like the show really hits its stride about a third to half way through season 2. The mystique of the world, the political intrigue, the choreography of the fights, it all just gets ramped up substantially in season 2.

Additionally, I think another huge advantage Avatar had was just how unique it was when compared to its peers. There wasn't anything that so much as resembled ATLA between Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network at the time (except some of the shows on Toonami, maybe)."

People looking to join the military should desire to protect their country, work with a diverse portfolio of people from a multitude of backgrounds, and face the challenges that unfamiliar environments bring.

Your argument is actually self-defeating. Why should the military adjust policy and spend money to appease such a minuscule group?

Basically, I'm saying that there are different avenues to moral righteousness. In the example with the island, you consenting to me killing you absolves that act of moral wrong. In the case of legal punishment, the fact that those carrying out the punishment do so because a crime was committed absolves their act of moral wrong.

Why *shouldn't* that right be possible to take away from you for something you've done? Should these things truly be a human right that one is entitled to for simply being born? After some light research, I found that the average annual cost of living for a United States inmate is $35,000-$60,000.

Limiting one’s freedoms, while different from some forms of punishment, is nonetheless punishment. As is killing them in the light of more heinous crimes.

I agree that our current prison system is a far-cry from rehabilitation, but what do you believe should be done if someone simply cannot be rehabilitated?

Feeling down this week /= depression. No longer finding enjoyment in anything in one’s life or being unable to maintain basic hygiene? That’s more like it."
halo,f8vw0fh,t1_f8vv45m,1574878371.0,"Yeah, I honestly hadn’t even considered it. I’ve dusted off my OG Xbox and ran through CE’s campaign a few times over the years, but I guess I haven’t had the true experience in well over 13 years..."
halo,f8vuw8p,t1_f8vu5eo,1574877741.0,"I really had no clue, haha. I guess a newer tv would need to downscale the image pretty heavily, which would probably make everything blurrier. I don’t even want to know what CE’s native res was..."
halo,f8vtv9y,t3_e23gr8,1574877166.0,"Totally irrelevant in the grand scheme of the post, but why do you “need” to play CE on mammoth CRT TVs? There are plenty of semi-modern LCD TVs with AV inputs."
amiugly,f8o1099,t1_f8o05v7,1574658785.0,"Hmmmmm, well the shape of your face is fine, but it looks somewhat short clean-shaven, imo. I've got a bit of a bias for full-beards, to be fair.

Something like this would look pretty dope:  [http://motivational-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/how-to-grow-a-full-beard.jpg](http://motivational-tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/how-to-grow-a-full-beard.jpg)"
amiugly,f8nwl3t,t3_e1adcx,1574654857.0,"Honestly there’s nothing about you that screams “ugly” to me. You are kinda plain, though. Can you grow facial hair? I think you’d look better with a beard."
halo,f8cawhz,t1_f8c3r3l,1574456411.0,"Yeah! People are always circle-jerking the Library, but it's just foreplay for Two Betrayals, honestly. You know what? Scrap that. The floodified versions of earlier levels can all die in a fire. Keyes was far worse than Truth and Reconciliation."
halo,f8bfzys,t1_f8bfdj3,1574435983.0,"Gotta respectfully disagree. CE doesn’t really become difficult until Guilty Spark-onwards. Two Betrayals is probably the most frustrating mission.

2 is just on another level, though. I’ve had jackals headshot me with bank shots around corners on Metropolis, FFS. The vehicle portion of Uprising is equally obnoxious. Most people just use the level glitch to skip over it."
halo,f8b4hdr,t1_f8b29jm,1574426603.0,"Yeah that’s nuts. Halo 2 has some of the most ridiculous sections of any Halo. Gravemind alone is harder than 3 and 4, imo. That fucking throne room."
unpopularopinion,f85ubfs,t3_dyri8l,1574283332.0,This is the most beautiful thing I've read on this sub in quite some time. Just yesterday I emerged from the musty box of an office I work in to get slapped in the face with a thick cloud of blueberry lemonade-scented vape. Next time this happens I'll be sure to celebrate my residential bi-pedal air freshener!
depression,f7obssb,t3_dx2la6,1573924766.0,"Look at the bright side: at least you can still write a coherent sentence. I relate completely, though.

It’s actually funny in a cruel sort of way, since people have noted that I’m supposedly a much more enjoyable person to talk to since I’m a “great listener.” In reality, my mind is too slow to keep up with the flow of the conversation and devise a response, so I just sit there slack-jawed..."
amiugly,f7mugyd,t3_dwwh0g,1573874094.0,"You posted on here about a year ago, didn't you? You've got a very memorable face."
unpopularopinion,f7isrlr,t1_f7irrgz,1573764958.0,Oh god. Sarcasm is really all in the delivery. It's difficult for my sleep-deprived brain to tell from text alone sometimes.
unpopularopinion,f7ip4lb,t1_f7hxqpg,1573763240.0,"Just playing devil's advocate here, but telling someone that ""no one is ever going to respect you, you don't deserve it"" sounds an awful lot like tearing them down to me. There's something to take away from every opinion, even a somewhat sheltered and narrow-minded one like OP's."
unpopularopinion,f7efx0r,t1_f7eeluq,1573656559.0,"I honestly think it’s an evolutionary holdout from when infant survival rates were considerably lower. With the advent of modern medicine it seems pretty pointless to me, though."
unpopularopinion,f7eeg79,t1_f7edy3m,1573655483.0,"Ah, ok. I pretty much feel the same way, then. It’s the parents who simply have kids because they feel that it’s their biological duty, then proceed to neglect their child while simultaneously parading them about as their personal mini-me that piss me off."
unpopularopinion,f7edpd7,t1_f7ebwnv,1573654916.0,"People give birth because perpetuating the human race is a base biological function, yeah. I just think the entire “they HAVE to be my own flesh and blood” is a bit ridiculous.

If I were to be lovingly raised and cared for by a non-biological guardian, and my actual father/mother was a terrible, negligent parent, would I be obligated to love them simply because we’re related “by blood”?"
