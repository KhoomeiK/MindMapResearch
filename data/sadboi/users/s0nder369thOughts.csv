The only thing I can bond with them over is arts, and the Internet ( well half of it), I cant even comprehend half of the vocabulary they use now haha =P"
TrueCrimeYoutube,fqwmluz,t3_gkq0xb,1589710078.0,"My heart aches for her.. there is hardly anything that feels as suffocating, confusing, and heart wrenching as being accused of doing or saying something that you never did.. because for people like Shauna, people who are honest and giving, hardworking, and make it point to treat others with kindness, Cant even imagine themselves doing something like that.  So when accusations arise, its like stepping into another dimension, mind and body separation. Its a curdling scream forming deep down in the gut trying to get out and defend itself, immediate panic mode..

And that is why Shauna is my fucking hero right now.. because if that was me.. 80k + subscribers from around the world, 80k people who now think Ive swindled and deceived them. 80k people who think im a cheater, a liar, a thief.. I would  not be able to come back as quickly and on point as she just did... Not to mention spending 16 minuets telling my side of the story, I would struggle greatly to be brave enough to do that or focus on the light long enough to defend myself in a timely manner.. And Shauna was not only Brave, she was a MF CHAMP for defending herself with such poise AND class, while simultaneously trembling and choking back tears

&#x200B;

Shauna not only runs a YT channel, She cares for members of her family, she is a college student, and I believe she also had/has a job on top of all of that ( cant remember if she still does) . She doesnt just run a YT channel, Shauna runs a True Crime vlog, she presents some of the most  comprehensive and meticulous research in the True Crime community, she articulates beautifully, and she reaches her mind into every aspect of the stories.. No Stone Left Un-turned.

&#x200B;

I listen to a lot of Crime podcasts and vlogs on a daily basis, and there is one thing that I have noticed about True Crime researchers, they are not just reporting, they have this deep rooted desire( and the skills to show for it) to help solve Cold Cases, missing persons, murder or sexual assault victims. Not only by telling the stories of those people, but also teaching themselves and teaching all of us. This gives all of us the capacity to be able to help, different perspectives, changed logic and reasoning, even things to look out for to help defend and protect ourselves and our loved ones, 

&#x200B;

Shauna Rae if you ever read this, im sad that you took all of your videos down but me and thousands of other people still have your back and support you 100%, you never stopped being hero... but I believe that this very terrible experience has just morphed you into your next Superhero phase we all got to see it and for me it was so powerful watching you open your heart to the internet. Thank You  for all that you have done, will do in the future, and thank you for being an outstanding role model.  

TLDR;

Shauna Ray is doing a public service, and she is doing a damn good job at it. People need to slow down before they go after someone for something they dont even know the entire story of. Treat others how you want to be treated, Would you rather people attack and abuse you before they know what is going on, or be  seen and treated as ""innocent until proven guilty without a doubt""?     Everyone should give everyone a chance to defend themselves before they burn someone at the fucking stake."

""Scientists"" like Neil completely destroy what it means to be a Scientist, or at least what I was taught about what it means to be a Scientist. 

The politics within the ""cliques"" of Science Academia and their entire peer review and citation system makes me really sad for everyone on earth.

Which is funny because that is exactly what I thought after going through this stuff yesterday. 

I dont know how exactly Wix works or what their privacy terms are, but I thought it was weird that both audio files ( on the catacombs page and main page), and all of the photos and thumbnails are all Wix files. They are labeled like they are straight out of Wix inventory. 

But I mean, maybe Wix protects personal file data by converting it to a wix file, im not sure exactly how that works for companies like Wix.

I would have to find another site that uses wix before, I would be able to tell differences in the source code. Im new-ish at source code reading, so I also could be missing some rather complicated stuff, but so far it really seems like a Wix advertisement. 

Especially because every musician has the same songs listed on their ""Albums"" and they are hella generic, like elevator music. And any of the FB, Insta, and Twitt, links all take you to Wixs social media. There is also user option guides like ""Click Edit to write a caption here to tell them more about this artist"" or whatever it says.

And and I also found that they use alot of ""4s"" on their website, specifically I found the number 4444 ( 44 is a masonic symbol and a big deal in the new testament).

So I went on kind of a tangent.. The page was called ""Catacombs"" which could be a reference to ""Lazarus"" in the bible, and John which is the 4th book in the bible talks about Lazarus in chapter 11.. and John 11 vs 44 is: ""The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and let him go""

Which could be significant considering it is talking about ""Grave Clothes"" and this is a culture website for Art, Music and Clothing. 

The only other numbers that I have seen anywhere on their website are

I once witnessed a girl in the 4th grade i think, get hit by a car at my bus stop when i was in Elementary school.. But this wasnt the fucked up part. 

The girl was barley knicked in the shoulder by the car who was not speeding. She didnt even fall down, she just stood there and then cried when some of the bus stop moms were checking her. 

When we were leaving school, the local news was there interviewing her on the front lawn and I witnessed her saying that the car hit her and she rolled under the car and it ran over her back. 

Which was SOOO far beyond what happened, I feel really bad for that older gentleman who was driving the car."

I stated at the VERY beginning of this post that this is MY opinion. 

I never said that all of this is fact, I dont actually know if there are even ET's, I never seen one, not one alien has come down here and told me all of that. Never once did I say that I KNOW any of this is true. I did use however, multiple fucking times: ""I think"" and ""I believe"" as my verb's. 

You dont get to judge me about the way that express my thoughts. I do not cater to you, its my mind and my thoughts and my opinions.

You have no idea who I am, you have no idea if I closed minded. You have no idea what my background is, my hobbies, what I value spending my time doing, the mistakes ive made, the progress I have made in my life, what my favorite color is.. You dont know.. NO ONE deserves to be attacked for having an opinion and sharing it. I value knowledge and learning, and value striking up conversation.. especially when I feel like I am in a safe space to do so with like minded individuals. 

So no ""dude"", it is you who is making people like us who believe in the stuff, look bad. You hurt my fucking feelings and you likely dont give a shit. It took me a long time to even feel comfortable being social, let alone share my thoughts and ideas with other's. Its people like you who make people like me feel to nervous and judged to get on platforms like this. 

Your accusing me of doing something that I didnt do and never said. Its like you think I came up with what I said over night or something. You have no room to judge me, I cant stop you from being a jerk and you can badger me for caring at all what you think, but its not just about me.. especially not on topics like this. No one should be bullied for the way they articulate their thoughts, for the opinions they have, or for the way we think. 

  I do apologize to you if I hurt your feelings, because that was never my intention to do so. I came here to share some of my own thoughts and that was it. I didnt come here to make anyone look bad, I did not come here to make anyone feel like their viewpoints suck or don't matter.. Im here because I value this community, and I am not sorry for calling you out on that shit. Check yourself before you decide to say something shitty to someone you dont know."

AlternativeHistory,fmh0otv,t1_fmdvlec,1586063102.0,"Exactly! What else is there? ( let me talk your ear off for a few if I may- tried to space it out so it doesnt seem like word vomit- not sure it worked acutally)


If we look at the Universe and all of life as a one singular unit and take out the anthropomorphic version of a creator and look at this ""Singular unit"" as starting out like a basic life form, we can see a basic ""reason"" behind that.


I use the word ""reason"" lightly because I do not want to give the Singularity an anthropomorphic quality like ""intention"".


We live in a fractal Universe, which is most likely a small part of a larger fractal multiverse and so on, we constantly keep discovering that smaller parts of life imitate larger parts of life.



For example the recent study they did mapping out Slime Mold's growth patterns which they created an algorithm out of to try and map out the Cosmic web and they have found some corroborating evidence that the map that came out of it might actually be our best approximation of what the cosmic web might actually look like, considering it lines up well with the math previously done on the structure of the cosmic web. 



Not only does the structure of slime mold and the cosmic web construct itself similarly, but so does the neural network within the Human brain.

 

With all of the evidence out there, it seems highly plausible that Everything within our Universe is a direct reflection of itself.



And what did life go through to get where it is today? It evolved then devolved and repeated. It adapted to varying conditions, it pushed the stronger life forward and rooted out the weak. Life on earth began as nothing conscious, simple forms adapting and evolving to the environment and the conditions it was subjected too, and the longer it lasted the more experience and kind of ""Memory"" it gained, eventually becoming something with a brain and the ability to use more senses to observe its surroundings, and then became something that had the ability to observe and comprehend itself. 




But it gets so much bigger then just that, like where do we go from here? Where is the point at with the Singularity has evolved to the point of having no other path left other then to devolve and go again?



In my opinion, that happens when the Singularity has become something that has the ability to observe and comprehend itself, in all of its glory, all of time, all of matter, every part of itself. When every piece of information  that can ever exist is seen and comprehended all at once.




 That moment that the Universe is finally able to act like one singular unit because the realization that it IS, what it is, what it has done, what it is apart of, what purpose it served, and the fact that it served any purpose at all, happens at the exact same moment,  and it will happen again, and again, imitating and growing its larger and far older ""Multiversal singularity "", (made that word up, pardon me).




 And who could ever know or comprehend how far the extension is of the fractal we are within, how many branches there are, how many slightly different game plays are happening of each of those branches in parallel universes. 




We can forget that we are not only apart of a Multiverse in such a ""basic"" sense, we are also apart of a Multiverse with several different cycles, processes, and networks; dimensions and planes of existence within and out side of it, doors to spaces where all information is known, comprehended and even relayed to spaces and beings that do not reside within those planes. Spaces that might not even be subjected to an evolutionary cycle of death and rebirth. 




When you take away the natural instinct we have to give our selves a God with Super human characteristics, we are left with a ""God"" who has more primitive characteristics, a slightly more advanced life form who is not yet fully conscious, wandering space time, experiencing and growing itself, unable to realize or see the full picture because the picture is so vast. 




Our Universe or ""God"" is a direct reflection of man kind right now, not as we see ourselves, but as we truly are. We see ourselves as advanced, compared to our primitive ancestors, but when we compare ourselves to our full potential.. something that we cannot know or possibly ever comprehend as we are now, biologically speaking, WE are primitive and we are not yet fully conscious. 




Everything will evolve and devolve again and again until the strongest form remains, it will die and it will be reborn again and again until it  has exhausted every possibility of its existence.. and who could say what happens at that point? 
A supreme being? Maybe that is how cosmic beings come into existence that are met within places like the DMT realm. Maybe that is how the designer of our Multiversal fractal came into existence. 




Sorry for talking your ear off, Im not offended if you didnt even get to the end of this. Sometimes I get thinking and even at times learn new things at the same time I am explaining a concept or idea to someone. I have often actually completed theories that I was at a dead end with simply by talking about them, so I can type novels and I apologize.

I would have to agree with this Steve Taylor guy, im not sure I have heard of him. 

I would even go as far as saying that this whole ""Rise and Fall"" of enlightenment has happened several times over in a cyclical manner. Do I have evidence to support this... no, I dont either. Nothing very tangible. I have about as much evidence of that as the Bible and world has for the existence of Jesus.

I am glad you asked about the Maddona Autotune... This is actually the song that made me make this post in the first place. 
Madonna- Batuka
https://youtu.be/nU2eApGw_TU

A lot of people liked it, and maybe it is because I grew up on late 80's- 90s Madonna and because I am a vocalist, but I lost Musical and Vocal respect for her after ""Bitch Im Madonna"" came out, I respect her as an Artist for her ability to translate her ideas and imagination into reality, she is very eccentric and appreciate that she has no fear to do so.. So in the last decade her music has gotten ""trashy"" , and she has largely lost the ability to hold a note.

  I have recently happened upon her whole ""Feud"" with Lady Gaga, and other artists and the whole story behind ""Bitch Im Madonna"", then realized after watching several interviews with her and members of her family, that I really had no idea who she is, and Madonna is a fat headed bitch.. maybe another reason why I really fucking hated this song she did. 

Dunno why so many people liked it, then again im not sure why so many people like many things."

unpopularopinion,fliknla,t1_fkq194x,1585184560.0,"Some of them do, but they do it not to mask the singers terrible voice, but the voice is used as a ""sound"" or ""instrument"". 
Some voices in EDM music are not even human at all, they are a product of the controllers. 

The way EDM works is a lot different then the way the pop music industry works. A pop artist is a brand that is owned by a company, and they will do just about anything to rack in the cash. That persons brand is built around their voice and their image. 

EDM doesnt work like this. There are very, very few EDM artists who are singers, or ""Bands"". The majority of EDM artists are producers who only make music. Vocalists are searched for in a rather large library of people who sell their voices to producers pieces of music. A lot of Producers dont have the time, or need to auto correct or auto tune a vocalists voice if it isnt great when they could just pick again from the pool of hundreds of other vocalists. 

My issue with Autotune is not the program itself, but the reasons for using the program. EDM is Electronic music, Autotune has a place within this genre because the music is electronic and largely created by computer programs and artists. 

To use Autotune on Madonna's voice is horrible. It doesnt sound good, it doesnt fit in with the rest of the music's composition, and because she cant actually sing anymore... we can guess with a 90% certainty that she uses it because she cannot hold a note anymore. 
It sickens me, because it is used within pop music to correct a singers voice which launches them into a place within history where they dont deserve to be compared to all of the other great singers out there who CAN sing, have talent, and do not need any sort of synthetic vocal correcting."

I have to tell you that YES people do methadone recreationally, people sell their scripts of methadone. People sell all kinds of scripts, Anti-depressants, anti anxiety, pain killers, sleep meds, even blood pressure meds.    

I dated a heroin addict a long time ago, and I came over to his house one day and his friend had his head in the toilet while being 90% incoherent because he was trying to get high off of a Suboxone someone gave them due to them being out of heroin cash. Ive seen the same thing with people using methadone, and even  blood pressure medication which blows my mind.

All things which are probably extremely unsatisfying, but people justify things in their own way. 


Dealers make runs to places like mexico, where you can go to a drug store and buy these medications without a script. Their are chemists on the dark web who make these medications and sell them to anyone. Their are people who trade their scripts for different scripts or a bag of marijuana or a dirty deed.  

People do dumb shit, people huff paint and gasoline, people smoke synthetic marijuana that is basically just wood chips doused in rat poison, weed killer, and other chemicals that a normal person would never dream of in jesting.. in fact this synthetic ""Weed"" was packaged and sold in smoked shops as ""potpourri"" for over a decade before the Government cracked down on it, and what did people do when it was gone?
