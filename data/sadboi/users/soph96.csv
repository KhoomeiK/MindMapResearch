AskWomen,ergzf7l,t3_c1z8cg,1560862949.0,"About a month and a half after our first date (we didn't know each other at all prior to the first date). I told him I loved him too, but looking back it was way too early to be saying that. We definitely rushed things and I think that's part of why our relationship didn't work out/last that long."

depression,erg07us,t3_c1ug9l,1560822718.0,I started struggling with depression when I hit puberty (so around 12-13 ish) so I haven't really been truly happy since childhood. I feel like I don't even know the real me so I just constantly miss being a kid.
AskWomen,erct43z,t1_ercson2,1560721240.0,I needed this. Thank you.
AskWomen,erct2ei,t1_ercdlx5,1560721205.0,This 100%. Or at least don't rush exclusivity/boyfriend and girlfriend labels. Made this mistake with my ex.
introvert,eqkq5gz,t3_byheyo,1560128736.0,I feel the same way...my mom tells me I'm just running from my problems but honestly she just doesn't get it. Sometimes I also wish I could just stop time so that I can have some calm days to myself without worrying about maintaining any relationships.
introvert,eqh8wx0,t3_byf8sf,1560052038.0,I've had this exact same issue all year...coming home didn't even feel like home. It got to the point where I'd work late just to avoid going home -- my office is usually cleared out by 6 pm so I could have some quiet time if I stayed late. I'm moving into a studio apartment in a few days -- I live in Chicago and luckily studios are pretty cheap compared to other big cities. Sorry you're dealing with this :(
