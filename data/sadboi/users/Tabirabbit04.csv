WritingPrompts,fcuebft,t3_eiqhvz,1577978929.0,"""The quality of thought process servers these days!"" you think to yourself as you roll over and attempt to sleep for the billionth time tonight.

   It's a rare quiet night in the bayou, the cicadas chirping softly and the faint croak of the alligators coming from the swamp. The damp heat has your t-shirt clinging uncomfortably to your skin. Your thoughts center on your current investigation. 

     Being a telekinetic with psychic ancestors can be a fruitful venture but exhausting. Three weeks ago you received a gut-wrenching voicemail from grieving parents in California begging you to look for their missing teenager. Most places a seventeen year old boy goes missing, local authorities assume he ran off with a girl or drugs. Maybe ran off partying with some buddies. No signs of foul play, no reason to be suspicious, but as soon as you heard that mothers voice images play through your mind forging a connection that is not quite wanted but just as real as every memory you have experienced in your own body. You now have a mission. 

Find Tom Spartan. 

""BHAM!"" A textbook flies across the room and every light in the house slams on lighting up the lone cottage on the Louisiana bayou. 

""Fuck it Jim, I'm up now round up the family. Its time to get to business."" you say brusquely. 

""Yes mam! Sorry Aura!"" Jim says, as a small, disheveled looking apparition of a man appears in the corner. He takes a harmonica out of his back pocket and plays 3 notes as the spirits of the Fenley family gather around her and they set their third eyes open looking for Tom Spartan."
