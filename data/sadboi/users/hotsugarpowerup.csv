bipolar,ffrxgpo,t3_euqddj,1580168099.0,"I can certainly relate to ""those great ideas"". I still get a kick when I meet someone who will listen to me and my ideas. I even got a newspaper to run a two page story on one of my business ideas that was all BS. I really feel I know what you mean about embarrassment with that.

I don't know if there is a way to properly control ourselves from doing things that are stupid. I suppose taking medications as directed and seeing a mental health provider of some sort is probably a good place to start."
bipolar,ffrvgeh,t3_euw3u6,1580166751.0,Just wait until your whole life is ruined by one single mood cycle. You can lose your job while they refuse to let you leave the psych ward. Your significant other leaves you and takes everything you ever worked for. Then you lose your healthcare and have medical bills you won't be able to pay in the rest of your life. No one with Bipolar is immune to complete ruin. I once thought I had it pretty easy for someone with Bipolar also. Life can be pretty cruel.

bipolar,ffdu382,t3_et2frg,1579828953.0,"I just walked out of the Disability Services Office on my campus a few hours ago. This was hard for me to do since, for the most part, I am doing fine. After talking with my therapist, I decided the time to discuss accommodations is while I am still doing fine. I did some reading and thinking and realized that having the documents and such in order before any psychotic break down would better protect me in the event of a course failure.  The crash and burn after a manic episode doesn't really go well with the teachers grade book. I'm hoping this way will work for me better than the past.

I hope you do well in your studies. It seems that oftentimes our disability can get in the way of what we want in life. Good for you on recognizing when to throttle back so that you can achieve your goals. It certainly isn't always easy."

Veterans,f2ao4lg,t3_dc58jx,1570115732.0,I was on terminal leave and told they had miscalculated my terminal leave. I had been at my civilian job for over a month. They told me I had to come back (over 1200 miles). I told them they could fuck off. I received a direct deposit for half a day of leave a few weeks later. Your mileage may vary.

I have a few other service connected disabilities that were not considered. The counselor essentially told me that my average of one mental health hospitalization a year and my need for intensive mental health support would interfere with my ability to obtain full time employment or education. My physical disabilities prevent my from any job that isn't sedentary . Since I have only small limitations at home, I was denied for any of the home assistance. My normal VA mental health doctor said she doesn't recommend I work at this time because of some high dosages of my medication to battle off the crazy."
bipolar,f0kf4q6,t3_d58nzs,1568678108.0,Best I have come up with is locking my debit cards in my safe. Keep a small amount of cash for small daily transactions. If I am leaving town I grab my credit/debit card for gas and stuff. Forget all payments on Google. Avoid websites that may tempt you. Find something better to do than online shopping. This has made things easier for me.

Entrepreneur,f063zxi,t3_d3y0es,1568428430.0,"I looked into it earlier this year. For a brick and mortar store, you will have to charge a lot over what you are paying for your inventory. Be prepared for people saying that they can either buy it on Amazon cheaper or your quality for the price sucks. The overhead of a retail location in a non-sketchy area is going to be expensive. When you find a nice place you are going to be up against the zoning police and the not in my backyard crowd.

Online, you will either be one with Amazon and sell through them or you will be on your own. Through Amazon you must be an established seller through them with a good record. They won't let just anyone show up with a truck full of sex toys. There is a lot of competition sourcing from China and many factories willing to produce your product are very willing to sell your design to competitors or they can even start selling your stuff without you. If you plan to sell them online through your own site you will face a lot trust issues from customers and have to really market your brand.

Tldr: It possible but there are a lot of obstacle to success."
bipolar,f02j7rn,t3_d3fl0p,1568332044.0,"I have no magic button, but I can share with you how I was able to better manage my symptoms.

1. Open myself up to getting better. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get better by what I wanted to do. I had to commit myself to the treatment game. If I wasn't able to communicate with a therapist, I would look at something like a self help book for Bipolar Disorder that might help out. Watch YouTube channels such as Dr Tracey Marks or Polar Warriors on Bipolar Disorder.

2. Download an app for tracking your mood.
I use Daylio. There are others out there. This will require being honest with one's self about how they are really feeling.

3. Try my best at healthy sleeping habits.
I am on medications for this. It took honestly with my mental health team to get to this place. Through trial and error we did it. Now they are starting to not work as good as they use to, but I was at my Dr this morning and we are working on this again. Our condition requires constant maintenance.

4. Eat healthy and get in some excersize.

By managing Bipolar as a whole, we can reduce all symptoms including irritability and agitation. By commiting to getting better, and using the resources available to us, we can be a lot more enjoyable to be around."
bipolar,f02h1lw,t3_d3eabj,1568330605.0,"Hey there. Thank you for sharing your experience.  I have been hospitalized 5 times, the first time being 10 years ago this week. I can tell you in my experiences in 5 different States, that your experience is not uncommon. Unfortunately, I would say that your experience is about what you can expect. A couple of my experiences in military hospitals were the most positive. Mostly very severe PTSD patients and a very understanding staff. The civilian wards I have been to had nurses that at best were just punching the clock, and at worst, seemed hell bent on making your time as miserable as possible. Most recently, while on a manic episode, I spent some time with a gentleman who was in his 70's that had a lot of problems with reality. He told me he was doing meth a few weeks before coming in. He was blind and the nurse told him he couldn't have them write down his grandson's phone number from his phone. He had to write it down himself. Too bad he is legally blind. He was there 4 days before his grandson was notified of where he was. 

I hope this helps"

If you have the time, I recommend you read up on it, or as I did, watch some videos on YouTube. There are some specific to mental health care on there. If I would have know better, I would have watched these while I was still employed. I hope this helps you."

From Health Line, here is a list of the symptom from severe toxicity:

heightened reflexes, seizures, agitation, slurred speech, kidney failure, rapid heartbeat, hyperthermia, uncontrollable eye movements, low blood pressure, confusion, coma, delirium, death.

bipolar,ezilgmd,t3_d17mep,1567929115.0,"It is typical for people with many conditions to experience drastic changes in how they feel and view someone, especially as young adults who are typically getting a feel for how they fit into the world.

With Bipolar Disorder, it can be a struggle to cope with a world that has a hard time understanding the condition because it is affects mood and emotions and can not be directly seen. The struggle also applies to intimate relationships

Unfortunately, the non physicalness is the same department as where our intimate relationships are developed, in our brains. With that said, a relationship with someone with Bipolar has a high likeliness of being more challenging than average. 

tldr: Anyone can change how they feel about a relationship. Bipolar Disorder can cause challenges in intimate relationships and may require extra effort to maintain"

BipolarReddit,ezcagwc,t3_d0rngv,1567832220.0,"You most certainly can hope to have a meaningful relationship with Bipolar Disorder. For me, in my experience, a really important thing to do to have a great relationship is to be up front and honest about symptoms that can impact a relationship.

In my current relationship I told my s/o early on that she may think I am a great person now, but when I get depressed I can be a horrible person. I told her about my severe irritability and we even discussed the symptoms of mania. I told her about the very high likeliness of hospitalizations.

I probably mentioned all of these things because these had all been reasons for failed relationships in past. Before and after I found out I have Bipolar Disorder. I think I was tired of wasting my life hiding who I am.

Finally, I credit a great mental health team that works well with me and my partner. If I didn't give a daily effort to maintaining my mental health, I don't think I would have the relationship I have today.

tldr: Good relationships are possible, but it takes effort."
BipolarReddit,ezba8d0,t3_d0oyu7,1567816600.0,"Hi,

It is very interesting to me that you mention your obsession with Kurt Cobain. I had a very extreme obsession with Kurt Cobain. I was living in the Seattle area when the news of his death became known. It was during that same time my uncle died at a very young age. I could relate to the sadness of a young man dying at such a young age. When I was in high school I got really into the music of Nirvana. I was dealing with my first break up and the book *Heavier Than Heaven* had just come out.  I felt with that book a deep spiritual connection. This was also my first struggle with major depression. It was from this that I became familiar with Lithium as a medication. Many people focus a lot on the song lithium, but many of his other songs mention traditional medications such as Pennyroyal Tea. I would spend days listening to his songs and reading the lyrics trying to make sense of it all.

Looking back, it seems that these songs may have been written to people with bipolar disorder. It is certainly debatable whether or not Kurt Cobain had Bipolar Disorder, but there is no doubt he had an understanding of the disorder."
BipolarReddit,ez8733u,t3_d02yfa,1567735777.0,"Hello,

This summer was my first significant effort at exercising in a long time. All that I did was walk around the neighborhood at first. I started enjoying this quite a bit so I started exploring around my city. I discovered walking trails and neighborhoods that I had never seen before. The sunlight and exercise were good for my mood and I lost a significant amount of weight. I ended up going at it too hard and stirred up an old foot injury. Custom orthodics are on their way and I will be able to get back to it. I highly recommend simple walking if you want to get started moving around. Also, it is fun to do."
