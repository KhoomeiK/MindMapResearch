I have a partner, who also has significant MH, who I feel like has left me to ride this coster alone. 

In this mess I focus as much as possible to help them focus through their work day and to power through our terrible family life at home with a child who has severe MH who abuses everyone in the home.  Then I cook meals, do household duties, clean, all of it.

I feel pretty shrugged off to my partners current struggles and household worries. As I crawl in my skin, over looking up serotonin syndrome jacking up my anxiety. I tried to vocalize my struggle, made it clear through text that I'm struggling with my meds. And just blah. This just kind of fucking sucks. I feel alone. Probably selfishly. But like I give and listen all day, just to feel like I should sit in this alone. 

Its great, I love my life.

People just need to learn to not be afraid of mental health and push their friends to seek help outside of ""oh it'll be alright, give it some time."" 

I advocate therapy to everyone who is struggling. Big or small struggles. Just because you might need therapy to work through something doesnt mean you go every week, month, or even year. Most of the time its a couple of sessions working through whatever is messing with you. Not to mention, learning new, healthy coping mechanisms."
