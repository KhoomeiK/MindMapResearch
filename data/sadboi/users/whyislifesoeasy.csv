CPTSD,f4ua91e,t3_dlmbuq,1571803460.0,Hey I have this too!  It's not exciting to see another person with the same problem but it is kind of relieving to know its not just me.  I think its neurological damage as a result of early trauma and developmental disruption.  My trauma basically started on day 0 and my mental and physical development are both severely stunted.  I'm a middle aged toddler in a lot of ways.  The only thing that I've found that consistently provides relief without any major setbacks other than cost is MMJ.  I'm currently doing my own personal therapy on this and its a mountain of poo.  I don't have any real solid advice other than stay away from dangerous self-soothing/medicating as this kind of nervous system problem is pretty exhausting.  Breathing exercises are the best free relief I've found if you can't afford medication.

dating_advice,ersgex1,t3_c3ncx4,1561213264.0,This is the craziest removal of responsibility.  In other words: women shouldn't bother doing any of those things because the only thing she really needs is a pushover that she doesn't have to work for.  That's exactly what she's saying.  Guys do actually like a nice good pretty girl who has sex with them while raising their children lovingly.  Why don't you want to do that?
