StarWars,fbiz0s1,t3_ednti7,1576919932.0,I found Kylo lying to her about her parents was ok. Agree with your second change. What really needed changed was having Luke not be as much of a defeatist. Have him question if Rey is worth training while not drinking the titty milk like he was and then have the training process happen in a more optimistic way. It may still be the weakest of the ST but it would be better than what we got.

Also with him being into theatre/acting since he was a kid, knowing then that he wanted to do it for a living, and still acts to this day with the vast amount of roles, and not having an ego problem or anything like that, he is one of those actors that truly has complete passion. Obviously he has standards of what he’ll accept, but the fact that he took that role in Dragonslayer leading him to acquiring the role of Palpatine, just goes to show, if you accept something in something you have passion for, it can lead to wonderful things."

StarWars,fbhbs38,t3_ed67vc,1576869934.0,"After seeing a late night screening last night, I can honestly say that I am still highly excited from what I watched. Easily found it to be the best of the Sequel Trilogy. It even somewhat lightened my thoughts on Last Jedi, and even somewhat the Prequel Trilogy. I know it sounds like sarcasm, but I honestly thought it was that great with how it tied up everything. Also, if the rumor that George helped with the film then that redeems him for the prequels (but not the Special Editions. STILL WAITING ON A FOLLOW UP FROM THAT SCREENING OF ANH UNALTERED). I became teary eyed with the scene between Han and Ben, and I found Rey making her own path at the end with continuing the Skywalker legacy, viewing them as the family she never had to be heartwarming. But the most teary eyed and heartwarming scene was CHEWEY FINALLY GETTING HIS MEDAL! <3 Plus seeing Lando again was great. Billy Dee Williams never lost his touch.

Ranking the Skywalker saga, I would list them in order from best to worst: ESB, ANH, TROS, ROTJ, TFA, ROTS, TLJ, TPM, AOTC
I’ll probably change my mind in the future but I’m sure after seeing Rise in theaters again that I’l still love it as much."
