He began testing me emotionally at first eith cheating to see how i would react but i forgave him and then began woth food amd stuff to see how long until i got sick,

I am still baffled, the person i knew i never really knew at all.

He is a psychopath and he gives ASPD sufferers a bad name.

He knew i was vunerable due to my mental and psysical illnesses, he became my carer but was torturing me at the same time and i was un aware of any of this.

He rescued me from an abusive situation and then put me into a new one, that his how he works."
