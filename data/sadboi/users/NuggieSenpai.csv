ChronicPain,fnkw2xp,t3_g2cxbz,1587041445.0,"Hey friend, I feel your struggle. When I was around 13 I developed endo which turned into chronic pain and nerve pain as well. I'm 22 now. I dont have any answers for you, but I am here if you want to talk about it. I think the best advice I can give is to seek therapy if youre not already. I see a counciller for something else but we also talk about my pain and how that affects my life. Because chronic pain really does affect your mental health. The lady I saw helped me to define what I want out of interactions and what kind of values I want to keep and how to go about interacting with people in a way that keeps my values. So if you do see one I would recommend talking to them about this as it will help you to avoid holding it all in and ending up blowing up at people in anger. All the best for you, I sincerely hope things start looking up. You're already doing something great by reaching out for help"

I dont know if anyone has told you but ultrasounds are super not accurate. Like the MAY find something but even if they dont you can still have stuff. The only way they can really tell is to have a skilled surgeon who KNOWS and is experienced with endo to do a laparoscopy. Nancy's nook has a list of surgeons you could try see as they actually have been trained and educated about the disease. I also recommend seeing another doctor about your pain. I also (sorry holy shit I'm just blasting out everything I've tried) recommend seeing a pelvic pain physiotherapist and they can help with your pelvic floor, which tenses up and tightens from the pain. It can help with some of your pain. I'm also trying a tens machine at the moment through a physio and I'm gonna probably buy one. It's not a drug thank God and it is a small machine that has electrodes and sends small electrical currents to the muscles. Worth a try maybe?

My first surgery they found lesions that they couldnt tell if they were endo or not so they sent a biopsy away and apparently they arent. This was from a low socioeconomic town

Then I had another surgery at the main city in my country but both are public health. I had to push hard for elective surgery. They said I dont have endo. Its heartbreaking. At least if there was a diagnosis we could do something about it, have some closure? How are we in todays society with our technology and are unable to even get a diagnosis other than chronic pain or a central nervous system sensitization? I know I'm in pain, I want to know why!"
