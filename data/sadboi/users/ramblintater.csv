I am quick to hate or write off those that don't like me or constsntly show they like me.

It's destructive but safe. My friend says, ""you can find happiness in not having any expectations of anyone and accepting things for what they are.""
 
Now that is something I need to obsessively ruminate on..."
BPD,fdwi7lm,t3_emyry4,1578758887.0,"I'm so happy you made it here now!  I wanted to die two days ago. Emotions are so fleeting.

Now I realize I will not let anyone get in my way from taking care of me, even myself! Life is a battle and struggle daily but you've gotta have your own back!

Be your best own friend, not your own worst enemy. 

Love to you. It's always darkest before the dawn."

BPD,f7ep4bc,t3_dvktk3,1573662705.0,"Yes fear used to be my only drive, mindset way of thinking socially or in a relationship.  

I did not realize this until my now boyfriend helped me through and out of many toxic thought patterns and showed me the possibility and actual reality of living in the positive love based mindset as opposed to a negative fear based mindset. 

It takes so much practice to pin it down and turn it around. 

My whole thing was ""I'm ignoring my instincts""

Well some of my supposed ""instincts"" were really just a bunch of fear based decisions and they had gotten me into such a shitty life I decided to differentiate between them and actual instincts finally and try this positive way of thinking.

It has gotten me into LOA (law of attraction) and other light working practices and studies so when I'm feeling obsessive toward research or anything like that I direct it toward those positive outlets.

Fear is negative, limiting, self perpetuating and unhealthy.

Love is positive, unlimiting, self perpetuating and healthy.

They are opposite. Practice the latter and things will slowly and surely begin to change for you! 

I had to really practice to control my thoughts, stop them, spin them right side up and see from the total opposite perspective. It's been interesting and very helpful. Love to you!"
BPD,f41rfdq,t3_dizqsv,1571322926.0,"I isolated for several years, about 7, I tri d to cut off every person I knew. It was very damaging for me because I somehow met someone and fell in love but my previous isolation paralyzed me when I met their family and friends and of course after my panic attacks during our social interactions I'd ruminate and think the worst and picture them all judging me and it caused some damage. It has taken two years to get back to a normal state of confidence and interactions. I am outgrowing codependency and the negative self talk, the fear and the need to control everything and serve every person around me. Codependency is a bitch. 

I think it really comes down to feeding the positive and shutting down the negative. Trying to live in a state of love and not fear.

Fear is negative.
Don't feed it. 
Have faith in positivity.
That's my mantra and it's working each day one breath at a time."

BPD,ex9nlm5,t3_croceq,1566091590.0,"Turn the negative into positive. I think negative all day. My bf is the most positive person ever. He helps me kinda rewire my brain to think positive and thinks that will be the biggest help but then I feel like I'm being brainwashed..then I think nah maybe I'm being unbrainwashed, see how that's works haha. And I see how his positivity pays off and gets him through things that would send me back into my turtle shell.

I still have my moments but taking my mind into the positive helps a lot. If I am beginning to assume stuff and panic I try assuming positive not assuming negative and it calms me down.  It's a lot of work being this anxious and confused. 

I have been experimenting with those YouTube videos of different hz, like wipe out all negative energy 417hz and there's a whole bunch more. One was for accessing the pineal gland or something and after listening to that I felt so good and happy and light, like my brain was free from borderline, so ultimately idk idk as well but these things might help."
