Either way... you are again, two completely separate individuals. 

I strategize and meal prep and make sure I‚Äôm eating a colorful and balanced meal yet I‚Äôm still overweight, while my roommate is extremely unhealthy in my opinion and has the ideal body type. We‚Äôve lived together for a year and she has literally never used the stove. She skips breakfast all together and only eats frozen lasagnas, bean and cheese tacos, take out, or chips. Her side of the fridge is purely condiments and alcohol. She also never works out and parties several times a week. It‚Äôs baffling to me how she is able to survive... but we are two completely different people with different needs. Just continue doing what you‚Äôre doing and remember that what works for one person isn‚Äôt always best for another.

solotravel,fchetcb,t3_eh7usw,1577649827.0,"Sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way.. but I vote for KEEP GOING!!!  You have a LONG way to go and you never know, things may get better in a couple days. The key to everything is to appear confident, even if you aren‚Äôt. Act confident when talking to your hostel, be stern and persistent and threaten to leave a bad review and who knows maybe they will move you to a new room. If not, then just suck up the loss of $300 and stay somewhere that makes you feel comfortable. It‚Äôs a good chunk of change but you‚Äôll be glad you took charge. If you absolutely have no extra money to afford that, then ask your family! If they want you to stay so badly I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be willing to help if they knew your situation. As far as navigating goes, set your destination and wear headphones so you can listen to Siri while she directs you. It‚Äôll appear as though you‚Äôre listening to music and know exactly where you‚Äôre headed and if you keep your head up and don‚Äôt look around like a lost puppy, you‚Äôll blend right in with the locals on their way to work/home.  If you ever get lost, sit at a bus stop and take a second to breath and figure out where you are. Also going into luxury hotels to ask directions might be a good idea. They‚Äôll have a concierge that speaks multiple languages and is likely happy to help. 
Some mentioned going to a market and buying food there, that‚Äôs a good idea! You can go back to your dorm or even eat in a park. Something I did when traveling was I would look up the first place I would eat the moment I woke up. Once I was at the restaurant/coffee shop, I would do research and plan the rest of my meals for the day. It‚Äôll keep you busy while dining alone and make you look like you have something important to do. And if you aren‚Äôt already... post on social media as often as you can! People will comment on your stuff and it‚Äôll keep you company! Lastly, I second the person that said scream at the top of your lungs if you get assaulted. Or go buy a whistle. Even if you continue another 3 weeks and still decide you would like to go home early, then at least you gave it another chance! Don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel bad and also don‚Äôt be afraid to be selfish. Good luck!!"

Anxiety,fc16zm2,t3_efhpkr,1577310050.0,"I originally wanted to spend the day alone but I let my sister and aunt guilt trip me into hanging out with them. 30 min into it, my sister and I get into a major fight (typical) and I turn around and go home. I feel really bad knowing all my family wants is for my sister and I to get along but I just can‚Äôt be around her, it‚Äôs impossible to be fake and pretend I‚Äôm having a good time. I feel much better being at home watching tv and might go for a walk later"
RedditLaqueristas,fbzqik8,t3_ef76dv,1577256486.0,Wow!!! Such skill
depression,fbzghau,t3_ef4960,1577245890.0,"I totally relate. The last few days people have been asking if I‚Äôm looking forward to the holidays and what I have planned and I‚Äôm like... ehh I don‚Äôt really give a shit it‚Äôs just another day. I have a very small family and we don‚Äôt do much anyway so I kind of wanted to stay home and just enjoy a day off to myself, but I feel obligated to attend Christmas."
nofriends,fbzg74j,t3_ef9wi5,1577245623.0,Love the positivity! Have a merry Christmas!
AmItheAsshole,fbzfsxp,t3_ef49r2,1577245251.0,Your sister is a dumb hypocrite bitch like my sister lmao. NTA
depression,fbx6dqq,t3_eemrfz,1577171324.0,Just skip the holiday! I very well may do the same. Family is stressful and I‚Äôm still recovering from thanksgiving
AmItheAsshole,fbx64tw,t3_eekx4o,1577171003.0,"soft YTA because it definitely could have been worded better. I‚Äôm an overnight nanny for infants and most of the time the parents form a terrible sleep schedule for their child but then expect me to get them on a routine and refuse to make changes. I can make suggestions but I have to be very careful about how I say things. In the end if they want their child going to bed at 11pm or later and sleeping all day then there‚Äôs not much I can do about it. I would have started the text message showing support and commenting on the rude landlord then making a light after comment like ‚Äúwow how does the baby have this much energy soooo late lol‚Äù 
Honestly though the whole subtweeting thing is extremely immature and passive aggressive and if she‚Äôs willing to cut you out of her life without even a discussion then I‚Äôd question if this friendship was really all that great to begin with. From experience, the part that hurts the most is not being the one to end it."
AmItheAsshole,fbx4nsu,t3_eeosdx,1577169198.0,NTA. My family always forgets I‚Äôm allergic to eggs and continue to wake me up with a plate of scrambled eggs in the morning. I‚Äôve tried to guilt trip them into remembering but nope it‚Äôs brand new information to them every single time
depression,fbvw83o,t3_eeikn5,1577136977.0,"As an overnight infant nanny I can agree that newborn babies suck! Their cries are irritating and nothing you do can get them to shut the hell up!! Sometimes I feel like I hate the baby and that I should consider another career... but in the end I love babies. They are sweet and adorable and the love they have for you is pure and unconditional. Any time I find myself angry at the baby with dark thoughts it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm sleep deprived. Being a parent and not sleeping can seriously mess you up, and your existing depression doesn‚Äôt help. I agree with what others are saying about seeking therapy if you haven‚Äôt already, perhaps taking a voluntary hold somewhere, and just working on yourself before making any permanent decisions. You may think suicide is the only feasible option but imagine finding out your dad killed himself because he regretted having you and couldn‚Äôt see any other way out. Abandoning your family is damaging too but it also gives you the option to come back and be in their life later on. Good luck, I hope things get better soon!"
Phobia,fbv40h1,t1_fbv3mm4,1577125056.0,"The thing that really bugs me is that when you google the phobia it shows pictures of the thing! Have some empathy please, lol!! Thank you though I feel better already knowing that I‚Äôm not alone nor a crazy person"
Phobia,fbv2o8q,t1_fbuzvht,1577124416.0,"Wow we are sister souls lol, you said everything I am feeling. My friend also tries to tell me it‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù because they‚Äôre tree roaches looking for water. I‚Äôm like... so!!?! A roach is a roach it doesn‚Äôt matter where they live!! I used to see them at work almost daily and sometimes they were in pairs. If my boss hadn‚Äôt hired a professional to treat the place I swear I would have quit. I hope it gets better for us!!!"
offmychest,fbuw80s,t3_eeekzt,1577121351.0,"Don‚Äôt let this bring you down, yes it‚Äôs heartbreaking but you made a genuine connection and impact. Remember that literally everyone on the planet is suffering in one form or another. You sound like a beautiful person with lots of love to give, so just continue being open and maybe look into the big brother program if helping children is what you need!"
lonely,fbtincw,t1_fbthpuj,1577080261.0,"Nope. I rarely see people I‚Äôm attracted to online, and when I do get a match they don‚Äôt talk to me. It‚Äôs pointless"
depression,faimjoz,t3_e96vk9,1576111476.0,"Yeah it‚Äôs rough!! I sleep until 2/3pm as well and the whole 6ish hours that I am awake, I can‚Äôt wait to get back to bed. I‚Äôm always so fatigued with a headache and no amount of sleep is ever enough. Showering helps but it also can be difficult to even get up and do that. Hope you find some motivation soon."
