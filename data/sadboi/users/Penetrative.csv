Drinking is a good general example; I have a little family that I love & am very dedicated to...but im not a Stepford wife, I enjoy being social and hanging out with my friends, I like to drink and loosen up a bit sometimes.

What i've learned...it happens with maturity, when your priorities become reliant on you.  I would normally think, career, family, parenthood would trigger the ""I know better"" mentality.

unpopularopinion,fpt25yy,t3_gfe8ha,1588883559.0,"You are operating under the assumption that the wife is not loving, compassionate or considerate....

When I hear the ""Happy wife, happy life"" line I think of my grandparents.  My grandpa doted on my grandma, he ensured she was happy.  He often took her purse to carry it for her, drove her to the casino everyday and sat beside her as she gambled.  Whatever she desired he wanted to make it happen.  But my grandmother did not require it, she is not bossy or demanding.  He just wanted to do things for her and she was happy to let him.  He was equally happy, because he loved her, its how he wanted it.  She was also sweet to him, neither of them really ever denied eachother anything, they both wanted to make eachother happy.

Its just more obvious when the men are seen out in public...grandpa carrying a purse and massaging grandma's shoulders at the slot machine makes it really apparent...What is less apparent is in the home, the one grandma kept spotless all by herself, the three home cooked meals she made, he always got to pick what they watched on TV and it was always Cowboys football.

I remember when I was little with my cousins & we were visiting, there was a dessert on a plate wrapped in saran wrap, we had no reason to think ti was anything but leftover free for whoever.  So we took it & ate it and my grandma had a fit.  ""That was your Poppi's!  I was saving that for him!  He deserves a treat now and again and you cows ate it!""...We felt terrible...and when he came in the house and grandma was so upset and told him all about what we evil children did...He kissed her forehead and told her it was okay.  He looked at us and said, ""It was moldy anyway!  You are gonna get sick!""...

There marriage is pretty much the one I compare the rest to.  Anyways, I feel like when you think of that saying, you are assuming the wife doesn't care if the husband is happy...and thats not how its suppose to be...That saying is about acts of selflessness to contribute more love to the relationship in anyway that you can, picking your battles, letting the little things go, recognizing when something is more important to your spouse than it is to you.

Unfortunate wives tend to be known for being dramatic or caring too much about the little things.  That saying is meant to simply tell husbands to pick their battles...if husbands let the little stuff go, their wives will treat them very well in turn.  ""He let me paint the bathroom pink...of course I support him getting a motorcycle.""...That sort of thing.  Often small gestures of kindness are rewarding in large long term ways."

Advice,fpsuf44,t1_fpssic0,1588879793.0,"I never said it was not wrong...not sure why you keep trying to impress upon me her actions were wrong, I never denied that.  But judging a human in  their entirety as ""bad"" based on a few actions is not okay, I wont do it & neither should you or OP.  Which is why the girlfriend got upset.  It is very unfair to claim to know a human is bad based on a glimpse.  Obviously the girlfriend knows her friend a lot better than OP and obviously she disagrees with OP's judgement about her as a ""bad person"".  

>""However that is not the case, going by what we were given this person is absolutely a bad person.""

You seem to be missing the point, that which also gives reason as to why im relevant to this sub because of my fairness, compassion and logic- im full of opinions & obviously share them freely.  

But get this.....OP wanted advice about his girlfriend and his relationship with her, not whether or not his judgement was fair (it was obviously not).  My advice to him was good & reasonable.  I have no default position.  I have millions of opinions based on what I read, im just objective about it."
Advice,fpsrv05,t1_fps6nud,1588878557.0,"I didn't share what I thought about monogamy at all, only shared the facts of it.  My how you like to judge prematurely.  

Op did not say constantly, only that she was the ""Type to brag about...""...Type, as in- he is filling in the gaps with his imagination.  This poor girl is being judged by 3rd, 4th & 5th parties about an account she gave to her friend 2nd hand that she likely thought was confidential.  

For all we know this friend believes OP's girlfriend wants to hear juicy stories, they could all be embellished or the girlfriend wanted to entertain the boyfriend so she made the story sound juicier than it was.  Maybe the shit never even happened and she is a lying attention seeker.  We dont know, the possibilities for variables, and tone, and intended audience are enormous and make a big difference.  Especially when OP wants to declare to his girlfriend that her bestie is a bad person.    

There is absolutely nothing wrong with me, I never denied the actions as amoral.  You are jumping to conclusions and filling them in with your own judgements just as OP.   Just because I dont stamp a human as a bad person does not mean I dont think the things they have done are amoral?  I do not believe doing some bad things makes a person bad. 
 
What is wrong with you that you think you can accurately judge a human as good or bad by getting only a glimpse of their actions as told by a 3rd party?  OP doesn't know her life, he only knows what he heard and fills in the gaps with what he assumes.  This same woman absolutely could have been in open relationships, its not something people advertise.  We only aren't talking about it because the information wasn't presented.  How terrible the world would be if it was considered fair to judge a human based on limited knowledge of a situation.  

Im not wrong, my position is to not prematurely label or judge humans based on severely limited knowledge of a situation and that doing a few bad things doesn't make a person bad.  How is that wrong? 

Meanwhile there you are happily labeling a human as a ""Bad person"" after reading a single paragraphs of content."
Advice,fps5rrv,t1_fpp184e,1588867933.0,"Op did not imply constant, only that she is the ""type"" of person- then shared one story his girlfriend relayed.  If im being honest, only the most basic (im being nice using that word) of human specimens thinks if someone disagrees with them its because they are guilty of the thing they disagree about.  So im not at all surprised you think because I dont agree with you that cheating makes someone a bad person you'd draw the conclusion that im a cheater.  

When in reality im simply not an idiot, its absurd to call a cheater a bad person for acting on biological impulses.  Monogamy is a made up idealist rule pushed upon people.  Its a nice idea, and romantic and a noble goal, but it is not natural for humans.  So its not shocking when they fail at living up to the monogamous standard.  I wouldn't call a person ""bad"" for breaking any number of man made laws...and thats all monogamy is, a man made relationship law.

 Although society cherishes monogamy, the expectation of exclusive sexual activity is unsustainable for most couples....

> ....Estimates today find married men cheating at rates between 25 percent and 72 percent. Given that many people are loath to admit that they cheat, research on cheating may underestimate its prevalence. But it appears that cheating is as common as fidelity

Thats *married* people; people bound by contract to practice monogamy unless otherwise arranged.  This girl in question isn't even married to anyone, shes cheated on boyfriends.  Hardly a crime I consider worthy of being stamped a ""bad person"".  

Humans are fallible, and even if the friend has not realized the gravity of her choices and how they make her sound, fucking a consenting adult in a car, and cheating on boyfriends doesn't make her a bad person.    

I only hope your crimes are not judged as harshly as you judge the crimes of others.  If im being honest I dont believe that statement would hit you as hard as it should because I doubt you are able to objectively see your own moral transgressions."

Advice,fpoxm8k,t3_geoys4,1588792410.0,"Generally probono vet work is done out of the goodness of their heart & the animal goes back to the rightful owner or if it was abandoned then the vet may adopt it or it would be placed in a shelter.  

If the vet knew that your girlfriend left the animal to be put down, and he wanted to adopt the cat and pay for the procedure himself, I dont understand why would he then ask your girlfriend's permission?  I feel that would unnecessarily complicate things.  

If I was the vet, id just let the person think the animal was put down and go about what I wanted to do.  If it were my cat id be like, ""If you want to pay for the procedure, a million thanks, but you can't have my cat afterward...Shes my cat, ill pay you back or we could split it or you can work for cost, lets work something out."".

Its like, if you leave your vehicle at the junk yard, you assume its going to end up in the crusher, but people can salvage things at junk yard and keep them.

Also, no one will die if they dont eat or drink for a day.  Im speaking of how motherhood is more of an expectation for women & we are also expected to eat & drink in a day.  No one expects anyone to specifically go for a walk, thats far less expected than eating or drinking.

Of course motherhood has the possibility to be someones top #1 goal, you are an example of that.  Your post is about your annoyance with people that think your goal of motherhood isn't enough.  Im simply explaining it to you.  People expect women to be mothers, on top of everything else.  So that is why people you tell this to dont think its enough.  They consider it to go without saying, they expect it as they expect it of most all other women.

Im not saying its right of them, I think its fine for you to be a mom, for all women *if* they want kids.  But considering it is a biological expectation and literally any woman with healthy fertility systems can become one naturally.  (Obviously even women that are re-productively challenged can also have children in more complicated difficult ways-achievement unlocked.)

So when people inquire about life goals, and paths, and aspirations, ambitions and for your response to be that you just want to have kids...Thats great, nothing wrong with that at all, its natural...but its also natural for people to be like, ""Ok,what else?""."

These people that ask about ""what else"" other than motherhood you want for yourself, I dont believe they are devaluing motherhood or saying something else is more valuable.  I think they are speaking of what I mentioned earlier, how motherhood is more of an expectation, very nearly goes without saying.

Its like if someone was to ask what your plans for the day were and you said, ""I think ill eat some food & drink some water"", they'd be like, ""Well duh."" and your response is, ""Well thats the extent of my goals""...They are not saying food & water are less valuable than other things a person plans to do in a day, because we'd all die without it- but its to be expected.

~~During the COVID lockdown I was struggling to survive and maintain a quality of life and made the poor decision to operate a motorcycle I had procured by less than legitimate means.~~    ***I stole a bike to keep for myself...***

~~The bike has no keys and I had wired the ignition together to create a keyless entry.

Now I’m facing charges for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. I stayed in jail for over a week in isolation due to the COVID epidemic. The Experience was uncanny and convinced me that jail is not the place for me.
