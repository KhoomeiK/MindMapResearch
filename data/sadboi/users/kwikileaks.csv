MR. TRUMP: Yes.

MR. FUTERFAS: I object to the form of the question. I'll permit my client to answer it, but I think there's a characterization of the email. So in any event, we can proceed, but I just want to note that.

MR. SCHIFF: It's what the email explicitly says.

Interview Transcript of Donald Trump, Jr. (December 6, 2017)

Page 12

MR. SCHIFF: Did they communicate by email?

MR. TRUMP: My father doesn't generally use email, so I don't -- I don't think so.

Page 15

MR. SCHIFF: How did you decide which version of the email to release publicly?

MR. TRUMP: I just released the one that I had.

MR. SCHIFF: And who did you consult in that decision?

MR. TRUMP: Counsel. MR. SCHIFF: Did you discuss it with anyone other than counsel?

MR. TRUMP: Not anyone other than in privileged conversations.

MR. SCHIFF: Now, Mr. Trump, apart from counsel, there are no privileged conversations.

MR. TRUMP: Correct. So it would've been with counsel. So the answer is no.

MR. SCHIFF: So the decision to release the emails publicly you never discussed with your father?

MR. TRUMP: Not without counsel.

MR. SCHIFF: Not without counsel present?

MR. TRUMP: Correct.

MR. SCHIFF: So you did discuss this with your father with counsel present?

MR. TRUMP: Yes.

Page 19

MR. SCHIFF: When Mr. Goldstone represented that the Agalarovs had information, official documents that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia that would be very useful to your father, what was your understanding of what you were being offered?

MR. TRUMP: I didn't know what I was being offered. I know what Rob wrote, but, again, I had no way to validate any of that.

MR. SCHIFF: Mr. Goldstone wrote that this was part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump, helped along by Aras and Emin. Did you understand what he meant by that?

MR. TRUMP: No, because I was not aware of any support from Russia.

MR. SCHIFF: You replied less than 20 minutes later saying, ""If that's what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer."" Why were you willing to accept help that was part of Russia and its government's support for your father?

Page 22

MR. TRUMP: He was the head of the campaign. He knew more about this stuff than I did. So I asked him to sit in on it, as I would with a lot of meetings throughout the course, if they were available.

MR. SCHIFF: He knew more about what stuff?

MR. TRUMP: Campaign procedures and what we could or couldn't do. So I would have brought him in on any meeting.

MR. SCHIFF: Was there a question in your mind about whether you could or could not accept help from the Russian Government?

MR. TRUMP: I don't know that I thought about it.

Page 35 (Context from page 27/to 34 is interesting to note he implies he knew nothing about the matter of the meeting, but still found it important enough to invite Manafort and Kushner)

MR. GOWDY: Right. How much of the time was spent discussing that, and how much of the time was spent discussing dirt on Secretary Clinton?

MR. TRUMP: Again, the majority was really split up between -- really started off as Russian adoption, which was sort of the, you know, what I perceive to be sort of the feel-good segue to probably lobbying for something as it related to that Act. So, you know, I'd say we spent less than, you know, 5 minutes of the 20 minutes, again, speaking through a translator about the quote/unquote ""dirt,""

Page 56

MR. SCHIFF: Well, you said, when you responded to my colleague's questions, that it wasn't that useful. If you had known this was the derogatory information that she had on Secretary Clinton, would you have taken the meeting to begin with?

MR. TRUMP: I don't know.

MR. SCHIFF: Well, you said it was essentially a bait-and-switch and a waste of time, did you not?

MR. TRUMP: I did.

MR. SCHIFF: Does that indicate that if you knew that in advance, you would have not taken the meeting?

MR. TRUMP: If I would have known that, I perhaps would have heard them out, but I don't know.

MR. SCHIFF: But it's fair to say that you were hoping for something more useful than what you got?

MR. TRUMP: That's fair.

MR. SCHIFF: And is it fair to say you wouldn't have invited the campaign chairman to the meeting if all you knew you were going to get was what they provided in terms of derogatory information?

MR. TRUMP: In hindsight, that's probably accurate, but I don't know.

MR. SCHIFF: And in hindsight, you wouldn't have invited Mr. Kushner if you weren't going to get anything more useful than that?

MR. TRUMP: I may not have. I don't know.

Page 59

MR. SCHIFF: But you may have asked Ms. Veselnitskaya about whether she had any dirt on the Clintons, vis-à-vis, the Clinton Foundation?

MR. TRUMP: I may have asked if that's what she was talking about as it related to donations, but I don't know. I don't know specifically, and I don't recall.

Page 74

MR. SCHIFF: Once you did discuss the emails with your father, what took place -- I'm not going to ask you about what you asked your attorney or what your attorney told you, but what did you tell your father about the emails?

MR. FUTERFAS: That's a -- we're going to assert privilege there, please.

MR. SCHIFF: There's no privilege between Mr. Trump, Jr. and his father.

(they try to ask the question gain but:)

MR. FUTERFAS: Yes, we understand the question. Thank you, but at this time, I'm going to have to request that my client not answer. There are -- we believe there are valid privilege invocations given that there were counsel, both on his side of the conversation and on his father's side of the conversation who were present for that conversation, and certainly, we want to count -- get counsel from and speak to his father's counsel to understand their position. They may feel similarly or not.

Page 78

MR. SCHIFF: Were you involved at all in helping your father prepare for the speech that he was previewing about the very, very interesting information on the Clintons?

MR. TRUMP: I was not.

MR. SCHIFF: Did you ever ask your father what he meant by the very informative and very, very interesting information on Clinton?

MR. TRUMP: I did not.

MR. SCHIFF: Rob Goldstone's June 3 email to you said that Emin Agalarov had ""asked me to contact you with something very interesting."" Was this the very interesting information that your father was referring to?

MR. TRUMP: I have no idea.

MR. SCHIFF: So you have no idea whether it was ever communicated to your father that the Russian Government, via Aras Agalarov, was offering very interesting information on Clinton?

MR. TRUMP: I know that I don't recall ever giving it to him. I don't recall bringing it to anyone else.
