Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm 25 now. I was late on the Scrubs train. But it was one of the best rides I've ever been on. Such relatable characters. It was one of the first tv shows I watched(about 13 years old at the time) and Ted was one of if not the first character I saw that had to deal with depression. 

I myself was and still struggle with it. It's a daily battle. But Ted showed me that it was capable to not only function while having those feelings but to also find joy in helping others. And personal joy too. Little things like a band or getting back at a crappy boss a bit. Just enough to get you through for a while.

Ted literally contemplated suicide on the show. But he kept going and eventually he met someone who loved him despite what he believed of himself. Ted. Kept. Going. He might be a part of why I keep going as well. Through this crazy mess that seems so goddamn hopeless there's got to be something at the end of it. We won't realize it till we find it.

So once again thank you. I really am going to miss you. Take care.

P.S. to you readers PLEASE don't let me anywhere near the episode My Last Words. I might flood the apartment. Causing water damage to the apartment below. Which might require a lawyer.

Then she started crying. Principal came in and talked with her. They cut the lights off in the building and told us we had to be quiet but didn't tell us why.

Soon after parents came and picked me and my cousin(Pre-K) up and took us to our aunt's house. Then I saw the tv and the news and I... I...

Just went and played my Gameboy while the adults cried.

Had to complete my Pokedex.

Later that night I remember a news broadcast showing a Muslim celebration and trying to say that they caused the attack. My parents fear became mine then. Not their racism. The fear of more attacks.

We didn't live that far from Yankee Stadium. Apparently they fly planes over the stadium sometimes and one this occasion(maybe a month or less after the attacks) our building starts to shake and we hear the sounds of a plane EXTREMELY close. My mother throws me in the hallway and splashes all of her 350 pounds in top of me to protect me(or suffocate me)
