I had this conversation with my kid in my head so many times...

When you will grow older your opinion on death will become much more peaceful, old people mostly ready for it. They embraced the fact that life is gonna end someday.
Also, they have so much memories!

Of course they had bad moments. But good ones too! Like, seeing you for the first time. Watching you grow, learn to speak, smilie all the time.
That’s what I will say when he’ll ask me “daddy am I going to die?”.

Actually, my personal desire to end my life how and when I want didn’t go anywhere. It’s here, part of the personality.
But now I will wait at least, like, 20 years I think.
I can’t damage him like this too soon."

There are people who was taught to help people like us.
Your reason may be totally different but I guess may have the same solution.
Consider seeking help and stop thinking that “it’s just something wrong with me”.

SuicideWatch,fojjizd,t3_g7laqf,1587822581.0,"Suicidal thoughts are a part of my life for like... 15 years? Last few months especially, dunno why. It was very hard to accept, but what I’ve learned:
1. Therapy. It works. You may need to try few specialists before finding your own tho. The thought that brought me there - I can’t repair cars = I need help = I go to mechanic. Same with my mental state. I accepted that I need help.
2. In my, not your(!) case it’s permanent. I’ll be what I am forever but I can adjust the level of depression.
3. Meds works. Forget about this zombie shit, be smarter that that. There are several generations of antidepressants already. But like in the 1. - U may need to try different ones so u find what works for You. (See therapist for prescription).
4. Try to find side activities that distract you. Video games, meditation, movies, anything.

I have a son and a wife, I just can’t imagine what damage would’ve been dealt to them if I’d give up...
