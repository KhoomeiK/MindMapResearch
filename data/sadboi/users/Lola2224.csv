I’m 100% against abuse and abusive parents deserve the worst punishment. Again sorry if i sounded mean.

You can’t be serious. Why would it hurt anyone to talk about the importance of motherly love? That’s like saying Rowling shouldn’t write about romantic relationships because that would hurt people who can’t find a partner or that she shouldn’t write about good marriages because that would hurt people who are in an abusive relationship.

Whether you like it or not out of all the different forms of love that exist motherly love is the most unconditional. The love a mother has for her kids and the amount of sacrifice motherhood requires is stronger than any other form of love that exists. Does that mean every mother is wonderful and selfless? No, it doesn’t but usually a mother’ love is the strongest force for good. Rowling was in no way trying to convey the message that all mothers are awesome. Heck she even included the examples of Merope, Eileen Prince, Fridwulfa (Hagrid’s mother) and Walburga Black to show that some mothers are abusive or abandon their kids. But others are willing to go to the extreme to protect their child. It’s a beautiful and very realistic message and i can’t believe some decide to purposely twist it into something that it isn’t."

I don't know about other countries but in my country the only ones so far that brought attention to the fact men can get raped too were feminists. Guess who made jokes about it? Other men. There is a feminist club that encourages men specifically to join and share their stories just like women. Very few of them do though because most are afraid of being vulnerable and speak out.

Also since he was great at Occlumency and Legilimency he would have been able to read his opponents mind and know what spell they are about to use and how to deflect it. Similarly to how he did with Harry, except we know he was restraining himself with Harry.

Harry's trouble making behaviour further strenghtened Snape's idea that Harry was just like his father.

HarryPotterBooks,f4b8ehr,t3_d8l71r,1571508422.0,"Voldemort was definitely a psychopath. He showed all the traits of a psychopath. He had a superficial charm when he was younger, was a good liar and managed to manipulate everyone into thinking he was an alright guy. He had ideas of grandiosity and thought of himself as being above others. He was a good charmer though could also be impulsive (as witnessed in the orphanage scene). He clearly lacked empathy and the capacity to show remorse which is classic psychopath trait. Juvenile delinquency was also present. As he began splitting his soul he gradually began losing his humanity more and more but i think the signs were still visible. I think even Rowling called him a psychopath in one of her interviews.

Bellatrix is harder to figure out for me. She was definitely very disturbed but i never knew exactly how to categorize her. She could have been a sociopath but sometimes i thought she was too unhinged to be one (though 14 years in Azkaban could be blamed for that). She definitely lacked empathy, capacity to love and had violent tendencies but was too reckless to be called a psychopath as they are better organized. Sociopathy is clearly a possibility for her."

Mental illness and depression where not taken as seriously as they are now, most parents where blind to the signs.

We don't know whether they checked his room or not but according to Sue they did. Sending him to a counselor would probably have not helped (remember Eric was seeing one and it did no good). I'm sure if the Klebolds had any inkling of how much Dylan was suffering they would have found him help but they had no way of knowing.
