depression,fr0h724,t1_fr0go7p,1589795528.0,"Since I was 13. I’ve tried everything, and did everything independently. Tried to see doctors for my autoimmune issues, tried to talk to childine/helplines since the age of 14 about physical abuse at home. Tried police and social services when it got bad. When I was sexually assaulted I gathered the courage to tell people and report and I was ignored. I paid for some therapy out of pocket but it got too expensive. I tried to love a guy but he ended up hating me because I didn’t reciprocate at the start. I tried to reach out to him after a year but he was cruel and dismissive. I tried to throw myself into studying, but then I burnt out by the time I was 18, now I’m 20 I don’t know if I’ll graduate. 

I just feel like the life I’m living isn’t mine. It’s not the story I wanted. I’m so alone. It’s just torture. There is so much I want to do but I’ve never had anything to live for. Everyone I know has rejected me to some extent, and I am closing in on myself. I am a good friend for the most part but nothing is reciprocated. I also feel unloveable and have never experienced love. I cry most days and barely talk to anyone, let alone physical touch. I can feel myself slipping away.

What are these substances and how would I get access to them."

The type of “nice guy” girls don’t like are the ones who lack self awareness. It’s not about how ready they are to help you, or be devoted to you, or be nice or agreeableness. 

It’s actually about the guy who doesn’t have the awareness to understand that his principles and actions don’t line up. The one who thinks he’s alright as it is “not perfect” “just human” etc. If anyone had watched friends - Ross, Joey AND Chandler are “nice guys”. At various points they’re all grade A assholes who lack total awareness of how they hurt people around them. 

It’s the guy who thinks he can “fuck up” and still be a good guy - I.e. cheat, fail to apologise, harass people, not appreciate people in his life etc.

We’re just not there in society yet. Women let guys down easy, but men can be rude, mocking or worse when they turn women down.

In my opinion men struggle a lot more with knowing what they want. Men are a lot more romantic/imaginative and can really be blinded by lust. (My first thought when a man claims to like me is to give him some time so he actually has a chance to see what I’m like, not just what I look like). 

At the same time approaching women can be nerve wracking and most men won’t do it unless they’ve thought it through for a long time.

But altogether it works out. The time most men spend being nervous about asking a woman out is the time it takes for them to really think about if it’s what they want. 

And one last thing - the reason most women won’t ask out a man or approach a man is because appearance/superficial knowledge about a person simply isn’t enough for us to actually want to talk to someone new."

I’m just going off the fact that you’ve never explicitly denied it. Plus you must spend a lot of time here since you reply to posts which mention this account (untagged ), you always defend Shallon etc"
Shallontourage,fp9gvub,t1_fp7yj2n,1588425855.0,What’s “a shower liner”? What would that be?
Shallontourage,fp9gtya,t1_fp6iprm,1588425815.0,"First of all, 5 or even 10 views don’t make a difference. The info is in the post, that she mentions the reddit user u/showerliner who has been accused of being Shallon."
Shallontourage,fp9gqb5,t1_fp63mzu,1588425736.0,"That’s not the point of this post 🙄
She mentioned a reddit user on her channel, and for weeks that Reddit user has been accused of being Shallon herself"
Shallontourage,fp9gnmn,t1_fp6y82k,1588425679.0,"The point of the post wasn’t really to analyse the video, just the fact that there’s a user here who has been accused of being Shallon for a few weeks now, who she quoted in that video."
Shallontourage,fp8lgo7,t1_fp2c7vp,1588395475.0,"Even if this person was “inciting harrassers” it wouldn’t count as predatory. Predation is targeted and follows patterns. It’s also kind of indiscriminate (and therefore repeatable) but intentional. 

For what Shallon has done and all of her comments even explicitly referring to “underaged boys” “teenage boys” etc shows that she has some serious issues. The obsession with the “underaged” is really disturbing. You see, it’s not like they happen to be 18 to 25 years old, it’s that she appears to have a penchant for ANYONE between those ages.

What the commenter above is doing at most, is coming to conclusions based on very distinct events and evidence about a distinct person. That just isn’t predatory"
Shallontourage,fp8l3pw,t1_fp2lqba,1588395190.0,"Their feelings are THEIR facts, it has nothing to do with how anyone else sees it. Detaching themselves from their feelings is just procrastination in terms of working through the trauma. There’s no such thing as a false trigger. Seriously, think like that and you’ll only postpone the work you need to do on yourself"
Shallontourage,fp8kma4,t1_fp8dltf,1588394805.0,"That’s true I totally get that - I’m 20 and grown adults are already asking where my boyfriend is, as if I have to be on track for marriage and children only. But that doesn’t mean she/you(?) should be telling people marriage is a bad idea etc. First of all bc most people can smell the bs, but secondly because we don’t have to swing to the opposite extreme because of negative experiences. The most progressive thing is for women to choose when or if they want to be married, not necessarily resisting and denouncing marriage and starting a family as a whole"
Shallontourage,fp89q4y,t1_fp78o8k,1588387011.0,"Of course there’s something to bounce back from, there could be water weight, bloating, muscle loss, hormonal changes. But a person with good habits can fix that within a few months.

But tbh if you really think kids ruin a woman’s body and that scares you then you’re simply not in the right place to have a child"
