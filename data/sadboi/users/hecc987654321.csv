adderall,fp90uoz,t1_fp7ilgq,1588410002.0,"(Not OP) 

Do you have ADHD? Cause if not then up to a certain point it just has a different effect than it does in normal people. Normal people have the right amounts of dopamine, so taking medication will just leave a bunch of workers on ""standby"" in your system. But with ADHD, you never had enough dopamine to work at baseline to begin with. So your brain will put these new shift workers to work as soon as they get there. 

However, if you take more than you need you also end up having the same reaction as neurotypical people would. But with practice it gets easy to differentiats whether you don't want to do something because of laziness/depression/anxiety  and whether you don't want to because of ADHD symptomatology. Personally, my inner monologue is different between the 2 cases. If it's the former, I either feel a sense of emptiness where I can't even muster any dialogue to talk myself through the task I was doing and/or it's walking me through reasons why I should not do the thing. If it's the latter my inner monologue becomes very childish. Like ""Why bother? I have too much work to do to brush my teeth. I need to pay the penance for the years I wasted in childhood and early adulthood"" vs ""ugggggggh I don't wanna do this just kill me let's go watch YouTube videos ayyy lmao lol where's my phone?""

 If you can hone this skill down, then it gets easier to avoid seeking a euphoric effect. I take antidepressants in conjunction to help me out with this. Zoloft helps me alleviate the anxiety that I feel when I take a break - almost to a fault. Before I started to take Zoloft consistently and before I knew I had ADHD, my only motivating factor was fear and anxiety. That's why despite always doing things at the last minute, I still earnt good grades in college. Once I started taking it consistently, I found that I was no longer worried about the consequences of flunking. The good news? I became a more physically active and health conscious person. The bad news? I became even more of a pig eater and led a NEET lifestyle for years. So now I also take Wellbutrin 300mg XL to give me the ""inner drive"" that so many people hopelessly chase when they get addicted. However, I've found that inner drive is not enough. What medication does that antidepressants don't is keep me on task even when I would rather be doing something more pleasing. I search for this effect, and no more. I don't have the theoretical background to put this into accurate words, but I feel like the key is that your brain always *wants* to be in control of itself. So to put it loosely, if it's under the level of performance regarding the amount executive functioning that it would like, it won't develop a tolerance. But your brain doesn't want to be needlessly euphoric or hyperfocused. So it'll develop a tolerance to that effect of hyperconfidence and being driven by a motor. Antidepressants take weeks to set in, so they're more like new and improved valve controls for your emotional support than a sudden rush of thousands of temporary part time workers.

Lastly, I take Strattera 100mg and 0.1mg Clonidine to have at least a teensy little bit of symptomatic relief 24/7. That helps a little with, say carrying me to bed if I'm tired. Honestly though, despite being more of an official treatment I think Strattera is actually the least helpful of the mix. It's not enough to provide even basic symptomatic relief, but it doesn't help me regulate my emotions either.

How's my cardio? Fine. Tbh I was even starting to get depressed of exercise as responsibilities were piling up yet kept seeing that it did nothing to help my functioning, even if a casual Google search would tell you it is the ""silver bullet to fix Adhd you don't need meds Big PHARMA just makes you think you do lol."" So I think any negative side effects are made up for by the fact that I would be more of a sedentary, potato chip eating lardboy if I didn't take it.

As for sleep, I should mention that I  take dexedrine (100% dextro vs 75%dextro/25% levo) instead of Adderall. Honestly it still produces a decent amount of unpleasant wakefulness but less so. I'll admit that there's progress to be made here. I'm hoping to try out Desoxyn (literal meth but at least just the dextro isomer which produces less side effects and has none of the random unknown toxic junk street meth might have) eventually because I've heard it produces less insomnia in the right types of people with ADHD. I don't know why dexedrine isn't prescribed more often but I think that's just cause it's an older drug."

StopSpeeding,fp2g9iy,t1_fp1woq9,1588261240.0,"Intelligence doesn't correlate with ADHD symptomatology. It's true that on average people with ADHD and without medication score lower in IQ testing, but that's largely due to the fact that you won't make as many careless errors and impulsive answers. I myself was an A student and went to a really good university for some time. The thing is that as a kid and (to a lesser but still noteable extent) young adult, others are responsible for keeping you on task. Teachers, parents, etc. will do whatever they can to make up for your mistakes and all you have to do is prove yourself as told to do so. Adults don't get that luxury unless they already come from well to do families, have a world class talent, and/or are particularly charismatic. Adults have to make their own plans. Adults get fired for missing even a single day of work. Adults have to tend the house and pay the bills and care for others.

I'll agree that the medication is overprescribed in kids (boys in particular) given that they don't yet have enough history to do a meaningful amount of differential diagnosis, but if anything I would say that it is [underprescribed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195639/) in adults. Once you get to around the age of 25 or so, if it's still a problem then you're not growing out of it. And getting in the exercise isn't gonna get any easier as responsibilities pile up and your body ages.

 By the way, perhaps not so coincidentally it was also around the 1990s that it began to become widely accepted that ADHD was a lifelong disorder. Moreover it was also around then that the inattentive (and by extension combined) subtype became formalized. And a little known brain imaging device called ""fMRI"" came out in....1990. It's almost as if scientific knowledge could have advanced our understanding and afforded improvements in recognizing the neurobiological basis of the disorder."

Don't get me wrong, it's still possible for a person with ADHD to get a high out of the medication, but that threshold is much higher for them. Below that threshold it has more of a calming effect than a stimulating effect. Many people (myself included) report feelings of drowsiness as the medication starts to take effect.

It's only helpful while you're exercising (which is nice but not applicable to work since you can't really do anything else) and for a 2 hour time window afterwards. I would also disagree that a treadmill desk would be of any help. You can't really go to the intensity required for a meaningful amount of dopamine/norepinephrine while doing office-type work simultaneously. It makes sense if you think about it - most people with ADHD are already doing some constant form of fidgeting regardless, which is barely any different than a casual stroll. And good luck getting stuff done once you get to even just a casual jog. 

Plus Michael Phelps is a terrible example to reference. He was a professional swimmer. Why the fuck would you need ADHD meds when you're never outside of the pool? Even in his youth his talent was clear, so he's never had any reason to do more than passable work outside of the pool which plenty of people with ADHD are capeable of. OP himself was pulling B+s before medication. And in the pool, his coach was there to hound him 110% of the time.  

And keep in mind that he had an ideal support group, structure, and environment. He came from a white upper middle class family. His swimming club alone costed 30k a year. Michael Phelps basically hit the jackpot regarding the ideal ADHD body and living situation. The vast majority of other don't have the talent or money required to be carried through things people with ADHD are typically weak with like time management, housekeeping, etc.

Exercise is beneficial for a ton of reasons regardless, but it's not a viable substitute to medication for the vast majority of people. If OP wants to go that route, before he tries it out he better build a nest egg and social network big enough to act as functionally semi-retired. And don't even think about kids until you've practically built a trust fund because even functional parents have a hard time evading the ""dad bod"" lifestyle."
