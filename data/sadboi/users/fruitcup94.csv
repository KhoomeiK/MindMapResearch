ADHD,es27o3t,t1_es25q8q,1561516107.0,"the short answer: very nice classmates who were willing to do most of the reaching out, until college when a roommate helped me to become more confident in myself 

the long answer: in high school i would latch on one or two friends. i had a friend who i sat on the bus with and so by extension all of her friends tolerated me too. i was her friend all the way through elementary, middle and high school. when i moved high schools in JR year i didn’t have any friends, except for a girl who sat by me randomly once and then sat by my every day afterwards. she saw i was alone and she was the bold type who liked to make sure loners had friends too. i also would sit with someone who invited me to their table after seeing how awkward i was. the other year i was in my second high school i was mostly alone, except for someone i sat next to during first period. i awkwardly followed her to lunch one of the first days of senior year and so i’d sit with her when our lunch schedules aligned. after awhile it’d be easier to talk to them but i only had friends according to whoever was nice enough to notice i exist. even then though, i was a fake or censored version of myself. i didn’t enjoy being social but i thought that it’s what was necessary in order to blend in. however, things changed for me in college! my roommate and i obviously got to know each other pretty well after sharing a room for many months. opening up to her and being accepted and loved for who i am and especially for my adhd quirks really boosted my confidence and gave me the social experience to start to branch out. it helps that my roommate would support me in situations that i still felt uncomfortable. slowly i’ve had an easier time talking to people because i didn’t have to overthink everything. i have many friends from college now through classes and particularly social college apartment complexes. i’m at home this semester but i go to church and church activities every week with a lot of local college students and young adults ages 20-30. they’re all very nice and easy to talk to so i’m friends with many of them. i still get tired, but i enjoy being around them more than i would have in high school, and i feel more like i’m apart of the group."
ADHD,es1ozhs,t3_c5g3iu,1561502062.0,"i have social anxiety BECAUSE of my adhd. i learned at a young age that kids my age didn’t think my blurts of random talking about absolute nonsense wasn’t socially acceptable. i was afraid that kids wouldn’t like me. i do enjoy people, but social anxiety is exhausting so socializing becomes exhausting. when i’m around close friends and i’m able to be myself, and i don’t have so much social anxiety, i do find myself to enjoy it more and be less exhausted and more fulfilled by the experience. even then though, staying in with a friend beats going out any day.

adhd_anxiety,epmw96m,t3_bv6kog,1559318205.0,i’m just one person but i have illness anxiety and ADHD so this is a great question. OCD might be more likely of a comorbidity because it’s broader i would think but i wouldn’t know. i’m sure there hasn’t been more research about it either way

Anxiety,epemnia,t1_epelu53,1559184512.0,"interesting... i would have reservations calling it a service animal because there’s some gatekeeping i’ve seen about who is disabled enough to deserve one. i’ve seen videos online or dogs helping their owners with panic attacks and anxiety and other psychological issues but a few comments were saying how they were an emotional support animal because the person wasn’t disabled enough for it to be a service animal. saying things about how it’s a fake service animal or whatever. but i guess thats, by definition, what this hypothetical dog would be"

HealthAnxiety,ep0ljga,t3_btnxvd,1558977038.0,"yes 
both 
but depends on what you want. do you want to receive medication? go to a psychiatrist. do you want to have therapy in order to improve your line of thinking and improve your mental health? go to a psychologist. if you have the means for both, i’d say start with a psychologist and let them help you understand what issues you might need a psychiatrist for. a psychiatrist though, will listen to your symptoms and determine what kind of medication is right for you and you’ll work with them to find the right one. i’ve never had a psychiatrist but this is what i understand about one. you probably will only see a psychiatrist based on how often you need follow ups for your medication and how it’s working but you’ll see a psychologist weekly or so for your sessions. 

youtube has a lot of great videos on the differences and i highly recommend looking up katie morton and her videos on the differences of therapists. you might also discover some of her other videos about therapy and mental health!"
