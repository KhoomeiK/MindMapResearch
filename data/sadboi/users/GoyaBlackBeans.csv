Now what do her actions tell you?  It says that she is of poor character, and that destructive part of her nature will follow her, probably for a long time, if not the rest of her life, leaving a trail of brokenness she will regret.  She might change - but - do you want to wait that long?  Or would you rather be with a girl that is humble and sweet, pretty, intelligent, and kind?  Don't allow anyone to be reckless with your heart, and don't allow this experience to taint your view of girls.  Cheating is a cowardly act.  Most are not like this.  The reason why I say this is because I have known a few cheating men in my day - and when you scratch beneath the surface, they became that way, when they loved someone wholeheartedly, and THEY were cheated on - early in their dating life.

I had deep depression from age 6-33.  At 33, I had a choice, and chose life.  That's a LONG TIME to be depressed.  I worked on it all on my own.  No support, no confidants, no online forums, nothing.  Through pure grit, research, and trail and error.  Through job loss, and familial loss, and insane hurts and dissapointments - but I made it to the other side.  It... takes time.  Try to understand, if but a bit.

And with current world conditions, this is all going to get worse"

An incubus also tends to lay heavily on the body, and the person tends to feel suffocated.  To control through pleasure.  Who knows, maybe it's ""foreplay"".

What I mean by ""spiritually fragile"" is that from what I can gather, you are on the young-ish side (correct me if I'm wrong)...  Entities that wish to ""pester"", tend to go after the spiritually weak and oftentimes young, which is why you would bring in a priest or shaman for serious cases.  There is a reason why, they have spent years, sometimes decades fortifying themselves in spiritual warfare.  You can tell ""it"" to go kick rocks, and it works many times - but If it's persistent, there is a reason, and you might need someone with experience, and wisdom.  You ever notice you never hear of a person who follows Jesus, or Buddha, or has a strong spiritual conviction in a higher ""light"" power, don't tend to have these incidents happen to them?  Why?  Because entities don't bother, because they are steadfast to their faith.

Now of course, its all about location - but no area will be immune to the fact that 34 million people are now out of work.  I'm planning on buying a home next year.

That may not be money for some, but that's a lot of money every month, for me.  So yes, buying makes more sense than renting - especially next year.
