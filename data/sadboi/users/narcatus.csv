depression,fem4d0o,t3_epmgz5,1579239342.0,"Its really easy to slip into a depression  thinking about the environmental state of affairs. Realistically we live on a planet with finite resources, and we've found ways to utilize them to the detriment of the planet. I work as an environmentalist and I have to admit that it's sad that the environmental field even exists. 

That being said, every little bit helps. Yes there are thousands of companies and governments that don't care, but it takes a ripple to make a wave. My personal mantra is that it doesn't come in rivers, but in drops. 

Stay strong friends"

This week has been a bad week, for no reason. I think I need to find more ways to help myself out of this rut, but I dont know how. Sometimes I wonder if I'm going to sit down and accept the fact that my wife will leave me, ill move into an apartment by myself and no one will ever see me again, but the rational side of my brain tells me that this is just part of the journey, and itll get better.

1) pricing. We have a pricing department located in another province. I'm not allowed to quote myself or know my own pricing, everything comes from that team. I have no authority over my own clients. Its embarrassing. 

2) lack of support. I haven't had a sales manager for 1.5 years. The job was posted internally and no sales rep got it. It's going external. Its really fucking depressing to know that none of us are good enough. 

3) morale. I joined my company because they promised me a high base salary and 25% of my salary as a bonus if the company does well. I grew my business line by 43%, hit all my targets and got no raise or bonus, but instead they're moving me to a commission structure, which I never wanted. It fucking sucks because we all worked out asses off. 

4)  anxiety and depression. Nuff said.

depression,eqiq8qa,t3_anh7tv,1560091709.0,"I'm depressed. I'm admitting it now. 
I've suffered from Depression and anxiety for most of my life, but for some reason it's gone into overdrive these past 6 months. My wife quit her job and has been focusing on opening her own business since January, and I've been her biggest support but the sheer stress sent me into a spiral. Our sex life is gone, I cry daily in my car when I'm alone, and my job isnt going the way I'd like it to (passed over for a promotion because I'm too young, and now have corporate on my ass weekly to make sure I'm hitting targets).

I feel like garbage, like nothing I do matters, that I'm worthless. I wouldn't even be surprised if my wife left me, there's a sick part of me that thinks that she should, because she could do better. 

I'm going to the doctor tomorrow, and I'm going to work on myself. Its just hard being the only one telling yourself that you matter. I'm probably preaching to the choir though."
