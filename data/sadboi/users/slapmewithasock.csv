AskReddit,fgurx7e,t3_f0b8bf,1581128032.0,"Currently in a private, religious, catholic all-girls high school in the south. Grades average at about 40-60 kids. 

Well, girls as young as sixth graders thirsting over 60-year old fossils of old men who teach English because they have basically no other male influence in their lives. They go crazy for male attention in the high school years. 

But, also the religion teacher teaching creationism and the whole god-hates-gays deal (not a fun time to be a lesbian, lemme tell you, I am one). 

I should clarify that I essentially go to school in what is classified as a jungle, and are surrounded by wildlife and little cell phone service. We have 200+ wild and feral peacocks on campus and they shit everywhere but besides that, there was an incident some years ago where some of the elementary school kids beat one to death, which is illegal, obviously. The younger kids will sometimes catch snakes too. One time in sixth grade, we weren‚Äôt allowed in certain parts of the field because there was a python in the area with a bounty on its head. 

On another note, I swear I‚Äôve seen the ghost of a nun on several occasions. The campus I go to school on is essentially 350 years old, with a dark, damp tunnel open to students that runs under one of the main buildings (which used to be a mansion, revamped but preserved as a schoolhouse).

Edit: a couple of years ago there was a bullying case that led to a suicide attempt. Forgot about that one. It was in the grade above me at the time, it was a whole ordeal."
