Coronavirus,fkjt3vp,t1_fkjsort,1584258449.0,Ok. I sure do hope so. There should be  a blood test to check for antibodies to Covid-19. So many people are going to be in my boat. On the backside of possible/probable infection and wanting the answer as to whether or not it was Coronavirus. I canâ€™t not know.... ya know. Thanks!
Coronavirus,fkjsgpv,t3_fiio5o,1584257606.0,"Can you test to see if you have had coronavirus after recovering. I think I had it and finally now on the mend, but would really like to know if I did have it or not."

Reading through this entire thread has given me some tangible truth to help me show/explain to friends, family, and co-workers what I deal with - the BP grind. I'm going to fire off some links to the folks in my life that need to be in the know. Thanks to all. This is spot on!"
