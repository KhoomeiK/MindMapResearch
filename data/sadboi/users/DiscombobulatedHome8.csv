Anxiety,fqq9crs,t1_fpqg4bo,1589561614.0,Hi. Thanks for the reply. I just had another week and it was quite ok in video conferencing. I tried bullet points technique and also rehearsed a few times before my turn. It worked quite well but sometimes I just lose my accent and like lose the ability to find words and form sentences. It's still hard but I'm still trying everyday :)
lonely,fpnzlij,t3_ge8bb3,1588775682.0,I feel you
Minoxbeards,fnx5iw6,t1_flrlyzo,1587331885.0,You can get rid of dry skin by using skin mosturizer products. I used to get dry skin as well. It was awful until I looked it up and started applying Nivea soft 1h after minox. It works but any other skin moisturizer would work
RoastMe,fnb0qkq,t3_g0jlyp,1586807203.0,Concentrate and stop being a lil bitch
introvert,fn8sjo0,t3_fzyf2r,1586749138.0,"I don't have any friend. Don't have no one to talk to. Not even a messaging pal. Though actually I'm against messaging pals bcuz I was there trying to find the way out but it never worked out that way. We need real people who are present in our lives. Monday to Friday I'm just too busy with work, training & studying. Weekends are plenty for me. I have all the time to play Dota but none of my friends (on Steam) play that game anymore so it's just me masturbating with my hobby. Wish I had some pals to get together for a LAN weekend."

Got neglected & found his loving messages to another girl on facebook. When she confronted him, instead of acknowledging the wrong doing, he hit back ""Why did u log in to my phone without my permission?"" Left her in tears. Motherfuckers like that don't deserve a second chance. I'm afraid he'll do something like that to u too"

lonely,exl1rlc,t3_ct5sql,1566404097.0,"Girl dumped me. It's been 2 months and I still feel the hurt. She, too, was the only one I talked to as I had no friends (still have no friends). It felt like hell. I cried so much, couldn't eat anything and lost like 6 pounds. She never really wanted me anyway.

What I learned very hard is don't rely on another person for your happiness. It's like giving them the power to completely dismantle you from inside to outside. People come and go. Learn to love yourself and be happy by yourself is the only reliable way to lead a happy life."

SuicideWatch,ewqwzoz,t3_cpklw5,1565683275.0,"I'm going through the same things. At first, I decided to really make improvements and be really optimistic about the future. I was constantly improving but then just one day, when I was working and doing my own things, the trauma kicked in and since then, I have been living in the living hell again. It's too much for me to handle. Everything is so hard"

introvert,ew67kli,t3_cmylum,1565156928.0,I was in this situation before. Then I decided to spend my time on hobbies. Then I talk with people with the same interests. The conversations suddenly became so natural. U should try
introvert,ew67c2b,t1_ew5vinf,1565156666.0,So true. My gf is an extrovert and she has a lot of friends. Once I tried to sit with her and her friends. We had nothing in common and it was hard for me to pretend. So hard.
mentalhealth,ew1a0mv,t3_cm94jj,1565018731.0,"Journalling helps, speaking from my experience. Instead of venting to my friends, I vent to the paper. I let my shit out, nobody gets hurt. It's a win win situation!"

depression,ew19bmy,t3_cmas2v,1565018261.0,"I literally thought of dying again a few weeks back. Had breakdowns a few times so hard that I had to go to the restroom, during work hour, and cried my heart out. I was fantasizing dressing the nicest clothes I have and hanging myself. But I didn't. I stood up, started rebuilding my life again, enjoy myself in activities I used to love, don't think much of how bad my situation is. Now I'm here, doing pretty good. I mean, keep living so that you can have the loving moments with yourself"
depression,ew185me,t3_cm2i0a,1565017464.0,"Guess I can relate. Cuz I have no friends here. Literally zero. I mean, I talk with people at work and they're some nice bunch, gotta admit. But not that close to be a friend. And I don't have time to hang out and get wasted like people do. I used to talk to my gf, a lot, as she was the only person I trusted and considered a friend. Now she isn't around anymore. She left, because I was fucking crazy and said a lot of stupid stuff. Why did I do that? Because I thought having someone is the cure to loneliness. I was bored of living and had no future plans. I drenched myself in that stupid Dota game 40h/week and went mentally insane. After she left, I quit video games. I started focusing on my craft. I go to work, do my job, go home, continue coding. Finding that pleasure in doing what I do best again really helps because at the end of the day, I know I'm useful to myself again. It does feel lonely at times tho. But not as much as sitting on my ass all day and moan. I used to do that. Now not anymore. Fucking everything and do what you love"
depression,ew17cro,t3_cm9yy8,1565016912.0,"Yes, you can do it alone. And fuck all of them"
