But I met a lot of great role model women who told me they traveled alone to India, egypt. Just watch yourself and you can!. Still I get why you wouldn’t go through the exhaustion"
tumblr,fi6dj75,t1_fi6d0hx,1582189549.0,"Yes she says it very well. I wish to travel the world on my own. Without people harrassing me or people feeling the need to constantly help me. I mean I have a complex of not accepting help, but when I am traveling I don’t need a man to hold my hand. 

I met a lot of great, sweet and helpfull (in a good way) men on the way. It’s sad that there will always be a rotten apple to spoil the whole basket"
tumblr,fi6a1wo,t1_fi5p6lw,1582184880.0,"I hate this so much tho. I am traveling at the moment and one of the things I learned is don’t trust men. I hate it so much! 

I will have an awesome conversation with the most interesting people and lef my guard down with the wrong person and almost get myself in a bad situation. I wish I could just trust them, talk to them, accept their “friendly” things. But no, you gotta keep your guard up and be the strong woman. Or else one of the guys is not to be trusted and you end up in an ally somewhere. 

(Tbh this could come from older or poor women too, but in my expierence they are less “aggresive in their actions.)"
insaneparents,fi3glis,t1_fi3g3lc,1582118176.0,Thank so much! I think I was an angry teen. But I do think having someone around telling you the whole time you’re not beinh happy or cheerful enough wasn’t helping! Now that I am almost NC and out of the house I feel way better
