sex,fqv1fo5,t1_fquvv1o,1589667956.0,"First, you should go back and read what I actually wrote. I didn‚Äôt imply she should say it without nuance, but the number of women I know who‚Äôve been stealthed in recent years have skyrocketed. It exposes women to STDs, pregnancy, and has legally been designated as ‚Äúrape‚Äù....and the guys who tend to do it are the ones who make a fuss about not wanting to wear a condom.

My advice is simple, but I‚Äôll clarify it:

A) Beware of new lovers who whine about wearing condoms. It says they do do so as little as possible and so are high risk for STDs. It also says their experience is detached from the lady‚Äôs enjoyment or comfort. So guys who whine about ‚Äúhaving to wear condoms‚Äù are most likely the ones to slip them off during sex without concern for the health and well-being of the woman.

B) If a prospective lover is whining about ‚Äúhaving to wear a condom‚Äù she should let him know she‚Äôs hip to what ‚Äústealthing‚Äù is and if he tries it she won‚Äôt just roll with it.

About 1-in-5 women are raped or sexually assaulted in America. I know at least a dozen who‚Äôve been open about it, and most of the time it‚Äôs been someone they knew to some degree, & often date-rape. There are tons of shitty guys who don‚Äôt thing twice about doing whatever THEY want to a woman once sex begins. But a woman can withdraw consent at ANY time, even mid-bang as you put it. And the women with the best chance of avoiding doucheebaggy guys are the ones who vet them before clothes come off.

OP deserves a hassle free love life (as we all do) so I encourage her and everyone to talk about STDs and condoms/birth control before kissing turns to nudity....It‚Äôs easier to walk out the door if you don‚Äôt need to get dressed first.

Worthy guys cater to the woman‚Äôs needs. Guys who drag their feet and beg and plead for no condom/anal/anything the lady isn‚Äôt up for are guys she shouldn‚Äôt be sleeping with. 

That‚Äôs my advice. Hope that clears it up. Would you advise your daughter differently?"

Sex can be wonderful when you have established a basic level of trust, but sex with strangers can got off the rails so (1) be choosy, (2) state clear boundaries, (3) NEVER let them talk you into anything that makes you uncomfortable.

Since most people are not trans the general assumption is people are cis unless otherwise stated. I think it's generally a mistake for trans individuals not to embrace their identity as trans as something to be proud of and treat without concealment. Reason being that hiding it seems like living in a kind of closet where one is either ashamed of their biology and journey or so afraid of the judgements of others that they actively promote the misconception that they're cis.  


Much of the Trans community seems comfortable with that prefix before their self-identified gender and I believe it's the swiftest way to make the Cis community respect the pride in Trans identity while also defusing the dangerous paranoia and the violence that can follow Cis people feeling surprised/deceived/conned by a less than upfront declaration of self.  


""Passing"" may be prudent in places where legal protections don't exist and community sentiment is physically hostile, but in the US wider acceptance generally follows openness.   


Two years is a long time to let a close friend imagine a completely false backstory to yourself. And maybe it was selfish of you to keep validating your sense of womanliness day after day by him not being able to tell. Clearly by his reaction it does make a difference and his feeling of betrayal IS justified. The fact you don't want it to matter doesn't override the fact that it does.

You‚Äôre brother is selfish a-hole. Completely without responsibility to anyone he should be considerate of. He may be close to a narcissistic sociopath or merely temporarily nuts by facing such a life-changing reality as his homosexuality.

You‚Äôre right in that his college fund shouldn‚Äôt be a slush fund for his lifestyle. That‚Äôs fair.

But what you built it for is his education. And right now he‚Äôs not in a head space to peruse that, but it‚Äôs not uncommon for young people his age to slip off track where he‚Äôs not mentally/emotionally ready for it.

What I encourage you to remember is that he will very likely tire of his dead-end, low skill, minimum wage lifestyle and prospects and within a few years likely want...sincerely and with commitment...to go back to school in one way or another and level up his prospects.

As frustrating as it is for you as a parent to see him stall out right now and waste time, without the urgency of desire behind him he can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt fulfill your hopes of his education yet. 

BUT...if you take the long view you might see that he probably will down the road. I‚Äôd tell him you might allow him some small portion of it (say $5-10k) to get out of debt and stabilize his life right now so he can manage on the low salary gigs he and his wife will settle for now.

Make it clear that you haven‚Äôt given up on the idea of him getting more education after a few years struggling without it, and that he‚Äôs free to do his own thing now, you‚Äôll hold onto the remainder of that fund until he turns 28...at which point he either gets into an educational program worthy of it and the sacrifices you made to build it, or you‚Äôll absorb it into your own retirement fund since you‚Äôre the one who earned it and he‚Äôs apparently ‚Äúdoing fine‚Äù without the education you squirreled it away for.

This way you have 5 years to sit on it so it MIGHT get to go where you wanted it to once your boy gets a little more maturity & worldliness to motivate him,...and if no you‚Äôll have an extra $35k to enjoy for yourself guilt-free knowing you responsibly allowed generous flexibility for your son to develop at his own pace.

You get to be the good guy either way and get the prize of an appreciative son who got his shit together a little late OR you get $35k to play with. 

But your kid SHOULD be able to recognize you‚Äôre being a wise and loving dad with your offer that both helps him immediately and tempts him unrushed to think of how much farther he can go in life if he hunkers down with additional schooling in the future.

Claiming the $ for yourself right now would be reactive instead of proactive and miss the opportunity for a long-game that serves you both better while preserving your relationship instead of damaging it with unnecessary resentment.

Patience will serve you better here either way it turns out."

If you think his daughter will resent your son for taking advantage of an opportunity unavailable to her, you haven't fully appreciated the resentment your son will have for all 3 of you for stripping him of a major life opportunity so both kids could get a shittier education together.  


You steal nothing from his daughter by letting your son seize this chance, but you steal the chance from your son for NOTHING in return. NOTHING.  


Life doesn't present opportunities and blessings equally. Only a fool denies them because the Universe won't change that. Don't be that fool. Help your kid like I'm sure you'd help his if the opportunities were reversed."

Veganism is a choice for oneself; not for pets or babies. You should remind your friends numerous vegans have killed their infant children by assigning them an unnatural vegan diet.
