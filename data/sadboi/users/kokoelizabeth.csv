Think of you and him as being on two different paths and it just turns out your paths aren‚Äôt as parallel as you thought. For whatever reason be it his personality or any other factors in his life he is not good at communicating or addressing emotions in a friendship/relationship. Those factors have nothing to do with you and those factors and that behavior is also not your problem. You are a fantastic person and friend for dedicating time and investing your feelings in someone in a genuine way but sometimes people just blow through life and leave open doors on their way out. It‚Äôs perfectly okay for you to shut the door behind him. You are whole with out him I promise.

BipolarSOs,fd26iry,t3_ejcmyf,1578142460.0,"I‚Äôm sorry she is going through some family stuff and changing diagnosis. Unfortunately/fortunately doctors can have varying opinions especially in mental health. It‚Äôs good to seek answers and details  if she has concerns or questions about her diagnosis. 

Communication is sooo important in any relationship but it can make a world of difference in a relationship involving mental illness. Ask her what type of affection she likes most and give it to her. 
Also be creative and thoughtful about ways you might make her feel special ( doesn‚Äôt even hurt to  google cute stuff other people do for their significant others) but make sure to ask her what she likes most, 

Being supportive during her depressive episodes can really depend on what she‚Äôs experiencing and what her depressive episodes look like for her. Sometimes just your calm presence in the room or right next to her is enough to help someone feel supported during a depressive episode, but again use that communication on a day that she seems to be feeling good have a conversation about how she‚Äôs feeling on depressive days if she needs extra affection those days, if she needs help preparing meals and making sure she eats, she might appreciate your help in removing the pressure of day to day tasks on depressive days, she might want you to just tell her it‚Äôs okay and then give her space.  Sometimes she might not know how to explain what she feels or what she needs or wants and she might become frustrated and all you can do is remain calm. 

As far as fine tuning the wording of things that just takes practice. I think the over analyzing is a symptom of the illness. My SO has said that sometimes he feels like his bipolar puts a ‚Äúmean‚Äù filter on everything people are saying. And sometimes I do feel like he assumes the worst of my intentions in what I‚Äôm saying. But it always helps to come back to it later when tension isn‚Äôt so high and reassure him that I am not/was not upset with him or trying to be mean or insinuate any double meanings with whatever I said. You can‚Äôt expect yourself to be perfect with everything you say to her but you can have patience with her when you see that she‚Äôs trying to read between the lines on something when you simply don‚Äôt mean it and take a moment to kindly tell her that you mean well. 

It‚Äôs definitely a trial and error process with lots of talking and slowing down to have conversations about what is happening and how you both are feeling. You seem amazing for seeking advice and taking an interest in helping her feel better. If you ever need to talk, ask questions, or vent my messages are open. It can be tough and it helps to have a support system outside of the relationship and direct circle of contact."

BipolarSOs,fbzvsev,t3_ef5buw,1577264263.0,"Hey. I struggle with this with my SO too. I have a high sex drive and would love to have sex every day if all goes well. But We‚Äôve gone through times in our relationship where he‚Äôs virtually uninterested for weeks on end. Even if he‚Äôs gotten hard and initiated sex and we‚Äôve gotten into it frequently I‚Äôll get the feeling that he‚Äôs just not fully present. It‚Äôs not even always a sign I can point to that makes me feel weird about his reactions but I just do feel a lack of connection there sometimes.

Whenever we talk about it he blames it on his meds. I try my hardest to believe him but of course insecurity creeps in from time to time. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre just as attractive as always and I‚Äôm sure your boyfriend desires that connection you want too. Unfortunately, it can be a side effect of medication to have a low libido"
BipolarSOs,fbzvezm,t3_eezy2y,1577263668.0,"Dude first! Please don‚Äôt beat yourself up about what you signed up for and what you ‚Äúshould have‚Äù known about bipolar. Nothing about bipolar is obvious and it‚Äôs not easy AT ALL. 

It‚Äôs so hard when you feel the divide between you and your SO growing and they don‚Äôt even seem to notice even when you spell it out for them. Then when they come rushing back in it can feel so good. 

Ugh. I am so sorry you‚Äôre going through this,. Please please please take care of yourself. Focus on yourself as a priority. Make peace with their coming and going use this peace to decide if you can live with that factor or to let go of it and move on.

bipolar,fblzat2,t3_edv0oe,1576974202.0,Sorry you‚Äôre going through this. Went through this exact same thing a few months ago with my SO. My advice is to start taking half doses or every other day doses to stretch your last pills out over a couple of weeks. Call you doctors office and see if they‚Äôll work with you at all or maybe just fax a new prescription with out an appointment or anything. Good luck. Maybe ask people to pitch in until you have enough to get your bill squared up
BipolarSOs,faqy2xp,t1_faqpm97,1576309806.0,"THANK YOU FOR SAYING THIS. I am sick to death of seeing people come on posts where someone is seeking advice or direction and someone makes a curt comment suggesting the person with bipolar is completely in control of all their inappropriate behavior or that they must be emotionally abusive and unable to grow or be helped. If they were completely in control of their behavior they obviously would not be struggling with a mental disorder. 

While I totally agree there is a place for self accountability with the person who has bipolar and there is a time to step away and any person has every right to move on from a relationship/friendship involving bipolar the same way they would any other friendship/relationship they‚Äôre finished with, it is steeped in stigma to make such comments suggesting all symptoms of the disorder or medication are a choice or have vindictive intentions."
BipolarSOs,faohtft,t1_faogb70,1576264666.0,Hmmm I can kind of understand that for sure. But ultimately your boyfriend is responsible for managing his illness and he needs some autonomy over that so he can learn to be master over his own life even with bipolar. It is new and mistakes will happen. My boyfriend and I still have followed bad advice or made mistakes with his care and he‚Äôs been diagnosed for many years already even before I met him. So really you guys just have to make the best decision for you and for him. Have you met with his doctor to ask questions for yourself or does he only go by himself.
BipolarSOs,faofzda,t1_fao4fo5,1576263487.0,Is his doctor not wanting him to go just because they feel it‚Äôs risky or because they are wanting him hospitalized during the trip?
BipolarSOs,fao3xz7,t1_fao1w3y,1576256830.0,"It‚Äôs definitely a disorder that changes your life. Being new to the diagnosis can mean he‚Äôll have some shame while coping with the stigma surrounding it and there might even be denial about how he will have to alter his habits and self care routine. But I‚Äôm so glad you guys are able to get some more time together and make the decision for him to step back from school. But it can also mean rescheduling or even missing out on fun things because managing the disorder takes precedence over most other things. That doesn‚Äôt mean you guys will have to miss out in everything over it, but while it‚Äôs new it‚Äôs definitely better to err on the side of caution. If you and him were both more familiar with his signs and how severely his bipolar can affect him you guys would be able to make more of an educated estimate on whether to press on to the trip or not, but for now I wouldn‚Äôt take a lot of risks and give yourselves room for learning. 

If he needs to stay and receive medical treatment would you go to Hawaii or stay back with him?"
BipolarSOs,fao1juh,t1_fao0yrr,1576255425.0,Oh wow I feel silly!! I completely misread your original post ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è oh that‚Äôs definitely a difficult situation. But my advice is still similar he may not notice that he‚Äôs off. His doctor may recognize some concerning behaviors from him. Do you think he has some FOMO or isn‚Äôt wanting to let you down? Is it possible to reschedule the trip? Or plan another one
BipolarSOs,fao0m1v,t1_fanzp6u,1576254832.0,"Gotcha. Something I‚Äôve noticed with my bipolarSO is that some days for seemingly ‚Äúno reason‚Äù normal or mundane tasks or basic socializing becomes difficult or even impossible for my SO. On some days like this there is no pushing through and just making it to our event or there is no having serious or even normal discussions about tasks that should be completed, 

If your boyfriend is telling you he doesn‚Äôt feel up for Hawaii that is a sign of amazing communication skills as sometimes people with BP have a difficult time admitting or recognizing that they feel off. I would definitely not push him into it because that will only increase whatever anxiety he has around the situation and you could end up seeing a full blown episode while you‚Äôre on vacation. Which can be scary enough on its own let alone if you‚Äôre thousands of miles away from home with no quick route to normalcy let alone his doctor or therapist.

There‚Äôs a lot of facets to this disorder and it can be strange and difficult but your SO is still the same amazing person they‚Äôve always been and I love my relationship and my SO all the more for the things we‚Äôve worked through together and learned about each other. My inbox is ALWAYS open if you ever have questions, need advice, or even just need to vent down the line."

BipolarSOs,fabboxg,t1_fabayqj,1575920766.0,"It can definitely feel impossible sometimes. We have our own emotions too and it‚Äôs so easy to get sucked into the arguments and playing into the irrational thinking.

Is he going to regret this conversation later? Does the topic of argument even make sense?‚Äù If the answers are no, yes no.

BipolarSOs,fab7ayb,t1_fab5uhr,1575918842.0,That‚Äôs definitely the illness talking. Also Remind yourself that it‚Äôs completely irrational and while you might care or be hurt that your partner ‚Äúfeels‚Äù this way it‚Äôs not based in reality what-so-ever. I advise you find a time when your SO is in a clear state of mind and check in about this topic. Not to accuse them or to make them feel bad but to say ‚Äúhey I need to check that we both understand that I care about you and love you whether you‚Äôre perfect or not.

I agree some of it is scary and I think knowing about the bipolar just adds a layer to that fear. If anything though I have days where I feel more bonded to my SO because of the things we‚Äôve worked through with the disorder and I feel we‚Äôve had an easier time realizing what needs to be worked on because of the disorder."
BipolarSOs,f4w3nro,t1_f4vsp84,1571851413.0,I‚Äôm glad someone can at least see where in coming from. I try to remind myself that these types of droning arguments can happen with a partner who doesn‚Äôt have bipolar disorder.  I think I just tend to be hard on myself about it because we work so hard to protect our relationship from the negative things that do come along with bipolar disorder that I sometimes forget that some of it isn‚Äôt about the disorder some of the struggles just happen within any relationship.
BipolarSOs,f4w25z8,t1_f4v1cxm,1571850904.0,All of that is so relatable for me! I also do my best to recognize and accept what is and isn‚Äôt ‚Äúreal‚Äù but there are definitely days I have where it‚Äôs harder to handle the mean things or nasty attitude.
BipolarSOs,f4umk91,t3_dlnw7r,1571818020.0,"It sounds like you‚Äôve already gotten to know when it‚Äôs time to just ignore a comment or diffuse and discussion from the ‚Äúother‚Äù person. So the next step is to find good times to discuss what is truly bothering her and also discuss how she should bring up her concerns. Wait for a time she‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe other person‚Äù and she seems clear and have a conversation about boundaries. Kindly let her know that you appreciate her apologies and you know she means well, but follow up by telling her that no matter what if she needs to express her concerns about something that you would like if she did not compare you to her ex for any reason. I would focus on one or two of the truly inappropriate things she‚Äôs says to you at a time, but she needs to remember that certain things are not okay.

It‚Äôs also really helped my SO and I if I made sure to take time to validate and address his actual concerns (not the meanness or any rude comments)  later when we both felt more neutral about whatever it was. I feel like doing this helped him to be less aggressive/offensive later on when we have those difficult days."
BipolarReddit,f4uk29z,t3_dlout8,1571814274.0,"If there truly is no one else in his family or close circle that is more equipped to have the conversation with him then I recommend you very kindly point out to him that you‚Äôve noticed he doesn‚Äôt seem okay and that you‚Äôd fully support him in notifying his doctor of these changes. Let him know that you care about him and you wouldn‚Äôt bring this up if you weren‚Äôt genuinely noticing some thing that had you second guessing his behavior. I obviously don‚Äôt know him every well, but chances are he feels it too and just doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that bad if no one else is noticing. 

If it at all applies to your/his situation I would make sure to communicate with at least one family member (or loved one) who is trusted by him and very familiar with his mental health history simply to keep someone else in the loop as a resource. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt involve distant/uninvolved family members or friends who he wouldn‚Äôt otherwise talk to about his mental health. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt use this person to stage some kind of intervention-esque conversation about his mental health unless you have a genuine emergency on your hands, but it can be very helpful to have another person in the loop about what is going on."
BipolarReddit,f4ujdx5,t3_dlu00n,1571813342.0,"I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs you. I just want to stress that it‚Äôs not your illness becuase I deeply love someone who has bipolar. But it‚Äôs probably just not your time. 

Finding true and reciprocal love takes a lot more than good looks or anything superficial. It takes a bit of luck and a whole lot of personal growth and self reflection even prior to finding that love. A lot of people experience many different types of love and relationships some people only experience a few or just one.  

Do you have anyone in your personal life that you have talked to about this?"
TheLastAirbender,f4rmbzg,t1_f4p7hpp,1571769340.0,I can make myself cry if I think to seriously about tale of Iroh
Parenting,f4rkqqn,t1_f4rjk0a,1571768759.0,Right! At the very least it sets the girls up to have a misunderstanding of appropriate boundaries which could lead to someone else harming them even if that isn‚Äôt his intention.
TheLastAirbender,f4k2cr6,t1_f4h6fhq,1571632874.0,"I loved this episode because it is actually a huge development for Zuko and for Aang individually as well as for their new friendship. Zuko learns for the first time that fire bending and the very roots of the fire nation are not what he (or even we) thought they were. Aang and Zuko both rediscover fire bending for what it truly is and use this knowledge to bond with each other and then later on to redefine the course of history and how they redirect the fire nation after dethroning Ozai. We (as well as Aang and Zuko) also gain insight into Iroh‚Äôs own redemption arc by learning that he actually saved the dragon species rather than dealing the final blow in dragon extinction. Contrary to the initial comment on this episode, I actually feel it is a very deep and emotionally impactful piece of the series."
TheLastAirbender,f491mg9,t1_f48yjck,1571454837.0,It‚Äôs really good! Just a very different feel than Aang.
TheLastAirbender,f45lukt,t1_f44rw74,1571383032.0,It‚Äôs really not.
TheLastAirbender,f45lkbo,t1_f40c5qv,1571382617.0,THANK YOU!! I had to scroll way too far down to see someone make the point that Korra can barely hold her own to regular benders.
TheLastAirbender,f45lcs8,t3_dittt4,1571382319.0,Fuck my whole life up why don‚Äôt you?
TheLastAirbender,f45l8xz,t1_f42i764,1571382165.0,Very accepting of herself. She‚Äôs very self aware.
TheLastAirbender,f45kyif,t1_f41mel0,1571381752.0,"Also Ozai (a grown ass man) was literally prepared to sacrifice his young son‚Äôs life and ultimately gave his wife‚Äôs livelihood in exchange for the assassination of his own father to usurp his grieving brother and rule a tyrannical empire which would aimlessly destroy the lives and communities of millions of people. He publicly assaulted and maimed his teenage son followed by a virtually causeless disowning and deportation of said battered son. He also commanded a word wide man hunt with the intention of indefinitely imprisoning and likely torturing a 12 year old child in order to control the avatar spirit. Azula was a control freak and a narcissistic asshole, but at the very least we can see that her aggressive behavior is heavily influenced by her psychopathic father and her ambitions are not much different than Zuko‚Äôs. She just has the ego/confidence to match her talent and never gets exposed to life outside of royal life. She‚Äôs cruel and lives in an echo chamber of her own creation and fails learns empathy, but fortunately doesn‚Äôt get to become the fully grown ‚Äúevil‚Äù that Ozai is."
TheLastAirbender,f45jr3e,t1_f422le7,1571380109.0,Maybe I‚Äôm lame but I loved finding out that Aang wasn‚Äôt above a little fibbing to work his avatar peace making magic. Reminds us that he‚Äôs still a kid and we can teach/learn valuable lessons through fables and story telling.
TheLastAirbender,f45j0u8,t1_f41dvx6,1571379160.0,Excuse me. How dare you make me cry like this?
TheLastAirbender,f45itvk,t1_f45ifxc,1571378917.0,Super cool! I believe I was 13 the first time I saw ATLA and now I‚Äôm 25. I think it‚Äôs really cool that kids are still watching it for the first time around that age. üòÅ
TheLastAirbender,f45imi1,t3_djeipw,1571378657.0,Gives me goose bumps every time I watch her say that.
TheLastAirbender,f45ij3k,t3_dji22a,1571378536.0,"She doesn‚Äôt choose. The ‚Äúavatar‚Äù is a reincarnation of Wan. Raava is simply bonded to Wans spirit, so wherever his sprit is born she exists. It‚Äôs all been predetermined by fate."
TheLastAirbender,f45i5vi,t3_djh44f,1571378075.0,It‚Äôs very cool to watch the show over again when you‚Äôre older and realize all these cool details about the show. Ugh I could watch the show a 1000 times and never stop being impressed or finding new things to love about it.
bipolar2,f2no1ai,t1_f2nn1ta,1570318055.0,ahh I see what you‚Äôre saying. It really seems like you‚Äôre doing your best though and you seem very understanding of how these things might affect your significant other. At least you guys can keep communicating. I really hope he is able to accept you for who you are and build some patience and understanding with your bipolar. You both need to support each other through this and I hope that‚Äôs how it happens for you guys.
bipolar2,f2lr58t,t3_ddnlwx,1570297458.0,‚Äúthis keeps happening‚Äù is a clear sign that he doesn‚Äôt realize what he‚Äôs signed up for. I know it sounds extreme but I would re-evaluate if he‚Äôs the right fit for you. I‚Äôm sorry.
Animesuggest,f28ybni,t1_f288ubj,1570074106.0,I hear you on this! Even if I don‚Äôt like an anime if I start it I do my best to push past season one. I almost never regret it. Some anime‚Äôs just take some time to hook you.
pottytraining,f1dlof1,t1_f1dlmkv,1569388771.0,I was gonna say they really just need to give him time to adjust. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs getting better for you guys (:
