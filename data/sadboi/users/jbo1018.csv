I dont know what changes to the spawn logic they made for dom but it has by far the absolute worst spawns imaginable.  Im guessing they make it more lienent to make it harder to 3 cap and/or spawn trap but god...its like every game on a smallish map i get an unavoidable death loop or 5 or 6 ususally more than once. On shipment i would say i can understand but even when it was 5v5 and everyone from both teams was on one side of the map i still spawn into an enemies gun barell 3-5 times in a row and it can be just as bad on rust or shoothouse.
