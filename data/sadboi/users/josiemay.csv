womensbodybuilding,fnewscm,t3_g14vnk,1586897309.0,"Yes!!! Work on improving mind muscle connection and form. Reduce your rest time (in a safe manner of course), use a higher rep range (15-30 reps, I think women can generally get away with this range and make gains) and you can stick with light weights and still make the exercise difficult, using hip thrusts as an example, make the pause at the top a little longer, or do a little pulse or two between each full rep, you can make these types of adjustments to most exercises to make them more difficult without increasing weight."
veganbodybuilding,fkx343l,t3_fkydmz,1584616980.0,"I would say if your goal is to gain lots of muscle then definitely bulk. You can really maximise beginner gains if you eat at a surplus and you can just lose the fat later when it's easier as your bmr will be higher then.
You're only going to be gaining muscle at your current rate for another year or so really so imo take advantage! If you don't mind gaining some more fat. You could always do a mini cut if you get uncomfortable with the weight gain."

Botchedsurgeries,fbdr33j,t1_fbdqaap,1576769394.0,That's exactly why it was added. Female bodybuilders got a lot of flack in the past for being masculine which was driving people away from the sport. They added some new divisions and started judging face and femininity to attract more people.
Botchedsurgeries,fbdndk2,t1_fbdn4vd,1576766857.0,"Female bodybuilders have a few extra categories they are scored on. Hair, makeup, suit, femininity, poise and beauty along with the usual things like muscularity, conditioning, stage presence and tan."

Botchedsurgeries,fbd9thj,t1_fbd8mzd,1576754139.0,"Getting down to the low body fat levels required to compete usually makes your boobs disappear. Since female body builders are still expected to look ""feminine"" especially in the bikini division, lots (especially more serious competitors) get implants. Female bodybuilders are also judged on their suit, and not filling out the cups looks like a bad fit so they would be marked down. You can use padding though too."

I would do extra sets and drop sets to make sure I was really getting a good burn/pump. Can you do cable kick backs and cable front squats? Or cable anything really you can use less weight for a similar muscle response might be worth trying it out.
ETA if you are managing with light deadlifts, try single leg Romanians with support (put one leg on a bench for example) again you can use much less weight and get a really good glute burn."

You can totally do this, go for a walk, have a bath with a bath bomb, stay away from people if you have to but it will pass. And when it does, your baseline mood will significantly improve. Quitting nicotine (ime) is harder than weed cause the withdrawals suck but it is short lived and will be so worth it."

It's super laid back, every day is different from the hands-on lab stuff to bigger ongoing projects. It isn't the most well-paid job in this industry but it's incredibly fulfilling and has a LOT of job autonomy. No-one has told me what to do since I was a trainee years ago and there are lots of career development opportunities. It's easier to say than to do, but try to push through the anxiety and go to the fairs they can be great ways to meet people in your industry! ETA just wanted to post my experience because I saw a few comments dismissing tech jobs as boring and unfulfilling which has not been the case for me at all. Many of our techs go on to complete PhD's, go into industry or just climb the ladder in the Uni."
