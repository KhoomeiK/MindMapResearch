notti rovinate da un prurito insopportabile
mi strapperei la pelle se potessi
il sonno curerebbe ogni mia parte fragile
ma esso è timido e sporadico
un po' come i miei testi

odia esser ricercato
non gli importa di esser apprezzato
nell'agire lui si affida solo al caso
e poi rimane schiavo del passato

non mi resta altro 
che sognare ad occhi aperti e ricordare
gli amici mai avuti o ormai perduti
i momenti mai vissuti come quella estate al mare
o quella sera che passammo a baciarci e ballare

--

ed io lo so
che non doveva succedere
ma adesso chiudo gli occhi
e brucio nel mio essere

ed io lo so
che mi poteva succedere
ma adesso chiudo gli occhi
e mi avvolgo nella cenere

--

notti passate a cercare un respiro
a godersi un passato inventato  
a schernire quei sogni infantili
per poi aprire gli occhi e fissare il vacuo

legato ai polsi da un lenzuolo fine
imprigionato a un antico tàlamo
sotto la mole di cento piume 
le stesse che issarono il giovane dedalo 

ed ardo in fuoco che genera scuro
cieco in un denso velo di fumo
brucio nel nero dei miei pensieri
e prima o poi sbatteró contro un muro

--

ed io lo so
che non doveva succedere
adesso chiudo gli occhi
e brucio nel mio essere

ed io lo so
che mi doveva succedere
adesso chiudo gli occhi
e mi avvolgo nella cenere

--

affido all'alba il mio prender sonno
tutto s'illumina ed ha inizio il giorno
cullato dal canto dei foschi merli
io come cenere immobile dormo"

depression,fbuo8dg,t1_fbul5qu,1577117703.0,"power can be innocence and beauty i never specified anything. reality is that if you dont have it (and the majority of people dont let s be honest) in this society you will have to beg and work for other people. 
and if you dont have any kind of utility for them then your value in your society is zero (im not gonna discuss about the intrinsic value of life and such philosophical matter).

""Human relationship are fluid formless things based on mutual consent""
and that mutual consent it s that ""trade and get along part"" i told u about: i didnt mean material trades only, i was talking about trust.
trust is a powerful weapon simply because groups of people that work togheter and believe in each other are 100x more efficient, faster and stronger.
and here comes the formation of groups. ok all cool? no. because you are gonna meet other groups that you ve never seen and you dont trust. so what do? simple:

1- wait them to kill your group and rob you of everything you own 

2- you kill them and rob them first 

3- you try to enstablish a relationship based on mutual consent, backed up by promises, reciprocal advantages and trading in general.

well now you have a bigger group that will eat all other smaller groups: it doesnt really matter if it s by force or by enstablishing even more agreements  (the bigger group is the one in power anyway).
