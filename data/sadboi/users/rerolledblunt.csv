Not your business if she went to college or became a young mother, works, any of it. Maybe she sticks around home because her parents need her help. Who knows? Not you and it doesn't matter. They live there as a family so sounds like it's still a family neighborhood, just they fail to live to your ""standards"".

AmItheAsshole,fpq2uis,t3_gen5oh,1588814062.0,"Yta. You're also wrong. My boyfriend is black and keeps his thick, curly hair long. To not deal with it he throws it in a ponytail or bun most days and it just knots up until he finally has the time to work out the knots. He doesnt do a full hair wash everyday because it can and will take an hour or more. I assume your roommate has the same hassle.

So, yeah, his natural hair can take hours just to look ... natural. It involves conditioning, and keeping the hair moisturized as youre unknotting/ removing clumps of knotted hair in his case. In his case he isnt applying styling products (other than coconut oil which he uses to condition), just literally combing through knots. Your ignorance to other hair types doesnt excuse you from being TA and you should consider why all those people see you as racist. There is a reason."

AmItheAsshole,fpddjaq,t3_gcqlbb,1588524868.0,"NTA. This is all difficult but you've tried and tried and he just doesn't actually like the food and can't accept it. Sure, maybe cook some simple japanese style meals if he can give you examples or requests with the ingredients you still have, just to use them up. I'd also make a regular side dish for yourself with a little extra.  This way when he inevitably doesn't like the food you could offer him the other meal and ease him into eating your regular cooking again.



My sister did something like this when she got really into anime and Japanese style when we were kids. She decided out of the blue she loved and needed sushi which we had never had so my aunt and uncle got us some from a nice place, she took one bite and gagged and ran off crying. 

He wants to mimic what he likes but he just... doesn't like it. It's not anybody's fault. 

Another idea.. maybe you can order him some Japanese candy or snacks to have instead? Something to help with the fixation. Pocky is pretty popular and even is sold in my local walmart. I think a lot of noodles/soups are popular in Japanese culture too,that might be do able. 

Good luck with everything. You sound lovely."

So it isn't the healthiest or most caffeinated, but it makes him happy and sends him to work with a smile.

FLMedicalTrees,feah9y6,t1_fea8bts,1578948717.0,People at work are already SOL by not being able to physically be there to get minis... which are in store only.
FLMedicalTrees,fe9674f,t1_fe92pcs,1578934713.0,"Edgewater is awful about this. They'll check their little section but not the other side where the other tenders are. I've had this happen with flower and rosin at that location. It's kinda just lazy. 


Meanwhile at Orlando my budtender had no skywalker on her side so called across the room to her coworker to check if he had any because she recalled seeing it and sure enough they had it."
BPD,fdtsqwb,t3_emyry4,1578721615.0,Thank you for making it through the day. I'm glad you're here posting this.

bathandbodyworks,fdicvcf,t3_eli62v,1578440025.0,"Yep. I got a pumpkin pie cracked straight down the side. Of course theyre totally sold out so after a week of processing my replacement they cancelled it and refunded me in 2 different transactions, excluding the tax charged. It's just all around a bad experience ordering online and praying it arrives not broken.

Edit for a word"

FLMedicalTrees,fd3fw34,t1_fd3a249,1578157910.0,"Lol, i thought it was obvious i meant the dispensary giving benefit such as swag, etc for showing up. Sorry for not specifying that?"
FLMedicalTrees,fd37b9l,t3_ejycas,1578155388.0,"I went, it was just a few patients there and they served coffee and bagels from Panera. It's the first Saturday of each month. We just talked about life, our experiences with different mmj products, nothing too special or any extra benefits given for being there.



Edit: i guess it wasn't clear. By benefit i mean it isn't an event where you get swag or anything extra for showing up. It's a purely social event."
xboxone,fc5e46i,t3_eg7a1i,1577454850.0,Thanks for being you
relationships,fb86pfp,t3_ebusdk,1576607338.0,"Like a lot of others have said, it isn't true that once a cheater always a cheater but this was twice AND with the same guy. I would suggest you leave. Enjoy the concert without her and stop making her the center of the universe. Imo shes proven shes very capable of cheating again or just up and leaving for this other guy."
FLMedicalTrees,fakrp61,t1_fak4r3v,1576172033.0,Every RSO should be strain specific. On the pack it will say what it is extracted from. I had a budtender that didnt know either and had to point out where it showed the strain.
AmItheAsshole,fad389q,t1_fad157i,1575953954.0,tbh the way its written i wonder if by drug addict she means the gf smoked pot or tried shrooms as a teen
FLMedicalTrees,faaci1i,t3_e8arhh,1575906922.0,They posted on FB to wait for the location delivery text. Pretty annoying since they completely stopped sending those after doing it for all of 1 week.
bathandbodyworks,fa6vute,t3_e7saqw,1575829064.0,"That's my favorite!! I have 5 at home right now. I just loooove walking into my bedroom when it's burning.

I also love champagne toast and the rose water & ivy! Great haul."
socialanxiety,f8s4erq,t3_e1sp2t,1574768678.0,I rehearse conversations all the time. Even ones that have no chance of happening or have already happened. And yeah i never verbalize what I'm thinking the same way i just end up sounding dumb.
FLMedicalTrees,f8pft02,t3_e1ibiw,1574700831.0,"Yeah this is one of the worst feelings. I've had to arrive before open to have a chance to get flower, then been told they have no delivery yet and no idea when. I think this is part of why they started this whole text upon delivery thing. I just got one for Orlando at 11:30.. not that it helps when it's still a 35 minute drive."
Anxiety,f8eznfo,t3_e0fhsz,1574536219.0,Congrats :)  I'm glad to be reading your post. You took the step ♡
FLMedicalTrees,f8bogd5,t3_e020vk,1574441638.0,No text for Orlando and I can see the website has updated stock for that location.
AmItheAsshole,f84is41,t1_f84hqwg,1574250506.0,"YTA. People can read and enjoy comics as a hobby without being obsessed and memorizing every detail like you. They just wanted to enjoy themselves and you had to prove yourself as superior.

Honesty op you come off as the typical annoying know it all in this story and it sounds like your roommate and all his friends felt the same."

AmItheAsshole,f4r9gki,t3_dlfmy6,1571764638.0,"NTA. You dont have to force yourself to feel crappy by having them over as they insult you. Even if it is a joke to them, you have made your feelings clear. It would kill me to know i hurt my grandpa so bad."
FLMedicalTrees,f46g00m,t3_djo2dk,1571408293.0,Theyve held it for me before for 24 hours about 1 month ago. I guess they changed the policy if they told you otherwise.
