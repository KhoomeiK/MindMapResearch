Psoriasis,f8v4sb8,t3_e2d9lc,1574859458.0,"Yeah, the metallic smell is probably blood because you accidentally scratched too hard. Used to happen to me all the time. Definitely go to a derm. They sometimes prescribe a scalp foam. Its alcohol based so it might sting but it alleviates the itch a bit. Like other people are suggesting try T shampoo. Its strong so dont use it everyday. Comb your hair thoroughly and then apply the foam or shampoo."

BorderlinePDisorder,f6pueaq,t1_f6po39x,1573064484.0,We were in a difficult situation. She tried to end it before...but  we didn't know what we felt for each other. Other people got involved and there was a constant pull and push between us. I love her dearly and wish her love and happiness. Things turned out this way because they had to. I'm content. It just wasn't meant to be.
BorderlinePDisorder,f6pmjs7,t3_dsfuvg,1573059638.0,"Not me but i loved a girl who seems to havr BPD. She pushed everyone away , including me. I told her i loved her and she loved me too. We even talked about the pushing and pulling. I was willing to wait, give her space or pull her back if she needed me to. In the end, I gave up. We both moved on. I doubt she still loves me move ,I still love her ,but I've moved on."
mentalhealth,f6oeuue,t3_ds7nve,1573015472.0,"Sounds like all of you need counseling. Idk how much it'll help, I've gone/going through something similar, but can you make your mom and yourself an appointment with a psychologist? For depression, suicidal risks. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy would be good for you. Its basically what you're doing. By speaking out what going on and then the other party giving advice from an outside perspective.  
I'm not a doctor,  but if you need help with venting or talking I'm here for you. Other people too.

If you make less than $20,000 a year you qualify for healthfirst.  Its in NY idk about what state or country you're in. There are also some clinics that charge 15-30 per session, some even make exceptions. 

Try to look up  information locally , in school, or internet. I used to get free counseling at school and then was given some references. It's hard to accept help but sometimes you just HAVE to grab the help you need for you betterment.

Goodluck,

Message me and we can look together."

1. Outlets- play with him in order to tire him out.

2. Places to hide -maybe a basket!

3. Places to climb- cat tree or empty space above a shelf!

Cats are weird a cookie , so everything's trial and error.

I suggest,  checking out Jackson Galaxy on YouTube . He's got informational videos.

Good luck!"

cults,f61jl44,t3_cmm55a,1572641294.0,"I was part of IYF and I hated it. I was fresh into my 3rd year of college , had been through a rough patch and was sitting alone minding my own business inside my campus while i was approached.  I was promised free korean classes and volunteering so i hopped to it. I wanted to learn and do some good. It was the most bullshit experience ever. I truly regret it. I dedicated time and money in IYF and I was naive.
 I had never heard of cults from where I'm from so I didn't think any of it.
 Later on because i was busy with work , my life and other things they alienated me and even took stuff i had left. Called me fake, a flake and other stuff. I said fuck it and never went back.
  A member saw me last year saw that i was working in an uppity place and invited me back. Hell to the fucking no."

NoStupidQuestions,f55sm02,t3_dg5345,1572013035.0,"I have cracked the code!!!! And it has to do with your food schedule and the time it takes for you to poop.

So this is what you might want to do:

Find out how long it takes you to poop.

Preferably during the weekend or whenever you have time.

Eat spicy stuff. Keep in mind WHEN you ate. Next time you have the firery shoots count how many hours passed from digestion to show time. 

Now you know your poop schedule!Thats the time period that you have to keep in mind. To adjust in order to schedule your bathroom time.

So, i accidentally just confirmed that my pooping schedule runs on an 8 hr schedule.
 I just had the firiest of poops at work. I also ate spicy vietnamese food at 1 am. (Never again!) Which made me poop at 9 am. I have officially decided, no more food after 6pm in order to not poop early in the morning. Let's see if it works! 

I also have tried holding it in ,as some orther people have suggested ,but it gives me horrible stomachaches, also if you eat something spicy its super hard to hold it in....

Good luck! Hopefully we will be able to control our nature !"
