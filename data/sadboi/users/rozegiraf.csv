Cause saying the standard shit like 'go do stuff you like, find a new hobby' probably aren't going to help you. Probably won't be enough, since that is probably not the reason you hate life. 

I think that once you start to like yourself more, you will also start to like living again. I'm not sure, but to me it would make sense that those two go hand in hand.

StopSelfHarm,fk09kiq,t3_ffraqx,1583748481.0,"I've done an exercise in therapy that really helped me. It goes as follows:

- Selected a few positive characteristics about yourself. Even if you don't fully believe in it, surely there are some things that are good about you. Otherwise ask someone you trust what they think is a positive thing about you

- write a story about this positive charactistic, a story that shows why this characteristic suits you and why it is a good thing. It can be a situation in which this came out very clear or when someone was complementing you about it, anything

The meaning behind this exercise is that you focus on your positive sides and make them just as important as the negative sides. Loving yourself means there is a balance between what you like and don't like about yourself. If you base your image of yourself on negative aspects, why not also on the positive aspects?
