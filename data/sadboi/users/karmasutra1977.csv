mentalillness,fqn8b9n,t3_gjkig2,1589490366.0,"No.  Someone with OCD is LESS likely to harm someone; people with MI in general are LESS dangerous, unless they have command hallucinations (hearing voices that tell you to do X).  His self dx sounds correct.  Why does he have to wait until Fall for help, though?  I’d encourage him finding a therapist before then.  Your college isn’t going to have a therapist skilled in OCD treatment, which is exposure-response therapy; it’ll be a few free meetings where he’s referred to a therapist anyway.  When I first entered treatment for OCD, I was also in college with no money, but there are places that will see you on a reduced fee schedule.  I used to get samples of medications from a psychiatrist who charged me $10 per visit.  Being stuck in your head like that is fairly hellacious, I feel for you guys.  If he does not have OCD, there’s some real bad anxiety going on.  He can go to a medical MD for a blood test to make sure there’s nothing medical (stuff like vitamin b-12 deficiency, thyroid problems, inflammation, and sleep apnea can cause severe anxiety and other problems; best to rule that stuff out first).  Then the med MD can treat medical stuff if that’s going on, some will try an SSRI, some will refer out, depends on the MD and what’s going on."

That thought calms me, somehow.  But I no longer beat myself up about everything-every thought used to be filtered through my abusers/parents in my head.  Shame used to prevail everything I did and thought because my parents taught me to be ashamed of everything about myself, even my future self.  Weight, looks, grades, friends - nothing was off limits for ridicule.  Gross.  Took a lot of therapy and it took forever for me to understand that it is ok for me to have self esteem (I thought I didn’t deserve it, questioned how one earns that right).  I don’t need emotional armor around narcissistic soul suckers anymore, just the self esteem to walk away from their crazy, to leave the other end of the rope on the floor.

DSPD,fqidjff,t1_fqi8fnt,1589394562.0,"That is generally how it works; you have to see your GP and then they refer you to a sleep specialist.  If you want a diagnosis, you have to see a sleep MD.  If your sleep is off by several hours, they’re going to try to find something else wrong so they can pretend they’re giving you treatment.  Like I wear a CPAP for the least treatable amount of apnea, and have lost 40 lbs, so I don’t really need the mask - but you can be sure it’s only thing they talk about at my MD appts, so they feel like they can pat themselves on the back for treating something.  DSPD talk is, “well, no one else is going to change your sleep patterns but you.”  Ha, and another ha.  Your experience will differ for sure, and there is someone on this sub who has a sleep MD with DSPD (lucky!), but I think that expecting any kind of quick fix would be met with sadness.  Read as much as you can about it before you go to the MD and bring a sleep log with you, start now just writing down when you sleep, how long you lay in bed, how much sleep you get, and how you feel the next day.

Leads to isolation and depression if it goes very long, and pretty quick for me.  But for sure, I need to just clock out of all life for a few hours or a day or two every once in a while.

adhd_anxiety,fpq7lf0,t3_gem8zg,1588816774.0,"This is really a question for your psych doc, because all of the answers here are going to be anecdotal and body chemistry, circumstances, etc. are vastly different for everyone.  My experience with clonazepam: I have depression and anxiety, ADHD, and a sleep disorder that requires ADHD meds.  So I take Lexapro 20 mg, Clonazepam .5mg, Adderall 10 mg BID, and NAC (N_acetyl cycstine-completely gets rid of cuticle biting and endless repetitive songs, so I count it as important as a prescription even tho it is OTC - 1000 mg BID).  I’ve been through therapy twice for a total of nine years now, and I have gotten rid of some of the chronic pain that I had by having 2 surgeries within the past 6 months.  I think I had a TON of inflammation that was causing depression.  I don’t have any anxiety whatsoever now, which is nuts - but I also did a lot of work on myself and my behaviors and thoughts to get here.  That’s the key.  A pill can help you so much.  Anyway, I was prescribed clonazepam a long time ago, to counter really horrible anxiety the SSRI didn’t get rid of - and it worked, for a while.  Until I couldn’t really tell what it was doing anymore.  When I was prescribed Ritalin like 2 years ago, I needed to take more Clonazepam to stop the anxiety from that, but then I tried Adderall, and at 10 mg it doesn’t give the creepy feeling Ritalin did.  I mean, if you take .5 mg Clon. for like 10 years, not sure what it does, because now I basically use it for sleep.  If I don’t take it at night, not sleeping more than like a nap length.  I’m not sure what degree I need it for my mental health vs. avoiding with withdrawal effects.  I’m tapering off my Lexapro, with my doctor and therapist’s ok.  I’m doing ok coming off of it, am doing a quarter pill reduction every 2 weeks.  Slow is the key.  I don’t know if I’ll be able to taper off the clon as fast, but I do intend to try to taper.  I don’t know what to think about clonazepam; I’ve thought of it as a necessary evil forever.  I know that during panic attacks, it was a lifesaver, and I will probably always just carry an “in case” tablet with me, but I probably will never need it.  It’s one of those things that if you NEED it, definitely take it.  But I don’t know if given the script today if I’d take it every day, mainly because I know the sleeplessness that will happen when I stop taking it.  I also think it’s made me a bit numb to things.  Up in the air as to whether that’s more the Lexapro or the Clon, but we will see.  It’s very possible it’s been messing with my sleep and other stuff that had a negative impact on me as a while, who knows.  I intend to find out."

They usually live at the top of the food chain with their manipulative ability to make you think they know things you don’t or that they have their pulse on the key to life.  Yeah, they don’t.  I think I used to get bullied because I didn’t understand boundaries, personal boundaries.  I grew up in a chaotic neglectful house, and I had to fend for myself a lot plus the added bonus of getting bullied by my parents.  They didn’t like or understand that I think and do things differently, and certainly did not teach me boundaries.  It took a while in therapy for me to effectively learn about and use boundaries, but I will say that I think it’s the only way to stay sane long term.  I got so tired of being a doormat and not feeling like I had any power at all that I had to change.  Boundaries restore your power and allow you to protect yourself from bullying."

Your loved ones will likely understand if you just tell them what’s going on, that you feel rage immediately when things frustrate you, and you aren’t sure how to deal with it yet.  Tell them to give you space.  But in the meantime, you HAVE to work on your rage.  So get another therapist who understands all the facets of what you’re dealing with and get diagnosed so you can get proper help.  I’ve had a lifetime of depression and anxiety and ADD.  The thing that leads to rage immediately is my ADD because it controls executive function, and that’s the thing that will piss you off because it feels like you should be able to do these things but your brain isn’t set up like other people’s.

I like to tell people what makes sense for me is that an ancestor or two must’ve had to stay up all night to look out for danger to protect themselves or their family, and that sleep pattern imprinted genetically on down to me.  It doesn’t serve a purpose in our modern world, but the way things are changing right now and people being able to work from home, I see hope for more flexible schedules for us DSPDers.

TrueOffMyChest,foxz5dz,t3_g9xr2s,1588161027.0,"Get into a pattern of saying no more often to people, and shut off your phone or put it down.  I promise you, it is ok to not talk to a person for 1 day.  They can wait.  Especially that crap with sitting on a video chat watching people breathe?  NO!  You can’t do that.  You’re drained already.  For real recharge your batteries.  Use your time as your own and don’t give so much away.  It’s a valuable commodity.  It sucks walling yourself off from everyone, so you don’t want to isolate, but you do not have to feel like you must correspond to everyone else’s whims.  If you don’t put up boundaries, people will run over you."
CPTSD,fox9gh5,t3_ga2oo8,1588137478.0,"I think that yes, might be stunting your growth a bit if you’re isolating that hardcore.  I just realized a few months ago how much I mask my true self and I was also staying home a ton.  I started to go out and meet people while being myself for real, with the attitude of “if they don’t like me, there are 8 billion other people in the world, who cares?!”  and I started going to the gym after a 20 year hiatus.  I was feeling better: no depression or anxiety, and I never thought rhat would happen.  Now that I’m forced to be home, I recognize how much good getting out of the house did me.  A lot.  Exercise, too.  I’m starting to enter a new depression.  I just got out of a lifetime of it, and I can feel it creeping in.  It could be that we’re in a pandemic and I need to chill but stupid ass anxiety!"

Adderall is smooth and I can focus.  That’s me, though.  Everyone is completely different and asking this is really just going to give you a gamut of answers, it’s going to be your body and a bunch of factors specific to you as to how it will work.

I’m yelling at myself for stopping, but really, I just need to heal (just had surgery 5 days ago) and start up again instead of putting so much emotion into it.

Or less, just give them less time, but tell them you’re doing it.  Make it a boundary you stick to so you’re not constantly hearing the same stories of the same stuck people doing the same shit when you’ve asked them to seek help elsewhere.

Empaths can take on the feelings of others, we feel so deeply.  That’s crushing, and if you do it too much, it can feel like you’re drowning in other people’s feelings.  Without space for your own feelings, you drown.  Put up boundaries and stick to them - stuff like saying no to doing too much, limiting how much news you take in, limiting certain draining people access to you - boundaries will keep you feeling more balanced.  We need empathy in the world, so we need you!  Take care.  And you can, to a small degree, just not give a fuck sometimes.  That’s perfectly ok!  Get lost in something and forget about things for a minute.  Peace."

Lots of things do not matter if you’re “doing them correctly” - there’s not one way to do most anything, so it’s fine.  However you do it!  You can always look up how other people do things for tips and see if they work better for you, but I feel like showering is a very personal thing to do and however you wanna is fine.

CPTSD,fogu2d9,t1_fofyqge,1587756983.0,"I think you might have it in your head that it’s your fault and that you don’t know how to do things - neither of these are true.  There is NO ONE WAY!  You may have been taught that but I promise you it is not true.  You know how to do lots of things that other people don’t and vice versa - it’s a thing that JUST IS. There’s no judgement, it’s just a fact.  What helps is if you remember that probably no one is watching you do anything going “oh my god, Lisa!  Why would you fold that towel that way?!”  Like my mom used to to that, but she’s why I have CTPSD.  I used to think I did everything wrong.  That’s not the problem!  The problem is thinking that there is a right vs. wrong way to do stuff and that your value as a person has anything to do with whether you do something well or not.  My advice is to be open minded and try to learn how other people do things, just by watching and asking questions.  Don’t judge them or yourself - just watch.  You’re going to see that people are so different about how they feel about doing things that it doesn’t really matter in the scheme of life and that your value as a person has nothing to do with any of that.  If you want to do something well, put your mind to it to learn how, mindfully.  Be kind to yourself, is what I’m saying.  It just works better to stop blaming and shaming yourself for stuff, in general, I think."

DSPD,fogr3a0,t1_fogfacg,1587756012.0,"I was waiting for you to write exactly what you did!  “I was really feeling like shit...”.   Yeah, because you’re on a stupid sleep schedule-how’d you manage to go to bed at 2 am every night?  I feel like before 4 am, they’d have to medically induce sleep.  And that waking at 9 am shit?  Go away — DSPDers do not need to be awake in the morning.  I don’t care when I sleep, functioning in the morning just isn’t a thing, EVER.   I don’t care if the sun’s up and I’ve gotten a million hours of sleep and conditions are perfect for morning and but oh!  A ROUTINE - YOU’VE GOT A ROUTINE, YOU SIMPLY MUST FEEL BETTER!- I feel like a giant dog turd warmed in the sun and like my brain will seep out of my ears if I have to be forced to function productively from about 7 am to 11 am.  Can’t. Do. It.  Feels like drowning or something.  Those hours are evil and I never want to be awake during them.  Once they have a drug that makes me feel not crazy and in a foggy haze during those hours, then my DSPD will be cured.  I don’t think that’s going to happen, though, because it’s the mirror of a normal person’s sleep - they feel like this when they have to function in the dead of night at 4 am.  Normal people don’t need to function in dead of night, so why should we be expected to do the same?!   I think I just need to move somewhere that people are awake at night more or something - maybe the real cure is a town full of DSPDers where our society functions at night.  As it should be!!!  Yeah, sneaky tests pretending that insomnia help is helpful for DSPD sounds like something evil people would do so they can shame us more when their insomnia cure doesn’t work.  Shame on them."

It’s a hibernation and a complete block out of stimulation from everything.  My true comfort zone.  Perfection.  The problem is when you spend too much time there.  Just balance trying to become more resilient with hibernation, don’t do either too much.  You have to grow, so you can’t crawl into bed every single time you want to-you have to experience life and all of its chaos in order to eventually dampen your visceral experience with life.  Don’t want to half live.  I’ve done that for years now and I refuse to deal with my anxiety by crawling into bed every time I feel anxiety or really any overwhelming feelings.

That way, you’re only focusing on the one thing all the time and even if it feels slow as hell, you’re doing more via this method than the way you’re doing it now.   Feels slow.  You have to build up your tolerance to frustration, which sort of paradoxically starts with getting things done.  If you focus on one goal and get it done, this creates a new path in your brain that you can draw on to give you confidence in the future.  Start with a super small goal.  Literally anything. Build from there."
