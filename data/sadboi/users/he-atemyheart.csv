A lender will straight up tell yah we can approve you for x amount OR and I love this, if you dont qualify the lender will actually tell you step by step what you need to do so that you can qualify for a home loan. Right now interest rates are below 4%. That's amazeballs ok! Also fort wayne has one of the BEST housing markets in the country right now. Homes are appreciating like crazy dude. It is SO worth it, especially on a budget like yours. Please think about it!! As I'm not licensed yet, I cannot actually help you but I can get you in touch the the real estate agency I will be working for (already hired) or I can pur you in touch with a lender if you would like. It's so worth it!!! 
Good luck to you in your search friend!! I wish you the best!
