But fr ya. It’s like I’m there physically but mentally I’m in a place far away."
depression,fqg9ovy,t1_foctzub,1589341017.0,i know this is an old post but i don’t think i’ve related to something like this in so long. it’s like even when ur alone u still can’t take the ‘mask’ off because it’s almost as if ur admitting to yourself how fucked up you are. i know i could write things down but it’s like my brain can’t make myself write it. so i just keep it to myself in my head because that’s the only spot where i know no one can really find it.
Anxiety,eou0aag,t1_emlat5q,1558853282.0,"Sorry about the late reply I don’t really use this account much. But I mean, as far as I know I haven’t had a full out one since around February. Usually I carry around some Ativan with me at all times now so if I feel one coming on I can just take it and it’ll go away. I have really slow digestion that just feels like it goes to a complete stop on vacation so, like, I pretty much don’t eat much. I’ll take a few bites and instantly feel like puking if it’s real bad. Came back negative for gastroparesis so dunno what that’s all about. IBS fucking sucks. I think food is what triggers the attacks since most of them happen when I’m around food or thinking about it. Diet change doesn’t fix the issue so instead I just avoid dairy, wheat, gluten, and raw vegetables. Highkey kinda worried though since I’ll be leaving for Disneyworld in a few days for almost two weeks and I’m packing a whole arsenal of anti-anxiety stuff and laxatives :’)"
