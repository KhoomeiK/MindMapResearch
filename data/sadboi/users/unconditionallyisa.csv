This disorder has to be caused by something, whether it’s environmental, genetic or both. When I go through this shit, I usually feel like I’m crazy. Like I’m the only person who would react in these stupid ways and feel these strong emotions and have these ridiculous delusions which sometimes are COMPLETELY created in my head whiteout ANY outside indication that maybe something is wrong. For example, even if my boyfriend and I had an amazing few days together, and when I leave his place, he’s super affectionate and tells me he loves me and can’t wait to see me, etc., sometimes, after a day or two of being apart, I’ll randomly get paranoid that he doesn’t love me anymore!!! Maybe it’s cause he took half an hour to reply, or some other minuscule, insufflent piece of “evidence.” It’s so exhausting and terrifying!! I wanna get off this damn roller coaster!! I’m sick of flipping back and forth between two very different outlooks like “our relationship is one of the healthiest there is, he loves me so much I can feel it, our life together is amazing and it’s always going to be amazing” and “he’s falling out of love with me, he’s annoyed and disgusted by me, he’s given up on me cause I’m too messed up, don’t text him he’ll just get even more annoyed and grossed out, distance yourself to prepare for him breaking up with you.” IM SO SICK OF IT.

If you begin treatment soon, you can improve your mental health, which will most likely slow down or even halt the process (if you don’t have schizophrenia) and it may actually help quite a bit as well even if you are schizophrenic (or on the schizo-spectrum).

sex,f6kxand,t1_f6kszuw,1572923045.0,"Holy shit.

Oh my god, I’m so sorry all of this has happened and is happening to you :( I’m seriously sad for you. The biggest (HUGE) issue I see here is the part about him watching porn while you give him head and while you had sex. HOLY SHIT. If he had asked you, during a healthy and calm (non-aroused) conversation about your sex life and/or your relationship, “hey babe, what would you think about me watching porn while we’re having sex? Would you be willing to try it? Maybe you could watch porn while we’re having sex too.” Then this would still be pretty messed up, but at least he asked you. But dear god, he pulled out his phone while you were giving him head. He pulled out his phone while you two were having sex. He WATCHED PORN while he was with you!!!! Out of the blue! And the worst part is he thinks it’s okay!!! It’s a super bold move which means he clearly didn’t feel bad about it, plus he downplayed it after the fact when you blew up on him. What the hell!!!! What you said about feeling like he’s using you as a toy? That’s not an exaggeration. I know it hurts to hear, but I’m not joking with you. He WAS using you as a toy. You were his jerk-off machine. Like a flesh light, or a glory hole. He wasn’t thinking about you. He was looking at her. And the feeling of you on his dick?? It didn’t feel like you. It felt like her. I’m seriously so sad thinking about this :(

Second, he compares you to other women and tells you about it???? He tries to convince you to be more like them? He could have asked, “babe, I have a thing for twerking. Are you able to twerk? Would you be interested in learning how and then twerk in front of me / on my dick / on my face? I would love to see you twerk for me, it’d be so hot.” And maybe he smiles at you and gets all flirty and seductive and stuff. “Why can’t you do this for me?” is manipulative. He’s trying to guilt you. He wants you to feel bad for not doing that for him, and he’s implying that you SHOULD do that for him. That’s so messed up! He’s selfish.

Third, he told you when he had jerked off. Why do you think that is? Just cause? No — he was rubbing it in your face that he chose his hand and his screen over you. He felt like you took away his right to send you videos and look at pictures when you’re around so he wanted to spite you.

Four, he dismisses your feelings and tries to make you feel like you’re wrong for feeling what you’re feeling, and that you’re paranoid or too sensitive or whatever other gaslighting manipulative crap he told you. That’s not what a loving partner does. When someone loves you, they respect you and care about you. And that means they take you seriously. They may not agree with your reaction, but they ask you to explain it, they explain their side, and they try to find ways to make you feel more secure, and generally, that includes some sort of compromise.

As for the jerking off part in general, I don’t think there’s reason to be concerned, except for the fact that he jerks off every time you leave. Sex and masturbation are pretty different in terms of the motivation. If he’s the kind of guy who works hard to perform well (and long) for you, and puts in effort to make you feel good, then the sex is probably not gonna be just a few minutes, and it’s not gonna be that easy. It’s gonna be physically demanding, and mentally/emotionally as well. If you two have sex often enough, then it’s fairly reasonable that he would jerk off in-between. Sometimes people (especially guys) just want to get off. They’re not in the mood to be with a person, they’re just looking for a quick release or a quick burst of pleasure, or even just a way to relax. If he’s replacing you with jerking off consistently, and you’re barely having sex, that might be a problem.

You say he’s romantic and sweet but I’m nearly certain that this is just an act he puts on cause he thinks that’s what he has to do. Being a nice guy is not the same thing as being a good guy. He thinks that by acting like a nice guy most of the time, it will overpower the times when he disrespects, degrades and shames you. Your boyfriend thinks his behaviour is okay. The way people treat you is how they feel about you. Forget their words. His words and his actions are not matching up. 

“It’s not that you can’t move it like those girls do — it’s just porn.”

Then why did he watch it while having sex with you? And while you gave him head?

You don’t treat the people you love the way he treats you. I’m so sorry :/"
sex,f6kp2sp,t3_drq2sh,1572917216.0,"I’m in a very similar situation. I know how you feel :/ it’s so painful tbh, and so confusing. I keep wondering if I’m overreacting or paranoid, or if I’m justified. I just don’t know...

My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years. My issue isn’t really that he masturbates (although this does kind of upset/worry me), I’m more concerned with the fact that he views pornographic content — every. single. day.

• follows a ton of Instagram models (actual models, as well as fitness girls, dancing girls, twerking girls, just “sexy” girls in general) and he uses Instagram every day, and likes their posts

• follows a few tumblr blogs with naked women, and beautiful fully dressed women as well, and likes and reblogs their posts

• watches twerking videos on YouTube regularly

• watches female fitness videos on YouTube regularly

• has a TON of photos and videos saved on his computer, sorted into folders -.-

And the one that bothers me the most..

• his reddit account, which he doesn’t know I know about. He comments on posts asking for links and asking what the girl’s name is, he trades photos/videos with other users, he photoshopped a photo of an Instagram model to make her appear naked because apparently she’s a “tease” in all her posts, he “sharpened” a photo of a girl bending over so that it’s less blurry and said something like “I thought you guys would like this.” .......... :/

It just makes me think like.. does he watch live-streams and request things from her through chat? And compliment her? Does he message women asking for photos? I’ve seen that he’s commented on some of their posts making requests like “more of you spreading your legs please” and more. Does he fantasize about cheating on me? Has he texted or chatted with other girls irl? Like girls that he knows? Has he cheated on me?

Reading these things and seeing these reblogs and likes makes me feel like I’m being cheated on (I know this may be an extreme reaction, I’m just describing the emotion it evokes). Maybe I’m over-reacting and this is just regular guy behaviour.. but I can’t help but wonder why he’s doing these things. Does he have a porn addiction? Is he dissatisfied with me or bored of me? Or is he really just tired or not in the mood? From the beginning we both knew I had a higher sex drive than him, but I keep learning these new things about his porn habits and I’m starting to wonder. He claims that he just looks at them cause they look nice and that he doesn’t consider it porn, unless it’s actually sexually explicit like her vagina or if it’s a sex act. But for someone to follow these blogs and “like” them, and do it consistently every day?? There has to be a physiological motivator for this; it’s impossible to seek stimuli without motivation, because if there’s motivation to do something, it’s because there’s a reward. It’s sexual. It’s primal.

The thing is, our relationship is amazing outside of this. We don’t have nearly as much sex as I’d like, but when we do, it’s amazing. He claims he’s attracted to me and he loves me and he would never cheat on me. He says that just because he looks at those women, it doesn’t mean he’s not attracted to me, and he swears that he doesn’t wish I looked like them. I’m also the best sex he’s ever had (and he’s had over 20). I give him the best head he’s ever had, he loves me more than he’s loved the other two girls. He’s super affectionate with me..

If any guys out there could give me some feedback.. if you’re in a relationship with a woman you love and you know you’re going to marry and grow old with, she gives you the best head you’ve ever had, best sex you’ve had, down to do literally anything for you in the bedroom, down to have sex any time and will always say yes, is available to come see you any night of the week... would you still view this excessive amount of porn every day??? Am I just not understanding men? Is this normal? Is he a sex addict or is this a reasonable amount?

And most important, are his reddit habits okay or do you think it’s going too far?"

DeadBedrooms,f6f7qsr,t3_dqx9q8,1572811439.0,"He’s flaky with plans with you, he expects you to sit and wait for him on the off chance he’ll decide he wants you after all, he doesn’t talk to you during dinner, he HUNG UP ON YOU, he called his mom like a fucking baby, he doesn’t realize that sex and time spent together is important for a couple, and clearly he doesn’t care about you because if he did, he would WANT to prioritize time for you and he would WANT to meet your needs as best he can, and he would treat you with respect.

relationships,f6cnphs,t3_dqtomi,1572787103.0,"First of all, this guy sounds like a jerk and I’m so sorry this happened to you.

I have two points I’d like to make.

First... Yes, it is true that people fall in love with people for their personality. Yes, it is true that we pick partners we are both physically and emotionally attracted to. And yes, it is true that we fall in love and enter relationships (and marriages) with people whom we find both physically and emotionally attracted to. More often than not, this person is not our “ideal type” physically... HOWEVER, that doesn’t bother us, because we love this person. Sometimes we have thoughts like, “I wish my wife had a smaller butt,” or “I wish my husband had a bigger penis,” but we still love these parts of them. We still love their bodies and wouldn’t trade our partner for someone with a “better” body. Yes, we can fantasize about other people while we’re in a relationship, but having an attraction to other people’s bodies doesn’t mean we like our partner’s body any less. And we don’t feel resentment toward them for not looking like our sexual fantasy. They’re our love. When we see their bodies, we feel attraction and/or arousal, we feel love, and we crave them.

NOW. My second (and more important) point... I’m gonna phrase it as an angry and dramatic question because that’s what this situation warrants. WHY THE F– DID HE TELL YOU THIS???!!! AND WHY DID HE THINK THAT POST-SEX WAS A GOOD TIME TO DO IT???!!! My GOD. Seriously, I’m angry at this guy, and as I type this I feel my heart hurting for you. How you must feel right now :/ What he did is SERIOUSLY UNCOOL. It was cruel and unnecessary. Saying something like this right after sex is just asking for trouble. Did he consider that the timing of this revelation would make it blatantly obvious that he had thought about it DURING sex??? How insulting and intentionally hurtful is that?? He had some sort of agenda. My guess is that either he was trying to hurt you for some reason, or he was trying to make you insecure and jealous so you’d somehow “change” your body. Either way, it’s NOT something a loving partner would tell you.

Again, I’m so sorry this happened to you. I try to avoid giving this next piece of advice because I think people should come to this conclusion on their own.. but honey, I truly believe you should break up with this guy. I know you probably love him, and maybe it’s been mostly good. But what he did... If you two had been in the middle of a discussion specifically about your relationship views and your sexual desires, and you ASKED HIM about his ideal type, that would be okay. If you two were friends first and you already knew his sexual preferences before getting together, that’s okay. Because you’re okay with it. I’m not saying that it’s wrong if someone’s partner is not their type. I’m saying that it’s wrong to tell them without their asking, for the sole reason that it’s unnecessary. Who does it help? What good does this information do for them? What did this guy think would come of telling you this? How could it have any positive impact? Even if you were 100% okay with it, it would still only evoke a neutral reaction. There’s absolutely no benefit. It’s unnecessary, so going out of your way to say it?? That’s cruel.

I don’t think this guy truly loves you. No one deserves to be treated like this. He embarrassed you and shamed you on purpose. He knew his comment would hurt you and he did it anyway.

You deserve better than that."
BPD,f6chmrt,t1_eypmbno,1572785713.0,"Based on your reply (and sorry for being sooooo incredibly late), I suggest you look into “imposter syndrome,” “hyper-vigilance” and “borderline personality disorder.” And don’t worry, BPD is not nearly as extreme as it sounds, it’s actually stigmatized an immense amount. It should really be called Emotional Dysregulation Disorder because that’s essentially what it is. I highly recommend a book by Shehrina Rooney called The Big Book On Borderline Personality Disorder.

I also suggest you begin seeing a therapist, psychiatrist or psychologist. Therapy can help even “mentally healthy” people. And surely if you’re feeling distressing symptoms that you’re having trouble understanding and managing, seeking help is not only helpful, it’s also the most logical response in my opinion."

“No Nut November” is an internet joke that went viral. It’s a riff on No Shave November. Officially named Movember, it’s an annual event created by the Movember Foundation, that is dedicated to raising awareness surrounding men’s health issues such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer and male suicide. They run a charity organization. The people who participate make a donation, but not only that — male participants generally let their beard grow for the entire month in the spirit of the annual month-long event (most likely to remind everyone of the significance of the month).

The No Nut November remake is a humorous twist on Movember. It’s not an actual thing. It would serve no purpose, as most men wouldn’t publicly state that they haven’t been masturbating since November 1st. And masturbation/orgasm/ejaculation isn’t specific to men anyway. Women can also abstain from orgasm for an entire month. Only a tiny fraction of women have moustaches, so few actually, that many people never see a woman with a moustache in their entire life! And more importantly, this “event” was made up by internet trolls! Not an actual organization! It’s not a nationally or internationally recognized event, it’s a stupid joke, and it’s actually surprising to me that people would take this seriously. Growing your moustache does nothing to directly benefit men in distress, but it’s a marketing hook created by a legitimate corporation to promote awareness for their charity, and it’s VISIBLE, so it has a hell of a lot more impact than an internet joke about not “nutting.”

If a guy wants to take a break from ejaculating, from sex, or from masturbation for a while, that’s his call and 100% okay — no matter the reason. But out of a feeling of moral obligation based on a stupid (and fictitious) trend? If someone is that dumb, they deserve to have one less month of pleasure in this short life. LMAO!

sex,f6byqev,t3_dqccd9,1572780123.0,"22f here. I’m so jealous! But more than that, I’m so happy for you. It sounds like you two have a wonderful and healthy, loving relationship. Clearly you love him very much, and have created a safe and compassionate environment for him, as he feels secure enough in your love and respect for him that he’ll be vulnerable with you.

I would love it if my (24m) boyfriend would let himself be vulnerable enough to try butt stuff. He loooooves anal when it’s him inside me, but he’s completely against having anything done to him (he doesn’t even like me grabbing or slapping his butt). If he’s actually not into it, that’s totally fine. But he seems to have a fear that it’s “gay” and that’s why he’s against it. It hurts me to think of him being scared to ask for something :/ Not because I feel slighted, but because I want to be someone he feels safe and comfortable with. I hope one day, maybe years into our marriage when he feels 100% accepted and secure, he’ll be able to be more vulnerable sexually and he’ll ask if we can experiment with butt play. I’ve told him from the start that I’m willing to try anything, and I’ve also told him that I like doing that kind of thing, and if he ever wants to try it, he can just let me know.

It’s completely normal to lose sexual desire a little bit as time goes on... but it’s something entirely different to lose interest because of lack of effort on the part of the other person. Yes, it’s true that it’s not your place to *decide* what she *should* wear, but it’s perfectly justified for you to ask her kindly and lovingly, if she would be willing to dress up every now and then, because you miss the way she’d make your relationship and your sex life something special. When someone stops taking care of themselves, stops caring about their appearance, stops saying please and thank you, stops doing random kind things for their partner, and things of this nature — that’s complacency. That’s when relationships weaken and sometimes even fall apart entirely. Maybe she prefers to dress more modestly these days, maybe she prefers to dress comfortably. That’s okay, but I don’t think that’s a valid reason to *never* dress up for your partner. If she shows up for your date wearing a t-shirt and jeans, that’s okay if you’re going to a casual restaurant and it’s a regular day. But if she shows up dressed casually for an anniversary dinner, that’s not cool. It’s not about the clothes!! It’s what the clothes represent — effort and excitement. It’s sending the message that you care about this date and the person you’re with.

I will never stop putting effort into my relationship. I never let myself get complacent because I look at my partner and I know in my heart that I never ever want to make him feel unappreciated, taken for granted, unloved, unattractive, unwanted, or anything of the kind. That being said, I don’t force myself to do things I don’t want to do. If he asks something of me that I don’t want to do, for example, getting him a bottle of water from upstairs. I might ask myself, “is this something I would be willing to do anyway, even though I don’t want to, cause it really wouldn’t be that hard or much of a problem, and cause I’ll be making him happy by doing this?” I might be tired, but am I tired enough to justify saying no, thus leaving my boyfriend thirsty, possibly hurting his feelings, or frustrating him (since he does stuff for me, why should I withhold favours from him?). I love my boyfriend. The thought of not getting him a bottle of water when he asks is absurd to me, I don’t even want to imagine the idea of him being thirsty even though he asked for water, knowing I’m the reason he’s suffering (even as mildly as thirst) because I love him. The thought of making life even a little bit easier for him, the warm feeling I get when I do something nice for him and take care of him in some way, the look on his face and the relief and thankfulness in his voice, seeing him drink the water and exhale in satisfaction — those are my motivations. He’s the love of my life. When he asks for something small and reasonable from me, I don’t even think about it — I do it. If I were really tired, like so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open, I would gently tell him that I’m too tired, and apologize, asking him if he can get it himself. “Sorry baby, I’m really tired. Can you get it yourself this time? I really need to sleep.” This has happened before, and he didn’t mind, because he trusts that I would do it for him if I weren’t tired. He doesn’t ask anything of me that he wouldn’t do for himself in the moment given different circumstances, or if I were to decline. He would just do it himself if I said no, he probably just figured he may as well ask me since I’m here and he could use the help. Maybe he’s had a long day at work and just feels like relaxing, so he politely asks me if I’ll get him a bottle of water. That’s what people in love do for one another. It’s give and take, and it’s taking care of one another, balancing each other out. She’s tired, so he does the dishes today. He’s stressed out, so he spends the evening watching tv or gaming rather than with her, and that’s okay, because she knows that he’d be with her if she asked him to, and that these types of nights don’t happen often.

Back to your situation. Is it the end of the world to be a little uncomfortable in a tight dress when you’re out with your boyfriend? Is it soooo hard to wear heels for a few hours, to accentuate your butt and legs so your man drools and stares at you? Why is it so hard to understand that when you love someone, you put in effort. If you care, ACT like you care. Wear lingerie every once in a while. Spice things up!!!!!! Ugh, bro, I’m frustrated on your behalf. It seems to me that you’re not just feeling sex-deprived, you’re likely feeling deprived emotionally as well, neglected even.

I really think you should talk to her about this. Not in an accusatory or angry way, just tell her how you’ve been feeling. You feel like she isn’t putting in as much effort as she used to, and it feels like she doesn’t care enough to be attractive for you. Assure her that you still love her very much, and tell her that you miss the way things were (and describe the details). If she loves you, she’ll know right away that she should step up her sexiness game, because it means strengthening the relationship and making you feel loved. All the best to you :)"

relationships,f6b8zrd,t1_f6b43bd,1572770348.0,"I have a much higher libido than him but I only look at porn when I’m planning to masturbate. He looks at pornographic content every day. He says he masturbates every two or three days. I used to initiate sex often, but being turned down too many times has caused me to initiate very rarely nowadays. I wait for him to initiate. We have sex almost every time we’re together, generally on our first day together after being apart a few days. But we usually only have sex one or two times within the span of a few days, and I want it much more often. He knows this, and he knows it frustrates me a little (and also hurts emotionally), but I respect his boundaries, and he regularly expresses his attraction for me and initiates sexual touching that doesn’t lead to sex (I do like this, but it also makes me crave and sometimes I tell him to stop if it begins to upset me since it’s not going to lead to sex). This doesn’t cause problems for our relationship, but it negatively affects me. It makes me paranoid that he isn’t attracted to me.

This is what prompted me to make this post. He knows I almost constantly want sex. He knows I’ll do anything for him. He says he’s attracted to me. He says I’m the best he’s ever had. Yet he looks at porn and beautiful, fit, sexy voluptuous women. Instead of having sex with me. Mind you, he never watches porn and never masturbates when we’re together, but I mean, why doesn’t he ask me to come over, or come to my place? And why does he scroll through his Instagram when we’re together? It’s filled with models. He says he’s also on it for the tattoo posts, men’s clothing, men’s fitness, friend’s posts, basketball highlights, etc. but it’s also filled with models and he’s on it right beside me sometimes and every once in a while he’ll “double tap” a post one of them posted. AND he knows I’m insecure about it :/ 

I have a feeling I’m just overthinking and I’m just paranoid, but it’s how I feel :/"

Clearly there is something else going on. Maybe he’s reconsidering whether he wants to be married after all, or reconsidering who he’s married to, but he certainly doesn’t believe he got married too soon or too young. When you marry someone, it’s because you are ready to spend your life with them. Yes, married people can (and often do) change their mind later on, and that’s okay — they get divorced. They married the wrong person, or, they married the right person and have changed since then, so their spouse is no longer the person they want to spend their life with.

To summarize, I believe that either your husband doesn’t want to be with you anymore, or he’s having doubts about the relationship.

I highly recommend you talk to him. Don’t be accusatory, you need to let him know that he can be open with you and that the truth is what’s needed for both of you.

Just because the boyfriend didn’t think it was a big deal, he should have at least noticed that it was a big deal to HER (the woman he claims to love???) and supported her. Supporting her doesn’t mean skipping the concert and moping on the couch all night, it means taking a few minutes empathize with her by saying things like, “wow, that sucks. I’m really sorry to hear that.” Maybe give her a long hug. And as one commenter already said, offer to talk more about it on the way to the concert. If she declines to go, he can either skip it or ask a friend to go with him. In that case, as a loving boyfriend, he tells her that she should make her night what she wants it to be (eg, “maybe you could go out with your friends/colleagues / take a relaxing bath / watch a movie, etc.”). But he DIDN’T.

He invalidated her pain and accused her of not caring about the relationship, which is in fact what HE was doing — not her. She cares about work and she also cares about their relationship, which is why she even bothered to tell him about her day in the first place. UGH.

Get out of there while you still can. If you brush this off and stay with him, shit like this will just keep happening. It won’t be long before you don’t trust yourself anymore, you’ll be living on a never-ending emotional roller coaster, you’ll lose family and friends, your self-esteem will drop to next to nothing, you’ll become severely depressed, and if you ever do escape him — it will take YEARS to recover from. It will ruin your dating life for the next decade at LEAST. To be quite honest, you may NEVER recover from this relationship if you let it go on any further.

You mentioned that he’s displayed aggressive behaviour before, and now he throws this huge tantrum and it’s the most extreme thing you’ve ever seen him do. Do you think he’s just going to go back to being mildly irritable and sometimes loses his temper? Don’t kid yourself — this will only escalate. He didn’t actually apologize for the things he did, which means he thinks his behaviour was warranted. Add in the fact that you didn’t protest very much, and cowered afterward (a prey response) — he knows that he doesn’t have to put on an act anymore. This is not to say that you acted incorrectly; your reaction was actually perfectly normal, and it proved effective since you didn’t end up escalating the situation (which could have put you in danger). HOWEVER, if you choose to continue being with this man... your passive behaviour will have fuelled an unavoidable hellfire and believe me you’ll get burnt.

schizophrenia,ey7kq9k,t3_cvz41c,1566887412.0,"Fragmented. That’s the exact word I’ve used in the past when trying to get people to understand how my memory works. It perplexes me, I don’t even know how to explain it because it’s so (seemingly) disorganized and chaotic. It’s like my timeline isn’t linear. I have very little concept of days, weeks, months and years. Times of day are actually becoming more difficult for me to remember as well, which is kinda freaking me out. My memory has been strange/troublesome for as long as I can remember. When I was young, I was forgetful (short term) and my memory was foggy but I think it was kind of linear. As time went by though, it gradually got less and less linear. It’s fragmented. That’s the best word I’ve been able to come up with. Something that feels like just a few days ago might have been weeks or months ago. More often than not, though, times that just happened seem so far in the past. I forget so easily what happened once the day is behind me. I focus on today, every day. This causes significant problems for me including missing appointments and forgetting to text and call people back. It hurts my case in arguments because I can’t trust my memory nor come up with a counter-argument to defend myself (when events are involved; for example: “when have I ever said that?” Or “give me an example of a time I did that?” Etc.). It’s so goddamn frustrating and I feel so helpless sometimes. I feel like I’m missing a vital part of my cognition.

Another huge aspect of “fragmentation” that comes to mind is the fact that I have an immense amount of trouble with seeing the “big picture.” Take learning a new card game, for instance. I try to follow along with the instructions as it’s explained before we start. I understand one sentence, and then I understand the second, but I can’t seem to put them together and see how they’re related. I barely even remember the first sentence once the second one’s been said. I can’t string the pieces together cause I keep losing the damn strings. I have a hell of a time seeing things as a whole. I can’t “sum up” very many things. I usually can’t tell you the general “theme” of anything, like the average mood I had this week, or the vibe of a specific neighbourhood, or how busy we were at work this week. I feel so broken. I feel like I’m missing something vital that is supposed to help me connect to other people, and function properly in social settings. I generally avoid learning new games when I’m at parties or family get-togethers. Cause if I do join, it’s stressful and embarrassing for me. People explain things and I just can’t for the life of me understand their explanations and instructions. I can learn and memorize it eventually if we play it a lot like maybe a few hours. But not even close to as fast as regular people can. I feel sad when I think about it, I don’t know why this is happening to me. I used to be the smartest kid in class back in elementary school. I was always called bright and a quick learner. There are many things I have committed to memory such as song lyrics and games I’m already familiar with. However, most of what I have memorized pre-dates the dramatic decline of my memory (grade 8 and earlier; it started in grade 9 and has gotten rapidly worse).

Memory issues have made me far less stressed out, that is the one good aspect. I live pretty much in the moment. I don’t let very much affect my mood cause it all goes away anyway so what’s the point? Lol, weird but true

But it’s not worth the impairment of my social skills and social life, my ability to learn, my ability to relate events and analyze patterns, formulate plans, etc. It’s not worth it. I’m actually really scared. It just gets worse and worse.

I’ve had hallucinations in the past: one visual about 8-9 years ago, one auditory around the same time, auditory about two years ago, tactile about 6 months ago. I’m scared that all these cognitive issues are a sign that I’ll soon be experiencing psychosis again (I have delusions already, though, which leads to paranoia). What if I start hearing voices and seeing things that aren’t there? What if my brain completely deteriorates? I have soooooo many different symptoms of all types, it’s unbelievable. I miss how things were 8-10 years ago, back when all I really had was depression and anxiety, and some OCD tendencies. Now I’m a fucking mess. I’m really hoping I’ll be okay..

Tl;dr I feel like my brain is fragmented because my memory timeline isn’t linear, and my cognition is too poor for me to understand things easily. I’m scared that I’m developing schizophrenia. I have all the symptoms except hallucinations (but have had them in the past). My experiences right now are heavily correlated with the “prodromal” phase of schizophrenia, and I’m scared that’s where I’m headed. I also mourn for the life that mental illness has taken from me"
relationships,ey7e60e,t1_ey7dbx9,1566879911.0,"It’s important that in a relationship, we don’t burden our partner with more than they can handle or more than what’s necessary for them to support you. For example, you can tell them about your stressful day and even get into details but they don’t need the 3-hour long play-by-play, and they don’t need a follow-up speech that’s just you ranting about the same things over and over again.

But to not talk about our stress at all? 100% unacceptable. I don’t care if he’s a “good person,” he’s not a good partner. He’s not. He stifles you, and uses you as a buffer for the stresses of life. He expects you to be all sunshine and rainbows so that you’re exclusively a source of positivity and support for him. He doesn’t value you. He probably cares very little for you. I know this is coming off as harsh, but seriously. When people show you who they are, believe them. How people act tells you everything you need to know.

*How they treat you is how they feel about you.*

Don’t try to twist it and make excuses for him. He may act sweet and polite and affectionate and whatever else.

Think about it. He doesn’t want to hear about your problems. Maybe you’ve been with him so long that you don’t notice how *actually* odd, off and messed up that is.

I haven’t heard of a connection between Seroquel and nightmares but I would suggest you bring it up at your next psych appointment. But if you’re looking for advice... in my opinion, the most important thing to attend to in your situation, is to begin trauma therapy (if you aren’t already doing so). It seems highly plausible to me that this is where your issue actually stems from — the trauma(s). The Seroquel may very well be intensifying it, but I don’t believe it’s causing the nightmares. And hey, maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe now that you’ve been given an opportunity to see your traumas more vividly, you’ll be able to heal more deeply and with more success. Memory is hard to rely on, but if it comes out in your subconscious and you can see it clearly and remember it upon waking, even though it sucks, maybe it has the potential to do wonders for you therapeutically. This is all hypothesis on my part, though. I’m not a psychiatrist and I don’t experience trauma nightmares that I can recall. I also rarely have nightmares.

CPTSD,ey7clso,t3_cvy403,1566878413.0,"Maybe you could ask her what she thinks might help? And you can use trial and error to try to see what helps and what doesn’t.

Maybe she would be willing to try to take a break from sex, maybe not. Maybe you could suggest that she be the one to initiate sex for a while, and not you — that way she might not feel as pressured. You might also benefit from taking things slowly. If she’s willing, maybe you could work your way up the ladder of intimacy (whatever that looks like for you two). For example, cuddling every night before bed for a week or two or more, and up the intensity of the acts (cuddling, kissing, and so on) incrementally at a pace that’s comfortable for her.

All that being said... if you’re looking for advice, I think the most important thing to attend to in your situation is for her to be in therapy. Having a supportive, compassionate, understanding, patient and loving partner REALLY helps. But that’s very rarely what does the real healing. We need to confront our demons and work through the tangles of our past and our pain. Maybe she’s ready for that; from what I’ve read, it sounds like she is ready.

So even though I don’t rock the boat too much with my jealousy and paranoia, I still feel it INTENSELY. It’s horrible, it feels like going insane. I feel rage and it turns more and more to panic every minute. It’s so hard to fight the urge to act on these feelings and do problematic/toxic things like blow up his phone, accuse him of cheating, accuse him of being attracted to other women more than me, shame him for looking at women online or being attracted to other women in general, act like a baby to get him to comfort me, etc. It takes practice but I’m learning to express these fears and thoughts and feelings in a constructive way. For example, explaining how I feel in reaction to something he said or did, and making sure to tell him that I know it’s not his fault and he didn’t do anything wrong, that this is just an insecurity of mine. Also, asking for reassurance rather than manipulating him into giving me reassurance. This isn’t easy, though, don’t get me wrong. It gets easier very slowly for me personally. It’s still hella hard for me to not act how I feel when these fears come up. So really the only advice I have is tips on how to not be problematic (thus driving your partner away).

I hope it goes away eventually... :( I think I kind of know how you feel and what you’re going through, and I’m sorry you have to go through this too :/ it sucks so much. All the best to you."
BPD,ey73dtq,t3_cvruas,1566870736.0,"Yep, 100% me. I’m only truly happy when I’m with my FP — my boyfriend. I feel like I’m actually talking to a person when we’re together. I feel a full range of emotions that are so powerful they overwhelm me, whether negative or positive. When I look at him, I feel so much love for him in my chest that it feels like my chest will explode any second. I feel euphoric when he’s affectionate/intimate with me (physically or otherwise). I feel optimistic about the future and content with the present. When I’m with him, I have this *zest* for *life!* I feel lively and inspired, energetic and playful, curious and engaged. With him, I have everything I need.

When we’re apart, I’m preoccupied with him on a regular (generally hourly at the very least) basis. I text him all day, except for at work. We see each other once or twice a week. I miss him when we’re apart, I look forward to seeing him, and feel happy when he reaches out to me.

I’m highly sensitive to the dynamic of our relationship — specifically, his behaviour in relation to me. I’m constantly gauging his mood and perceived level of interest in me, and his feelings and thoughts toward me. I have panic attacks if he doesn’t answer for too long of a time (generally, if it’s more than 6 hours). I feel abandoned by the smallest things that I perceive as rejection or him falling out of love with me. I get jealous very easily if he talks about other girls in any context, mentions an ex, talks about models or famous women, or even if I *think* he might be thinking about a woman. It physically hurts me to think of him being attracted to women other than me, or having been with women other than me, or spending time with women other than me (even if they’re friends). If I feel abandoned, or he’s not 100% happy with me, I panic. When he’s irritated with me, I break down. I hit the ground so fast and so hard, nothing can lift me back up except his reassurance that he still loves me, and finally, the final pull back onto my feet is him telling me he’s not mad anymore. I can’t breathe properly unless I’m in his good graces. He doesn’t manipulate me at all, I just have a HUGE issue with the thought of him feeling anything slightly negative about me.

He’s the ONLY person I miss, the only person whose opinion I care about, the only person I want to contact and spend time with. I know he’s not perfect and he can annoy me at times but I love him in his entirety. He’s my best friend.

*Theeeeeeeen* there’s other people -_- lmao. I am psychologically minded and endlessly fascinated by the human brain and mind (neurology and psychology, specifically). Despite this, I cannot not be bothered to start up a dialogue with anyone, 99% of the time. If I’m put in a social situation, I do fine — despite being uncomfortable, indifferent, bored, slightly annoyed and incredibly indifferent. It’s not that I dislike people, it’s that I have no interest in socializing. I love to read about people’s lives; their feelings and thoughts, their stories, etc. But the physical act of conversing? Ugh... it’s exhausting just to think about. I still engage with people in a friendly, polite and often humorous way, but it’s mostly an act. I don’t care about feeling connected with people; I don’t want to share inside jokes, I don’t want to build trust or hold their secrets or give them mine, I don’t want to make plans, touch each other’s arms, go out for activities and the like. I see conversation as a task. An obstacle. Something done merely out of convenience, if that person is someone with whom I’d prefer to be on good terms with (which is in my best interest), then I’ll make the sacrifice and go through the motions of the human social rituals. By the way, I’m also extremely touch-averse. I HATE anyone touching me except for my boyfriend. I literally cringe and it bothers me a LOT if I’m touched. I won’t even let me family touch me. But with my boyfriend, I can’t get enough. His touch is euphoric, his skin is soft and his body is sturdy; his body is the closest thing to Heaven that I’ve ever known. I feel safe when I can feel him, even if it’s just our feet touching as we drift off to sleep. Even just his presence soothes me.

I don’t get excited about anything besides him. I don’t really have the motivation to do anything that doesn’t include him. I’ve had depression my entire life, so for more than two decades now. My mental health seems to get worse every year. I can barely function. I work part-time making minimum wage in a dead-end retail job because I don’t have the energy to work more hours, nor the cognitive ability to go to post-secondary to aim at a career. I don’t have friends because I choose not to. I don’t have many hobbies anymore because my mental health has been deteriorating. I’m tired and sore all the time. I’m often suicidal, as life is just so painful and heavy for me. But when I’m with him, none of that matters. I make myself keep it together until the next time I see him, and try to enjoy my solitude to the best of my ability. I can handle our time apart, as I usually looooove my alone time. I do get depressed on and off when we’re apart and even when I’m with him but that’s the way I’ve always been and it will never change. He’s the only thing that has managed to bring a lasting light into my life and into my heart. He gives me hope. He makes me love life. Just the act of loving him motivates me to be more, so that I can reciprocate his efforts and his affections, and take care of him, and be his best friend, and be as healthy mentally and physically as I can be. My main goal in life is to be his partner. I don’t care about much else. I still love my alone time, and I love psychology. I will always read books, watch videos, take courses, join groups, research, talk in groups such as this subreddit. Anything that’s related to psychology, psychiatry, science such as neurology, biology, etc. sociology, and even philosophy (which I used to be into a lot more but have since lost much interest). I will always love being out in nature, and drinking tea, and taking baths, etc. Those are small pleasures, and I’m grateful for them. But they take up very little real estate in my heart and mind. I’m indifferent to most people and things, I’m only mildly interested in a few things, I’m passionate about one or two things, and I’m fully, 100% invested in my boyfriend and our relationship. It’s like polar opposites. Hot with him, cold with everything else.

And before anyone even says it, I am fully aware of what codependency is. I studied it for nearly 7 years. I don’t care that this resembles codependency. This is me and it works for me, and for my boyfriend. I’m not hurting anyone, I’m not suffocating my partner nor manipulating him, I’m not shunning my family or turning a blind eye to injustice when I see it. I simply stay in my lane significantly more than the average person, and suffer from debilitating depression which nearly only lightens when I’m with my boyfriend — my best friend and the man I’m going to marry. I still mourn for the life I can’t live, and everything my mental illnesses took from me, but I’m doing what I can with what I have, and I refuse to take for granted the joy that my love has brought me, and I refuse to deny myself of what makes my heart sing and gives me life. I refuse to be toxic to my boyfriend, so boundaries are a priority. Our relationship is balanced, respectful, loving, honest, fulfilling, fun, safe. It’s not dysfunctional. It’s not a codependent relationship. I just happen to have BPD, and I don’t let it impact our relationship.

Tl;dr I have had depression for over two decades. Not much interests me except my boyfriend. I have bpd, yet I’m in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in, and literally the healthiest I’ve even seen — ever. I don’t miss anyone but my boyfriend, I’m not attached to anyone but him, he’s the only one I’m excited to see, the only one I want to talk to. His existence and our relationship inspires me to be the best I can be."

BPD,ey4n9sn,t1_ey3w3l0,1566798632.0,True!
BPD,ey4n98y,t3_cvf14i,1566798613.0,"I think it’s possible that you have BPD, and that you should seek a psychiatrist who could administer diagnostic tests.

I would like to point out something I noticed. At first, you mentioned that you don’t feel emotions intensely. Then, you went on to say that you feel very angry sometimes, and so upset over things that you cry, and feel intense happiness as a result of spending time with people, etc.

My friend, you feel emotions strongly, lol. Maybe not as strongly as people with BPD (if you don’t have it) but certainly more so than sociopaths or people who are truly numb/unfeeling. Perhaps you mean, you experience chronic emptiness and/or apathy and/ or lethargy?

As someone else mentioned, one of the symptoms people with  BPD experience, in addition to frequent mood swings and strong emotions, is chronic emptiness. Emptiness, at least to me, is not quite the same as being unfeeling and here’s why I think that: emptiness can mean lack of motivation, inspiration, purpose or meaning. Emptiness can mean boredom, lack of connection with people, and dissociation (a maladaptive coping mechanism for dealing with undesired emotions such as those which are triggered due to trauma).

Here’s how this theory plays out in my life. I’m lethargic nearly all the time. Not much interests me. I have a couple hobbies but I rarely do them. I don’t have big goals, I don’t get excited about things, I don’t have attachments to anyone except my boyfriend who is also my fp (I have BPD). I dissociate often, I struggle with emotional impermanence (essentially: out of sight, out of mind; meaning once it’s gone, I detach emotionally and mentally). I find most tasks tedious and exhausting even to think about. I am mostly unfeeling.

Now technically, rapid mood swings are not actually a symptom of bpd, it just happens to be a symptom that some/many people with BPD experience in addition to their disorder (they’re highly correlated). I cycle between “okay and somewhat optimistic” and “depressed and hopeless, often suicidal as well.” HOWEVER. When it comes to things that I actually *do* care about (so basically mostly my boyfriend) I’m highly sensitive. I feel euphoric when I’m with my boyfriend. I get excited when I know I’m going to see him. I miss him terribly when we’re apart. When I look at him, I feel like my chest is going to explode from too much love inside. When he’s annoyed by something I did, I’m devastated and feel horribly guilty and ashamed. When he’s angry about something I did.... I have a full-blown episode. “Frantic efforts to avoid real or perceived abandonment.” — DSM-5. I get a panic attack, paranoid, terrified that he doesn’t love me anymore and that he’s going to leave. I drive myself crazy thinking about all the horrible things he might be thinking about me (which he doesn’t have, ever). Luckily, my boyfriend understands my disorder, because he listened to me when I told him about it, and committed to learning about the disorder and me, learning my triggers and what helps me calm down, etc.

Anyway, point is — people with BPD, generally, feel empty most of the time, until they’re triggered (usually in a social situation) which results in emotions which are felt with great intensity.

Again, I see a strong connection between your description of yourself and the symptoms of BPD. If you wanna talk, I’m here. I hope you seek out someone to talk to about it, specifically a trained professional. All the best to you!

Tl;dr: chronic emptiness is not the same thing as being unfeeling. Both chronic emptiness and “feeling emotions intensely” can co-exist within a person with borderline personality disorder."
relationships,ey4lb4s,t3_cvenx9,1566796447.0,"Maybe *she’s* cheating.... was my initial thought. Or perhaps — and this seems more likely — she’s been cheated on in the past and flipped out. Maybe she has abandonment issues or has BPD. Either way, her behaviour was pretty fucked up to be honest.

I myself struggle with paranoia, jealousy and abandonment issues (BPD here) but I don’t let those insecurities drive me to abuse my boyfriend. I calmly explain to him that I know logically he wouldn’t cheat on me and that I trust him, that it’s just a (possibly irrational) fear of mine and that I was triggered by what happened. And that I want him to know about it and about how I feel. It’s not your fault, etc. Then maybe offer some way he can make it easier for me in the future when he goes out again. And sometimes I’ll ask him to affirm to me that he loves me and why, and that he chooses to be with me, and that he doesn’t want anyone but me. People with insecurities like this usually need affirmations from their partner, ya know, reminders that they have nothing to worry about.

BUT I HIGHLY SUGGEST that you talk to her about how her behaviour was inappropriate, uncalled for, AND abusive (I don’t care what the other comments said, even if this happened only once, it was definitely abuse. You don’t treat people like this, especially people you claim to love). She can’t be blowing up like this and talking to you the way she did. It’s not okay. If she doesn’t see that after you talk to her, I suggest you just leave, bro. Seriously.. There are people out there who act responsibly and are mindful about their behaviour and effect on others, and who will love you like you deserve, like anyone deserves. All the best to you."
schizophrenia,ey42rel,t3_cv5jmv,1566780246.0,"For me, it’s about lack of energy, and feeling like I just physically can’t do it, even if I really really want to.

I feel the entire range of emotions with him, whether we’re together or apart. But with everybody else, I’m extremely apathetic. I used to have SUPER high empathy but it just kinda went away this year. Maybe it’s the medications I started taking, who knows. It’s also because I’ve trained myself to be less emotionally reactive and less dependent on outside validation. Sometimes I miss having high empathy because at least then I felt connected. The pain felt holy. But now I don’t even have patience to wait for an old person to get on the bus. I get angry and wish they were dead. It’s like I’m a completely different person in that sense, because the old me that everyone thinks is still me, was nearly infinitely patient and compassionate. I have nearly no compassion left, except for myself and my boyfriend. I kinda like it better this way though. Caring less makes life less painful.

I loooooove being in the shower once I get in there but if I’m not in the shower, the thought of showering is tiring as hell even just to think about. The process of standing up, getting a towel, walking to the bathroom, undressing, turning on the shower, getting in. Ughhhhhhhh so tedious. Most of the time I can’t even bring myself to do it even if I actually *want* to shower. Sometimes it feels like I’m begging myself, “pleeeeease just shower, it’s not that hard. I really want to wash my hair, and I would really like to go to sleep feeling fresh and clean” but bro it’s actually so hard for some reason. I look around and see people achieving all these wildly impressive things yet I can’t even do the bare minimum.

BPD,ey1sbl4,t3_cux9k2,1566709363.0,"While reading, I kept reading for tell-tale signs that you might actually be losing your touch with reality. First of all, holy shit. I’m SO sorry for how your life has been thus far. You were dealt so many shitty cards it’s a miracle you turned out so different from your family. I bet your brain has felt really chaotic and you feel like you’re not normal anymore.. I totally get that. I do feel that there is a silver lining, though I’m not minimizing your experience or pain in any way. It doesn’t seem to me that you’re actually losing your mind or “going crazy.” Your reactions and beliefs that resulted from your experiences are highly proportional and logical. The way you were treated shaped the way you began to view yourself and the world. Beliefs are a self-fulfilling prophecy, meaning, they tend to exacerbate every feeling or inkling you have, every symptom, and they tend to reinforce themselves each time you’re faced with a situation that “proves” the validity of your belief (this is called confirmation bias). It seems to me that what you’re experiencing is severe depression, and dissociative symptoms (due to trauma). I would say that every symptom you’ve described is a perfectly reasonable human reaction to the things you’ve gone through. “Going crazy” requires that you react inappropriately to your situation. Psychosis is a break from reality, whether it be a hallucination or a delusion. I see nothing out of the ordinary with how your brain has processed your experiences. It’s damn near impossible to have a healthy life when all you’ve known is dysfunction and pain. It’s hard to have healthy self-esteem when your core developmental influencers told you how horrible you are (both explicitly with words and implicitly through their actions). The silver lining of this is: depression and faulty/negative beliefs and mental habits are HIGHLY malleable, meaning that with therapy, you could possibly FULLY recover from your current cognitive issues, but for certain, with therapy, you’ll get to a place where you’re pretty happy and stable. Psychotic disorders are much more complicated in the sense that there aren’t really any logical solutions. It actually *is* “going crazy,” whereas depression merely *feels* like going crazy since it’s so disorienting, debilitating, and most notably: chaotic. Having frenzied thoughts and severe anxiety feels like losing control. It is losing control, but it’s not losing touch with reality in any permanent sense. Dm me if you want. All the best!"
BPD,ey1r6sl,t3_cv2rjb,1566708226.0,"It seems to me that she has a very extreme case of both BPD and C-PTSD. Her life has been extremely traumatic and she is hell-bent on constantly recreating and reliving her traumas in the present. She may need to suffer significantly to realize she needs help. It seems to me that even though she’s been in crisis so long, she managed to skate by fairly smoothly since she’s being supported by you financially. Once she falls on her face as a result of her incredibly problematic behaviour/habits, she’ll either wake up and seek help, or she’ll crash and burn. I really do believe that some people have been hurt too deeply and conditioned too horrifically to come back and be stable people. It’s sad but, that’s life. She is not your responsibility. And you only have this one life!! Don’t you think you deserve to be with someone who truly loves you? Rather than someone who is attached to you simply because you play an important role in keeping her in her cycle of dysfunction.. someone who she can project her past onto in order to recreate her childhood?? I hope you choose your sanity over your loyalty to — quite frankly — enabling her. She may get better one day, and maybe you can rekindle. But right now, in my opinion, you’re not doing yourself — or her — any favours by being in a relationship with her. I suggest researching codependency, especially the work of Melody Beattie.

I’m truly very sorry you’re going through this... I’ve gone through similar (but far less extreme) situations, and I know it’s hard to leave people we care about even though it’s in our best interest and theirs, sometimes especially because we don’t want them to suffer. But what helped me was, realizing that I would actually be hurting them more by staying. Even if they end up dying as a result. Because had you not left them, they wouldn’t have even had a chance to get better. Enabling is not helping. It eases our guilt but it doesn’t actually help the person we want to help. I hope some of this was helpful. All the best to you."
schizophrenia,ey1pea2,t3_cv1z34,1566706488.0,"First of all, I’m not a psychiatrist, but I experience psychosis, and I take Seroquel. It seems plausible to me that one of the symptoms of withdrawal from an antipsychotic could trigger psychosis. However, I don’t know for sure if this is true. I would say though, it seems to me that you might be experiencing psychosis and I highly recommend you talk to a professional, even if the symptoms go away when you begin taking your Seroquel again.

To gain some clarity on your situation, are you taking Seroquel because you’re diagnosed with a psychotic disorder? I assume yes, because you’re posting in the schizophrenia subreddit.. but, the reason I’m asking is, 100 mg is really low for treating someone who experiences psychosis (especially hallucinations). To my knowledge, the appropriate dose is at least 300 mg for schizo-spectrum disorders, psychotic disorders, and disorders with psychotic features. Low doses of Seroquel are generally associated with anxiety, impulse control, agitation and BPD. Were you experiencing any symptoms of psychosis while you were taking Seroquel continuously? Did you experience psychosis prior to starting the medication? I know these are personal questions haha, I’m just asking them in an attempt to stimulate your brainstorming about your issue. Perhaps you could discuss with your psychiatrist the possibility of raising your dose. All the best!"

He answered your question with a completely unrelated response. More quality time as a couple = zero time with family????? I don’t think so??? He totally projected onto you.

It sounds like he’s either A) using his family as an excuse to spend less time with you, B) his family accused him of choosing you over them, or C) he’s seriously dumb. If you don’t feel that this is a deal-breaker, I would suggest talking to him about it. Approach from a non-accusatory stance (affirm that you love him/ask open-ended questions rather than interrogate/ask about how he’s feeling/etc.). The point is not to call him out for acting like a baby (he is), the point is to see if there’s an underlying reason. Once he fesses up, then you can call him out for being illogical and acting like a baby lmao. HOWEVER, it’s possible he reacted this way because a previous girlfriend asked him to choose between her and his family. No matter the reason, the truth remains that he doesn’t seem to value your relationship very much, since he isn’t interested in quality time, and more importantly, your needs and wants are not important to him. He literally got offended when you shared your feelings with him and made a reasonable request in order to INCREASE INTIMACY. He sounds uncaring and cold, selfish and immature.

I agree with one of the comments about how you might benefit from improving your communication skills, however, I think it’s your husband who’s in the wrong here. My initial reaction is that there’s something going on with him that he hasn’t told you. Maybe it’s work stress, and that’s why he’s using video games to distract. To be fair, I’m a fairly paranoid person so I might be way off. For example, if this happened to me, I’d be worried that he’s cheating on me and that he’s too guilty to celebrate an anniversary with me because anniversaries represent commitment. That would be my first thought. It’s far less likely, though, than say, he’s just stressed, or just a shitty partner. The way he treats you is unacceptable (ignoring you when he’s talking to his online friends, not making an effort to go out on your anniversary even just for a drink or a walk, or making love, anything!!!). He’s acting like a dick, and he owes you an apology. If it were me, I’d attempt to talk to him about this. Take a non-aggressive, non-accusatory stance, and see if he’s stressed out about something that’s causing him to use video games as distraction. That’s where I’d start. Then once that’s out, let him know how his behaviour made you feel, and let him know that anniversaries are special to you and you’d like if you could do something - even something small together.

BPD,ey05mqm,t3_cutbq1,1566674741.0,"Yes, 100% I’ve been with my SO for almost two years. About a year ago, I decided to stop initiating because I couldn’t handle the rejection. It would trigger an episode every single time. I’d feel abandoned and start freaking out thinking he doesn’t love me or finds me repulsive. Or that he’s mad at me. Now I don’t feel rejected nearly as often, and I feel like I’m being pursued. This works for my partner and I because I have a significantly higher sex drive than he does and he is nearly 0% insecure, so he doesn’t mind at all that I’m not pursuing him sexually. And he doesn’t mind that we don’t have sex often. I’ll still do things to try to seduce him passive-aggressively haha like the way I dress in private with him and stuff like that. I’ll *suggest* haha. I don’t blatantly ask anymore or initiate physically. Yes, I’m a little disappointed that we don’t have as much sex as I’d like, but I understand that I don’t just have a high sex drive — I’m a sex addict AND hyper-sexual. I have to keep in mind that it’s not his fault I feel sex-deprived, it’s my mental illnesses that cause that feeling. My partner and I have a very healthy relationship, despite my multiple diagnoses — including BPD (which is an accomplishment on its own tbh, bpd creates chaos)."
