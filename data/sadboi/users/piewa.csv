The Nines is a go to drink for younger people because its quite cheap, high in alcohol and delicious. Also now there is 4 kind of it and theres a different special edition each year.

Tastes:
Original - taste of anise, pepper, ginger, muscat. 
Green Nines - anise, vanilla, citrus and coffee. 
Red Nines - oranges and other citrus fruits with cinammon (best drink ever for me personally, you can make so many cocktails out of it and its really sweet so easy to drink it on its own and its usually the only flavour I find in baltic shops abroad). 
Last years edition - sea buckthorn flavour.

It doesn't matter if you take them together or you have lets say 12hours between these two medications, the outcome is still the same.

Edit: also if it's really non-stop 48h without sleep, you have severe sleep deprivation now, you should not only feel migraine but also nausea, chills and dehydration, and soon you'll start to get hallucinations. Go to ER, explain the situation, get the medication for the sleep, after that immediately either start taking antidepressants in the morning(over the whole day the effect will lower and you'll be able to fall asleep better) or ask your GP to lower the dose/change the medication completely.

- you're earning that much money cuz you got lucky and got hired fast and you're already finished college, whereas she is young, just taking classes and will take time to get to the same income level like you
- when you study all you can do is work part time most of the time and of course those jobs dont pay much
- you have been living together, even if not for a long time - people who live together share their incomes, plan what they're buying together, etc. Yes, usually, the income difference is not so big, but its normal for people sooner or later while living together to do that, because living together usually leads to getting married or breaking-up. 

So I would say you guys need to think where this relationship is going. If you havent had any thoughts of marrying her or she has no thoughts on getting a proper job when she finishes college - then you'll know you dont want to share your income, but then you also shouldnt both buy anything together in the apartament also, cuz thats going to be hard to separate later when you break-up. If you have those thoughts/she seems determined to be successfull like you - you share the income BUT not all of it, ask her to pay something and make a plan for her to get more involved into taxes and stuff (so you both would pay half of those things) and create spending budget for both of you on other stuff (clothes, activities, etc).

There's a huge cultural difference - I have some friends from Portugal and they absolutely hate it here, bc brits are really loud and shallow, they like to just go to clubs and pubs and get wasted every day - so if you dont wanna do that all the time, there's really not much to do in Portsmouth. No proper galleries, museums (just two - about war and boats), shopping malls (there are several places where there are clusters of shops, but the biggest international brand you'll find is H&M, everything else is british) or really any other activities in the city. I thought I would at least travel - but the tickets to everything besides London, Brighton and Southampton (there all like an hour away) are really expensive. It will be also hard to find a job in the first semester - you'll need to get a national insurance number to be able to work, so until you get it (which took me 3 months and im from EU), no one will properly hire you.

When you'll finally get a job its good - working part time(20-25h) you can earn around 800£ a month, which will cover a lot and youll still be left with some. Just a tip - they ask for a whole year (or a semester) in advance for halls/studios - which means you'll need to have like at least 3000£ when you come. Prices are way higher then what you have in Portugal by the way. 

But there are of course pros - the uni and the seaviews. Uni is the best. All the study programs are really good, lots of opportunities, so if you are motivated and career orientated - you'll get a lot from it. There are lots of societies, so if you get involved into them - you'll have the best time here.

I might sound a bit harsh, but I'm just saying like it is for me and my friends. I wish I knew all of this stuff before I came here - would have chosen other uni's I got into and went to Nottingham, Manchester or even London.

The driver was in his 30s and did not understand russian, asked people on the bus to translate it for him. Another old lady asked that woman why is she speaking russian in the first place, because she heard that some of the words were not correctly said. That woman replied that she grew up in soviet times and later never wanted to learn lithuanian, even though she is lithuanian. And well, since a lot of people understand russian, just dont speak in it - people got angry and started shamming that woman, how she, now in her 80s, never learned lithuanian, how she can choose soviet times over her own nationality and she got so ashamed that she had to get off the bus immediately. 

I agree that this situation could've been handled better, but can't say that I dont agree with what people said also. Situations like these now occur more and more, it causes russians to live in certain areas in the city more than everywhere else and from my personal experience in school, for example, they usually stayed together and a lot of people looked down on them. 

Lithuanians want to become more scandinavian now (especially when we already have a lot of the same things), and never to be associated with russians again, and that sometimes means not even speaking the language that they learned."

When I'm down my dog starts to neglect my bf and she follows only me around, sleeps near me and gives cuddles only to me. It might be also because my dog grew up with me, so she has been there through all the abuse I endured and she used to protect me from it all the best she could (she's a small dog, but still)."
