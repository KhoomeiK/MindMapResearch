poetry_critics,fpemizv,t3_gci2q6,1588550431.0,"Hi again!

This one is really good! I like how the title is ""Hope"" but the poem itself is seemingly bleak; or perhaps this person hopes they are alone? Perhaps it is a symbol of being hopeful in oneself despite the odds or despite feeling alone. I think there are many ways to interpret the meaning and that is exactly what we want as poets. I would change the grammar and punctuation a bit; you do not need to end each line with a period. Each line is not equal to a sentence, so it does not require a period. If you struggle with that, then a tip is to remove line breaks (so your poem becomes a paragraph) and punctuate as if you were reading it in that format. Put the punctuation where you would if it were a block of text and then make the line breaks.

For example your poem would become:
As the final embers of light flicker above me. And the whisper of sun dissipates into black smoke. I wonder. Am i as alone as the lone star above me.

If you read it like that ^ it feels a bit choppy due to the sentence fragments.

Now this doesn't always work perfectly due to the strategic ways to implement the line breaks, but it should get you started.  

""Am I alone as the lone star above me?"" (Firstly it needs a question mark). This feels redundant. ""Alone as the lone..."". You could get rid of the word ""lone"" completely.

If you wonder if ""[you're] as alone as the star(s) above me"" the reader will know that the star(s) is/are, well, alone. Why would someone say ""as alone as [something not alone]""?

This one is already really good. I'd say it's quite an improvement on the last one of your I reviewed. You really nailed the ability to leave things open to the reader's interpretation in this one, which can be very difficult sometimes. The only ""errors"" are grammar/punctuation.

I know this seems long but I was trying to explain how to figure out punctuation easier, which you can use for the rest of your life! Hope my text wall didn't scare you off ;)"

poetry_critics,fpbm9ln,t3_gcdjbj,1588473297.0,"For a first try at fantastical poetry, this is quite well done. I do, however, have a few suggestions for you:
- The first 2 lines? Good. Minimalism in a good way. A little cliché but it works well. I like it. 
- The next bit was confusing. Sky is beneath her but rivers are above her? In context I think of drowning but if that's the case I would not use the verb ""run"". Perhaps ""escape"" or ""be free"" or even ""know/understand""
- The last two lines have a lot of potential. Maybe she's dead but doesn't know it. Maybe she's talking to a personified ""death"". Maybe she's making a pact with the devil. Maybe she IS the devil.
- I honestly thought the ""Thanks"" at the end was a part of the poem. It's formatted exactly the same.

Overall, good go! I think the best advice for you is to involve more of the senses. This type of fantastical/mystery/supernatural poetry really benefits from having more than just base descriptions. 

""She disappeared like a whisper in the night"" --> sound and metaphor
Midnight blue --> colour/imagery. Juxtaposing more intense description with shorter snippets is good as long as it doesn't make the format clunky.

Again, quite well done! Room to improve? Yes. We all have room to improve, always. Keep working! I hope to see more from you."

Alcohol? Best case scenario you'd get intoxicated worst case scenario alcohol poisoning and liver failure.

Bleach? It would degrade your cells. It would literally eat away at your insides.

Drain cleaner? It would be like bleach but faster and stronger. It's not the same substance ofc. It's sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Also your chance to survive w/o medical assistance is *drastically* lower. 

Here's a video that shows solid sodium hydroxide (""lye"") being mixed with water with a thermometer showing the increase in temperature. Imagine THAT in your bloodstream,  as your cells would be constantly pushing water out to dilute.


https://youtu.be/E6Dlf47sLuU

In some cases, an amount could be survived naturally because your cells would shrivel up and release all the water inside of them in an attempt to dilute the substance. This is NOT healthy and if the substance used reacts with water (i.e drain cleaner) you're gonna have a bad time.
