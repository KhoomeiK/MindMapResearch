lgbt,fqyzn71,t3_glhc77,1589757307.0,"Yeah, it really is this easy. ‘Mum, who is that man with Uncle Eric?’.  ‘That’s his boyfriend’. ‘Oh, ok’. 

And we have a dear friend whose young person is being supported to transition their gender (with professional help and always letting the young person take the lead). That conversation was a little longer. ‘Mum, [she] says she is a girl now and wants me to call her Francis’. ‘Yeah, she felt uncomfortable as a boy and wants to be a girl now’.  ‘Oh, like dress ups?’. ‘Not really, but clothes are part of it. She wants to try living as a girl for now to see if it works for her. If she likes it, she will probably want to stay that way.’  ‘Oh, ok. Is she wearing dresses so people know she is a girl?’.  ‘I think it maybe helps, yeah’.  ‘Ok’. 

That’s it. He (and his friend) are 8. That was all the detail he needed for either conversation. It was in no way uncomfortable."

Many small town Showgrounds a have decent facilities for not much $$ per night too. These can be your friend.

AskAnAustralian,fqywpjg,t3_gllgi7,1589755857.0,"My family have spent the last few years taking all our holidays in Australia. We avoid the large freeways and big cities in favour of smaller places. We get off the beaten track to explore the small towns and quirky little spots that are in abundance if you look. We stay at rural pubs and little motels or caravan parks. 

We go to the tourist information centre in each small town or village and see what they have to offer. Each time we have found an array of cool stuff that you won’t easily find online. And local souvenirs and know that can’t be beaten. 

If you do this, and steer clear of outback travel (which requires additional preparation) you will find gems wherever you go. 

Visitors often find that the distances between places here are larger than they expect. If biking, I would recommend exploring Victoria as it is a state with a lot packed into a smaller space than many other parts of Australia. Or explore a small part of another state: the Atherton Tableland in North Queensland or Northern Rivers in NSW as a couple of examples. 

There is not ‘nothing’ between Sydney and Perth. But there are some parts where there is a lot of ‘nothing’ for many kilometres. Crossing the Nullarbor is not a beginner exercise. I would recommend staring small and getting local knowledge as much as you can."

simpleliving,fqwo030,t1_fqwdmfh,1589711546.0,"We recognised a coming financial storm and immediately pulled everything back to essential spending only. We run three bank accounts: daily expenses, bill paying and rainy day (that last one is an emergency fund only for dire need). We reduced our daily expenses to bare minimum and the rest is being funnelled to the rainy day account.  Any spending other than essentials, we discuss and decide if it is needed and if there is an alternative to spending money on the problem. 

We looked at how we could reduce shopping trips and maximise savings. This means planning. We make meals plans and shopping lists and stick to them. We go out twice per week only and fit all our work and shopping and health needs into one day as much as possible. We are teaching our kids to cook good meals from scratch - it is cheaper and a skill that saves a lot of money over a lifetime. Tonight my young fellow made cheeseburgers as good as any take away. Our plan is to ruin every kind of takeaway meal by making it better at home. Cooking is connection time which is super important for everyone at the moment. 

I grow a few things in the garden but prefer to shop local for our grocery needs, supporting small business where I can and buying in bulk where possible. A fiend has formed a bulk buying cooperative so we can save even more. Meal planning makes this sustainable - we can anticipate our needs better. 

We work from home and have for several years. This reduces our needs for car use and we can get by with one car even though we have little access to public transport here. More recently we arranged our client interaction to minimise trips and it seems that we won’t need to go back to the frequency of face to face meetings we once had. 

We decided, now our restrictions have eased to keep our social outings to a maximum of once per week each. At the moment it is less than that and we are enjoying it. When the pressure to do more increases we will discuss need first before bowing to outside pressure. We are connecting more regularly with family (who are all over) than before and finding that we want to keep that connection. At the moment, we have a regular weekly session in a zoom type meeting that family and close friends can drop into as fits them. This is actually better than it was. 

We scheduled fun into the week and stick to it. This was a bit haphazard before. Walks, outside time, board game nights, movie nights all have a special time in the week so they aren’t forgotten.  We also have habitat time which is where we all get together to improve our habitat by cleaning, decluttering, maintaining, etc. The load is shared better and scheduling means we don’t neglect to do it. A liveable space is important for all of us. 

We looked at what we could drop from our lives completely - the things we don’t miss from before. That was a lot. And assumptions were made by us parents for kids that turned out to be false. The kids do not miss scheduled sports - they prefer family walks. They do not miss school and are learning more than ever at home with little adult intervention. It’s like we took our hands off the wheel and they took charge of their own education. It was transformative! They would like to connect with friends in person but can’t do much of that right now so online is a good alternative. 

Finally, we adults asked what our eight year old selves loved to do. We came back to simple joys - drawing and board games, music, reading and fun movement.  It feels great to let everything else fall away."
simpleliving,fqwagyr,t3_glagy7,1589697684.0,"We pulled ourselves from the rat race about ten years ago, foregoing higher income for a better lifestyle in a semi rural area. The pandemic has slowed us down even more - we are making fewer car trips, saving more money, really prioritising what social things are important (we are currently allowed to have one household visit another). We have de-cluttered further which is a great way to consider wasteful past spending. The kids are happy connecting with friends online and learning at home without the morning rush. 

We have already starting talking about the changes we would like to make sure we keep up and we have adjusted a few things to make sure the changes can be sustained in the long term. 

My secret hope is that enough people will realise slowing down is good for you that they too will make sustainable changes for the better."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fqvnen7,t3_gl2jmd,1589680962.0,"If you can, ask around for a decent hairdresser in your area. It might take a few tries to find one you can really trust but for me there is nothing that beats a new haircut feeling. I also have low maintenance colour done about every six months.  The man who cuts my hair is lovely - he plays great music, gives a good massage when washing my hair and he makes a really good coffee while I’m waiting for the colour to process. I always feel great coming out of the salon. 

The other thing I love is getting my eyebrows professionally shaped about every six months. I pluck them in between to keep the shape but it is worth the splurge to get someone who can see my whole face at once to do them. 

And, in summer, I get a pedicure and gel nails done on my toes. I’ve never been able to keep a manicure nice but toes seem to last. I love looking down at sparkly toes. 

Whatever you do, make sure it is for you. I hate shaving or waxing most of my body but I love smooth legs and shaped eyebrows. I don’t like makeup at all. But I love a nice dress and funky but comfortable shoes. You do you, not what is expected by marketing and culture."

Sure it’s awkward to play with all that laminating but you never need to worry about spills or tears.

AskAnAustralian,fpx30hl,t3_gfwiz7,1588974706.0,"100%. Most people will inform themselves at least enough to pick their ‘favourite team’. In recent years, websites like Vote Compass have made it easy for individuals to pick which issues are important and determine who best to vote for based on that. 

Because it is mandatory, you can vote by post or in person well beforehand if you think you won’t be around on the day itself. Elections are held on Saturdays to allow the most people to attend and there are many, many places you can vote in a given area which avoids long queues and waiting times. Plus it becomes a fundraiser for the local schools - they have stalls after voting where you can buy a sausage sizzle or homemade cakes. 

The voting is done by paper and pencil and counted by hand with scrutineers from all parties and from the electoral commission standing by to ensure fairness. It is a good system. A small percentage will complain but our voter turnout is high and the donkey votes are small. 

The only issues I have with it is that a handful of billionaires who have too much media influence can swing an election their way by throwing money at it. And that we do not spend nearly enough time teaching people how our system works and how to be better at informing themselves how to engage with it. Both problems would be easy to fix, with some political gumption. 

So yeah, I’m 100% for mandatory voting and cannot understand how democracy can be claimed without it."

We are all doing the best we can with the tools we have. None of us does any of this perfectly and we all have bad days. Try to be gentle with yourself, especially at this time where everything is happening so differently to normal. 

On my bad parent days I try (after the little ones are asleep) to work out not how I should have done things differently but rather how I felt and what I needed in the ‘bad’ moments. 

For example, when quarantine started I missed the deep connection of face to face contact with friends. I felt empty. I needed that connection to fill my emotional cup before I could connect with my children. This flowed on to having some bad parent moments. I have made a point of connecting with friends when I can using video chat. It isn’t as good but it gets me through. 

Another friend is isolated in a rural place with poor internet and three children. She determined that she needed time in her day for peace. She had a special table and a book. She makes tea and for the time she is sitting there, the kids can’t disturb her unless there is an genuine emergency. This is working for her. 

What are you feeling? What are you needing in those moments where you feel your parenting is lacking? Is there a way to help yourself or get help? 

And if you can, take some time at the end of the day to just reflect on the good things you did as a parent today. I ask my child what was good about the day and what he would like to do tomorrow. Then in the morning over breakfast we make a short list of two or three things he wants to do and a few things I want to do. We then try to focus on those things."

She replied that as a model it was her job to draw attention to her best parts, not focus on what others would see as flaws."

dehydrating,fmz9c3l,t3_fy74vs,1586511543.0,"The power use of a large unit and a small unit is similar. You can always put fewer trays in but having more trays to fill gives you more versatility.  

I went from 5 trays to 9 trays and can now put jars of yoghurt in there or prove bread dough. And I can do so many zucchini chips at once!

I have an Excalibur with the plastic trays. I haven’t tried stainless. Either way, get some silicon sheets so you can dehydrate things that are more  runny, like fruit leathers."

australia,fmqfpz3,t1_fmqexbo,1586298738.0,Agreed. And I think part of the solution is a well thought out universal basic income - to not let anyone be left behind.

australia,fmqdnjg,t1_fmqaj0j,1586297648.0,I think you are right. I think this is on a whole different scale than the GFC - and that took years to bounce back from for many businesses.

Showerthoughts,fmcrazr,t3_fuadwo,1585951260.0,"All summer (Dec, Jan, Feb) Australians were fighting bushfires all over the map. It became very common to end conversations with ‘stay safe’. Some have switched to ‘stay healthy’ but many are sticking with ‘stay safe’. Fortunately we have switched from a situation where staying home could be dangerous (for some, depending on where you live)  to staying home being the safest place. I prefer the latter. And I’m grateful the rain came before the pandemic."

AskFeminists,fm3xdcu,t3_fsxnyt,1585740395.0,"At 16 I had half formed ideals based on a world view limited by my experiences. I thought I was many things but didn’t feel comfortable with any particular label. Lots of reading, listening to the stories of people who are different to me and trying to understand what lead us to here (history) helped me to fully form my ideals. It takes time and effort though and you have just begun a lifetimes work. 

A wise friend taught me a useful and practical trick. Whatever position you hold on an issue, try and walk right around to the other side - 180 degrees opposite to your original position. Try to understand this new position from the side of those who hold it. Ask questions until you understand. Then look back at your original position. You will either agree with it, disagree with it or be inclined to find a middle ground. In any case, you will be more sure of your new chosen position, even if you return to where you started. 

Good luck on your learning journey."
dehydrating,fm3imn8,t3_fsjnmq,1585724817.0,"Zucchini chips are tasty and easy. Cut quarter inch slices, lay them in a single layer on the trays, add any seasoning (herb salt is good for starters). Dehydrate until crisp. 

Bonus: much lower in calories than potato chips so you can go ahead and make a tasty dip for them. 

We also like cabbage chips (blanch first), broccoli  crisps and green beans (all blanch first). 

Or you can make a dairy free and low fat mashed potato, spread on tray about 1/4 inch thick and dehydrate until crisp. Fat and dairy will affect the storage time so use something else to flavour it. Vegan recipes can be good for that."
