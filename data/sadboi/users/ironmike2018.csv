depression_help,fpafziq,t3_gc6arl,1588447381.0,"I deeply feel for you, having dealt with depression and suicidal ideation for many years.  Apparently, more than 10 million Americans endure suicidal ideation on a daily basis.  I am over that now, on the other side, but I remember it clearly.

I like the other comments in this post and I’ll add a few additional thoughts for consideration  and discussion.  These are not facts, just my ideas for you mull over if you wish.

1.  Your thoughts are your main problem.  You are “listening” to and believing shitty thoughts and assuming they are true.  They are killing your life force.  Perhaps you can find ways to flush shitty thoughts and develop the habit of making up better stories to tell yourself in your head.  So, first, stop believing the shitty stories playing in your head and search aggressively for thoughts and stories that make you feel better.   Step one is necessary but NOT sufficient for a better life.  Go on to step two:

2.  You are wasting a lot of time doing stuff that keeps you right where you are.  If you want to be right where you are now when you are 32, keep doing what you are doing every day now, and you will “succeed.”  If you’d rather be somewhere else, you’ll have to pick another vision and work your ass off every day to reach that place in 5 years.  If you say, “I can’t think of another vision, everything sucks” then you have to go back to #1 and take care of business.

3.  You are the scriptwriter, director, and star in the movie of your life.  Imagine yourself alone in a big movie theater, watching the story thus far. Are you happy with how the plot is going?  If not, spend some time figuring out alternatives and PICK ONE.  It does not have to be “ideal”, just better than the current plot, which is kinda boring., right?  Put some risk and hard work into your new plot.  Then be the hero of your own film and struggle and strive and kick some ass, and you’ll end up in a better place.  You might even feel personal pride in how you shifted your world.

4. The best example I know of this kind of reframing is David Goggins.  Have you seen any of his videos on YT?.   It is a good place to start.  
I hope these ideas at least give you a simple roadmap to create a better life experience for yourself.  YOU CAN DO THIS.

My best advice is to watch motivational speakers on YouTube or read books that either provide self-help suggestions or distraction (fiction, etc).

I tried a bunch of things to overcome depression over the years.  Reading probably helped me the most.  I am much better now.  
Here are two books that I think worked the fastest for me.  They have similar approaches, with some important differences, though.  
The first is “The Depression Cure,” which has six things you can do without too much effort.  
The second one is “Don’t Kill Yourself...Yet:  Unleash the Seven Life Hacks to Crush Depression and and Anxiety NOW.”  The first four hacks deal with the shit show in your head, and the last three deal with the crap in your external situation.  Kinda funny and very useful POV.  They are both available on Amazon and both are easy reads.  I hope they bring you some relief."

This process is described in detail in the book/audiobook “Don’t Kill Yourself Yet:  Unleash the Seven Life Hacks to Crush Depression and Anxiety NOW”.   A lot of other books and speakers tell you to overcome persistent negative thoughts, but they don’t really tell you how.  This book tells you how in a very direct manner in the first half of the book (first two hacks, actually).  If you do read or listen to it, pls let me know if it helps you.

Social relationships in your teens and early twenties can be unreliable and difficult.  You’ve had a rough ride, but that does not mean there is anything wrong with you.  Remember the old saying, “What people think about me is none of my business!”  They all have their own dramas going on in their heads, so don’t take their rude behavior into your heart.  You deserve better.  Do your best to avoid all the drama.  Maybe you can find one or two good volunteer opportunities to keep you occupied?

I want you to get help for your philophobia, bc you deserve to love and be loved.  Can you find a counselor at school?  If not, call the local crisis hotline in your area and they can refer you to free or super low cost counseling.  In time, you will learn to trust.  

You have a lot of runway ahead of you, so be patient with yourself.  Just make each day a little better than the day before and things will move in the right direction for you soon.  You can do this!"

Despite your disappointments and wasted time, I have to tell you that you are a very articulate writer.  You obviously are a clear thinker, despite what you might think about how you think (lol). 

Don’t hate me for saying this, but you have more going for you than you believe you do right now.  

Your life is just one long movie.  You get to be the script writer, director, producer, and main character.  The first 25-30 percent is over and you are not really happy with it, but let’s not dwell on that.  

Now it’s up to you to decide how the rest of the story goes.  It has to start from right where you are now, so, to be credible, it should gradually grow in some direction to the place you want it to be.  

As you know, writing a movie takes a lot of time and effort, so you’d better start spending some time tomorrow thinking about where you want yours to go from here.  Don’t worry about or compare your movie to other people’s movies, that will distract you from doing the best you can from where you are now.  

I hope you can look back in 5 or 7 years and say, wow, I made something interesting/decent/profound of my movie.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this...

Also, are you open to reading books that might help you change your life?  If so, let me know and I’ll suggest a couple of unusual titles."

In a nutshell, there is no meaning to life.  We each assign our own meaning.  Life is a huge buffet table.  You have to choose what to put on your plate and what to leave untouched.

Another way to look at is you are the script writer, producer, director and main character in the movie of your life.  Is that too many roles to play?  If not, start from where you are and see where you can go from here.  What story can you create?  Who will you include in your movie and what roles will you give them?  Will it be a rom-com, a tragedy, a comedy, drama, etc?

That is about all there is to it, IMO.  I hope you decide to create something you can feel good about!"

Another, more standard book, with good useful advice is “The Depression Cure” which is said to work better than meds or talk therapy.

2, The Four Agreements.  This best seller has four easy-to-remember concepts to help simplify everyday life and free your mind.
3.  The Depression Cure.  Six great steps to make sure you are taking care of your body and mind.

BTW, in the teen years, it is common in our society for girls to become more withdrawn and boys to become more assertive.  Please do not let that happen to you!

Here are some thoughts that might give you some relief.  Friendships can be really complicated and difficult - at any time, but especially during these years of rapid development.  Everyone is in their own heads and not so compassionate, imo.  The best way to make connections is through shared activities.  

To give you some recognition and meaningful interaction, consider involving yourself in activities that have REAL meaning to you.  It could be climate change, or feeding the poor, or tutoring younger kids in art, or volunteering at the local animal shelter, etc.  When you get involved in one or two “causes”, you will find your voice and also make friends who have similar interests.  

Also, check online to see if Toastmasters Youth Leadership Program has anything going near you.  I think you are ready for some leadership training, which will increase your poise and presence, so people will gravitate towards you more.  If Toastmasters is not available near you, see what else you can find.  

Also, if you want to read a couple of easy but interesting book to help you deal with the negative thoughts in your head, try these books that helped me and both my daughters:  The Four Agreements, and Don’t Kill Yourself...Yet:  Unleash the Seven Life Hacks to Crush depression and anxiety now.

depression_help,f9j8vzn,t3_e598hg,1575361537.0,"It feels like fear is holding you back.  Is that the crux of it?  

Let me offer a couple of ideas, weird as they might sound.  You need to get your creative energy to overwhelm your fears somehow.

First, write down all your fears on colorful paper and have some type of ceremony with a couple of good friends where you burn the fears and scatter the ashes to the wind.  

Second, look for a non-profit cause that you really care about, and contact an organization or two and offer to help them with their website or other marketing materials for free, for a while.  

Third, think of a few ways you can introduce graphic design to younger students in middle school or high school, to give them an idea of what it is like to study graphic design in college. Talking about it in this way might trigger your creativity again.

By doing things that are somewhere between school and actual career, you might find a stepping stone or transition phase that gets your creative juices flowing outside of an academic environment.

My last idea is to find some people who currently work in graphic design careers and do informational interviewing and networking with them.  Somewhere in the convo, ask them if they ever had this experience you are having, and, if so, how did they move through it?  

If these ideas don’t work for you, maybe they will stimulate some creative ideas of your own?  You WILL get through this and enjoy your career, which you are talented at and well-trained for.  Best wishes!"

Are there one or two people you could reach out to?  Not necessarily to dump the whole story on, but just to hang together and hold space together for a time?  Sometimes just being with one other person in a casual way can provide relief.

If you are willing to read a couple of self help books, I would be glad to recommend a couple that have helped me a lot.  I have read dozens, so I’ll save you the trouble of wading through all of them, and tell you my favorites.  Just let me know, OK?  

In the meantime, can you do one thing or reach out to one person to make today just a little bit better than yesterday?  If you can spare the time, find a cause to volunteer a few hours of your time every week.  That could work wonders!

I also really benefitted from The Four Agreements, which was a best seller.  Four simple “agreements’ you make with yourself to get out of the hell of human existence.  Easy to remember and I got pretty good at it, I think.  

Both books say we are in a battle and offer ways to survive and dominate.  I use them every day, esp when I wake up in the AM!  

If you like either of these, I can suggest a couple of others, out of the dozens I have tried over the years."

I believe you will soar once you are on your own for a few months.  There are a lot of sources of support (outside family) and I know you will search them out and benefit from them.  

If you like to read books, I can suggest a couple to help you cope with negative people in your life."
depression_help,f9h7n1c,t3_e4uylt,1575310449.0,"Ok this helps me understand the picture a lot.  You show a lot of poise, determination, and emotional strength.  In the long run that might be too much for him to handle, but I sense this trip could work out well.  

I think your approach makes good sense.  Not swooping in to rescue him, but being around in case he wants to come out of his shell for a bit.  A smart move might be to schedule each day for yourself in some detail in advance, in case he’s not available.  You could save a couple of open spots early on to low-key meet him for coffee.  Then leave and go about your day, if that feels right.

By the second day/time you get together, things might be back to normal and you can chuck the rest of the schedule.  If not, you are preserving your life force and maintaining your emotional boundaries.   Something like that sound ok?  The best you can do is hold space with/for him, imo.

Hopefully he’ll feel better well before the trip, as you say. I really hope this blows over for you both."
SuicideWatch,f9h64w7,t3_e4t45d,1575309707.0,"Thanks for clarifying your perspective.  I get your point and I believe I know the feeling.   I am in a different place now, as I am a bit older.  I am no longer suffering as you are, but I still am indifferent as to whether I am here or there.  

Bruce Moen wrote a series of 4 books detailing his trance exploration of the after-death environment.  His perspective is my favorite of many books on the topic I’ve read over the years.  They start off a bit slow (he was an engineer, not a journalist), but the content gets better and better.  You might want to check them out, kinda like travel brochures so you can land on your “feet” on the other side.  According to him, the after-death environment is more elaborate and multi-faceted than physical reality.

If you decide to hang around a bit longer, I’d like to offer you a couple of books to read that pulled me out of the dark, dank hole of chronic depression.  Let me know if you’d like that.

In the meantime, I hope today is a little bit better than yesterday for you."
depression_help,f9h4nry,t1_f9fl154,1575309074.0,"I call these people Shit Slingers.  They destroy your life force.  There are tips on how to handle them in the second half of a book I like, called “Don’t Kill Yourself...Yet”.  In a nutshell, you have to stand your ground and “Smack Back” when they sling shit at you.  You don’t escalate, you just say things like, “Yelling will not solve anything.  Please speak to me with respect and I will do the same to you.”  Or, “your yelling triggers my anxiety.  Should I contact the company HR department about your aggressive manner”.  

Sometimes you have to use the Broken Record technique and just say the same thing over and over until they get the message or go away.  

Remember, you have just as much right to be here and hold your space in this reality as she does, even if she’s a bully.  I am rooting for you!"

SuicideWatch,f9fh73c,t3_e4t45d,1575271639.0,"I went on a rant in a post by a 14 year old, but I’d like to repeat it here in case it is of some value to you.  It might seem like all those things you mentioned are the source of your misery, but I’d like do suggest it is primarily the shit show running in your head.  Anyway, here is the rant;

People say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but after years of researching different opinions on the after-death environment, I have come to believe the opposite,  Actually, suicide is a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  

The problem, of course, is the daunting pain of an endless stream of shitty thoughts and feelings. Going into the after-death environment with the shit stream going full tilt probably does not bring the desired relief.  That’s my view at this time, anyway.  

I have come to believe that the solution - and challenge-  is to develop a personality that is unfuckwithable, no matter the environment.  Then it does not matter what reality we are in.  You own your space and stand your ground in every reality.  That’s the goal and challenge of being human. 

If you decide to take this challenge in this lifetime, there are many places to go for support and guidance.  The first step, starting right this minute, is to STOP believing those shitty thoughts in your head.  They are not real.  They are some bullshit virtual reality that some unknown force is shoving down your mind (like shoving corn down the throats of geese to fatten their livers for foigras pate.). 

Stop believing the bullshit that streams through your head non-stop.  Tell it to shut TF up, a million times in a row, if you have to.  Then, when the shit storm stops for a bit, start to think about who you REALLY are, beyond all the fear and longing, and who you want to be in relation to the mayhem going on around us.

I’m getting kinda worked up about this, so I’ll stop for now.  Let me know what you think, OK?"

By life force, I mean the feeling of energy and intent that flows through us and motivates us to deal with the daily grind. When life force is high, the little shit does not bother us in the least.  When we are overwhelmed with the BS, our life force runs low.  Low life force for a long time is chronic depression imo.

depression_help,f98athg,t3_e49bmf,1575176021.0,"I am impressed with your ability to focus on your assignments given the stress you are feeling.  I have a bunch of ideas, since you did ask, so see if any of these are of use to you. They kinda go in order.

1. Thank your boyfriend for his previous support.  Tell him you realize he is tapped out at the moment, so you’ll check back in with him later when all the assignments are done and you can re-create your relationship.  He did what he could, helped you get this far, now he needs a break to deal with his own “movie.” (If he is not available, thank him in your mind and release this issue for now.)

2.  Give yourself at least one hour to breathe deeply, take a hot bath, go for a relaxing walk, listen to it your favorite music or whatever it takes to nurture and calm yourself.  This is NOT optional, it must be done, so the stress chemicals in your body can cycle through and you can center yourself.  When you can say, “AAAHHHHH” you are ready for the next step.  

3.  Once you are calm, get a piece of clean paper and a pencil or pen.  First, start with the end in mind.  Decide what you are going to do to reward yourself when all the assignments are done, at what date. PIck something you know you will enjoy, so the end point/goal line can stay alive in your mind.

4. Next, decide how well you really want/need to do in each class with pending assignments.  Some are less important than others.  Given your current stress, you might have to triage, and just let some classes or assignments barely get by, so you can focus more on the ones that really matter to you. Be realistic, depending on how you feel and how much time you have.  Everything can rarely if ever be perfect or completely optimized.

5.  Make a schedule of how you will work on each assignment between now and the due date. The more “granular”you can be, the better.  If you are the type of person who can schedule hour by hour, then do that.  If that is too regimented for you, make blocks of several hours or half days. Fill it in, preferably in pencil!  BE SURE TO ADD A FEW BREAKS EVERY NOW AND THEN SO YOU CAN REPEAT NUMBER 2 ABOVE!

6.  If you start falling behind, for whatever reason - meltdown, distraction, harder work than you thought - just adjust the schedule (or redo it completely) and do the best you can with the time you have left.

7.  Every time you actually accomplish something on the schedule, give your self a REAL physical pat on the back and praise yourself ALOUD.  You are working your program.  

Believe me or not, it does not really matter all that much - in the grand scheme of things - how well this all turns out.  What does matter is that you nurture yourself during a difficult time, and you DO YOUR BEST.  If you always do your best (ADYB), things will be ok and you’ll have few regrets.

This is just one scene in the movie of your long life.  Write your script and do your best to act it out the way you envision it.  Best of luck!   You got this, I know you do!

(BTW, not to humble brag but to let you know this works, I graduated with high honors from UCLA using this approach, and I was not well-grounded at the time!)"
