I had been diagnoscate with depression for almost half year, maybe this will cost me much more time to get back to normality, but gladly I have my parents to take care of me and luckily they are easy with me, and so I have my dog and little cousins who always give me the force to get out of the bed and try to not crying in front of them, I know you can beat this, think about how happy you were back then and don't mortify yourself because that, beside think of that as a objective like a goal or an achievement, to be like you were 3-4 years ago."
