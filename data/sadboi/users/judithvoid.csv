bikecommuting,fqzqkv3,t1_fqzq13v,1589773059.0,"Yep. The front wheel is 24inches and is designed with the frame to accommodate small riders. The company was started by a woman who had polio as a child and couldn't find a bike that fit her, so she learned to weld. To my knowledge, new bikes by her start around 4k, but this one is older and retailed for around $400-500 in the 80's."

You would probably want the thin smooth tires built for roads. For my commute I ride a vintage schwinn varsity but wouldn't buy a new Schwinn. If I had money I would be riding one of the brands that have been suggested to you! 

Also, I want to mention that you don't have to limit yourself to ""women's"" bikes, which could widen your options if you're on a budget. If it fits you, go for it. I will say that a step-through frame is helpful if you keep a big cargo rack on the back, or you have very short legs."
