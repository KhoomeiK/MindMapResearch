So here are some reasons why you shouldn't quit your job right now (with some help from my friends):

The plans you are having don't just happen overnight. They take lots of planning and preparation. If you don't have a business plan for your store and you don't have plots and blocking and framing all on paper for your channel then you aren't ready to do any of those  things. If you really into doing these projects then doing those prepwork things that don't cost anything should be a piece of cake. If blocking and scripting a scene sounds like horrible work, then maybe you don't want to create a YouTube channel after all and just want the fame or attention.

Do some tests that don't cost money. It would cost you nothing to just prop up your phone pointed at your self and do some screen tests. Do what you think would be in your channel. Noone but you would ever see the video but it would be a first chance to see what it would actually look like and to see whether it is even remotely how you imagined in your head.  You could make just one single item that doesn't require that you get new tools or supplies and that you think would sell on etsy and then post it on facebook marketplace or ebay and see if there is actually any interest in your idea.

And most importantly, if you are starting a big new project then you need capital. And that means having a ""day job"". So even if your big ideas are good ideas and you were neurotypical, you would still need to keep your current job in order to make your dreams possible."

asktransgender,fquywxh,t3_gl36na,1589666663.0,"It means that it isn‚Äôt objective. For example gravity is not a social construct. Gravity is exactly the same for every human. A person 100 years ago, a person in China, and a person in the US would all get the same results from observing and using gravity. Gender norms on the other hand are social constructs which means that they are entirely dependent on the culture in which you are embedded. A hundred years ago in US culture, boys rooms were pink and all well-to-do toddlers wore dresses whether they are a boy or a girl. 100 years later the same US paints a boys room blue and puts toddler boys in pants and toddler girls in dresses. So if someone from the US is shown a picture of a Chinese toddler in a pink room wearing a dress, the person from the US has absolutely no idea whether the toddler is a boy or a girl just from the context because that person only knows the US culture constructs but trying to apply those constructs to a different culture produces incorrect assumptions/results. So the takeaway is that if someone wants to wear a dress, that doesn‚Äôt by itself make the person a woman or even feminine. It only means that if the person lives in a culture with those constructed meaning and the person doing it accepts those constructs and is deliberately using those constructs as a form of expression."

If someone was using something like head and shoulders daily and then stops, then they will have rebound dandruff until their body adjusts to not being constantly medicated. Other people have fungal (e.g. ringworm), or psoriasis, or uticaria, or acne, or staph, or scratches and injuries and they just aren't diagnosing it properly because they aren't looking at their scalp. Some of these can be cured with the proper medication (like fungal) after which the dandruff will go away. Others can't be cured (like psoriasis or uticaria) and can only be managed for symptoms with medication, although it is better use a medicated poo or pill that treats the underlying condition (like coal tar for psoriasis or antibiotic for staph) rather than something that treats only symptoms (like head and shoulders)."

That's kind of like teenage girls who have their dream wedding scrapbook, but don't even have a boyfriend. A relationship isn't something where you decide what type of named relationship you want and then shop around for a person to fit into it. A relationship is where you connect with a person and then have to figure out how to build a relationship that can hold all the people even if it doesn't have a name. 

If you've never opened up your relationship before, then I recommend please don't make your friends your first. No matter how prepared you are, you will discover things about yourselves, find emotions that you didn't know you had, miss emotions you thought you had but don't. The first time will always be drama. So much drama. After which you and your husband will need some time and space to reconnect with each other before you set out to try again, this time actually being prepared. Maybe your first time should be someone from a hookup app where they know that it's just a one-time event and aren't expecting more than getting off and then getting out of your hair. That way they won't feel used and objectified when that's what ends up happening because it's what they were looking for in the first place."
GayPolyamory,fouwofx,t3_g9pv9h,1588091632.0,"What are your goals here? Are you expecting some casual sex on the side of the friendship?  Are you feeling an intense emotional connection to one or both of them and are wanting an enduring relationship at the same level as your husband?  Are you equally interested in both of them, or are you interested in one of them but think that they are a package deal?  Are you and your husband a package deal?  Have all of that figured out before you drop a bomb on them; after all, how are they supposed to have an answer if you don't have answers of your own?

In any case, most realistic paths forward would involve one of one couple establishing a bond with one of the other couple and that would be the catalyst for anything happening with any of the other possible pairings (if anything even does; in reality it's more likely that the other possible pairings would end up not being interested or lose interest more quickly).   

If you just want casual sex as a one time thing that definitely includes all four, then that's really only likely to spontaneously happen as part of a larger sex-positive social gathering. But if you were at the point of attending that type of party together then you'd probably already know where they stood. 

You should also work your way up to that level of comfort with them. If you wouldn't be comfortable talking about sex with them, then you're definitely not going to be comfortable actually having sex with them. So if they hear you tell a story about going on a date with someone who isn't your husband, or how frustrated you are with the local Grindr matches, they'd immediately know  that you have an open relationship, and you would most likely immediately know their opinion of that without having made a move on them."

BDSMcommunity,fo34d0l,t3_g5c7bb,1587480317.0,"I think that first you need to decide whether you are still into the kink and just want to find a way to exclude your ex from the kink, or whether you are completely over the kink and want to find your way back to vanilla. The approach is going to be very different for those two goals. If you like the kink and just want to get over the ex, I've found that doing things like self-collaring can be very empowering to be your own master and to develop a headspace where recognize that you are who gives doms their power. The cum control can become part of your own masturbation/fantasy life even without a partner and will eventually feel like something you bring to any potential relationship rather than something that the dom brings to a relationship.     On the other hand if you are just trying to get out of this particular kink entirely then I have less experience, but I would guess that you would just want to try reconditioning with a lot of vanilla media and that the key is not thinking about your ex (and not thinking about not thinking about your ex)."

This is a problem. Relationships are work. Relationships involve learning from each other and teaching each other. If you aren't willing to invest a few months of teaching in order to improve the entire rest of the relationship, then you aren't really invested in the relationship.

> I will cheat on anything less. 

So you've basically already decided that you'll cheat on him whenever he disappoints you. That is on you. Don't twist it into his fault. You aren't thinking of cheating because he's bad in bed. You are thinking of it because the idea appeals to you.

> he says he is not interested and only wants me   
>  
> he is now OK with being sexually open long-distance but had previously never considered it for a local relationship. 

It sounds like he isn't into poly or non-mono. You sound like you are. That's a hard combination if one of the people isn't ace. 

Also, if you open up the relationship now, then it's going to be extremely hard to close it back up just because you become colocated. So when you and he are discussing it, don't pretend like it is a viable option."

Original:

From what I can tell, the things still marked as Prime are the ""essential"" items that they are still willing to ship with two-day shipping whereas the ""Free for prime members"" used to be things that were shipped by third-party sellers without two-day shipping but the shipping was free for prime members, but now has been extended to everything that used to be ""Prime"" but has now been classified as non-essential and therefore delayed shipping.

gaybros,fn9r844,t3_fz80u9,1586782491.0,"I think it's important not to treat different companies as if they are the same company. If one airline censors a gay movie and a different airline censors a straight movie, then those two things aren't ""equal"" because they aren't being done by the same people. You have to look at individual cases and not blanket statements in order to determine whether there is a bias. For example, the recent censoring of the gay kiss in Schitt's Creek happened by outlets that don't censor the equivalent straight kiss.  Meanwhile, on American Airlines, the transatlantic flights show full frontal nudity in some movies, but the domestic flights censor language, nudity, and violence in most movies; so if I were going to judge American Airlines I would have to do it on a route-by-route basis and not even on a company basis."

I like things to start with a peck, and then let things go from there with how it evolves being a negotiation.

Hopefully it will help to know that other people have made it through this type of situation, so you can have hope for yourself. I had to take out a loan for my last two semesters. It wasn't a nice federal loan with good interest rates. It was a personal student loan directly from a bank with an interest rate worse than a federal loan but better than a credit card. There aren't any strings attached to that kind of loan, so I was able to use it to pay tuition, books, food, rent, gas, etc. People who get private loans for their entire college end up with an insurmountable debt.

GayChristians,fmbkgjf,t3_fu5f9j,1585928137.0,"I would argue that ""worldview"", ""truth"", and ""connection to Jesus"" are three different things. ""Worldview"" would be reading the story of Daniel and believing that it means that God will physically protect you from harm.  ""Truth"" would be reading the story of Daniel and then debating about whether its depiction of public prayer conflicts with or is superseded by Matthew 6. ""Connection to Jesus"" would be reading the story of Daniel and believing that it means that you shouldn't be ashamed of your religion. 

&#x200B;

So if your theology is primarily focused on ""truth"" and ""sanction"", then there is a lot to be argued about whether or not to wear a head covering, and whether or not to eat pork, and whether or not to pray publicly, and whether or not  being gay is Christian. But you will never reach a conclusion on any of those topics. You will have only questions without answers. For some people that may be the right choice and it follows in the long tradition philosophical analysis in which the debate and commentary which is more important than the original scripture or the answer of a question.  But for many people this is unsatisfying and instead of switching to a different philosophy they resort to cherry-picking individual pieces of scripture to support one answer while discarding parts of scripture that conflict with that answer.

""Worldview"" and ""connection"" theologies are more flexible in that you can read a scripture like Daniel and come away from with with a general concept that you can use to improve your life instead of trying to mimic every detail of Daniel's life that was mentioned in the story. It's a viewpoint that can allow you to read the story of Moses and come away from it with ideas of redemption and transformation and not just fixate on the two passages that say tattoos and gay sex are bad as if those are what the story of Moses is about; all the rest of the pages are there for a reason."

So if they have a patient who doesn't find the right one after two or three trials or one year, then they pull out the genetic test, not so that they know what drug will work, but rather so that they know what order to do the remaining trials in to hopefully find the right one sooner and not go through years of unnecessary bad-drug experiences."

naltrexone,flkj1z2,t3_fpd9a6,1585241853.0,"Not a doctor, but here are my thoughts as someone who's taken or helped someone with most of these.  Don't get obsessed with the number of pills. Focus on what you are trying to achieve with each pill. Each of those drugs does something completely different. You aren't going to manage both cravings and anxiety with a single drug.  The propranolol will help anxiety by blocking adrenaline; so basically not letting your body start into a runaway loop in a panic attack. You will still have the mental anxiety, but not the physical anxiety.   The naltrexone will block the reward for drinking, so over time you will learn that drinking isn't fun anymore (note that if the number of pills overwhelms you, then this is one that can be a monthly shot so that your pill keeper has less in it).  The baclofen is going to address some of the physical withdrawal symptoms you will have when you stop drinking (e.g. tremors). I'm guessing it would just be a temporary prescription until you get past the withdrawal period.  The lexapro keeps you from being depressed so that you maintain hope and don't give up. 

The one that surprises me is the librium because benzos are addictive and it seems like an overlap with the propranolol and the baclofen. My doctor also told me to never ever take a benzo at the same time as propranolol, so careful with that."

For example, if your partner were thinking of quitting his job and applying for a new job, you would have input into that decision of whether he quits his job, what kind of job he applies for, whether he applies for a job out of state.  But ultimately it's up to him whether he actually does any of it, and even if you say that you ""veto"" an out-of-state job he could still do it anyway and your only power over it is whether you choose to move with him or not.
