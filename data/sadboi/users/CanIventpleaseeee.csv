selfharm,fmk1cbp,t3_fvq98i,1586142200.0,"Depression is.. not wanting to get out of bed in the morning because you have no motivation to. You feel helpless and that nothing you do matters. There are a few types of depression. You have clinical depression where it’s severe. Suicidal thoughts, maybe self harm. You have less severe depression, not suicidal but still don’t enjoy things as much as you used to. Theres a whole thing about it all on the NHS website. I’m not too sure about the urge to punch yourself thing but it can be called ‘self harm’: Self harm doesn’t always have to be cutting or something like that. It can be punching yourself and doing anything to hurt yourself. Personally, I would go to the doctor about that and see whats up. For the how do you see if you have depression, I would go to an NHS website, see if you have any symptoms and then go to the doctor to confirm. Sorry I wasn’t able to correctly answer everything but hope I helped a little bit!"
selfharm,fmk02sg,t3_fvq83t,1586141357.0,Yes. Please stop.. At least try to! It fucks up your life and the scars only remind you of what everything was like. My recommendation would be to tell a parent what has happened or tell someone you trust.. But someone you know irl. (Not your friends.. an adult.) So far all my scars have done is made me rub my arm because im uncomfortable and makes me feel like doing it again. Its unhealthy so please don’t continue ❤️ You’re amazing and I love you. Please don’t do this too yourself. You deserve way better than to be harming yourself. So please. Find help. Clean your cuts (you can find some ways online) and try to get yourself out of it. One day it will become a habit and trust me. It will become a shit-show. Stay safe ❤️ You are amazing. Stay strong hun x
