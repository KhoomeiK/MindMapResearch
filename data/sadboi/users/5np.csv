gaming,f00ff4j,t1_f00bl94,1568301156.0,"The thing is with Stanford is every student there is an overachiever who got top grades. I would go into a test thinking the subject material was easy and I could ace it, so I didn't need to spend a ton of time acing it - but that also meant that every other student thought it was easy and the middle of the curve was 94% or something high.

If it was hard, it was really fucking hard.

I breezed through the first year of physics (basically, physics for engineers) because it was sort of a review. Then I got hit really damn hard by second year physics. I was lost during proofs. PDEs was miserable and I barely passed. I was like at the bottom of the curve for everything. 

I think it honestly might have been my ADHD. I lost a symbol somewhere halfway through page 1 of my equations and I was totally fucked. Plus depression and all the various difficulties of college life hit me really hard. Basically, I was smart enough so that high school was very easy, but not smart enough to breeze through college and I had no real study skills in place. And the more I read from other people with ADHD, the more I think it has to do with that than everything else. 

I could zone out in high school and get As. If I fell behind in college, even by a few days, I would just get further behind every week until I was totally screwed. 

After graduating Stanford I went to a local commuter school and took CS courses, including typical math for CS majors. I did quite well in the programming courses. The math there was hard for me as well but I almost got an A in it... almost. I got a high B. 

Math literally was always my worst subject since I was a kid. I've actually always scored higher on verbal subjects and did well in English class. I studied the sciences because I thought they were overwhelmingly beautiful, and while this sounds douchey, I don't like the way liberal arts are taught at the college level."

Best at a high school level is completely different from best in college, which is different from best in grad school, which is completely different from best at a national level. 

Math was actually my worst subject in high school, but I've been passionate about science since I was a little kid so I did that. Whoops. I was a well rounded student and I feel that's helpful in high school, but a strong area of focus is better for college and grad school.
