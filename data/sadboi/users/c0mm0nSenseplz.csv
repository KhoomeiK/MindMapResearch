We just don't know. I know people don't want to believe this, but its possible. It just really exposes a lot of hypocrisy in the DNC. I expect this from conservatives, but not from us.

TheMajorityReport,fpdg064,t1_fpdc5q5,1588526255.0,"I think its an opinion piece that just poses a bunch of ""what ifs"", what I personally would like to hear more about is from her friends/neighbors. Survivors tend to talk more about this stuff to friends then the press/police/bosses etc etc:

""She said the reporter’s tone made her feel uncomfortable and ""I just really got shut down” and didn't tell the whole story.

It is hard to believe a reporter would discourage this kind of scoop. ""

Just an example. It could be that she just didn't feel like talking about it, we also know that its pretty routine for sexual assault victims to not be believed so its possible his tone was questioning. Look how people have reacted.

Do I know its true for certain? No of course not but if it is true her reactions are not abnormal. This feels very similar to Clinton-Lewinsky to be honest as Peck pointed out. 

Biden is pretty fucking creepy, but lots of politicians are... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAUOurZIVfI"
TheMajorityReport,fpd9eey,t3_gcfh27,1588522522.0,"Biden has routinely violated people's personal space, particularly women's in front of all of us for years. He has always made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Its a huge red flag.

TheMajorityReport,fpd94q3,t3_gcrbf8,1588522368.0,"Took me about 30 years to fully admit and realize that I was assaulted. I was told I was a liar multiple times I reported it. I was also extremely young. I have a lot of trauma and spent a lot of my life disassociated. I also had addiction problems for awhile.

I am in recovery, in therapy and also a social worker. This shit kinda happens. Honestly, I think Trump is part of the reason I was able to start really ""waking up"". When you are abused by a narcissist they have a way of making you feel crazy. Its also fucking scary and traumatic. Its very confusing as well and you tend to feel like its your fault.

I still get called a liar and crazy by my family, I just was able to break away and find out people support me. Turns out there is also some documentation. Too. Biden is a notorious boundary breaker, that behavior is a huge red flag.

She talked about it to a few people, this is pretty common. Most assaults are not reported. The way this is being covered up is sick. The few times I have told people I do believe Reade I get told I am a Trump supporter.

TLDR: Talking about being sexually assaulted isn't fun, its fucked to ask why people didn't talk about trauma early.

Also, I am a guy for the record."

Yeah but that area can be pretty sketch... I mean its not offensive to point out that lots of areas in Rockford are pretty rough. Rockford has some serious issues. That is okay to point out. 

Really depends on where you are from and what you are used to. Could I live around Prarie Street? Sure, but I grew up here. That being said, I am looking for places right now and looking more towards Loves Park (which also can be sketch) but I don't drink and going out isn't really that big of a concern."

T's base also really plays up their love for the police and military. Its pretty frequent to see pretty pro-police stuff at Trump rallies. Now mind you, militia groups in places like Michigan used to be very anti-police. That has changed now. They are ""anti-fed"" now but love the police. Why?
