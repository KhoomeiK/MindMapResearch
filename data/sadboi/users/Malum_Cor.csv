When you're faced with a large competitor like that, it's likely you're not going to have great luck if you want to try and focus on broad general keywords, in this example a broad keyword could be ""indoor paint"". You're likely to get more traffic, and more valuable traffic at that, if you shift your focus to long-tail keywords/keyphrases with less competition, e.g. ""affordable indoor paint brooklyn"". This will require some keyword research on your part to determine which keywords are most relevant to your site and have a high enough search volume to justify spending time creating content around it.

Google really does prefer showing users the content most relevant to their search term as well as other factors such as their location and the device they're using.

If you have a quality website with a good structure, good user experience, proper content without thin pages, set up your Google My Business account, and optimised your website with proper metadata, redirects and some quality backlinks, your website has the absolute potential to outrank websites like Yelp. Websites with unique, valuable content will be preferred over listing type sites and user-generated content centered websites.

Also, remember, sites as large as those may have enormous backlink profiles but they're prone to easily gaining thousands of bad quality toxic links which lowers their authority. Quality links from a few different domains will get you a lot further than hundreds of links from the same domain or spammy domains.

Invest some extra time into your keyword research, there are some great guides out there. Get proper content (no matter what your website is for) and reach out for backlinks from quality sites.

Good luck! There's a little spot for everyone under the ""Google sun""."
SEO,fpftmix,t3_gd7p2h,1588583039.0,"Local SEO is really beneficial and preferred by Google. It is entirely possible for you to outrank large national sites by being more location specific. To be clear, you will then outrank these sites in your location instead of ""in general"".  

In web searches, users' locations are taken into account when searching, whether it's typed into the search term or not (should the users' location settings be turned on).   
Google's entire business model is to create a good user experience, so if your website is relevant to the search term AND to the user's location, you can surely rank higher.

For example, let's say your website sells paint in New York. When a user searches ""paint stores"" they may be met with results like Dulux, or a top paint brand. However, if a user's location settings are turned on or if they were to search ""paint stores new york"", *your* website will be more useful and relevant, making it easier to grab that ranking over the big competitor.

Hope that helps :)"

I'm 26F, not overweight, and main symptoms up until about a year ago was crippling headaches. Within the last year my pain has nearly doubled with excruciating pain in and around my eyes and ears on top of the headaches. I was put on Diamox, 6 tablets daily. The medication caused me to be admitted to hospital after it made me too weak to even brush my own hair. Now, I'm nearly catatonic from severe pain at least 3 to 4 times a week and other than that the pain is always there. 
My eyesight is deteriorating with my glasses, which were made 3 months ago, aren't helping enough.

iih,f5lxdcj,t3_do7enm,1572284419.0,"Hi Miley,

My journey was very much the same. I spent 8 years searching for a diagnosis. So much money for special clinics and doctors only to tell me I'm the 1% they can't help.
Whenever doctors couldn't diagnose me they would simply shrug their shoulders and tell me that it's ""stress"".

I'm a 26 year old female from Cape Town, South Africa. Other than my gender and age I don't fit the profile for the IIH. Been keeping fairly healthy through life and I'm not overweight.

I understand your frustration so deeply and it breaks my heart that it cost you your vision to get a diagnosis. This isn't an easy diagnosis. When IIH isn't making me sick (which is a daily struggle) it's the Acetozolamide.

You're not alone. Drink a lot of water with the Diamox and if it makes you sick tell your doctor immediately. I was rendered so sick and weak at one point, I couldn't even stand in the shower or brush my own hair and ended up in hospital for over a week with a stomach ulcer to boot.

Stay strong. Communicate with your doctors. Hope that the nerve damage isn't fully permanent 💕"

My IIH diagnosis is fairly recent even though I've been suffering for 9 years. I feel the exact same way. I love gaming and would usually try to find any excuse to do it, but now it literally feels like I am completely uninterested in anything and everything.

The only thing that helps me is when I use Cannabis for the pain, I am a different and happy person able to thoroughly enjoy everything. I am of course not suggesting you take the same route but I have exhausted every other option for pain relief and it's that helps, both for IIH and medication side effects.

I hope you find what it is that gives you your spark back x"
