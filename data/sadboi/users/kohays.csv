Even as someone born right on the tail end of being a millennial or the very first Gen Z I don't think I care enough to use this to gain ""internet points"" over other people by using my birth year as an argument.

That whole tik tok / fortnite thing gets annoying, but I will say the stereotype seems to become more and more true about those who get younger in age. Like there's definitely NOT alot of 21+ tik tok users, and if they are their usually social media ""influencers"" or whatever it is so their making money doing it, as opposed to just using it for entertainment. When fortnite came out I was already out of college, and most people my age have no interest even in those type of games so I think it's more popular with younger kids too.
