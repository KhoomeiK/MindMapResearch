If the graphics are designed in such a way that the enemies don't stand out clearly from the background, then the gameplay will be unfair and won't be enjoyable. If there are obvious graphical glitches and faults, that will break the player's immersion and prevent them from getting emotionally invested in the story. If the graphics don't provide clear visual feedback on what each button on the controller does, then the player will find the control scheme confusing. etc. etc. etc."

Certainly if someone I knew personally was behaving in an entitled and inconsiderate fashion, I would think the sensible thing to do would be to actually explain to them why their behaviour is inappropriate, rather than just call them names.

In my experience the term ""Karen"" is rarely used in the context of two acquaintances talking to one another, but rather to poke fun at a particular type of person (i.e. a woman who behaves in a rude, entitled and inconsiderate fashion, particularly towards service industry workers on low salaries), without singling out any specific member of that group. If I'm a waiter, and a woman comes into the restaurant in which I work and berates me for something which is out of my control, I'm not really in a position to constructively criticize her behaviour (I would probably lose my job if I did, and she is unlikely to pay any attention to my critique anyway). However, venting about the *type* of person who does this sort of thing allows me to blow off steam, and ideally raises awareness of a particular kind of antisocial behaviour. 

Venting on social media about a group of people who behave a certain way without identifying a specific member is also, I think, a vastly preferable alternative to naming and shaming a specific person in hopes of ""cancelling"" them. I don't think a person should lose their job or get inundated with social media death threats just because they are rude and inconsiderate to service industry workers, but hopefully raising awareness of the general pattern of behaviour might encourage certain people to reflect on their behaviour and how they treat others."

So it's always misogynistic to criticize a woman, *unless* she is ""using structural inequalities as a weapon""? That's the only context in which it's justified to criticize a woman, no matter how badly she's behaving?

Supposing I'm in a busy, understaffed restaurant. The wait staff (who are all minimum-wage and most of whom are also in college) are run off their feet, doing their best to keep sixty customers happy. A particular 50-year-old woman is loudly berating and humiliating one of the waiters about how long it's taking for her meal to arrive, even though she ordered it less than fifteen minutes ago and it's obvious that the restaurant is extremely busy. The waiter is extremely flustered and apologetic, but the 50-year-old woman doesn't care about any of this and continues complaining and yelling at the waiter, who can't do anything about the situation.

I think this 50-year-old woman is being rude, inconsiderate and entitled. I do not care one iota whether the waiter is white, black, straight, gay, trans, whatever. I think this woman's behaviour would be equally deserving of criticism regardless of the identity characteristics of the waiter (and for that matter, the woman's behaviour would be equally deserving of criticism regardless of the identity characteristics of the waiter). 

You seem to be saying, however, that it would only be justified to criticize this woman for her behaviour if the waiter was a person of colour, or trans, or Muslim etc., but if the waiter is a white male, then criticizing the woman is misogynistic. I do not buy this logic for a second. I think that the woman's behaviour is unacceptable and deserving of criticism regardless of the identity of the person to whom she's directing her behaviour."

If I call a specific man a wanker, or tell him that he's acting like a Nice Guyâ„¢, I'm not making a generalisation about men as a whole: I'm criticizing that specific man.

However, their knowing the information in question would be strong evidence that they were stalking me, which *is* a crime (variously defined) in numerous jurisdictions, and rightfully so.

You are conflating the free expression of opinions with stalking and invasion of privacy. They are not the same thing."

That seems *extremely* counter-intuitive to me.

Alice: ""I think a woman's right to choose is an extremely important ethical principle.""

Bob: ""If elected, I want to make abortion illegal again as soon as possible.""

Carol: ""I'm really worried that, if elected, Alice will try to curtail access to abortion. I'm going to vote for Bob instead."""

If Alice says that she thinks Bob's lifestyle is evil and degenerate, or thinks Bob shouldn't be allowed live in this country because of his ethnicity, and I arrest Alice, I have not ""protected a literal life from bigots"". I have just arrested someone for expressing a horrible opinion."
