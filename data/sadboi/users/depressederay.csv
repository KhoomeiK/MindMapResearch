Thanks for your answer, you are right, a man made chemical which can destroy everything. I stick to god made plants, Kratom and Cannabis help a little."

My main problem is anxiety. If my anxiety is reduced, the depression fades away, just a little, too. So I take Elvanse not everyday because it is an amphetamine and can increase anxiety.

You need to learn more about biochemistry to understand better."

Drugs,f7hulc6,t1_f7htlrd,1573747728.0,Yes because these drugs are being studied since years and are becoming part of psychotherapy because of their powerful therapeutic effects with more success than any other kind of psycho pharmaceutical.
Drugs,f7hscwa,t1_f7hriut,1573746606.0,"If no medication or therapy was helping before, you should try LSD, Ketamine, Mushrooms or MDMA.

Psychedelics are healing. Very healing. Ketamine is used in some clinics in Europe, MDMA and Psilocybin in America, look for the MAPS organization that has healed many people with PTSD, depression and anxiety. 

Another method would be trying those substances yourself, if you have a plug who deals; it's illegal of course but who cares."
Drugs,f7hqj8e,t1_f7hprk4,1573745693.0,"I have had anxiety since my childhood too. I'm always anxious but I would never touch a benzodiazepine in my life again. I just accept my anxiety as it is. Be friend with all of your feelings, they are not trying to kill you, they just want to tell you that something is wrong. Anxiety sucks but it can be treated with psychotherapy."
Drugs,f7hoo64,t3_dw868o,1573744706.0,"Benzodiazepines are completely trash.
Don't fool yourself by justifying taking Xanax because you have ""random anxiety attacks"".
Anxiety can be treated via psychotherapy. No one on this planet needs benzos. 

What did anxious people do before barbiturates and benzodiazepines were even there? 

People get sick because they have forgotten to be in touch with their feelings. The pharmacy industry has made many healthy people sick. Especially benzodiazepines. No one needs them privately.

But it's your decision. I thought I could take Valium responsibly but even with the most carefulness behavior it destroyed me.

Telling ""Alprazolam is magical"" just shows you are absolutely amazed by it. Being amazed by an addictive drug leads mostly into full blown addiction, mostly you don't even notice that."
Drugs,f7fd6el,t3_dvpvqs,1573676920.0,"I love doing Molly alone. Just listening to music and drowning into euphoria. Going deep inside myself. Learning more. It is therapeutic. 

My issue is suffering from anxiety disorder and Molly makes me see my anxiety from a different angle. I'm always anxious and that ruins my life. On MDMA I can welcome anxiety and let it be and not fight against it."

I used MDMA in the past but without any psychotherapist.

It opened my heart, erased my fears. I was ""myself"" again. It is an experience which is unique and very personal. I hope that everybody will have the chance to get the treatment which helps them and removes fears."
depression,f6ugtqv,t1_f6ufkme,1573162709.0,"I can't easily get into that positive headspace. I only have positive thoughts if I consume psychedelics.
Most of the time it's the emotion which causes a negative headspace. My body hurts, I can't even define this hellish pain. I don't know which thought causes such pain. I feel mentally and physically blocked by a higher sense of being which forces me to do things which harm me and it's getting out of control. Especially suicidal thoughts."
