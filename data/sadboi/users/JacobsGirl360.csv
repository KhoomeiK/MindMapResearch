Some useful advice I've received is to take things very, very slow.  Moving slow can prevent us from getting into a potentially bad situation.   We tend to be attracted to unhealthy/destructive people... not always, but left unchecked, we can be.  Just take everything in and make sure there is no abuse or scary behavior. 

You mention becoming obsessed and feeling like you want to get married.  I've found some success with keeping people at ""arms length"" until you are sure you know and trust them enough not to hurt you.  That means not rushing into something like moving in together after a few weeks.  Not being together 24 hours a day.  Not texting every minute.   Just take it slow until you're feeling more comfortable.  If you feel those obsessive feelings coming on, take a step back and do some hobbies or hang with some non romantic friends."

adultery,ff4e30x,t1_ff25i3r,1579561421.0,"Yes it's a good sign.  I'm torn though.  On one hand I feel like I need more physical/emotional time with AP.  On the other hand, after my abusive marriage,  I wouldn't want someone too close to me - for example living with me or being around too much.  I guess I can't have my cake and eat it too."

BPD,fesm6q7,t3_eqh9sj,1579366697.0,"I also don't have any desire to eat while I'm depressed and it has led to weight loss in the past.  I don't see it as self harm though, just loss of appetite."
adultery,feelbs0,t1_feeibgr,1579036074.0,"It's funny. My AP's culture is also so much different than Western culture.  Yesterday I mentioned I wanted to get a tattoo on my abdomen changed (it has my ex-husband's name) but AP says absolutely not because it would be inappropriate for me to have a tattoo artist touching me there. 

I truly feel for my AP's wife too.  I believe she was traumatized in their home country due to war and unthinkable things.  The sort of PTSD she has makes it impossible for her to be the loving wife AP needs.  I know it's not her fault,  and I struggle with it.  But I'm in no way forcing him to cheat, and he shouldn't be destined to unhappiness for the rest of his life. 

I've met AP's wife a couple times and I suspect she might even know we're together.  She will barely look at me and won't speak to me unless I address her.

I'm sure your AP's wife's family would make his life miserable if he was caught cheating.  Some religions and cultures are so rigid.  He is blessed to have you to bring that happiness into his life he might not otherwise have.

Edit: Sorry for the long reply.  I think I needed to vent! Have a great day and best of luck with your AP."
adultery,feehpq1,t1_fedvprz,1579033976.0,"You sound like my AP! His wife repeatedly refused sex with him until he stopped asking.  Now I'm getting it from him and, dang, his wife was crazy for passing him up!"
adultery,feeh9xd,t1_fedpied,1579033726.0,"Can relate.  My AP comes from an Asian country.  He's from an older generation where you stay with your spouse no matter what.  On the flip side, cheating is very common in his culture and the main wife is expected to ""just look the other way"". He even suggested having a child together as it's no big deal in his culture.  TBH I wouldn't want to be his main wife as our cultures are so different and surely he would cheat on me.  I do love him though and be his for as long as he desires me."
adultery,feefjdm,t3_eomsf1,1579032715.0,"I went through something similar.  He went from texting every day to maybe once a week.  When I let him know I needed more, he was hurtful with his words - purposefully or not.  I realized I needed an AP that was more involved with me.  I slowly stopped responding to AP#1 and faded out of his life.  This worked fine because he wasn't putting much energy in the relationship,  so why shouldn't I put the same amount into him?  I ended up finding an AP who is much more involved and what I need."

BPD,feb5nw8,t1_feb40uk,1578955675.0,"I can totally relate. My close friends have their own lives - family,  significant others, work - so it's hard to spend time.  Plus for years I couldn't have people over the house due to my ex's anger and paranoia, and I lost touch with most friends.  Now that I'm suddenly desiring companionship,  there is no one around."
BPD,feahqve,t3_eo3rtr,1578948942.0,">The most regular cause of dissatisfaction for me is that he goes to bed really early in order to get a good night sleep to prevent anxiety during his working day (he works a stressful job). 

It sounds like objectively you are on top of this.  You understand he needs to sleep to feel less anxious at work the next day.  

If your best friend came to you and explained she was having the same situation with her boyfriend,  you would probably explain to her that sleep is a basic need and she need not take it personally.  

Try focusing on the objective reason for sleep rather than the feelings of abandonment. Remind yourself of the great times you've had together and the love he's shown. Letting him sleep guilt-free is a way to show your love and appreciation. ‚ù§"
BPD,feag1lz,t1_fe6tj2j,1578948214.0,"My therapist actually told me that people with cluster-B personality disorders ""aren't supposed to be in relationships"".  That's such a huge commitment to ask of someone... to not be in a relationship for our entire lives. üòî

I've tried to improve because I admit my relationships have been dysfunctional (not entirely my doing but I'm not perfect either). So far an ""arm's length"" type of relationship is working for me, where we're not living together enmeshed but occasionally seeing each other while talking daily."
politics,fbn2bvc,t1_fblptze,1576991800.0,"Not playing ""the devil's advocate"" (no pun intended)... but I grew up in a very conservative Christian denomination, and still attend church with the fam.

I never once saw a copy of ""Christianity Today"" floating around.  Not even among the church leaders.  Many of the evangelicals I know don't actively follow or read the news, but get their information from the pastor or other church members.  And the pastor of our very large church actively vouches for Trump from the pulpit...

I'm just saying we shouldn't get our hopes up.  CT isn't representative of evangelicals and there isn't going to be a ""revolution"".  90%+ will still support Trump."
