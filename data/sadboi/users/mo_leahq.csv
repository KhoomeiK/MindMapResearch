he showed me picture of old him , he was typical femme gay skinny with he told me he had femme voice and acted & walked in femme way,his family is rich so he afforded all these things, he told me he started by gaining weight then started going to gym 6 days every week & worked out for 2 hours so he developed muscle he look now like hot athlete guy , he still goes to gym but 4 days a week, he even he told me he took voice classes to deal with him femme voice despite that his voice still femme but not obvious of course,i think the only thing that didn't change about him is that he is submissive bottom,
I really feel bad that he had to go through all this, but he still connected with his femme side he do drag he is interested in fashion & makeup , and when he is with me or in safe place
He don't hesitate to show her femme part from talking in femme way & acting in femme way & putting some little makeup & sometimes wearing woman clothes but i am ok with that, the funny thing after all transformation he did women started to hit in him."
