Just simple things like making sure you take a walk once a day, take care of yourself and do things you love. For example I‚Äôm a real Astro-nerd so the last few days I‚Äôve been trying to get back into it, after realising I‚Äôd basically forgotten who I was.

My therapist recently has been really drilling into me to get some light exercise, just like a walk, because your brain just gets blooded with cortisol when you‚Äôre facing traumas again, and it screws your memory too, so a little exercise apparently counteracts it a bit"

Just make sure you pay attention in the coding and stats style classes! 

Another option can be software developer/ engineer. However, in my experience at least, with a physics degree these are more difficult to get into, because they would normally prefer a computer science person. 

However both of these will likely need coding experience! I‚Äôm unsure where you‚Äôre from so what the uni system is like, but I‚Äôd recommend seeing if you can take some software related modules alongside the physics ones. Otherwise if your degree is more set, I know that some do a physics with a year in computer science degree.

However, she needs to be on her meds while doing EMDR, because it does get worse at first and it is tough, like I get really weird dreams too constantly. 

Do you have any idea if she feels any less shitty about the ‚Äòtarget memories‚Äô when she thinks about them? These are the memories you start off with when you start the EMDR session. If they‚Äôre easier to think about now than before it‚Äôs a sign that it‚Äôs working."

Gin,flhwy23,t1_flf0t7y,1585171045.0,"Thought you‚Äôd appreciate an update - I‚Äôve just tasted it, the cardamom is bit overpowering so I took that out and added more juniper, orange peel and a tiny bit more coffee - you could just about taste the coffee and it went well, but I thought a little more maybe nice! 

In general, how long should gin be infused for if making it the bathtub way?"

Ah thank you - yeah I thought afterwards that making the gin first would‚Äôve been a better idea because the coffee may dominate the flavour a bit much - but nothing I can do now, hopefully it turns out well... maybe I‚Äôll try the amaro mele sometime!"
Gin,flezqln,t1_flex94t,1585094867.0,"Thank you - you really seem like you know your stuff, I‚Äôm impressed! Honestly thank you for all this information you‚Äôve taught me loads! 

I had a screw it moment and decided to add some coffee into my batch - not too much but I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll give it a little hint, I‚Äôll let you know how it turns out! And if it‚Äôs not great I‚Äôll just have to make another batch ;)"
