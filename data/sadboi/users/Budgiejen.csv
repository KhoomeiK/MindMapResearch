Every night I make a list of what I want to do the next day. For example, tomorrow the exterminator is coming, I have a therapist appointment and I need to call my pain doc because I’m flaring again. Then I kind of keep ideas in my head about what I’d like to do. Right now that idea is mostly putting laundry away. It’s likely the laundry won’t get put away before I can get in to the doctor. But that’s ok. I’ll put it on tomorrow’s list. That’s basically what I do a lot of nights. I just say, “I didn’t accomplish this thing, but that’s ok. I’ll put it on tomorrow’s list.”  

Eventually the laundry will get put away. And if I had to guess, my tuesday list that I make tomorrow night will just be go to work and wash some dishes. Because by then I’ll be out of spoons. Literal spoons. And if things go well, I’ll get that laundry put away. 

I know that things don’t always go as planned. I try to keep my goal list short. That way it’s easier to achieve. And fewer things to potentially carry over to the next day. But you know, if I have to carry it over, it’s no big deal. It’ll get done."
