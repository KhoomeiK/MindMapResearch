Is there a season starting next week?"
AnthemTheGame,fp1kkol,t3_gajmfu,1588238712.0,"With a GTX 1060, you should target 1080p medium. 8gb is a huge limitation as the game regularly uses 10GB RAM. In your case, the stutter may be when the game is trying to use the virtual memory from hard drive. Even having a super fast SSD still introduces stutters as its not as fast as RAM.

For me, disabling image sharpening options in Nvidia/AMD settings did the trick on a RX 5700. Give that a try."
AnthemTheGame,fp1k5sc,t3_garcnp,1588238289.0,"I have the same processor and a RX 5700 and was having similar issues after a recent driver update.

I went into the AMD settings and disabled the image sharpening feature for this game and it worked like a breeze. Mine is at 1440p and settings on high and its about 50 to 70fps on a freesync monitor.

So, try disabling any features like sharpening, DLSS etc in settings. I did it just for this game specifically so it doesnt affect other games. You can also do the same."

Don‚Äôt worry about a future that may never come. Yes, it may sure happen but like last time, you will sail over it I am sure. You are only 40, so why worry so much. Loads of years to work and pay off anything. Good luck, have patience and believe in yourself my friend üëçüèª"
galaxys10,fl3lev4,t3_fm6rde,1584789427.0,My S10 had dropped and same thing had happened. Had to replace the screen. Its damaged the backlights.

I also have the multitasking windows super laggy."
galaxys10,fb7lfe7,t3_ebf00v,1576593378.0,Updated S10 to UI 2.0 but the multitasking screen is laggy as hell along with the app drawer. Feels like a phone from 5 years back.
Amd,f9y41fg,t1_f9y1iu1,1575723030.0,Do you undervolt the card or run stock fan curves?
Amd,f9xttdq,t1_f9qy129,1575718139.0,"I tried this card yesterday but its loud as hell. My reference RX 5700 reaches about 39db at the edge of the case whereas this reaches about 45-46db. Is it that the 5700XT is hotter than the 5700?

Also, tried undervolting but that also pushes the clocks down. Fan curves adjustment does not work in Wattman for the card. What are the settings that everybody else is using?"
buildapcsales,f9nue20,t1_f05yiec,1575490830.0,Whats the fan size on this and how many heatpipes does it have when you see from the side?
Amd,f9nsk6y,t1_f9et56f,1575489966.0,"Whats the size of the fans on these? Is it dual 90mm or dual 100mm fans?

DestinyTheGame,ewuhcaz,t3_cq250p,1565781120.0,Absolutely agree. Making the game look boring unless you pay for is not something anyone would want.
xboxone,euugk8o,t3_bnfa4u,1564043790.0,"It looks like the Xbox still thinks you are connected to the TV and hence the option to select 4K and HDR.

Because of that the Xbox may be pushin out HDR signal to a SDR monitor and that is messing up the colors and contrast.

You need to do a full cycle of the Xbox after connecting it to the new monitor, so that it recognises the monitor and displays SDR accordingly."
