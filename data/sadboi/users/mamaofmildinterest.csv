mentalhealth,fq861k1,t3_gh5k0z,1589159223.0,"My mom died a long time ago, but even before that was she was an alcoholic, abusive and neglectful. I never understood how people can carry a beautiful life for 9 months and then just throw them away, abusive them, manipulate them and any other cruel thing they can think of.

I have a daughter now and the only thing I can think about is loving her, protecting her and giving her the best chance at life to be a good, successful person. 

Sending lots of virtual hugs and love to anyone hurting today."
Catholic,fp48v09,t3_gb5aob,1588294018.0,"Not a super seasoned Catholic but please take care of yourself! Definitely look into RCIA and find ways to deal with your toxic family, whether that‚Äôs through therapy or cutting them out of your life. God loves you so much and am so happy you‚Äôre hearing His call!"
Parenting,fo1ax5h,t3_g51ewk,1587429359.0,"Yes! Me. All. The. Time. I‚Äôm constantly checking my daughter‚Äôs breathing. I‚Äôve even accidentally woken her up from putting my hand near her nose or putting my hand on her chest to feel movement. 

Glad I‚Äôm not the only one."
CatholicWomen,fnmvd6m,t1_fnhckdk,1587078883.0,"My daughter has been waking up so early as well and with me for the same amount of time. Thanks for linking the video, love seeing Catholic/faith filled you tubers! 

As far as staying sane, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible with motherhood lol! We read a lot and dance a lot. Our days are pretty laid back for the most part. I just try to tire her out so she can take a good nap.

But you are doing an amazing job mama! I‚Äôm praying for you."

CatholicWomen,fmjo3au,t1_fminuk3,1586134242.0,"Yes! I‚Äôm in the same boat! I‚Äôm so used to going out and about with my little one. But I think this has became the Lent we didn‚Äôt know we needed. I‚Äôve been consistently praying the rosary and Chaplet of divine mercy, so it has helped!

Not gonna lie though, I cannot wait to visit my favorite coffee shops and hug all my loved ones!"
