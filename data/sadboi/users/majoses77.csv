And as far as communism being able to fight climate change, it is much more equipped to do it than capitalism, as the government would have complete control over the economy, so all the money necessary could be allocated to these infrastructure projects and investments in creating these new industries."

LateStageCapitalism,fnz5qaq,t1_fnz4ubq,1587386768.0,"I am gonna have to disagree with you there actually, I believe there are a ton of people who want to do something about climate change but they just are stuck voting for democrats hoping that they will do something about it. They don’t know yet but voting for the lesser of two evils or simply raising awareness through protests isn’t the only thing that they can do. I think that if we show them that there is another option then they will jump at the chance. Especially if we find a way to provide a service to them, like the black panthers free breakfast program. They will see that we actually do things materially and they will become interested in our party. Also, raising awareness through protests is good, but we need a disciplined party organization in order to really coordinate well and divide responsibilities and pressure politicians to do things."
LateStageCapitalism,fnz5crb,t1_fnz4ubq,1587386490.0,"I’m gonna have to disagree with you there that it would be too difficult to bring that many people together. I believe that many many people are dying to do something about climate change, they just as stuck not knowing what else to do than to vote for the democrats hoping that they will do something about it. I think if we show them we mean business and actually perform an act that shows that we aren’t just all talk, or provide a service to the community, kind of like the black panthers and the free breakfast program, the people will like us and we will gain their trust and they will see us as a friend of the people and join us if they are already interested in saving the planet. I’m still thinking of services we could provide or things we could do fundraising for. But I really think that people want to do something about climate change but like I said are stuck voting for the lesser of the two evils and don’t know that that isn’t the only option, they don’t have voting for democrats as their only option. A lot of people go to protests as well for example and organize in other ways. I believe that simply raising awareness through protests also isn’t going to do anything. We need to build a disciplined party centered around climate change to actually do something meaningful. Awareness is cool and all but it doesn’t accomplish anything."
biology,fnz4nr9,t1_fnz4lm2,1587385955.0,"I think that we need to re-think the way we have been trying to fight climate change. 

We have for to long been going to protests that never end up changing anything on their own and doing things to “raise awareness”, finding ourselves simply screaming into the void without making any meaningful change. We cannot rely on the current two party system in the USA to fight climate change; the deck is stacked against us and it is realistically never going to happen. We need to make a radical change in strategy.

 We need to form an organization that has its only goal to be fighting climate change, and it needs to be set up in the structure of a vanguard party with democratic centralism (I am not set in stone on this totally, feel free to challenge me). It needs to function like a disciplined political party. 

The reason I think this structure would be effective is because, although I am not here to talk politics, the vanguard party in the Marxist-Leninist tradition is an extremely effective TOOL to an end that has been proven throughout the 20th and 21st centuries to be useful for accomplishing the goal of getting members, educating people, keeping members active, having a coherent and well organized leadership, dedicated cadres, etc. 

It is important that this party ONLY focus on climate change because the more things that we focus on, the more chance there will be for people to disagree with us. So, contrary to what some of you are, and I have been thinking for years, we cannot just work with a regular communist party. This is simply because climate change is such an important issue that we cannot take the risk of someone disagreeing that would have otherwise worked with us. 

This kind of thing is incredibly important if we are going to try to organize the people who already agree that climate change is an important issue. It also makes it so that we don’t need to have ALL members spending all of their time working on this, and it makes the best use of each member that we have through dedicated cadres. 

Once again, I am not saying this would be a communist party, I am saying that we can learn from the STRUCTURE of the party and it’s usefulness as a TOOL. I think this will really be a game changer because this Leninist TOOL is extremely effective and without the bad press and connotation that communism gets, the actual structure and methods can be very useful for something else: fighting climate change. 

So anyways, I believe that we need to have this political party focused on only climate change to have local chapters anywhere we can get more than two members and they can establish a local chapter. There need to be representatives from each chapter in a region to reside over each region as well as representatives from each region that form the central committee and elected general secretary. 

I believe that the most effective democratic structure is democratic centralism, wherein every member gets to voice their concerns and argue for something without fear of reprisals and then everyone votes on the course of action, and the result is binding: everyone, having had the chance to discuss with the group, must now abide by the decision of the majority. This is the most democratic form of things in a party in my opinion. 

Democratic centralism makes it so that the party is much more effective at carrying out its decisions; people will abide by what the majority has decided and do their duties, for example a member may be instructed to moderate a social media organ for the party and try to really engage with at least 10 people that day. 

We need to use this party to gain influence and even run candidates in local elections and even state elections; not because we will necessarily win or be able to accomplish much in office, but because we will draw attention to our cause. This is similar to what Leninist vanguard parties do, however we would be doing it for climate change. Eventually, we will have enough influence to where we could potentially get some policy made or at least influence the government to based on the people’s will. This is different from other forms of organizing because unlike the Green Party for example, it is an effective vanguard, and also it is just more organized and targeted than other forms of organizing. On top of this, we will fundraise for multiple causes and give back to the community, this will make the masses see us more positively and see that we are a party of substance and action. We can really do many things towards our goal, I would love to hear any ideas. 

Anyways, one thing that I think we need to try to get the government to do is a sort of Green COVID-19 Stimulus Plan. 

What needs to be done is the massive mobilization of the millions of people who have lost their jobs among other specialized workers that would be needed in order to construct a large high speed rail network in the USA across the country. Importantly, within each state a high speed rail should be constructed and especially and most importantly within each city there should be a rail or subway network built.

This is a massive infrastructure project, the biggest in the history of the USA no doubt; however, we see the government pumping trillions of dollars now into the economy to try to stabilize it due to the pandemic, and climate change is so much more important that it is not even comparable. 

This would create so many jobs and likely they will be lifetime jobs. Even though it seems daunting, it is NECESSARY. Even if all of it cannot be done now, just starting on the construction of the high speed rail across the country (or in each city, whichever is actually easier or would reduce emissions the most) should be done. 

In addition to the above, or perhaps instead of it, huge amounts of capital and labor should be invested in the production of many electric car factories and anything else that is necessary for their production or use. This would create a ton of good jobs, and with the huge government investment and huge production capacity, it would make electric cars much cheaper than they are now, or at least the government can subsidize their production so as to make them affordable. Their export would also make us money and the center of one of the most important industries in the world. 

The investment in the building of other sources of renewable energy where possible and research and development as well would be important. 

I know what you are thinking: this is so prohibitively expensive that it is impossible. I say you know what; 200 years ago they said that you would never set foot on the moon. I say we need to TRY. Do not just look at a task and think that it will not be possible. We don’t have a lot of options. And you know what? With this COVID-19 induced mass unemployment, this is a good time to have a massive infrastructure projects and developments of new industries; we can train unemployed workers so that they can work on the infrastructure and in these industries. 

Actually that is important separately; we need to try to get the government to offer free training for the unemployed so that they could work in the construction of high speed rail, electric cars, renewable energy, etc.

So what do you think about my idea? I know that it sounds like a pipe dream, but personally I fully believe that I’m going somewhere and I’m gonna do everything I can to try to get the ball rolling. 

Please let me know what you think and any suggestions/criticisms and if you think it’s a good idea, you should PM me!"

Wealth is created though a process in which surplus value is extracted: the workers do their job during which profits are created, then the capitalist receives the profits and pays the worker just enough to survive and the difference is called the surplus value. So actually labor creates all wealth. Also, if the people owned the business instead of the capitalist, then they would literally work for themselves and create the wealth. 

I have tried to have a civil discussion with you but you are constantly ignoring my question. How would you fight climate change if you were not to do what I propose? I literally am beginning to question your ability to even answer the question as you have consistently ignored it."

Second off, democratic centralism is literally just that people all discuss something then everyone votes and the vote is binding. There is nothing related to dictators at all. I think you are focusing the wrong thing; democratic centralism is a way of voting essentially, and I’m talking about using a vanguard structure and democratic centralism for a political purposes. This has nothing to do with communism. A vanguard party does not have to be communist. 

Democratic centralism is definitely not the consolidation of power into a single individual. That is literally not what it is.

DebateCommunism,fnz2x8b,t1_fnz252m,1587384533.0,"I completely believe that we can only fight climate change through having a communist revolution and then using the planned economy to do these things. What I am arguing for is that for now, alongside actual communist vanguard parties of which I am a member of one, we need to also have a vanguard party that is not associated with communism at least not in name and only focusing on climate change as a major issue simply because if we focus on more then we will not get as many members due to anti-communist propaganda and biases. 

The goal of the vanguard party to fight climate change is not to be the ultimate thing that fights climate change, that will be the actual communist vanguard. The climate vanguard would harness the power of the people who want to fight climate change now but don’t want to organize with communists. In fact, through this climate vanguard, we could likely get most of the members to join the actual communist vanguard. But we would be fools not to harness the power of the people who aren’t communists or sympathetic to them.

So this organization needs to try to grow as fast as possible and it will be able to accomplish many things before it reaches the limit of its usefulness, then it can very easily be voted by its members to adopt the platform of the PCUSA on other issues or to merge into that party. It can’t possibly hurt to develop this party especially because it could get tons of people involved who would never organize with a communist party and it also can just be merged one day once it lives out its usefulness.

If these infrastructure projects and investments in new industry were done, then people would have cheaper transportation and be able to quickly travel the country and their cities without pollution the environment nearly as much.

People are stuck only being able to complain to everyone else about how the world is getting g destroyed; I want to show them that there is a way to do something about it other than just hoping that some politician will actually do something about it. I sincerely believe that people want to do something about it and that there are actually many more people that want to fight climate change than you think. So I believe that this would give them that opportunity.

Also I don’t simply think that redistribution of wealth will accomplish this. What would be beneficial from having a communist society would be the ability to plan the economy fully and for people to not be at the whim of billionaires who only care about making money through destroying the environment. The communist government, if the USA were to have a revolution for example, would have the IMMENSE resources of the most developed country in the world at its disposal to make these investments in new industries and technologies as well as infrastructure projects because it doesn’t have to be a decision made simply off of if it is profitable or not; the decision could be made simply because it improves the lives of the people and the world and makes sense from a long term planning perspective."

I’m not talking about a communist vanguard or an authoritarian vanguard that people like to be irrationally afraid of; I’m talking about a literally proven effective method of organizing.

TopMindsOfReddit,fnyzri1,t1_fnyyqtp,1587381657.0,"First off, I don’t plan to associate this organization with the Bolsheviks because most people would not know that what we are doing would be called democratic centralism. 

Also, I sympathize with the bolsheviks; they were an inspiration. They led the first successful communist revolution and survived for most of a century and inspired many liberation struggles around the world that imitated their structure and methods and then were actually successful. A lot of people like to shit on the Leninists, but you have to look at how much they improved Russia after the revolution. 

Now matter what you say, you can not possibly say that life was better under the Czar. Also, I invite you to ignore the politics, but to look at the successful strategy; the bolsheviks won and the liberation struggles that copied their methods were also successful, from the Vietnamese to the Black Panthers. So regardless of what you think of the bolsheviks, you have to at least say they were successful in what they did. 

I really think that we should use these people that have already been organizing on the left of the Democratic Party, but I strongly believe that we should not operate within the Democratic Party as a whole and it would have to be separate. Additionally, I personally believe that the structure of the party needs to be fundamentally different to a regular political party; a vanguard party is proven to be extremely effective and democratic. That is why I believe we need a new organization. We don’t need to start it from scratch necessarily, as we should definitely get to get as many people who have already been organizing to join as possible. 

I simply think that a grassroots organization like this operating outside of the mainstream parties is the key; I don’t think that the fact it may not win elections is important; it has a different modus operandi."

I’d say the US has been pretty successful so far and they have been taxing corporations; at one point having corporate taxes close to 70% under Eisenhower.

That is only one method that it would engage in, with the ultimate goal to be to gain more power until it can pressure the government even further. Likely this party would through its very nature be easily turned into a party that could actually take power eventually by force, although hopefully it doesn’t come to that and that would only be once it has enough power; it would likely be driven underground before it got that powerful and be a guerrilla.

Yea I believe that actually it is not population size that is the problem necessarily like you said it is the way that we live in the west; in Africa they don’t have nearly the same level of greenhouse gas emissions and they have a ton of people. I agree that sending some wolves to the billionaires would be effective lol. 

I am trying to focus on this as something that can be done now, however when conditions are better, obviously an actual Leninist vanguard would be the best way to combat climate change, as a government run by the masses for the masses would actually care about doing all it can to fight climate change and invest in these infrastructure projects and industries.

I want to convince them that we need a party that is solely dedicated to climate change. We definitely will be using the current economic crisis/pandemic for the most part when deprogramming people. 

I believe that obviously we need a Marxist-Leninist party, but recently I have come to believe that we need a separate political party that is only focused on climate change.

Also I  think that even with pressure from institutional investors, they won’t be doing nearly as much or as drastic of measures as necessary in order to combat it. 

For example I think one of the most important possible things we could do is to have a sort of COVID-19 stimulus plan/green new deal where we undertake immense infrastructure projects to give people jobs where we work in establishing more renewable energy plants as well as and extremely importantly high speed trains that spread the nation, and even more importantly, train systems in each state and city.

Tell him that you are going to cook you guys meals for the next month.

scientology,fnxqsq0,t1_fnxodbw,1587344396.0,"Yeah I am not trying to hide that from people though, I am asking because I want to focus specifically on climate change and not communism, I asked on the communist subreddits because I thought they might have some advice because they also fight an uphill battle just to help people find the truth and I also wanted to give them the advice to help them too. And I couldn’t find that many relevant subreddits. 

Like I said I’m not trying to hide anything. I can’t explain my point without directly talking about how with capitalism or at least the form we have now we will never get anything meaningful done in the fight against climate change. The first thing I would do is explain this contradiction. 

I don’t care what people believe, only what they do. So me personally I am a communist, but I don’t like to say that I subscribe to any one ideology. I’m not trying to brainwash anybody into being communists, my actual goal is climate change. So all I care about it getting people to actively organize to fight climate change. 

I believe that we need a disciplined political party with democratic centralism that is focused 100% on fighting climate change, literally nothing else. That way, we don’t have to worry about people not jointing because we’re communists, or because we believe in abortion, etc. people will just see us as being the party who is gonna GET SHIT DONE. Also people will discuss issues freely and then vote and then that vote is binding, so people will be more active and dedicated to carrying out the tasks they have been assigned, The struggle would be constant. Also, it would make coordination easier around the whole country and within each state. 

The reason that it needs to be a political party is because usually what people do for climate change is just taslk about it, complain about it, go to limited protests, and that’s usually it. We can’t just “raise awareness” and the Democrats and Republicans are not gonna do anything meaningful; seriously, we are almost too late so we need to do some drastic things. We have been injecting trillions of dollars into the economy due to coronavirus, a much much smaller threat. Climate change is going to destroy the world. So we need to treat it like that. 

One idea I have is that we need to have a climate change/coronavirus green new deal type thing where we have millions of people who are out of work now due to coronavirus and others to build high speed trains across the whole US as well as normal trains within most US cities. This is urgently needed and we absolutely need to start now. If we could replace cars with trains that would be literally amazing."

I am just trying to understand the underlying psychological mechanisms behind “deprogramming” and not even everything just whatever is possible to be learned form and applied. 

I wouldn’t be leaving my preferred solutions as secret.

ClimateOffensive,fnw1cko,t1_fnuif4z,1587309416.0,"Thank you! I appreciate it! I am actually more interested to a degree in “deprogramming” people who already do believe that climate change is a major issue; I think that there are already a huge amount of people who already believe in it but they are brainwashed by the dominant ideology, believing that simply raising awareness and the two-party system/capitalism can solve climate change. 

I am not necessarily trying to argue for any specific economic system but I believe that they need to be convinced of the importance of organizing with a party dedicated to fighting climate change as its central goal, rather than as one of the many issues (and not even that important at all) of the current parties. 

What do you think about that? In organizing, you can get so much more work done with a dedicated party than you can with a ton of people who aren’t well organized. I think that we could get a lot done with the amount of people that already believe in climate change. 

Also I came across a thing called the Ideological Turing Test where you can test to see if you are just an ideological robot who responds with preprogrammed responses. You are supposed to talk with someone with opposing views and try to get them to believe that you share their viewpoint; if you can fool them, you pass the test. I was thinking that we could, if a person seems to be doing so, we could have a third person who agrees with us and doesn’t know that they have opposing views to talk to them and have the other person do the test with them. Maybe them realizing they are an ideological robot would open their mind? Link below:

ClimateOffensive,fnvzzks,t1_fnuhd9d,1587308599.0,"Thanks! I am actually mainly interested in “deprogramming” people that already believe that climate change is a major issue; I want to “deprogram” (for lack of a better word) the ideology that the current two parties, political system, and economic system will not be possible to be used to fight climate change and they instead need to organize with a specific dedicated party type structure, as I believe that without an actual party structure, the movement will only amount to “spreading awareness” and will not accomplish anything meaningful. Do you see what I mean? 

For example, and I do not believe this by the way it is just an example my friend gave me, after 9/11 1/3 of the US population thought that it was some kind of conspiracy by the government and there were a lot of people talking about it and “spreading awareness” but because there was not a dedicated party for uncovering the conspiracy and holding those actually responsible accountable, they just kind of petered out over time. However, for example, huge issues like extreme wealth inequality have been solved only by very well organized party structures instead of just raising awareness, as even if the majority of people are against it, it won’t have anything done about it unless there is a very well organized party. Now I know those aren’t great examples though but I think you know what I mean."
