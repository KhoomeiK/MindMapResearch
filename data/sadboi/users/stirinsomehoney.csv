depression_help,fm9vnbs,t3_ftrs6v,1585877601.0,"If it feels right to feel shitty, then just allow yourself to do it. Don‚Äôt try and fake happy all the way through, cause I know I sometimes need to let myself have a really bad day. Feel it all the way through, from the negativity to the moments where you can‚Äôt stop crying, because once you get over those waves then a better wave of emotions might come in time. It‚Äôs very difficult right now, and we can only hope it ends sooner than later. Try not to look at the news so much either. If you find yourself easily upset but also obsessed with checking the news, ask yourself ‚Äúdo I want to look at this and feel even worse? Or give myself some space to clear my head instead of filling it up again‚Äù. Good luck from a fellow depressed person behind the screen. I believe in you! I believe in all of us!!"
