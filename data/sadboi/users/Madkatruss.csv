It would be better than my apartment situation where I could risk even having my shoes stolen for leaving them outside. I don’t really think I have an issue with distancing from my parents.

My floor is a low risk floor because of the precautions they take when admitting patients from labor and delivery, but the fact that I deal with up to 16 people per day, plus their significant others and infants, just makes me nervous that I’m gonna get it and spread it to my parents. That’s the only thing really holding me back."

NoStupidQuestions,fpdt8of,t3_gbpvz2,1588533761.0,"My mental health is declining because I am quarantining alone. I had the police called on me two weeks ago because I said some concerning things. My therapist even recommended that I go home-home. I work on a postpartum unit that strictly forbids patients with any signs of covid until they are tested negative, due to the presence of newborns on the floor. I take all necessary precautions when working with patients, disinfect everything right after my shower after work, and clean my scrubs as soon as possible. My parents have just received my medication in the mail and I have no choice but to get it from them today. But because of the state of my mental health and therapist’s recommendation I was thinking about staying. It’s a hard decision because I may never know if I’m sick with it, but I also am concerned that my mental health is going to get worse and I know this is going to take up to 2 years to go away.

Or am I so without identity I try to present myself that way? Or do I just like to appear that way? I would love to not have a favorite person for like five seconds just to figure all this out.
