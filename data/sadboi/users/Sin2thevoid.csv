entitledparents,fqmjeht,t3_gjodff,1589478422.0,Idk where you live but try using an Amazon locker in the future. That way it isn't delivered to your house and you can't be questioned about your purchases!
nintendo,fnvc75k,t3_g3ptch,1587287791.0,I'm a nurse and I have seen the community come together to rally around us and support us ðŸ’œ
traderjoes,fjs044m,t1_fjp8eox,1583592166.0,They sell the ice cream by itself too. It's called coffee bean blast
depression,fidf827,t1_fibcc07,1582366324.0,It feels like an endless cycle. With meds I stay up longer but I still relapse sometimes and it sucks
depression,fidefsr,t1_fiaovlu,1582366092.0,Literally everything in my life is improving at the moment and I still feel like shit
depression,fide8hb,t1_fiaa1y5,1582366035.0,Thank you. I take meds now and I definitely have felt worse but this is how it always starts. I am actively trying to get through it and I am also a fan of CBT!
traderjoes,fi91a1n,t1_fi903k0,1582253183.0,I grilled them on a charcoal grill
millionairemakers,fbk929k,t3_edq7ov,1576946664.0,Here's to making history and closing out the decade!

mildlyinfuriating,f3a0e5v,t1_f376xmg,1570759116.0,I've had a nightmare about this many times. I had no idea those were real. I just looked up pictures and it's worse than in my dreams
apolloapp,f11tkdc,t3_d7iop7,1569130355.0,Congrats on the app! It's much needed and I can't wait to try it with my new Mac ðŸ¤ž
spicy,f0h61px,t3_d4bhns,1568613748.0,I can't eat the regular ones anymore because I love these ones so much! They are inconsistent in spicy though. Some bags are way spicier than others.
delusionalcraigslist,ew59lua,t3_cms3h8,1565130958.0,Legends say these were originally white
Nurse,ew39fol,t3_cmj612,1565068807.0,"I directly call them out on their behavior and let them know it is inappropriate. For the most part, they already know it is inappropriate and simply do not care. Once they cross that line, I keep my interactions to the minimum of what I need to do to satisfy my job requirements and no small talk or extra time with them. Sometimes nurses will bring another staff member in with them to ease the discomfort, this usually helps. We have also called security but I have never seen that make an impact."

traderjoes,eu6g1ie,t1_eu6e1y9,1563499490.0,Same. I hope they keep this one!
traderjoes,eu0kahc,t1_eu0bf8m,1563349578.0,I am a spicy lover but I would put it at medium-hot for the average person. The rice has no spicyness to it at all so that helps mellow it out.
Nurse,etmw823,t3_ccgch9,1562970140.0,I have the regular Litman III and have had no issues. People who have borrowed it have complimented it so I haven't ever felt like it was inadequate
Nicegirls,eqf2m50,t3_by8kyh,1560014063.0,I saw this guy on my way back to Daytona earlier this week!
aww,eplj7uq,t3_bv1jak,1559296984.0,Is sharing patient information a *HIPPAW* violation? Lol
Nurse,eog609k,t3_brodra,1558551439.0,I bought a blackout window cling from Amazon because curtains weren't 100% working and I am happy with them. My boyfriend says it's too dark but that's what I was going for
