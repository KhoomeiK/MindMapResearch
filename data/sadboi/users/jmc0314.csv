MobileAL,fi17age,t3_f5w9xy,1582052047.0,I used azalea city movers and they were reasonably priced. Most places charge by the hour and a lot of them have a minimum charge. But azalea city didn’t have that. I feel like it was around $250. Went from a 2 bed apartment in mobile to a house in Semmes.
CleaningTips,fgn3vpz,t1_fgn0o5s,1580937208.0,I agree. I had house cleaners use bleach in a load of laundry and ruined a bunch of my clothes. The company asked for a list of the items with replacement cost and I was reimbursed.
30PlusSkinCare,fggg0ow,t3_ey99j6,1580761096.0,I got kybella a couple of years ago. I had two rounds. It was the most painful injection I’ve ever had in my entire life. My neck swelled up the size of a baseball for weeks. I had huge bruising for weeks. The only reason I went back for the second time was because I already paid for it. The second time wasn’t nearly as painful and the swelling wasn’t as bad. However the results were minimal. If any. I honestly don’t notice a difference. Would not recommend to a friend.

Accounting,fca4zm5,t1_fca3tqd,1577563136.0,"I got my first job as a corporate accountant and it was a lot of corporate AP/high level bookkeeping work. It’s boring sometimes but that’s the training you’re really looking for to be honest. I learned the most just by digging through the GL, learning to post, and researching mistakes. I’ve been working for 8 years, I’m an accounting supervisor now, I have one bookkeeper and we have about 120 accounts we cover. Even now a lot of what I do is AP/AR related. But it’s also problem solving and customer service. What kind of work are you actually wanting to do? Just because you have a CPA doesn’t mean the company won’t make you start at a lower level position and work your way up. You still need real world experience. At my last job I was over a girl with her CPA and masters but I had more years experience. It’s not always the letters behind your name but the integrity of the work you do. Not to deter you from going back to school if that’s really what you want to do. But it doesn’t guarantee a better job in the end."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f6wbl83,t1_f6uyec1,1573222456.0,I would agree with you they are not unbiased. They do have an outpatient program but won’t allow him to participate until he’s done inpatient again. Which just seems bonkers to me.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f6wbg8p,t1_f6uvyd9,1573222347.0,He sees a counselor affiliated with his program. Not an outside one. Although he acknowledges now that he needs to see one. Personally I feel that’s more helpful than another rehab stay. He doesn’t need help being sober - he’s already sober. He needs help learning coping skills.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f6wb9g0,t1_f6tquuw,1573222198.0,He’s doing all those things already. I guess he feels like he’s on the brink of using and is desperate to feel back in control.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f6u81wy,t1_f6u3fio,1573159319.0,My thoughts are he has good insurance that will pay for him to go. So obviously they want another paying customer. But I’m shocked they would let a sober person go to rehab regardless of financial incentive.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f6tsq90,t1_f6trghz,1573153568.0,He is participating in the “continued care” portion of the rehab program he originally went to. They meet once a week with a group counselor. This is outside of his sponsor and regular meetings that he attends. He very much needs to see a psychiatrist outside of this but he keeps making excuses as to why he hasn’t. I would agree with you that this counselor recommended rehab because that’s the only option he has to offer. Not because it’s the best thing to do. Which is what prompted my question in the first place.

What I found works for us is he uses Flonase nasal spray before bed and I have some soft ear plugs. Plus a small desk fan on the floor purely for the noise.
AmItheAsshole,f5m24mi,t3_do8r9e,1572285709.0,NAH. I have the same problem. I need complete darkness and silence to sleep. My boyfriend likes to fall asleep with the tv on. It’s hard to turn my anxiety off to wind down when I know the tv is on and he’s going to fall asleep any second and leave it on. I started trying to wind down my anxiety before I even get in bed. Sleepy time tea helps me. Also melatonin supplements. If you can get CBD oil I’ll sometimes put that in my tea to help fall asleep. I also sleep with ear plugs but that’s mostly for the snore monster lol

homeowners,ez5xqa7,t3_d03ome,1567706568.0,I had the EXACT same problem. I had a 5 year warranty. He came out 4 times to “fix”. It leaked again one month after the warranty was up and I finally paid a real roofer to come out. My advice is to get a lawyer or contact the better business bureau. He has a legal obligation to fix your roof. If the warranty is in the contract he is legally obligated to abide by that. Good luck. I know how frustrating this all is.
