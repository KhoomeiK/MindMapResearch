Screenwriting,es99svc,t3_c6j4iu,1561731109.0,"I'm assuming that the tone of the picture is comedic (?) Making light of a serious subject matter (suicide) is very risky and requires a lot of taste. There seems to be something critically missing from the plot- is finding a ""room"" in the afterlife a highpoint in the timeline or a constant variable driving the plot? Perhaps include a sentence revealing where you intend to go with this concept. Otherwise, I think this story is very appealing and has a lot of potential."

SeriousConversation,er0kv2y,t3_c00zg4,1560418430.0,"I was 20 once. At that age I didn't think anything of my life. I was too busy getting drunk and being high. Alot has changed since then. At one point, I genuinely believed that I didn't deserve the life I was given. Sometimes I still have those thoughts but I'm slowly getting better. These days, I'm more afraid that when/if I do make a full recovery and finally find whatever it is  I've lost... it may be too late. 
Perhaps you feel this way about yourself because you aren't satisified with your current appearance. I'll let you know now that I've never felt truly satisfied with what I see in the mirror either, but I've been taught to work with what I've got. We're our own biggest critics and are prone to missing what others may in fact see very clearly about ourselves. You might not see your own potential right now but don't let that deter you from believing in a better tomorrow. Socialize with strangers whenever you get the chance because those encounters may lead you to new found perspectives and change the way you see, not only yourself, but also the world around you. 
Don't worry, be happy. You got this ü§ü"
