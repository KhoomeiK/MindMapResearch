My friends were very accepting when I ""came out"" after receiving an inofficial diagnosis (by a psychologist. Still trying to get an ~ official diagnosis ~ its complicated) 
My boyfriend is a different story. He claims I am a) not autistic, b) Im seeing things that are not there (not like hallucinations but like imagining symptoms) and c) Im exaggerating my symptoms to fit into my bubble. Im trying to talk That One through.

I think key is explaining that you didn't come up with this diagnosis on your own. A professional who is more informed than both of you, 'gave' that diagnosis to you. You can also explain that Autism presents different in females and that there are more severe forms (or severe presenting forms) than others. Just because you might seem 'normal' doesnt mean you are not autistic. Also mention that the media representation doesnt show the whole picture of autism."

autism,fqarqw3,t3_ghtaog,1589224146.0,"Im actually in the same position as you. I cannot provide you with resources, but the way I am currently trying to get a diagnosis is. I looked for a local autism organisation, which offers consulting (? not sure if it is the right word.) on how to go about a diagnosis. Thanks to the pandemic, this was temporarily only done over phone and mail (catch me doing a happy dance I can write a mail instead of talking to people). I wrote a mail explaining that I was looking for a resource which offers to diagnose adults for autism. I also briefly outlined why I thought I was autistic, as well that I was worried about being taken seriously due to being female. I asked if they knew of places that had experience with adult women.

I got an E-Mail back with an Adress.I contacted them also per mail (who would have guessed), asking if they would be willing to do a diagnosis, what I would need to provide (e.g. a referral from a psychiatrist, old documents). I stated I was only interested in diagnosis, not therapy (because the way is 2h one way)  and why I thought I might be autistic.   
I am still waiting to hear back from them, and will see how that goes. 

**My advice, w/o rambling about myself:** 

I would recommend asking your local autism organisation for doctors expierienced with diagnosis. If you need a referral, you can then still go to your GP or psychiatrist, explain that you think you may have autism (maybe even bring a note so you can explain fully) and if they will refer to, you already have some adresses you can turn to. Maybe your doctor also is not familiar with where to refer you to, then you can tell them where you got the adresses from. 

Fair warning: Depending on your location, it might be very hard to find a doctor near you. You should be aware that you may need to do some travelling for a proper assessment.

I also do not like the generalisations you propose. 
Last but not least an Average IQ of 100 to 129 is false. The average IQ is about 100, with 85% of the Population in the range of 85 - 115 (Standard Deviation)
Depression and Anxiety are actual clinical conditions that are not just ""thoughts about the past and future"" that can be treated by living in the present. At least if you are not just throwing these terms around to describe worrying about the future or moping because everything used to be better. 
Any IQ does not shield you against a mental illness. 
I am not sure what you mean by it being a sign if you suffer like a person of average intelligence, as not everyone with an average intelligence does suffer from these issues. 

Despite all of that I agree that some of the people here have to get of their high horse. Having a certain personality type or an high IQ is no reason to circlejerk that hard."

 I have an IQ of 130+ (i swear I dont want to brag but it seems relevant to disclose) and just because I can think fast does not mean I am in any way superior. I still experience the issues you described for average Intelligence. There is nothing wrong with turning to experts - I assume you mean therapists by this - becaise they in fact know more than me or the average joe, and listening to others opinions is not wrong either - you may just want to critically think about it before adopting this view. 
Your IQ is just a number that is subject to change during your lifetime and deoending on your emotions and only describes a small part of the whole picture of intelligence, and these generalisations are not helpful. 
People with low IQs, high IQs and average IQs can all experience the same issues. What you describe barely describes the surface. Even people with low IQs can worry about the world issues even if they do not grasp the complexity, similar to how people with high IQs can worry about worldwide issues outside of their control."

I think also a point they brought up that it was ""so easy to get it"" and to get diagnosed with ADHD. I got diagnosed as a struggling undergrad (F21)  and it is not easy at all. From first suggestion to acutal diagnosis it took me a year.   
When I started taking Ritalin 10 mg I cried. Because I haven't been this clear in my life and bc it helped my tourettes. Without Ritalin I probably would either have dropped out of school or tried to K\*ll m\*s\*lf. 

Also people who ask you to sell them your pills? Fucking assholes. Even worse those that are asking to get them as ""gifts"". Like all your gonna get is a 20 min rant why just asking this makes you a dick and -50 points on a friendship scale. It makes me SO angry.   
Its a controlled sustance. It is addicting. I have to see my doctor every 2 months (in the beginning every month) to get a pack, I have to have an EEG and EKG every year, and a  full blood test every 3 month. Do they think this is a fucking joke???   


Sorry for the rant this makes me so ANGRY."

Black people and white people see to have a very different experience, especially in America (But what do I know, I am a white european lmao) and I think this evolves into different kinds of humour."
SuicideWatch,foy22lo,t3_ga88av,1588163375.0,"O Honey. I am so sorry you are in so much pain.  I wish I could give you a hug right now, especially because you are in a similar place to where I was at 12. 

And it is SO Cliche I know, but I swear it gets better. I felt the same when I was 12, and I thought I wouldn't make it to 13. I am 21 now. And I swear, I am so thankful that I made it this far, because the good parts of your life are still waiting for you. I promise.  
I know it is really hard. But please hold on. Take it 10 seconds at a time.   


And it kind of helps if you imagine your suicidal thoughts as a 12-year old on XBox going ""KiLl YoUrSeLf"". I find it makes it a lot less scary and easier to push those away.

And please reach out to a teacher, a school counselor, your parents, an uncle or aunt. 

Especially right now with Corona, you could write an E-Mail to someone to reach out and don't have to talk face to face (which is really hard, I know!) It's hard to reach out, but it takes just one second of courage to press send, and I know you have that in you."

Cutters,foxzdaq,t3_ga0n8p,1588161212.0,"My skin in general turns red if I am in a hot shower (i am also really pale)   
My scars that are not completely white (which happens after aprox. 2-3 years) do turn purple or dark red when my arm is under my heart for a long time, or when it is cold. 

I figured the bloodflow in my arms is probably not too good after years of self harm. However, u/OneEyedOneHorned made an interesting point and if you are seeing a doctor I would definitely bring it up."
aspergirls,foxz384,t3_g9ziga,1588160975.0,"If I think it is my time to speak, I tend to start with ""Are you finished?"" or ""Can I say something?"" just to check with the other person.   
I had this problem all my life and will also likely have it, and I find this is much more considerate, bc if they are like ""Oh no I wasn't finished"" you can reply ""Okay, I wasn't sure, please go on""   
I also try to make sure with my friends that they are aware that I do actually have this issue, where it is coming from and I don't have bad intentions."

Ask_Lawyers,forz248,t3_g8y089,1588021015.0,"""Legally Blonde"" if law school movie counts.   
It's not the best movie, (I cant tell you how accurate it depicts american court proceedings as I study in Germany) but its a feel-good one and close to my heart. 

Fun fact, ""What, like it's hard?"" was my Senior quote, back when I didn't even know I wanted to study law"
