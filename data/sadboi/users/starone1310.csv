FriendsOver40,fqwzxl3,t3_gl6weq,1589722403.0,"I used to work, till I got married and ended up taking care of my husband after he had a heart attack, and got hurt and work and became addicted to pain meds. After a few years of dealing with that and domestic violence,  I started divorce and he committed suicide. I WANT to go back to work but my son can not be left alone unsupervised and there are not that many people that I trust to take care of him and those that I do also work. "" True dreams "" are what I call them. I sometimes have dreams and within a few days what happened in my dreams happens in my life. 
Most of the time I am OK with just staying on my mountain, its usually safer for me . Just once in a while.... just once in awhile..I would like it to be different.  My son has friends and I allow him to go places , after a careful screening of where he's going."
