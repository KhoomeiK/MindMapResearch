It sounds like your husband is just trying to show interest and care in your everyday time spent apart, and that's a good, normal spouse thing to do. 

If you're terribly depressed, I'm willing to bet that your husband knows you are. So why don't you try some simple things to re-vamp this situation?

Every day, look for just ONE thing, even if it's small, that you liked about your day & would like to share with him. And then OFFER it to him in conversation - maybe don't even wait for him to ask! Say 'Guess what happened to me today?' or 'I've been waiting to tell you that _____.'

And if you're just having a ShIt day and everything sucks, and he asks how it was, just tell him 'Honey, I'm really depressed today & I'd rather not reflect on my day today. You know how it is sometimes, right?' Create a system with him, where he now understands that sometimes your day was shit & you DONT wanna relive it.

I do this EXACT thing with my husband. I've been clinically depressed for 8 years. He always, always asks about my day. And if my day was hot garbage salad, I just say 'Ugh baby, it was a super shitty day. I'm feeling depressed & don't wanna go over it.' And he says 'okay!' and we go cuddle or make dinner or whatever instead. Hurt feelings averted.
