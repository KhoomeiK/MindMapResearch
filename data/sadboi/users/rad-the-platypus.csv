I also found a tip in attitude that helps me a lot: setting up reward time with particularly anxiety inducing tasks

I've been procrastinating for about two weeks on emailing a former professor of mine to see if she's still willing to be a reference for me. It was freaking me out, even though I know it will probably turn out well, because when I emailed her last year she was happy to do so. Yesterday, I finally sat down to do it. I wrote a basic skeleton email draft, just a mish mash of ideas, and then rewarded myself by setting a time and playing thirty minutes of minecraft. The timer went off, so I told myself that I have the rest of that cave to look forward too, and rewrote most of it. Did another 30 minutes before getting ready for work. ~~I hope to send it out in the next 30 minutes~~ (Edit: I DID THE THING). Minecraft wouldn't work for everyone, or work for me every time because it's so calming and addictive. Going for a walk, playing with the dog, taking time to listen to music, drawing, cooking. Whichever works

I also had to ""climb the wall of awful"" a few days before, and really got to the core of my insecurity about it. Check out ""How to ADHD"" on youtube. She talks about that. And her channel is just so good and has a ton of advice anyways

Took 3 years of struggling and retail hell before I got diagnosed. It's really hard to see my peers go on and get great jobs while I've been stuck. I know I need to be kinder to myself, especially struggling with a very real learning disability.

That said, I have started walking, especially now that I have inserts for high arches and good shoes. That has been nice, and factored in to how I've lost 10 pounds of the 100lbs I need to lose. Also less binge eating. It helps having roommates around. I really wanted to binge yesterday but didn't

CharacterDevelopment,fmvy2yo,t3_fws4ia,1586434674.0,"Neat concept!

So parasites are known for having life cycles with different forms. Some of these stages require parasitism, others they can be free living

 On one side, you have parastic wasps. The female lays eggs in another insect, the eggs hatch, and the larva eat the host, and go on to be free living wasps. 

On another, you have the malaria parasite, which lives inside other organisms it's entire life cycle, just switching between mosquitos and humans via mosquito bites. It depends on hosts for its entire life cycle 

You also have some with just downright wild and complex cycles that have to switch between multiple organisms. They can also affect host behavior. Example: Toxoplasma gondii makes its rat host attracted to cat urine, because it needs to get into a cat to reproduce

So this brings up two questions for you to think about: 

1. What is the life cycle of your species? What are the different stages? 

2. Which stages do they require a host? Which are they free living? 

This could really play into how the species kills and why

I do like the idea of positive mutation, particularly on a longer timescale. Most mutations are harmful, but occasionally you will get a positive one. 

Also, life is more resilient than we think. Especially plant life. As a biochemist, I can tell you from looking into plants more that they are wacky. They don't get cancer in the animal sense. They get cankers, which can't metastasize. And the cam do wacky shit like double the number of chromosomes and just straight up make a new species in one generation. 

Other interesting idea: fungi. They have found fungi in nuclear reactors living off radiation. Which is insane. They straight up switched from consuming other organisms (bacteria probably, since it was a mold) to making their own food, in this case from radiation.

coolguides,fl9y4n5,t1_fl9vxr3,1584972281.0,"Yeah absolutely. There was a lot I didn't notice was bullying at the time. I'm sorry you had to go through that man. I've never been one for the party scene, being an introvert and sensitive to loud music, noise, etc., but as a woman, I can tell you rn that dude was a jerk. Seeing a guy treat someone else that way is a huge turnoff fyi. Actually, seeing anyone treat another person like that is awful. I've also been kinda treated as undesirable, not in the same way, but I get it. And it's made me more socially anxious

That said, you touch on something with that last paragraph I've thought about for a long time. When we are hurt, we can choose how to cope (to an extent), and how we treat others. As I've been healing, I've realized everyone is given a choice: will we choose bitterness? Or will we choose compassion? And this is a choice I've had to make multiple times in my life, sometimes a few times an hour. What I've gone through has been terrible. But I wish to be an agent of healing and support and kindness to others who may or may not have gone through something similar, or are going through their own unique pain. Some days bitterness wins. But more and more, compassion is winning"

When I was in high school, a ""friend"" decided to stop talking to me. Got all of our friends to pick: her or me. They picked her. That just eviscerated me on the inside

And the adults...man the fact that they really didn't do anything. Especially in middle school, when it was more overt.  It's been hitting me even more now in the past few months since I got my adhd diagnosis. No one noticed. All throughout school no one noticed. No one thought ""hey this girl is super disorganized in everything but schoolwork, has a huge range of emotions, extreme anxiety, and can't focus on conversations with peers, maybe we should look into that"""

ADHD,fl1hefb,t3_flswdg,1584729042.0,"bagged salad is life. Also, hardboiled eggs keep in the fridge for up to a week. I made a few earlier and at two with some bagged salad, saved the rest of the salad and eggs for later. Eggs are a great protein source; protein keeps you full for longer. Instant pot or a rice cooker is amazing. Frozen meats too. 

For me, I love flavors and making food taste good. Spices are amazing. So when I do get to cooking, rarely, I try to mix it up a little with different spices and make it a game. Even just throwing some soy sauce on a mixture of rice and previously frozen veggies, or some sriracha on eggs makes a lot of difference. Speaking of eggs, I love putting an over-medium egg over rice and veggies and breaking it to get the yolk to run all over it, or into real southern cheesy grits. It really enhances the taste. I can link the website that I found that goes into detailed instructions on the timing for different types of hardboiled eggs, softboiled, etc, pending your tastes and texture preferences, etc. 

Also apples. I used to snack on all kinds of junk at work, but now I like to buy a bag of apples and just grab one or two, and a pack of peanut butter crackers for protein 

I also recommend ""The Gift of Adult ADHD"" by Lara Honos-Webb. I believe she mentions that she also has adhd, but I don't remember for sure. I want to buy her book ""Brain Hacks"" at some point. It's a big self esteem booster and has great tips

CasualConversation,fl0pqla,t1_fkznxut,1584712939.0,"The best thing you can do is figure out what you enjoy on a basic level, and what interests you. Find a science news website and scan for topics. Be aware that not all are accurate, and watch out for clickbait.  When you find something interesting, look at the wikipedia article. That can direct you to further reading.

YouTube and podcasts are great. Look for neat tedtalks. 

Also figure out how you work best. What kind of environment and people do you like to be around? 

Then contact people. Ask what the field is like in daily life. 

And be aware that everything is subject to change

IsItBullshit,fku2tih,t3_fis8y3,1584541003.0,"Cells have genes that are programmed to initiate what's called apoptosis, or cell death, in the event of severe dna damage in order to prevent cancer. So most will just kill themselves

But if one or more of the genes that initiate cell death is damaged, that's when trouble starts. Particularly over time as more of those genes get damaged. They might be precancerous for awhile 

Usually the immune system can detect it, as others have said, and take care of that cell if it doesn't kill itself. But sometimes they will figure out how to go ""invisible"" to the immune system 

Many people have precancerous cells, which might be what that's referring to, especially with age. That's why people have to get colonoscopies when they're older, and why moles need to be checked"

worldbuilding,fkt1iei,t3_fjfht1,1584503668.0,"I've been toying around with an idea for awhile: a stunningly beautiful post apocalyptic world. An otherworldly plague killed off most of humanity, leaving a few scattered villages a few decades later. Nature has reclaimed most of the world. Also some eldritch and ethereal spirit beings and minor gods are involved 

I have a few character ideas, but I'm not sure of a plot yet. The starting setting will be a seaside fishing town somewhere on the Virginia, NC, SC coast. Or rather, the new coast further inland because climate change. Oysters are flourishing, fisheries have bounced back, water is less polluted 

I'm wondering how native species would bounce back, as well as the effects of invasive species. So wolves will return. But also would pythons from florida spread up? I'm still figuring that out. I want to have some zoo animals escape and thrive. Specifically tigers 

There's a lot of directions this can go
