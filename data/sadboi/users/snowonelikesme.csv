relationship_advice,fqc0gu0,t1_fqbcfiv,1589247581.0,"but you have your own apartment what is stopping you from not making the 5 hour trip to this guy? it seems easy you guys are barely fiancee stage for 6 years you live apart, separate finances, separate families, separate lifestyles essentially there is more connection with a 6-year friend with benefit then you describe in this ""engagement"" so stop going to his place. 

2 weeks without that process and you can think about the next. no new therapists no new books actually do something. not think about doing it. or you will be 10 years engaged with this guy you are not in a relationship with."
sex,fqbyd99,t1_fqbvtat,1589246367.0,"I never said you did? I said I confused your post response with another post? that sounded similar but had more details in it. even owned up to the mistake. gave details of the post to clarify where I thought the update was from than offered a solution to avoid anyone else confusing you with other people?

&#x200B;

but yeah if that did not come clear I have edited the first reply to see if it makes it more understanding to you?

&#x200B;

I do wonder though why mistaking you for someone else makes me a monster? or have anything to do with trashing your feelings as well? I am sorry if it felt that way as it was not my intention just was hopeful that other women found the error of her ways and were able to repair her new wedding life"
AskReddit,fqbwku7,t1_fqbvedi,1589245344.0,"well, I was I think 3 months ago trying to figure out why so many ""MLM"" people would use namaste in every post as if it was a proof they are ""spiritual"" not because of their belief or even understanding yet I found most did not understand what namaste even meant. but I thought hey would go more generally and see how everyone else views such people.

dating,fq93lue,t3_ghjb7h,1589184352.0,"why does every group romanticise other groups as having it easier? I think the main thing is when we look at old-style dating we don't have actual evidence we have stories and those are generally horrible or good ones that make it seem like the relationships where easier but I would beg to differ. I think those relationships were fewer and less experienced so people were likely to keep the abusive father figure, accept the wife who hates them and keep the husband that cheated on her with every ""secretary"" because the idea of dating was not free'er but was less populace and the idea you were never going to have another chance was a lot more likely when you can't date/marry a widower or divorce.

&#x200B;

so you have more chances to meet and more chances to connect with people so now your job is not to find someone who says yes. but to find someone you actually get a long with because earning an income, owning a house or having the same faith is not enough your relationship needs to have a foundation stronger than your greatest friendship. so take the time date slowly and meet people. don't hold your last date against the next. do not paint your future with yesterdays garbage and just enjoy yourself dating and flirting is meant to be fun it ain't a job so stop stressing about it."
