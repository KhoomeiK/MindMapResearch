selfharm,fhjty63,t3_f3lorj,1581655511.0,"Love you too, and so proud of you!"
selfharm,fhjrtai,t1_fhjmoez,1581653788.0,"Thank you kind stranger, you have no idea (literally no idea) how much I needed to hear this."
selfharm,fhjjwgn,t3_f3ghf0,1581648029.0,I'm so sorry this happened :( addiction isn't something that's easily overcome and it's completely understandable why you relapsed. I'm not judging you at all and want you to know that I see you and I see that you're trying your best. I can DM you if you want company and/or to talk about it
selfharm,fhjiqo2,t3_f3fc8n,1581647212.0,"I do that a lot. I'll pick at my cuticles until they bleed and then I'll keep going. And I'll get high (just weed, nothing serious) and drink a shit ton until the room spins."
selfharm,fhjab3l,t1_fhja67q,1581641319.0,Thank you :)
selfharm,fhj9kl7,t3_f3fp1q,1581640846.0,"I understand, I hear you, I see you, and I'm sorry you're having a rough patch in your life. You are strong to have recovered in the first place and I know you can do it again. I believe in you and you are very much loved and accepted ❤️"
selfharm,fhcrwps,t1_fhcrp4h,1581469527.0,Thank you for your kind words and for offering to be there for me. I'd love to talk
selfharm,fhcrt3j,t3_f29qu2,1581469464.0,"I've done this exact same thing ever since I started. I even went so far as to only cut on the left side of my body only, I guess to represent that only half of me is fucked up. I'm an artist, I thought I was being ""deep"" lol, but I really like it now"
selfharm,fhawhof,t3_f2392i,1581428961.0,I wish I knew why its addicting. I've been clean for years and I still dream about doing it.
depression,fh54c0n,t3_f1djgl,1581284861.0,"I feel the EXACT same way when I slip back into my depression or feel like I've screwed up. I kind of enjoy being miserable and find it much easier to sink into it rather than pull myself out, and most of the time I lose my motivation to pull myself out. It's definitely not a healthy habit, and I'm a lot better than I used to be. Therapy had a lot to do with my recovery and I loved and hated going at the same time.

Point is, I feel ya and I understand what you're feeling."
