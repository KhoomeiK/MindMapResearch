China is a country with 1.4 billion (that‚Äôs about 1.8 times the population of the entire Europe) and with:

A extremely weak middle class;
More than 75% its people with NO high school diploma;
90%+ with NO college diploma;
Extremely huge income gap.

Any fool running a country with demographics this challenging and prone to chaos would somehow opt for coercion and control in exchange for stability.

In fact, if you know a little bit about China‚Äôs history you‚Äôd easily see that the country has undergone a massive amount of chaos, poverty, and humiliation during the last two centuries. And what they now desperately needs is stability, even at the cost of freedom and human rights. 

So, should we condemn the Chinese government for lying to its citizens and suppressing individual freedom? Hell fucking yeah.  But NOBODY running a country like this would do better a job than CCP. In fact, the mere fact that the virus originated in China (assuming that really is the case but no one will ever know for sure) and most of China is now back to work after just 4 months proves that whoever runs this country deserves a fucking medal.  

Yeah, keep the downvotes coming, Reddit. I never had high hopes for you anyway."

composer,fhi0248,t3_f2uoyt,1581615146.0,"Depends on why you ‚Äúgot stuck‚Äù:

If you get stuck because you don‚Äôt know what to write next (most probably cause), you should probably up your form game. Best way I know of doing this is just to analyze the works of the greats - Mozart, Schumann, Brahms, etc. 

If you‚Äôre stuck because you don‚Äôt like what you wrote but don‚Äôt want to rewrite either, then it‚Äôll of course be best to move on. 

Composers get stuck all the time, especially if they‚Äôre looking to break rules.  You‚Äôll least likely get stuck if you‚Äôre writing a piece that is subject to some kind of well-established form, but I‚Äôm sure good composers are always breaking the rules. So yeah, we get stuck A LOT.

I definitely agree for a waltz-like piece like this it would be intuitive to write in 3/4 or 3/8. The main reason why I wrote this way is because I would like to pay respect to 2nd movement of Ravel‚Äôs piano concerto (a piece of music that changed my life to say the least) and his quirky way of notating the accompaniment.  (He notated the piece in 3/4 but the left-hand accompaniment feels as though it is in 6/8.
