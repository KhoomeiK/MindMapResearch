bipolar,flzwzpy,t1_flzun7y,1585636325.0,">If I understand correctly, you are feeling disconnected from your body?

I was thinking more along the lines of disconnected from a higher source. In depression I feel that: a complete lack of anything spiritual. In mania there's so much of it that our spirit beyond the physical leaks into the experience we live out as everyday humans. Perhaps they/we or it--I don't know--don't belong on this plane yet since it's out of line with consensus reality.

I suspect the reason for that may have something to do with the lack of enlightenment. We aren't exactly ready to live in Eden/Nirvana--whatever--as our spiritual selves because we haven't learned the lessons of this experience.

I feel like it's something deeper than the subconscious coming out--the soul that's behind even that.

Well I'm at the computer and I can feel what it's like to be this, a human. My feet are on the floor. I can feel that from the inside with my 'inner body' and, on the outside, I can feel the surface of the wooden floor.

I do not believe this is the issue. I start off with, 'What if I start brushing teeth?' I try to get inside my body and move it. That's where I get stuck. I can get as far as moving something, anything like contracting my torso or glute, leaning forward. But the more I go with it, the more... I don't know? I just can't. I get this really negative energy gluing me to my position. I talked to dad about it when I was stuck in the hallway, faced with the awful decision of just standing there or brushing my teeth. I'll say I was definitely depressed then but this problem seems to have stuck with me. 

'Take a step,' I managed to push through the inability when I heard him say that and was already trying. If you're just, just about to jump and someone says it authoritatively or with care, it can happen. Didn't stop the shaking. I had to readjust myself, get comfortable with where I was standing until the next action. Overall I just didn't want to be there facing such a challenge. You can read how it ended in the OP.

I don't really mind having this problem because I don't really want to brush my teeth anyway.

>That's where your ideal health lies, (nomadism), not in a misunderstood simplification of centuries of people across two continents.

I've kind of fallen out of the idea of reverting to the way we once were with nature altogether since I wrote all this. I mean I suffer bipolar due to antibiotics wiping out the necessary bacteria for my brain to be happy. I also have autistic symptoms (ASD). I realize that even though I started off with all these disadvantages I can overcome them. Only fecal matter transplantation really made that possible though, and the help of a phenomenal lady on the internet.

I'm starting an exciting journey. I do agree with Arthur Haines though. I think we have a lot to learn about living in harmony with nature and ourselves, and that we have a lot to learn from pre-industrial cultures. I also believe what he says about our health. I might have to pay the 60-plus AU dollars one day and just buy his book. Love to see what I can learn."

Succinctly, I believe we've gone too far in the other direction with mania.

> I just am enjoying life 

Trust me I know what that feels like. It happens sometimes when I read super good news. I got an email from someone trying to help me with FMT and she's super on to it. It's how I felt when I rediscovered my favorite childhood music but when I say I'm feeling that bipolar high, it's not the same. It's something instantly distinguishable to me. There's a sense beyond emotion, touch sight or smell that happens. My psyche kind of spreads outside my body and I become way more in touch with what's around me with zero effort. I can move up the stairs in seconds without feeling any weight or strain. It's that feeling that stays with me all the way up until I end up in hospital after the automatic responses have become actions out of line with consensus reality (psychosis). That sense comes to me in all manner of intensities, but it's still the same sense. When it first comes on it's 'this is how I'm truly meant to feel', then it's like 'The way they treat this illness is detrimental to my health and everyone experiencing it. I think shamans were really onto something.' When I'm just enjoying something it's totally not that. I can't even call it hypomania if it hasn't already lasted a few days? What if the feeling's subtle but definitely there? What am I supposed to call it before it lasts the few days? 'Hey guys, I think I'm having hypomania', 'Uh well, no you're not because the textbook says it has to be a few days' People in the comments say this guy's on the manic swing of bipolar, but if all they're going on is the unfortunately 'official' DSMV criteria then they can't call it that because it's uncertain whether what they're experiencing leads to psychosis--because it hasn't. You couldn't even call it anything without a certain numbers of days which is particularly frustrating to someone who knows what they're experiencing.

Mania's not just feeling really really happy. It's a human experience that's on a whole nother axis than happy/sad, feeling good/bad. That's my experience. For a culture that prides itself on everything being correct and scientifically proven, I find it odd that they so willingly overlook the experiences of patients such as me. I only get glimpses into mania, and it's very spiritually, socially, worldly and morally focused. I've had two manic episodes (by your criteria) but I've had a whole lot more shit in between. If someone's autistic, they're on the autism spectrum. Why can't it be similar with mania? 

Would you prefer it if people stuck to say I'm feeling manic, rather than stating outright that they are?

> Mania has a meaning, and it’s not “feeling better or more energetic than I usually feel.” It’s, in a nut shell, “energy so extreme that it leads to psychosis or significant impairment to your ability to function, manifesting as racing thoughts, pressured speech, impulsivity, hypersexuality, grandiose thoughts, euphoria, or dysphoria.”

>you're ignoring the complexity of their history and blaming the source of their plights on industrialization instead of the atrocities actually inflicted upon them.

Which were inflicted by 'civilized' people--pillaging, rape, murder and slavery. I'm saying they were better off before all that happened. I'm unsure of what you're saying other than it was widespread and complex.

I mean that. I don't get what you're saying. I was idolizing a pure, undisturbed group of people who were married to nature (as opposed to divorced). From what we've seen, they were healthy in the way they did things by default, compared to what we've made ourselves become and, in the process of our own advancement, perhaps towards ultimate destruction, them as well. I'm saying they've been integrated into a very sick way of life, and I'm aware that the way in which that happened was appalling.

I'm aware they face cultural and social difficulties due to those events to this day. I feel like the traumas passed on even though the events were over a hundred years ago, though they probably continued long after that.

You're saying atrocities were inflicted on them, and that these atrocities were slightly different across all the parts of America. There are many aspects to how this affected them, but I believe 'health' is broad enough to encompass everything you're saying as well.

Our views aren't mutually exclusive.

I implied civilization inflicted those atrocities upon them. That's why I said attitudes, attitudes still present even in modern civilization. There are still camps where they steal children from tribes and 'civilize' them, aka stripping them of their family, identity, instilling in them that everything they knew was wrong and abusing and raping them. I've only seen industrialization do this.

If you wanna downvote what I'm saying, I'd appreciate it if you could say why in just a few sentences. All downvotes do is send a message that what someone said isn't respected. It's not conducive to actual discussion."

Why should that taint their legacy? Just goes to show what the attitudes and environmental shortcomings of modern industrialization can do to the health of an entire race."

You normally feel *strongly euphoric* and like turning the lights on is a sign of 'enlightenment' for no reason other than just waking up like that? He's had psychosis before. Could be from the weed though.

>I wanna believe ""normal"" people think same way

Coming from someone whose first hopes were along these lines during his first textbook mania, this is a highly relatable thought/feeling."
