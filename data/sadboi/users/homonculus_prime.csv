I understand that they don't actually have a trillion dollars. They have, however, managed to obtain somewhere near that amount of wealth by grossly underpaying and overworking their employees.

Continue treating them like trash and you'll see more and more of what we saw in the video. It really is that simple.

&#x200B;

This was a game that we made the time to sit down and play together  after we put our kiddos to bed at night. We played it at least once  every date night we had, sometimes twice. We loved every minute of it,  and we actually did very well at it together. We ended up finishing with  the Legendary achievement and we didn't even know we were playing for  points. We ended up losing four games, three of which were back to back  losses (things really got out of hand in September). Now that we've  finished it, we are looking for our next adventure to embark on  together. We are about to play Auztralia for the first time, but I  almost feel like another co-op and/or legacy type game might be in our  very near future. Any suggestions for a 2 player (preferably co-op) game  for a couple who adored playing Pandemic Legacy Season 1? I have some  Amazon credit I can spend on it, so price isn't a huge issue.

We own Pandemic Legacy Season 2, but we have set it aside for playing with another group. I feel like we should go ahead and play it together, since I don't think this group will be able to get together often enough for us to enjoy it properly, but I haven't been able to convince my wife of that yet. :)"

My feelings are that we should just go ahead and play it, as I don't think we'll be able to get together consistently enough, but I haven't yet convinced my wife."

It is innocent until proven guilty. If the only evidence the police have is a video of you committing a crime, then I feel like they have a right to detain you until they are able to obtain evidence of your innocence. I do feel like there should be no further consequences, except perhaps the court ordering him to post a video issuing an adequate apology for his childish, disgusting behavior.

Edit: I'm pretty far from being an authoritarian, but this douchbaggery cannot be further encouraged."

It just costs more to educate a student who has to worry about from where they will get their next meal than it does a student who goes home to a nice cozy home in Mountain Brook and have similar outcomes.

Edit: Also, a huge portion of that extra money comes from the Federal Government, not from the state."
