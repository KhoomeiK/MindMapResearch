EternalCardGame,fqa24qj,t1_fqa0u16,1589211450.0,"I feel like I can play any deck I want and haven't sunk a lot of time into it. You also get a free Expedition (their draft format) and champion (their legendary) wildcard each week just from the xp you get if you completed all your daily quests (or very very close to the amount), you can even save up the daily quests (up to 3) and knock them out in vs AI if you don't have much time to play. 

Just with the weekly rewards I imagine it staying that way."
EternalCardGame,fq9yvrm,t3_ghmkxf,1589209724.0,"I'm a bit tired of saving up all my gold for campaign after campaign and as I started to play less over time (my play time dropped a lot when draft rewards dropped) it became more and more annoying to keep up with. 

The biggest selling point of this game was how F2P friendly it was and Runeterra blows it out of the water in that regard. And Shadowverse does it a bit better too, which I only play very sporadically, I am still able to make a Rotation deck in my favorite class with each set. Eternal feels like I have to work to keep up now and it just doesn't feel like it's worth it anymore.  

I'll still come back to Eternal now and again but I can't see it becoming the main card game I play anytime soon."

I'm a big fan of the entire Sawyer family from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The family dynamic is creepy, very ghoulish, and a bit funny. I particularly like when they are cheering on grandpa, Tobe Hooper must have liked it too because he put the scene in the 2nd movie too. If I had to pick just one of them it'd be Drayton. 

I've never seen the remakes of them but was always curious how the family was handled especially because I felt like the advertising was all on Leatherface, which made the movies not look very interesting to me."
