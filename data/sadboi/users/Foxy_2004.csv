SuicideWatch,fqghgy1,t3_gins3m,1589346386.0,I understand your point and I just want to say that you should try talking to people who understand the kind of suffering and pain you go through. And some people do care. You just gotta try and find them.

KindVoice,fph9red,t3_gdcxhp,1588617453.0,"You seem like a very nice person judging by how you help your siblings and friends even when you don't barely have time for it. The reason for your stress is obvious. You care too much about what others think of you and yet this is what drives you forward. If the people did not think of you as the smart person you are then you probably would not be at this level. I think that their opinions of you is what pushes you forward and makes you want to work harder. I am not telling you to just stop caring, you just have to find that balance and do what you want.

You mentioned somewhere that you thought your parents don't look at you as the normal faulty person you are. You said that they kept praising you as if you were perfect. I guess this is because they are just proud of you and want you to continue being the person you are. They obviously do not think that you are perfect. I think they just love you and they think that mentioning your faults might discourage you so they try their best.
I really hope this helps"

If you haven't read oathbringer then do not read this

\[OB\]>!Remember when Szeth becomes Dalinar's bodyguard and decides to help them at the end? I didn't like how no one except Jasnah said something. I understand that they were busy trying to stop Odium when Szeth came but none of the characters said anything afterwards which is weird. He killed Navani's husband so I don't understand how the people closest to Gavilar barely objected. Gavilar and Dalinar were brothers and so they obviously loved each other. How can Dalinar trust his brother's assassin? It just doesnt make sense to me...!<"
Stormlight_Archive,fowl9kw,t3_g9zbum,1588121998.0,Don't worry about oathbringer. Most people love it but there is just some slight flaw that probably wont stop you from enjoying it. The book is excellent and Dalinar's backstory is executed very well.

Sanderson says that Szeth would spend his time at ROW in prison. Dalinar was a murderous tyrant in the past and he is a changed man which is why he has not been punished (and also bcs no one couldve punished dalinar even if they wanted to). Kaladin  was on the battlefield defending Amaram because he believed that Amaram was perfect.

Adolin would probably be punished only if the people of roshar started to know who murdered Sadeas. I know that Adolin told Dalinar in the latest book but I dont think Dalinar would do anything to him unless word gets out because adolin is his son and he loves him.

My english is not very good. I am sorry."
