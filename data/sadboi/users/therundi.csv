Go to the pool early while it's quiet and find a quiet space down the shallow end. Practice putting your face in the water while holding your nose. Do it repeatedly until you can do so calmly. Move up to putting your face in while holding your nose, then taking your hand away while your face is still in the water. Blow air out through your nose while you are taking your hand away. Try it several times and after a while you'll get a feel for how much pressure you need to blow out so you're no longer blowing bubbles but just preventing the water from coming in. After a while you'll be able to dunk your face without needing to hold your nose at all, just blowing air out, you'll probably need to blow out more while your face is moving down into the water, then you can reduce how much you blow once you're in. Once you've done that enough times to be able to do it and still feel relaxed you're ready to try swimming. Go for smth like breaststroke so you can go slow and easy without having to gasp for air. Stay within a depth you can handle until you're confident."

Another thing you can try that I've found helpful is to avoid outlining anything, but focusing entirely on the tones/shading, like a real painterly approach, try to disassociate a bit from it being a face and just really focus on the tones and shapes. It's common with faces in particular that we make features like the eyes and lips bigger than they should be, so it's good to try to ignore your preconceptions about what a face should look like and just really observe.
