Drugs,ewi6o3v,t1_ewi6l3m,1565440497.0,Because you've thought about your answers for too long and it just builds up tension so you refrain speaking

Drugs,ewi6gn0,t1_ewi5tsj,1565440274.0,"Before I smoked it a couple of friends and I were just hanging out, actually enjoying ourselves just talking about shit, but when I smoked my second cone I started to regret my decision. My first hit wasnt much weed at all, the second one had slightly more in it. I remember hearing my friend talking to her boyfriend and she said, ""why did you get him high?"" So now my anxiety and paranoia is telling me that I ruined everything."
Drugs,ewi5tdw,t1_ewi2ol4,1565439557.0,If your in that mode and a friend is trying to talk to you and your just not saying anything. Do you feel like they're getting irritated because they're trying to communicate? Your thinking about your answers in your head but can't physically express your self.

Advice,ern5e4u,t3_c2wn7r,1561045005.0,"You won't be able to get rid of the crush feeling that you have started within your own head, and that will continue to grow even stronger the more time you spend around her, but you'll be alright. Just don't do anything stupid. Just don't say anything that could stress the relationship between the three of you. As you spend more time with the two of them you start to become jealous. Of the relationship they have. Because you wish that she was with you instead. It starts to become a bit painful when your feelings for her develop further. It then starts to become awkward.

I would suggest to try and think of her as a sister as best you can. Respect the bro code and you'll be fine."
