I was anorexic for about two years, but thought that I couldn't be because I wasn't ""small enough,"" but looking back at photos now, I can 100% see what everyone else saw and can't believe I even had the capability to shrink back down to that size. I really hope you find help! It's a terrible, terrible captor over your life. I've been going through recovery for a few years, but have only recently started to gain some freedom back. Sending you good vibes and all the strength."
