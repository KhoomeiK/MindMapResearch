Mind telling me what exactly these regimes are? bc if u tell me cuba I’d like to ask you how you think black cubans were treated before the revolution? or what the literacy rate or life expectancy was before the revolution compared to now.
How much have you heard Pete criticize the US being allies with Saudi Arabia, one of the most homophobic countries in the world and who not to mention is committing genocide in Yemen with US taxpayer bought weapons."
Pete_Buttigieg,fj8t6d7,t1_fj8sjz3,1583121566.0,"this comment in itself proves that your ideology is not closer to Sanders. And if it were, it just proves your ideology is easily malleable. 

Kamala was slandered because of her involvement in incarcerating and throwing the book at people particularly those who’ve used marijuana while she herself has laughed about using it.

edit: i didnt mean to make this comment as judgemental as it came out but if your ideology is closer to sanders i would definitely plead you to consider hopping on his movement. you’ll be welcomed with open arms."

guitarpedals,fgk9boq,t1_fgk7m83,1580860301.0,it doesnt seem like cuz i just isolated muff to be the only one recieving power and there was sound but no effect but the volume dial worked
guitarpedals,fgk96si,t1_fgk7zu1,1580860215.0,It does not appear to be a power issue. i isolated the muff to be the only plugged in pedal and it produced sound but no effect except for the volume dial working.
guitarpedals,fgk8x04,t1_fgk84sd,1580860039.0,I just tried using a different power supply on the sdrum and had the muff back at the beginning. as what happened last time that it wasnt working there was no overdrive effect but the volume dial on it still worked

guitarpedals,fgk4xv2,t3_eyyyuu,1580857578.0,"so here is my board. i just recently got an EH nano muff overdrive and i wasnt getting any sound at first when it was in the beginning of the signal chain, but then i simply replugged things and then i was getting sound.

Then the issue was that the pedal wasnt producing an effect so i switched it with the holy grail to second. Once i did this it produced an effect but only when the holy grail was on. 

any ideas on what’s happening?

edit: spelling"

guitarpedals,ff81w11,t1_ff81h31,1579663818.0,"Yeah pretty much everytime I use it (like every day) i end up making a new beat (i cant fit my real drums in my dorm) I like the options it gives you for cymbals but there could be more kick/snare options imo. 

i’ve been manually building the beats tho because i have no idea how to use the autogenerative drumming feature. I’ll have to look into it later.

edit: oh and with regards to your timing issue i use an RC-3 loop station along with it and i find its rlly helpful to make a loop before inputting a beat"
