This man never cared about you, and never will. You're just another notch in the bedpost and now he's on to fresher things. The only reason he keeps contacting you is to keep you dangling. Wake up and realize that you're not even the side chick anymore; you're the side chick to the actual side chick. He knows that you have feelings for him and he reaches out when absolutely no one else is available. Don't you realize how pathetic that sounds and makes you? Do you not have any self-esteem? If you don't, then you need to work on that, possibly with therapy.

How you stop cheating with him is by using your self-control. Block him on everything. Phone (calls and text), social media, email... EVERYTHING. Don't unblock him no matter how much you want to. Hours turn into days, days to weeks, weeks to months, and months to years.

I do understand why your daughter is upset and lashing out though. I'm sure that she still loves her aunt but is having a hard time processing what her aunt's profession is. I think she lashed out with those words because she's hurt. You need to understand that your daughter is most likely being judged and labeled at school now even though she has nothing to do with (and didn't even know) her aunt's choices.

Something that was supposed to be temporary turned into forever about 2 years later when the mom decided that she was just done and wanted to move on with her life. She said that she was young and didn't really have time for kids anyhow. My husband and I didn't want them back in DHS custody, so we adopted them. From the start our families treated these children just like our biological children, like they were ours. They were never left out of family photos or get-togethers. Why? Because they were our family members, even when it was just a temporary situation.
