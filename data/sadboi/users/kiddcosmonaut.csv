Her excuse was that he smelled bad (?) and she just didn't feel like taking care of him anymore. I definitely feel your pain.

BPD,fqd2w3z,t1_fqcv64e,1589277850.0,"I ordered a sampler from feilds of hemp with like a g of their 8 most popular strains. Smoking just cbd when id normally smoke weed gives me the relaxed feeling almost like smoking cigarettes, though just ""going through the motions"" same time same place as I would weed may have something to do with it. Like tricking myself, I guess. I've also mixed half cbd half weed, which is the relaxed cigarette feeling amplified, it's not like a full on high so if someone's expecting that, they'll be disappointed. As a regular smoker, I consider it like a 1 or 2/10 ""high"" with just cbd and like a 3 or 4/10 with the mix. Only downside for me is the taste. It looks and smells exactly like dank weed, but every strain I've tried tasted like shitty  ditch weed and it was really hard for me to get over it at first. I smoke weed from a bong normally, but can't with cbd, gotta smoke a j so I don't get so much dirt flavor. Even a mixed cbd/weed bowl, it just ruins the taste of the weed for sure. It did work to lower my tolerance, though, and I've recommended it to others,  so thank you again. Also made 4/20 fun for my friends who couldn't smoke (illegal state) or chose not to."

I use it to lower my weed tolerance by either smoking a mix of weed and CBD or just CBD in a blunt or joint. Anytime I feel and urge to smoke, I do that instead and so far it has worked. Doubt it will get you high per say, but for me it's more about the action of smoking when I normally would that helps me for the most part. Like tricking myself into thinking I've smoked at the routine time by going through the motions. Also, if you don't already, I recommend some sort of vigorous daily physical activity where you sweat a lot and also make sure you hydrate a lot. This always helps lower my tolerance. Best of luck."
