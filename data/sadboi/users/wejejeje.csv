Then what would be that level of talent that makes you a musician? 


I feel as though you using the term musician as if it's a prestigious title even though it isn't. And to repeat my point before, a musician is anyone that plays a musical instrument or has musical talent. You do not have to be a instrumentalist to be a musician. That means your everyday rapper is a musician."

Wikipedia definition: ""A musician is a person who plays a musical instrument or is musically talented. Anyone who composes, conducts, or performs music is referred to as a musician. A musician who plays a musical instrument is also known as an instrumentalist.""

So yes, they could be listed as a musician. But I'm also sure that both xxxtentacion and Billie Eillish can play the guitar and piano and done so on some of their songs"
