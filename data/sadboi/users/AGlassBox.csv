I'm more talking about the sudden bursts of immediate rage that I can't hold back at first. Completely blind sighted by them, but I usually back off pretty quick. Also the hypothetical shouting matches I get into in my head. Pretty intrusive, but that's what the meditation helps with. 

Talking with the person after was part of my frustration. Where they say ""oh it's ok, it was just your bipolar"". I feel like those are still my feelings and I want to be respected more than anything. Even if I'm hypomanic or whatever it doesn't mean I always become completely irrational. Sometimes it just feels like people think I'm automatically spouting crazy nonsense if I get even a little upset or defensive. I just want to have my feelings be valid instead of a symptom sometimes. I didn't mean to accuse either. Your comment was well intended."

Either way I was ranting, not really asking for a solution, or to have the person I was venting about validated in the opinion I was upset with. I appreciate your good intentions though."
DreamInterpretation,ffqqq2j,t3_euoxri,1580141434.0,"The way I look at dreams is based off of the Psychologist Carl Jung. I, myself, am not a doctor. All of this is an opinion.

Usually ""sexual union"" in a dream hints at unifying with a different part of yourself. One way to look at dreams is that they are plays your brain puts on where you play every character. A different part of you is a stand in for everything. So if you look at the dude devil that forced himself on you- it can be held alongside the symbol of struggling upstream. It stopping to think of a better way to ""get you"" could be dreaming up something more shocking to ""get"" your attention. 

The devil could represent your dark side, what Jung called ""The Shadow"". The shadow is all the things about yourself that you repress. These could be ""morally evil"" things but they can also be harmless things you put the lid on. Like talking to a parent, and they suddenly say ""you talk too much"" so you try not to talk as much. Even if they were innocent themselves. You still out that thing away. The dream could be urging you to reunite yourself with things that are ""you"" but you don't let them see the light of day, hence the name Shadow. 

A lame way I think of it is that scene in highschool musical, where the people all sing about stuff that they kept hidden but loved to do. In some cases there were bullies who picked on people who did those very same things they loved. We teach ourselves to suppress these things so we'll we get annoyed with others and try to push it away from them as well. A good way to try and ""pin down"" your shadow could be to pay attention to things that make you angry. What about it makes you angry? I was angry for a long time at people who were over confident. That's because I wished I was more confident myself. 

A little thing I did was I let myself go to metal concerts. I grew up pretty religious, but also I was in some mental bad water. Metal was a great outlet for me but I was always taught it was evil. Listening to the part of myself that told me that the thing I liked about metal helped me through a lot of hard stuff, and that that couldn't really be that bad. It's a silly thing but it has helped me feel more me, if that makes sense. 

The struggling up the river is the resisting. I obviously don't have much to go on regarding you and what you are going through. If you managed to read this far into my wall of text, then just remember that you are the final authority on your own dream. If it doesn't sound right then it probably isn't. Thinking about it more might bring up some stuff. I don't think dreams are useless. Again, that's just my own belief. There may be some heavy stuff you are dealing with and I hope I haven't stirred up anything negative. Just trying to help."

DreamInterpretation,fees1mn,t1_feemnw4,1579039986.0,"It could have a connection. If you feel that fixing things with the friend it would sort of fit the symbol of the snake. Basically biting the bullet so that you and your friend are square. But at the end of the day it's your dream, if that doesn't sound right then it probably isn't. If you do feel like talking to them would help, then why not give it a shot?

I'm not a psychologist or anything. Many people get stuck one a symbol meaning only one thing. But try googling different ways to interpret snakes or being malnourished, or being trapped in a box. But what you brought up sounds like a good conclusion to reach because talking it out with the friend would bring closure to the thing. Either you guys officially go separate ways or you are friends again. The only way to know is to try."
DreamInterpretation,feelggy,t3_eord7h,1579036149.0,"Snakes in dreams  usually have something to do with making a change. If we use old stories to help us understand symbolism, the dragon was a kind of snake that needed to be slayed to move on to a better situation. Satan in the garden of Eden offered forbidden knowledge for the chance to progress. The idea is that you sacrifice something for progress. Snakes can either be slain or ignored. If the snake was malnourished and kept in a box it's possible that something in your subconscious has been putting something off that it wants to get done. I know that I put off simple things because of anxiety or other reasons, but taking care of these ""snakes"" usually leads to a better and Fuller life."

exmormon,f78xo8v,t3_duty8a,1573499799.0,"Ive got Bipolar type 1. When I was in the throes of mania I felt that I could see through the veil to God. Those moments were always a staple in my faith. Hugely spiritual, and the ""spiritual high"" I heard about was a real thing. 

When I was depressed I couldn't see or feel God anywhere. If I did everything right I'd feel as if God was punishing me. Cue the ""where is that hiding place"" thing Joe wrote about in the jail. 

During mania I was hyper sexual, lots of porn and masturbation. Pray it away, do whatever it takes to get rid of it. I'd do the cold shower thing, pray, take long jogs, pray, even tell my parents I'm struggling, then pray some more. None of it worked. But sometimes that mania made me feel like I still had the spirit with me. 

I began to let myself notice that my obedience to God had nothing to do with how I felt toward him. I then let myself actually feel good outside of church situations. To not limit ""the spirit"" to churchy things. I noticed that guilt was gone and that everything the church teaches about the exclusivity of the spirit was bogus.

Then the bishop, who is a surgeon treated me like trash when I opened up about my doubts and feelings. Started saying everyone who didn't come to church ""probably had bipolar or something""."
