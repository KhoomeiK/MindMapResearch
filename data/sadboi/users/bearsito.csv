Mould-proof paint etc. will only last for a while in that environment, because it doesn't kill mould in the air, it only creates a barrier that it eventually eats through. The last straw was when it got into my suits/clothing. I declared war on mould! I tried all kinds of stuff. Luckily I know a biologist who specializes in fungus, and got some advice from him. Plain old vinegar is your best friend against mould. Here's what worked, and it never came back again:


* Wash walls/furniture and other hard surfaces with bleach. Bleach only kills a small percentage of spore types, but it will take away the discoloration. 

* Generously spray/wipe the surfaces with white vinegar. This will kill the other 97% (?) of spore types. Just leave it, the smell will go away after a while.

* Soak clothing with white vinegar. I sprayed/wiped it onto my suits and let it sit overnight. But anything that can handle thorough soaking, go for it.

* Rinse and wash clothes (or dry clean)

* A dehumidifier makes a big difference, but even without it I've never had mold grow back in a spot I've soaked with vinegar and left it."
