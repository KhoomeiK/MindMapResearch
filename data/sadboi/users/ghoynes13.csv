Young poodles have an incredible amount of energy. My current poodle (2 years old) needs a 60 minute intense session of running off leash (usually fetching a ball) and another 30 minute relaxed play sesh (hide and seek around the house).
She spends the rest of the day sleeping in various spots of the house in various positions.
If we don't exercise her enough (like when I'm really ill), she will sit opposite me, stare me down for like ages, paw me to try and coax me into moving and then sulk if she knows it's too late to go out.

After being in heat however it can take my dog a few weeks after the bleeding stops before she feels more like herself. I wouldn't worry too much, it sounds like you're doing everything right. She'll certainly let you know if she's ready to exercise more."

He was extremely old school but he diagnosed me and I'm grateful for that.

Don't feel too bad about being accused of researching everything online. I HAD to do all the research online, learnt how to track my moods from Reddit with Daylio, and that was how I got diagnosed. Although, like you I am a researcher (masters), so I like to think it's okay for me to do so. My psych never gave me a specific diagnosis, just Bipolar Affective Disorder. The specifics don't matter too much though so long as you find the right meds to work for you.

The falling in love thing is a definite bipolar symptom. I can't tell you how many times I've 'fallen in love' with people, guys and girls (I'm not even gay), only to awake from it a few weeks later and branding it as another silly phase. Literally hundreds of times, ever since I can remember and it ruined so many of my genuinely good relationships.

Hope the meds are working for you. I was prescribed lamotrigine to stop me going down and olanzapine to stop me going up. Olanzapine made me too groggy so managed to convince GP to switch to seroquel and that was much better.

Two weeks later I increased to 50mg and the same thing happened, this time I was much more aware and took a seroquel more often during my hypomanic phase because no way was I going to hit manic again. Seroquel also takes the edge off my social anxiety, blushing etc and I sleep so good.

I like taking seroquel on an 'as needed' basis because I like having the energy to do things and being more social when I'm just slightly hypomanic. I've learnt to be more aware of when it starts to rise too high and nip it in the bud when necessary.

I should really be saying ""I've been alternating between periods of shutting myself away from the world, crying, feeling sorry for myself to being super confident, sociable, energetic to having my brain hijacked by a really angry, violent monkey.""

Anyway I'm starting to write out a plan, colour coded, kind of like daylio but marking how many episodes I've had over the week (or month depending on how often you cycle), and the symptoms I've experienced. Nothing too OTT, just basic and easy to understand so I can show them that instead of fumbling with words for the entire appointment and walking away mad.

It took me 4 excruciatingly long months to get diagnosed because I couldn't describe my symptoms. If I had tracked my moods and written out my symptoms in the beginning, I might have been diagnosed in under a month...

So to sum up a comment that was meant to be half this size... Write down your symptoms, give it to your doc or psych and explain that you have trouble describing everything, it's easier to write it down than to have to remember and emphasise that these issues are affecting your life and wellbeing.

bipolar,fhbketk,t1_fhbb7xc,1581444080.0,I would much rather be able to prescribe myself meds. I'm a masters research student in biochemistry so I'm pretty sure I'd be able to figure out the right combo (with most of my research being done in this reddit sub lol).
bipolar,fhbk7wu,t1_fhbg52k,1581443969.0,"Thank you so much for reading. I have to say, if it wasn't for this sub I would have given up in getting a diagnosis a long time ago! 

You're right, I should probably start looking for doctor that's more on the ball and up to date on mental health issues. Maybe my uni doctor is so used to seeing stressed out students and automatically dispensing generic antidepressants."
bipolar,fhbisl2,t1_fhbhetu,1581443142.0,"I should have clarified that my current doctor will be monitoring my titration of lamotrigine until it's up to the recommended dose (think he said 50mg?). But in terms of changing dosage or meds, I would need to be re-referred back to a psychiatrist which would probably be another 3-4weeks wait time.
I do think I'll go private for therapy, I definitely think whatever form I have can't be treated with medication alone."
bipolar,fhbhg9x,t1_fhbgdql,1581442371.0,"I did think I would need to see someone regularly while stabilizing. Your plan sounds like exactly what I need!

bipolar,fhb9ddl,t1_fhb7yem,1581437570.0,"Thanks for reading and replying. 

That's a good point, maybe I'm being a little impatient. I'm so happy I've been given meds to stabilize the highs and lows, I should probably wait till I've adjusted to them and then ask again for an increase in my mirtazapine dose. 

Thank you for your insight!"
bipolar,fhahzu6,t1_fh8u4cv,1581411513.0,"So glad I'm not the only one. If I feel like I'm getting 'high' (hypomanic), I make myself sleep and 9 times outta 10, it brings me back down. 

Sometimes I don't want it to end though and I deliberately don't sleep. But that happens 1 time outta 10 ;)"
bipolar2,fh2ddxw,t3_f15uap,1581247435.0,"I hate hate hate feeling that way. How long are your depressive episodes? I rapid cycle so I can go through 2-3 'down days' a week where I get intrusive thoughts, violent urges, crying fits and feeling utterly helpless. 

Journaling helps me. I write down exactly how I feel and when I start to panic, worrying that I'll have to suffer through this forever, I tell myself it will pass. Simple yet effective. I will write it down, I will say it out loud to myself. Sometimes if it's really bad, I'll rock back and forth, eyes closed repeating it over and over until I've calmed down a little. And it WILL pass, it may feel like forever, and it's agonizing torture but it will pass. 

If you can, force yourself to have a cold shower or go outside into nature. Tell yourself it's only for 5 minutes and if you can stay out longer, even better! It helps me lessen the bad feelings, they're there but it's just a little more tolerable.

Hang in there, I promise you'll get through this â¤"
ibs,fh09laj,t1_fh03md4,1581201580.0,"I understand completely how you feel. The one thing I wish I had the courage to do back then in school was to sit down with my principal and say ""Look I have IBS, I'm not comfortable in quiet rooms, sometimes I need to leave and I don't want to make a scene. Can we make adjustments?"". My principal actually did pull me aside after my absences started piling up but I was too embarrassed to say anything, I just ended up crying. If I said something he might have accommodated it, he was a lovely guy really.

Wait till you get to university though, it's SO much easier. I went straight to the uni doctor and she put me on meds and classed my IBS and anxiety as a long standing medical disability. Which meant I could leave lectures without being questioned, if my attendance was lacking I would be offered extra help, I got extensions on assigments, I got therapy (CBT which didn't help me but it was still nice to try it), and BEST OF ALL: I got put in my own little room for any exams. It was amazing!! People would ask why I wasn't in for the exam and I would explain that I took it separately because I have a disability and it's true! 
So at least you have that to look forward to :) 
(I'm in the UK btw).

Thank you also for your kind words, it's really great to talk to a kind understanding group. I never really had this oppurtunity 10 years ago!"
ibs,fgzrgne,t1_ex01dru,1581196885.0,">I miss my friends, the old me, the old happy version of myself who could sit in cinemas and have sleepovers, but now I just live in pity and dread and guilt and it drives me insane, scared that the noises are going to draw attention to myself. I donât even think I will be able to take my final exams because of my stomach, that makes me feel so depressed and angry- like why does this have to happen to me? Iâm good academically but now my whole life and future is ruined thanks to my bad anxiety and consistent stomach noises.

This was literally me 10 years ago and what you wrote hit me hard. I developed severe PTSD from being forced to go into school despite my claims about how incredibly anxious and panicked it would make me.

The first time my stomach made those horrendous loud gurgling, trombone-esque noises I think part of me died that day. I stopped being social, I DREADED big quiet rooms, in fact I literally developed a fear of meetings, lectures or formal family dinners, anything in a room where you were expected to sit quietly for hours on end with no escape, no food or music. 

I've spent probably thousands on every imaginable cure, pill, DIY remedy the internet had to offer in the past 10 years and I'll offer up the only things that seemed to help:

â¢ Anti-depressants: I've always been an anxious being and anyone in my family who also suffers with IBS has some form of anxiety. I don't know if they lessened the anxiety which was causing my IBS which was causing the noises, OR it stopped me caring as much which then lessened my fear of the noises happening. Either way, they are a godsend, look into them especially if you suffer from panic attacks, PTSD or general anxiety.

â¢ Limit Dairy and Caffeine: No Dairy or caffeine before an event where you know you're gonna be stuck in a quiet room. I love them both and I'll never give them up but I'll have them on the weekend or in the evening, just not in the morning. Normal tea is fine for me.

â¢ No alcohol: I don't drink the night before a lecture or meeting. I can drink after fine, but before makes my stomach unhappy.

â¢ Psyllium Husk pills and lots of H2O: Fibre pills are a godsend for my stomach. I like to think they suck up all that gas lying around in your intestines lol. But they really do work as long as you take them with lots and lots of water and you keep on a routine! Start off with one, it took my stomach like a week to adjust then take two a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Evening is too late for me. I use the Solgar ones and they're great.

I hope that helps you as much as it did me. No amount of fad diets, exercise, magic minty yeast killing enzyme boosting pills helped me. You can try, everyone's different but all my efforts ended up in an expensive failure. 

If I had known all this 10 years ago, I may have still had a good social life, excelled my exams because I actually stayed and did them, and maybe ended up with a bit more confidence and happiness.

So if any of it helps you the way it does for me now I'll be truly delighted. I don't want anyone to waste years being fearful of their own body, it's a horrible thing that not many people understand.

Good luck! â¤"
zoloft,ffqaxl2,t3_ep1t41,1580128700.0,"I had the exact same problem with zoloft. It literally made me crazy for 6 weeks and that was on the lowest dose possible. I had good episodes, mixed episodes and seriously depressed episodes.

Psychiatrist suggested I may have bipolar and to try mirtazapine. No bad episodes yet but that's because I'm still on the low dose (15mg) and I'm tired ALL the time. I'm curious to see if my episodes come back once the dose is increased. 

What dose are you on?"
bipolar2,ffda96q,t1_ffd9j1s,1579816506.0,"Okay that's fair, I understand what it's like to feel like a burden, it's the worst. You don't want to lean on someone too much but at the same time you wish there was someone you could just pour your heart out to without any judgement.

Can you take a break from reality first? Take a few days off your job, go for a walk if the weather's nice, take long hot showers, watch your favourite movies, eat your favorite foods...really treat yourself for a couple of days. If you still don't feel good after that, then at least you tried and maybe then consider hospital?

Sorry I can't offer much more advice but I really hope everything works out for you â¤"

depressionregimens,ffcagmv,t1_fdycy9k,1579795205.0,"Like you, I'm in the UK. I just wanna say that the crisis team isn't even worth ringing. I'm on the wait list for my local psychiatric team but like you was given a list of numbers to ring if there were any problems.

Was put on mirtazapine a few days ago and had a bad episode (potential bipolar disorder to be diagnosed), called up the crisis team (took 5 tries before I got an answer) and they told me to go onto YouTube, try some mindfulness videos and if that didn't work then call them back. Ended up staying awake all night trying to deal with the episode myself.

The NHS is ridiculous but at least it's free I guess.."
bipolar2,ffc7xps,t3_esugqk,1579793600.0,"Is there anyone else you could reach out to even just to hear some kind comforting words?
You know yourself better than anyone else and if you think that you need help getting out of this depression, you go ahead and do what needs to be done. 

It sounds like your partner may not understand how bad you're feeling but unless she offers to help you with what you're going through, you're going to have to take steps to do what will make you happy again.
Would she rather you didn't go to the hospital and stay feeling depressed?"

ADHD,fe3eh7k,t3_enpkj4,1578848543.0,"I try not to put a time limit on tasks in my to-do list. The main reason being, if I don't get it done in the allotted time, I get upset, irritable and I usually end up giving up on the entire list. 

I'm also old school in that I have a shopping list notepad for my lists. You know the narrow, lined ones where the pages can easily be pulled out? I love physically ticking or crossing out what I've done. And less chance of my phone distracting me.

I write out my to do list the night before so I don't have to wake up and stress about thinking and writing.
