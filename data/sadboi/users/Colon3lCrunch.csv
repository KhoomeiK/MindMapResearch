BipolarReddit,fjbjro5,t1_fjbircb,1583194859.0,If he's getting back on meds that's a really good start. It sounds like you're a good support system which is really helpful especially when starting up meds because you never know how they're gonna effect you. Keep doing what you're doing asking how he's doing and if he needs anything. Having someone to talk to can be a huge help but at times but occasionally you both may need space. I know I have times where I just need my space and when my wife or friends keep asking if I'm ok can get a little frustrating at times. Its totally ok to wanna help and be concerned just try to keep from pushing the issue to much. You're an awesome friend for helping out like you are. Just keep doing what you're doing and if you can make sure he stays up on his meds. I wish you both the best.
BipolarReddit,fjbel5l,t3_fchvk3,1583191561.0,I've been dealing with my diagnosis for a little over a year now and I'm still getting used to it. I also have family who are bipolar. It can difficult at times but it can be managed. If you have any questions you'd like to ask please feel free.
