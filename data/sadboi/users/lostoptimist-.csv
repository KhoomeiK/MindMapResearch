DissociaDID,fpfhb6a,t1_fpffexk,1588571238.0,"If a pedophile only watches videos or looks at photos, they‚Äôre not hurting a child, right? They didn‚Äôt touch them. Except they did hurt them, because their consumption of that media expresses a desire for that media. 

The problem with displays of child pornography or inappropriate adult relationships in fiction is that they can make it seem normal. It still perpetuates the fetish and puts it out there for a wider audience. Most people probably don‚Äôt progress past watching a cartoon girl that acts or looks like a minor have a relationship with an adult in an anime (which I personally still think is super creepy anyway), but for others, that could only be a starting point. It obviously doesn‚Äôt hurt the fictional character, but that character could be the gateway to an actual child later on."
DissociaDID,fpfapc6,t3_gd454l,1588565933.0,"Drawing underage characters in adult situations is child porn, regardless of reality or nationality. It is not acceptable in any medium. It‚Äôs not normal - it‚Äôs normalized (in some contexts), and that‚Äôs heinous. 

As far as Nan and the community go, like...we‚Äôre talking about a group of people who were all severely traumatized as children. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre being overly sensitive by distancing themselves from someone who created art like that. It‚Äôs true that, sometimes, those effected by childhood abuse can sometimes grow up to repeat it. Things that are not healthy or normal are normalized in their mind because of their traumatic upbringing. **This is not always the case, of course** but it can happen. While I do not personally think Nan had any malicious intent, their art triggered a reaction and the people effected are valid in wanting to protect themselves.

**Edit:** Adding links I referenced in a later post, in case anyone else is curious. The original post was discussing sexualized minors in anime/the culture of sexulizing young girls in Japan.

For some people, hookups make emotional sense and they‚Äôre able to enjoy it. For others, they want a deeper emotional connection and end up feeling empty after. It‚Äôs all just personality traits. 

That being said, I wholeheartedly agree with you about men not being encouraged to experience their emotions. Toxic masculinity is so deeply woven into our culture that a lot of people believe the only way to be a man is to be physically strong and be the breadwinner and never show their feelings. I can imagine how invalidating that feels for men who don‚Äôt fit into that. Everyone I know (female and male friends) is fighting against that as much as anything else. Hopefully that culture will start to change. 

As far as women having an easier time, I also think you‚Äôre right. Women that want to find someone to have sex with hold some power because the female form has historically been objectified and idolized in a very unhealthy way, so if they‚Äôre offering it up, people come running. Unfortunately, it also means that they receive that attention even when they don‚Äôt want it. If they run into the wrong person, that can be dangerous or even deadly. I would rather get no attention than have to worry which person might be unstable enough to hurt me for sex. Are most of the guys out there just good guys looking for connection? Yes.

I‚Äôve definitely met some really cool guys that felt like no one was into them, but usually there were some people who were just too shy to say something. I think it‚Äôs super cool that you want to help guys with their confidence. A lot of the time men aren‚Äôt encouraged to open up about insecurities and that just makes it all worse. But I don‚Äôt think confidence should be based solely around how many women he can pull, either. People should be confident for themselves - good people will respond to that so long as they‚Äôre putting themselves out there. Confidence based on other people‚Äôs perception can be shaky. (Edit) I think that‚Äôs the kind of thing that makes rejection harder to take too, but people have to be able to say no. Not everyone is going to like everyone - that‚Äôs just not realistic."
dating_advice,fopphym,t1_fopp2ah,1587968029.0,"I just try to avoid people that would want to push me around lol. I don‚Äôt vibe with shit like that. I‚Äôm down to compromise but to a point, people are who they are. Your core self shouldn‚Äôt be ignored or changed just for the sake of companionship because that shit is NOT fulfilling lol. I learned that lesson around 25 after a 3-year relationship. Ever since that, I tend to just put myself out there exactly as I am when I go on dates - playing coy or whatever just draws out shit that isn‚Äôt ever going to be anything. In my experience, at least. I‚Äôm actually a woman though so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
dating_advice,fopoptg,t1_fopobgn,1587967367.0,"I‚Äôve gone through some of that same shit. For me, I realized in retrospect that my partner and I weren‚Äôt communicating the way we should have been and we grew apart. I also had a bad habit of changing to fit what they thought I was and I just wasn‚Äôt happy. Now I focus most of my time on myself and the things I like to do. I typically go on dates with and get to know the people I meet though those interests, and it‚Äôs much less messy now that I know who I am. There‚Äôs no time wasted when you know what you want."
dating_advice,fopnupi,t1_fopniib,1587966636.0,"It sounds like you went through some rough shit in your twenties and now you‚Äôre on the other side, living the way you want. That‚Äôs awesome. That‚Äôs fucking hard to do. Your view just isn‚Äôt mine, but I‚Äôm not unhappy for it. We go through life different ways. I‚Äôm glad you and your girl are happy!"
dating_advice,fopmytj,t1_fopmnh1,1587965904.0,"It sounds like that‚Äôs what works for you and the people you‚Äôre into, so that‚Äôs cool. All I‚Äôm saying is that people are different (regardless of gender) and different things work depending on the person. For me, a person‚Äôs general desirability is irrelevant. If this advice goes against what‚Äôs working for you, it‚Äôs not for you. This is just a different view that I don‚Äôt think everyone thinks about."
dating_advice,fopmlol,t1_foplu5k,1587965609.0,"If a person doesn‚Äôt like you without the games, then it‚Äôs not really genuine my dude. Not every person is going to like you, even if you like them - it sucks, but that‚Äôs just the truth. A strong, healthy relationship is built on mutual interest and understanding. Of course a person won‚Äôt be with you if they don‚Äôt want to sleep with you, but why would you want someone who doesn‚Äôt want you? It‚Äôs all quality over quantity. That can suck too. I‚Äôve only had 2 real relationships in 29 years and it‚Äôs pretty lonely sometimes, but I‚Äôd rather go through the world as myself with no bullshit and wait for someone that compliments that."
dating_advice,fopm5p9,t1_foplos0,1587965241.0,"I‚Äôm 29 my guy and none of the people around me are like that at all. If any dude comes up trying to pull lines or play games, that‚Äôs a no-go. It‚Äôs in-genuine. We‚Äôre not about it. Like, ultimately, you do you. If what you‚Äôre putting out is vibing with people you like, then cool. This whole post is about how different people respond to different approaches. I just personally think it‚Äôs toxic that some men only start conversations with women in order to fuck - it‚Äôs objectifying and, in extreme cases, dangerous."
dating_advice,fopllyl,t1_fop61ft,1587964793.0,"Never said to change. You should treat everyone you meet with the same level of kindness, and be open to learning about them as people. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre a man or a woman. If you start conversations based on your interests and who you are, the people who vibe with you will want to know you better."

dating_advice,foomh0e,t1_foolx4v,1587941930.0,"Ah, that‚Äôs good to hear! Some of the comments on confidence he‚Äôs talking about in this talk are good too, so I can see how he‚Äôd be helpful in that aspect. I‚Äôll keep looking into it!"
writing,foom85a,t3_g8a89p,1587941786.0,"The number one thing I always remind myself is that critics can only offer you their opinion. They are one person, with one way of thinking. Maybe some suggestions they make will help you get to where you want your piece to go, some won‚Äôt. A good critic will not expect you to take every word they say as law. I used to be horrified at the thought of criticism, but now it‚Äôs one of my favorite parts of my writing process. They‚Äôre not questioning your talent, they‚Äôre helping you hone it!"
dating_advice,fook9xk,t1_fooj048,1587940645.0,"I just looked up this talk and, from what I can tell, he‚Äôs doing exactly what I‚Äôm suggesting to not do. It seems like his entire stance is male vs. female role, and he preaches about How To Talk To Women. I didn‚Äôt personally feel like he was talking about women as people at any point."
dating_advice,foogt0v,t3_g8ifh5,1587938696.0,I feel that. It gets to a point where I‚Äôm like ‚Äúis anything I‚Äôm saying even worth it??‚Äù I start feeling like a cardboard cut-out after a while.
Dreams,fomf5vn,t1_fomeqgg,1587887788.0,"Interesting üßêThis could possibly apply. It‚Äôs an unsettling environment to be be in, isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs so odd that such an eerie place is supposed to be you."
Dreams,fomddq1,t3_g85ima,1587886005.0,"I once had a dream that I was hanging out with this girl beneath an overpass and in the dream, I knew this was the perfect person for me. I really felt the separation when I woke up - it was the strangest feeling."
writing,fombu3z,t3_g880mz,1587884505.0,"I‚Äôm currently working on a feature that has both a rape and an unsuccessful suicide attempt in it so....yes lol. I can definitely relate. I‚Äôve always been drawn to telling tough stories that people don‚Äôt normally discuss, and I‚Äôve had a few people ask how I was doing after reading something I wrote. If it‚Äôs really not connected to your own feelings at all, then give yourself a pat on the back! You obviously did a good job portraying your character!"
writing,foman3g,t3_g86fum,1587883396.0,"Ask yourself questions about where your character is, and be specific. Is it hot? Cold? Is the air clear? Is this place familiar, or do they need to explore? How much space do they have? You can also experiment with putting yourself in different places and focusing on the little ways each setting effects you."
dating_advice,fom8j6r,t3_g8633r,1587881483.0,"I‚Äôve been having so many mixed feelings about it. Being single right now is lonely, but I‚Äôve been single for about 5 years now so it‚Äôs not too different from life as normal. I guess the big thing is not knowing when things will be normal. I‚Äôm getting all this extra time and space to work on my shit, but no idea when I‚Äôll get to move on. Probably going to move smoothly into a 6th year üôÑ"
childfree,fo8u51g,t3_g61261,1587603891.0,"I completely, totally agree. I‚Äôm 29, so a lot of my friends are starting to have kids and in all of their bliss, they fully cannot comprehend my strained interest lol. I‚Äôm genuinely happy for them but I just don‚Äôt get it. I also recently had a male classmate say that it was ‚Äúsuch a waste‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt want children. So my own happiness and fulfillment is a waste?? Cool, glad to know ü§™"
childfree,fo8saxu,t3_g60f6c,1587602804.0,"I‚Äôve been through this with both of my best friends - they each had kids and our friendships changed dramatically. I‚Äôm not a kid person at all and can‚Äôt relate at all to a really big part of their life. I think it‚Äôs okay to have some complicated feelings about that. I also think it‚Äôs important to be honest about those feelings with your friend, to an extent. 

As far as the guy...unfortunately, when it comes to things like that, you can only do so much. She will ultimately do what she‚Äôs going to do. You can give her advice and be around for support if she decides to leave. One of my best friends is in a marriage that I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs going to stay in and she comes to me for advice here and there, but I don‚Äôt tell her to leave him. I think that‚Äôs too big and scary sometimes. I just reinforce what I know about her, and what I observe, and that she deserves to be her best self."
