The social security system is a mess! 

OP could have also potentially had the option for disability through one of their positions, especially the full-time position(s). If the person chooses not to apply, that Is their prerogative. 

A third option might be that they didn’t know they had benefits they could try and get. That seems to be what happens A LOT. People think that there are no options for them in the system because they are working or not terminally ill, paralyzed, etc. As everyone else has said in this thread, the stigma of receiving government benefits has been destroyed and needs to be recovered because it is there for a reason, our tax dollars are being used to implement these programs and should be taken advantage of by those who need them."

I decided to do what was best for me for once and so I went to the hospital.

I remember I stayed over night; the first night was horrible because when I was admitted there was already one girl there and then two more girls showed up in the middle of the night so it was very chaotic. I didn’t have my medicine the first night, but I got it back once we were all settled in. 

I didn’t have my phone which threw me off at first just because I’ve learned that my phone helps me to distract myself from the thousands of thoughts going on in my head at any given moment. To fight this I read some books! That helped clear my mind a lot, actually. 


Having the ability to design what I wanted for breakfast, lunch and dinner was nice and made me feel grateful. I have some degree of control in my home life, but being in that calm environment was so nice. 

The group therapy sessions were fun, but I liked when we worked on crafts. I made a vision board for 2018 (this was right before Thanksgiving in 2017) and I tried to do one for 2019 here recently but it fell through. 

I think I might make another one.

Diablo,f0wjcyy,t1_f0vzcm5,1569008507.0,"I think the Mystic would be neat to explore. Although if I had the choice I would probably go with the Artificer. I always manage to play as some kind of mage or something that casts magic. The idea of taking it to a technical, scientific level is something that I’m totally down for."
BipolarReddit,f0wiw29,t3_d6x3lb,1569008289.0,"Oh, wow. I have been through this many times myself so it is nice to see (although the situation sucks) that there are others out there like me. I try my best to feel compassion but I seem to be the most compassionate is when I am off my medicine. That’s also when I feel the least compassionate as well though so I’m not sure how to tackle that."

It's just too much, and to see over a 60% reduction in cost with similar data priority and speeds I think would be worth it. If you're going the AT&T route, Cricket isn't bad either especially for the price."

I’ve started to see myself depressed, happy, Angry. Either I want to do it all or I don’t want to anything. Also my brain never settles down and it causes insomnia and anxiety. My Effexor (Venlafaxine) has been awesome to me, but I understand what You man and I’m sorry you can’t take it."

You can enable auto-pay, but you do not have to do this. It is possible to purchase more minutes online or you should be able to do it through the app(s)."
