Also as her letter to Annie indicates, their sacrifice will pale compared to the reward."

Anyway, you’re not alone."

Hereditary,fmpb24g,t3_fwfqq4,1586277677.0,"I think she did it because she knew there’d potentially be drinking at the party. She tells him not to drink, kinda knowing that it’d be present. 

I don’t agree with this, but I knew friends growing up that their parents would do this. If we went to movies or the mall it wasn’t uncommon that friends would have a younger sibling tag along."

ptsd,fl4mj32,t1_fl4mblq,1584816753.0,I guess that’s what I’m doing too. I guess I feel like I used to be funny and talkative and social and I’m the opposite now. I don’t like it.

Hereditary,ff39div,t3_erajhg,1579536765.0,"I think Peter was in shock when it happened. He mouths “Are you ok?” But he knows that answer already. 
Charlie’s death was planned by the cult. When they’re driving to the party, we see that same post with the mark of paimon on it. 
The dollhouses just show that something is going on beyond the family’s control, that something larger than this family is in control. 
And yes, the body needs to be vulnerable for Paimon to possess, so Annie was definitely vulnerable after watching her husband go up in flames. Paimon was also known as beibg mischievous, so he tricked Annie into thinking she’d go up in flames and instead took her husband. 
I read a theory here once that said whenever we see the color red, that Paimon is present. After Charlie dies, we see the red brake lights, the red light in the treehouse when the heater is on, etc. I love rewatching and catching things I missed."

Hereditary,f2bibgq,t3_dcuqbg,1570126813.0,"Annie explains in the movie that she & her mother were no contact when Peter was born. When Charlie was born, her mother insisted on feeding Charlie, which is when she could put that herb in her milk."
