I tend to be extremely against asking people for help even if I’m suffering and he’s always reminding me that requesting aid isn’t a sign of weakness.

Being around his family also made me realize how dysfunctional mine was. I went to his family reunion and it was a lovely event where everyone had a great time and his entire family treated me like a person. In the first 24 hours meeting my parents he had to physically get between my mother and I to stop her from verbally assaulting me. 

Still he’s a champ and the whole situation has given us both a much better understanding of each other. Plus I now have a super fantastic secondary family I get to spend the holidays with!"

Most research labs will want to get you in ASAP for scans because it’s generally very hard to find participants.

You are stronger than this experience. The road to recovery is filled with horrific lows and set backs, but it really does get better. The problem with ptsd is a lot of the damage is internal and to the psyche which can make it particularly hard to treat. 

I struggled like you are with having reasonable expectations of myself. I compared myself to my friends who were healthy, which is a recipe for disappointment and frustration because we are hurt. 

I had to focus on changing my mindset about my recovery. I’d constantly ask myself if I’d have the same expectations of someone who just lost an arm in an accident or would I have these same expectations of a loved one in the same circumstances? The answer was most often no. 

Treating my ptsd as I would a physical ailment or a friend’s ptsd really helped me not only understand my healing process, but work towards recovery.

NarcissisticAbuse,er60804,t3_c0lfki,1560537158.0,"TLDR at bottom. 

Yes! We were talking about the crazy experiences I had in my first apartment and mentioned how I had once made out with my best friend in a drunken dare. 

Some context, my bf is a gay man in a committed relationship and that kiss was the furthest he’s ever been with a woman. Also I’ve known him for 8 years and more importantly HE (my narc ex) had known my bf the entire time we’d been dating since my bf and I lived together for most of the duration of my ex’s and I’s relationship. Also my ex was present for many of the occasions in which my bf would bring dudes home. 

Also my ex had always been aggressive about my relationship with my bf. He hated that I called our weekly hang out “date night”, and didn’t like how my bf called out his shitty behavior. So he festers on this bit of information and waits until my bf invites me to a work holiday party as his date. 

Low and behold my ex pulled out all the stops! He mapped out how that little kiss years ago caused my bf to become straight. That bringing the guys home to have sex was all just a ploy to allow me to grow more comfortable around my bf. That this holiday party was the final round in this long game of hooking up with me and that my bf was going to get me drunk and rape me!  My ex told me I wasn’t allowed to see my bf again because he “cared” about my safety and didn’t want me to get raped. 

I had always told my narc ex to never ask me to choose between himself and my bf. It was in that moment as he was mapping out this plan that I realized his lunacy. It was the final nail in the coffin and we broke up. 

To this day my friend and I continue to joke about his “long game” to sleep with me. 

TLDR

Narc ex finds out I once made out with gay BF and tries to use it as proof that BF has been secretly trying to sleep with me the entire time. Narc ex asks me to choose between him and BF and I picked my BF."
