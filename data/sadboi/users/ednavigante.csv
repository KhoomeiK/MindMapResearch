Personally I've used nicotine chewing gum for anti-anxiety. I've never smoked, but a friend used it and said it calmed them down. Smoking is obviously definitely bad, but nicotine itself doesn't have the same health issues (definitely still addictive mind... I would only have one or two a day if I was stressed and anxious, but probably wouldn't advise it for someone who is looking for  a thing to use every day...)."

Totally worthless answer, sure.

I had really bad depression when I was working in a lab- it was work where you had to self motivated and get on with stuff. I felt like a fraud who didn't know what he was doing.

I left, moved to the countryside and got a job in an outdoor equipment shop. It was definitely still stressful at times, but everyone was relaxed, I knew what I was talking about, and I made a load of friends.

Obviously not saying everyone should do that, but maybe working in a music store might be good for you? It's great to be able to talk to people about something you know about and can feel like you're really able to help.

Also, often in retail you can ask for fewer shifts, and so if you feel it's being too restrictive you can cut back a bit. 

I know retail doesn't pay well, but it definitely made  me feel more able to cope with life. Might not for you, but I hope that helps"

I know that if I can push through the pain and get things clean I can keep it that way, but it's starting it that's most difficult. 

Good luck!"
