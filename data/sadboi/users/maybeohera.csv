depression,ezy1qwk,t1_ezxpiek,1568255347.0,"She asked me about my life and the things that I used to do or like. I was encouraged time and time again to try them out and see what happened. So I could talk more about it in the next week on our appointments and talk about how it made me feel and whatever happened. At the start it didn't help much, mostly because I felt like it was a waste of time, but from time to time I could feel something like a spark.

I scheduled a psychiatrist too, and started taking medications. It was really hard because of the side effects. But I was really anxious all the time and it drained every bit of life I had in myself. If I was not worried about tomorrow, I was regretting something in the past. So I had literally no time for being ""here"". I did not allow myself to live, mostly. I would crush with just thoughts any desire or curiosity.

I can't say what did help me the most, but I do believe that the combination of both treatments helped me a lot to not give up on myself. 

That I could change, and I did. It's been a really long year since I started the whole thing and much has changed.

It's really hard work, but now I can say that I'm really proud of myself.

I plan on graduating this year or maybe next semester. Wish me luck. 

And I wish you the best."
depression,ezwgue0,t3_d2pnl8,1568216366.0,"It happened to me. I forgot the things I used to do or enjoy, so I went to a therapist and asked her to help me to remember myself. And that's what we've been mainly doing this past year since I found her. It changed my life. She is really helpful and kind to me.

Reach out to someone you can feel safe, try out a few therapists if you can. But most importantly, embrace yourself so you can find yourself again. Be kind whenever you can.

Healing it's a slow process and I know you can heal as well."
