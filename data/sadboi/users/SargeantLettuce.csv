TwoXChromosomes,fqxj070,t3_gl2bxe,1589733043.0,"That's your problem.  Rape, and serial assault are NOT female related issues specific to females.  Neither is domestic abuse.  Female specific issues would be like my friends complaining of their boobs hurting or morning sickness while pregnant, fuck the patriarchy with how expensive period hygiene products are, and the VERY REAL pay inequality.

Rape (m2m, f2m),serial assault, and domestic abuse happen to women more but that does not mean these are exclusive to your sex nor should we say they are related to your sex because they happen more to women.

Try being a man who says he was taken advantage of when drunk (fun fact: your penis going up does not equal consent) or was punched in the face repeatedly by their girlfriend and being afraid to protect yourself because ""guys can't hit girls"" or being coerced into doing something because if not she'll go to the police and say you assaulted her. You're laughed at, the idea that a man can be raped or assaulted by women is so hard for our culture to wrap their head around it is seen as near impossible when someone claims to be.  Societal awareness my ass.

Everyone deserves to rant here but if you want to not be scrutinized by the public seeing your post online write an email to yourself.  You are guaranteed to agree with how frustrating it is and your own opinions.  Win-win.

That he feels bad about it afterwards and you comfort him is no different than beating you senseless then crying and saying he's sorry. 

You can love someone who is threatening to your very life at a distance.  Tigers are cool and sometimes sweet and cuddly with their handlers but the moment they want something they will tear through you to get it.  He is a tiger.  There is no taming him or changing him.  He has lovable qualities and will tear through your ass to get what he wants or lash out uncontrollably when backed into a corner or feels threatened.  He will likely feel threatened when you leave him.

Your Mom is useless and don't depend on her.  There are groups in your area.  Reach out. Accept the help, and know he will be crying, begging, saying sorry to the ends of the earth.  Block him on all media.  You will be sorely tempted to go back with his promises of changing how he treats you and shows you his lovable side.

It's not your place and there is so much roomfor him to lie you won't be believed.  She will find out on her own.  Other than that keep him blocked. Some men are pigs.

bipolar,fqn9rxe,t1_fqn3y9f,1589491082.0,"Yeah I agree, completely.  My psychiatrist, after about 5 years seeing her, recommended once I try a different medicine  for bipolar ""because it worked for her"".  I took that to mean she experiences bipolar, too.  She then told me ""the sensation of explosive, impulsive joy and vibrancy you feel when manic is only equaled or exceeded by the inverse inevitable deepest depression.""    Really hit home and is in the top 5 of deepest truths I know.  I've always been reasonably good at taking my meds but this brought me to 100% for YEARS now.

As long as you've taken your meds and have gotten enough sleep you CAN relax enough to feel happy up to (for me) about a 7...sometimes an 8.  So instead of my -5 to 15/10 range unmedicated it's now between 4 and 7/8.  

Honestly I don't know, but am very curious, if we rate our emotional highs NOT caused from chemical imbalance so low because we rate our top spectrum higher than neurological normative people having experienced the highs of mania. 

Regardless, not half the time wanting to kill myself, just waiting for a moment of impulse to just DO it, for YEARS now is worth the cost I pay each month."

I still am fearful of strong positive emotions but the slow burn of knowing I love and am loved, coupled with knowing I can keep a modicum of stability and be happy has made a future I never imagined 8 years ago when diagnosed. 

Knowing my triggers and taking my medication always has helped me more than anything.   I feel people who stop taking their meds because they feel a sense of stability return ao don't need them are doing themselves wrong.

With therapy and having taken, consistently, my meds for so long I can honestly say that mania is the most intense,  wonderful feeling Ive ever had, outshined by the suicidal depression that follows in equal if not disproportionately long measure.
