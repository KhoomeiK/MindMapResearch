depression,fc9eqae,t3_egptaw,1577551557.0,"This is how I felt last year and still sometimes now. I forced my parents to take me to the doctor because I finally got exhausted of sleeping so much and feeling like a piece of shit. The first anti depressant I went on make me sleep a lot and eat a lot, gained 40 pounds in like two months. I’m now on a different anti depressant that doesn’t seem to have the same side effects and it’s going strong. Haven’t passed out as soon as I get home or slept from 3pm to 6am in a while. 

I’d like to recommend talking to a doctor and if your parents won’t let you, tell them how you feel even if it means they ridicule you for it."
depression,fblyaeq,t3_edpkii,1576973452.0,Most defiantly. I describe it as irrational anger. It can be helped when taking certain antidepressants.
GFD,fbegcyu,t1_fbe1ci7,1576785101.0,Go ahead and save it if you’d like to.
