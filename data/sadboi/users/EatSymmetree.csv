ADHD,fo7c3td,t3_g63m6v,1587575805.0,"Personally, I don't think a higher dosage would be better for you if you already have bad come downs. You're still in the early stages of your diagnosis and finding the right medication for you. Your doc might suggest trying an instant release instead of extended. This helps with anxiety too since they only last 3-4 hours and if you don't like it you don't have to take the afternoon dose."

I think it's important to find what motivates you personally and make it one of those habits that you do without thinking, like getting out of bed to pee, but since you're here brush your teeth and wash your face. 

Also, I don't let myself check social media until I'm at my desk and also checking emails and turning on music. Music is a big motivator if you need outside stimuli!"

ADHD,fmwi5ol,t3_fxsw48,1586447012.0,"I read in a study about ADHD that our brains take a little extra time to process things, like a lag in retaining info. But even though it takes us more time to do some things, our minds are working faster than most- this was shown as people with ADHD not being able to keep a slow and steady beat to a metronome, and taking a fraction of a second longer to put individual pieces of puzzles together."
adderall,fmweop6,t3_fxnspk,1586445226.0,"Similar story, but I was never prescribed stimulants before adulthood. My psychiatrist gave me antidepressants (to also treat anxiety) and monitored me for about 6 months before she started giving me Ritalin. She did this so my anxiety wouldn't get worse while taking the stims since I was never prescribed before. But ADHD also runs in my family, and she diagnosed me as having ADHD in our first session. I recommend starting asking for those consent forms so your old doctor can tell your new doc your medical history."
ADHD,fmscvic,t3_fx32e7,1586352730.0,"Tell your doctor how you feel on it, tell them how much you can get accomplished! You'll do fine, if you're already prescribed they won't take you off of it just like that."
ADHD,fmsbkwh,t3_fx5r3e,1586351863.0,"First off I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I have social anxiety too, pretty mild though so I can't imagine what you must be going through. ADHD medication can increase anxiety, so it sounds like you should find a different doctor- a psychiatrist who understands that you should treat your anxiety first so the ritalin can start to do its job. 
High school isn't forever, and one day I hope you can get paid for your art. Please go easy on yourself. Of course you feel agitated when someone asks you to do something and you can't. ADHD brains need rewards to help the motivation, so try to set simple goals with really big rewards."

ADHD,fmlnb47,t1_fmlgfqx,1586189701.0,"Hard to say, since the parent is the one to pass the ADHD down.

you have the right idea"
ADHD,fmlgdxa,t3_fvzplz,1586185885.0,"Welcome! People with ADHD feel like they have always been different, and that feeling doesn't go away. I recommend checking out r/ADHDAlien 

And the same goes for figuring out ""what's wrong with me"". I must have recommended a dozen other diagnoses to my psychiatrist, and the angel goes along with it and tells me it's normal to seek an answer for why I feel this way."

ADHD,fmlfdsy,t3_fvz6v4,1586185301.0,I feel you. Perhaps it's their way of dealing with this stressful time because to non-ADHD brains it's *still* new. And ADHD brains have accepted and moved on and need to find solutions/ new topics because why are you guys so slow we can't linger we must keep moving!
ADHD,fmlenz8,t1_fmlaw2j,1586184889.0,"I like your passion for this topic. I do think it's a mix of nature and nurture just like everything else in our personalities. ADHD runs in my family and the ones that have it have trouble sleeping. It's not that we don't try, but we have a hard time staying asleep. I've noticed that we all can fall asleep early most of the time and even take plenty of naps, but either constantly wake up in the night or wake up early. This is the 'nature' part of sleep and ADHD. 

The 'nurture' side is how we let it affect us. One person in my family was raised on a farm, so once he wakes up at 4 am he's up and has to be productive. He's go-go-go, switching tasks, running, etc. then naps and gets quiet time. 

Another person wakes up at 4 am and scrolls their phone a couple of hours before falling asleep again. Can't get out of bed because 'so tired but so awake' and lets anxiety and depression set in. Medication helps functionality in this modern society. 

So I definitely think ADHD is the way our brains are at birth, but the way we deal with our sleep can of course affect us in the long term. Maybe you're a night owl- that's cool. I hope you can make it work for you!"
ADHD,fmlbtps,t3_fvww51,1586183223.0,"Personally, I don't like to sleep with mine. I do like to use it when I'm anxious to either put on my legs while on the couch or wrap it around me to have the weight on my shoulders. It keeps me pretty still!"

adderall,fm909px,t3_fts78t,1585859290.0,"Love all the comments here so far- listen to them. I also want to add that I'm getting a hint that you snort your Adderall bc of your username. Don't do that, you'll get random nose bleeds long after you stop snorting. Also, only a doctor can diagnose you so definitely talk to someone about what you're experiencing. But a big factor in knowing if you have ADHD (inattentive or hyper or combo) is if it affects you negatively in at least 2 of the 3 areas- home, school/work, and social life- not just math class (but I feel this lol). 
It's definitely worth talking to a doctor since overwhelming emotions and anxiety are a big symptom of ADHD, but it could also be a different diagnosis."

askatherapist,fkolr5z,t3_fjo3d1,1584389737.0,"(not a therapist). Don't be afraid to see a therapist, their job is to help you with whatever it is you're struggling with. They see all sorts of people and do not judge. Also, all drugs are different. So by you telling a therapist of your past habits, it's not like you won't get treatment if you break your arm. It just means that your therapist knows you have addictive tendencies and will help you work through it. I went through drug abuse with opiods, and my psychiatrist still prescribed me adhd medication once she knew I was ready."

depression,fkokaf6,t3_fjowci,1584388904.0,"Hey there. I'm so sorry to hear that you've struggled this much. Unfortunately, sometimes depression is from an imbalanced brain and trauma, and not what we have/ how we look compared to others. It's good to know that you have been able to be productive and hold jobs and keep friends. If you believe you have treatment-resistant depression ( since you've tried over 20 antidepressants) you can look into the benefits of ketamine treatment. The FDA approved a nasal spray for this, which has esketamine (part of ketamine).  Or, there are clinics that offer ketamine treatments targeted around treating depression for patients who have tried almost everything else. It worked for my friend, I believe it's worth researching."
depression,fkoidym,t1_fkof8c7,1584387829.0,"I completely understand. You can try to think about it like this- it took me 3 meetings with different people to find someone I felt comfortable with. You can do a test run with someone you don't particularly want to start therapy with, just to start the process. Most therapists will have a short phone call with you (for free) before your first appointment to see if you guys are a good fit. Knowing you may never talk with this person again but still asking relevant questions about therapy will make the next time a little easier."

depression,fkognaj,t1_fko4bbv,1584386837.0,"Sorry to hear. And yes we're all different, but I'll share my case. I'm diagnosed with major depression, social anxiety, and ADHD. Knowing this, my psychiatrist prescribed me Luvox which is mainly for social anxiety, but since it's an SSRI it helped block my depressive thoughts in a way. I'm also on Ritalin for ADHD, which helps my motivation, focus, and working memory. Luvox can make you sleepy, so I take it at night. I take Ritalin twice a day- once in the morning and once midday."
depression,fkofzsm,t1_fko47rq,1584386464.0,"Yes definitely. I've been in and out of doctors' offices for almost 10 years.

Tbh I was ignoring this sub for a while because I was scared of thinking about depression, but that's just what I needed for the moment. I'll try and start commenting and posting more often, I just don't want to make others jealous, annoyed, or more depressed thinking of what they don't have.

ADHD,fkeomgh,t1_fkek9zg,1584117484.0,"I'm prescribed Luvox for social anxiety (which I was on for about 6 months getting to the right dose while starting therapy) and now I'm taking Ritalin (methylphenidate) for ADHD. My psychiatrist said that once I'm used to it, I can switch to Concerta which is the extended-release option- with Ritalin, it starts working almost immediately and only lasts about 4 hours. 

And I agree, it definitely helps ease the mind to know where it came from and how your body and mind show it because there are different ways. I got it from my mom's side, too. Though, members of my family show it differently than I do because of the way we learn to hide or cope with our symptoms. Such as always being way too early for appointments because of terrible time management and getting in trouble for being late or forgetting. Talk therapy helped me to learn to justify my ""odd behavior"" because it helped me realize that I have these learned behaviors that used to work for me as a kid when I experienced an adverse childhood, but they're not effective anymore. Thus, less anxiety and more potential to learn new skills."
ADHD,fkemocr,t1_fkeg5cc,1584116347.0,"Thank you! I do have a counselor who talks with my psychiatrist often. Therapy definitely helped my anxiety get to a level where I felt comfortable taking medicine without worrying too much about side effects. I'm working on being in the present moment as much as I can and setting attainable goals.

 SSRIs have different effects on different people. Finding the right medication can be a long process, especially because it takes 2 weeks to a month for your body to stabilize (get used to the drug). It is possible that an SSRI starts a manic episode if the person does in fact have bipolar disorder. (It's also important to know that a manic episode can look different from person to person). It is also possible that the person experiences more depression if they are an adolescent on some medications.  So finding the right one can be a hard journey. 
When I lived with my parents and was going through some tough mental issues, I experienced some of the things you mentioned. I just want you to know that it's important to give her space, and also let her know that you love her no matter what. Don't push her to talk. Sometimes talking about it can be extremely difficult. Just come from a place of love and trust and let her know you will always be there for her, and that she's not alone."

Painting your nails/ toe nails to focus on something, then you can't do anything while they're wet. 
Snapping a rubber band on your wrist."
HaircareScience,evwyzrz,t1_evw6r2a,1564877235.0,Yes I've used overtone many times and it definitely works!

Anxiety,evbgbyb,t3_cj5fn6,1564376340.0,"This happens to me esp with animals, even pictures on Reddit. I have to distract myself immediately or I go into a crying episode."
HaircareScience,evan8rc,t3_civfet,1564352053.0,"Yeah you could dilute them while you're using up what you have! And it sounds like you need some deep conditioner if your hair is super tangly when wet, products with argan oil are great. Also, you may be using the wrong brush for your dry hair. Try a wide tooth comb maybe? I know that helped my hair from being so fluffy."
HaircareScience,ev9wmxa,t3_ciwfl8,1564333082.0,"I've been bleaching my hair a while, and my hair stylist told me yes tree shampoo will dry out my hair and will make my color fade faster. It might be different for you if you don't bleach, but I'd stay safe and use shampoo for color, esp if you just got it done."
HaircareScience,ev9w9qb,t3_civfet,1564332823.0,"You could try using a more natural shampoo, or even a no-poo such as an apple cider vinegar shampoo bar. This will still clean your hair of dirt and grime, but does not strip your hair of natural oils. It also won't leave any deposit of chemicals that might make your hair soft at first, but ultimately damage it. And like some other comments said, brush it when it's wet, not dry, esp in the shower when you're conditioning!"
