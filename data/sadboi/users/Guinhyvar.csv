With my eldest, nothing, and I mean absolutely NOTHING, worked. She just cried non-stop until she fell asleep and then she'd wake up and cry some more. For months. And it sucked.

With my second, I tried swaddling. And that was the only thing that calmed her. So I swaddled that baby tight.  No idea why, but I wasn't questioning it, I was too busy practicing my swaddling skills. I had that baby wrapped like a burrito 24/7 once I figured out she stopped the ear piercing shrieking once she was swaddled.

My suggestion is that you notify him that in a certain amount of time (week, two weeks, a month) he will need to make alternate living arrangements. What he does in that time frame is entirely up to him. If he chooses to do nothing, that is not your fault. You‚Äôll have to be firm in your resolve. He IS an adult and ultimately is responsible for his own actions.
