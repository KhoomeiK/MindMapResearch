AskReddit,fmnw25g,t3_fweiaf,1586236964.0,"Well my 22nd birthday I saved up 2k USD to go visit my family in Dominican Republic and once it hit my birthday my stepmom found out she was having complications in her uterus or something and blood was filling her belly fast so she thought she was pregnant and ended up not she was in alot of pain, and had to go to the hospital there and my dad didn't have the money for the blood transfusions to save her life, so he ended up borrowing the rest of the money I saved up to go and drive all around the country (I think that's how you say Pais in English) and finally found some and saved her life.

The reason I was salty was because my birthday seems to never matter so I thought being there I would atleast have people wishing me happy birthday instead I ended up saving a life and didnt so much as get a thank your or happy birthday. 

The other reason is because I am her stepkid my mom's enemy who took her man that according to her she didn't want but gets totally jelly when they get near eathother. Plus my dad kinda ignored me and started a new family cause of how I was born, where I was born, and because he never expected my mom to have me or keep me with all my problems. So my stepmom hated me for no reason other than being my mom's kid, she made up lies got me introuble plenty of times and one time almost gave my dad a heart attack cause he thought I got kidnapped or murdered cause she didn't tell him or (conviniently forgot) that I told her I was going to spend some time visiting my mom's childhood neighborhood for a week. And she was the only one i could tell last minute and I didnt have a phone so I figured she wouldn't keep such important information to herself for a whole week. I came back and my dead threatened to beat me up and then called me a liar when I said I told her. I was branded a liar by her ever since I was little. I don't speak to my dad not because of her I just have abandonment issues and so if no one talks to me I don't go looking for them because I don't want to be dissapointed anymore than I already am of my shit life. 

Oh and so many more of my birthdays were disasters. That's just the most fucked in my opinion.
