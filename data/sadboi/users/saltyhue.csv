loseit,fk8gv7h,t1_fk8fcd7,1583955789.0,"I'm feeling this lately. I rarely, if ever, got male attention before my weight loss. Now, anytime I'm out in public I'm getting talked to. I'm also having men going out of their way at professional networking events to come up to talk to me 6+ times. I'm trying to not take it entirely negative and also take it as it comes ... but at the same time it's something I've never dealt with before and I have no idea HOW to deal with it yet?"

NarcissisticAbuse,f4887pj,t1_f44hp6t,1571434080.0,"Thank you for sharing all of this vulnerability. I want you to know for me, its unbelievably validating and bittersweet to have this shared experience.

I've had so many conversations with my therapist about how it feels like I have PTSD. We even went through the DSM5 together and to me, (maybe not my therapist) I related to nearly all of the criteria.

It truly changed fundamentally how I view, interact with and trust the world (and my current relationship). For me, that is something so intense it deserves to be supported and acknowledged because without that, how can we heal?

Thank you so much for your advice, I think I'm going to repeat to myself next weekend something like ""He's a stranger. He always was and always will be. He is the type of guy who somehow made me feel guilty for wanting to see him after a severe car accident that left me permanently injured. He is NOT a good person.""

If you ever want to chat more about this, or just shoot the shit, my messages are open. Talking about it has always helped me."
