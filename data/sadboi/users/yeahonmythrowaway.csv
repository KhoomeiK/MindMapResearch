SuicideWatch,fithm28,t1_fitemd0,1582720315.0,I’ve been flirting with the idea of moving to a new city or even country to give myself a bit of a refresh. I don’t think it’ll take me very far though since I am terrible at socialising and am a very unlikeable person. It would be amazing to get a change of scenery and culture but my inability to make new connections would probably amplify my depression.
depression,fi4e3tu,t3_f6flmx,1582139337.0,"I don’t think I’ve ever had a dream that I would consider good. It’s kinda rare for me to remember a dream thoroughly when I wake up, but when I do they typically fall into one of three categories.

The most common dream I have has me in a situation that induces a lot of anxiety. For whatever reason, they usually consist of me forgetting to do something important right before I’m about to travel somewhere on a plane (which is weird because I barely travel even though I want to) and panicking about it when I realise it’s too late to do anything about it. 

Another type of dream I have sort of common is one where I’m in a position where everybody is ashamed of me and hates me because of some heinous act I’ve done (that is never explained or told in these dreams). There’s even times where I’ve done something (yet again, I never know what I’ve actually done) so bad that I have to go into hiding from everyone I know and even the law.

The least common of the three types of dream I have is where I’ve finally found love or somebody is showing genuine romantic interest in me. It sucks having to wake up to remember that I’m alone and will be forever.

So I’m either having anxiety ridden dreams or ones that cause depression because of how much better they are than my actual life. Despite  what I’ve said, I’d rather live in a dream state forever than have no dreams at all. At least life would be slightly more interesting then."

malehairadvice,fgfvezy,t1_fgfurja,1580748464.0,Preferably similar to what it is in the pic but I’m flexible. I would grow it out more but I’ve thinned out and receded quite a bit so that probably isn’t a good idea
SuicideWatch,fdejeug,t1_fdehzy0,1578340295.0,Do you mind if I ask if either of your attempts did harm to your physical health?
SuicideWatch,fdeisuh,t1_fdeae7h,1578339926.0,"I feel like I’m decently creative, more so than I am analytical or anything like that. I’m not creative enough tho to make it into a career, especially considering how cutthroat getting a career as say, a painter when there’s a ton of painters who are already crazy talented (I’m not into painting btw, just an example). I also have the issue of being pretty skill-less. I’m okay at a few things but not good nor am I capable of getting much better.

Hope you’re doing well and best of luck with becoming an author!"
SuicideWatch,faanhlg,t1_faa5brn,1575911110.0,"Thanks for the advice. Recently I’ve been trying to live in the moment more as a way to avoid overthinking the future but I come across a few hurdles that interrupts me from doing so. The biggest being how horrible I am at forming connections with people or even interacting with them at a basic level. It really triggers my depression and suicidal ideation whenever I’m trying to chat with someone and it doesn’t go too well (which is most of the time). As irrational and completely unreasonable as it sounds, it feels like people just hate me before first impression and that I’m an inherently unlikable person"
SuicideWatch,faa4j8n,t1_faa4c1h,1575901991.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I know it might be a little ironic but if you want to talk about to please do
SuicideWatch,faa4dro,t1_faa3rjo,1575901875.0,"A lot. Lack of ambition, unclear career prospects, emotionally unavailable, absolute inability to make friends, no chance of starting a romantic relationship with anybody, possible gender dysphoria and no skills or talents among other things. These things get more painful to deal with and lose the chance of fixing them with age. I feel like I shouldn't complain considering I grew up and currently live in a conflict-free, developed country into a good family that provided me with a house and food for all these years."
SuicideWatch,faa3br7,t1_faa1wn2,1575901052.0,Thanks for the consideration but every time I’ve tried to talk to someone about this I get no where so I don’t wanna waste your time.
egg_irl,exfirif,t3_cseoce,1566241461.0,"I was doing a survey a couple of months ago and I hesitated when it asked for my gender at the end, even though I’m a cis™️  male. It’s nothing, right?"
egg_irl,evw3xlw,t3_clg8c8,1564854507.0,That feel when you got a receding hairline and can’t grow your hair out without looking like more of a man
