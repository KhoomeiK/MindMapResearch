cults,fpxx2i5,t1_fojams8,1588991347.0,"Generally there is a very big difference between white nationalism and black nationalism, Zionism, etc. as white nationalism has typically manifested itself as great nation nationalism whereby the dominant ethnic group would, if the ideology were so enforced, not only advocates but has the power to oppress, expel, exterminate less powerful groups. Historically we have seen the grim results of this sort of ideology in practice when it has such an opportunity. If there are exceptions to the rule then they are just that. This is aside from explicit differences in ideology between many black nationalists that mainly sought black self-rule or self-determination within the United States. Or Zionism (generally) where the goal was achieving a Jewish state in the former British Mandate of Palestine, which compared to the aspirations of many white nationalists, pales in comparison.

You do have a fair point though, so I do not want to come off as if I am dismissing what you are saying outright. I actually have studied black nationalism quite a bit as well as the history of Zionism and the Palestinian liberation struggle. Certainly there are very nasty variants of each. Within black nationalism you have groups like the Nation of Islam that are utterly racist and antisemitic. They have a bizarre black supremacist explanation for the genealogy of the races - especially warped are their beliefs about whites and Jews. Oddly (or perhaps not?) the one group of white people that they did seem to like was the American Nazi Party. You might be interested to know, in case you did not already, that they invited George Lincoln Rockwell - leader of the American Nazi Party - to speak at at least one of their rallies. He was introduced to roaring applause by none other than Malcolm X. Rockwell and the NOI leadership got along quite well. In any case, yes, there is much to be condemned about groups like the NOI and black supremacists. And a ton of people give them a pass, which might inform your frustration, I am not sure. I was in far-left circles for many years and I saw that repeatedly. Ridiculous.

This is a very different sort of black nationalism than that of, say, the Black Panthers, who disavowed racism - and even criticized anti-white bias amongst other black nationalists - and who formed a ""Rainbow Coalition"" with the Young Patriots (Appalachian whites) and the Young Lords (Puerto Rican). A meeting co-sponsored by the Black Panthers and the Young Patriots:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPTwDO0sh-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPTwDO0sh-E)

Whether you agree or disagree with the ideology here (most do not, understandably), it is a stark difference. I have not seen much in the way of this when it comes to white nationalism, however. It doesn't have to do with any particular race, such as white people and thus their nationalism being worse. More so the historical circumstances giving rise to these movements."

What would Randy Weaver have to do to ""act on his urges"" of being a racist? Does he have to curb stomp black people or something? Come on...

Ruby Ridge is a lightning rod for white nationalists, Neo-Nazis, Christian Identitarians and violent right-wing militias. Has Randy Weaver come out and disavowed his beliefs? Has he done anything to say, hey, what the government did to my family and me was wrong, and there is something to that, but don't make me a martyr in the name of white nationalism?

I do believe in redemption but I don't know if he has taken any steps towards that.

However, most countries signed on to a treaty banning the use of hollow point/soft point ammunition (correct me if I am wrong, but the US was not a party to that though). In warfare generally the ammunition used is FMJ.

The whole thing about the gas is still a pretty good example of the federal government's culpability in this. Koresh did not have his own timeline for setting the compound ablaze. Negotiators were trying to talk him into surrendering, and Koresh appeared open to the idea of doing that if he were allowed to broadcast his ""message,"" which was found as an incomplete draft following the final assault on the compound. 

Instead, the government was just like, nah, we don't want this to go on any longer - they thought 2 months was long enough and they had to ""take action"" and force its conclusion lest they appear ineffective or something along those lines. The gas was not right though. Basically sent a lot of the congregants into one part of the compound to burn to death and did not drive anyone out."

That being said, of course, Koresh was absolutely responsible for how it ended as were the adults there who went along with it. The kids did not really have a choice, but Koresh did not force anyone to stay. They could have left with their children at any time. Koresh would have allowed it; he was no Jim Jones in that regard.

lonely,fnrow6q,t3_g3djxb,1587196147.0,"I felt this way about a lot of people who acted as if they were my friends or that they even loved me. I had a bad habit of giving people the benefit of the doubt, or just wanting to be around them because I had no easy way of socializing with others. I had a lot of other bad habits though, and I cannot say that I was not to blame for meaningless friendships and relationships with others. 

Generally, in most cases, I did not reach out to people to maintain friendships. Not real friendships in any case, where you have mostly positive memories with someone and the two of you are mutually supportive. It was always people to drink and do drugs with or friends with benefits or someone whom I believed I could go through in order to obtain those things. I never really thought about how there could be a cost to what I was doing, and now I put myself in vulnerable situations where it could lead to something bad. 

What is more is that I had problems with excessive mood swings, and looking back I never had much of a sense of purpose or direction. Only now in middle age do I feel as if I have come down to earth. Additionally, I can see that I have been a dozen different people, opening and closing chapters in my life, with the cast of characters always changing.  Now that cast is very minimal. 

After I cleaned-up and got my life back together, got on mood stabilizers and taking myself seriously, I did a lot to isolate myself from most people I knew that I once considered friends. I got off social media and stopped trying to hit people up to drink or do drugs. I stopped providing people with those things too. I stopped hooking up with female friends for sex or impulsively pursuing it with new partners because I realized that I did not need to get validation from that just as I did not need validation from others laughing at my jokes or listening to me go on about whatever nonsense I was saying that made me think I was intelligent. Lo and behold, they all stopped reaching out to me. We were using each other as a means to an end. We weren't truly friends. 

Now I hardly talk to anyone, and I do feel lonely. Perhaps that will change one day, and I do hope it changes, but I do not want it to change by going back to the way things were. It might take me a couple more years to get to that point, but that is fine."

Like totally (or almost totally) turn their lives around. A big part of that being able to make positive changes in the lives of other people going through what they went through - by advocacy or peer mentoring or being AA sponsors something. It demonstrates competency on your part to be able to help others.

What they all did was get degrees and then go work in some capacity for criminal justice reform non-profits that do not care about ones criminal record as much.

I'm not an SO, but I work for a union and sometimes my job involves negotiating contract resignations for people who are under investigation for sex crimes. I joined this subreddit because I wanted to learn about the experiences of RSOs throughout the entire process of arrest, prosecution, and conviction as well as the ongoing consequences they must endure from being placed on the registry. 

I don't think the laws are fair at all. You did something wrong when you were 17 years old that did not require any prison time and you are still paying for it, and from the sound of it you might be paying for it for the rest of your life. Correct me if I am wrong, but the law says that if you fail to register if you move or some shit that you get charged with a felony and your time on the registry is reset? That is insane. And wtf does domestic violence have to do with being an SO?  Why should that extend your time on the registry instead of being treated as a separate crime with its own consequences? Certainly, these laws were a response to serious crimes, but they were a hysterical response nonetheless.

A lot of people think these laws are unfair, but we can't speak to your experiences at all. SOs are some of the most stigmatized people I can think of, and obviously that is getting to you and you are doing some self-stigmatizing that is leading you to shit all over yourself and your prospects when others here are telling you otherwise. That's not uncommon, really, for a lot of people faced with serious stigma. 

Anyway, to wrap this long ass comment up... Perhaps there is the value of writing, publishing, speaking out whether it has monetary value or not. Take this subreddit for instance. You see how beneficial and rehabilitating this is for people? They have a place to vent and get support, advice and feedback. All these moderators had to do was start something on reddit. You asked somewhere else if there was anything you could do to help other people in the same boat. Maybe a blog, a podcast, a forum, I don't know. You'd certainly have a niche market for it.

The American idea of strong rights for individual gun ownership is a beautiful thing, I believe. You do not see it in most European countries. To get a bit more historical, let's consider our English legal heritage. They had this feudal class hierarchy that allowed knights and nobility to bear arms but did not extend that right to the common folk. When the American Republic was founded, the Founders called bullshit on that. Every free man could have that right, which is one reason why I find the opinion of some of my liberal friends - that the Second Amendment does not grant individual gun ownership rights but instead limits it to the National Guard and shit like that - so nauseating. 

Emphasis on ""free man"" of course. We did have the whole fucked up slavery system and what came after it. Of course those millions of people had hardly any fucking rights at all. It was chattel slavery. I was just making a point about the cultural and legal inheritance we have regarding guns that is still valuable."

domesticviolence,fhgjbj6,t1_fhga0ol,1581568698.0,"Anytime. Yeah, saying ""they will never believe you"" is all about instilling fear and and it is really common in situations like yours. I've experienced it before and I know how terrifying it is. I was in a really bad place at the time with substance abuse and psychological issues. Looking back now I feel like I was brainwashed to accept her abuse and do anything to please her. If she thought I liked another girl, she would hold a knife up to me and tell me that she would kill me if I ever left her. If I was out late with my friends and I did not answer her calls because I was not paying attention, when I got home she would bite me, hit me, destroy things that were sentimental to me, throw glass bottles straight at my head, scream at me and insult me. 

She would also try to threaten me with arrest or public humiliation. She even called the police and lied to them once because she went through my phone and saw texts from an ex-girlfriend (I was not ""allowed"" to speak to any exes). Said I attacked her.  I did not touch her. My kid was little at the time and saw everything. Told the police. Despite that, despite what I said to them about how she treated me, when they showed up they called me a drunk and laughed at me when I said I wanted to press charges on her. They just told her to leave and come back the next day, which is what she did. I feel so ashamed of myself for letting her do all that and more to me. 

I feel bad for women in situations like that because they often are. But so are a lot of men and the police can be very dismissive about it or even arrest you. What feels even worse to me is that when I would tell people who supposedly cared about me they would brush it off. Female friends would be like ""oh well I get mad at my boyfriend sometimes too"" and both male and female relatives would act like her physical violence was a big joke even when they saw my injuries. It makes me really appreciate the ones who were concerned.  

One more thing I forgot to recommend - put a recorder on your phone and try as hard as you can to be calm when speaking to her because it is obvious that she speaks to you terribly. Good luck, man."

cults,ffvk1zl,t1_ffv9gtf,1580265955.0,"800 people following him on Facebook doesn't mean anything. I've made pages with 800 followers in no time. The idea that you can take that and throw out some number (100, 150, 200, 300, 500) of real life people that he can certainly amass in your town and take it over is pretty alarmist and absurd.

If he has kids that are making threats then they need some kind of intervention like you would do with any teenager. Who made the threats and how many of them anyway? What was the outcome of the school's investigation? What's with calling his other kids shits? What did they do? Should I be worried about you fucking with them given the way you are talking? What do you even mean ""stockpiled guns?"" I'm from Texas - really curious.

There are weird little cults all over the place. Live in any big city or metropolitan area. We have cults and cult-like groups left and right. We have kids threatening to shoot up schools left and right. 

This guy is a joke. His 800 followers on Facebook are hardly the seeds of the next Rajneeshpuram. Look, I don't like cults either. But I also don't like people freaking out because some weirdos move into their community and then start trying to mess with them. And I don't like heavy-handed responses to groups like this.

Says it originated in Mt. Vernon, Illinois. 

## 5. “Black Annie”

*Mount Vernon, Illinois*

Between the late 1860s and the early 1930s, Mount Vernon was plagued by the appearance of a female spirit known variously as “Black Annie,” “Lady of Sorrow,” or “Cyclone Annie.” According to Michael Norman, sightings of Annie began when the citizens of Mount Vernon ran off a witch who was threatening their cattle. They thought they were rid of her, until February 9, 1888 when a tornado touched down in Mount Vernon and destroyed a half-mile wide swath of homes and businesses, killing 37 and injuring as many as 800 people. After the disaster, several eyewitnesses reported seeing a woman dressed in black—wailing and screaming—wandering among the debris. In 1918, residents of Mt. Vernon were terrified by the appearance of a woman dressed in black who chased pedestrians. Finally, “Black Annie” was blamed for a series of strange attacks in 1936 involving sleeping powder thrown through open windows. She has not been seen since, but parents sometimes use “Black Annie” to scare their children into behaving properly."

Israel,feov0e6,t1_feczai8,1579306009.0,"lol the funny thing is that some of these online far-left groups have their own dorky online communities; and, they manifest themselves in the real world. So it is kinda like they are LARPing because they act, dress, and talk like caricatures. Yeah, most of those people are real leftists and they are really anti-Semitic."
Israel,feoupwb,t1_feou09b,1579305852.0,"Which, by the way, was another deeply held belief shared among members of the far-left, anti-Zionist types I associated with. I am sure everyone here has seen that before. But it is really just so absurd these things they believe. They get angry if you say Israel has a right to self-defense. They do not believe Israelis have such a right. So I guess they are just supposed to stand there and let themselves be killed?"
Israel,feou09b,t1_feejsy7,1579305488.0,"I do not entirely agree with this analogy because the Holocaust was just so horrific. In such cases, when the moral order has been absolutely overturned, I think it is appropriate to not only kill the leadership of such atrocities but anyone who is actively supporting them. They could have a million good points to make. Would not matter.

However, I agree with the thrust of what you are saying. Simply because the Palestinians have legitimate grievances does not negate Israel's right to self-defense nor the right of the Jewish people to self-determination."
Israel,fed00zx,t1_fecyeq3,1578991890.0,"Oh yeah absolutely. They totally overlook stuff like that and do not care about it even when it is brought to their attention. Like it goes over their heads or they just figure that the brown people will sort it out or something. Too complicated. No ""white"" people to call the bad guy imperialist colonizer, etc. 

Yet the Jews ""ethnically cleansed"" Palestine. I mean give me a break. I understand, what happened was bad, as wars are generally bad, especially wars of that nature, but the Israeli War of Independence, the Naqba, whatever one wants to call it... if that was an ethnic cleansing it was the nicest ethnic cleansing in all of history. And yes I am aware that there were atrocities. But an organized ethnic cleansing? I mean we CAN however look to regimes or leaders that they see as ANTI-IMPERIALIST GODS for that shit."
Israel,feczbd6,t1_fecvzwq,1578990933.0,"Since much of the criticism I see comes from the BDS movement, I would say that I do not think that the majority of the criticism is deserved. BDS, or at least what it is promoting, has become more acceptable but at its core it is something of a cult and pretty deranged. I do not think that the majority of people who consider it as a tactic have really thought through its anti-Semitic nature and I did not while I was supporting it. I stopped supporting it even when I still was on the far-left though because of its weirdness. It will try to sell a certain package to certain groups to make them believe it is all about, say, boycotting stuff from the Occupied Territories or settlements but that always turns out to be a hook. Its leadership is completely dishonest. Sometimes you go to this shit and they will start speaking out favorably about Hamas and rocket attacks on Israel or Jewish politicians like Bernie Sanders because, I don't know, he is a Jew and while he is critical of Israel and - I think unfortunately - has been chummy with certain BDS types he does not believe that Israel should be driven into the sea and says nice things about it sometimes. So how dare he! 

I have been to meetings and groups that are not just loosely affiliated with the idea of putting pressure on Israel to grant statehood to the Palestinians or ending the Occupation but the organizations that are really running the show. They invariably turn to the idea that Israel is 1) equivalent to South African Apartheid (which is absurd considering the population balance and history) and 2) begin to present demands that cannot be fulfilled without essentially destroying Israel as a Jewish state. This includes the Right of Return to not just Palestinians who lost property in Israel proper like back in 1948-1949 as they are mostly dead now but their children and children's children. Also, that Israeli Arabs are ""second class citizens"" who should be made ""equal"" to Jews in Israel. 

This is an alluring demand to Americans because they see Israeli marriage laws and immigration laws as racist - why restrict by ethnicity (many other countries obviously do this when it comes to immigration, but liberals and leftists hate this in the United States). Ultimately the conversation turns to the idea that any Palestinian wherever he or she is currently living should be able to waltz right into Tel Aviv like he owns the place (because of course he does!) based upon Israeli Arabs truly being Palestinians who could invite relatives from anywhere else to come immigrate to any part of Israel and expand the Arab population there. 

Certainly, I think the condition of the Palestinians is miserable in the West Bank and Gaza. I think they have legitimate grievances and there is something to say about disproportionate responses to their attacks. I do not like the idea of settlements and pretty much dividing the West Bank into a bunch of different cantons. That is not right. However, the Palestinian leadership has been fucking horrible throughout its entire existence. Like the far-left seems to fetishize the Palestinian national liberation movement but even Palestinian historians like Rashid Khalidi and others will say that it has been a complete fucking failure - even what they regard as their ""victories"" have been defeats where they just haven't gotten their asses totally handed to them like they usually do. Or doing totally crazed things like the Second Intifada. You cannot justify terrorism and just kill people with no achievable goal. They aren't going to get anything that way and they are now weaker than ever. You can't just keep saying that Israel deserves all of the blame and much of the criticism of Israel I see is extremist like that."
Israel,fecnov8,t3_eoe74k,1578978500.0,"Oh yeah for sure. I was on the American far-left for many years, since I was 16 years old until 33. So I got to know a lot of people in various anti-war, anti-imperialist movements and what not. One thing that has always stood out to me is how frequently I would come across people who believed and would openly say that Israel did not have a right to exist and, more so, that any Israeli is a legitimate target. 

When pressed on this question, ""How could you say that Israel does not have the right to exist? Look at what America has done - we are protesting the invasion of Iraq (later occupation of Iraq... a country we blew to bits in a war that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people) and you do not say that the United States does not have to right to exist or run around saying 'death to America!'"" Of course, some would say that too lol. But most were just satisfied criticizing American imperialism specifically and maybe if they were some kind of anarchist or communist or revolutionary socialist or some shit they would say that they want all nations to disappear in some far off End Times scenario. It was not something they would say routinely. 

UNTIL you brought up Israel. Then they would say ""But I also think that America does not have the right to exist!"" Yet they would never say this on a regular basis like they would with Israel, a small country and the world's only Jewish state. Sure, suppose you disagree with Israeli policies. Fair enough. Those policies can and have changed. That is up to the Israelis. However, according to their own beliefs, the United States is responsible for so much carnage. Yet they would not dare to say that every American is a legitimate target, that they are legitimate targets, and walk around saying the United States has no right to exist and should be forcibly destroyed the way they would with Israel. 

These views have a decent amount of influence in radical subculture and protest movements yet they are largely seen as weird and marginal - although they have gained much more traction. Still they mainly attract weird and marginal people who are hysterical fanatics. The internet is a more suitable environment for them. And yes, it is anti-Semitic. If you act like a bloodthirsty madman when it comes to ""Jews behaving badly"" as you see it but do not apply the same standard to others then why are you so obsessed with Jews? Isn't that always how anti-Semitism worked? 

I could go further than that: they would say, oh, you cannot silence Black voices, Arab voices, Latinx voices, Muslim voices, Third World voices, whatever. Like if you were just some regular white guy from a Christian background.. they have something to say.. you better ""shut up and listen!"" But Jews? Nah. Fuck 'em. They're just plain ol' white people and Israelis are white European imperialist apartheid genocidal settlers. As I was exiting the far-left and I guess towards social democracy as well as not just believing Israel had a right to exist but having greater sympathy for Israel, I remember questioning a former ""comrade"" about this considering that, what, 40% of the Jewish population of Israel is Mizrahi and the entire birth of Israel, if anyone cared to seriously look at the history, was hardly a ""European colonialist project."" He looked at me all weird, and said something along the lines of how because Israelis ""colonized Palestine like Europeans, they are."" No, the whole thing is crazy. 

Sorry for the rant, I just cannot believe I ran in such circles for so long and bought into a lot of that shit."

bipolar2,fdftj8j,t3_el4c48,1578369835.0,"I was diagnosed a little over a month ago and I am also in my mid 30's. I've mostly been learning as much as I can about it and taking therapy and my medication routines very seriously. My life has improved dramatically in this short amount of time, but I realize that I have a long way to go in learning to live with this and with other problems I have always carried with me. I mean I was functioning and in fact could be fairly successful at times. Then there was always some crash. I just thought my life was chaotic and I got depressed sometimes lol. I did not even realize how messed up I got when I would have hypomanic episodes. I feel so different now that I have been a month on a mood stabilizer and seeing a therapist once a week. Like I am myself. 

I don't tell anyone except people I can trust and mental health providers. I certainly do not tell my employer. I don't think it is a good idea to advertise it unless you are in a position to do so and most of us are not. There is a lot of stigma surrounding bipolar disorder and I don't think it is anyone's business really. Unless they need to know or I think there is a valid reason for them to know then I won't bring it up. 

Actually what you are doing now, going on reddit and posting anonymously, has also been helpful to me. I never used this site before I learned about my diagnosis and I just wanted to find a way to talk about it and read what other people had to say. It has been really eye opening to see that other people have had very similar experiences to my own when it comes to bipolar disorder and some other stuff I have going on. 

Anyway... before I keep blathering... I would say the main thing that has helped me has been learning about what this is exactly and reflecting on my life with this new information in mind."
