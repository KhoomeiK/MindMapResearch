depression_partners,fpe9bbt,t3_gcw8de,1588542942.0,"Empathy fatigue is real and I'd recommend looking into it. Loving someone who has depression can take a lot out of people. Bad past experiences with therapy suck but y'know who can help you work through them? A therapist. If you don't like one, you can tell them that and try another. It's ironic that he's against medication but is self-medicating. With that being said, I get his concern. Some of the medications I've had weren't good fits for me but I communicated with my psychiatrist and we found ended up finding a fit that works. You still feel (with a good fit) but the depression doesn't hit you as hard and for as long. It's manageable. Meds to take a while to get used to, though.

Take care of yourself first. It sounds like it'd suck to have to stop putting as much effort into your significant other, but you can't help them if you're struggling. There's a quote I've heard that says ""fill your cup first and let it overflow to others.""

Tell him how you feel when he says this. You still need to be heard in this relationship even if you think he has it worse. If he died, you'd still be here and you'd still have the same struggles but now you wouldn't have your partner to face them with you. As for the job, if he doesn't like it and you two have free time together, maybe start planning activities to do together. It could be simple like having tea or making dinner or watching a movie, playing a game, stuff like that. But it's purposeful time to show that you care about him and want to spend time with him. Maybe look into a therapist for yourself, too, as they'd have more experience professionally navigating this."

In high school my dad would scold me for staying in my room all day and sort of talk down on me for it, which only made me feel worse so I spent even more time in my room. I realize now that he was doing it out of concern even if his method wasn't the best. My mom tries to encourage me to see my friends (not right now with quarantine) and because she phrases it as a suggestion with a positive tone I respond better to it.

Unfortunately, it can be a really sensitive subject for people. I've had someone tell me that if I needed space that was fine, but they were speaking up because from the outside my actions looked like a bunch of red flags. That helped me put things into perspective. I get where you're coming from with not knowing what's going to be seen as supportive vs invasive. **To answer your question**: yes, people have tried to persuade me to not self-isolate and it's worked sometimes, but not all of the time. Clear communication saying ""I want to support you but I'm still learning how.

I’ve stopped counseling after I ‘felt better’ (which is ridiculous, it’s a chronic condition. I know even if it’s not actively flaring up that the condition is there) and after stopping things would eventually get bad again after a couple of months.

Dating someone who has depression can be really difficult at times, and it’s not on you to be the reason they can get out of bed. My comment’s kind of long caus I wanted to give you an in-depth reply, so feel free to read just chunks that you’re interested in or not!

Quarantine:
Quarantine’s been messing with a lot of us, and it pushed people with depression into an environment that is pretty much what psychologists and related professionals have said exactly to avoid. Right now, support might just be “it DOES suck, and it’s going to need to be around for a while so I want to find ways that I can support you while this is still going on” or “I know it’s not like seeing each other in person, but I can’t do that right now and I want to see your face even if it’s through the screen” because YOU also need to feel supported too.

Therapy:
As for therapy, it’s not a short process and it takes a while to really see the results. Different therapists and different types of therapy work better for some people than others. For me it was Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Meds usually have adjustment periods where they’re still balancing out in your system, and those can feel really weird. Some meds are a good fit for you, others aren’t.

Dealing with med side effects:
Unfortunately it’s hugely on a case by case basis, but I can say that while he might not feel like the same person he might feel more stable and capable of getting through the day. Clear and open communication with the psychiatrist is what makes things go easier during the process of finding the right meds, and it’s also important to note that the meds won’t take away every depressed sensation, but it can make them easier to work with if you have the right fit for you. Overall, good luck to both you and your boyfriend. Quarantine sucks but it’s how we get rid of the virus:)"

If communicating what type of support he prefers is still hard for him, do you think he’d be open to taking the love language quiz online?

SuicideWatch,fpcb3cr,t1_fpc851d,1588493894.0,"Hey this came off as pretty aggressive for this subreddit. Additionally I don’t think it’s wise to tell OP to contact them right now as OP sounds like they’re still working through stuff and the wife and son might still be healing.

(If you want any advice, OP): OP you can’t change what you’ve done but you can recognize it, accept the consequences, and work to not do the same actions that you did before this. You are still worthy of life."

While some of us are trying to change things I don’t know how soon we’ll be able to or how effective we’ll be, but I want you to know I see what our country’s done and I know that it’s inexcusable. The flag’s not really great at all when it stands for what we’ve become."

Agree to disagree, I don’t think it’s really that nice. Not terrible, but kind of disappointing. It absolutely varies state by state and even county by county though."
relationship_advice,fp771ly,t1_fp6vqie,1588365222.0,Your original point had some merit but you chose to phrase it in a needlessly rude way. People are giving you shit for it because you came off as a dick. Habitual cheaters do tend to try to gaslight to cover it up but that point’s being missed because of your phrasing.
Showerthoughts,fp76kk2,t1_fp75rxu,1588364978.0,"Just came off unnecessarily aggressive. You sounded like you were making some assumptions about what she was or wasn’t doing with possible recovery and it seemed unnecessary and came off as condescending.

I respectfully disagree with ‘coddling’ being more damaging than victim blaming as different peoples’ recovery have different paces and can’t be described by any one time period that’s ideal for improvement but I’d rather not debate it based on your tone/phrasing. I didn’t have an issue with your opinion, but the way you worded it seemed needlessly aggressive. Again, have a good day, ok?"

love,fp72feg,t1_fp6mync,1588362815.0,Have you posted this in r/ptsd? They might have a clearer understanding of some of your reactions or why you responded the way you did.
fuckeatingdisorders,fp71l4n,t3_ga434i,1588362384.0,"Have you heard about how lifeguards need to know when to let go of someone so that they don't drown too? I used to hate the concept and thought it was heartless but I get it now. I've had some friends leave in the past because they couldn't be around me while I was suffering and honestly I'm glad they recognized that. I hate to say that someone's using their conditions as an excuse or as manipulation, but some people really do that and it sounds like your friend might be doing that too from what you've written. Honestly, maybe it's time to call her out and say that you can't be there for her anymore.

One of my professors at the university told me about empathy fatigue and said ""Fill your cup first. Allow the overflow to benefit others."" It sounds like your friend's straight up chugging out of your cup and leaving it empty. Fill up your cup, work on keeping it full, and if it spills over to her then great but if it doesn't at least you're still taking care of yourself."
fuckeatingdisorders,fp70dk5,t3_gad0p5,1588361765.0,"Hi! I'm at the waaay beginning of my journey (finally talked to a dietician today and got a referral to an eating disorder specialist for Wednesday) and I really related to the feeling of one binge negating the weekly deficit. For a solid three weeks or so (which I was really proud of even though it's not long) I was logging every food I ate and staying under a calorie total that even the food logging app told me wasn't enough. If I went over budget for that day I felt crushed even though it still wasn't enough calories for my body.

I've had to stop looking at my scale. I thought about it this morning and ultimately didn't step on because I know that whatever the number is, it's going to make me feel disappointed. I'm kind of short for someone my age so my 'recommended' weight is also kind of lower. Knowing I'm not going to be at that means I'm not stepping on the scale again until I'm in control of both my eating habits *and* my feelings about them.

For preventing binging I started buying more 'healthy' foods that I would be less interested in eating a lot of. I don't see myself going to town on a can of carrots or garbanzo beans.

So for me: not stepping on the scale (why bother if it's just going to make me upset), and not buying binge food.

If you're able to, I'd really encourage you to talk to a professional who could give you more solid advice on your specific concerns, but I don't want to pressure you to if you can't or don't feel comfortable doing so."
fuckeatingdisorders,fp6yzk5,t1_fp1p90q,1588361065.0,Some universities also offer mental health/nutrition services on campus/through campus (if things are still online when you start the semester). Worth looking into!
fuckeatingdisorders,fp6xql3,t3_gb2qar,1588360430.0,"Would you be super against showing this post to him? I've heard from people whose significant others have had EDs that they had a hard time understanding what was going through their head sometimes because it's different thought processes than what they're usually considered. Obviously, you'd know way better than I would how he'd react, but it sounds like he loves you and might want to understand it more. Without putting pressure on him to be your main recovery-support person, like you've already mentioned, maybe it could help him understand how he can help you emotionally?"

I literally just got off the phone with a dietician from my doctor's office after talking about my eating tendencies for the first time and the timing of this post couldn't have been better. I don't know you but I'm genuinely happy to read about this chapter of your journey. It helped me feel hopeful about the process that I'm starting and I hope I can write my own progress post someday too. Thank you for writing this out, you're awesome :)"
