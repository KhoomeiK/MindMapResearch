breakingmom,fqlnjve,t3_gjaw0r,1589462369.0,That‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôve never sent good vibes but you got them! Congratulations on everything you‚Äôve accomplished so far! I wish so many more successes! üòòüòò

breakingmom,foy2ald,t3_ga6a8j,1588163542.0,"Well that‚Äôs super fucked! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I‚Äôm mad for you! Keep your head up mama we‚Äôve all been ‚Äúmean mommy‚Äù at some point. I‚Äôm ‚Äúmean mommy‚Äù more often now, but it will get better. Enjoy your space don‚Äôt give it up if you don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôm sure you have to share everything else with your husband and kids so let this be yours. You put in the work and time by yourself and you should be able to enjoy the space how you choose."
breakingmom,fokg03j,t1_fofllo4,1587841371.0,"I‚Äôm sorry this is going on. I wish I had some better advice. I tried this game called ‚Äúthe and‚Äù it‚Äôs a pretty fun relationship, but not overbearing, game."
breakingmom,fokfr8n,t1_foi67i9,1587841243.0,"Nope not what I meant at all. From my understanding of the post she is not sure if her husband is gay & I think she stated she did oral. Pegging is a different not talked about option, typically. It‚Äôs something I tried that brought something to my bedroom at one point so I figured someone else might like it. I don‚Äôt believe anal = gay but anal can equal fun. Just a thought. No harm meant."
breakingmom,fofhbx5,t3_g71em8,1587735896.0,"Please let me know if I‚Äôm out of line, but have you ever tried something called pegging? It could be something to explore. Watch some ‚Äúmovies‚Äù together get an idea of what the both of you like? I know we‚Äôre all busy and stressed so it doesn‚Äôt make it the most optimal time for sex but I think I‚Äôve been in a similar situation, but I was the offending party, and honestly trying new things really helped the both of us out. Good luck! I wish you all the best."
schizoaffective,fnx1o5z,t3_g3bw88,1587329725.0,I wish I looked that pleased when I took my meds. üòú Good job on keeping on track! I‚Äôm proud of you!
schizoaffective,fiaenv8,t3_f256lq,1582299471.0,Yay! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre ok!
schizoaffective,fhbamco,t3_f256lq,1581438325.0,"No really, are you okay?"
schizoaffective,ff062sa,t1_ff02o2n,1579465603.0,Ha! Sorry. Incomplete thought. Listen to my psychiatrist.
schizoaffective,feyxq4l,t3_eqw1xe,1579451727.0,"Take the meds... stay on them. Even if ‚Äúthey‚Äù, the voices, say don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure if or when they stop completely, been diagnosed for 2 years and consistent meds for about a year now, but it gets better-ish. I‚Äôve gone on a mean bender, I‚Äôve done the ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù route too. I mean to say I‚Äôm not an expert but when I finally started listening to mine things eventually started to get a little more manageable."
schizoaffective,fe9ybf8,t3_eo7aid,1578942560.0,"Dry mouth, really thirsty, sleepiness, sometimes a little queasy on an empty stomach. There might be other side effect but these are the only ones I‚Äôve experienced. Drink lots of water."
schizoaffective,fdqrtg5,t3_emdbe5,1578673512.0,Are they just out of the corner of your eye or is it something you can see full on?
breakingmom,fdnw7ax,t3_em4m8v,1578594093.0,Oh momma you are doing fine duck that other person. If your baby likes video games give that baby a video game and give yourself a quick nap. Video games aren‚Äôt bad and they are good for family time too. Keep pushing momma you got this you‚Äôre strong!
schizoaffective,fdnv8tx,t3_emdbe5,1578593534.0,"That sounds scary sorry this is happening to you. Honestly I didn‚Äôt know I was seeing things until someone else wasn‚Äôt seeing them. Of you are having hallucination it‚Äôs good that you know that they are just that. Are you always alone when stuff happens? You should write down when they happen too, so when you bring this up to your parents they have more information."
breakingmom,fcra9yc,t3_eikisw,1577899044.0,"We have a Cane Corso and it‚Äôs a pretty sturdy dog. He fit into our rough and tumble group. The kid is 5 now so a lot better at not being mean to the our pup 4 y/o about to be 5. Over the years they have gotten collectively better with each other but I don‚Äôt think my pup would have been as great for my kid if he didn‚Äôt really know how to navigate the family through trial and error. Personally I like big dogs so that‚Äôs what we have and the breed is known for being a family dog, albeit protective. If you‚Äôre going to a shelter bring your tiny person with you and see how the potential pup and tp react to each other. The dog will mostly be fine with a new baby since you already have one. I don‚Äôt know if I covered all of your questions but if you have anymore I‚Äôll try my best to answer."
schizoaffective,fcnberg,t3_ehs9li,1577808011.0,"I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. Why don‚Äôt you go back? I mean, you know the outcome of you don‚Äôt go now explore the how stuff will turn out for YOU if you do go. I‚Äôm sure your partner will understand and be supportive of you trying to be a better version of yourself. If not then... that‚Äôs up to you what you do in that situation. Your financial situation won‚Äôt change until you get better. Idk maybe I‚Äôm wrong but it might not hurt to try and go back."
schizoaffective,fbr5yhw,t3_edo1wz,1577039555.0,The only things that have changed for me are my sleeping habit and the amount of manic episodes. I did feel ‚Äúmuted‚Äù for the first few weeks but that‚Äôs feeling slowly passed. I started with a low dose and moved up over time.
schizoaffective,fbo1qiu,t3_edo1wz,1577005768.0,You had a question about lithium?
schizoaffective,f8836u2,t3_dzf7gj,1574347741.0,"That happens to me. Well sort of. On my meds I still feel paranoid and at times can see somethings. But off my meds I feel free and clear. But after an extended amount of time I go back on and look at things like my notebooks for class and that shit is a jumble of mess and hardly legible. Off meds is great feeling for a bit, in my opinion, but I think on meds is just the right amount of boring life and excitement."
breakingmom,f7ia1b5,t3_dwci3y,1573755733.0,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this mama. It truly does suck. Have you seen a lactation consultant? Some hospitals provide the service. I had a kiddo with a hard time latching and I took him to the appointment and we found some solutions that worked for the both of us plus took stress off of me. Good luck love!
schizophrenia,f6p4yhy,t3_dscuyl,1573047551.0,"Yay! Congratulations! Hopefully the first thing they try will work for you but if they don‚Äôt, let someone know quickly and keep trying until you find something that works for you. Good luck my friend."
schizophrenia,f6jtyu0,t3_drf85z,1572900180.0,"Keep powering through. I failed my first year back at school ending with a 1.8, I have a 3.0 now. It took time and I definitely had to adjust the amount of classes I‚Äôm taking but once you find that sweet spot it gets better. Not easy, but better. You gotta love the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù teachers though they make life funny. Enjoy college, take smaller course loads, if you can, find a work study if they have them and apply for scholarships that have nothing to do with GPA. Take an art class or creative class."
schizophrenia,f6je1la,t3_drf85z,1572893270.0,"I‚Äôve been in college twice once years before I was diagnosed or showed signs and now I think I‚Äôm about a year into treatment, it sucks either way. You‚Äôll make it, we just have to work a little harder and find at least one person who knows and accepts our ability. Try to find some humor in these situations because in the grand scheme of things this will be a small thing maybe even nothing."
schizophrenia,f6jdk02,t3_drjrb6,1572893050.0,Happy belated-birthday!!! I know we don‚Äôt know each other but it can get better. A fuck ton of days suck but a lot of them can be bearable and even really good! What would you like to do if University isn‚Äôt for you? Talk to your parents about alternatives for work. You‚Äôre not out of the game yet. If you aren‚Äôt officially diagnosed then maybe you can still get a job where you could afford the meds?
schizophrenia,f6jbp34,t3_drf85z,1572892220.0,It was their decision to take your advice. Good on you for trying to help but you have to take care of yourself. I don‚Äôt know what year you are in school but this shit is hard. Focus on overcoming that. If you have wisdom to impart on your friends that‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs up to b the top male the best decision for themselves. Sorry if I‚Äôm rambling. I completely feel for you. Cry about it for a bit and move on. They‚Äôll be fine and so will you.
schizophrenia,f6jandl,t3_drj4gd,1572891756.0,"Yes, been there. Apparently I still go to class but take unintelligible notes. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called but it happens when I don‚Äôt take my meds for some amount of time. Sorry this happened to b you but you‚Äôre not alone."
schizophrenia,euv91d4,t3_chmdtv,1564057259.0,"Our situations kind of parallel each other. You can make it though, if you want to continue school talk to the accessibilities office on campus, they should have tools that will help you, it‚Äôs a service you already pay for so you might as well give it a try. Did you try for a work-study on campus? They typically don‚Äôt pay much but it‚Äôs a little extra money. Your gf seems wonderful and just ass the poster before me said, lean on her for support. It‚Äôs hard out here take support where you can get it. I hope this helps. Good luck!"
schizophrenia,eu2mq8k,t1_eu2lxq8,1563393525.0,"What do/did you find fun? What makes you a little bit happy, that you can do for yourself? Getting out of a funk is hard, trust me I know, but typically good people gravitate to good things (i.e. good people). I‚Äôm 30 now and I found someone after a divorce & skipping to a whole new country for a few years then coming back. It‚Äôs possible."
schizophrenia,eu2kurx,t3_ceg4os,1563392374.0,"I think it might happen, well I hope it will happen. Do you know what you are looking for? Do you have your shit straight? I‚Äôm sure there is someone out there willing to experience life/ survive with you. I know it‚Äôs rough out there but your person is out there."
schizophrenia,eu2jpwi,t3_cecled,1563391654.0,Yay!! Congrats on your birthday! I wish you many more!
breakingmom,etzg6ow,t3_ce5lf8,1563331355.0,"Yay you!! You‚Äôve done what most SAHM wish they could, have a solid moment of being (insert your name here) instead of ‚Äúmom‚Äù, ‚Äúmommy‚Äù, ‚Äúmama‚Äù or any other variation of the title. Good on you, enjoy your summer. This is a win for you! I‚Äôm proud of you."
schizophrenia,etz6xe5,t3_ce1qqj,1563327747.0,"Change in behavior can mean a lot of different things, stress can trigger change in behavior. If you feel you have a legitimate medical concern you should go see a professional. I‚Äôm sorry you are so worried. I hope you get it all straightened out."
breakingmom,eq147na,t3_bwt7fq,1559700745.0,I felt like this before. Have you tried joining a gym with a childcare center? You might meet some interesting people and if nothing else you can be in a room with other adults and not think about home for a bit. Drag your husband along if he has time. My partner and I do it and it has really helped us get some ‚Äúalone-ish‚Äù time away from the tiny person.
