I know Physicians are at an all-time high but what about EMS, nursing, laboratory work? I know you're in a third-world country at the moment but you're still young, and frankly, you have a helluva' lot more credentials than me at 25.  Depression is a tough s.o.b to battle, especially if you're on your own or others in your country don't ""believe"" in mental illnesses. The best way to fight it, at least in my own experience, is to come up with a ""game plan."" Doing whatever to overcome financial, health, mental, social hardships. Focus on just one problem and brainstorm on solutions. You're a smart man, you've come a long way of studying medicine; don't give it all up, there are people who are proud of you, and believe you will get through this."

I have no support from anyone. None of my friends hanged out with me this summer, my family wouldn't break a tear if I killed myself. I've bought some rope and tied a hangman's noose. It's just a matter of time for me.  I've made it so obvious that I was going through stuff. This entire year has been a shit show for me.  The only thing I would recommend is if you get a support group. I feel like that would help the both of us. So if you can get professional help, have insurance, I hope you get the help. I'm suppose to go back this week. If you need someone to talk to you can message me."
