speedrun,fr63dhx,t1_fr5r4y6,1589919210.0,"Yeah, it definitely needs to be case-by-case. The thing about resetting in pokemon, for example, is that that starter is gonna have a huge impact on the run. Sploosh Kaboom is one minigame that is entirely RNG that has little to no bearing on the rest of the game. The most important thing IMO is fun. Speedrunning is a hobby, and I assume (I hope) most runners are doing it because they enjoy it. I don't think anybody enjoys Sploosh Kaboom :P Especially since, as you mentioned, Wind Waker is mechanically intense and the run focuses a lot on precise inputs for movement.

I also think the definition of 'a tool that assists a run' can be really subjective, in the same way that defining a glitch can be subjective. ([This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yhi5x4DzkY) on that topic is super interesting.) I think that subjective definition can be stretched a little based on what each community values in their runs."

I had Celeste say that she thought the sky would be clear and good for viewing stars, so that's how I knew. Over the course of about 3 hours I wished on over 200 stars, and I was multitasking so I missed some. If your camera is tilted towards the sky and you don't see any over like 20 minutes, there might not be a meteor shower that night."
