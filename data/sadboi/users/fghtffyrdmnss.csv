Breakwater’s, I’ve seen mixed reviews but I’ve had good effects with their lozenges. Sure, mints are not fun to eat like gummies or chocolate or cookies, but they help my anxiety/depression/adhd in daytime. And the nighttime ones help me actually stay asleep through the night, after a hit of blueberry 32 gets my ruminating mind to shut the fuck up.

Everyone’s different though. I know some patients haven’t had as much help with them as I have. Breakwater is the only ATC I can comment on, but I know other dispensaries (Curaleaf being one) have lozenges as well.

While I do fear resentment from my SO but she could be a carrier, as you said, diabetics are among the highest risk underlying conditions.

I was trying to think of compromise but decided not to. SO is struggling, especially the uncertainty of how long this will last but... SD lives with her grandpa, who is still going to work. BM and her bf also live there AND on top of all that, SD half sister has gone to her fathers in the next state over. I don’t know how cautious they’re being, if they wipe down their groceries, if they’ve gone out nonchalantly. There are too many variables out of my control and regardless of any of that, **it’s not worth putting my health at risk.**

IMO: I don’t think she should be going near anyone besides who is in the primary residence she’s been sheltering in place at. It sucks. A LOT. And SO fears she’s going to think he doesn’t want to see her but, this is not just any other weekend... ultimately I think they will grow to understand.

stepparents,fm2wrun,t3_fnu6bc,1585707232.0,"We have SD11 every weekend. My SO has a good relationship with BM and BG (SD lives with her grandpa as well). Very flexible, which is all great.

I’m in NJ, right next to like the biggest hotspot in the country. Two weekends ago when this Coronavirus started reallyyy blowing up in the US, she stayed home. There was no word of it for this past weekend until the Friday before, SO says that he’s going to pick her up Saturday afternoon.

Background: I‘m extra high risk being diabetic (one of the top underlying conditions in death cases) and have another autoimmune disease as well, so my immune system is pretty compromised. My SO also has a condition that makes his weaker.) I’m a huge neurotic germaphobe every single day of my life, so, needless to say I have a TON of anxiety over all of this. I haven’t left my house in 3 weeks. Only to go to pharmacy drive through for my prescriptions (with Purell wipes and gloves on deck) and for walks.

I asked if he really thought that was a good idea. Her grandfather still needs to go in to work. My SO is still working as well so it’s not really good for either side. Especially when they’re okay keeping her there...

He says “no you’re right”, but then to say why he doesn’t think she should come here, he made up a story about how someone at his job might have it and is waiting to get tested. Instead of just stating the facts with everything that’s going on. I can tell that it’s bothering him, he misses her of course and I can tell he feels like he should “give them a break”, so to speak. But the way I look at it is: the fact that someone from each household is still going to work every day is a big component and a risk for everyone.

I’m nervous to ask about this weekend. I will feel so much more comfortable if it was until this all blew over. I would be a paranoid, nervous wreck all weekend and would quarantine myself in our bedroom. But then she could still spread it to him. I hate this so much."
