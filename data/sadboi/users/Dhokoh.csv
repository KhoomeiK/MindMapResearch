Our chats are usually one worded so I don't expect much from her in that regard. Like I said what motivates me to keep going are the good memories of when we're together. The distance fucking sucks as her replies are like one or two words and me, I'm not much of a chatter when texting so whenever I see a ""okay"" and stuff, I just leave that read and don't reply. Sometimes she'd send me memes and stuff but it's not continuous (not that I demand any of that) but her ""okay"", ""yes"", ""nope"" answers kind of empowers the ""she doesn't give a flying fuck about us"" feeling I get.

But like I said I won't risk my stay or get into any legal problems over something as small as weed. I was in Taiwan where weed is also illegal, even more severely restricted than in Poland because not even medical weed is legal, so I didn't smoke. I didn't die. I just thought that being Poland  a Western country, weed regulations would be more flexible (which they are), however, the scope of my question was more towards the cultural perspective, and just by saying that people would call the cops on you even if you're smoking at home just makes it bad enough to not be willing to smoke."

LongDistance,fln5did,t1_flm6hau,1585309649.0,"Well, I kind of understand your position, I'm in a LDR myself, and as I'm an overthinker and insecure person, I have the same ""creating scenarios"" thing going in my head, but what I do is, whenever I have those thoughts I remember how awesome things are when we close the distance. I rather to think on that, on the smiles we share and all the love she gives me when we're together so this way, I don't let the thoughts and insecurity to affect my relationship. 

Now, I understand my SO has stuff to do, she's busy, she studies, and I gotta respect and understand that. So with that in mind, and the memories of our days together (I managed to close the distance for three months where I lived with her in her country) I am moving forward to close it again for good.

So, basically, my advice is: it doesn't matter why are you having those thoughts, or even that you had a bad situation triggering them, you can't chain yourself to that, so instead of focusing on the bad, focus on the good, on the love, on the happiness, and take your strenght from it. Also, understand he's busy and also has a life to live on his own and do not let the insecurity take over you, also, understand it's YOUR behaviour and therefore only YOU can beat it. I won't tell you anything about self love (although that's an even better advice) because in my case, I'm just insecure and an overthinker so I've had always had those scenarios, but they're specially strong now that I'm in an LDR (my first one)."
