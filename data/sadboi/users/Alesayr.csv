""**SpaceX said it has “qualified our engines to be robust to turbine wheel cracks. However, we are modifying the design to avoid them altogether,” said spokesman John Taylor.**

Qualified to be robust to turbine wheel cracks = we can fly with cracked turbines without affecting mission success.

Modifying the design to avoid them altogether = trying to fix the problem so they don't HAVE to fly with cracked turbines.

WayOfTheBern,fnj1wsq,t1_fniyo1v,1586990424.0,"It's always hard to explain the intricacies of your job, but my work is basically getting non progressive politicians to sign up to ambitious climate policy, and improving mediocre or average climate policy into very good climate policy. Biden's plan has the key elements needed to become a very good plan, it just needs some work. The framework is already good. It commits to net zero by 2050. It agrees to a carbon price. It agrees to end fossil fuel subsidies. Government energy use is important, but it's dwarfed by the private sector. For effective results the most important focus point is reducing corporate emissions (of which 65-75% is electricity usage) which this plan does well at. 


I understand where you're coming from but honestly while the emissions sources you're talking about are large, they're a fraction of US total emissions. Like lets take the Pentagon. 59m metric tons  of co2 equivalent produced in 2017 (most recent data i could find). More than Portugal. Sounds huge. Until you realise how much the US produced as a whole...

6.5bn metric tons... Pentagon emissions are less than 1% of the US total... still important.  Still need to cut them down. But not the headline part of the problem. The fact that it hasn't been comprehensively worked out  yet isn't worrying to me. Much more focused on the 65% of emissions the corporates are releasing. Of course DoD is severely probbo in other non climate ways. 


Mostly Biden's plan  just needs some tightening (eg: great we will be at net zero by 2050, will that be achieved through heavy lifting upfront and a strong 2030 target of 67% or will it be more of a 50% by 2030 deal? 

The one big weakness is the lack of a fracking ban, but sadly that's purely a political consideration. We can't really talk about that until post election. Dems are afraid a fracking ban will lose them the swing states they need so it won't be up for debate until after trump is defeated. But everything else is workable. I spend all day turning plans far worse than Biden's into something that is in line with how ambitious we need to be. I would strongly disagree with the argument that Biden and Trump will have similar climate impacts. We can do that with a Biden plan. We can't do it with a trump plan, because trump is actively trying to tear down any climate plans anyone makes"

Forgive me, because this sounds like strawmanning even to me. But as best i can tell your argument seems to be...

 ""Biden's lying about saying he'll do something, he'll do nothing. And doing nothing is worse than the incumbent actively trying to reverse progress. But the world's fucked anyway so there is no point in doing anything.""

And that makes no sense to me whatsoever. 


Could you please clarify? Because either I'm totally misunderstanding you or there's no logic in that at all"
