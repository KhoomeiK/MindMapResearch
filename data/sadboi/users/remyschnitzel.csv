Anxiety,fm8t6er,t3_ftrthm,1585855556.0,"1. If I can distract myself from whatever I'm feeling I know it's anxiety.  Even if the distraction is just someone talking to me, if I can give them my full focus it's anxiety.  

2. Symptoms have definitely evolved over time!  Used to be a fear of puking in public, now it's a fear of a heart attack (I am 31 so the fear isn't rational).

3. I'll seek medical help if I'm unable to distract myself from the problem of if a trusted loved one agrees it's the right thing to do.  I no longer google symptoms, in the past I could convince myself I had anything and ultimately it just made the anxiety worse.  Now, if something is really bothering me, I'll ask my fiancee to look something up for me.  

4. Best advice for any health anxiety related thing is to try and accept it and move past it.  If you react in a strong way to every cough, you're reinforcing in your head that it is something to be concerned about and your brain will encourage you to have a panic reaction every time - *because you are teaching it's something to be concerned about*. 

Look up Claire Weekes and read some of her stuff - she was a doctor from the late 60s I think who was far ahead of her time for dealing with anxiety.  Everything she taught is still applicable, and she dealt a great deal with health anxiety."

I'm not super familiar with OCD coping techniques but if they are similar to anxiety I'd say when the thought/concern comes up next to accept it as just that - a thought - but do not pursue it any further.  Don't go to google, don't come here to post about worrying about it, don't get a pregnancy test, just acknowledge the thought as harmless and try and continue with your day.

Anxiety,fkvus3i,t3_fkzup4,1584577154.0,"Have you heard of the spoons theory? 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory

Essentially we're all allotted a number of ""spoons"" to spend on activities in a segment of time. For each stressful thing you spend a spoon.  When you're out of spoons, a break-down follows (which could be a panic attack for some people).

Right now, it just sounds like you are low on spoons.  

This is all really relatable to me... I'll feel completely fine and then suddenly I'm locking myself in the bathroom convinced I'm going to die because I'm in the throes of a bad panic attack.  I have never been very good at acknowledging when too much is too much.  I specifically have a lot of heart anxiety as well when it gets bad.  

Try and take things one day at a time.  Plan out your DMV trip (I like to look on google to see when it's least busy), know that you're not alone in the slightest in getting your hours cut.  I'm very sorry to hear about your dad.  That alone would bring most people to this point of stress."
Anxiety,fksuqtb,t1_fkstjj9,1584498855.0,"I see what you mean.

The subreddit is in a weird place right now. The virus is all anyone (not just those with anxiety disorders) can talk about. About 80% of what is submitted relates to it in some fashion, and the other 20% gets completely lost in the fray. The sheer amount of virus-related posts also means they typically are ignored and not commented on by other users... 

The megathread started as a way to funnel those posts into one source that would (hopefully) help some people out, or at least help them to know they weren't the only one anxious about it. 

I don't think any thread can stay purely positive because of the nature of what's happening... People are anxious and expressing their worst fears, which are never going to be positive. I can't censor a person or a subreddit by removing them."

It's said in the thread a lot, but try and avoid social media for a while.  It just feeds the anxiety which doesn't do anyone any good. 

As far as the sexual dysfunction goes, you saying certain strains of weed brings it back a bit makes me wonder if it's being caused by depression.  As for myself the anxiety always seemed far more urgent than depression and I'm usually unaware I even am depressed until I started to look for early warning signs.  For me, this is wanting to sleep a lot more and finding very little entertaining.  Of course I'm not a doctor, but I'd bring it up with your psych and give it some thought.  If it's not that - don't be afraid to try another medication (perhaps when the current virus situation calms down if you're worried about anxiety)."

Because of this news is almost always overwhelmingly negative and it causes a situation to seem far worse than it actually is.  They want it to come off that way because again, that's how they make money.  

The science megathread has a lot of very good, educated information in it.  Do not download the app that shows you how the virus is spreading, it is only going to feed into your anxiety.  

I truly wish all of you the best and I hate that this is happening, we've been fielding so many posts from poor people who are terrified at the fault of news sources who simply want to make a buck.  Take care of yourselves and remember you're not alone!

You're at Universal Studios, there are tons of people around and that is enough to make anyone feel on edge, but especially an anxiety sufferer. Try and force the tension from your body, relax your shoulders, take some slow deep breaths.

It's rough being in a position where you start believing this is as good as life gets, and I highly recommend talking to a therapist if it at all possible - it sounds like a depression thought which is very commonly comorbid with anxiety. I wish there was more I could do to help you out immediately. At the very least, I find knowing you're not alone helps."

Anxiety,ezbc8o7,t3_d04bea,1567817997.0,"First suggestion would be to immediately make an appointment with whomever prescribes you meds and discuss this with them. They will be able to give you much better advice than any of us here on the internet! 

In saying that, your specific brand of anxiety is very relatable to me - nausea and fear of vomiting was one of my worst triggers. I took 1mg of Ativan daily for 5 years before gradually tapering off of it. I do not recommend taking it daily or longterm. The withdrawal was bad for me, and benzos have a tendency to cause flair ups of anxiety months after your last pill. But there is good news for you, you haven't been taking it long enough for that to have such a lengthy withdrawal! The tapering process is easy, your doctor can explain it to you. 

The hardest thing about Ativan is that it can make you feel so much better, it's easy to take it every day. I feel for you. Look into CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) if you can. I would recommend it to anyone with anxiety, it was a life changer for me. In the meantime, push yourself in small ways to start retraining your brain into knowing everything is actually okay. Those bad things you're convinced will happen won't happen."

Anxiety,evmdh8f,t3_ck2y5c,1564606537.0,"I have primarily health anxiety myself and the *best* advice I can give you (or anyone!) is to stop seeking reassurance for any feeling or ""symptom"" you may have. It is the hardest but most effective thing you can do. 

When you have a sensation that begins to trigger that reflex to turn to Google or whatever your reassurance behavior may be, let it float past as well as you can. This is going to be difficult at first, it will make the anxiety worse, but the more you practice the more rapidly it will improve. You will be retraining your brain to not be alarmed at the sensations you feel. 

There are a lot of books on health anxiety.  I just finished this one and I'd recommend it:
