BPD,fb98any,t1_fb90dqb,1576631947.0,"CW: mention of parents



How do you _get into_ that headspace when you roleplay? And how do you stay in it when people socially ""attack"" (make fun of, argues with, etc) your OC? I have trauma from my parents arguing and screaming a lot at me me and with eachother, so being in that situation again triggers me. Even if it's just playing pretend.

I'm thinking of dressing up as my character when playing. It might feel silly but it might help me get into the right headspace. What do you think?

Yes, this time I'm playing with my SO and three other pretty close friends + a new friend. I wasn't that close to the last group, especially the dungeon/game master. I think I can be comfortable enough to call them out if something is wrong. :)

That is all really good advice, thank you!"
BPD,fb97875,t1_fb78xbe,1576631152.0,Yeah I definitely relate to not knowing who I am as a person. How am I supposed to imagine myself as someone else if I don't even know myself tho? Lmao

asktransgender,f62r5kp,t3_byzv4u,1572665647.0,"I think it's a big shame that they chose nonbinary/trans characters to be violent. It's the same with Angela's mother, who seems to have had abusive tendencies. It's definitely amazing that the show has such diverse characters, but I really wish they could've handled it better. Tuesday's fan, Cyll-something, is very obviously lesbian or perhaps bi, and she's violent too. Also, the three gender-nonconforming characters are seen as ridiculous for breaking gender roles. A big shame, really. Made me almost wish they didn't have any LGBTQ+ characters at all and definitely not any ""jokes"" about ""h*rmaph*dites""."

BPD,ewom033,t3_cpcz9k,1565621336.0,"Headaches are VERY common with anxiety-based mental illnesses, because your brain is overworked with thoughts all the time. It's not surprising you get headaches if you have BPD because your brain is constantly overthinking things. That said, it could also be chronic in your case. I think it's worth looking into if you've had headaches for several years non-stop. 
But yeah, no, you're not alone with having a lot of headaches, it's very common. That doesn't mean you have to deal with it though! Meet with a doctor to see if it's chronic pain, or if it's ""just"" anxiety. Maybe you could get special help for it.
