Needafriend,fiueo2f,t3_f9wha7,1582739958.0,"I don’t understand why people think money will solve problems. Especially mental illness. I’m not rich but I’m stable with income...and that doesn’t not help at all with what I battle with every day. If I were to trade places with someone “rich” I’d be happy for half a day. I’d probably be even more depressed, and I think that would be the same scenario for almost every person that truly is battling with real issues they have no control over. Don’t mean to piss anyone off, everyone has their own opinions. I think there just needs to be more education on how you can change someone’s life that is battling with something hard. Money will never be the issue in my opinion."
