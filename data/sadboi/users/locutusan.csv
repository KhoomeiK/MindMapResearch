AskReddit,fr2plx6,t3_gm0bz9,1589841497.0,"Holy shit. I was thinking I could never remember such a story but I have a good one. I used to work at a friends (joe) tattoo shop as a helper and one night another friend we’ll call him drunk Nate is in getting a tattoo. Now I’m helping Joe and he is tattooing a memorial tattoo for our friend who had recently passed (small town) on drunk Nate while drunk Nate is rambling very drunkenly and loudly to the other patrons. Joe asked me to wet the tattoo with “that green soap right there” which is what they use to wipe the tattoo clean. I did as he asked and he wiped the tattoo down. Then he looks at the towel. Looks at the bottle. “Did you use this one?” I said yes. He gets this look on his face and then bursts out laughing. “we just sprayed madacide all over this tattoo” Madacide is what they use to disinfect the countertops so I basically sprayed some lysol on drunk Nate’s open wound. He didn’t even flinch though and he wasn’t paying attention to us at all so we just played it off. He survived. Tl;dr friend was tattooing another friend while I helped, through miscommunication we used a surface disinfectant on the tattoo."

Whether they eat corn like most beef cattle or grass so they can pander to the “conscious” consumer demo, it makes no difference. An artificially brief dribble of existence is not a life. Not only do we now have the ability to create abundant sources of sustainable, plant-based protein for all humans but it is exactly what we need to reverse the horrible effects that a century of industrial meat production has wreaked on our atmosphere and our water. What we have done with meat in our culture is not natural or normal in any way."
