Fun story:

A group of middle aged blonde ladies riding rented bikes stopped me in that exact spot to take a picture for them about three or so years ago. I said okay, thinking it would just be a quick snap, and I could then go about my business, playing Pok√©mon Go with my brother, a friend, and my girlfriend. I take one and they all look at it and ask that I take another, at a different angle for better lighting. ‚ÄúIght‚Äù i thought. I can understand this. 

Cut to a few minutes later, I‚Äôve told them three times now that my friends are waiting for me but they have me take about 40 more. (Exaggerating a lot, but I was in a hurry to catch up to my pals, so come on.)

Light bulb.

After the fourth or fifth picture, they find the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù spot. Little do they know, I turned the camera around and took probably 200 pictures of my own face before just handing the phone back to the ladies and deucing hahahaha.

Thanks for reminding me of that day.
