trees,ezunl0b,t3_d2eihi,1568156580.0,"sounds like you need a t-break! Theres really no rhyme or reason as to when you need it, sometimes I take 2 t-breaks in 2 months and then sometimes I don't take a t-break for 2 months straight! Just listen to your body when it comes to tolerance and depending how high the tolerance feels take an appropriate t-break! mine are usually 1-2 weeks but I'm currently taking a 1 month break ;D Hope this helps!"

Drugs,eugpyo2,t1_eugoxp0,1563812696.0,"I try to be open about it, by saying what im gonna smoke (strain and way of smoking) and try to explain a little about it, because something is less scary if its familiar. I showed her my raw papers and asked if she wanted to learn about a joint and she just said no.

And Ill definetly look up alexis and show her!"
Drugs,eugpqsl,t1_eugoh0j,1563812579.0,"That's basically what I'm trying to do, it's difficult when I come home and she ruins my high with ""why do you smoke when you know it impairs your brain development?"
Drugs,eugobqg,t1_eugjyhu,1563811808.0,"I never smoke at home, and I am not addicted. I usually smoke daily but when I notice any issues arise I take tolerance breaks/cut down use. I am extremely conscious about my smoking habits."

I also tried explaining that theres a bigger picture, everything has positives and negatives, but she doesn't listen she just waits to talk."
Drugs,eugnmhc,t1_eugjzj4,1563811419.0,"Of course I asked her worries, she just wants me to be safe - I told her the safest way to smoke is at home and she just said no. I have to go out and smoke with friends, and have to get driven home while everyone is high, which is a lot less safe than just smoking at home."
