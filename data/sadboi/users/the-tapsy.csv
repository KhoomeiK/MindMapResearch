fantasywriters,fnz0937,t3_g4qdyi,1587382129.0,"Some cool ideas, but I can kinda tell this is a first draft. Some punctuation and grammar errors here and there, and the story beats are choppy. We went from introducing the characters, to them doing magic, to them being attacked and captured. Way too much going on for a single page, and doesnt give the reader enough time to digest or even imagine whats going on.

If this is your first chapter, I think you should take the time to introduce the characters and their world a bit more. Who is Kujoe and Kandake? Where do they live and who are they as people? What are their problems? Why should we care about their problems?

Also I can tell you are very imaginative, and thats excellent, but the way you describe and detail things sometimes feels a little too much. Be a bit more reserved when it comes to descriptions or else things will feel too unbelievable, like when ""Kujoe's ribs shattered."" Im sure you meant that it really hurt him when he was struck, but most people would think that Kujoe's bones literally broke into tiny pieces (which means killing him, of course).

Overall there's potential. Would like to read what it becomes in the future."

He was supposed to be the big hero that's gonna unite dorne and the targaryens, and that was the only ending acceptable in his mind, but that isnt how the world of ice and fire works and it ends in horror for him instead.

From what I've read about you, I can tell you are an incredibly strong, caring, and responsible person. Even with a debilitating mental illness and thoughts of suicide, you are still holding on and finding some means to live not just for yourself, but for your partner and your pets whom I'm sure you love very much. That's a Herculean feat that sadly isn't celebrated as much as it should be in a society like ours. In our societal context dropping out of school and losing a job equates to not having value, but I'm telling you that is complete BS, because you are so worthwhile for this world regardless of those things, so important and beautiful and you deserve the life and happiness you desire. None of this is your fault and in many ways society has failed you. 

I'm begging you, don't let your story end here. It doesn't get better, but YOU can. There are still a million ways for you to get stronger, happier, wiser, and love and be loved in return. You CAN get better, and you can get so good at this whole being alive thing that one day you'll wonder why you ever thought otherwise. 

I'm sorry if I didn't say the right things, I am also just a 23 year old at the worst time of my life, but if anything I just want you to know that I and this community acknowledge you and all you've gone through. We hear your pain and I wish you the very best this world has to offer."

He was joking that he 'was too dumb for kojumbo' and really the video proved that he was. Not that walking simulator type games are too artistic or high intellect or whatever, but that those types of games some gamers truly enjoy, and he just showed that he's too small-minded to understand that."

Are there mules in the way? Hmm maybe I'll use the decoy cargo this time. Do I wanna take a trike and risk not being able to find a path or just walk it out? 

The game's designed in a way that it feels rewarding to work through all of those details, though admittedly the game is easy enough that all we really have to worry about is not falling over.  I still think the concept is sound though and if the game wasnt so experimental I think Kojima could have made traversal hard enough that those details become important."
