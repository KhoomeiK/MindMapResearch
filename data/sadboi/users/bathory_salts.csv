Would be different if you were responding to this because you have your partner, truck, equipment, ability to call for other resources...etc. If you agree..it's just you. With no equipment or anything. I'm a primary care paramedic as well, and although we do get some training to help deliver babies, it really isn't our specialty since we aren't obstetricians. That and if things are going wrong,you could potentially have 2 patients with mom and baby and be easily overwhelmed. My asshole usually puckers a little responding to pregnancy calls anyways, I couldn't fathom delivering a child for a family member on my own without any equipment or other medical personnel. I would stress this to your family, that yes you are a healthcare professional, but you specialize in emergency prehospital care, not obstetrics."

She wasn't the best driver , but we were all camping and thought that she couldn't fuck up going down a trail. I was like maybe 10. The quad we were driving was big , 800cc, and had a backseat kind of a level above the main seat. Anyways, I was sitting in the back seat and felt an urge to slide down and wedge myself between the seat and my aunt.

My aunt was driving too fast, and the quad caught on a log and directed the quad into a tree. My aunt took a lot of the force but I didn't go anywhere because I had wedged myself inbetween the seats. My aunt had (and still) has lots of hip procedures and problems."
