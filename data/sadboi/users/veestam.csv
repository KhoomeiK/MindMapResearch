attemptsurvivor,fo32cwc,t3_e6nzo3,1587479219.0,"Dying is scary. Humans evolved to fear death and take actions towards not dying. It is completely normal to feel scared to die. If anyone bullies you for that, they are just trying to get a reaction out of you and do not care about you. Don't worry about what they have to say. I'm glad you are still alive."
attemptsurvivor,fo31yzx,t3_g58f5o,1587479005.0,"Speaking as a suicide attempt survivor researcher, one thing you can do is remind her that there are people in her life who support her and love her. Remind her that you are her friend and you care about her; even highlight some of the things you love about her. After a while, feel free to keep the conversation light, sending her memes or cute cat videos. Just continue, even if she doesn't reciprocate or respond. 

If you have a chance to have a conversation with her about what happened, perhaps you could plant the seed that maybe she survived for a reason or that this could be the start of a new life path. Maybe explore with her her hopes and dreams (if she's ready). 

If she ever discloses suicidal thoughts to you, be sure to have her contact a crisis hotline like Kids Help Phone (or you can as well) - they will work with her to bring her down from a hot moment and even coordinate a rescue if needed.
