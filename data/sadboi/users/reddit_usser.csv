But i prefer elbow wraps over sleeves for heavy bench if there is elbow pain."
Stronglifts5x5,fe5uxxm,t3_enpiqk,1578875523.0,"Good squat man.

I see your left foot maybe a bit forward than the right. I have the same issue where my left foot is slightly forward or backward than the right and sometimes at a different angle than the other.

I can only adjust them to be equal when i can look downward. But when i am squatting heavy its really hard to look down as i do front squats. Looking at the mirror, its hard to figure out.

When i lower the weight n look down at my feet and try with the unadjusted and adjusted foot position, i feel a huge difference and a good solid squat with adjusted/equal foot positioning. No matter the weight low or high, when i unrack and get in position my feet are not in line and not at same angle unless i look at my feet and adjust.

Is there a way to fix this when unracking squats?
Anyone who could help?"

Unfortunately i havent tried running it on mac as i got windows.
I have disabled the window resizing settings. If u can delete the gui. resizable(False, False) statement in sorting_gui.py script, it will let u resize the window.You will find it at the end of the script.

And thanks for letting know. I wonder if this is due to different displays or is it windows vs mac issue"
