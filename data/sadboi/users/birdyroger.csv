I was so depressed that I tried to kill myself several times.  This went on for freaking decades, from 1966 to about 2015.  

About 5 years ago I switched to a ketogenic diet and my depression pretty much evaporated.  I still had some physical problems so I switched to a carnivorous diet about 2 years ago and my mood got even better.  Since I was 72 at the time, it was inevitable that I would continue to have some physical issues.  So I started fasting and doing grounding.  Things got even better again.  Two months ago I started supplementing with vitamin D/sunbathing thanks to CoViD-19, and pretty much everything got much better.

I have shared this information with depressives before and they pretty much all slammed me and denigrated me and said that I was lying or that their depression was real, implying that mine was fake or false or somehow unreal, despite the slash marks on my wrists and the history of no social life.  I am completely cool with most of you slamming me this time around and calling me a liar or being so stupid as to claim that it will only work for me, despite the fact that ketogenic people and carnivorous people ALL say exactly the same thing.  I am completely unaffected by people who insist upon remaining depressed.  Really.  If you want to continue being depressed, I am OK with that.
