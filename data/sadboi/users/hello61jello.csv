UIUC,fo49qpm,t1_fo4406i,1587500617.0,"Wow I thought I was the only one. My TA took off points from my essay because he just FELT like I plagiarized. He had no proof or anything and couldn't even show me which part. It's like they're afraid to give 100% or something. I have the same problem with discussions, I get points off although I try hard and participate. The missing points are adding up even with the extra credit and I don't wanna get a B in a gen ed that would be just sad. Is she picky with essays too? I have a different TA but the same problem. This is so strange."
UIUC,fnnumhj,t1_fn4y7vd,1587102225.0,"Alright, thank you! multiple choice right? Just making sure cause some old quiz questions had short answer"
UIUC,fm56e94,t1_fm3jorp,1585767168.0,Damn maybe he changed the course a bit. We still only have one exam though. Do you remember if you had to study for the quizzes?
UIUC,fm3j7uw,t1_f6mc58d,1585725411.0,Did you have to read the book? How was the exam?
UIUC,flflnze,t1_fhzywuj,1585109946.0,How did the course end up being? I'm concerned that the grading is harsh cause there is quite a bit of assignments for this class.
UIUC,fl9dkue,t1_fkd526a,1584950852.0,"yup I dropped it cause ain't nobody got time. I think the course changed this year. From what I heard before there weren't any exams in this class :(
I think there were exams last semester but it had easier questions and they gave them the answers in discussion. Idk about yall but discussion didn't give me any answers"
UIUC,fl7ydj7,t1_fl5nf8g,1584912010.0,For which one?
depression,fhk3qwv,t1_fhk1otd,1581665497.0,I'm 22 and still never had a boyfriend. I remember kinda panicking about it at 18 though... l still had hope back then. Little did I know nothing is going to happen for me any time soon :(
depression,fhk39ct,t3_f2qwaw,1581664895.0,"Yup. I'm a premed student and depression hit me full force halfway through college. Suddenly I couldnt get out of bed, had no motivation, no memory, became socially awkward (also replayed convos like you do), and became literally stupid. The brain fog just doesn't go away. I used to be sharp, thats the reason I went in as pre-med. Now because of depression I dont think I'm going to be able to go to Medical School. Everyone is disappointed in me and now thinks I'm just stupid. I just cant think. Depression broke my brain."
