As always, I'd recommend getting a early start to avoid potential tubers and see more wildlife - COVID or not.

Note: There are rapids past this point, and even possibly a dam or two, depending on how far you want to go.

* SMRR to Scull's Crossing: 4 miles (Cottonseed Rapids - Class II - around 2.8 miles down; you will probably need to take out or portafe BEFORE the bridge at Scull's, because the bridge can have little clearance in medium-high water; river right is likely the better take out. Parking is pretty limited at Scull's Crossing IIRC, so I'd definitely go early if this is your plan.)
* SMRR to Martindale: 6-7 miles (same as Scull's; once you get to the Martindale Dam, you will 100% need to portage river right; shortly after the dam is the Martindale Low Water Crossing bridge - portage right again; you could take out river left at Allen Bates City Park, which is just a bit past the bridge and open according the the Martindale City website, or even Shady Grover Campground - just check if it's open)

More information about canoeing and kayaking this area from SMRR [here](http://sanmarcosriverretreat.com/page-9.html).

Also, any of the State Parks on the river would work, if you can snag a reservation - Palmetto, Blanco, Guadalupe. Another helpful place to check is the [TPWD Paddling Trails](https://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/boat/paddlingtrails/) \- pretty sure a lot of these are still accessible, but just double check."
