mentalillness,fpeyaht,t3_gcszpe,1588557566.0,Yes everyday. The smallest little thing can set me off into a rage then a crippling state of depression with constant uncontrollable crying. The ones that really suck are when I’m feeling 100% okay then the next thing I know the tears just start rolling and it feels like every thing I know just shuts down. Sorry for venting as well but I’m currently in a pretty fucked state of mind. I hope you are doing better than I currently am.

LifeProTips,f4md3dp,t1_f4kz5qi,1571676907.0,It’s sad seeing all the trash that gets thrown into the streets once the year is up. I went to my friends graduation at UCSB this past June and it was astonishing seeing the mounds of trash being piled up in the streets. Sure enough you see people digging through the piles looking for recyclable metals and other valuables that can be salvaged. You’d be surprised from the amount of quality items these students throw away with no remorse what so ever.
