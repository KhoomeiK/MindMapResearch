raisedbynarcissists,fr62l2y,t3_gdku9g,1589918811.0,"I Am 20 almost 21 now and all throughout my life, my NF was never around. Always about his own needs and desires. He certainly provides my family with the financial support, but emotional nothing. Back in 2018- he cheated on my mom and they had lots of arguments. I was there for my mom. They are back together now.

Now he has my mom (who is cautious about coronavirus) flying back and forth to Florida. My mom is never around for me anymore. Like they are home for less than a week and then they fly back. It's like I don't even matter anymore and their needs supersede. Sometimes, I think Im making it about myself, but you know it hurts when someone you were around your whole life just ditches you to fly back and forth to Florida. And they are like flying back during a pandemic and plan to move down.

My dad does not give a flying fuck about the pandemic and is still living life as normal. I am very worried for the safety of my mom- because I do not want her to get sick. But she is just following along with whatever he does and when my mom tries to point out what is wrong- absolutely nothing 

My frustration- I cannot even elaborate- I'm infuriated and hate how its always about him."

I am 20 almost 21 and my parents are 60/61. We are from the northeast, but my mom and dad have been traveling back and forth to Florida. Whenever, I try to point out the dangers- they are like chill we will be fine. But what if they are not fine, because I no for sure that they are not social distancing in Florida. They are still living life as normal. And my dad is the type that does whatever he wants- he doesn’t care, so if I try to base my argument off of facts, well it’s useless. 

It’s really annoying because they are putting their lives  and others in danger by going back and forth to Florida like it’s still the pre coronavirus era. 


It’s infuriating."

I will admit- I do have disgust towards Trump supporters where basic human rights are neglected such as with the LGBT+ community. Generalizations don’t help anyone. A lot of the time, both political sides immediately are defensive and are ready to fight with one another. I think both sides need to learn that they will be wrong and to listen to another point of view. Instead of instantly name calling, I think we just need to have a civil discussion and let each other speak. I know that’s very difficult though.

I'm a current college sophomore and to say the least, my transcript is absolutely terrible. Before I begin, I want to study mental health counseling or school counseling in graduate school.

Back when I was 15 years old, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, which had disastrous effects on my college performance. In spring of 2018, I had to withdraw from all classes (not an easy decision to make!) because my medical team said that it will be best for my health. Anyways- Ill stop rambling and get to the root of my worries.

This is why Im worried:

\- I only take 12 credits per semester

\-I received one C in a non- major class

\-Tried to take 16 credits this current semester but Withdrew from a major class (Statistics)

I'm so worried that grad schools are going to look down on me because of my academic performance. And it's awful enough that I had to withdraw from a major class. I am not a dumb person- I just have an autoimmune disease that flares up terribly.

With my history, do I still have a chance at getting into a program?
