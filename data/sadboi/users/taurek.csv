pornfree,fice9p0,t1_fiaymkt,1582344613.0,"Yeah my therapist knows I'm back into self injury. I did super well for many years but slipped back. It used to be an addiction for me. 
I know it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to most people, but the best way I can explain it is that the physical pain is something to focus on. Something that hurts but not emotionally. It's a way to detach from emotion and focus only on physical pain. I also would imagine as the blood dripped out that it carried with it the sadness and sins. 

As to why we got together, we were both very broken people. I was insecure and alone. Was recovering from a few very bad relationships, one of which was terribly abusive and one which was..... Well.... Statatory. But wow was I obsessed with him and it broke me when he broke it off because he was going to be moved to a different city to preach. Except that was a lie and he just wanted a younger girlfriend.

I was also trying to get out of my abusive mother's house and sorta clamped on to the person who was safest. He had been cheated on ALOT and was super clingy. Also jealous... But he wasn't violent towards me, so that was an improvement. And the clingyness made me feel secure. He also had a strong catholic family thus providing support I didn't have before. So we leaned on each other, and at the beginning the sex was decent, but he was living in his parents house and I was first in mom's place then a halfway house for homeless youth. When we finally got an apartment on our own sex became more important and began to be a bit of an issue.

But at that same time, he started taking antidepressants. He claimed they really dampened his mood, which may have been true to a point.... Although now I think it was just an easy excuse because he wouldn't go in to get them changed to something else. He said he went but they wouldn't change them, which I now think was a lie. But the pills made him a lot better so going off wasn't an option anyway."

And I guess I know why now. Always assumed it was just facebook or candy crush or something..... 
So I hope we can improve the communication if he stops just going to look at porn whenever we r having troubles."

I am mostly traumatized by the fact that we've had a deadbedroom for Soooo many years. I used to cry myself to sleep at least twice a week because he didn't want to have sex with me. And this whole time he told me it was just the antidepressants he was on making his libido low but everytime he went to the dr he said they said there wasnt any others he could try. And he for sure needs them. 
But his libido was never low. 
And he let me feel like shit about it for so long.
So long he let me cry and feel bad about myself because he was too much of a coward to man up and admit that he has a problem. And too coward to leave. 

I've had self esteem issues for years and got back into cutting because it was the only comfort I could find when he wouldn't hold me. 

That ended when I had baby girl. Her love has literally saved my life. 

So I am very traumatized and hurt and it is so hard to try to be supportive in him getting over his addiction when I kinda just want him to feel the lain hes put me through....
But thats not helpful at all. 
So I'm working on it with my therapist.

I have decided to apply all over the U.S. But it is pretty terrifying. I've never been out of the midwest, and I have a 3yr old and husband Ill be taking with me. But I kinda knew I'd have to move away even when I started my undergrad.

Except that I am running out of openings to apply for.......unless more get posted soon. 

I did get one place that contacted me back and said if I do the background check I can put my name in for the position that is opening in July, so that could be good.

There have been many stories of people who receive organs changing to get some characteristics of the person who died. For example the dead person's dog recognizing them or something bizzare like that. 
So somewhere deep inside I have this belief that if your body parts are put inside someone else your ""soul"" or essence or whatever can't rest. In that way technically you would still be ""alive"".
Maybe some people would like to continue living through body parts idk.


But if I had a choice of get someone elses body part or die. I am leaning very much to die. (Wouldn't know for sure til faced with that actual choice but yeah)

Therefore I don't want to donate my parts.

It would make so much sense if this is what I've had my whole life and just had absolutely no idea. The amount of times I have sprained my ankle is just absolutely pathetic. I sent a msg to my primary dr to ask who I would need to schedule an apt with to do the genetic test.
labrats,f2rcbfh,t3_de38r8,1570371800.0,Keep your current position. Grant funding is not guaranteed until in hand. Our lab got approved for a grant and didnt get the money. They cut it in half and gave it to us a year later.
ADHD,f2qkd6p,t3_ddtykc,1570363389.0,"Make a list of things that need to be done. Then identify which was seems the least boring. Do that first. Cross off list. Like really scribble that shit off. Feels amazing. Repeat until list is done. 

That's what works for me. If it is boring and not on the list it doesn't happen. If I don't write anything down I feel like I did absolutely nothing."
CSFLeaks,f2hcegs,t1_f2h6qvg,1570241987.0,How do you make an apt for a genetist? I've never heard of that before for anything other than during pregnancy to assess probabilities of diseases being passed on.
CSFLeaks,f2h4c0l,t1_f2eke7n,1570239225.0,"Headaches change a little bit in nature from day to day. But typically either behind my eyes or back of my neck. My neck and shoulders hurt too. 
I am nauseated and having trouble eating. I don't like to try to eat when I've been dry heaving all day. 
I also have light sensitivity but that is not terribly new. I have sensitive eyes so some kinds of light hurt. 
I also feel a swishing in my head. The best way to describe it is like if i turn my head too quickly my brain will slide right out my ear. Standing up or bending over make swooshes as well. The swishing isnt always super painful, just weird and my whlle balance is thrown off"
CSFLeaks,f2h35r9,t1_f2eyh9g,1570238801.0,"I have never heard of that before. I do have very flexible joints and I can pop them out very easily. I like to sleep on my side but I use many pillows because if I don't I will pop my shoulder out in my sleep and wake up in excruciating pain. This has happened many times when not in my own bed.
I also get a lot if clicking and popping in my joints."
migraine,f2e77gf,t3_dcqp0v,1570184644.0,"Oh crap. I never really got migraines until after having my daughter 2 years ago. I had an epidural go wrong and they blood patched it twice. Sometimes I wonder if my spine is still leaking. 
But it used to be the headaches would go away as long as I laid on my back, but last month that stopped working so I figured it musg be something else. Now I'm not so sure...."
AskReddit,f29on8x,t3_dcnq7e,1570101783.0,"I sing little songs to myself as I do things when in a good mood. It's like narrating in song. It doesn't seem weird to people when my two year old is around but I started doing it long before She was born.
Just imagine a person singing ""imma lockin my car, lockin my car, lockity lockity lockin da car!"" As they do a small jig and proceed on their way like nothing happened. 
That is me."
AskReddit,f1wbbkg,t3_datygg,1569782613.0,Putting the pleasure zone next to the waste facility seems like a pretty poor design to me
labrats,f1w3wxn,t1_f1v66mj,1569779903.0,"I had turned a 200 to 203 when trying to get it to 200 from 150 when the person freaked out. It is so easy to slip past that exactly 200 mark and I couldn't imagine accidently over by a click or two would end the world. 
I would suppose as long as it isnt taken so far that the numbers stop it should be able to be recalibrated. 
After working in a lab for 3 years I have definately accidentally pushed the limits on a few of our pipets. Went to 220 a few times by accident"
labrats,f1rmo3p,t1_f1r4apm,1569717492.0,"We have 3 100 to 1000 pipettes that are broken, and it happened something like that but they were cranked within range. But i guess thats what happens when you buy pipettes from amazon...."
labrats,f1qbgpu,t3_daiizk,1569697396.0,"I once had someone freak out because if you turn it too far one way or the other it would be permanently broken. 
Of course if that was true they would have made it so they cant go farther than they should"
bipolar,f1o3m8x,t1_f1nlfqz,1569633749.0,"I have been on all the common ssris and they haven't worked well at all. I had a very bad reaction to Prozac. It made me super suicidal after only taking it for like 2 weeks. Most of the others either don't work at all or give me such horrible headaches I can't function. Citalopram was the best but still gave me headaches and restless legs. 

Kinda feels like a ""toss some drugs at the wall and see what sticks"" philosophy in psychiatry.....

I've had troubles my whole life, which might be why she's leaning twords adhd instead of bipolar. Idk. Feels like just guessing..."
bipolar,f1o34oi,t1_f1nmjum,1569633377.0,"I am on lamictal right now, and I have never felt so good. I have 200 mg. I was doing so well this summer and finally got off of citalopram which was the only antidepressant that ever actually helped but gave me horrid restless legs and headaches. 
The GP i see tried putting me on propanolol for migraines and that didn't work so she wanted to do topamax or amitriptyline but said that id have to talk to my pyschiatrist to make sure it didnt interact and whatnot. Psych today said she wanted to avoid ssris because of potential mania..... Then put me on a stimulant instead. 
She can be very confusing sometimes and i just wish i knew what was actually wrong with me . . ."
migraine,f1d8fc4,t3_d8ttao,1569376615.0,"I have this same fear as well. If you can try propanolol it is suppose to be super effective. Didnt work for me because I have chronically low bp so i was too dizzy on it. I still have some and will take it when i have one that wont go away and it works great. I just cant do it every day. 
My Dr mentioned topamax but they arent too sire to prescribe it due to possible complications from another med so id have to change that one too."

migraine,f1d7qfj,t3_d8qkm2,1569376085.0,"To be fair, most narcotics really arent that great for headaches. A lot of other medications are far more effective. I was given Percocet fir my migraine once and it did absolutely nothing. Just made me feel tired thats it. 
Some tordahl, benedryl and nausea meds are so much more effective"

SleepApnea,f13x15p,t1_f13um3i,1569166615.0,"Because there is no way I could ever sleep with something on my face. I cant even sleep with headphones on, face mask on, ear plugs, socks, ect. (Yes socks. No idea why but if i am wearing socks i wont be able to fall asleep)"
SleepApnea,f13wq33,t1_f12wa5p,1569166501.0,Yeah. I was thinking we might have to do something like that. My dr has done a similar therapy with some other triggers.

The noise is from how the machine exausts, so i would guess we would have to find a mask that vents differently.
He always has a fan on in the room but his mask is right next to my head so it doesn't cut the noise much."
