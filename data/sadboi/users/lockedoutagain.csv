mildlyinfuriating,f5pizz9,t1_f5pit58,1572360529.0,It’s implying that people should lead by example/actions instead of just telling people how to live their lives.
AmItheAsshole,f5p1tih,t1_f5p1iga,1572344838.0,"He has admitted other places in this thread that he routinely gets angry about an incident and holds it against his wife, repeatedly bringing those incidents up in other disagreements. He has also stated that he will apologize if “she” feels he’s an abuser. And in the past he has apologized when “she” felt he was in the wrong. 

It seems there is quite a pattern of him not accepting and owning his mistakes with sincere apologies."
AmItheAsshole,f5p18sx,t3_dogeky,1572343999.0,Your justification for not being an abuser is further proof that you are absolutely a verbal abuser. You are also extremely petty that you are ignoring her even though you know you are clearly in the wrong. You do not have to physically hit someone to be an abuser and often verbally and mentally abusing someone makes it so much harder for them to leave. Admitting that you would let her leave says a lot about yourself and what you think of your horrific actions. You should be making an appointment with a counselor or therapist.
