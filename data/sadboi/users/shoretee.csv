Anxiety,fqau28v,t1_fqatk3w,1589225288.0,I did too! I’m sorry you feel that way too. I’m glad I’m not alone! We’re all suffering together. Hope it gets better for you!
Anxiety,fqapq0z,t1_fqak4th,1589223148.0,It really sucks! I’m sorry and I hope it gets better for you!
Anxiety,fqaaa4z,t1_fqa8f1g,1589215601.0,"Me too! I’m sorry that there are so many suffering with this, but it makes me feel better to know I’m not alone as well."
Anxiety,fq9sy2i,t1_fq9sfg7,1589206400.0,Thank you!
Anxiety,fq9se5b,t1_fq9qi7o,1589206070.0,Yes me too! Exactly this!
Anxiety,fq9s9q3,t1_fq9ocl8,1589205996.0,"Mine isn’t crippling, but it’s definitely frustrating. Thank you! I will try to look into your videos. I’m pretty sure I know where my trauma comes from, but I never really related it to these feelings because they don’t really have anything to do with each other. However a lot of my feelings from the trauma are self blame so I guess it could make sense that then those feeling could transfer into then feeling like I’m to blame for others feelings as well."
Anxiety,fq9rf37,t1_fq9ngpl,1589205479.0,"I’m glad I’m not alone and that in itself is strangely comforting, but I’m sad that so many other people suffer from this problem. I’ve almost actually been enjoying the stay home stuff because it’s taken the pressure and anxiety off of having to go to social interactions."
Anxiety,fq9r2lt,t1_fq9lrhe,1589205269.0,"I don’t get it with my husband at all. But others in my family and friends for sure. I actually have totally been saying this. I feel bad not seeing my family and friends, but I have not missed the pressure and anxiety that comes along with being social."
Anxiety,fq9qsko,t1_fq9lkew,1589205098.0,I’m so sorry. I totally do this too! At least we’re not alone in our suffering. Hope it gets better and you’re able to sleep.
Anxiety,fq9qm74,t1_fq9lgmp,1589204989.0,It sucks! I’m sorry you’re dealing with it too!
Anxiety,fq9qkt7,t1_fq9l35d,1589204964.0,That sucks! It seems to be the opposite for me. It’s more with people I know and care about. Strangers are easier to not care about their feelings cuz I’ll probably never see them again.
Anxiety,fq9qe33,t1_fq9k1l4,1589204848.0,Yes I’ve said this too! I feel bad not seeing my family and friends but the relief from social anxiety has been amazing!
Anxiety,fq9q8w6,t1_fq9imdr,1589204759.0,Do I get like a t-shirt or something? /s
Anxiety,fq9q738,t1_fq9il8k,1589204729.0,It definitely helps to know I’m not alone. Though I feel bad others are suffering as well.
Anxiety,fq9fkga,t1_fq9f5cs,1589196657.0,Yes! And that’s almost worse because no matter how many times you replay the interaction it’s still positive so you’re just left with horrible feelings you can’t explain.
Anxiety,fq9e62c,t1_fq9dwiq,1589195302.0,"Yea I try to tell myself all the time I don’t have to care what other people think, but it’s easier said than done for sure."
Anxiety,fq9dufl,t1_fq9d67d,1589194980.0,I get this way too. It sucks when you don’t even feel like interacting with people you like. Hope it gets better!
Anxiety,fq9dryo,t1_fq9askv,1589194909.0,It’s horrible! Hope it gets better for all of us!
Anxiety,fq9dqam,t1_fq9arzy,1589194861.0,That would make sense. Sorry it happens to you too.
Anxiety,fq9dm5r,t1_fq98u7j,1589194745.0,Yes I hate those feelings! It makes even positive social interactions exhausting. Hope it gets better for you!
Anxiety,fq9dekb,t1_fq9cvzp,1589194527.0,Thank you so much! Sending a comforting hug right back at ya!
Anxiety,fq9db8x,t1_fq9cnit,1589194434.0,"Yes me too, it happens even if that interaction was a pleasant one. 

Thats very interesting about the shame and not something I would have thought of, but could make sense. I’ll have to look up that book, thank you! Glad you’ve found something that’s helping!"
Anxiety,fq9cs2o,t1_fq9c7cg,1589193885.0,Glad there’s more good people than bad. That still sucks though. Why can’t people you have to see everyday just be nice to each other? Even if you don’t like them you can act like a civilized adult and be kind and not make peoples lives harder. May a bird poop on their heads...😉
Anxiety,fq9cik4,t1_fq9c2tu,1589193615.0,Yea I do this too. Just replaying every conversation over and over again trying to figure out what you did. It’s very exhausting. I hope it gets better for you!
Anxiety,fq9cdhv,t1_fq9bml9,1589193469.0,"I had to look this up, but yes I have gotten this feeling several times in the past as well. It’s the worst. Wondering if you’re going to die if you don’t take it seriously or if you’ll be laughed at if you do take it seriously."
Anxiety,fq9c83a,t1_fq9bk74,1589193316.0,"I get this feeling too. I’m sure you’re not as much of a weirdo as you think you are though. My husband is one of the weirdest people I’ve ever met but also the best person I’ve ever met, so don’t beat yourself up too much about feeling like a weirdo. Sometimes that’s ok."
Anxiety,fq9byjs,t1_fq9bcgr,1589193037.0,I’m sorry that sounds horrible to have to go to work with people like that everyday. I hope it gets better for you!
Anxiety,fq9bu5w,t1_fq9a0zp,1589192910.0,"Yes I’ve literally asked the person/people before as well and usually that does bring peace. It just sucks cuz it’s usually not until at least the next day that I can talk to them. Glad I’m not alone, but sorry you deal with it too!"
Anxiety,fq9bnez,t1_fq97a4g,1589192718.0,Exactly! Thank you for the advice! I’m sorry you’re dealing with these feelings as well.
Anxiety,fq9bj34,t1_fq94pva,1589192592.0,Yes I have sleeping troubles as well unfortunately. Hope it gets better for you!
Anxiety,fq9bhe8,t1_fq95gb8,1589192542.0,"I haven’t heard of cognitive distortions, I’ll try to look into that. Thank you! Sorry you have to deal with it at well."

TooAfraidToAsk,fmsfz28,t1_fmqq7yx,1586354667.0,This! My step mom posted a photo of my niece and nephew riding 4 wheelers in her backyard abd said “social distancing on the four wheelers today” and I really wanted to comment “just the fact that they are at your house when they don’t live there means you’re NOT social distancing!!!”
TooAfraidToAsk,fmsfa8e,t3_fwudye,1586354252.0,"Yes! I’m so frustrated with most people I know! I got a text from my step sister saying my nieces grandma was exposed so she didn’t want my niece over there and asked if I could watch her. Understandable but when I asked when she was exposed knowing my niece was already over there she said it was around the same time so my niece could already be exposed. So I nicely told her we didn’t want her over. And I get “Oh she doesn’t have it, but it’s fine” how the f do you know? If she was exposed she might. She could even have it and never show symptoms. So instead she got her ex and my parents to watch her. Potentially exposing even more people. 

My parents are still having all three of my step siblings and their kids over multiple times. Including the niece who was possibly exposed. It’s like don’t you understand the number of people you’re putting at risk? My step mom keeps trying to make my daughter feel bad about it. She keeps making passive aggressive comments like “Are you tired of being stuck in your house yet? Do you want to come play with (niece)” Do you miss (niece) we miss you soo much” every time  she FaceTimes with her. 


We’ve been trying to stay home and only go out for groceries etc. but we live with my bro in law (we rent the house from him and he moved back into the basement after breaking up with his girlfriend 2 years ago.) He doesn’t handle being bored well and keeps leaving the house. He said he’s not going around anyone but then his best friend comes over and then his girlfriend comes over and spends the night. And then we see another friend bring him home from riding mountain bikes the other day cuz he locked his keys in his car. When we say something his response is “oh it doesn’t matter cuz I was already around them last week” Ok but we weren’t and we don’t know who they’ve been around or where they’ve been! 

My mom has lupus and volunteered to go into work at a sporting good store because other people were calling in and didn’t want to risk it. I’m like mom you shouldn’t be risking it either! She says she needs the money but she qualifies for unemployment with her other job. 

My friends are still hanging out with all their siblings coming and going to their own homes having bbqs like normal etc. 

My mother in law takes care of the elderly so she is still working and helping these people. The 1st was her birthday so we dropped some flowers on her doorstep. My father in law who has severe lung problems and liver problems comes out and is teasing us for staying back and not coming in. It’s like don’t you understand we’re doing it for your own safety?  The next day my other bro in law is there doing laundry and teasing us as well for not coming in. I couldn’t live with my self if I was the reason one of them got sick and died nor would I want her to spread it to the elderly people she works with. 

I feel like nobody I know is taking it seriously! And it’s really hard to take it seriously and protect my family when people in my own house and family won’t stop leaving and getting together socially. 

We’ve been sanitizing all the door handles and light switches and faucets and anything else we believe he touches that we share, but it’s still hard. I should at least be able to feel safe in my own home and I can’t. UGH

Guess I needed to get this rant out."
CasualConversation,fktyzfx,t1_fktyshy,1584538412.0,Exactly! I’ve learned the hard way that we are never promised our loved ones for any amount of time not even for a second. So cherish them all. I just feel like this simple thing to do could be so important to your loved ones later.
unpopularopinion,fhp5xg3,t1_fhp5q2o,1581782740.0,"Right, I should just uproot my whole life and my kids lives to move out to the country where it might possibly be quieter cuz people never have dogs out in the country or on open farmlands. Nope. Never. 

Or how about if you’re going to own a dog you actually take the time to train and treat it right instead of using half your ass and being like “oh that’s just what dogs do”"
unpopularopinion,fhp5o4o,t1_fhp5474,1581782555.0,"So if my kids wants to stand in the yard and scream and yell for hours and hours every day, just because they’re a kid and likes to be vocal and loud, I should just let them as long as they’re not being neglected and have no consideration for anyone else around me or in my neighborhood?"
unpopularopinion,fhp111p,t1_fhp00og,1581779772.0,"Yes! Exactly!! Don’t have a dog if you don’t have the time to train and take care of it properly. They are living creatures that need attention, love and care not just a toy you can put away when you don’t want to play with it anymore. 

My roommate will leave his dogs home for 10-12 hours at a time alone and thinks leaving a lamp on for them makes them less lonely and helps them not bark so much when he gets home. He only takes then for short walks like once a week and then can’t figure out why they keep digging giant holes in our backyard. It’s like dude they’re barking when you get home cuz they’re fucking lonely. They want someone to pay attention to and play with them. But he’s always like “oh they don’t care about me, they’re just hungry” ugh..."
unpopularopinion,fhp0b2e,t1_fhozzet,1581779337.0,Not really much of a choice. It’s a house in a normal suburban neighborhood of the US. Not sure what else I could do short of moving to the country or interviewing all my neighbors to see if the have dogs before moving in.
unpopularopinion,fhozbib,t1_fhoypzr,1581778547.0,"Yes! Soo much this!! My problem isn’t so much with dogs but with their owners using half their asses to train, teach and take care them."
unpopularopinion,fhoybs7,t1_fhoxfsa,1581777727.0,Yes this! I know most of my problem is actually with dog owners and not the dogs themselves.
unpopularopinion,fhoy5i8,t1_fhoxp42,1581777583.0,"Sounds like you might be the exception lol. There are dogs and owners that I’ve met that I like. Some can be super cool even. I think most of it falls on how the owners raise, teach and treat them."
unpopularopinion,fhoxvni,t1_fhoxjay,1581777348.0,Yes noise during the day is a given that’s why I said it’s not because of the other noises. Your dogs should not be barking constantly all day long. I don’t care if you’re at work or not. It is not natural for dog to bark for hours and hours on end.  And as I said I know we all have jobs and lives but if you’re too busy to take care of your dog then don’t have one! Your dog shouldn’t be spending 95% of its time lonely and bored if you are a good responsible dog owner.
unpopularopinion,fhox257,t1_fhow89j,1581776646.0,"I’ve actually met dogs and owners that I like, but most can go to hell."
unpopularopinion,fhowy3i,t1_fhowc75,1581776546.0,I was using that comparison because most owners call their dogs their kids and I was proving that they don’t work the same and how ridiculous it is. So thanks for agreeing with me you fucking idiot. Have a nice day!
unpopularopinion,fhowr5w,t1_fhoweru,1581776376.0,Not really but they definitely don’t cause as much annoyances in my life.
