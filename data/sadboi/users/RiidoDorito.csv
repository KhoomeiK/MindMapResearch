Finishing up my Master's program. Will graduate in June. Was accepted into a Japanese school program set to begin in September. With the COVID-19 situation, they are putting classes online for the first quarter. They said they will decide at a later time if/when they transition to real life courses.

Sounds fine, right? Well, turns out the program is through the CULTURE visa and they cannot sponsor us until the courses are in person. So I will be visa-less after graduating. 

 I'm such a fucking idiot I hate myself and I don't know what to do. It's like... Is it even worth it? Should I brave the COVID-19 possibility and just go the fuck home and say screw it to the program? Or do I do the program, go home until they say to come back, and then move back home after finishing the program? Or do I rapid-fire apply to a bunch of random ass jobs to be like ""yes I am jobhunting gimme jobhunting visa please"" lol.
