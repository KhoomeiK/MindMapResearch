fasting,fow02mw,t1_fovz36y,1588110557.0,So you can confirm that drinking diet soda doesn’t interfere with autophagy? Because your opinion isn’t a confirmation.

SuicideWatch,fmk902q,t3_fvh3ch,1586147698.0,"This is exactly how my life is, only I didn’t know it until you just put it into words. I am in a constant state of “wtf am I going to do?”. Everyone has jobs or a passion that supports their life. Or at least ideas that they put their energy into, and will do that until they are successful. It seems like everyone else has it all figured out, and I’m just alone...broken. I’m 30. So thank you for this. 

Also the “ready to go” part made me actually lol, so thank you for that because I was just crying. It was funny to me because that’s how I feel. I think of killing myself often, and most of the time I’m not even sad. I’m just ready to go. Over it."

1: a guy was caught eating a girl out in the bathroom, which resulted in him being referred to as “Cat Man” probably until this day 🤔. I was in high school 03-07 lol

2. One of our coaches commuted suicide via shotgun in a cemetery. The story was that his wife found out he was having an affair with the drama teacher. Now that I’m an adult it’s possible a student made that up and we all ran with it."

dating_advice,fh7c3ym,t3_f1atlt,1581324120.0,"I’m not a guy, but I am am extreme introvert. I am home alone MOST of the time. I enjoy having space and being 100% comfortable. If I go to a guys house I will 99.9% of the time leave to go home. I can’t sleep. If I do end up staying most likely I’ll lie awake while they sleep, waiting until it’s a “normal” time to leave. I am not comfortable sleeping in other people’s beds, especially with them in it. It takes me a long while to get there. With that being said, I would prefer for people not to sleep at my house. I like the idea of waking up and being myself and being comfortable. I dread the thought of waking up having to put on that “We’re not close enough for me to be me without feeling awkward and somehow wrong” front. Even if I like/care about the person. Guys have been offended by this, but they don’t understand it has nothing to do with them. You should still ask him, but maybe that helps?"

Have you ever seen someone look or dress in such a way that you never would, but seem to be a people magnet? Very popular? It’s because they dress how they want and feel comfortable which makes them feel confident and THAT is what makes people attractive! As long as you own your look with confidence you will always be attractive. And not to everybody, nobody is attractive to everyone."
