Anxiety,fn7z731,t3_g02ffm,1586730603.0,"Ok this is gonna be a LONG comment because I‚Äôm like that too and I‚Äôve thought about this a lot. For me it used to be a lot more destructive than it is Now though. I straight up used to feel like life as like a non famous person would be just not worth living.

I think it‚Äôs important to keep a couple of things separate though. 

1. Being extremely successful and impactful in some field is probably No guarantee for happiness and fulfillment in life at all. Just take like an hour to go through the Wikipedia or Ranker.com lists of famous people who commited suicide, keeping in mind that the hundreds and hundreds of people on those lists represent only the smallest top of the iceberg of the most extreme cases of human anguish among people successful enough to at least have their own wiki page, which is more than most of us could hope for.

2. While being a famous and acclaimed person probably isn‚Äôt all it‚Äôs propped up to be, striving to acomplish something great or create something beautiful and achieving excellence in whatever field you choose can definitely be a very satisfying and meaningful thing to do. I think there is a genuine need in humans (some more than others) to create or be a part of something bigger than ourselves and not just be slaves to our most base desires all our lives and then die having lived pointless lives of being basically just selfish consumers of products instead of creators of beauty and impactors on the world around us. 

However I think that the satisfaction that comes from pushing yourself to achieve something that you value as great doesn‚Äôt actually come primarily from being acknowledged by others but by Knowing that you did something to the absolute best of your ability, something you deem beautiful or great and that you can be genuinely proud of and that you feel made the world a better place in some way, even in a small way.

A lot of the time we think of very successful people as being the ones that get to make great art, have successful buisinesses and live these purpose driven lives while a ‚Äùnormal‚Äù life is more or less, go to your boring job 9-5 and Watch Netflix in the evening. That feels pointless to a lot of us because it actually is pointless. But my point is that your non famous life doesn‚Äôt have to look like this ‚Äùnormal‚Äù life at all. You can work part time for food and rent and then spend all your other time trying to achieve whatever you dream of. 

Excellence isn‚Äôt only for some exclusive group of people, it‚Äôs open to anyone who‚Äôs willing to work for it at any age or stage in life and if you genuinely like the things that you create or do yourself it‚Äôs actually gonna matter a lot less what other people think of them or if you make a huge differens in the world."

Anxiety,fn60fmj,t1_fn5h2wk,1586682579.0,"I used to be like this pretty much all my life until I realized that it wasn‚Äôt really about the leisure time but about the time I spent doing ‚Äúproductive‚Äù things. 

There‚Äôs a rule that goes like this for me: If you never REALLY work, you can never REALLY rest.

Basically I was way too unstructured with anything I wanted to achieve. If I wanted to for example learn guitar I‚Äôd think something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna try to practice this song on guitar every day this week‚Äù. Then if I had a good week I‚Äôd actually do it but I‚Äôd sit for just as long as I felt like during the day and spend some of that time distracted on my phone or talking to someone etc etc. you know how it goes. While at the same time, I really did want to learn guitar and I‚Äôd go all the time with a vague feeling that I was wasting time and should be doing something else, even if I was playing every day. This was pretty much the same for everything, work, exercise, relationships, cleaning my apartment etc.

To me the solution is planing and structure. If I want to learn guitar Now I say something like: ‚ÄùIm gonna practice this song one hour every day from 5 to 6 after work and by next monday I want to have it down‚Äù then I put it into my phone calender and set a reminder. Then when it‚Äôs time to practice, that hour really is dedicated to practice. No distractions, no fiddling with the phone, one hour of real practice and then I‚Äôm done.

I do this for basically everything I decide I want to do Now. It may sound like doing this planing and practicing dicipline outside of work makes you some type of like dicipline and structure nazi but in the end It‚Äôs actually a lot less stressful than the constant gnawing feeling that you should be doing something else. Which is a type of stress.

And when you know that you‚Äôve done everything you set out to do during the day, worked 8-15, practiced guitar 16-17, went to get groceries 17:30 to 18:30 and called your friend you haven‚Äôt talked with for a while 19-19:30 then you‚Äôre actually done, you ACTUALLY have leisure time, and you can sit and watch a movie, take a long bath or just stare into a wall without feeling like you‚Äôre wasting time at all. 

Living like this has pretty much eliminated that feeling from my life. It also makes the hours you spend actually being productive more productive and the hours you spend actually relaxing more relaxing.

And remember: if you can‚Äôt get in everything you want to do into the planing of your day/week + time off for relaxation then you simply have too much to do and you need to prioritize, which is always difficult but necessary"

musictheory,fn4ac74,t3_fzguju,1586637290.0,"My biggest tip for learning theory in the beginning: get some type of keyboard and learn the notes on it. The cheapest 10$ toy keyboard vill do if it makes sounds.

I started learning theory on only guitar years ago with a professional teacher and I had huge problems understanding it in the beginning simply because, at least to me, a lot of even the simplest theory concepts are SO much less obvious on the fretboard than on a keyboard where all the notes in all the octaves are laid out clearly in front of you one after the other. When I‚Äôm studying a new theory concept I still always like to learn it on the keyboard and then apply it to guitar.

When you‚Äôve got your keyboard there are incredibly many videos on youtube on everything from the most basic to the most esoteric theory. And this sub of course!

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire‚Äôs flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It‚Äôs not desiring the fall; it‚Äôs terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt!‚Äô and ‚ÄòHang on!‚Äô, can understand the jump. Not really.

In TPK the workers who put themselves through deeply boring work sometimes get hallucinations where they‚Äôre visited by ‚Äùwraiths‚Äù that often represents suppressed parts of their personality but there are also real ghosts in the building that they sometimes see.

‚ÄùEvery love story is a ghost story‚Äù is part of one of the most excruciatingly boring chapters in TPK that directly describe the work on an average day at the office, the whole chapter is literally like this:

‚ÄùIrrelevant Chris fogle turns a page. Howard Cardwell turns a page. Ken wax turns a page. Matt Redgate turns a page. Bruce Channing attach√©s a form to a file. Ann williams turns a page. David Cusk turns a page.‚Äù Etc etc

The poetry of the sentence feels like a reward to the reader for sifting through the boring mass of the chapter in the same way the characters sift through tax documents for days to try to find an error.

‚ÄúYou feel these men with their photographs in magazines care deeply about having their photographs in magazines. Derive immense meaning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. They must. I would. Else why would I burn like this to feel as they feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe meaning they feel, you mean. From the fame.‚Äù

‚ÄúLyle, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù

‚ÄúLaMont, perhaps they did at first. The first photograph, the first magazine, the gratified surge, the seeing themselves as others see them, the hagiography of image, perhaps. Perhaps the first time: enjoyment. After that, do you trust me, trust me: they do not feel what you burn for. After the first surge, they care only that their photographs seem awkward or unflattering, or untrue, or that their privacy, this thing you burn to escape, what they call their privacy is being violated. Something changes. After the first photograph has been in a magazine, the famous men do not enjoy their photographs in magazines so much as they fear that their photographs will cease to appear in magazines. They are trapped, just as you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this supposed to be good news? This is awful news.‚Äù

‚ÄúLaMont, are you willing to listen to a Remark about what is true?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkey-dokey.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe truth will set you free. But not until it is finished with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I ought to be getting back.‚Äù

‚ÄúLaMont, the world is very old. You have been snared by something untrue. You are deluded. But this is good news. You have been snared by the delusion that envy has a reciprocal. You assume that there is a flip-side to your painful envy of Michael Chang: namely Michael Chang‚Äôs enjoyable feeling of being-envied-by-LaMont-Chu. No such animal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnimal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou burn with hunger for food that does not exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is good news?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is the truth. To be envied, admired, is not a feeling. Nor is fame a feeling. There are feelings associated with fame, but few of them are any more enjoyable than the feelings associated with envy of fame.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe burning doesn‚Äôt go away?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat fire dies when you feed it? It is not fame itself they wish to deny you here. Trust them. There is much fear in fame. Terrible and heavy fear to be pulled and held, carried. Perhaps they want only to keep it off you until you weigh enough to pull toward yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould I sound ungrateful if I said this doesn‚Äôt make me feel very much better at all?‚Äù

‚ÄúLaMont, the truth is that the world is incredibly, incredibly, unbelievably old. You suffer with the stunted desire caused by one of its oldest lies. Do not believe the photographs. Fame is not the exit from any cage.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I‚Äôm stuck in the cage from either side. Fame or tortured envy of fame. There‚Äôs no way out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou might consider how escape from a cage must surely require, foremost, awareness of the fact of the cage"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,f8gfi4t,t3_e0qmlu,1574558939.0,"So subjective and a lot of artists I love have shitty or boring named but I think a really good name should ideally:

1, Fit the type of music you‚Äôre making, like have the same ‚Äùfeel‚Äù to it as the music or add an extra layer that fits. Like I think ‚ÄùThe velvet underground‚Äù fits their music well or ‚ÄùRadiohead‚Äù or ‚ÄùJoy division‚Äù 

2. Be a bit interesting and stand out, I started listening to Andrew Jackson jihad just because of the name and now Am a fan, same with The shaolin afronauts and Godspeed you! black emperor

3. Roll off the tounge well. Especially difficult to combine with the ‚Äùbe interesting‚Äù part. ‚ÄùPost malone‚Äù ‚ÄùMONO‚Äù ‚ÄùFugazi‚Äù

4. Be non generic enough to be easily found if googled
