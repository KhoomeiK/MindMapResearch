BPD,fqim6ct,t3_giltnk,1589397852.0,"I dont disagree with you but the examples you used were way too vague.  Like for example threatening a break up if your partner doesn't come home, that could be completely reasonable in some circumstances, like being cheated on.  Plus, I don't think ""abuse"" and ""symptom of the disorder"" are mutually exclusive. Your post formats them that way.  I don't think its one versus the other.  If you're gonna wield the ""abuse"" sword I only ask you wield it carefully.

But let's get to the real issue here.  The ""venting"" flaired posts need to die already.  Its not even venting, its just people rationalizing their shitty behavior and then a bunch of BPD people go ""wow I wouldve done the same thing you go man""  Then the sub automod says ""OP is not seeking advice"" like wtf is that?  You're discouraged from offering the proper course of action via the automod.  Pure enabling.

You have to tread these forums cautiously because theres some people that just want to be ""validated"" which really just means ""enabled"""
AskReddit,fqbkywp,t3_ghnywe,1589238937.0,"On a physical level its exploiting the most powerful and important limbic dopamine response we have (reproduction), producing addiction-like behavior and warping the reproductive system to become sexually aroused to image and video files of a human rather than an actual human.  This can lead to the inability to become physically aroused to real sex.  As the dopamine response blunts, novelty-seeking behavior ensues to compensate, leading to fetishes that were never present before.

On a mental level it can damaging to the self esteem of viewers.  Artistic freedom is essential to any democratic government.  However, porn does its best to present an unrealistic narrative of sex (physically and behaviorally) which is the appeal.  There are unrealistic body types enhanced by camera tricks, the same kind of misrepresentation which is present in the modeling industry.  Since porn is so accessible now and visual tricks have advanced, young kids can come away with damaged self esteems, particularly young girls.

On a societal level it is probably the single biggest industry of women abuse.  Pornstars who talk highly of the industry usually worked at the top level, are massively over-represented in popular media, and work with a high amount of personal liberty and safety. Underrepresented is the ghastly porn underbelly of human trafficking, child exploitation, physical and mental abuse, and dangerous drug use.  None of this stuff is being shown in a porn video, very little of it is shown in the American media (capitalism chases the $$$ above all)."
BPD,fpzax6u,t3_gfyltf,1589015840.0,"Thanks for saying this.  

Just went through a terrible terrible night.  Probably nearly killed myself with the amount of alcohol I drank plus I took some other shit.  Stress of school got to me, I just had finals.  Apparently I texted my ex asking for a ride to the doc, in super misspelled words, and she responded ""I dont know why youre pretending youre like this, just talk normally"" and ""its over""

I get that no one seeks out to be party to my toxic shit.  But like fuck bro, if you dont wanna give me a ride just ignore me.  Dont tell me I'm making shit up.  But there you go, shes my ex, thats why.  Shits so insulting.  Its fucked.  I know it's fucked.  I shouldn't do it.  But its not manipulative.  I needed a damn ride and this girl acts like I want her back and shit, like I devised this to make her feel bad for some greater motive like dating her again.

I just ask myself like what does she think is happening when I do this?  They must think I have a script, fake puke in my mouth, a green screen, CGI-rendered pills, whatever the fuck.  Its like the stupidest shit.  When I was little and I would watch action movies, I would get so scared and my dad used to have to constantly tell me it was all Hollywood magic.  Now everyone watches too much Netflix it feels like Im telling people that my life ISNT Hollywood magic.  lmao.

Thats my fault though bruh.  They always tell me splitting is bad and toxic, and it for sure is.  But not many people talk about how that idealization shit is toxic too.  I love-bombed the shit out of this girl back in the day, now her genius theory is that I fake shit like this for some of that coochie.  Dont idealize.  Power corrupts."

BPD,fokmxcj,t3_g7zys3,1587845073.0,"Try not to have endless debates with yourself about the situation.  Try not to replay the situation in your head a million times.  simply:

1. Identify your emotions.  Say to yourself that it's okay to feel the way you feel.  Too often those with BPD think they're supposed to pretend like their emotions don't or shouldn't exist.

2. Remind yourself that you love yourself and you and a being worthy of the love you have for yourself.  This is fundamentally important.

3. Realize your internal struggle is damaging to yourself.  (""I feel achey already, so sad and worthless because of it"")

4. Realize that this damage does not need to be done to someone you love (yourself).  Think about the great things about you.  Out of your newly-realized self love, let your conflict breeze past you.  Let the love for yourself overcome it.



When a non-BPD person interacts with a BPD person in a state of strong emotion, they will often say ""thats not how youre supposed to feel"" or something to that effect.  Emotions are neither right nor wrong, they're just emotions.  Your goal should be to avoid the shame that comes with constantly believing you're feeling the wrong thing."

In other words, think about the emotion you're feeling and if you'll still be feeling it in an hour, two hours, twelve hours, etc.

DONT beat yourself up for feeling what you feel.  Remember your mission here is to love yourself and be on your own team. The stress and anguish of the issue is harming you, especially if it is something that will pass.

I watched all my friends grow up to get great jobs and make lots of money while I grew up fighting BPD and trying to stay alive, trying to stop cutting, trying to kick a pill addiction.  If I compare myself to them, of course my life seems ruined.  Is it even close, their achievements and mine?

But in reality I am simply on a different path.  They didn't walk right into a successful life just because they didn't have BPD.  Life is hard for them too.  Life is always hard, it finds a way to be hard for everyone.

They fight, and so do I.  I respect them because they fight.  I don't have my life together like they do, and they've seen me at my worst, my most pathetic, when I feel like I'm worthy of no respect.

But they still respect me in those moments and they feel honored to be my friend, because they know I fight this with every bone in my body.  That is my path in life.  My path and your path.

Lets examine this.  Are you ruining your own life? What is ruining a life? Because youre having episodes related to BPD?  Maybe you feel that way because others dont do what you do, but youre on a different path.  In all likelihood youre stronger than them.  You are a strong human being.  If your life is so totally ruined then why are you here seeking help? It's because your power is pushing back against your illness.  You refused to give up.  You're worthy of immense respect.

The projector was big enough so that the thumbnails were quite large, and we could clearly see that a few of the image files were a naked girl.  

That's not all, the naked girl was clearly a girl from the literal class he was in.  And she didn't even give him the nudes, she apparently sent them to another guy who secretly sent them to this kid.

So she ended up crying like the entire day but the silver lining was everyone was pretty much on her side and she didn't get bullied or harassed.  Everyone had her back.  This happened around maybe 2013 so it definitely could've gone the other way.

I went to a really really wealthy private high school and the a lot of the kids were the offspring of rich influential people in my city.  Kim Kardashian even showed up to one of the sweet-16 parties that year..  I think the kids dad pulled some strings around and avoided making it a police matter.

Obviously I cant prove that.  But he ended up just getting expelled when IMO he should've caught a case.  If he did catch a case he got off with a slap on the wrist, all that happened was he went to public school.

After a couple minutes the owner comes out angry as hell, looks like he wants to take my head off.  I explained to him the situation, paid the bill and tipped him, we left.
