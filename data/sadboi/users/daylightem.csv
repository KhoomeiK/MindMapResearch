The one that got away two years ago messaged me, and wanted to reconnect. This was after i had the feeling I’d be hearing from him- which makes no sense as I hadn’t heard from him in nearly two years. But then I dreamed about him! Can’t remember what it was about though. And then! A mutual friend whom I lost during the fall out of that summer love, refollowed me on Instagram, before old love reached out...

  Any body else would be easy to chat, and then move on. This guy has never left my mind, and i worry he never will. It’s so easy to fall into conversation with him, but it complicated an already kinda confusing situation with my boyfriend. 

I told old love that I can’t talk to him bc it makes it hard for me to figure out the situation in front of me. When I first met old love I was in a stagnant relationship then too. He triggered the break up, but we never became anything due to other circumstances and we went no contact for nearly two years. Now I feel like I’m in a similar place (stagnant relationship, confused about my next step) and he pops up again... I don’t know if it’s a reminder to keep an eye on the prize in front of me and not get distracted by shiny new toys, or if it’s a reminder of the spark that’s possible..."

We had the federalist and anti federalists, the Whig party, the anti-Masonic... parties change and evolve all the time. So those racist southern democrats? They’d vote republican these days.

AstrologyChartShare,fml4sfc,t1_fml422v,1586178597.0,"You know what, I think the fact that you prefer others to take the lead and frame “”””yourself””” based on who you’re with would lead to your cancer rising and could be why certain placements are off putting! Cancers and I have a tough time (I’m an Aries) because I lack tact/come across rude and they are hyper sensitive to this. 

Might also be why you have a hard time when your boundaries aren’t respected because you likely wouldn’t think twice of doing it to them."
ENFP,fml4fds,t1_fml3wb0,1586178330.0,"I also have anxiety and I understand how hard it can be to not take other people’s actions super personal- but you have to remember each person is living in their own world just like you are. Something that helps me is realizing I’m not the center of the world. People aren’t always judging Me, if they are rude it could be another thing in their life causing it, if they don’t respond, they’re probably busy, etc."
