Coincidentally I had a big trauma week also so that could be more issues than the Abilify.

The good news is I feel clear-headed, able to finish a project, think logically and not collapse into  depression every day. Plus life brings me pleasure.

So,  I upped my Lamotrigine which I had been tapering off of.   If I am hypo,  it is not worth the trade off of falling down into depression later.
