I'm only lucky in that I live within walking distance of the Amtrak in Davis and used to live that close to the one in Sac."
Sacramento,f30sfz7,t3_df2jo7,1570561422.0,"this has probably been said in the comments a few times, but I think this has a lot to do with how awful our public transit systems are. 
i can't drive, and I don't own a car, so I'm either using public transit or paying friends for rides. 
To get from downtown Sacramento to downtown Davis, its 20 minutes by car or 1.5-2 hours by bus. It can take up to 3 hours if you're going to say, Arden from Davis. This means that any time I need to travel, even within the county, I am spending at most 6 hours in transit whereas someone in a car is spending 40 minutes. So instead, we bite the bullet and pay for an Uber (if you're poor, like I am, this is pretty rare) or we give friends a few bucks for a ride. either way it puts more cars on the road, and creates more congestion."

I gave myself alcohol poisoning multiple times. one night, I was delusional again and decided to just. start smashing my head into the ground.
