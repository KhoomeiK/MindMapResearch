BipolarReddit,fr6n8r0,t3_gmx2pq,1589929395.0,"I’ll preface this by saying I’ve historically had a fantastic memory. I was an A student for 18 years of formal schooling, and I never had to study because I retained everything from lectures and classes. I tend to remember every little detail of every thing that’s ever happened. Except when I’m having an episode. My last manic episode pre-medication I literally had to keep a note on my phone where I’d record things as they were happening because I knew I wouldn’t remember them. Even for huge life events. I’m on 400mg Lamictal and I don’t think the medication is having a separate negative impact on my memory but I do still get brain fog for the day-to-day stuff. If I’m not totally stable, I’ll find myself asking my boss a question and forgetting the answer by the time I get back to my desk. Or I’ll wake up and have no recollection of what time I went to bed and what I did in the last hour or two before I started to sleep. But I can remember details that don’t matter, like the outfit I was wearing the day I became aware of my memory loss three years ago. Brains are weird."

You won’t know right away what the right dose is for you because it takes time to build up in your system and because sometimes you don’t know if periods of stability are due to the meds or if you’re just not currently in an episode.

I was an absolute wreck before starting it, but now that I’ve tapered up to the max dose I’m a lot more functional. I do still have episodes but they’re less severe than before. My old doctor basically said that was good enough, but I started with a new doctor today who said most people with significant bipolar symptoms should probably be on at least two medications to achieve maximum benefit, so you may still need to take something else.

She would open the window and literally scream at us on Saturday afternoons telling us to shut up so she could do her work. My mom went over one day and told her she shouldn’t expect silence when she lives at the end of a street where multiple kids live, and she should go to the library. She stopped screaming but she found other ways to fuck with us. She would come into my friend’s backyard while we were on the swing set and yell at us for walking through her yard (even though we had never set foot on her property). Once she accused us of staring in her windows, and even though I was in my own yard and wasn’t looking at her house, she still threatened to call the cops because we had supposedly violated her privacy.

It’s a really tricky condition to diagnose because the symptoms overlap so much with so many other conditions. When I was in my first major manic episode, I didn’t know what was wrong with me, but I couldn’t pay attention to my schoolwork for more than 10 seconds so I went to the counseling center figuring I just had ADHD and anxiety.
