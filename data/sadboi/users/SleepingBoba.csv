I feel like have a group of people rely on my consistent participation is what has kept me going. We only meet once a week. I made sure to wait a while before ordering any materials for myself. The group let me borrow books, minis, dice when I needed them. But now I have something that actually allows me to delve into side hobbies while still having something to focus on. I love sketching and painting, but I will be artsy for a couple weeks and then get bored. So now, instead of having all these random sketches, I've got tons of character drawings. And I can paint minis and they will be useful later. 
I can do research on norse mythology and use this new completely random and unnecessary but totally interesting information to build a new character. 
I can make/buy things for props to use in-game.

I think finding a hobby that allowed me to pursue all the side interests that my brain is naturally drawn to, but can't commit long term, while still being useful is what has kept me going."

Mommit,eztjl7v,t3_d2815v,1568131841.0,"Ok. I get where you are coming from. I had very similar issues with my in laws. They know everything, they have opinions on everything, my MIL is was very close to my husband and seemed to want to take over the mom role when I was still learning with my first. 

What I learned is to be direct. If anyone makes comments I don't think are appropriate, they get called out there and then. I refused to let things continue to when my kids got to an age where they actually understood what my MIL was saying. I don't care if it's coming from a good place or if it's a joke. If I think it's something that will be an issue in the future, it got shot down. 

My MIL also would come up and just take my baby from my arms. That happened a couple of times before I just turned away from her and told her she needed to ask. She got a bit offended. I didn't care. My baby, my rules.  

As far as the clothes go, I mostly let that slide. I didn't particularly care for the outfits  my MIL would buy my daughter, but if I didn't have to put her in those clothes if my MIL wasn't around. When they would visit, if my daughter needed a change of clothes, my MIL would volunteer to get her cleaned up and my daughter would come out in crazy outfits, but hey, I didn't have to clean up the blow out and vomit... seemed like a fair trade.  Now my daughter is 6 and my MIL has figured out that if my daughter doesn't like what she is given, she's not going to wear it. So she is always asked for style approval.  So at least now, I don't have to store ridiculously gaudy outfits anymore. 

My MIL and I get along for the most part now.  But it's definitely taken time and work.  

TLDR: stand up for what you don't approve of. Tell your MIL what's ok and what's not. But hopefully, some things are just a phase."

adhdwomen,eywmiu8,t3_cz7vv9,1567532911.0,"I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old. I've lost the battle many times. They have a play room and their bedrooms full of toys. I went thru all they toys and got rid of the baby ones when my youngest started demanding to play with his big sister's toys. Maybe when he turned 3. 

I also refuse to buy toys that are part of a set with tons of pieces anymore. I've gotten rid of most of these because we lose pieces so frequently. I've had to tell family members not to buy certain things, but it makes cleaning and organizing so much easier. 

Legos/duplos all get put together. I don't care about the sets. My kids don't care about the sets. My husband does. So if he has an issue, he has to deal with it. If he doesn't help my oldest with how to organize the sets off legos they get put in the same box with all the other ones. We save the instructions so they can be remade. But I don't have time to dust all the sets and keep them all pretty and put together. And my kids aren't gonna do it. So oh well. 

I know it sounds harsh not getting all the little jewelry kits or the little hot wheels race tracks but I'm the one that ends up having to clean up after the kids. Im just done with that.

My son has his trucks, dinosaurs, and the duplos. We have boxes/buckets for each. He plays with them all over the place and then they all go back in the buckets. My daughter has horses, books, stuffies, and art supplies. She has a bookshelf, she's got buckets for her toys. They go back up when she's done. And I'm about to get rid of the toys in the playroom because they rarely even go in there. 

I think that as parents, when we first had our daughter, we thought she needed something new for every stage in her development, and then multiple options. Then we had another kid, he needed more things and now he likes different things. But I've been taking things out of their rooms to get rid of clutter for a while and they don't even notice. They are happy with whatever they have in front of them. If I take away a few things, they still have plenty left."
adhd_anxiety,eyiu6sp,t1_eyirjud,1567107676.0,"It's definitely been a work in progress. And I still have trouble keeping up. But I try to break things down as much as possible so can see more check marks. They're my very favorite work thing to do. I will also add in more info inside the bubbles, so those long winded tasks probably got written out over a few days. If the task still needs more work, I'll check off that one when it's done with the small steps inside and make a new one with the main task as the start and add new little notes in the clouds. 

Sometimes I feel like that's what my brain is actually working with. Clouds that it hops to whenever something interesting pops up. üí≠üí≠üí≠

P.S. phone calls are the worst... everything should be done by email at this point. But when I need to make a phone call, I'll write down as much as I can and then reformat into my bubbles later. The key for me is to make sure I'm not just writing a novel of words. I have to keep write in sections based on what is said. Then that's where my bubbles come in."

Keto_Food,eyi36g1,t1_eyfaj0v,1567096922.0,"This is so me. The recipe I found was a full cup of cheese to 2 eggs. So this should have been fine. I did cheddar cheese too. My problem though was that I poured the entire mixture into my standard waffle maker and it all splooshed out the sides. I figured since it was a mini chaffle recipe for 2 individual chaffles, I would be fine with the whole mixture in the big waffle maker. I was wrong. 

I'd definitely try the cooking spray next time. The extra cheese shouldn't have mattered since that would have just added more oil once it started cooking. 
I would guess maybe the whole iron wasn't hot enough for it to be on that long and not cook all the way thru. Did it start steaming out the sides before you opened it?"

It's pretty basic. I do like to decorate when I'm gathering my thoughts on things. But each bubble is a different task and has its own checkbox.

If I've got a bigger design going on, that will get its own separate checklist and then each item that is specifically for the design goes on that page."
adhd_anxiety,eyfj8ij,t1_eyfc99n,1567049640.0,"Oh yeah! I could definitely see how that could get overwhelming. Sometimes I'll have days when I forget to keep track of tasks that pop up (gotta keep the suppliers questions at high priority so we don't slip schedule) I start getting behind on other things, then go back thru all my email and add everything. After I get everything written down, bubbles, and with the all important checkbox, my brain settles and I can catch back up."
adhd_anxiety,eyfbur4,t3_cwpvpe,1567046426.0,"Oooh! I can answer this one! I'm an engineer. I get so overwhelmed when I get tasked to start a new design I will put it off until I finish every other smaller simple task. Eventually I will be asked for a status report on the new design and have to come up with excuses as to why im not further along. Now, usually it's ok because I've gotten every other task on my to do list completed, but my lead is still questioning why I've done so little on this new big thing. 

I've really been working to do better at these kinds of issues. I really dislike this side of my brain that just can not seem to function even I know it's important and complicated. So, I've started making checklists. For Everything. My small/simple tasks, but also the main big design. Then I'll have another task list for that big design. Break it out into smaller sections. If those are still semi big items, they get task lists too! It is seriously working! Ive never been so organized. I've saved all my lists so I can go back and see all I've accomplished. I've got a whole binder of task lists. The smaller i can break up the chunks of a new design, the less anxiety I have, and the more work I actually get done.  And eventually, as I finish the smaller lists for each larger task, I start making actual, definable progress on this big complicated design!

I will also mention, the key for me is adding little cloud bubbles around each task. I can't do just the boring line by line list. My brain needs something extra and the cloud bubbles seem to do the trick. Also, I need an actual box to check off in each bubble. If I don't visibly check off a tank, I will read it over and over again. I start from the top every time I pick up my paper and go one by one. I'd the box is checked, I mentally don't even see that cloud bubble anymore. 

I don't know if you got this far. I know it's a lot of rambling. But the checklists work."

I play attention to everything. All the time. Some steps are bound to be missed.
