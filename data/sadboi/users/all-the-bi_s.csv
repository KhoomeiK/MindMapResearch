UnresolvedMysteries,fn0sdu3,t3_fy9tog,1586547836.0,The sodder children case. There's too many variables and why didn't they find any bones of the children in the ashes? Everything is fishy! I wonder if they really are still alive. Even the cause of the fire is still suspicious. Definitely think its arson and I wonder what happened to those kids? All the planted evidence. I don't think it'd be solved unless the kids are still alive and come forward.
AskReddit,fn0g2qf,t3_fyccd5,1586541286.0,I'm bisexual and mormon. Church has always been a big part of my life. It's really hard because the church says lgbt people are not going to be shut away from god but lgbt aren't allowed to act romantically and sexually as a LGBT person. Only my mom knows I'm bi not the rest of my family. I currently live with my aunt and uncle they cant know because I think they'd kick me out. I took an lgbt studies course for a college elective and I mentioned it to my uncle. He kept badgering me to read the book of mormon and the family proclamation from the prophet (famil proclamation is basically about how families are a husband and wife etc.). So that way I won't be tempted. I'm torn I've normally loved my church but I don't agree on some of the things they've said. My mom always says it's okay to disagree no ones asking me to follow blindly. I still believe in the basics of my church. I have become less active but at my core I still believe. I think my church is wrong about lgbt identities. I know God and Jesus love me regardless and always will. I always try to keep that in mind and it brings me peace.
