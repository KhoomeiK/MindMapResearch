I lost both of my jobs and don’t qualify for unemployment as I’m a 1099 W2 hybrid. I didn’t make enough with my w2 job to qualify for unemployment and the PUA disqualifies you if you have income from w2. I’m utilizing as many local resources as I can. 

I grew up homeless/shelter insecure so I don’t have any family support. I worked two jobs to put myself through undergrad. Before attending graduate I got really sick and ended up having to live out of my car in between hospitalizations.
I was diagnosed with lupus and have spent the last two years working through chronic illness. Right before covid I was finally able to get myself into stable housing. I’m really afraid I’m going to get this virus. I went into septic shock from the flu the last time I got that. I’m really grateful for everyone who is staying home right now.
Thanks for the chance. I greatly appreciate it!

I live with lupus. I unfortunately don’t have any family support. I worked two jobs to put myself through school. I got very ill right before attending graduate school. I had to forgo grad school while I lived in my car sick and trying to make student loan payments. I’ve spent two years working through chronic illness and right before covid things were looking up. Now I’ve lost both of my jobs and I’m absolutely terrified I’m going to get sick again. I finally have safe housing with a bed. I’m doing everything I can to make sure I don’t lose this.

I’ve noticed when I’m in a relationship I get a lot less unwanted attention. Amazing to me that people will “respect” me more if I’m someone else’s “property.” I’m definitely going to be signing up for some sort of boxing as well. It would be really nice to feel like I have some power. But I should definitely figure out how to use my words first like “excuse me.” I guess I don’t really say that now because I’m genuinely concerned they would become more aggressive.

Years of abuse and I guess I’m still holding onto that “they didn’t mean it” or “they struggled through their own abuse.”

There are also outlines and reviews of the book that summarizes the information. Maybe that would be okay to read without inducing as much rage? Of course you don’t have to read the book right now. This can be something you come back to further down your healing.

Edit: a word"
CPTSD,fndnl1a,t1_fndg723,1586873919.0,"Thanks so much for asking! I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. I tried to get through it for a few years but I would always end up crying. I signed up for a free trial of audible, though my local library does have a audiobook copy it was just on hold for months. I flew through it! I still ended up crying. And I imagine you may still fill with rage. I wouldn’t push yourself. If a particular chapter feels overwhelming it’s okay to stop.

You could also still try to read it and when you notice yourself fill with rage try to notice that rage. You don’t need to control it. Just notice it. And maybe then trying a grounding technique, if you’ve found them helpful before. I would recommend having lots of compassion for yourself. Know that what happened to you wasn’t your fault and your body is doing everything it can to protect itself, like filling with rage. I think is amazing our body works hard to protect themselves. Even if it is maladaptive in the moment.

Hopefully more people will keep suggesting ideas. Feel free to message me if you ever need anything!"

I recently got out of a very long abusive relationship that was basically quarantining for years.
