insaneparents,fi45yf7,t1_fi3uhq7,1582134635.0,"My father was smoking meth from when I was about 8 until about 21, so about 12ish years. At 17 I finally disowned him/went NC after a pretty bad fight where a lot of things were said that really got to me. I decided about 3 years later to call him on his birthday because I missed him and found out that he had been clean for about 6 months and taking court ordered UA’s once a week. He’s been clean for almost 10 years now with no relapses and I couldn’t be happier to have my dad back to who he was when I was a kid. I know the pain and anger of finding out your parent is doing something that horrible and I feel for you completely. I hope someday that things get better for you and you may be able to have your mother back. Stay strong and don’t let her fuck ups bring you down! ❤️"

Denver,fhucvcu,t3_f41w55,1581884908.0,"This makes me so angry. I’ve owned two pit bulls in the last 6 years. One I got as a 6 week old puppy (recently lost him) and the other is technically my boyfriends (rescued at 10 months, used as a bait dog, teeth filed down, pretty horrible situation.) Both of them have honestly been the best dogs I have ever met in my life. Both were registered as emotional support animals for me for major depressive disorder and major anxiety and have helped me immensely. Neither have ever showed any signs of aggression towards any human or animal. It’s ridiculous to ban an entire breed based off of a few incidents, especially when they have been proven to be less aggressive than other breeds that have never been considered for banning. Luckily, I live in Westminster now, and I will never consider living in Denver again because of this. BSL is complete bullshit."

You greasy bastard!” Without missing a beat, my daughter who was sitting at the table and playing on her tablet says back to him “No! You’re a greasy bastard!” He and I both had to control ourselves and not start laughing immediately and explain to her that we don’t call people bastards and we would prefer she didn’t use that word yet. After we got her focused back on her tablet we both sat on the floor and laughed until we had tears in our eyes. I love being a parent for many reasons but situations like that are a top 10 reason why I love it."

Kids that age do get into everything but as a parent, it is your job to be watching them like a hawk, especially in someone else’s home, regardless if it is your parents home or not. If I was your sister, I would absolutely take you to small claims court to teach you a lesson in taking responsibility for your own fuck-ups..."
