AskReddit,f627tjp,t3_c00es4,1572654675.0,"I attempted suicide 4 times but failed. This just come to my own realization that my life is so precious and it seems that “fate” has given me a chance to just get back up and think of your depression as a motivation (for lack of a better term). You are not your feelings and you’re not controlled by your feelings; you’re in control of that and who you want to be. I don’t think there is a way to “beat” it but integrate it into making a better version of yourself. You’re not alone even if it think it is. I was just stressing my life in just beating depression but I have realized that I’m myself. I guess you just have to realize that life has many paths and there’s always a plan B when something’s wrong. Don’t let your friends fuck around with you and if they joke about it, fuck them. They can’t do shit with your feelings unless you embrace it like accepting a devil knocking the door to your heart. I’m not loved and unpopular. However that didn’t stop me from investing my own time in training my mind and reshaping myself and start to embrace my depression instead of fighting it. Depression is not an easy topic to talk about and there’s no easy way out of it but you’ll find your way out of that maze if you’re determined to do so."
