Women were generally not nearly as hateful as men about it but did ask rather invasive questions (I’m queer, so I always had my settings set to “everybody.”) Anyone who was on the trans spectrum was totally cool about it and used my pronouns correctly and vice versa.

My now-fiancé is a cis male and considered himself heterosexual before we started seeing each other. We’ve been friends since we were 13 (I’m 29), so he knew I was NB and he simply had some innocuous and innocent questions about it, which he asked once he had a couple of glasses of wine in him. They were not offensive questions at all and he was basically just like “okay, cool. So because I’m attracted to you, would that mean I’m not straight?”

I said “well, kindasorta yeah, because I don’t identify as female.” He said “okay, cool! Guess I’m a little queer then.”

He’s definitely an exception to the rule as far as I’ve experienced, but there are people like him out there. People commonly either don’t take it seriously and misgender you constantly or they don’t wanna date “a tranny (one of the slurs I’ve been called countless times.)”"

It helped me to notice what aspects of my mood tend to exist simultaneously and when I switch it throughout the day and notice I’m getting too elevated, I can take preventative measures like switching to decaf, taking a klonopin or two, doing a quick meditation, eating, etc. When I have a moderately-severely depressed day, I check my notes to see if anything could have happened to negatively affect my mood or if it is simply chemical.

I never intended to be alive at 28, I’m not really sure how I made it here. I went on and off meds throughout adulthood and at my worst I was a living mixed episode and tried to hang myself. That was in June of 2017 and my mom begged me to go back to treatment. I made the appointment and the first thing my dr put me on was Latuda.

Holy shit, you know in the Wizard of Oz when Dorothy steps out of her black and white house into Munchkinland? That’s what happened. It took less than a week. The intrusive “kill yourself this way!” “Drive into that tree!” thoughts that had been plaguing me for 15 years were just... gone. I started performing better at work, stopped sleeping all the time, ate like a normal person and actually had real energy.

Since then there have been some ups and downs, and medications added. I currently take 160mg of Latuda, 800mg of Gabapentin 3x a day, 3mg Klonopin at night and 30mg Adderall in the morning/15 in the afternoon. 

I also got sober, got out of an emotionally abusive relationship, have avoided dating altogether, eat a healthy diet and rediscovered a lot of my old hobbies. I haven’t had a serious episode (by serious I mean hospitalization-worthy) in about a year and a half. I’ve experienced moderate and (rarely) severe depression and hypomania at times, but most days I’m a 5 or 6 out of 10 and feel what I think most people would consider to be “fine.” I have normal human reactions to sad or traumatic events and my mood spectrum has shrunk significantly. I’ve managed to keep a job for 2 and a half years now and even get promoted there, and I make a decent living and share a nice apartment with a roommate.

It’s not all unicorns and rainbows. I’m a songwriter and I do get frustrated when what used to be effortless creativity just doesn’t want to come out to play. I get frustrated by my lack of passion and excitement and muted feelings in general and have “I hate being on meds” moments, but I can’t imagine what my life would be like, or if I would even be here, had I not gone back to treatment."

I covered everything electronic with a screen, turned off my phone and hid it, dead bolted all of the doors and paced around the kitchen with a butcher’s knife. 

I also get the more common, milder (to me) ones like “bugs in your skin”, hearing voices, seeing shadow people, etc. but usually if one of those things happens I’m self-aware enough at this point to be like “ok you need to be sedated and supervised,” so I’ll medicate myself, call my roommate, and just try to lie down with some gentle music playing while continuing to tell myself that it isn’t real, call my mom if I need confirmation that there aren’t cockroaches in my arms.
