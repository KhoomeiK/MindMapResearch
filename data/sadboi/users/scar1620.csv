When I first told him I burst into tears. It’s a lot of emotions. But Doctors have seen it all. It’s their job to incorporate the info you give them into the best health plan for you. If they are making you feel uncomfortable about the subject you can always find a new PCP too not all doctors are the same."

I’m happy to have depression on my record in case I ever need assistance, have a problem with work, or need to go on disability if I couldn’t work. Protect yourself and know that no matter what happens you will make it through. So many Americans are on antidepressants and in therapy it hardly has the stigma it used to."
