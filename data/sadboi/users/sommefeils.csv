In my experience, bisexual or 'queer' women who say they hate men while expressing faux-positivity to other women are the most (male) attention-seeking, horny for the D creatures on earth. I don't follow any on Twitter, but I occasionally go down a rabbit hole from seeing another person's tweet and I'll find these girls who simultaneously hate themselves and think they're god's gift to earth, which is an intolerable combination to find in either sex. These girls are so desperate for male attention, which is FINE, but they also denegrate men for shitty, petty reasons that is just.. WTF? Like yeah, you hate men so much, that's why you send them selfies and have an onlyfans account. I really hate girls who have adopted being queer and hating men as their personality. 

It's okay to like guys, but when bi women behave as if it is very queer and cool of them to be kind to women and shitty to men, it just makes me think they are sheep who would just as quickly treat women like shit if that gained them any points in their specific social group."

truelesbians,fim4evt,t1_fiizlxp,1582517860.0,"It 's sad that other people still have to live in a culture that blatantly does not care about female individuality. I grew up in a Western culture, but I'm of east Asian background and was raised Catholic. I don't know if it's a competitive feeling - I'm not very feminine, but I do feel scared of other women, even if I'm not attracted to them. It's the potential social rejection? And with male friends, I find it easier to let my guard down and be natural because I don't care if they reject me socially, so I just have fun. 

Thank you for sharing your experience and for the advice. Currently working on being a whole-r person. I tried expanding my socializing (with women) in 2019 and I feel like I got exactly the same results, and that is what was so horrifying. Before, I was ruining an intimate friendship every 2-3 years. Since I made more friends, it was a very quick succession of ruined friendships because of my toxic behaviour."

The reason is that there are an overwhelmingly number of works of fiction that have these charming, egotistical male psychopaths that audiences either identify with or fall in love with, and psychoanalyze the hell out of. I say this as someone who has watched many shows with a male serial killer as the anti-hero/protagonist. I think KE carved out something that has never been seen before in television. (Please correct me if I'm wrong) 

I love this show and one of the reasons is because of its unapologetic focus on female psychology, psychopathy, and darkness. Also, Jodie Comer. If a family member is introduced for a season-long arc, fellow psychopath or not, I really hope it's a female character."
