AskReddit,fitld01,t3_f9kd1v,1582723390.0,"When I had a double whammy of dysentery and cymplobacter at the same time. Woke up one day with the most horrific pain I have ever experienced in my life in my stomach, couldnt move out of bed for 6 hours. 

Went to a doctor the day after to an A&E department as the pain was still very much ongoing as well as me shitting out blood, they said there was nothing wrong and it was probably a little bug.

Went twice after that and they said the same thing, I wasnt eating at all for this time as I couldnt keep down any food, literally a slice of bread a day and a lucozade sports bottle is all I could manage. The pain was horrific daily, i couldnt even function or even walk that much.

Finally 3 WEEKS into this they did a stool sample after me constantly telling them this wasnt just a fucking bug and having lost 2 stone. 

I was on the verge of fucking death and luckily my friend came to the city i was in ( im a student), brought me back home, They saw i had these infections and STILL didnt take me that seriously, discharging me from a hospital when I tried going again when I got back to my hometown. my family brought me to a hospital again after that and made sure they wouldnt discharge me.

I was in there for a week, first night I got home before I was finally admitted I seriously was scared to go to sleep in case I wasnt going to wake back up, I barely even had the energy to speak let alone raise a hand. I was even seeing flashing bright lights in my vision. At the age of 19.

Was scary shit, took me a week to even walk again after i was discharged and months to fully recover."

I wish I could just quit this, but it's all on me to do well and succeed for my family. My great nans dying wish was for me to succeed in London and do well in my degree, my mother right now and my family is very poor back home, my mother isn't even eating some days and it's all on me to do well and get wealthy and then get a better life for my family. It's all so stressful, I'm literally losing my hair already from all of this. I don't have a choice morally. I need to stay here and succeed, especially for finance. No other city bar London is worth speaking in the UK for finance. I need to tough it out here, it's my only option other than suicide.

I need my family to be happy, and then me to be happy and maybe be with someone and live a nice life, financially secure and maybe have a house. That to me is satisfaction."

However I had been up for about a day and a half at that point and hadn't eaten, I had no energy. So instead in a desperate attempt as I wanted it to end right that moment, i took all fhe medication i had in my room. Which amounted to about 12 sertraline pills and 4 paracetamol.
