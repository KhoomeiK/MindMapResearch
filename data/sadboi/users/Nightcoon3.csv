Your name is kinda racist, but you made it far too early to know that. And now it’s everywhere, and that’s okay. 

You’ve quite literally given yourself a timecap on your life, 10 years till you reach 30 and you’ve  decided life just ain’t worth it no more after that. In a year it’ll be nine, and soon it’ll be closer than you’re comfortable with. 

Try to prove yourself wrong. Please try. It doesn’t have to be an inevitability. You know there is joy somewhere out there, you just can’t see it yet. You might figure out how to pull back the curtain any day now and see it. 

That being said if you reach 30 and haven’t found it yet, end your life without hesitation. The output just isn’t worth the input at that point. 

Goodluck"
