Has it occurred to you that maybe... maybe these short-sighted attempts to reduce the tax burden of the corporate class by cutting important programs is a really, really dumb thing to do?

Don't you think that maybe, had Republicans supported the CDC in China, the outbreak could have been detected sooner, and thus handled better? I think the obvious answer is yes.

But that's not what happens when you have CEOs and lobbyist Republicans running the show. What happens is you have people whose only goal is to reduce the tax burden for big corporations.

I would think online, most guys want to get laid. I'm one of them. I dunno what else to say other than that's my preference, but I respect other peoples' wishes and I try to communicate and be up front with people about everything.

Maybe I'm a special snowflake or maybe not... but for me personally... I'm not opposed to a relationship if someone turns out to be particularly special. I'm not opposed to hookups either. I guess you just gotta communicate well about what you want or don't want.

I find myself struggling at times to explain this as well, I feel like I share some of your frustration, but in the opposite end of the spectrum, lol.

Women seem to want a committed relationship from the get go, but I want to take my time, see how things go, be intimate, and say farewell if there's no chemistry developing.

I want to get a feel for a person personality-wise if I'm going to commit. I need something compelling me to stay if I'm going to stay. Good company, maybe some intellectual conversation, something like that.

From my personal perspective, I think it's weird to ask for commitment without having spent a good amount of time together. I think it's okay to ask for exclusivity right away, but commitment so soon isn't what I'm after. That's my preference anyway, maybe you want commitment right away and maybe you can find a guy looking for the same thing.

I think the relationship/commitment talk can spook a person, especially if there hasn't been enough time to see if there's chemistry, but that's me I guess.

Sorry for the long ramble, hopefully that was helpful in some way. Just thought I'd share my 2 cents.

I felt useless, as if I wasn't contributing anything. I felt like I was just wasting time, getting paid a lot of money to contribute very little. I browsed reddit all day. I worked there for a year and probably accomplished nothing on my own, I was very inexperienced with working on a team, very inexperienced outside of my hobby projects, very inexperienced at actually coding for money.

I could accomplish things on my own, but not in a group setting with existing code.

I even tried asking questions and getting involved.

Everyone else had degrees and experience. Not me. Felt like a fish out of water.

In retrospect, I think that job just wasn't for me, they didn't have the right kind of work to give to a newbie like me, though they tried. They gave me some projects to work on but they needed ASAP and I didn't have enough time to research what I needed to learn.

It isn't fun when you feel like you can't keep up. I know first hand.

I'm not sure what to say, as I wish I had some advice. I wish maybe I would have gotten involved more, and maybe accept that I am a newbie, and I should ask more questions, humble myself and learn from the people who have been there longer basically.

I do the same at times, mostly when I'm just not really feeling too good I guess, bad sleep, too much coffee, etc. Usually my anxiety episodes go away and things feel normal again for a while."
