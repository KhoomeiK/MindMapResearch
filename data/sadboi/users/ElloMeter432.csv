Im sorry for you that you were shown off on social media, social media is a concept that's too much for a child to handle and your parents should've known better.

> and that I should feel awful for ever wanting to think otherwise. 

thats spot on aswell, I remember her telling me that I should be grateful for the food and shelter she gave me (lol) when I tried to tell her how I feel. Luckily she moved out and lives with her new boyfriend now."

 you know what you did wrong and for me it looks like you are searching for approval because you have the people and tools around you to change and you know you need to change and still you ask online people if they think wheter you are a psychopath or not.

Even if you lack empathy, we can not tell you and even if we could, it would not change a single thing because no matter what, you will have to work on yourself if you want to change they way you are living.
