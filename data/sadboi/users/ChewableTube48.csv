Two mods that change the same thing. The lower one will over ride but could cause crashing. 
I like this order for mine 

1. Uesp patch like mods
2. Small additions like weapons amd armor, and little gameplay adjustments
3. Bigger additions like perks and quests
4. Anything NPC related. NPCs, npc quests, abilities, weapons, armor, and changes
5. Graphics mods. Be careful here these sometimes need to be loaded in a specific order. A pack that is many mods should tell u how to load and to load certain things below them.
6. Weather mods a d water mods
7. Lighting mods, only pick one for interior amd one for exterior. Having multiple will break stuff.
8. Catch all spot for mods that specifically say load at bottom. U will have to experiment with the internal order of the category if u have a couple that demand loading at the bottom.


Hope this helps."

***disclaimer*** - I am in no way an expert, this is just share of what knowledge I have


I received a couple of $50 bonds from my grandmother. Each one has a different year printed on them signifying the *maturity* date. So example. The $50 bond matures in  April of 2021, meaning that date is when I can get the full $50. You can cash it early and receive less money or you can keep holding on to and it will continue to gain interest (set at the time of purchase).

The few I have matured a few years ago and are now worth about $5 to $10 more depending on the maturity year. 
My suggestion is to hold onto them until they mature at the least. There is a [website](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice) to check US Savings Bonds and their current worth.

we have a loss on functionality in the God build builder (lol). As in, IN game and in the preview it shows 6 slots for each row, (starter, core, offense, defense, situational, and consumable) but we are only allowed to save 4 items per row.

My biggest problem is the lack of HUD customizability. I watch the streams and see things moved around and expanded on pc. Like the friendly god icons are moved or scaled down, the players own god build is larger or completely different. The health bar and mana right above ability icons is neat.  Even the location of the Feed and game announcements is in different locations. Only option we get to to move the Map about an inch. 


All the changes seem good and I look forward to it. I enjoy the cleaner look. And as another user said, the notification icons Have to be centered.

smitetraining,fm7bsdf,t3_ftiw3l,1585820875.0,"Being that far behind means you aren't pathing through the jungle right. I'm by no means a good jungler but it's common to drop speed, harpie, blue,  mid harpies, then try n get some xps from mid lane minions or help gank mid lane depending on how much pressure your mid has. Then go to small mid harpies and red buff, back harpies. From here I usually back and depending on how long I take, i  go back to yellow and start again. Keep an eye on where the enemy jungler is at and try and place with them. If they pop over to duo then you should as well. You don't need to fight them. Just make an appearance with your duo laners. Now if any lanes are getting pushed back I tend to try n help them recover pressure or even taking over the lane while they back. 

Like I said I'm bot that good. These are my start strats and they seem to keep me in level with the enemy. A lot of jungle is situational and can change game to game. You could litterly farm until lol 15 before you get a team fight our you could be foraging at  level 3. You just have to watch for the signs and pick the best route.
