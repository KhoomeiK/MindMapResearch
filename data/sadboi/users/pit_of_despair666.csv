I believe I need the opposite of what they do. I don't need to be numbed. I need to feel good. They are working on making alternatives available.

I am glad that you don't want to do that again and know it is wrong. It sucks to not feel and a lot of ""Psychopaths"" turn to drugs and or crime to feel something. The sooner you get help the better."

They are reluctant to give out that diagnosis, as it brands you for the rest of your life. Like I said, just go see a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist if possible. Hopefully, you are just on the spectrum and are a high functioning Autist. Not caring if your family lives or dies set off an alarm in my head. I have a Psychology degree, have worked in healthcare, and have dated a couple of ""Psychopaths"", one was officially diagnosed, and just didn't care about anything."
anhedonia,fq5ad5a,t1_fq58z6a,1589097939.0,I don't think a vitamin deficiency would cause you to not care about your own family. This kid needs to see a Psychiatrist.
anhedonia,fq5a5rm,t1_fq59wyy,1589097735.0,You could also be on the spectrum and might be too young for an ASPD diagnosis. They may diagnose you with conduct disorder for now.
anhedonia,fq59wyy,t3_ggwoue,1589097487.0,I would see a Psychiatrist and be truthful. Ask them straight up to test for ASPD.
