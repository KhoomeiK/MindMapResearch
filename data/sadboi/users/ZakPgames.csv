I got here because I fell down the rabbit hole of depression and my mental state has decreased never tried hard in school probably borderline autistic and dropped out of college after failing to find piece of mind and fell behind because of lack of interest in the course (Game Design) 

Also when I was younger I was attacked left for dead that was pretty raw and also my entire family have been in arguments for years my dad would beat my mum and me my brother and sisters and hes an alcoholic never really bonded with him deadbeat dad cliche 
My mum has mental health conditions and is disabled don’t feel close to her either.

My brother is a cunt and found out recently that he’s a pedophile so that has ruined my entire image of him from when I was younger.

My sisters are both messes one is 26 and has done all the drugs and been in abusive relationships. My other sister is pretty much Satan and is pure evil.

I never planned a future because I honestly thought I would of killed myself by now but things are getting worse for me and I don’t see me progressing and getting better any time soon also life I don’t find interesting anymore it’s just the same thing everyday wake up repeat work eat sleep start over.

I have done a bunch of drugs for fun and to numb the pain of everyday life I regret ever doing drugs because I feel like on top of everything it doesn’t help but made things much worse.

I have a few friends that I’m grateful for but other than that my life is pretty much a meme 

I tried to be Social a lot more going out and hanging with friends but the truth is I’m not a people person they suck and I feel like I’m better off alone.
