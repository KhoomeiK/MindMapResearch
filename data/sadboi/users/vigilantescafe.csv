CasualConversation,fmbinkf,t3_fu1jcs,1585927124.0,"My best friends hang out with their families (cousins) a lot like an odd amount. I've never met people who hung out with their family all the time besides these two. I know I shouldn't but I feel incredibly unimportant and lonely because they don't really put effort into our friendship. They always have their cousins to talk to for problems and to rely on and to make plans with but they just can't seem to get that I don't have this and I rely on friends for those types of things so even though they call me their best friend, I don't know what time or experiences we've spent together that would back this friendship up"
CSULB,flnuwfw,t1_fln43jz,1585326336.0,Ohh I see. Thanks for the advice!

CSULB,fllitek,t1_fll8gy9,1585261164.0,"Thanks for the advice! I've signed up for his class! Did you take Hist173 with him too? If you did, do you know what books we need?"
CSULB,fll0klr,t1_flkx4oi,1585251357.0,The choices are Nancy Wikham or David Sheridan. I'm leaning towards taking Sheridan's class right now since there seems to be less essays

socialskills,fi9a0yj,t1_fi84yfg,1582259402.0,aww! thank you for the kind words! YOU'RE a ray of sunshine!!‚ò∫Ô∏è Yea I had a feeling they were jealous but I'm also wondering whether it could be due to them being really insecure. They've both revealed this to me so I've kinda let them off because I thought they weren't in the right mindset to lift me up yet. A part of me thinks they might just need to grow a little. I will 100% go find people who don't make me second guess my self worth though
Anxiety,fgexpyk,t3_exx6jc,1580714219.0,"I thought I was the only one!! In my case, I would get so anxious that it manifested into physical pain in my ears. I would cry and hyperventilate as a result. My parents yell at each other a lot so it caused me to be anxious about how to stop them from yelling. Long story short, I never figured out how which caused me to freak out and just go blank. At my serving job, i also had a shift lead who banged everything when he felt rushed/mad. It was horrible for my anxiety+ ears and I could never explain that to them."
CSULB,fecyv1k,t1_feckask,1578990345.0,Thank you for your input and I'm sorry you're in this unwanted situation as well. I've messaged my advisor and am contacting the UCUA for advice. I hope you find some sort of solution~
AsianBeauty,eued6vj,t3_cfi39y,1563741429.0,The dehydration in California is too much for my already dry skin! I'm looking for a moisturizer that gives that feeling of hydrating deep within the skin but there's so many new products coming out! Help a girl out with some recommendations please\~
socialskills,eu4yold,t3_ce8bdh,1563466142.0,"Omg I thought it was just me! I find that it's hard for me to say bye when there's a large group of people and they're all scattered. I feel like I'm really quiet so I don't want to say bye and not be heard. In addition, I'm so shy that I don't want to interrupt someone's conversation or activity just to say bye. It's weird but I guess I'm just afraid of not being heard. I don't want to try to be loud either because it would make me feel extremely awkward."
depression,eq5j320,t3_anh7tv,1559802868.0,"I got my admission to my universities withdrawn because I failed a class. I don't even know if I can stay at my community college and transfer the next year because technically I graduated. I ignored my depression which led me failing. Throughout the whole semester, I feel like I lost the ability to think and I had a really hard time remembering things. This made me feel like an idiot. Like I can't be a normal human. I've been cutting off people and withdrawing myself from friends more because I feel like they don't deserve to talk to a living corpse. I feel like I'm already dead. Like it's a mistake that I'm living. Its hard to listen to music or watch shows because it doesn't make me feel anything and that just reminds me of how empty I am. Everything seems like it's in slow motion and I'm struggling to just even make an appointment with a therapist."
