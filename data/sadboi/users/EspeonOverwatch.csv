Fast forward an hour I print out the reg card and do all the checking in, blah blah.
First she wanted to see how far the room was since it was on the third floor ( our first floor ones flooded earlier this year) and she seemed okay with it, since said husband could walk but would just use his wheelchair, no biggie.

She comes down half an hour later, furious at me that the room is ""too small"" and there's no room to move about, and that the wheelchair had scraped against our dresser and that they ""better not be charged for it"" mind you, I've been in that room before, I know for a fact there's enough room for even two wheelchairs to get in the area she mentioned. She then complained about the shower, saying it was not a walk in, when I also know for a fact it is. She told me ""I BET YOU BOOKED THE LAST HANDICAPPED ROOM TO SOMEONE ELSE AND YOU JUST LIED ABOUT IT TO US"" no. That's not how that works.

Then, in the morning, they were waiting for my boss and blocking the door, so about 10 or so guests couldn't leave, saying there were cockroaches by the elevator, and that I told them they could go down the steps if there was a fire... I was NEVER asked that. Apparently they kept telling lies about me to my boss, but my boss knows me well and didn't believe them because she knows how I treat guests, and it isn't like that."
