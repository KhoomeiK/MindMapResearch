You are not inventory, you are the people who loves your LO the most. Before your baby can communicate, the best way to show them you love them is to be there for them when they cry IMO.
But i'm biased. My birthgiver would ignore me when i cried. I learned that my birthgiver only loved the happy version of me and if i wasn't happy, they would leave me.

My daughter was younger when she had her first sleepover. MIL called me at 10 in the evening and asked if i could come get DD because she was distressed. My MIL lives across the road, less than a minute away.

You don't have to give birth to be a mom, anyone can give birth. It's all the hard work after the baby is born that makes a mom. Staying up late when she's sick, walking her to school, kissing her tears away when she's sad, listening to her, loving her. Blood means nothing when it comes to love."

I have a birthgiver like yours. She can be great when she wants to. But after having kids of my own, I can't imagine not wanting to be the best mom i can be to them, every single second i have.

Can she be a great mom? Or was she just able to pretend for a short while? I know I'll never know because I haven't called her for 7 years and she hasn't noticed yet.

I have been with my SO for 9 years now. Prior to him, i had a two-year period with one-night stands and short relationships, but so did everyone else around me because of the alcohol culture and openness towards sex in my country.
I never had a friend for more than a year or two in real life. I'm better with friends online.

I have been told i'm atypical because i react on the inside instead of the outside. People don't believe me when i tell them i'm unhappy or upset. I can get a certain kind of angry that can fill a room with chills, but besides that, i look pretty stoic at all times.

It's like i have this mask i used to love to wear because it kept the awfulness at a distance, but now it's like a prison, keeping me from feeling like a part of the world. It will not let go of me, even when i'm screaming on the inside. I look too well functioning to get the help i feel like i need. I want to act out so everyone can see how batshit i really am, but i can't. The distance prevents me.

You can deffinetly have BPD without having many sexual partners, but a whole different problem i see here is that no matter if you have BPD or not, your therapist should at least hear you out and make you feel listened to, it doesn't sound like you got that experience.

In my opinion, a good therapist would have listened to you and have you list your reasons why, and then follow up by talking about the symptoms you experience. If they wanted to steer you away from BPD, they could have done so with kindness. You shouldn't walk away from therapy feeling invalidated.

Sometimes i can tell him why i think it's unlikely and that helps him relax.

Be her friend in this. Be someone she can trust and confide in. Don't tell her she's wrong or needs to be fixed, but do express your love and concerns for her wellbeing. You want to help her get better, not force her to get better.

Maybe an elf ran away because they were tired of watcing naughty kids and they need a christmas break at a nice kid's house.

I was so scared of it, i rarely ate anything during december. I didn't want to spend longer than i had to at that table. I don't even remember what he looks like because i was too scared to look at it. What if i could see him looking back at me? Ugh. No thank you.

My kids have elfs that visit at night to leave a present, paint their nails or wrap their schoolbags in christmas paper. The elf doesn't report to santa in my house. It helps create christmas spirit and decorate the house."

What worked for me was to think about the issues and let myself react to the emotions it made me feel until i could think about it without being affected too much. 

After that i started talking about it in loose terms to internet strangers. They validated my experiences and gave me the courage to start talking to my boyfriend, still in loose terms, only giving out detals i was comfortable with.

I haven't told my therapist all the details, but they get the big picture of the mess i grew up in and we have been able to start working with some of the problems my issues are causing.

Basically, it's about a mean boy who gets angry at others a lot. His father tells him to hammer a nail in the fence whenever he lets hit anger hurt others. When he apologizes, he can remove the nail. 
After a year there are no more nails in the fence because the boy learned to control his anger and apologized to all the people he hurt.
But the fence was full of holes.
The father told the boy that when you hurt someone, it's like the nails in the fence. You can pull the nail by apologizing, but the fence will have a hole forever.

-Every feeling i have ever had, has passed eventually.

-Bad outcome doesn't mean bad intentions.

-Everybody fucks up all the time, yet the world is still spinning.

-it's ok not to be ok.

I try to do things that I'm good at or can finish. If i'm angry i clean, cry or exercise.

I guess i just try to accept that I have this emotion and remind myself that it's ok to have a feeling without acting on it. 
As soon as i recognize a strong negative feeling i try to stop and think about what started it and if my emotional reaction is appropiate. Sometimes i need other people's input. If i'm overreacting, i wait it out.  

And I'm almost 31 now. I just started seeing improvement 4 years ago. It's hard at first, so start out with tiny expectations and allow yourself to feel good for small achievements."

I used to be jealous about the smallest things and I (sort of) started growing out of it around the age of 27. I think maturity and practice are the biggest factors.
With practice and time, it becomes easier.

Everybody compares themselves to their peers all the time. Learn to forgive yourself when you do. It's not about winning, it's about trying. Just keep trying and you will win eventually. The only people who never win are the ones that stop trying. 

I wish i could help with your selfesteem. I tried compaing the amount of patience, love and respect i give myself to the amount i give others. I should at least be as kind to myself as i would be to a stranger on the street.
I tried doing things i feel good at doing. Like drawing, writing, doing nails.
I tried pretending i have a mom who loves me and imagining what she would say (I don't have a mom)
