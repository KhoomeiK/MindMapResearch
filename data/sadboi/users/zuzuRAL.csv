StopSelfHarm,fr3xkwr,t3_gm9a06,1589869161.0,"Breathe. That's the first thing you can do when feeling overwhelmed. It can help you focus and find something you can do instead of hurting yourself. Breathe slowly. If you feel like it's impossible, try to hold breath for 5-10 seconds.

It's okay how you feel. It's normal that you crave am escape from the situation or the feelings. Your brain have this tool and feel like it will work. What you need to do is to give him other tools to escape. 

You can listen to music, draw, go for walk, read a book, play game on your phone, watch a video. Anything that make you think about something else. There's no shame if you find yourself crying and blaming everyone for everything. 

When I had hard day, it helped to make a deal with my brain that if I feel like cutting myself first thing in the morning, I can do it. But it worked only when I knew, that I will be okay by that time. 

You wrote that you don't want to tell your coworkers to stop with the jokes that hurt you. Maybe is worth a try to pick one you feel least uncomfortable and tell them how you feel. It won't be easy, but it's necessary for you to fight your monster alone."

If you're school has a therapist or psychologist, try to get appointment with them. They could at least get you the resources you need.

Second step is to understand what is going on. Either with therapist you get/find or even by yourself in the meantime. I recommend Kati Morton's videos, but there is much more. This is her playlist. Just mind the titles of videos and don't watch anything triggering for you:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_loxoCVsWqxUuzhjHu7Ra_UyKd4tEde2

Third step is to learn your coping mechanisms. When you feel the urge try to distract yourself. If you feel need to hurry yourself instead of killing yourself try first doing something you like. Once a bagel with Nutella literally saved my life. Go for walk or build a safe space. Do anything that you feel like doing from reading a book through watching YouTube to going for brisk walk. Anything can help. 

Don't hesitate to call crisis link or ambulance. There are people trained to help you handle these situations. Nobody will be mad at you, nobody will judge. 

And finally, be prepared to allow people to help you. There's no shame in our. If it's a teacher, a friend, your family or anyone, give them a chance. Even when they are annoyingly positive or pity. As long as they acknowledge your feelings and condition, of course."

It's not you, it's your illness. 

If you feel like you can't make it, don't hesitate to call crisis link or text service or even chat. I recommend to find your resources and put them into your phone. There are people to help you. People that care

May I ask what were you feeling and what happened in the therapy before, maybe weeks before, you first hurt yourself? You don't need to reply, just try to write down some thoughts. Get back to them after a few days and maybe you can write more.

For me it was my mum that triggered me to my first time. She just didn't understand, didn't acknowledged that I have a real problem. I was feeling trapped when we were talking on the phone. I was really reconsidering my thoughts on suicide, but I didn't want that. Also my first selfharm was just like a dream. I was sitting by the desk and it just happened.

In general you can motivate yourself in two ways. By something special you do at the end of a day or after a hard task. Like you can watch Netflix for the rest of time window after you for example read a chapter of the non-fictional book you like to read. Or you can treat yourself while you are doing the activity.

Many mental illnesses, for example BPD, and neurological differeces, as far as I understand the gender dysphoria is one, share the traits people see it even how we feel about ourselves. And there is need for trained professionals who can distinguish them.

Yes, there are many people, who were diagnosed as transgender by mistake or bias of the therapist. As well as there are people who are called sick by their families because of transphobia. 

If you are in a difficult situation, you can always call the crisis hotline. There are always here for you. They can help you find a solution you might not yet see. Like find the online / phone therapy you can afford. Writing to the Reddit, no matter what thread, is also great option, but sometimes a bit slower ;) 

Maybe you can try to talk with your parents about your feeling and what in detail make them feel like you have wrong diagnosis. Find the way you comfortable with. Write the letter or go out and text them. I find it easier with my mother, but still not easy. I need to take long breaks between messages and still didn't overcome the feeling I hurt her.

Do you like to get up early in the morning or rather stay up long into the night? Maybe you like exercise or you always told yourself you would like to read some book or watch the show everybody is talking about.

If you want it more organized, take a paper a draw a weekly timetable. Start with things that are given, like a part-time job or a sunday lunch with parents. 

Then wake up time routine. Do you shower in the morning? Do you eat breakfast or drink a coffee? Read a book, watch YouTube or exercise? Start with things you are already doing and think about things you liked to do in the past. Even if it was watching morning cartoons for the hours :) 

Then bedtime routine. Again think about things you are already doing, besides studying till morning and then passing out lying on the book ;) Do you like to drink a cup of tea and watch some show? Or rather reading a book? 

Now take your list and start putting the activities in your table. Remember to plan buying, preparing and eating food. If you find yourself with to many empty places you can find something in the thread r/hobbies. You can try one new hobby a week until your schedule is full. And don't feel bad if something just doesn't work on the long run. 

Or try some new projects. For example I am studying informatics and there are some great ideas on simple tools I wanted to make me myself. I also got and idea to upcycle some of the delivery bags into toys for my bunny after I saw https://youtu.be/cB0CBaB5cWc . 

And most important, stay social. Try to plan some activities or talk with people you are living with. It's also great way how to get inspiration for new activities. You can determine to write one person you are normally not in touch a week. You wrote you don't feel comfortable in your group of friends. Maybe taking one-on-one might worth a try. Or not. You can also try to write some friends from your past, Facebook is good tool for this ;) And don't exclude family members from this list.

For the times when you are scared there are people who can help you. The easiest way is to call the crisis link or text messages. Just goggle crisis link in you area. You can always call the emergency, if you don't know else. They won't be mad at you, they won't put you in mental hospital. You can just talk with people who won't judge you.

In the meantime, you can find some resources on how to get your others under control, how to set the rules you are comfortable with. Mine was to cut only certain part of your body, to respect clean day when I decided, use only dedicated tool and to never need stitches.

It's also good to educate yourself on selfharm to better understand it. You can go for walk and use anonymous web browsing in your phone.

I didn't wanna deal with it. But then I find myself going through my room, bathroom and even kitchen drawers to find something sharp enough to cut myself. 

Baby steps. Don't try to stop forever now. When you feel the urge, day yourself that you TRY to not to do it for 15 minutes. And don't forget to distract yourself. Play a game, watch some video. You can set an alarm if you find yourself constantly checking the time. 

Then tell yourself to wait till the evening / next morning or some set time each day when you allow yourself to do it if you feel so.

Then choose two days in a week, at least two days apart, when you will not do it. From the midnight to the morning next day. Plan some activities like watching Netflix all day long or going for a walk. It will be hard but you can do it.

Then you can try to lengthen the time period, like I don't hurt myself till weekend. After some time you find yourself at the mark of twelve days and feel like to try more. You will relapse, you will feel like in way with you own mind for a long time. But it's okay. It just takes time.

But most important is to find your trigger. Try to go back to the start, what made you but yourself for the first time? What was happening? What is happening in your head when you're doing it? Writing a journal and getting a therapist could help. Or you can call a hotline when you start to feel an urge and don't know what to do.

Shit happened and my plan fall apart when I needed retake one of my tests. I was angry.

Then when I started taking antidepressants I was feeling awful. I had several plans how to do it, but my partner was always there and I didn't want him to stop me. 

When I was sixteen I was always standing on the balcony on the 8th floor thinking that it would be so easy. I was a coward and didn't do it. The only thing I was able to do was to open window on school trip in the middle of the winter to freeze myself.

Yes, you can always do it. And these feelings are normal. If you find yourself in a situation when you would care to not do it, try to call the crisis link to talk to someone. Or if you don't like how are you feeling you can do it even now.

It's not your fault. And it's your life. But it's permanent solution to a temporary problem. Depression rarely last more than few months in a row. https://youtu.be/xNNZMJy6DqI

If you have nobody to talk definitely try crisis hotline or chat if you feel like it. There are people who can understand and even help you to find a therapist to talk to regularly. 

It's normal that people around us don't understand. It's not our fault. It's not your fault that somebody is not listening. I recommend seeding the lecture on depression from doctor Sapilsky, available at https://youtu.be/NOAgplgTxfc . It helped me to understand what may be happening in my head. That it's real illness.

StopSelfHarm,fql4row,t3_gje25f,1589446218.0,"It's normal that your brain wants to get rid of this thoughts and do something familiar for it. 

You can either distract yourself from the thoughts or challenge them. Write them on the paper and then find an activity, that needs all you attention. Like reading relaxing book, meditation, PC games. Or you can try some physical activity. Mindfulness is also great. 

Don't forget to go back to your paper and challenge the thoughts when you feel better. You can pretend that you are at your court and you need to persuade judge, that they are true. Be careful to use rational and bulletproof arguments. Then take the other side and persuade the judge, why the thoughts are not entirely true or false at all. 

Than what would you say to your friend, if they tell you something like this? What do they need to hear to feel better? The best is if you can rewrite these thoughts in more true and less harmful way.

Most important, start small, one though at time. You may check something about cognitive fauls and CBT techniques. Book Feeling Good by David Burns is ment for general public.

One of the tools I find useful I know as painful time. Reserve 5 to 10 minutes a day to get caught in your negative or intrusive thoughts. Take your list or just say something harmful again and again to yourself. Set an alarm and plan some pleasurable activity afterwards. Or at least something intense, like eating a lemon. 

Then whenever your thoughts come back you can say: ""Not now, see you at the five."" Maybe try to not set your time too close to bedtime. And if time is though, you can make your 5-10 minutes sooner. Like ok thoughts, you have five minutes and that's all. It take time and discipline to fully work, so don't give up.

And remember, it's ok to have a bad episode of relapse, but you did it once, you can do it again. Don't push or be angry with you, when it's not tomorrow."

And when you are preparing meal you can pretend you are preparing it for somebody else or maybe you can ask someone to help you.

When it comes to calories, try more dense foods. If you can handle it, try to drink juice or soda around your meal. Take every diet recommendation and do the exact opposite. Full fat milk, fat cheese, butter. Best way is to consult dietitian, who can help you to make a meal plan.

How long have you been steady on the same medication with the same therapist? It is never bad to ask someone for second opinion. Off topic, but my allergies got under control after I changed my doctor. 

There are many therapeutic approaches. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is pretty effective on people with depression and anxiety. I recommend asking your therapist about their opinion in your case. 

When it comes to anxiety, the best way for me is combination of breathing, writing down everything that goes in my mind and drawing when words are not enough. The breathing pattern 3-3-8 was recommended by therapist. 3 seconds inhale, 3 seconds stop your breath and 8 seconds out. You might feel dizzy, but that's the point. The anxiety may come back after while, but that moment in peace is priceless."

DBT is more focused on accepting the negative feelings, as far as I know.

It really depends, whether I immediately want to f*ck someone or just hold them in hands or don't trust them at all.

For the beginning move yourself from the bad. Lie on a couch or even kitchen floor with blanket and maybe some stuffed animals. 
Find your comfortable place outside of a bed. Prefer places where other people are of possible. Some distraction from your thoughts are good. You can try to ask for some tea or cocoa. 
Then find a ""hobby"". Something you can do other than scrolling social media. You can pick up a show or a series on YouTube and make dedication to watch it or even better pick a book. It will be hard to force yourself to read but it is a great escape from your head even for little while. Or just listen to lyrics of random song or song you like / liked.
Then you can work towards things you should do. Pick only one task per day. For example to brush your teeth. Try to do it as soon as possible. Then return to your comfortable place or even to bed if you need it. If you fail, do not try to do the same thing the next day. Try something different. For example clean your face or open the window and let the fresh air into the room. Anything counts. 
Then make a morning routine. Like clean your face and teeth every morning. Or make your bed when you move to your comfortable place. Nothing fancy. You can whenever add morning coffee or short meditation.

Just be kind to yourself, than is the only thing that matters now. It is the only thing you really must."
