depression,fp40yex,t3_gaymww,1588289541.0,For me I don’t remember practically my whole life. Also I can’t tell the difference between real life and dreams. But I do have that. I remember a lot of bad things but I barely remember anything good. It sucks
depression,fow0i7t,t3_g9ndgw,1588110778.0,I feel that too. I stopped living at 13. I understand you.
depression,fntma61,t3_g3df9g,1587244507.0,I feel the same day when my depression really kills me. I think that a lot and I’m always scared to die because I don’t know what happens but I wanted to just couldn’t do it cause I’m scared. I understand
depression,fni0cyn,t3_g1ixac,1586971840.0,I understand. For me I do want to get better sometimes but I want to get better without getting rid of the depression. I know the bad choices I make but I feel like idk who I am without my depression. When I am happy I don’t like it and I’m like where is my dark buddy? And it is hard. I want my depression to stay and I don’t want people helping but I can’t tell them cause they think I’m crazy or something.
depression,fn1cy62,t1_fn1cu87,1586559437.0,Yea. I know.
depression,fn1bmkr,t1_fn1bj9n,1586558679.0,The hardest for me is to accept the help.
depression,fn1bl8f,t3_fyhbox,1586558658.0,The hardest for me is accepting the help.
depression,fn1bh21,t1_fn1bb9u,1586558591.0,I know. I’ve recently been trying to think more like that but it’s hard. But that’s true. Staying by someone’s side no matter what is way better than words and helps a lot.
depression,fn1836g,t1_fn17yh7,1586556660.0,Yea. I hate it. It annoys me and just makes me more depressed.
depression,fn0kqjf,t3_fyhbox,1586543734.0,I hate it when people say that to me. The worst for me is when they are like “oh it will get better. Just think positive and you will be ok.” And I just say nothing and walk away with a fake smile on my face thinking “they don’t give a crap about me!” It just annoys me so much. I understand what you mean.
depression,fmpw980,t1_fmpw5kc,1586288486.0,Thanks. I’ll try
depression,fmpvzam,t1_fmpvwhb,1586288344.0,Thanks
depression,fmpvsnz,t1_fmpuukk,1586288246.0,Feels like I am a lot.
CPTSD,fmpmsu1,t3_fwbzqz,1586283621.0,Yes. I honestly don’t know half my life. I always think that I have a bad memory and that’s why I always say I can’t remember half my life. I only remember flashes of my life and I feel bad cause my family will say remember this and I’ll be like no. Then sometimes I can tell between reality and dreams.
depression,fmpjtwd,t3_fwnmg6,1586282119.0,Still here. Physically I am. Mentally I’m asleep and dead
selfharm,fmpfnfq,t1_fmpfjkf,1586279989.0,I feel the same way! Totally understand you. It’s nice to know other people are on this and understand. It doesn’t make me feel as alone as normal
selfharm,fmpewef,t1_fmpesm6,1586279606.0,It’s ok. When I think this ive always thought it was for attention and I felt really bad. But your not alone. Don’t worry.
selfharm,fmpe7yt,t3_fw8tek,1586279263.0,To be honest I do that too and lots of times I feel bad but I do understand a lot
selfharm,fm9cb4d,t1_fm9c90c,1585865846.0,I’m just going crazy.
selfharm,fm98pt3,t3_ftpa5z,1585863861.0,I’ve recently been figuring out it’s an addictions and it’s hard to stop and my mind is crazy right now. Wish I could stop but also I don’t want too.
selfharm,flloex8,t1_fllodol,1585264506.0,Sadly true my Dudette
selfharm,fllnppz,t1_fllnokp,1585264094.0,Easier said than done.
selfharm,fllnhtq,t1_fllnfsl,1585263964.0,Thanks. It’s true. I’ll try. Maybe.
selfharm,flln17a,t1_fllmsqa,1585263688.0,I know you are. It’s just hard. Idk. Thanks friend.
depression,flis7vt,t1_flis4ny,1585189460.0,You’re welcome. I understand. You can vent to me anytime if ya need someone. Take care.
selfharm,flipjbc,t1_flipgwm,1585187681.0,Thanks. I will if I need a friend or a chat.
selfharm,fliomoj,t1_fliohuk,1585187105.0,Thanks. You seem very nice. Thanks. Yea I’m just down in my dark mental cave right now.
selfharm,flinlm7,t3_foot9k,1585186438.0,For me i do understand depression since I’ve had it for a while. But lots of times I say “oh people have it worse” because for me I just think that my depression doesn’t matter and all that. So that’s why I say that to myself.
selfharm,flinaos,t3_foydmg,1585186242.0,Thanks. That’s very kind. Recently I have just been down and depressed cause of staying home a lot and I’ve hurt myself again. So I can’t wait to go back to school. Because I am going insane. Sorry for small rant.
depression,fli6ycs,t3_fov277,1585176514.0,I understand your questions. I ask those to myself everyday. I’m sorry you ask yourself these questions a lot but I do understand that. And I know that my comment probably doesn’t help or mean much. I don’t know. I guess I just wanted to let you know that you aren’t alone. If ya wanna talk I’m here.
depression,flgwslc,t3_fon2l0,1585151816.0,I understand that. Because for me I understand when people say you need to love yourself and all that but it’s a lot easier said than done. I’m in a relationship yet I am still depressed as hell. And I fricking hate myself and all that but there is no way I can love myself. For me if I hear a complement or try to do the thing where people say do an exercise and say love myself in the mirror everyday. I have tried it. I always feel discusting and I want to hurt myself if I say that to myself. It’s just hard I’ll probably never be fully happy but I have learned to accept it. Sadly. Sorry about my rant.
depression,fleesms,t3_fo8wsh,1585083008.0,I get that feeling a lot. I do understand that. It’s uncomfortable but idk what to do about it.
selfharm,flb86sr,t1_flb85l8,1584999351.0,💗
selfharm,flb847j,t1_flb7ym8,1584999310.0,Thanks ma dude. Love ya too. Glad you are my friend. I would be lost without you.
mentalhealth,flb7xpe,t3_fnoqqx,1584999205.0,So for me who has abandonment issues and takes antidepressants. For me it doesn’t work. But it depends because everyone is different. So maybe it will work for you. Don’t know till ya try.
selfharm,fl8tqup,t3_fn96lm,1584932088.0,I’m sorry that happened. Your daughter sounds like a great caring girl.
LesbianActually,fl7vra5,t3_fmppx3,1584910423.0,You are definitely cute.
depression,fl7tqkx,t1_fl7toz7,1584909186.0,Haha. Thanks my demon dude.
depression,fl7tnhv,t1_fl7t7q1,1584909134.0,Thanks my dudette! You’re the best. I care about you too. As Cristina says to Meredith “you’re my person” 💗
depression,fl7az3q,t3_fn1vc8,1584898012.0,I haven’t been doing great either. I’ve been really depressed. I don’t want to do much either and I’ve been thinking about death too. I’m not suicidal but I have just been thinking a lot. And I’m just really down 24/7
depression,fl57nd2,t1_fl57hbw,1584830352.0,Also learning to “love myself” I can’t. And yea. That stuff
depression,fl57kln,t1_fl57hbw,1584830301.0,I’m female but identify as Genderfluid. And the challenging part for me is working through the depression and harming self.
depression,fl56qij,t1_fl56jat,1584829752.0,Not overweight. Also I know. I do have to shape up it’s just hard to do that. I’ve been trying but it’s been hard. It’s stupid.
depression,fl55hw8,t1_fl550me,1584828943.0,Meh. I don’t get much attention frim my parents. It’s pretty lonely but still I care about them even for the stuff they did that kind of hurt me. As long as they are happy. Appearently I actually don’t really know that much about what “love” but whatever. Who can love me? Haha no one. So I’ll just live in darkness.
depression,fl558v2,t1_fl550fs,1584828782.0,Better my family is happy than me.
depression,fl54571,t1_fl53x7b,1584828068.0,Either way I don’t really enjoy my life because I hate myself. Honestly who would even care if I died. No one. So it doesn’t even matter. But still. I have to protect them. Because I have to protect anyone even if it costs me a price.
depression,fl540iw,t1_fl53siw,1584827984.0,Well if I tell my parents about my depression which they know but with what’s going on now my mom is an emotional person where she will start crying and my dad will just annoy me. I don’t want to cause any trouble for them. I’m already an annoying bitch so why should I bother them.
depression,fl53l6o,t1_fl53e38,1584827710.0,It’s ok. I’ll survive. I’m used to pretending and being depressed and everything. It’s just my life. But I got my pup to help me stay somewhat sane ish lol
depression,fl5140d,t3_fmbsdc,1584826118.0,Sorry you are feeling bad. If you wanna talk I’ll listen and try to help. But I understand what you mean. Feel better. Send me a message if ya Wanna talk or anything.
depression,fkmz6vs,t3_fj8mva,1584346112.0,I have that like ever single day. I think it every time I see them or text them and it sucks. But you have to push through. Somehow.
depression,fkf0vo1,t1_fkez0h6,1584124757.0,Thanks. Bai.
depression,fketqru,t1_fketngv,1584120494.0,Thanks my Dudette.
CPTSD,fkczjww,t3_fhgino,1584064795.0,Lots of times I say that I was in a good family but I’m starting to somewhat realize differently but I still think whatever. It doesn’t matter. Other people go through worse and mine doesn’t matter. I have been called incompetent before and I start to believe everything anyone tells me except the good stuff. My girlfriend says that I’ve gone through emotional and verbal abuse. A part of me believes her because my depression is mostly from my past. If someone yells at me I freeze and just blank and shut down in fear. I can’t even talk with ought almost crying even though I’ve forced myself to not cry for years. I felt like I have always had to be the strong one and it sucks. I just say to myself all the time it doesn’t matter you deserve it. And I believe it now. Sorry I’ll shush now. Sorry.
SuicideWatch,fkcxtmf,t3_f9d5go,1584063651.0,I have that thought everyday and I hate it but also I don’t. I can’t get rid of it and it just haunts me all the time.

depression,fdxs2r9,t3_en7336,1578772346.0,I feel that all the time. I get depressed a lot but I want to stop it but also I don’t want the darkness to go away because it’s like my safe heaven now. Some understand but some dont.
lgbt,fdr2mpb,t1_fdqxycl,1578678694.0,Yea I know. It’s all good lol
lgbt,fdqvr2v,t1_fdqvj7q,1578675590.0,Yea I know. It’s just an idea I thought of and I’ll probable change later maybe. Who knows.
