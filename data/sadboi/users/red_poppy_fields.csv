About a year back I was trying to ""reset"" my gut biome to try to deal with inflammation and intolerances and decided to take a whack at a shepards pie. For this recipe you are supposed to make mashed cauliflower with almond milk, and put it over peas and low fat ground beef, seasoned with nothing but salt. 

Not only is I over cook the meat, but I royaly messed up the cauliflower mash. I didn't cook the cauliflower long enough so I ended up with riced cauliflower. And it wasn't until it was to late, that I realized I used sweetened vanilla almond milk. Because the cauliflower was riced the sweet almond milk soaked straight through and stewed the whole mess for 45 minutes. My wonderful husband tried to eat every bite he could muster before I took it from his hands and dumped the entire nightmare away.

 It was (and I do not say this lightly) the worst thing either of us has ever put into our mouths."

Meditation,fojtz7e,t3_g7u7mk,1587829345.0,"I too have an addictive personality, and I have found that the best thing that I can do when I fall into these traps of addiction/obsession is to work on introspection. It's very helpful with a Therapist, but you can find workbooks as well. You have to start trying to weed out the reasons you are struggling with these issues. And if it boils down to just body chemistry that's alright as well (it just sometimes is related to previous tramas or fears). These sadly aren't things that can be fixed instantly and take some mental work to push through. 

Our thoughts come and go as they please, and it can feel very overwhelming to have them bombarding you all day, every day. It can make meditation very difficult, have you attempted guided medications?

DesignMyRoom,fndrz3m,t1_fnavzxq,1586876363.0,"It depends on your style as to how you decorate the kitchen. I'm afraid a modern aesthetic would be much more difficult to pull off with the current cabinetry. However, not impossible.

If you enjoy eclectic or bohemian style, I would paint the walls in a rich color, and add a vintage runner, maybe paint the door as well and It could function like an art piece. I think alot can be added just in the decorations of a kitchen! You can get wall decals in a large variety of styles! 

There are lots of different styles, my suggestion would be to replace things like your fruit bowl or your  utensil jug, and if you have any plants maybe re pot them in pots that better express your tastes. Then, if you're still unhappy, consider painting the walls to match one or more of those objects, and look into adding a rug ( I know there are mixed feelings about rugs in the kitchen, if you have children or a messy dog or find yourself spilling liquids alot it's a big hassle. But if it's just you, I find they are actually wonderful if you've got a lot of cooking to do and they vacuum up quite easily)

So if you go with black and whites for the colors with the furnishings they will basically turn whatever color the light is.

When I was a kid I had similar issues, my room was this childish sunshine yellow (like for a nursery) I changed my decor to all black and silver, and then later I just covered it in art work and black wall decals to try to cover it up. If you are able to get a job or save up money and offer to do it yourself maybe your parents will be more  open to changing it. (If they move they're gonna have to change it anyways and that color is gonna take some heavy coats to cover, youd be doing them a favor by changing the color if I'm being honest)

Personally, for my style, I would change the hardware  to black, change the backsplash( to a different color) and change the color to a cool grey or a off white.

DesignMyRoom,fdgrf5e,t3_el8ss7,1578406378.0,"Alright, if you're gonna paint it red (which honestly go for it, just put down primer first so it's easier to sand off later) you might not wanna use spray paint it since you might get drips ( and if this is your first time spray painting you most likely will) the first think you'll want to do is

Scratch the lamp down so that paint will stick better  (you're just looking to scuff it up so it has tooth so the paint will stick better, try a wire brush or some steal wool)

Pick a heat resistant paint in the color you want

(If you're not using spray paint) Put down the primer using a cloth, then do the same with the paint. Itll take a bit of work, and you might want to experiment with different paint methods, but whatever you use, make it look intentional, if you want it smooth its gonna take a lot of work, and if you want texture itll be a similar story 

If you are using spray paint for the smooth texture, line the inside of the lamp with plastic or paper so the color dosen't seep through, if you wanna make it look nicer  put a ring of painter's tape an inch or two away from the rim (itll give it an interesting variation) then you're gonna wanna read the directions, the best thing to do is do this in several passes (which is time consuming but will give you a better finish) you'll wanna stand far enough away that the paint is landing softly on the lamp. Its important to let it dry completely between thin coats so that you dont get drips and build up. If you do get a drip just while it up with a paper towel and then let the whole thing dry before beginning again.

Also on a side note, if you're painting it red, add some more pops of red through out the room, a single statement pillow will balance it out visually"

sex,f5zrj77,t1_f5zfmym,1572584800.0,"Honestly my best advice would be to really dive into porn/smut with the physical attributes that you desire. Try to replace her specifically with the physical attributes that you're attracted to. Throw yourself into things that will use up the sexual energy and honestly. Be real with your gf and tell her that you think her friend is flirting with you (itll get rid of the -its so wrong but it feels to right-  feeling) she'll either be able to clarify the relationship or she'll be able to put a stop to it. If my friends were flirting with  my so I'd drop kick them because they need to understand boundaries and what's not okay. 

TLDR; best course of action is to tell the gf about her friends actions and to focus on the physical attributes that are arousing you by finding porn starts with them or by digging into enjoying those parts of your gf."
