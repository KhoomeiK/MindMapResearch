Savant,fqmpro8,t1_fqlhu5c,1589481467.0,"I'd argue that Turn Down For What had a lot more going for it than being abnormal. Catchy trap song produced by DJ Snake who is widely popular and well branded, Lil Jon's voice is insanely recognizable, and all these elements plus an easy to mix into buildup made it a shoe-in for a 2am hype song in clubs across the Western world.


Savant simply doesnt get play like that, resident DJs don't jump at the opportunity to play his music in clubs, most popular radio stations wouldnt touch it, and I rarely hear of Savant on the festival circuit (that mat be a bad point because I don't actually know how many live shows he plays in a year, but a solid year of festivals could really boost up his name assuming his live shows are quality.)


Still, as someone who mixes as a bedroom DJ, I'd always thought Champagne would be a banger in a mainstream club, or Nazareth/Princess of Zion would be so dope in an underground bass show. His music does have a place, I've just never heard a dj/radio/person at all every play any of his songs around me other than a few high school friends because we used to listen to his music together. This a shame because his discog is one for the books, and I've listened to a loooooooot of electronic music.

I'd say that's up to him as I'm sure hes able to remain in the current market segment he occupies while still keeping the lights on and food on the table. I personally enjoy his brand right where it is, it's still niche but successful nonetheless.

At least that's how I interpret it for myself and my gender adventure. (For reference, I consider myself Non Binary or vaguely gender fluid, typically sitting right in the middle of the spectrum.)

It works nicely if most of the bpm change occurs when the 1st track is on a low intensity phrase, like the buildup towards the second drop after the first. The sync button works as well, but it's a lot more satisfying to move both tempo sliders at the same time and hear it as it stays in sync."

If you're still curious, Requiem is a gameplay overhaul for Oldrim (I think? Maybe has been updated since for SE but I'm dont think so) that mainly delevels the world. Instead of enemies scaling with the player's level, they now have their own static level. For example, Bleak Falls Barrow becomes a level 10 dungeon if I'm not mistaken, so youd have to work your way up to be able to get through it. Most dungeons and caves are leveled higher so from the start, the strategy is hunting deer, mudcrabs and wolves for skill exp before being able to take on bandits and bigger creatures.

Another fun feature being that damage output for both you and the world is higher. If you were in a fight with an equal leveled bandit youd both have a decent chance at taking out the other in 2-4 swings of a sword. If an equally leveled Bandit Chieftan catches you with a warhammer power attack it's almost guaranteed an insta kill.


There are so many changes itd be impossible for me to list them here from memory but ultimately it makes the game harder in ways that imo arent a pain in the ass. Its makes your decisions more important. Do I try and cross that bridge with a troll on the other side or should I find a longer way around? I'm halfway through this dungeon but there's pack of vampires lurking in the next room; should I abandon the quest and try again when I'm stronger? In normal skyrim that isnt usually an issue.


Requiem, plus the ones you mentioned, TKs Dodge, Inconsequential NPCs, death alternative, then a few mods like deadly dragons, BLEED or whatever it's called and a small tweak in the console for increased fatigue cost + regen speed, and BOOM, you got yourself a copy of The Elder Souls V"

Beatmatch,fjjtrho,t1_fji7d4t,1583411911.0,"For me, I do a lot of long blends, double drops, and dancing to keep myself engaged. I try to stay away from effects just because I know I can butcher a mix by adding an unnecessary flanger lol. I dont really beatmatch my music traditionally, I usually match the incoming track to the tempo of the the current track before dropping it, then move both tempo sliders at the same time while they're playing toward the original bpm of the new track.

I play 140 dubstep mostly, but when I need to beatmatch it's because I'm dropping a 70 bpm track down to 60 so I can easily mix into some 120 bass music, or 70 up to 80 and 85 for some weird dnb related stuff. Otherwise, my incoming track is usually at the same tempo as the one playing so it only comes up 3-5 times in an hour mix."
Beatmatch,fjjt6ih,t1_fjioqu1,1583411380.0,"Wait why not? I mix between 140 to 70, down to a track at 60 then to 120. I've never noticed a difference between halftime and regular tracks other than the auto generated bpm"

Minecraft,fjetn8v,t1_fjeqt37,1583278012.0,"Which is true, however; the minecraft community has adopted the terms Resource Pack, Data Pack, Skin, Plugin, and Mod independently. Even though all of these are most definitely mods by the standard definition, the community has accepted the term Mod to refer to changes in code. As far as I understand it.


It's like, a tomato is a fruit, or whatever it is, yet we refer to it as a cooking vegetable because that's what the majority understand and accept in common conversation."
Beatmatch,fj57v33,t1_fj56r3e,1583026290.0,"The ""mapping"" refers to the controls (buttons, knobs, faders, etc.) on the controller being recognized by the software so that each control has a corresponding function. 

If I wanted to use an Xbox 360 controller on my PC, I'd have to map the buttons to keys on the keyboard, the ""A"" button to the Spacebar or the ""B"" button to the ESC key. 

If you want to use your DJ controller with another program, you'd need to map the controls of the controller to the controls of the software, CUE button on DDJ-400 to the CUE button in the user interface of VDJ or Trim knob on Channel 1 to the trim on the software ."

DestinyTheGame,fixmt5f,t1_fixduym,1582823228.0,"Does it even matter? It's the path of least resistance towards a profitable business. There is virtually no point in expanding on a product/service that continues to generate revenue unless that expansion can be proven to increase/sustain revenue projections.

Management does not care if you, the player, feel satisfied with the service/product provided, they only care about company growth and if the wants/needs of the shareholders are satisfied and that usually correlates to an upward trend in profit.

Upward trend in profit =/= Consumer satisfaction and making changes to the game costs money. Unless the changes made can be proven to increase/sustain profit or reduce costs, there wont be a valuable reason to make the changes.

The potential for this game has most certainly been tapped, it just so happens that this is from the perspective of Bungie's management/shareholders, not the consumer/player."
