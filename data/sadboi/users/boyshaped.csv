edit: 
I'm a young person and have been using google docs since I was 9. I've actually been to conferences with google representatives that showed my class and I how to use google docs, google slides, google forms, etc. I caption youtube videos for fun, so i already do this as a hobby and earning money would be great! I type accurately and fast averaging 95-110 wpm. 

I love writing/listening to economic/political topics and I'm well versed in it as well! So i have no objections. 

I am available into the foreseeable future. I actually have an opening because im finishing up my college class soon and will have free time AND i'm quitting my job at retail for personal reasons.
