Dogtraining,fqnzwso,t1_fqn96br,1589504725.0,"I find this is the most effective. And it keeps my dog from only responding to me when there’s treats in my hand :) we do a sit, shake, or lie down for every single item given to him and a wait for every feeding time. Every time I go through a door and he crowds me, we practice “back up”. A spin is for especially good treats, and “jump up” and “jump down” are practiced with the car and couch all day. I find as long as you clearly communicate what you want, a “session” isn’t needed unless it’s for party tricks that dont involve day to day life :) tbh, in total we probably practice each “trick” about 10-15 times a day without having an actual full blown session. I think when it’s practiced along with the reason you are teaching it sticks a lot more. Still working on “come” outside though....7 month olds amirite?

Edit: and clearly communicate your boundaries all day long! No matter what, don’t let any unwanted behavior slide every minute of the day. Or else they’ll do it behind your back ;)"

Chihuahua,fp209iw,t3_gasdkx,1588252351.0,"Sleepin in the bed with you is usually not recommended as it lends a hand in development of separation anxiety. (And it’s very likely you’ll end up with a bed covered in puppy pee)

I suggest maybe crate training but put the crate in the room with you - where you can hear how the night is going and hear if puppy needs to go potty in the middle of the night. It is going to cry, probably a lot, the first night but stick it out. And the upside to crate training is if he does ever need to be crated as an adult, it won’t terrify him.

Try not to give into crying, it can teach that screaming is a good way to get attention, and there should be far less crying in about a week. 

Otherwise, she’ll probably explore at her own rate. You can fence him in to one part of the house if you’re worried about the new environment, and it helps to keep an eye on him.

Start setting boundaries and learning manners as soon as you get her. Whatever he’s allowed to get away with now, he will continue as an adult. 

Honestly, she should only need something to ride in the car in and a leash. Most vets don’t recommend carrying chihuahuas around a lot - and most of them prefer just walking next to you as opposed to being “handled”. Usually the ones that like to be carried only “like” it because they have anxiety and want constant contact with their owner, which isn’t necessarily good. And they need their exercise too!!

Maybe head over to r/dogtraining for some more advice?"

reactivedogs,foui98f,t3_g9mby5,1588084555.0,"And not all misbehaving is reactivity. Sometimes dogs just get amped on walks or whatever because they’re under stimulated. 

During self isolation times my dog (half high energy working breed) would yank and pull and bark and throw an all out tantrum (including biting) over saying hi to another dog (when he’s never done that prior, he’s trained to sit before greeting) because we haven’t been able to go to the park to get his social needs and exercise out.  I corrected that entirely by scheduling specific play dates with my sisters dog in an unused area of land where they run and play and pretty much just wear each other out. The next couple days he’s pretty much an angel on the leash. The longer he goes without that play date though the worse and worse he can be on the leash. Took me a while to figure out if he was becoming reactive but it was just that he was just as bored as I was being stuck in the house and walking around in the same places. 

Not saying that this is usually the case on here. Most everyone on here has a pretty good grip on what they’re dealing with and how to deal with it. There’s just been a couple of instances I’ve seen where people ask advice for pulling or barking for high energy breeds and everyone instantly goes in for the “reactive” or “aggressive” label instead of first asking if the dog is getting adequate exercise/ adequate socializing.  A dog that’s bored at home is a dog that’s hard to walk on a leash.  

In those cases, the specialized training advice would do a lot less for the dog than a chance to run hard and play hard a couple days a week."

I always struggled with making myself eat, I mean when I was 18 I was 10 pounds underweight because I felt guilty for eating anything other than rice. Sometimes I still miss looking underweight but I am now an average weighted 21 year old and I’m healthy. The one single thing that helped me is I made the active decision to just not give a FUCK who looks at me and why and what they think of MY healthy ass functioning body. Like one day I was just like you know what FUCK this shit, I’ve literally never even MET not ONE single girl who looks like those Instagram models, and I’ve met a lot of **hot** girls. 

Like girl yeah I got a muffin top rn cuz these pants a lil too tight but I also just fireman carried two German shepherds up a flight of stairs at work today (that actually happened, they were scared of the stairs and I needed them upstairs, like, now) like sorry I wanted to get a coffee instead of spending 6 hours at the gym today JESSICA

And by the **fucking** way, half the time men aren’t judging us near as much as we are judging each other. A guy I know once told me that some chick we saw was hot because she had a ponytail. A PONYTAIL. Was she a model? Nope. She was pretty fuckin regular lookin. 

Anyway, you’re probably hot OP. Lotta people would die to have the confidence to just be natural."

reactivedogs,fnr05dd,t1_fnqw0t0,1587176123.0,"To be honest, this response is long as HELL but I’m **not** going to belittle you in any way for having trouble. Dogs can be hard!! Genuinely offering advice that has worked for me in the past as I work with dogs. That said, it’s easier to administer training when you’re THERE and you can see wassup, but I really wanna help!

I’m gonna be honest- I know very little on figuring out car sickness in dogs. I DO know that they do better the closer to the front of the car they are, but that’s because the back of a vehicle usually sways a lot more (speaking from my own car sickness experiences and my own dogs hahaha) I definitely recommend speaking to a vet about car sickness. It could genuinely be anxiety- lots of dogs have honest motion sickness, but way more have issues with car anxiety. It’s a ton of movement and sounds and can be over stimulating causing anxious tummy upset. 

Any chance you could take them to a somewhat secluded area to get their sillies out? I do this with my dog **but** it’s a given with him (very protective) that he rarely goes out of eyeshot of me. I take him to a HUGE park near us (empty, not a dog park) and just let him frickin RUN SON!! While he loves the dog park; it is very very stimulating and having his “alone time” for running seems to be important. Walking him is absolutely horrible when he hasn’t got his sillies out. Pulling out the ass, barking, the works. But if I play fetch with him for 20 or so mins prior, he’s a genuine angel on leash. 

I’ve worked with some labs before and I feel as though this advice applies because they’re both hunting/retrieving breeds: 

Your beagles want a 9-5 job, essentially. Hide and seek  is a fun game! But it’s not enough to satisfy their “find it” drive. I think, finding a wide open space and having them “find” items, (perhaps hiding a toy stuffed with treats) would satisfy their instincts for both hunting and “finding”. Humans have bred them to be working dogs, and when you don’t work them, they can develop behaviors such as excessive barking. If you don’t know an area big enough or your puppies are prone to running way too far away, tennis courts work great. A tennis ball and a secluded court are wonderful.

Alternatively, a VERY fun game for just around the house stuff is to hide treats (for my pitbull, maybe 5-10 as his “find” instincts are relatively low, but for a hound 10-20 healthy treats like beans or eggs or something smelly) around the house, and I’m talkin between cushions, on chairs, “hard” places, for them to sniff out and find. I can’t put too fine a point on how much of a smell drive hounds have. Really HIDE those treats. 

But the “find it” game may not be enough. Play find it once a day (it’s fun for you too to see your babies having fun!) , and let them run off-leash at **least** every other day. Walks on “days off from running free” need to be **long, educational, fun** walks. 

And let me just say. It sounds like tons of work. And it is! Omg, it’s so much. But truely, the outside time or the effort put forth, will make you feel good inside. I suffer from depression and working hard to keep my pup happy has actually helped due to forcing me to go outside or to play games inside. It gives you lots to think, and is a good incentive for being creative. 

I wish you luck! Hounds like beagles are very smart, therefore they know what makes you tick and will use it to their advantage for your ever-so-Desired attention. Don’t get discouraged. Stand your ground. The benefits will be golden."

reactivedogs,fnon34e,t3_g2zpfa,1587129392.0,"I don’t think your beagles are reactive, I think they might be bored! **bored dogs will always bark at everything and pull towards everything**. It’s just so exciting!! 

1) beagles are loud - naturally. If you’re not okay with a lot of barking beagles aren’t the best breed 

2) the genuinely most helpful thing I was ever told  about too much barking was to teach them “speak” and then teach them “quiet”. Definitely do what others in here are saying but knowing the word quiet as a command might help :)

3) some dogs bark at other dogs because they want to meet them. Are they socialized? Do they know how to meet dogs? Do you ever take them running at a park? Dog parks? Like what do you **do** with them? Beagles do not make good “watch tv with me and maybe go for a walk later” dogs. They are born and bred to RUN, HUNT, SNIFF, and most importantly BARK REALLY LOUD. The only beagles I’ve ever met that were lazy are above 12 years in age or too fat to move.

All the special leashes in the world aren’t going to prevent them barking at all the fun things on walks if they’ve never been given a chance to meet and become desensitized to things. 

Just trying to give some alternate advice because it might not be reactivity (it doesn’t really sound like it to me personally, they sound like they feel like they’ve got nothing better to do) I think that gets misdiagnosed a lot. Try more exercise, socializing practices, make walks more fun for them, before trying reactivity tactics."

He’s so used to going out and about to public places with me and I think he’s frustrated that he suddenly is stuck in the house and not meeting fun strangers :/. The tantrums are the same exact ones he throws when I revoke a toy so it feels more like he feels he’s being denied something. And I did forget to mention he acts like this when people stop and talk to him, THATs when he spazzes. If they keep walking so will he. He’s acting freakin exactly like he did at 13 weeks except this time he’s a LOTS bigger. I don’t feel super concerned yet because my sisters puppy did the exact same thing when she turned 7 months, but If you’ve got any pointers on how we can keep practicing good manners with strangers During this I’m all ears!"
