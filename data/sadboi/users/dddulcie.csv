My therapist basically made me feel like I need to leave her if I don’t want to get married. I don’t not want to get married....don’t I get more than a year before I commit everything to someone? I think that’s too simplistic and unfair for my therapist to assume. Of course I am more cautious and analytical than a “normal” person, and I think it’s fair for me to want time, and fair for me to want to take some time to focus on myself. I was in inpatient psych three times last year. I need to pick up the pieces before I hand them to somebody else....
I think that if someone loves me or knows me, they’d know I just move at my own pace and can’t be pressured into something. They’d know that once I’m all in, I’m super in. So that is why I agree that she is ignoring some of my issues and idealizing me."

She is definitely an anxious attachment type. She also has some mommy issues (as I call them) she refuses to address (which is also frustrating). It’s hard because the more anxious she gets, the more avoidant I get. It’s also frustrating because the slightest criticism sends her into a guilt-spiral where she just keeps apologizing and shuts down. Like “can you please put your laundry in the hamper” “I’m sorry! I’m sorry.” “Lol don’t be sorry, I’m not upset.” “You seem really upset”
That type of scenario pushes me to break my boundaries where I’ll just be like “don’t worry about it, I know you’re busy, I shouldn’t have said anything.” When in my head I’m like....oooomg all I asked you to do was pick up your dirty clothes!

It’s like, she cannot trust something that isn’t promised, and I can’t trust something that is. Sorry for ranting. Im just worried I’m in the wrong, and being inconsiderate of her. I hope you’re doing well. Surprised to see another cptsd-er here ❤️"

Agree the Prez didn’t have much to do with this specifically, but he and the federal courts could have put a stop to this. Not arguing with you, it’s just sad and disheartening :/"
CoronavirusUS,fmpl9yt,t1_fmpjrel,1586282841.0,"I think they would’ve. Wisconsin Courts made the decision to keep us at the polls, so I think it’s out of the DNC’s hands...unfortunately."
CoronavirusUS,fmpl205,t1_fmpjheb,1586282730.0,I’m sayin’
CoronavirusUS,fmpl1gz,t1_fmpexiw,1586282723.0,"Jealous. I requested a ballot over two weeks ago, still haven’t received it."
CoronavirusWI,fmpktbu,t1_fmpig4f,1586282610.0,"Honestly, they don’t really have a choice - they’re playing the only part they have in assuring things like this don’t continue to happen.   :("
CoronavirusUS,fmpke55,t1_fmpib8i,1586282397.0,"So you admit this is a problem, that officials were cruel and unsafe with their decision to deny us safe voting conditions. Bless your sweet little heart.

You’d criticize me for voting, you’d criticize me not voting, I’m part of a problem no matter what I do. If you’re not at home today, forced to weigh your safety and health with your civic duty, keep quiet. Hope you’re well."
CoronavirusUS,fmpgyhi,t1_fmpel87,1586280650.0,"You didn’t answer my question. Would you send your family out to vote? Would you be disgusted with the courts? Both federal and state? Because the federal courts upheld the states decision. The federal court’s decision not to extend the deadline for absentee ballots also pushed people to the polls today. The federal court made that decision knowing that the election itself was not being postponed. 

State and supreme courts backed the decision. They refused to move the election date and they refused extending absentee deadlines. I put in a request for a ballot two weeks ago, and still haven’t received it, which is the case for tens of thousands Wisconsin citizens. Evers should have acted sooner, but this was also not his first attempt. None of the attempts came soon enough, I agree with that. Both unethical action AND unethical lack of action will indeed kill people."
CoronavirusUS,fmpfa7f,t1_fmpei9f,1586279801.0,"Yes, but the issue is that absentee ballots are so far behind schedule here, and refusing to push the date forward on those (which WI and US supreme courts agreed to, correct me if I’m wrong) is pushing people to the polls. I requested a ballot two weeks ago, still hasn’t come, so to the polls I go :/"
CoronavirusUS,fmpeezf,t1_fmpe1y4,1586279362.0,Oh absolutely. I’m just pointing out that this specific situation of the polls being open in WI is on the shoulders of the State legislature.
CoronavirusUS,fmpe74m,t1_fmpds5v,1586279251.0,"Tell me how they’re not responsible for this? ...would you send your mom or your dad or your children to the polls right now? 100,000 people voting at a single location?"
CoronavirusUS,fmpds0p,t1_fmpdn0u,1586279035.0,"Agreed, but it wouldn’t have worked, and it would have just opened him up for a ton of DEMOCRACYYY NOT SOCIALISM backlash."
