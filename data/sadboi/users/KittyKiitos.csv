It's a sucky situation and yea, she made a mistake that she already has to pay for every day.  No need to pile on.  At the same time, anytime you can make more space for yourself and others without being stupid is not space you should keep yourself from just because someone else can't go.

If you want to do something out of love, and to help everyone, if there's space that's only yours in the apt. you can offer your sister to use that space when you're out.  If you have a porch, or if there's an outside space that's accessible to her, you can offer to help her get to those places or make the porch into a beach-esque hangout (which could also be fun).

You seem to only recently have a problem with an arrangement you've been fine with the past 5 years.  You call that ""patient"" - but you don't sound like you have that solid of a relationship with your daughter.  You had to start ""paying more attention to her behaviour"" to come to the  insightful/s conclusion that she still leaves the house?  How often do you have heart-to-hearts with her, make a nice meal or enjoy a movie together?

You're her parent.  It's not your obligation to micromanage her life, but it IS your job to dedicate some serious time to listen to her and come up with clear rules and guidance to help her start acting like an adult.  Imagine if you had been ""charging"" her for cell phone, gas money, rent, and setting it aside for her, for 5 years, what she'd have, not only in terms of cash but in terms of work experience.

She's 23 years old with no work history and no education.  That's scary af.  If you want her to get a job YOU need to be her career center, and help guide her through posting on sites and applying to jobs.  You need to help her get started in detail and be clear that no question is too dumb to be asked.  You need to set guidelines that she owes X amount for cell phone, X amount for rent, and it's due by Y day every month.  And you need to have set consequences that can be discussed if/when she doesn't meet those deadlines.

She's obvi at fault for claiming she has depression but not wanting to see someone about it.

1) You are forcing T1 to take on the same role you've assumed in your family, which is why you're in this boat in the first place.  You chose to continue to funnel your success to people other than your children.  Whatever noble goals you had, your children should have come first and foremost.  That's what being a parent means. T1 isnt the one to blame, at all, and to put that on him is a horribly manipulative and cowardly thing to do.  You made your financial choices on your own.  You shouldn't be financially threatening like this.

2) You're making T1's choices about T2.  As a twin myself, this is incredibly, incredibly hurtful.   It is SO hard to maintain your own identity with people lumping you together with someone else your entire life, parents included.   You're tying them together when you should be encouraging him to have his own identity and center decisions that effect his future on himself.

3) You've made T1's choices about you and your finances.  Finances are super important - but there's something clearly going on with T1 and you've failed to reach out to him in a way where he can be open with you about his reasoning, his problems and his choices.  If there is a communication issue its your job as a parent to tune in, listen, support and unblock it.  You're the adult.  At 18, whether the law believes it or not, the human brain is still maturing and there's a lot he still needs to learn.

4)  T1 and T2.  They are people and you couldn't even use their middle names.  I know this is a default way people think about twins - but f* you for not making the effort to show the world that they are unique individual people."

My older sister was earning way, way less in her graduate program than her now husband.  When they moved in together, she still paid rent.  She was upfront with him about her budget when they looked at places, saying she couldn't afford more than x/month, so yes, he paid most of the rent, but she still paid what she could afford.

It's nice you have wealth, that you dont want to burden others.  But you are still in control of your money, and that's not what happens when you get married, without a prenup.

It's a tough situation, for sure.  But you're not just an invited guest - you're part of the bridal party, and that comes with responsibilities.  You should have never gone into this weekend expecting that even half of it will be alone time for you and your BF.  This is first and foremost about your friend and her future husband, and you (and your BF) should be making EVERY effort to make do with the AirBnB, talking openly with your friend about your options.  My older sister hates sharing space - she's slept on the floor of hotel rooms in the closet to get alone space.

That being said, you are right about making sure your SO is there.  It would be wrong of your friend to ask you to such an important event in her life and exclude someone so important in yours.  The thing that gets me though it that it looks like your friend never told you he couldn't come.

Bottom Line - TALK TO YOUR FRIEND AND TRY TO WORK IT OUT WITH HER, AND FOR HER.  If you can't, it doesn't seem like you guys are good enough friends to warrant being in the bridal party."

1) Women are half of the population.  If you feel like this is ""all women,"" it could be in the way you perceive them.  There have been documented studies that show people of both genders will believe women and men have contributed equally to a discussion, when in fact women have only spoken a fraction of the time men have.  Comments out of women will be perceived as combative or argumentative, while the same from a man will be seen as constructive and good insight.

2) The less power you have, the more likely it is people will exercise authority over you.  Again, most people aren't even conscious of it.  But society gives your brother more power than you, and that trickles down to ""well, it just doesn't feel right to keep your brother on the same curfew.""

3) Women are taught to care for everyone - men are taught that they don't have to.  Your mom and aunts are by default the ones who have to take care of driving you, feeding you, etc - if your dad or uncles do a fraction of what their wives do, it's above and beyond.  And yet these men also have the authority to override everything your mom and aunts put work into.  Your dad can be the cool parent because, typically, he gets full parent credit for doing much less of the work of being a parent.  He can take four year old you out for a cotton candy binge, because guess who's going to be scraping the vomit off of the carpet at midnight?  Mom.

I still don't get my mom in a lot of ways - and I always had a much better relationship with my dad.  One thing I hated was how my mom would always want my room to be ""presentable"" and she'd clean things before I was even done using them.  And it took being quarantined for it to dawn on me how much work she put in, all by herself, to make sure we didn't have to deal with ants during ant season or moths eating our clothes, that we were never out of dishes, that we always had homecooked food on the table.  My husband and I used to eat out so much we didn't have to deal with the work we do now - and now we aren't even a family of 5.  And she never expected a thank you, she only complained when we were jerks about it.  We still have our issues - but I don't blame her for feeling overwhelmed and not being perfect."

And if she doesn't see that shes not a good friend.

You're not asking her to change herself - you didn't invite her into the situation.  Is it right that you both can't be out and proud with your family? Of course not.  But YOU cant even be yourself with them, why are you TA for explaining that she can't either without hurting you?"

It'd be really nice if you found an ally in this - but it's most likely not going to be among AF's friends.  People talk, people slip, and these are AF's friends - there's a reason they stick around her, and even if there's only a little loyalty, that's more than they have to you or FDIL.

If you don't feel good just playing it safe, ask FDIL directly if there is anyone she DOES trust out of these people.  She and your son are the point people on this.

When it comes down to it, if they had a good relationship with FDIL, that's who they'd be reaching out to for information. They wouldn't need that much from you anyway - so if the questions go beyond your personal role in this, it's fishy."
