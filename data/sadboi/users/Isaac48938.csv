mentalhealth,eyxisxg,t3_cz9a5l,1567554415.0,I felt this on another level. Except it comes in waves. Sometimes worse than others. I just sit here like damn. Great life I have huh

But we can’t be together and there isn’t a moment of my day where I’m not thinking about it. Sure going out with friends will get it off my mind for a short period of time. But then agian I cant just go out 24/7. So it’s usually really heavy on my mind .
