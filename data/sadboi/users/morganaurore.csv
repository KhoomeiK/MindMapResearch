penpals,fkjjx55,t3_fips8h,1584248239.0,"Hello Syd, my name is Aurore! (Pronounced like Aurora without the “a”). My current favorite is my Green Aventurine. I went to a local witch shop and picked out what best suited what I’m attempting to manifest right now. I also got carnelian, white jade, green calcite, fluorite, blue calcite, and blue lace agate. I’m very new to all this (crystals and rocks) and have been casually practicing tarot for about a year! :)"

SuicideWatch,fkjgc4p,t3_fil327,1584245078.0,"But wouldn’t it be so much more satisfying to defy the odds? You can move away, no one would know you and you could start fresh. Trust me I understand mental illness and thinking you don’t have a way out. But wouldn’t it be so satisfying to just start over completely? You can try as many times as you want. And you never know if death will be eternal bliss, torture, or nothingness."
SuicideWatch,fkjfe4n,t3_fir9m2,1584244308.0,"It’s not okay for them to say that and then not work towards helping people who are suicidal. Like, you want people to keep living, but don’t want to offer them support, care, and something to value in life? It’s selfish to want people you mistreat to keep living just because you know you’d feel guilty if they killed themselves."
SuicideWatch,fkjemso,t3_figg38,1584243705.0,"I have been going through pretty much the same as you for years (F 20) developed OCD at 9 and have never been able to control my emotions or thoughts. I was was happier just thinking I was crazy but when I was finally diagnosed I knew I was just shit at maintaining myself and my mental health. Everyday ends with me fantasizing suicide. When I would hurt myself I felt so shameful and it just drove my friends away because they didn’t know how to approach me about it. So I make these goals I have to reach before I do it. Like, I don’t want to leave my mom with debt so I have to pay off my student loans first. Or I don’t want to leave my pet on anyone not expecting it so I’d have to find her a new owner first. So on and so on. I’m sick of being a burden, so it’s like I procrastinate with these tasks so my death won’t be a burden either."
