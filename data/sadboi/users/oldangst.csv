EdAnonymousAdults,fr2gwby,t1_fr0606w,1589837073.0,"Thank you so much, it's improving but still lingering. I'm going to try and get myself to eat smaller meals, I just lost control from the hunger and couldn't make the connection that I was actually full. One day at a time ðŸ’™"
EdAnonymousAdults,fr2gpxr,t1_fr0akyl,1589836985.0,"I definitely tried Tums but it didn't help. It's slowly getting better but yeah, for as long as it keeps happening I'm assuming it's just indigestion - just the worst I've ever had in my life lol"
EUGENIACOONEY,fqzxqww,t1_fqyejwy,1589778078.0,"This is exactly what I deal with and where I'm at. I can't sleep. But I'm exhausted all the time and want nothing more to sleep. I never lost my period. My resting heart rate is normal. Sometimes I'm in pain, sometimes I'm not. It's like Russian roulette most days, I never know what's going to happen. Sometimes I stand up and my vision goes dark, I've never passed out, but I've definitely ran into a couple things unintentionally while walking and I was never uncoordinated. My fingers started turning purple. I'm a POC so people may not notice, but I have. Toes and fingers are freezing a lot. Until they're not and they're on fire 10 minutes later. Its almost summer and it was almost 85 degrees the other day. I couldn't get warm. I sat on my balcony in a hoodie and long sleeves for an hour until I had to get another jacket and my slipper socks. Random shortness of breath. Sitting in bed or on the couch hurts. Never really comfortable. I've bobbed up and down between a bmi of 15-17 for the last 6 months. Really sat at 16.5 for the most part, and I've dealt with this for years and gone by but it's catching up. I've never had as many problems as I've had recently. But who knows how long some things have been there that I wasn't really aware of until someone else mentioned it, and I really just feel like I'm being dramatic and started shutting up about it, and it's now like... I've gotten used to everything. I don't really think about it anymore. EDs suck."

AskDocs,fk6vvun,t1_fk6vgbm,1583918508.0,Thank you for responding - the nosebleed definitely scared me from doing it since. I purchased some saline wash and have been using that following that as well - hopefully at some point I can get to an ENT! Thanks again.
EDAnonymous,f4pkw2e,t1_f4pj95w,1571736390.0,"""i'm so fucking angry cause i actually don't deserve this disorder but i stil think that i do.""

This. Just. Broke. My. Brain. That's the feeling I have that I couldn't identify."
EDAnonymous,f3sk9p4,t3_dhvqmx,1571104207.0,"Sooo, I thought the same thing up until like two days ago because I took pictures and my stomach just keeps.. ugh. Of course everyone is like ""it's water weight and comes off"" and I mean yeah I have ED brain but literally it wasn't coming off. I had been going to the bathroom, so I thought I was just gaining.. but I think I have IBS or something because I took some lax the other day and went, but then I took more the next day and well... My stomach no longer looks like it has been.. I didn't know I was so constipated because I was still having movements. I thought my weight was just up because of a fucked metabolism which is also still possible, but I learned that all the weight I put on wasn't all fat. Just something else to consider if you haven't."
Anxiety,f3aguwi,t1_f3abyyy,1570772710.0,"Thank you ðŸ’™, I'm trying my best to relax a little bit and take comfort into the fact that it is a small class and short presentation and my PI will do everything to help me prepare more (hell, I feel like she would be the one to just do it for me if I said all of what I said to her) and know I'll feel better when it's over (then it's anxiety for conferences in the spring and defending my thesis in the summer). I haven't figured out how to let go I guess because I'm still hanging on to previous times I presented and it didn't go well. Everytime I space out completely and talk really fast and out of order and shake like a leaf. It's incredibly annoying and embarrassing. I never feel accomplished or anything as after it's done, I'm just glad it's done ðŸ˜‚"
Anxiety,f3aggcp,t1_f3adc7x,1570772238.0,"I have it all outlined but I haven't actually talked it out yet. I'll try that. 
Anytime I present for example, my supposed to be 15 minute presentation, I'll have a PowerPoint with enough words I can read from it if I had to but short enough that it's not a cluttered mess and life story but I just get so panicked on top of forgetting everything I wanted to say, reading goes out the window too. 20 minutes turns into an adrenaline rush of 5 minutes of taking so fast it's incoherent and I miss points that needed to be talked about since it was on the slide. That and physical things like my heart beating so hard I hear it in my ears, also so fast that my watch thinks I'm working out, visible and audible shaking that people say no one would notice in other people, but it's bad enough on me that I've been called out about it by many different people. If i hold a paper, it looks like it's flapping around in the wind it's that bad. Standing makes me feel like I'm going to pass out especially with the hyperventilating."

EDAnonymous,f34n19g,t1_f33rgfn,1570656693.0,They did it without telling me they got it. I didn't want to be rude.
EDAnonymous,ewyaa0d,t3_cqouq5,1565877584.0,"that was literally the exact same thing that happened to me a few years ago, the guy took one look at me when i started talking about my ED and said i looked healthy at least. so i walked the fuck out and never came back."
EDAnonymous,ewy8x1r,t3_cqk3e4,1565876919.0,Im in the south and constantly set my heat to like 80 degrees in the morning and then at some point im dying of heat stroke and set it to 74 but only for like an hour and then back to heat lmao.
EDAnonymous,ewwom8l,t1_ewwbp19,1565831606.0,It makes me more hungry.
EDAnonymous,ews5dri,t3_cpuzl6,1565720527.0,oh god that happens to me when i take it and i end up destroying the bathroom like 8-12 hours later when i forgot i took it and it doesnt stop for a while lmao
EDAnonymous,ews517c,t1_ewrmr7l,1565720323.0,"Even being underweight I somehow still just look fit to everyone. People compliment me and say how jealous they are and say things like ""what are you a size 2?"" (no, thats too big, but i guess i dont look it) or ""wow I wish I had your metabolism""  when i finally break down and eat something like fries in front of them. It definitely makes me feel like I am not sick."

I like adding cinnamon or cocoa powder and vanilla to it but while i got full of it it for like a hour at first i was always hungry shortly after."
