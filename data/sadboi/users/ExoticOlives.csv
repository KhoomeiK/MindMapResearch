One is called The Giver, and one is called Scythe. I think they are both pretty fantastic books, but the giver is a pretty short book. Scythe has three books in the series and they are all pretty decent in length.

Its still kind of hard to understand magnetic fields but i understood your words about them like this: a neutron star produces two types of particles with different charges that can change based on your point of relativity, so a particle can be charged positively based on a certain relativity and can be charged negatively based on a different relativity. How do charges change based on relativity? What can the charges be relative to? (as in can a spaceship or another particle or even the star itself be a point of relativity?) I dont know if i worded these questions quite right, sorry! Im still really new to astronomy (like 10th grade astronomy class new) so im still wrapping my head around the terms like magnetic field and time dilation.

With that being said it is still a wise idea to consume in moderation, as with all foods. Everyone has a different BMR specific to them, so you might need more apples than me to sustain yourself throughout the day. Put it this way: you have an apple worth 100 calories, and you have a cup of apple juice worth 100 calories. Which do you think would be better for you? Probably the apple. The apple will keep you energised for longer whereas the juice will only be a short burst of energy before you need more, so in a given amount of time you will eat less food if you ate the apple, and more food if you drank the juice because you will need more energy after that juice is gone.
