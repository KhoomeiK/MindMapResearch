She came out to me when she knew I was married to a woman. She never wanted me to share it with the others tho. She ended up on hospice, still on her death bed calling her partner of 20+ years her ‚Äúsister‚Äù to the doctors and nurses. Broke my heart."

Today is my first day with the focalin and I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt see much improvement but I am also on 10mg maybe that‚Äôs not enough? She did say adults sometimes don‚Äôt do as good on the focalin as the adderall, that they react better to the salts? Something to do with the binding agent of dopamine.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,eqqdfgr,t1_eqqd3iv,1560218377.0,Understandable
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,eqkxzvw,t1_eqkuduz,1560133490.0,I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs more the appraisal differences - conventional they say is easier to get through compared to FHA which my agent says is false. And then there is the other aspect of financial situations - conventional is often for those with higher credit scores and obviously more money saved up for down payment which can show more financial responsibility compared to the FHA where credit scores don‚Äôt have to be as high and the person may not be as financially responsible. It sucks to have them view it like that tho.
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,eqkldc8,t1_eqkjdn4,1560125793.0,Yeah we are gonna look around for hopefully a lender with a lower interest rate for the conventional 97.
