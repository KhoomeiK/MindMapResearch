BPD,fj2isb8,t3_fb1q3c,1582944745.0,"I can relate but in a sense that I USED to exhibit classic BPD symptoms in that I would become obsessive and push people away, or freak out/lash out on people when things didn't work out and have literally no control over my emotions. I spent the best part of a year thinking that I had overcome my BPD but my most recent ""relationship"" showed me that I've actually become somewhat of a quiet borderline as I held back on communication every time my thinking patterns screamed abandonment as I didn't want to push him away but I instead did so much internal damage and resorted to things like self-harm but without the attention seeking element that used to be present. Things didn't work out in the end anyway (for his own personal reasons, nothing to do with me) which makes it even more frustrating because I know how detrimental the internalising was to my wellbeing."
BPD,fiomb8a,t3_f5jpyg,1582586024.0,"Handled a breakup really well (so far lol). Was seeing a guy for a month and a half, he basically soft ghosted me for the last 2 weeks, then told me on Friday that he wasn't ready for anything serious but still wanted to hang out if I did. Tonight he told me he kissed his ex at a party on Saturday and realised he's not over it and isn't ready for anything at all, I didn't respond but I also haven't blocked him or lashed out or anything. I'm frustrated bc I brought up the fact he hadn't been single long when we first got involved and he said he was over it and ready to move on and now all of a sudden he's just processing it but the main thing is that I've not freaked out or blown up at any point, I'm hurting but I feel kinda in control."
BPD,fibf82l,t1_fiauxhi,1582320699.0,"I ended up just doing it because I owe it to myself if anything. He hit back about how he needs to take things slow and isn't ready for anything serious because he's still kinda processing stuff from his breakup last year and shit that he's pushed down for the last 5 years but is still very much into me and wants to keep hanging out but doesn't wanna fuck me about so understands if I'd rather stop seeing him...

I think his version of single is focusing on himself, not sleeping around or seeing other people as he can't physically sleep with someone without an emotional connection and our mutual friend told me he's a very monogamous/one girl type guy. I guess the next step is figuring out if I can be in a casual no-label type thing and see where it goes or if I should just move on even tho I don't wanna return to my version of being single which involves sleeping about and not forming real connections with people lol"
BPD,fhcaa2v,t3_f2bwc7,1581459385.0,"I don't start drinking but I've just self harmed for the first time in months because I feel so horribly isolated right now and my FP (the guy I've been seeing since new year, things have started to get pretty serious) hasn't spoken to or texted me since we parted ways yesterday morning. we've not gone that long without talking since things started between us so I can't help thinking it's something I've done."
BPD,fgqejv1,t1_fgq8aoa,1581022658.0,I know that he's staying at a friend's tonight so I understand that he's probably distracted by them but we've also not arranged what time I'm coming through at tomorrow yet and in my head if he really wanted to see me tomorrow then he would at least be messaging me to sort that out before I go to bed tonight? It's gonna take me 3 hours to get there so I'd rather plan in advance than be leaving the house whenever he messages me tomorrow to ask my plans so I'm getting irritated that if he can't even reply to an inside joke then is he even likely to reply to me trying to sort tomorrow's plans. So frustrating :(

BPD,fdzfqhl,t3_en86rh,1578789784.0,"Literally! Going! Through! This! Rn!

I was talking to my mum the other day and literally said that getting feelings for someone is both the best and worst thing ever. It's so exciting feeling so strongly for someone and enjoying their presence so much, getting to know them and physically be with them is exhilarating. But at the same time, every silence, every message that's read and not replied to, every ambiguous phrase is taken out of context and overanalysed. I was convinced that the new guy I'm seeing had changed his mind about me because he barely spoke to me for 2 days and it turned out that he was just feeling really depressed. 

Fucking BPD"

BPD,fcylv6a,t1_fcx93br,1578082410.0,"thank you... I'm already getting upset because he's not texted me since 11:30am even though there's probably some reasonable explanation like he fell asleep after work or something because he had to get up super early this morning. At least I'm better at ""playing it cool"" now than in the past so I haven't attempted to message him asking why he's not replying of anything. It's just hard coping with the intense emotions."

I started a conversation with my mum the other day with ""I know it's probably not true, but...."", She made me repeat the start of my sentence as if trying to prove that I know this stuff is all in my head but it still doesn't make it any easier to challenge at times.

 I know from having conversations with some of my friends that their mental health is suffering a little bit right now too, I guess I wouldn't be surprised if they were wanting to back off a little bit right now because they know that I'm struggling at the minute too and can't really deal with my problems on top of theirs. I'd completely understand that too, I guess it's just the not knowing that I struggle with."

BPD,fbly8s1,t3_eduxig,1576973417.0,"I don't think there's a correlation between sexuality and BPD but I have struggled with figuring out my sexuality over the years i.e. I started questioning it and experimenting with it when I was ~16, when I was 19 I slept with a woman for the first time and ended up throwing a ""coming out"" party because I was positive that I was bisexual and now at 23 years old I'm confused and unsure again i.e. the thought of being with a woman again makes me feel kinda uncomfortable and weird and I'm not sure I'm into it so like... the unstable sense of identity thing I get but I don't think there's a direct correlation between bisexuality and BPD."
BPD,fbjycac,t3_edp6ut,1576941975.0,Pretty sure it's to do with the unstable sense of self aspect of BPD and also kind of similar to the FP attachment thing.

I haven't experienced it from intense emotions but have tried ketamine and it's like you're floating way above yourself and your brain is in a different place. On the other hand, depersonalisation is more like feeling that your life is a movie and that you don't actually exist outside of your own perception of yourself."

We always end up at after-parties after a night out which involve staying up all night, making the shop at 10am for more alcohol then drinking right through into the day. Last time I did this, I slept with one of my good friends (who is seeing a very lovely girl so I feel terrible even tho they're not in an official relationship), I lost my glasses, spent a ridiculous amount of money and managed to leave my phone and charger at my friends house. Oh and when I had sex with my friend it happened outside by the bins and his sister's neighbor caught us (: I get into fucking stupid situations like this all the time when I stay out for more than a night so it's time to sort my shit out."

It's frustrating as he's definitely flirted with me in the past but honestly it was such a relief to get it off my chest! You just have to remember that the worst that'll happen is that he's not interested, but then what? It's better to get the answer than to wind yourself up thinking about it, best case scenario is that he is into you and you can take it from there.
