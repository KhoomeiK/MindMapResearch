Therefore, you are truly not kind or nice no matter what anyone says. You are selfish. To be selfish is one of the worst things you can do. It shows you are arrogant and self-centered.

The only thing that could be considered AP Stats level would be the fact that I used geometric random variables. Even then, I calculated expected counts, which is still from AP Stats, instead of probability for geometric random variables, which I was planning to do, but it wouldn‚Äôt make sense as for calculating probability for geometric random variables, it would ask for the probability that a specific number of trials would have be run until a success is achieved and it wouldn‚Äôt make sense. For example, P(X<10) asks for the probability that it takes less than 10 trials before getting a success so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to put it in the post as a very large amount of probabilities (as opposed to one probability) could be asked because I could say P(X>3), P(X<4), P(X>7), P(X<6), etc. It would be impossible to put every single geometric random variable probability in the post so I kept the statistics calculated to things that there would only be one statistic for.
