I was at Lyon going west at 4:10 and  there was so much shoving to get on a packed train that is was dangerous. They should have straight up closed the platform to people trying to get on to prevent it. Someone is going to get hurt, and then they are going to be shocked and blame the riders. 

Preemptive measures, a shocking proposal -_-"

fiddleleaffig,et9tlv7,t3_caluqd,1562605098.0,"Hey! It sounds like you are trying lots of different things to make this plant happy; moving it back and forth, watering more and less, feeding it more and less etc. It shows how much you care about making it happy, but all this change might be your problem. I have found that fiddles love to have consistency, and like to be left alone mostly. The go through stress when their environment changes at all, and will drop leaves and throw temper tantrums. Right now it seems like the light, watering, drafts, stress, dust on the leaves, or food could all be an issue, and its hard to figure out which when they have all changed so much.   
I would recommend the same thing you do when you skin breaks out, pair everything back to the minimum and build up to find the problem/solution. My recommendation would be to; 

1) Pick a spot with decent indirect light, and no drafts from air vents or windows. Leave it there for the next 6 months or so to give it a fair shot of acclimating to the level of humidity, temperature and light in that spot. (the spot you picked sounds like a good one!)

2) Then, I agree with the other responses, finger check the soil to determine when to water. When the soil is dry up to your second knuckle, water until it drains out the bottom. Make sure to empty the drainage tray so they aren't sitting in the water. 

3) When you water it take the time to gently wipe down the leaves with a damp cloth to ensure they can breathe properly. 

4) give it 2-3 months to acclimate to this routine before adding in another step. then you can trouble shoot. 

With everything you try after that you can test whether the plant improves or gets worse with the added step of care you are providing. This is when, one by one, i would try the following 

\-  Misting it every couple of days and see how that effects it. If the plant loves it, you can always look into getting a humidifier, or moving other plants closer to it to increase the humidity.   
\- add fertilizer that has a 3-1-2 ratio at a VERY diluted amount when you water. 

\- adjusting blinds/brightness of the spot it is in. 

and anything else you are suggested. I know they are high maintenance plants, but once you figure them out with slow consistency, they are so rewarding!   
Good Luck!!"

ottawa,epin5cx,t3_buolgu,1559241106.0,"I have lived in the Byward Market, Sandy Hill, St Laurent and now live beside the Herongate community centre. Out of all those neighbourhoods the one where i felt the least safe walking alone at night ( as a young woman) was definitely the Byward market. 

That being said Ottawa is a safe city and violent crime that is committed by and against strangers is very unlikely, even in neighbourhoods with higher crime rates.   
The reality of crime is that it effects people from lower socio-ecnomoic backgrounds more than those from higher ones, regardless of neighbourhood. 

Something I think about when thinking of why we are afraid of a neighbourhood; are we afraid that crimes will happen to us there, or; Are we afraid of seeing the effects of poverty?"
