musicproduction,fqwfuh4,t3_gl9fzn,1589702915.0,"Andrew huang and his videos on the basics of music really helped, but as the other guy said most of it is learning by doing, if you dont know how to do something google it, or check for communities, maybe on discord, if you can't find your answer on google or youtube, even though youtube has a tutorial for almost anything, sometimes you just dont know how somethings called or how to ask other than in a longer explanation.

I could also recommend the youtuber 'in the mix' for other basics, even though he uses FL studio, but in the description of his currently newest video you can find a discord server for starters with wonderful and helpful music producers, who love to talk about production etc, which would maybe be a good place to ask any questions you have.

Also how to make music really depends on the style you want to go for, but to understand and start the process maybe go for something basic first, as in, make a beat, or make a melody, and then add elements you find fitting etc, try to get to a point where you can let the song guide you instead of you just putting into the program whats in your head.

Basics of a song most of the time are melody, beat, chords, and bass, maybe look up how to make one of those after checking the videos from andrew, if you really want to look at guides, but i do recommend the 'just do, and if you dont know how to make a sound, google it' :)

Good luck and keep it up, music production is a really long but really rewarding process and fun as hell once you get a bit into it!"

solipsism,fqvxm77,t3_gkw3tv,1589687514.0,"Lots of good things in here, what kind of helps me is everytime i ask myself if anythings real or if i start theorizing i check out actual science, theres quite a few good youtube channels that help you understand more about what the universe is and how it works, etc.
The thing is even if we were in a simulation, it doesnt really change anything but the fact that it's a simulation, no? we can still experience things the same way we did before etc, so it doesn't really actually change anything, but it's still a fascinating thing to think about! i can recommend videos from kurzgesagt, like 'the egg' or their video on if anything is real, they kind of helped me a ton to get into understanding anything, and the more you understand the more secure you feel within your spot in reality i feel like, let me share some links from some cool youtubers that provide amazing content and kind of help coping with this 'existential crisis', for me at least.

https://youtu.be/L45Q1_psDqk
This one helped alot, since it gave a very plausible countertheory to solipcism, which got me out of the 'everything MUST be fake' but got me more to a  'everything COULD be fake, probably is but it doesnt really change much.'

https://youtu.be/tlTKTTt47WE
Not really a very scientific video, but a beautiful theory about the universe beautifully shown

https://youtu.be/tlTKTTt47WE
Kurzgesagt on if anything is real, dont really remember excatly what is said in it but i do remember it easing my mind alot.

https://youtu.be/8kX62n6yNXA
And this guy, exurbia, might be one of my favorite if not my favorite youtuber of all time, what he does in his videos is that he helps you find and understand this existential crisis you're experiencing and almost completely removes it, or makes it way easier to cope with it. Also makes you feel like existence is actually a lucky thing to experience, and much more honestly. amazing guy.

other than that talking to a therapist can never hurt imo, even if you think that you're not 'mentally hurt' enough or some shit like that, imo alot of people could really live life up to its fullest potential if they tried seeing a therapist once or twice.

and a small tip at the end, try to get into science  a bit at least, its literally our way of trying to learn the language universe fluently, and its fascinating af :) good luck out there"

Feeling like everyone else is doin alright, and got life figured out and feeling like that one clumsy goofball who just can't figure out anything on his own.

But a friend of mine who i talked to about this thought woke me up quite a bit in telling me that literally almost nobody has life figured out, or knows what they really want to do. I don't know the percentage rn but there's also a really high probability of people completely changing what they're doing in life at least 2 times, so dw too much about finding the right part right away.

Also finals approaching are really scary as well, have my own set of finals in a few months and I can't say I'm excited as well, but I very much you'll manage and pull through it somehow :)

Also about the drivers license, I don't plan on getting one before i need it. This might be a bit too zoomer of a perspective, but sometimes i feel like not using a car as much as you can is a good thing to help the environment with, which is struggling alot atm as everyone knows :') I plan to move to a country like Japan where public travel is so advanced compared to western countries, and really appeals to the idea of never getting a car at all. If i do return to europe though I'll most likely get a driving license just to get around easier. That said don't feel pressured by things you don't 100% need or want, everything at your own pace and you'll succeed just as much as you would trying to rush things you don't really want to do :)

Hope you'll be alright and good luck with your finals!!"

And then first i had this crazy thought of how a soundwave of a drop looked like and if youre really skilled you can make a 'drop' as in dubstep drop just out of that sound, which fascinated me there lol.

Then i started thinking a bit deeper and shit got weird, as i imagined the soundwave i saw that it started, but also ended after a bit, like a normal soundwave, and then i got the thought that maybe the universe is the same. Big bang you know, so i thought that there's a really big explosion which split itself up into the universe, but will also end and restart at some point, like a loop. and what happened then felt like i was thrown out of my body, got looped through the entire universe over and over and oh boy, it felt like dying over and over which made me panic.

Later i found out that the universe might actually be infinite, meaning anything you do could not be as meaningless as we imagine at all, since it can have infinite consequences on the universe if you think about. theres different theories, like the universe is a big organism that's still growing and we're part of. I recommend checking out the video 'the egg' from Kurzgesagt!

Not to mention my only close friends back then i could only contact online, so not having wifi for months at a time didn't make that much easier.

selfharm,fnj0hra,t3_g1xcsp,1586989669.0,"It'll most likely help you if you genuinely think it could help you, and if you're ready to trust a professional and for the experience in general.

It most likely won't help you if someone else tells you 'you should go to therapy!' even though you believe you're fine.

If you're actually improving that's awesome, and that you (probably, considering your subscription to this sub) feel shitty sometimes sucks alot, but neither of those mean that you HAVE TO see a therapist or that you're not 'feeling bad enough' to see one.

If you feel like and you think it can help you in a way go for it, worst that can happen is that nothing changes and you'll keep improving steadily, just venting off to someone else that are maybe not your parents can do wonders as well though. If theres no one like that and you do indeed feel shit feel free to DM but ye, thats my point of view on this.

I also genuinely believe that if going to a therapist would not be considered as 'Help for the crazy' but rather as 'a little positive push in the right direction for anyone', which it is honestly, alot of people, even ones that have only ""small"" problems could have a ton of positive benefits, if open to the experience.

If you do want shorter videos though (i didnt watch the full thing yet as well lol) i do recommend things like composerily, and in general, if you just search things like ""how to do a bassline"" or ""how to do a melody"" you'll find super useful stuff most of the time :)

Also big tip, which makes the whole process just so much more fascinating, as you learn and improve try to really listen to the songs you like, break them down into their own pieces as good as you can and try to recreate them in your head, or try to think of things you don't know how to make and look them up! The better you get at producing the more you'll hear in each song, and it's like rediscovering all the songs you love again, it's really cool :)"
musicproduction,fn9dn7n,t3_g0ezgb,1586768897.0,"My best advice is to just immerse yourself a bit in the whole topic. A big motivator on how to actually start producing is Andrew Huang for example, personally i also like composerily, or eliminate, who started a channel recently, who also uses FL studio, and it's just really cool and kinda helpful to see the whole process.

Other than that it's literally just learning by doing, don't think too much about ""but what if i do it wrong? what if i learn it wrong? what if it sucks?"" but rather just try to start making literally anything, a melody, a bassline, a beat, and go from there, and if you don't understand how to do something search for it on youtube and most of the times there will be a tutorial.

Oh and also most likely nothing you make at the start will sound like anything your favorite producers make, since they also practiced and produced years to get where they are, which sounds scary at first, but once you do startout the progress over weeks is clearly visible and so satisfying to look at really. If you do love music it's such a fun and amazing experience to just create something that is fully yours, you know?

Don't let yourself get demotivated by the overflow of information and try to do one thing after another, don't rush anything but also just do it really, best you can do, good luck :)

also what i found really cool to watch was fox stevensons stream 2 weeks ago, where he produced a track from scratch while explaining everything, might be cool to check out as well, even if you don't use the DAW he's using.

self,flg4z8c,t3_foleq8,1585130849.0,"Same boat man, but I feel like i can get used to this, being quite the introvert myself, just getting up whenever you want is a dream for me :')

Maybe find a hobby to keep yourself occupied, maybe play a video game or read a book you never got to finish, things like this, I myself am currently playing alot of monsterhunter world, has about 200-300 hours of really well made gameplay on its own to just get to lategame with the dlc, but once I'm done with that I'm afraid I'll get quite bored as well, maybe I'll get into a minecraft modpack or something, can also recommend that if you never tried one, those kill a shitton of time and are super fun to play!

If you do have the money and are interested maybe get into music production? Buy a program for it like FL Studio or Ableton and try stuff, it's even more fun than i thought honestly, if you're interested in music of course. I feel like now that we have all this time it's definitely a good time to get into something that you never did because ""time just didn't give"", learning a new language maybe, or anything like that :)

Good luck on your Isolation man, feel free to hit me up whenever it gets a bit too lonely, i definitely feel that as well :')"
LSDTripLifeHacks,fle2c17,t3_fo4sx4,1585076276.0,"Don't feel the need to do it, but it's also like theres nothing better to do sometimes, so why just do nothing when you can trip yk, sometimes you learn about yourself as well.
And i love going outside for the first time after a trip as well, everything looks so much more alive and colorful again :')"

self,fk6wgwz,t1_fk6vikl,1583919251.0,"I stopped crying a long time ago as well, even if i want to express the negativity for myself, to cope with it maybe, i just can't. What I can tell you though, is, that whatever you did when you were 13 years old isn't your fault for sure, and that you're definitely not at fault for getting something like cancer. I regret alot of things when i was younger and feel guilty for that as well, like my hips still looking pretty messed up after around 5-6 years of not cutting stillq, but i think we're both looking at the situation a bit through the lens there :') I for sure, and you probably as well have been in horrible circumstances making us do these things in hope of feeling better, or something like that.
Hope we can still properly cope with our past and look forward to the future, and especially that you'll be able to experience one"

Just hope you'll make it through, nobody deserves to die by something like cancer, and big props to you for taking it like this, i dont even know if i could, even with the suicidal thoughts I've been having for years now :')"

nasusmains,fk1nm99,t1_fk1nfms,1583783287.0,"same, remember back in silver i used to watch every teemo gameplay that i've lost lane against since it frustrated me so much, and kept analyzing thinking my smol silver brain could get anything out of it back then, here i am today barely losing to any teemos, but if i do, oh boy, the frustration still burns :')"
