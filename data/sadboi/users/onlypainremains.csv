I think, in the end, she already told people she was willing to use the idol for someone. She especially said this to Denise before tribal. She just wanted 'to make a move' and didnt think it through in the chaos that tribal was.
She was hoping it would just work out somehow (like if Michelle voted with them and Sarah group split it 4-2 plus Kim played it on Tyson, Sophie would have gone home. But that's a lot of IFs).

It was an attempt to build a resume and a wrong move. I hope she can recover."

I agree with that and I think it's psychologically cruel. It stops the contestants (and viewers!) from having closure after being voted out. They sit there, starving, for long days, with nothing to do but hope they might still get  back in and win the game when most of them just won't.
