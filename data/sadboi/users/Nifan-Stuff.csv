Thinking that basically everything it's relative and not allowing other interpretations, it's also closed minded.
If not, how do you know that I'm closed minded, who says I am?
Don't you understand, no one wants to talk with someone that explains everything with... Well, wHo saHy wHats baaD?"".
Because that mentality does not allow us to debate, talk, discuss or even question anything.
