Anxiety,ew5eya4,t3_cmxx05,1565134629.0,"When you're lying down to sleep you can't help but be more susceptible to thinking about whatever it is that is causing you anxiety at this point in time. If you can try to prempt the anxiety by talking or writing about how you feel and why you believe you are feeling it an hour or so before you intend to sleep. Otherwise, you could always try watching something quietly so that it can gently relax you to sleep. Nights can be some of the hardest times, not least because everyone else is asleep and so it can make you feel quite lonely."
Anxiety,ew4x9ve,t3_cmrwyo,1565120438.0,"Texting is the only thing that brings up my anxiety every time! I've managed to over-text, under-text, form exclusively essay long messages, and act so eager that I've been told to go sort my life out. I'm truly terrible at texting, but face-to-face or on the phone I have no problems at all and form connections with almost everyone I meet.  


My anxiety is driven by the uncertainty of messaging and by filling in the blanks when I don't know how the other person feels. The only advice I can give is that if you enter any social interaction, by text or in person, with the expectation to fail or act in some strange way then it is lmore ikely that you will succeed in making that come true."
Anxiety,ew3e9ao,t1_ew37xem,1565074616.0,"I think this is my favourite response here, you can't let anxiety degrade your own self image!"
Anxiety,ew2epsj,t3_cmgrg3,1565044864.0,"It's incredibly difficult to share how you're feeling with people who can't necessarily understand the severity of poor mental health. Anxiety is rarely the sole problem from my own experience. It derives from issues that you may have never even considered in your life that are making you unhappy or altering your perception of events. Sadly anxiety tends to stick around even when you start to make steps towards working away from the worst mentalities.   


There are so many things you can do; from chatting to someone you trust, even if they don't completely understand how it feels; taking the step to accept how you're feeling as you have done so fantastically by reaching out today; therapy to help manage your anxiety day to day and work on continuing to improve your life; or helplines like the Samaritans, whom I personally called at 04:01AM yesterday morning after getting no sleep at all when a paricularly bad panic attack wouldn't go away!   


There's likely no one action that will overcome your anxiety for you but you can certainly take comfort in trying to overcome it, even if you fall at a few hurdles every so often. The important thing is to try because your mind and your happiness are the most important things and are certainly worth fighting for!"
Anxiety,ew2dh5t,t1_ew25522,1565044000.0,Same! I often let my fears become facts by failing to see them for what they are.
Anxiety,ew2dc4b,t3_cmgw4o,1565043903.0,"I certainly go through this, but not just with people I don't know. I panic about the repercussions of my normal conversations with almost everyone. Was I too boring, rude in any way, or holding the person back from some other interesting activity they'd prefer to be doing. I wish I had some advice for you but I'm not sure anxiety will necessarily ever go away. Focusing on understanding your mind and accepting your anxiety can help you to contextualise and manage the panic you're feeling, even if you can't prevent it from arising to begin with."
Anxiety,ew2cwpq,t3_cmh04b,1565043605.0,"I get frustrated with myself all the time for doing this! Through years of effort and support I've been able to sort out each step of my life to get out of the hole depression sucked me into. Yet every time I make progress the next big thing becomes the scariest thing in the world to me.   


Only this weekend I continued to try to reconnect with some of my friends from university having returned to caring for my body and caring about my job. It's been months of attempts, with successes and failures, but I've unfortuantely sabotaged the effort to reconnect with one of the most important people in my life before I closed off. By focusing entirely on how and when to try to reconnect, trying to be honest and trying to avoid defeatism at every turn I have spooked her away. There's no doubt that my anxiety over every message and action has caused me to appear weird and obsessive, thus sabotaging everything I was trying to accomplish.   


It's difficult to struggle with the doubt anxiety brings when your concerns begin to reduce in number, but it's equally as difficult to cope with the mistakes you make along the way. So you're certainly not the only one that goes through this, and I think we can both use some advice and importantly experience to try to understand and normalise dealing with this habit!"
Anxiety,ew2bmpy,t3_cmhais,1565042747.0,"Well done on reaching out! There's nothing wrong with what you did at all and to me it doesn't seem like anything warranting disciplinary action such as firing. Unfortunately I know that when anxiety washes over you and you're struggling for air even small things that everyone reassures you about can seem terrible.  


The only advice I'd give is to be open and honest about how you're feeling and the stress/panic/fear you feel about certain things. You don't necessarily have to talk to anyone but there are plenty of people who can listen (here, on helplines for anxiety, or your close friends or family). The most important person to be honest with is yourself. Don't blame yourself for how you feel. It's okay to be afraid and it's okay to find something that overcomes us in the moment but you're clearly striving to improve your situation otherwise you wouldn't have applied for an interesting new job!  


It's going to be tough for an indefinite period of time but every time you face a situation that challenges your anxiety, you're challenging the hold anxiety has on your life. Keep the progress coming and when this panic passes it could help to focus on where you've been succeeding in trying to get on with life despite the challenge!"
Anxiety,ew08w2v,t3_clxwr6,1564979507.0,"It's great to be able to take steps in the direction you want! I think it's wonderful to make progress, no matter the size or frequency. I hope you continue to feel able to put yourself into fresh situations, it took me a long time testing the limits of my anxiety to finally get through to not being afraid of challenging it regularly so keep it up!"
Anxiety,ew083cm,t3_clyl6i,1564978745.0,"One of the worst things about anxiety is that it almost forces you to doubt yourself completely, even in situations you'd have had no problem with before. It seems to me that you've lost the ability to trust yourself in how to perceive parts of your life, even though you've succeeded in seeking and sticking with therapy. I wish I could provide you with meaningful advice but I often face a similar situation to you."
Anxiety,ew07438,t3_cm2is4,1564977834.0,"I'm not sure what advice I can give because I don't really know how to deal with my own anxiety. I'm happy to share my experience and I hope at the very least you don't feel quite so alone in how you're feeling.  


Around 3 years ago I slipped into depression as I continued to ignore all the factors contributing to my anxiety and self-abandonment (I still struggle with valuing my feelings and concerns with any weight). This led to me completely shutting off from the world as I didn't even think that my friends would care about my absence. It took me over a year of pain, anger, and cognitive behavioural therapy in order to get back to a stage where I felt able to sort parts of my life out.   


The honest truth that I'm still ashamed of is that I still rely on weed to get me through many days. It's certainly not the answer though and I largely only feel that way because I still feel like I'm missing something in my life. This led me to reaching out to my old friends who I had abandoned. They all responded, met up and were sympathetic to what I went through but unfortunately have dropped off over the space of the last half year which has driven me to create an account here for support and calling help lines when I feel at my worst.  


In terms of advice, for me it was important to first come to terms with what I was feeling and accept it as being as valid as anyone else's problems. Secondly, and something I forgot when trying to reconnect, is that it's beneficial to try to manage your fears and doubts. Contextualise them so that they don't feel so overbearing and then try to find a solution either in actions or just your perspective on things. Lastly, it's important to understand your feelings. I know that I'll likely suffer from anxiety and periodic bouts of depression for a long time, thus my focus is on trying to learn to manage them and cope with the attacks and fear. I really haven't succeeded in managing things as well as I would have liked but I'm doing the best I can. If I'm not trying to live life then I've already given up hope! 

Giving advice on mental health is difficult, I've found it helpful to try to understand everyone else's stories and paths (easily done on here) and unabashedly sharing how I feel, even if I'm often embarrassed."
Anxiety,ew029cf,t1_evzsrzg,1564973690.0,"I completely agree, even when you may have overcome accepting your depression, anxiety, or whatever is holding you back there's no guarantee that'll prevent you returning to that state. It's a nice thought but personally I made a huge effort for around two years to sort my mind and life out after I had abruptly excluded myself off from the world. After cognitive behavioural therapy sessions I have successfully put most of my life back on track.  


However I've been trying to reconnect with my old friends who I abandoned in my worst moments. The results have been mixed but one friend has really made things bad for me again despite trying to do the opposite! Avoiding meeting up for months despite reassuring me not to panic and then turning around and acting spooked that I'm trying so persistently to reconnect. Even if you do get through the trouble you're going through there's no guarantee you'll be in the clear, and even small things can cause the great tormentor to reappear!"
Anxiety,ew0137m,t3_cm3j1c,1564972739.0,"The worst thing I've felt when suffering anxiety washing over me is that I don't have anywhere to turn. I personally just setup an account because the depression I thought I conquered has returned with a vengeance and even now at 03:38AM I'm struggling silently. I constantly turn to my friends for help and advice but I have only just reconnected with many of them after around two years of absence and so I feel the same as you, unable to turn to those in my life I'm meant to trust. 

The good thing is that the attacks will pass, but you will need to take steps to learn to deal with the cause of the attacks. I'm sorry if I can't give you specific advice on how to deal with what you're feeling but in truth I don't even know how to deal with my own anxiety and battle with depression. There's no easy way about it but you're not alone in how you're feeling, and it's great that you're able to reach out to talk about it!"
Anxiety,evzzyhk,t1_evyqjq6,1564971839.0,"That's exactly how I feel. I've always been able to connect with people but then I sunk into a depression that made me cut myself off from all but one friend, who I didn't see for months at a time. Two years down the line I've sorted many of my problems out with being open and honest about how I feel, with the help of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. However, now that I've started to reach out to people it's been a nightmare to actually meet with people face to face and it's really starting to cause my anxiety to return on a near constant basis.   


In particular one friend who I tried to reach out to has met up with me once and has constantly reassured me that they would like to meet up again, only to turn around and say they have felt too pressured to meet with me. I did everything I could to try to reach out in a non-intrusive way but I just can't text people like I used to without seizing up with anxiety and overthinking things into weirdness.   


Normally I'd try to reminding myself that I've come a long way and that I shouldn't be too focused on just one person but I didn't reach out to them after years for no reason. I just wish I could get passed the exterior that people have put up because my relationships with friends used to be so relaxed and easy before all this happened!"
