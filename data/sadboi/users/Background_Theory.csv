depression,fp7bgnt,t3_gbj4hr,1588367492.0,"Hey man. I recently began to pull myself back together after a nervous breakdown and subsequent depressive rut. The trick is to take baby steps and address one problem at a time. You are acknowledging you are depressed, sad, lonely and possibly suicidal. Recognizing there are issues is the first step in fixing them so you've already taken a first step in a way. If you haven't already look into getting a therapist and medications. Dont be discouraged if they don't even work the first time. I've struggled with depression since I was an adolescent and am in my mid-20s now. I'm that time I've started and stopped with several medications and therapists and just recently found a combination that seems to be working for me now. Until then, just take it one day at a time; clean your room, brush your teeth, get dressed, go to work/school and try your best. Celebrate these little victories until you can focus on larger goals. You got this. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk"

Glassdoor estimates the national salary is around 85K but obviously that I sure fluctuate with cities and location. I'd start with udemy, coursera and other online learning platforms to get your feet wet and learn about what it is. Some bootcamps and certificates and online nanodegrees can be completed in 3-6 months so if you got started early, would have plenty of time to pick a program and look for a job"

biostatistics,fjwthmb,t3_ff4nyu,1583645448.0,"Hi there,

I'm sort of in a similar spot to you I believe. I took a biochemistry and molecular biology undergrad degree and got lucky enough to get into a big biotech company in the bay area right after. I took some time off school to get work experience and really try and narrow down what it is that I wanted to go back to school for since I knew I'd most likely hit a wall at some point with just a bachelor's, but my company would give me tuition assistance if I wanted to pursue a masters. I took the time I wasn't working to really consider what was the best move not only career-wise and also get me the best bang for my buck with a graduate degree.

I realized with the big data revolution people with statistics backgrounds are in huge demand and I did well in my statistics classes in undergrad and high school and discovered biostatistics from there. There's an equally big demand for it in public health/biotech/pharmaceutical industries and the ability to combine science domain knowledge with practical math and programming skills makes for a marketable skillset. 

So I guess to answer your question I had to search for what is in-demand in the economy and also would make for meaningful work and used my previous knowledge and what I was good at. I was on the pre-med path until my junior year until I realized how long and expensive that road is, then hit a similar obstacle when considering a PhD and how it can be an equally long road with arguably less payoff. Wheras a masters in biostatistics is basically a statistics masters and is thus extremely flexible.

It took me awhile to come to this realization, I'm 25 now but just got the tuition assistance and am applying to a local state school biostatistics masters I can do while working and planning to take a community college course in linear algebra to prepare. This means I'll be in my late 20s when I'm actually working in the field if all goes well, but I believe the payoff will be worth it to have a free masters in a field in demand while advancing my skills in the biotech industry.

Hope that helps! Feel free to message me if you want to discuss :)"
biostatistics,fjdwih0,t1_fjdvmir,1583260618.0,Thank you for the insight! Why considering the PhD? Would you feel more limited with just a masters?
biostatistics,fjcgt0w,t1_fjcft60,1583219543.0,"Thank you! Yeah, I'm hoping that by the time I'm done the fact that I'll have worked through my masters and graduate with $0 in debt would make it worth waiting a little longer to get the ball rolling. My concern mostly will be trying to switch gears and change my career path after working in my current job for another 2 years while I finish up the degree. I work for a very large biotech company that does have a biometrics department so I've asked for some informational interviews to learn more about the day job to build some contacts. I'm a project coordinator right now so I'm sort of tied into the clinical side in a small way"

I was converted from a contractor to a full-time employee, and if I continue to stick with the job might end up as a PM one day. The company gives me tuition assistance so I'm considering getting my masters in biotech, PMP, and/or MBA one day.

The truth is you're gonna be working the rest of your life.

GradSchool,fehydij,t1_fehxus8,1579126351.0,"Thanks so much for your perspective. That's where I'm honestly a little torn. With my company's tuition assistance, I could do a masters degree in biotechnology at a school 10 minutes from my house and do it part-time and get some extra skills in lab work, coding and business and keep my job and salary at the same time. I really like science and research but I'm thinking it may be more practical to go into a managerial or other technical role in biotech without slowing down my momentum in the private sector"
GradSchool,fehtpqk,t1_fehr9g5,1579123676.0,Wow that's an interesting perspective and good to know. I know i dont want to stay in academia I'd want to find a way to reintegrate myself as an industry scientist but interesting that job options are fewer (I'm in San Francisco which is a huge biotech hub so perhaps I'm biased)
GradSchool,feh82az,t3_eoxh9h,1579111081.0,"Thanks for the insight. I don't think I'd want to do academia, but go into industry. That’s the one thing I feel like I certainly did gain from working in a biotech company for a few years now"
GradSchool,feh1xum,t1_feh0koh,1579107446.0,"I'd be going from 80k (with upward mobility, full benefits, tuition assistance, etc) to a 30k stipend lol. I'm not gonna lie it will certainly be hard to walk away from all that and the longer I wait the harder it'll be to leave it all behind, I'm 25 right now but it would be nice to meet someone else and settle down in my late 20s/early 30s and know that's gonna be difficult if I spend that time pursuing a PhD.

But on the other hand my job will always just be a job. It’ll be comfortable and safe but think I’ll always be wishing I just went the distance and pursued a real career in science. I certainly appreciate the honesty and insights!"
GradSchool,fegtr4q,t1_fegprqc,1579102339.0,"Thank you, did you mean that it limits your job opportunities without a Ph.D.? I  like the biotech industry and would like to be a scientist at a cool company big or small. My employer currently does support higher education up to 10K a year which is very generous, with that I'd be able to pursue a part-time master's or MBA but most likely not a Ph.D. since I'd need to go full-time for that. Not a bad option either, and I'd probably make more money going into the business or management side, but think some part of me would miss being a lab rat."
GradSchool,fefwom2,t1_fefuvi5,1579067662.0,"This is exactly the kind of pep talk I needed :) gonna bust my ass and make a killer application for next cycle and really narrow down what I want to do.

Best of luck in your journey!

Tom"
GradSchool,feftrd8,t1_feftlkd,1579064943.0,"Hearing this certainly made me smile :) granted since I missed this round of applications, I probably wouldn't even be able to start until I'm 26 or 27, but I guess we're all gonna be that age at some point. Better late than never I suppose"
biotech,febvq77,t1_febvgn5,1578963295.0,I'm in an analytical operations department right now and enjoy it! I'm a project coordinator and RA running a variety of different assays. I'm a bit of a cog in the machine with the assays at times but I enjoy being able to put in my headphones and get in the zone and go to work. What's a manufacturing or quality role like?
biotech,febs9rm,t1_febrwvs,1578962113.0,"Wow that sounds awesome! How is the salary for that kind of a role? Would having masters help? Is there any possibility for progression into a senior role or management position?

Thanks so much!"
findapath,fe4oadi,t3_elzwru,1578861307.0,"Hey man,

Honestly, you have probably had it worse than me, but I'm in a similar spot and can empathize. My parents and family are nice and supportive but my own insecurities and lack of direction or motivation led me to accept a position at a biotech company right out of college with my biochemistry degree. Sounds awesome right? Well, 2.5 years into working for this company I'm starting to get sick of it. I honestly picked this position because I was pre-med, dropped that before my senior year and then had no fucking clue what I was going to do. I felt like I had to do something, so I enrolled in an online master's degree. It's been ok but wishes I had just applied and hustled more and gone back to school at an actual grad school instead of trying to split a full-time job and grad coursework in an unrelated field. I'd literally just been taking jobs that came my way because I had no real clue what I actually wanted to do.

Truth is I'm exhausted and on the verge of dropping out and trying again with a different program. I've been so busy and stressed I've lost contact with a lot of my old friends. My girlfriend last year went back to her ex because I didn't have time for her. The only thing I look forward to now is the end of my workday when I can go home and lock myself in my room and not talk to anyone. None of this is healthy for me mentally but I'm recognizing this and seeing a therapist and re-taking the GRE to try to get into a different grad program and break out of this hole I've dug myself into.

As a fellow directionless 25-year old, I sincerely wish you the best. It's not gonna be easy to re-invent ourselves but it's possible. You got this."
depression,fdzsjxp,t1_fdzsb6f,1578794785.0,"I'm seeing a therapist who is wonderful and certainly helps for that given day, the inadequacy stems from more my career and life choices and second-guessing what I actually want to do with my life and where I actually want to be in it. I've just grown tired of my current job and lifestyle and want to go back in time or start over but feel locked in. I'm 25 and have no fucking clue what I'm doing and where I want to go in my life."
depression,fdzrysq,t3_eng9t4,1578794398.0,"I'm 25 going on 26. I' mm working while doing a part-time master's degree and fucking exhausted every day. I just want to stop and go back in time and start over. I'm in a similar position in that on-paper I have a good job, good education and a nice car as well but also feel like it's just all so fucking pointless sometimes since I still feel inadequate and always will"
gradadmissions,fdihzi9,t1_fdiheo5,1578443342.0,"Thank you for the encouragement.

At this point its not only a question though about what I ultimately want to be but the opportunity cost associated with it. Even if I were to drop everything to pursue a PhD at a later age id be taking a massive paycut and for the remainder of my 20s and possibly early thirties. 

But I'll keep hoping I hear back from something since I only applied to 4 schools this cycle. If I don't get something this or next though I might just call it"
GradSchool,fd3b2up,t1_fd3068x,1578156479.0,Nice! How large was your cohort and for what kind of program?
GradSchool,fczod58,t1_fczntnx,1578105635.0,"Thank you! What field if I may ask?

That's where I'm somewhat torn, I'm in the biotech world where you can certainly have a good, comfortable career with a bachelor's/masters degree (I'm a project coordinator/RA right now and could transition into project management or a data or coding job internally if I continue to work at my company) but I think a PhD would enable me to aim for higher-level positions and allow me to work on more kinds of projects and might have a stronger ROI, although I'm aware the road is long and difficult, hence why I'm cautious about starting so late."
MBA,fczmkmt,t1_fczmafw,1578104506.0,"I've noticed that does seem to be the case in the biotech world, even senior level positions do generally seem to have lots of PhDs in their upper ranks. I'd be on the older end but I am seriously considering going back to pursue the PhD regardless for my own ultimate career advancement. That being said I could also get a project management certificate and rise on my path to become a project or lab manager, although I still think an MBA could have serious benefits in the pharma world"
gradadmissions,fcvdysz,t1_fcvblhk,1578000100.0,"Yeah I figured. Guess in the meantime I'll just get more work experience, and finish my masters to boost my GPA and really look into the programs to make sure I know what I want to do. I'll be starting a phd in my late 20s at this point but guess it's what we gotta do :/"
cscareerquestions,fctb6qq,t1_fct86xm,1577937863.0,"I dont have admission statistics but a GRE could help if you don't feel confident about your grades. To be completely honest I didn't even submit GRE scores, both schools (and a lot of others) are altogether dropping the GRE for grad programs. For both schools its recommended but optional.

That being said I had a 3.3 GPA, 3 strong letters of recommendation, and lots of work experience and internships which I think secured my spot in lieu of GRE scores.

Everyone is different but put together a strong application and I think you'd have a shot :)"
cscareerquestions,fcstnpv,t1_fcs99m9,1577924816.0,"Thank you! Genentech is difficult to get into. I had to bounce around internally to go from intern to contractor to FTE.

I applied and got into the johns hopkins and northeastern bioinformatics masters degree because both of them have the online or on campus options so you can do it while working. I ultimately picked northeastern because it let's you declare a data analytics concentration where you take data science electives so that way I can apply to data jobs later if I want to. Feel free to message me for more info"
cscareerquestions,fcpiomh,t3_eidvov,1577865303.0,"Hearing this made me smile :)

I also went to uc davis as an undergrad, majored in biochemistry on a premed track then realized my junior year that I didn't want to do that either!

Thankfully I'm working at Genentech and using the tuition assistance to learn bioinformatics and cs on the side at 25.

Cheers to new beginnings!"
projectmanagement,fcjgo1r,t1_fcjgg1p,1577686913.0,"Thanks! Good to know I'm not the only one :)

depression,fbgubt6,t1_fbgbcl9,1576858767.0,"Glad I could provide some sympathy in some way I hope. What kind of grad school are you in? I was doing one of those online degrees so I could do it while working but now just feel like I'm missing out on the experience of networking and digging myself deeper into debt because of it :/

Thinking of starting over from scratch at a local school as painful as that might be"
depression,fbfldz8,t1_fbfk41w,1576813451.0,I feel that. I keep trying to keep up with the rat race of life but it's exhausting. I'm just trying to do the right thing but keep feeling like it always just blows up in my face when I try :(

SuicideWatch,fb1omkz,t1_fb1hp4g,1576439134.0,"I just spent my early career and life just rolling with the punches with no real direction. I enrolled in a masters degree program online so id be able to work but don't even think it's worth the time or money and isn't gonna be enough to make it in a new field that might not even pay well enough, I hate myself"
depression,fb0ikc6,t3_e9hksr,1576426316.0,Yup. I picked a major that by itself can lead to careers if I go to grad school (biochemistry) but spent too long hopping between jobs and fucking around I missed my chance to go back to school and better myself. Everyone else I know seemed to find something to move into and I'll just be working the same dead end job living paycheck to paycheck until I die. Hopefully I die soon.
depression,faov11m,t1_faoufym,1576273228.0,True. Im glad I'm realizing it but still feel behind the curve. Some kids at 23 are jumping straight into PhDs or med school and killing it cause they know what they wanna do meanwhile I'm over her with no idea what I wanna be when I grow up :(
