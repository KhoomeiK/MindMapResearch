bulimia,ffw1h96,t3_evhv3p,1580280353.0,"Same....I have friends and such but I get invited less and less and everything evolves events and parties and such, not eating and hating myself, do drugs and drink to avoid eating and numb myself and my self hatred.

I just wanna be skinny and fit but it’s so hard.
I can’t make myself commit to a relationship since im a train wreck and I don’t want to burden a guy with it and I keep telling myself “once I’m fit I’ll be enough and I can’t date etc etc” 

ED’s is horrible psychically and mentally...I really hope you find the light since I’ve kinda given up and I don’t have the energy to be positive anymore like I used to"
bulimia,ffw12x4,t3_et86se,1580279927.0,"I feel this, I tried to get help but couldn’t get any I feel comfortable with and just trying to figure it out on my own as I’ve always done.
It’s so hard to ask for help and I’m so stubborn and scared and tired.

Asking for help is not something I do and I express it all in poetry and art instead.
I’m happy for everyone who gets better"
SuicideWatch,fe81t0y,t3_eieayu,1578921469.0,"Yup.

AskMeAnythingIAnswer,fbf8x53,t1_fbf5l23,1576804641.0,"Ive experienced many strange things and deja vu and warning dreams just to get the deja vu and flashbacks and instinctively back off and often saved me from falling into places i would get up from and be hit by vehicles and even bad people trying to harm me. 
Deja vu is more than what everyone tries to make you belive is just fake.
I belive theres more than we can imagine going on

Society and the rich? That I already had a feeling of will happen since it already is happening and how ppl let it.

But how did you planet become like that?

And where did you try to go to?
Is there a specific you want to go and is t possible for you to find your way? Or are you stuck here for good? 

And whats the closest intelligent life/aliens from my earth? Present day 

And time travelling? How does it even work and made of?

And how the hell did dogs create the russia thing? Also what about snakes? (I really love snakes)"
AskMeAnythingIAnswer,fbf4534,t3_e9cbjy,1576801072.0,"I have a big fascination of how the brain works such as dopamine regulations and how psychopaths and sociopaths act, think and their nature.

Especially about stuff like lack of emotions since I pretend to have certain emotions but in reality i lack them and i dont let ppl get too close since they will see through me eventually.

I havnt really asked questions on reddit before so hope my questions arent too much.

Do you feel empathy? Hollow/something inside missing and trying to fill it up but its just running in circles.
Have you ever killed or harmed anyone/anything, animals people etc?

How do you view manipulation? and having people you have care/affection for and others merely just having a usefor and once they are no longer hseful to you they aren’t interesting anymore.

How was your childhood? Good or bad, happy or sad etc? 
Do you have any mental illnesses, depression etc?

Can you feel happiness normal or do you feel blank/numb most of the time?

How do you perceive other people and the human race/society and goverment?

Do you find amusement in things you shouldnt such as tormenting other people/sadistic behaviour?

Whats the worst things you’ve done? Said?"
AskMeAnythingIAnswer,fbf1ipk,t3_ecjipf,1576799158.0,"Uisng myself as an example here.

Is it true that experiencing deja vu’s and memories and intense emotions and feeling of something have happened but havnt happened to me is stuff happening in other parallel universes.

Such as predictive dreams and feeling energy and things you cant see but feel is presence is all, or is it something else?


And say if i did come to belive its true all of this, how does the society work there, how did you end up here, is it possible to travel to the past and back to present or future? Is it true that humans travels back to tourist the timelines of history and us current ppl.

How was your planet? What happens to Europe? Brexit and ireland? The fate of this planet/our universe? Do we inhabit other planets? Was Stephan Hawkings right all along about his prophies?  Does AI take a dark turn? A
Does drugs exist in your universe and if so what kinds and such?
What kind of animals/life is there?

I hope is not too many things to ask about, fist time and im intrigued."
