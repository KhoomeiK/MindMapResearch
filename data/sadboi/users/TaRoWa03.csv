And i'm not defensive of the government, I simpily am able to empathise with why Boris isn't on the front lines as such 24/7, and am able to recognise that he is a human and not just someone who helps make the system run. Do not mistake it for me making excuses for any actual shortcomings, and mistakes he has made prior or mistakes he may make in the future to come. I am simpily conscious of outside factors outside of his control. And whilst yes it would be better to have someone who is able to be on the scenes 24/7, replacing the front figure this far in will do no better in terms of the publics trust than having someone who is there to announce the important bits.

If you didn't make sure the kid had consequences then he would of definetely carried on doing it. If you feel bad about taking the money you could always give it back to the mother but tell her that her son isn't to know the money was sent back, so he still has punishment and guilt"
AmItheAsshole,fkbvgv5,t1_fkbuyx8,1584040655.0,"""Torture. Not talking about a slap here""
So very clearly the father didn't just lay a hand on his child but more. Sounds a little more than no if you ask me, a slap is one thing but more is already pretty fucking abusive. Disipline isnt battering a child"
AmItheAsshole,fkbuh29,t1_fkbtaw0,1584040109.0,"""What's abusive to you may not be abusive to him""
No.
That isn't how abuse works.
Just because somebody has grown up in abuse and is used to it and conditioned to think it's normal, doesn't mean its normal and not abuse."
BPD,fk8glp3,t1_fk8clip,1583955651.0,Refrain from trying to self-diagnose other people. If they have bpd they've already been to a professional and diagnosed- which you are not.
SuicideWatch,fk57l9q,t1_fk577m7,1583875020.0,Thank you. Its nice to hear it from someone else but also realisticly without sugar coating it.
SuicideWatch,fk53ibv,t1_fk45yiz,1583872762.0,"If you think its serious, please tell somebody who's there physically for him often, or can be. Or talk to him about getting him into psychiatric hold for a few days. There's only so much you can do apart from support him and let him know you're there. It's important for you to know that you are not his carer, you are his friend and there is only so much you can do"
BPD,fjyid5b,t3_ffh4l9,1583697388.0,"Hey dude, inbox me if you wanna rant about it or talk about any of it. I may not be the most useful but if you let me know what kind of support you want and how i'll try my hardest. If not doesn't matter, and i'm super sorry for what happened :("
BPD,fjy3n34,t1_fjy3av3,1583689169.0,Thank you so much! I have trouble thinking about other things though when i have the time to think these things. Do you recommend music and things like that to focus on external factors or is there a way to turn these thoughts into positive ones?
BPD,fjxscpu,t3_ffd320,1583682210.0,"Yup yup yup yup
If i'm angry or worried about something i create an entire scenario in my head where i get into this fake argument that never happens about something that someone has done to me and im too scared to confront or something i think might happen.

I don't think its very healthy, so if anyone has any tips on how to cease these daydreams or other healthier alternatives can you let me know?"
relationships,fjsl1a4,t1_fjseqz9,1583598097.0,The sub reddit is for anything related to it? So any thoughts or behaviours that could possibly be because because of BPD. And this obsessive behaviour is one of your symptoms then i see why not!
relationships,fjsdoey,t3_fewfej,1583596057.0,R/bpd might be the right subreddit for this! A lot of people experience all of these and some in the community comment on how they deal with it or their sympathies!
BPD,fjod5hf,t1_fjocq2n,1583525372.0,"I never said it wasnt. I said it was unhelpful. It offers nothing. People come here for some form of support that they arent alone. Everyone on a mental health sub knows they need therapy but some cannot afford it, or have access under parental care. Commenting you need therapy is blunt and to a sensitive person can make negative emotions worse when in that state"
BPD,fjo4g1f,t1_fjnpluq,1583520323.0,The least helpful of comments. Not everybody has access to one at this point in time dude.
abusiverelationships,fjo4col,t1_fjo47b6,1583520268.0,"Just realised you said he had the fetish not her. Retracting my statement, just whether she is consenting to that lifestyle or not"
abusiverelationships,fjo47b6,t3_fehl57,1583520181.0,"Here's the thing. If they're in a DDLG dynamic this entire controlling figure treating their 'little' as if they are just that, a child, is well common. You need to ask about their dynamic within a ddlg relationship, if he has set her rules to follow (which is why she constantly has to check in with him) and if she has punishments for breaking them. Normally i would say yeah i would be worried but in this relationship dynamic a lot of the time it is consensual and wanted. The not liking it if she texts when with him is a bit of a concern, but she might have a rule about that. You need to figure out about whether she likes having these rules, if she does have them, and if she agreed to punishments and the dynamic being 24/7.

Keep us updated, good luck"

relationships,fjgzl8l,t1_fjgy1ji,1583338576.0,She literally stated she had other hobbies. Considering she is attending two universities and all of that and i assume is working on top of doing art she isn't really gonna have time do all the hobbies she dreamed of especially ones that require payed lessons at certain times that are gonna have to fit around both her work and uni schedule
relationships,fj3i8zn,t3_fbcrob,1582984434.0,Honestly kids or no kids is a massive deal breaker. Its better for you to figure out whether wanting them or not is in your future and either carry on if you also don't want them or break up before it gets more serious and you break up because of this down the line
