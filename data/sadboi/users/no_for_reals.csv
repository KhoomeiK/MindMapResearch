>“These measures have not proven to improve public health outcomes, rather they tend to cause economic harm and to stoke racist and discriminatory responses to this epidemic.”

This isn't calling the ban or Trump racist. It's saying it's a bad decision because it will do more harm than good, *one reason of which* is that it can fan the flames of racism in the population.

>""This is a virus that happened to pop up in China. But the virus doesn’t discriminate between Asian versus non-Asian,” said Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), a former emergency room physician who will preside over Congress' first hearing on the outbreak on Wednesday. “In our response we can’t create prejudices and harbor anxieties toward one population.""

>Bera, who will chair a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing on the epidemic on Wednesday, said he’s concerned the Trump administration’s cautionary measures may be backfiring.

>“We shouldn’t have an antagonistic relationship with the Chinese. We should be working hand in hand,” he said. Besides the diplomatic blowback, he said, the travel ban “probably doesn’t make sense,” since the outbreak has already spread to several other countries.

>“At this juncture, it’s going to be very hard to contain the virus,” Bera told POLITICO, noting that his priority now is to get CDC’s epidemiologists into China to study the origin of the pandemic.

Again, his message isn't ""this is bad because it's racist"", it's ""this is bad because it will do more harm than good,"" and one potential harm is stoking racism.

For Bernie, again, he never said the ban was racist. For this one, I'll say that yes, he's implying Trump's xenophobia affected his decision, but the message of the speech is not that the ban was racist. It was that scientists should decide what the best scientific solutions are.

[Here's the context of the Biden quote.](https://youtu.be/QiOKZ8ARmqM?t=465) In this one he doesn't even mention the travel ban; he's making a broader point about how we need to feel we can trust our president and how Trump's track record doesn't inspire confidence. As part of his track record, he cites hysterical xenophobia.

Have you noticed that none of them called the ban racist? I'll agree with you that they're hinting at it, and mentioning the two ideas together has an effect on the listener, but again, that's very different from, say, the January 2017 travel ban. *That's* how Democrats respond when they think something's discriminatory.

If you want to say these articles lean left, then fine, I can see why someone would think that. But if you really think these articles rise to the level of ""the left heavily attacking Trump"", then you're just starting with a conclusion and working backwards.

By the way, here's my favorite part of the articles you posted, because it's the part everyone mysteriously forgets about: WHY people were criticizing it.

>Banning travel from China is unlikely to keep the new coronavirus out of the United States, especially as the geographic footprint of the epidemic continues to rapidly expand. This virus is simply moving too quickly and spreading too quietly for us to assume that we know where in the world all cases are. The current approach in most countries to finding cases is to screen travelers with connections to Wuhan or greater China. Though these efforts are helping to educate travelers and improve our surveillance for cases, they are by no means able to keep all cases of the virus out of a country because we will not find cases that originate elsewhere. It is increasingly likely that the virus will spread from other parts of the world, and there could already be additional unrecognized cases in the United States.

Let's say I recently met a girl, and I ask her out for coffee Saturday. She tells me she's busy that day and can't -- and let's assume she's telling the truth, in which case she's being quite direct.

However, ""that particular day at that particular time"" was never the point of this conversation. When I ask her out, she knows that I wouldn't do that unless I were interested in her, so she knows her response is going to signal her response to whether or not she's interested. So before she even thinks about whether she's available on Saturday, she's thinking about whether she wants to go out with me at all, and how her answer will be interpreted.

I know that if she then proposes another day, she's almost definitely willing to go out with me. If she *doesn't* propose another day, then she might not want to go out with me at all, but she also might have just had a brain fart, or wanted to see if I would pursue her. In a week, if I ask her again and get the same response that she's busy with no counteroffer, then I can reasonably assume that she most likely doesn't want to go out with me, because if she did then she would have tried to reschedule.

These are all reasonable possibilities that I would consider, even though *all she's said is that she's busy that day.*

I urge you to reconsider this stance.

We do this in mundane routine every day; when the train conductor comes to you and says ""Do you have a ticket?"" we don't need to be *told* that his intent is to make sure you've paid and not, say, to gather any stray tickets you might have found. When a flight attendant asks ""Do you have any trash?"" we know they're just collecting and aren't insinuating that we *should* have trash.

That's an incredibly broad claim. How did they define ""collectivism""? Was it done via survey or other measurements? How many ethnic and national groups were accounted for? Did they look at, say, jungle or desert tribes who wouldn't have any experience of what ""government intervention"" is? If so, how did they compare tribes to civilizations of the same ethnic group?

Why Somalia? Why not move to a safe, stable country where I can mind my own business without paying taxes?

>where we consented by being born here

I'm sorry, how much were you paying in taxes before you turned eighteen? Children are given the benefits of the social contract without the responsibilities, because it wouldn't be fair to ask them to consent before they're able. When they come of age, they can choose to 1) accept the responsibilities and continue to receive the benefits, or 2) decline and renounce citizenship.

If I didn't like the arrangement, I would do what any reasonable person would do and end the relationship instead of whining about it. It's not North Korea; I'm free to leave if I want to. The only coercive part about it is that you need to pay to formally renounce your citizenship, which is bullshit, but aside from that no one's forcing you to live here. This might surprise you, but some people realize that citizenship is an ongoing contract with benefits and detriments.
