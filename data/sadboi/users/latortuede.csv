BPD,fr228sv,t1_fr1lhz0,1589829907.0,"It's not an official aspect of bpd though. There are 9 official traits, and it's just one type of unstable relationship. I've personally only ever heard the term fp from this subreddit, never from a DBT therapist, and I really think having one is romanticized to a potentially dangerous degree here, when it should really just be a way to label one type of codependent relationship."
BPD,fr21dmy,t3_gm406r,1589829482.0,"Yeah, FPs aren't even one of the 9 official traits of bpd (they're just a type of unstable relationship) and FP isn't actually a term commonly used by DBT therapists (at least not in my experience). 

I think the term is used so much on this subreddit because for people who just got diagnosed, it's helpful to have a name for the unhealthy codependent relationships that they previously considered loving and benign. 

But having an FP is generally a problem behavior, not something to be accepted as normal. When I was first diagnosed, I found it more helpful to really think about the behaviors in my life that I personally wanted to change than about what the ""typical borderline"" experiences, though I know that's really hard. That's why trying to find a good DBT therapist is so important."

But at the same time, it's become most of what I think about when not dissociating. Like I can't just push it away for another day like I used to anymore, and it's coming out in all these minor situations. 

 It's super frustrating because I've been doing so well with using skills to manage my emotions and behavior, but I feel like all of the shit that happened to me is keeping me from being able to do more than just managing my emotions and urges.

You're literally gaslighting me, a complete stranger? There's no way you're not also doing this to your girlfriend.

But I'm not here to argue with you. The reason I commented was to remind anyone reading this with bpd that, whether you personally agree or not, your behavior is abusive and that this is not what a healthy relationship or healthy perspective of the disorder looks like. 

BPD often leads us to brush off red flags in relationships, so a post like this could potentially reinforce that type of denial, so I commented as a way to counteract that."
BPD,etmbhwa,t1_etm5aid,1562956235.0,"Ok, but what I'm telling you is that you *did* behave inappropriately. 

You might have taken her attempts to stand her ground as jokes (ex. saying she wanted to go home, not wanting to kiss you, explaining BPD to you on her terms, moving onto a new relationship), but based on her reactions, it sounds like she was actually trying to be taken seriously, and you couldn't respect that. In fact, you instead blamed her justified concerns on the disorder. 

This type of deflection of blame is emotional abuse, something people with BPD are especially vulnerable to. Also, just because someone has trouble regulating their emotions does not mean their concerns don't often make sense, and to assume that *is* degrading to people with mental illnesses. 

On that note, saying things like "" Dude, I didn't know if I was about to get stabbed, maced, or kissed,"" and ""Mmmm, girl, she's crazy and I like it,"" is really offensive and gross.

It's typically linked to unresolved childhood trauma which mainly causes difficulty with emotion regulation, maintaining strong relationships, and impulsive behavior.  

I have BPD, and a large part of what made me seek treatment was realizing that I had a pattern of rocky relationships and just generally felt like I was a shitty person even though I do genuinely want to connect with others and avoid drama. 

On the bright side, BPD is very responsive to dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), which was designed specifically for the disorder. Most people who go through treatment are able to overcome the challenges of the disorder within a couple of years and without medication.

Personally, I have BPD, so I'll often go from being overly optimistic and excited to help others one minute to feeling useless and like a waste of space the next.
