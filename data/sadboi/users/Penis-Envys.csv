Utility value would be things we use and need or things improve out life. Food, shelter, water and then smartphones, jewelry whatever. 

Here’s the thing we need money. Money is a universal medium of exchange. It represents an individual person labor or worth in measurable numbers. 

If we don’t have it we go back to bartering and that’s extremely inefficient. 

The difference between gold and currency is precisely that it can’t be printed and that’s it. It looks nice and you can make jewelry out of it, sure it doesn’t have much uses other than some electronics but gold has value as long as you’re in a society. 

But history has shown gold never fails and the fact that central banks are hoarding gold is something that I think is very important. 

Countries like Russia, India and China are also storing gold and all of them are starting to dumped US sovereign debt. 

The US dollar is still plenty strong but it’s becoming less and less reliable with the Fed propping up markets and straight up manipulation with printing. 

The economies fucked too, unemployment is record high and not everyone will get their jobs back for quite a while. Small businesses are failing and most will not reopen.

It can be a gold coin from the Roman Empire and it would still be worth something and plus the fact you can’t PRINT GOLD. You can find it but it’s rare and it has a limited supply.

wallstreetbets,fqu2ez6,t1_fqu0ymj,1589650711.0,"Last time I checked there’s more than just dopamine 

There has been studies where Vietnam veterans or drug addicts using heroin or other hardcore drugs have a very high chance of not being addicted to drugs when they have the support they need from families and friends, it was like 98% or something of not being addicted

You never mention how porn or fapping greatly impact our lives and mentioning just dopamine is vague as hell

Btw the video was ok, it wasn’t entirely on dopamine and it had some bits of info here and there but it was long asf

The main thing they said was your porn will become more and more extreme, sometimes it’s true sometimes not, it depends, generally it does go to more extreme or it was just a fetish you had but just discovered about yourself but it caps at some point for most people before it’s just disgusting. 

Dopamine does favor the “pave of least resistance” as I would say. Therefore if you wanna change something you need to make whatever you wanna do more appealing. If not rewards a punishment. 

But back to porn, it can be addictive but it still has roots. If you’re using it too much it’s because you have nothing to do or it’s a coping mechanism. To make up for what you don’t have. 

It can becomes a vicious cycle if you are actually severely addicted to it hours a day providing a positive feedback loop with negative results. But generally you can only fap so many times a day before you can’t do it anymore. 

But back to nofap. My main issue is it’s BS. There were many claims about major life changes and benefits that are just placebo. You can do nofap to get out of addiction but if you have other problems fix them first if you have em. 

Even drug addicts act normal as long as they keep on having it and in case of porn there’s an unlimited supply of it. 

Porn use is fine but if it negatively impacts your life or when you don’t want to use it anymore but can’t quit, then I would say start restricting yourself slowly.

Have a balance, key point. Shits not black and white. 

If you don’t fap you’re gonna be horny as fuck and that’s gonna mess with your quality of life as well when you’re controlled by emotions. 

Too much might cause ED by being too insensitive but can be a quick fix by stopping fapping and porn for a couple of days, weeks and months maximum. 

Porn might screw with your expectation NGL but generally they never include foreplay, after sex care and talking, cuddling and stuff that makes the experience more fulfilling or boring since it takes too long to get to the action. 

Some might just wanna get to the enjoyable part, some have fetishes they want fulfilled and real people aren’t providing it or unwilling."
