Before you learn how to code, *study and understand software creation*. Know who does it, what it encompasses, and the human beings who rely on it to help them. Know why and how it helps people solve specific problems. I suggest this because I see it as a course of exposure that would give you an advantage over others in the industry. 

Read [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) to discover wisdom about solving problems. Don't be romanced by fancy frameworks and technologies unless they offer answers to your problems. Build prototypes before going to code whenever possible. 

Finally, bring the same care to your coding that you took to learn about it. Software creation isn't simply the ability to code; it's the ability to solve problems and in so doing, create beautiful things that make the world better."
