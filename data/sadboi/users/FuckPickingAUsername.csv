BipolarReddit,fle02j1,t3_fo7jfd,1585075048.0,Interesting so many of you feel this way. What kind of meds are you on? On lithium I feel like I retained the good energetic crazy parts about myself while getting rid of most of the unwanted parts of being bipolar.

leaves,fkp8796,t1_fkp7g18,1584404004.0,Salute brother! I feel exactly how you feel. And it does bring me slight satisfaction knowing I’m trying and not okay with settling. But I feel like it’s taking too long and at a certain point I have to put up or shut up. I dragged myself to the gym to try to distract myself but man is it hard. I feel like total shit :/
bipolar2,fkp4rgg,t1_fkp3hpb,1584401772.0,Thank you for this! Giving yourself something to replace the smoking habit with is smart but tough to find. I started journaling again last night and I’ll see if that helps me like it helped you. Interesting that you didn’t go cold turkey. Idk if your way would be more helpful for me. As of right now I’m on day 2 and everything fucking sucks. I dragged myself to the gym rn by the grace of god. I want to smoke so bad but at the same time I don’t want to smoke so bad. I’m a walking contradiction I might be dying idk
bipolar2,fkp2vg6,t1_fkp25x4,1584400561.0,My psychiatrist is aware of my problem. He might not understand the severity but he is aware and knows that I’ve been trying to quit for some time. He doesn’t really give me anything concrete to do other than you gotta stop smoking :/
leaves,fkoupqf,t3_fjfxi3,1584395421.0,Man I think the T mixed with Marijuana makes it so much harder to quit then just one or the other. I’m on day two and I am dying. I have no real adult responsibilities today other than don’t smoke. And I’m barely surviving. Good luck bro.
leaves,fkotxed,t3_fjs07y,1584394942.0,"I had roommates who smoked heavy and I was in a frat that smoked 24/7. You gotta learn to be around it with out caving. Easier said then done as I never truly figured out how to do it myself. But one thing I learned is you can’t expect others to change just because you are. It’s kind of selfish. Best advice would be for you to really limit your time spent around your roommate for the first week of you quitting, after that it should be a lot more manageable to be around."

bipolar2,fehotlb,t3_ep2upd,1579120887.0,"I feel like what you’re saying is rubbing a lot of people the wrong way because it makes it seem like we haven’t tried to do this. I’m sure that’s not what you’re trying to do but that’s the way it comes off imo. If you’ve gone as far as being active on bipolar subreddits I believe you truly want to be better. To discredit others by saying all you really need is a healthy lifestyle can be seen as offensive. Bipolar 2 is legitimate disease and to say that you can just healthy lifestyle this away really makes me question whether you’ve ever had it. I worked so hard on building a healthy lifestyle. I used and still use apps to build healthy habits everyday, reminders, meditate, hit the gym, and cbt. But until I started lithium I was living in some nightmarish hell. No matter how hard I worked I couldn’t outwork this illness. Now that I’m on lithium it’s an absolute night and day difference and all those healthy lifestyle things I integrated into my life make me feel like I can really take on the world. When I spent the last 6 years trying to find the easiest way to take my life. Bipolar 2 is the absolute worst and requires medication."
bipolar2,fehbyiz,t1_fegxzgk,1579113415.0,Im feeling a lot like you are. I’ve been on meds since 5th grade and I’m 24 y/o now. Never have I felt so optimistic about a medication. It seems to good to be true. Just waiting for things to go bad like they always do.
bipolar,fefziqc,t1_fefvcgq,1579070622.0,Dude my experience is a lot like that. Haven’t really had any anxiety which is good. But boy am I energized. It almost feels fake but I feel good. I’m 6 days in. 7th day I double the dose. But for me I haven’t noticed any negative effects. Hopefully that doesn’t change.

bipolar,fec2gue,t1_febh9oh,1578965695.0,Hey that’s cool! I thought it was placebo that I’m feeling better this early (not great or anything but anything’s better then the depressive hole I was in for the last few months)
bipolar,fec25sz,t1_febe1dd,1578965553.0,That’s dope. I do feel different but I know it’s early so I figured it’s placebo. Glad you’re doing well!
bipolar,fec1vrn,t1_febc5ld,1578965423.0,THATS SO AWESOME TO HEAR!!! Thanks for the feedback. So two months and you’re starting to feel normal. I bet that’s a crazy feeling lol. Hoping to get there soon.
bipolar2,feb6qg9,t1_feaxyt8,1578955912.0,Thanks for the taking the time to respond! I was curious if it’s placebo that I’m already feeling better. Not necessarily feeling great or anything but definitely better than the depressive hole I was stuck in. But seeing you say you felt effects immediately helps. I’m slowly getting back in to the groove of things. Able to take care of myself eat shower clean my room etc. Hoping it continues to improve.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,f97gs09,t3_e3w26j,1575165382.0,The whole season sucks to me. I don’t think the story or concept is bad. But the pacing is slow as hell. No sense of urgency or high stakes. Never any threat of a major character death. Only reason I still watch is cuz invested too much time in the show to pull out now.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,f97fprb,t3_e3yglx,1575164977.0,I agree with you I’ve been so bored it’s ridiculous.. we’re 4 seasons in and I feel like there’s no sense of urgency in the show. Fan boys are getting upset but it doesn’t change the fact that this is how a lot of people feel about the season.
