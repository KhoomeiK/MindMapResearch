I have a suicide note on hand and loneliness is definitely a huge part of it. Watching others from the sidelines isn't a life worth living. I've been around people. I don't form connections. I get forgotten the moment I'm out of sight.

Anyways, I hope you're seeing a therapist. I am and although it hasn't been life changing yet we are going to see about trying a medication for ""social phobia"". I hope I'm a pill away from starting my life. If not, I'll see you on the other side. Good luck."

We could hear them go at it every day, several times and the whole house could hear it and sometimes even shake. My bro and I were kinda traumatized and sickened (I was maybe 15 and he was 11). 

It took a lot of courage to tell my dad calmly and he was hella awkward about it, but accepted what I told him.

Took maybe a day until we started hearing them again. My bro decided to work up the courage to tell my dad about it. This time, our Dad went ballistic and yelled and screamed at us telling us that he's an adult and asked us if we want him to be alone the rest of his life.

Needless to say we never brought it up again. Just listened in horror.

I was a loner no body my whole life and it seems to keep getting worse. Who knew I peaked in highschool when I actually had ""friends"" to talk to. Im 23 and am more than ready to die. 

I'll save you from my dark thoughts, but theres a couple things you got that I dont. You have a dream. You want to get into film or music? Go for it. Hell, Im pretty sure theres plenty of schools focused on that kind of stuff that dont really care about what grades you got. Another thing youve got is time. Im sorry school sucks. Its something we all gotta go through. I got through it by being excited to play video games when I got home, so school was kinda my break from video games. 

I know you probably dont like hearing that ""youre still young"" because I hate being told that at my age, but its true. You got time to plan for your dream. Yeah, youtube is a bit out of reach, but you know what pretty much all famous youtubers have in common? They had no clue their channels would grow and impact their lives so much. So its not a reason to not try, just dont do it expecting much. Have fun with it.

The truth turns people off for sure but at least you aren't lying. Maybe tell your mom the truth a little, break it to her slow and tell her that you're going through a rough time and your grades are suffering because of it. Of course idk what your relationship with her is like.
