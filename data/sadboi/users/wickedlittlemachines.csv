For me nothing can top The Cleansing from SS or Whitechapel's Somatic Defilement/This is Exile. I'd also add Die Without Hope/Slow Death from Carnifex or  Patient 0 from Enterprise Earth but that's just personal preference tbh"
lehighvalley,fos7duk,t3_g99hnd,1588025308.0,"I've gone to both of them, and I didn't really have a preference between them. Both restaurants had long waits, usually nothing over like 20-30 minutes. Bethlehem Twp one is slightly faster. I would say that the Fogelsville one was a bit unprofessional, though honestly my expectations weren't that high to begin with. More than once I'd gone to the drive through only for an employee to tell me they were closing due to nobody coming in.   


The food was/is pretty... alright. Considering the long wait, everything's usually fresh. I do enjoy how thin the fries are despite the fact that they're pretty bland. The milkshakes are okay as well, even though they'd make them so thick that I'd have to eat them like ice cream (not really a gripe, just an observation). I will say that I'd take their Wisconsin Buttery burger over any other cheap fast food burger. AFAIK, they took it off the menu :("
