I take trazodone for insomnia and started in December at 100mg. I didn’t notice anything the first few nights but it was really powerful once it built up in my system. 

Now I take 200mg every night and it knocks me out. It’s the first time I’ve slept regularly since I was a kid. It definitely has its drawbacks though. 

Not medical advice, just my story. I’m a bit complicated because I also have adhd and depression"
