ptsd,exzqld6,t3_cuvzw7,1566669641.0,"I know how you feel. I went through the same thing last year. I'm not sure if it is because I am in a different mindset or what, but I just stopped associating with the majority of my past friends. I felt like at first everything was fine when we would hang out, but later on it's like they triggered me. I automatically distanced myself from that. They would call and check on me and I just grew tired of it. I'm career focused and they wanted to go out and party. That was one thing. Also they constantly reminded me of all of my past traumas by making conversation about how I could of died. Then started making jokes pertaining to it. I one day woke up and decided I wasn't going to allow that in my life any more. While I don't have a lot of friends, I have quality ones so it makes up for the rest. Good luck!"
sex,exvdpic,t3_cug24d,1566597616.0,My ex never wanted affection. I went for 4 years thinking something was wrong with me for wanting to be loved on. Now I'm with someone loveable and caring and I feel like I am her. It is so weird. When my gf tries to be affectionate it makes me feel suffocated. Where I haven't had affection for so long. So we got a dog and all is good for now.

ExNoContact,ex05syb,t1_ewywo7g,1565905592.0,"I also blocked my ex on every level possible. I was confronted at my job about why I had blocked the person. I explained to them, that it was unhealthy for me to keep entertaining them and the thoughts, when it was all just pointless in the long run. Self care comes first. Good job!"

If you accept her behavior and try to get over it, it will just bother you and make her think it will be ok if it happens again. Don't sell yourself short buddy. Cut off contact and let yourself heal. She has already let you know she no longer needs you, except for a backup."

TrueOffMyChest,euyjkbw,t1_euyfr4w,1564103664.0,The point is you need to find your own happiness. Stop trying to please other people. Live for you. I know how it is to feel like your of no use to anyone. To feel so down that you don't want to be here. Stay strong and find that inner strength from within. You have made it this far. Rid yourself of negativity and only except respect towards you. Give and receive it. Be kind and it will come back to you. If you ever need anything let me know.
TrueOffMyChest,euyddaj,t3_chvmv8,1564100101.0,I'm not saying kill yourself. I'm saying open up your mind and stop being selfish. I was sexually abused from the time I was 6 till 12 and after that my mom manipulates me still to this day. My ex stabbed me in the chest after a big pill deal and spit In my face while she did it and said I hope you fucking die bitch. I spent a week in icu. If things can't get worse they will and the love of my life whom I still love till this day cheated on me and ultimately it ended. Stop being so hard on yourself and learn to live man. Things do get better

ExNoContact,eu1yu4q,t3_ced2ig,1563378578.0,I would let him know I was sorry and made a mistake and hope he would forgive you one day. I wouldn't push a relationship. Just let him know you were in a different place in your life at the time and have matured and come to an understanding of your actions. That you want to apologise. Idk. It would be nice to hear that from my ex.
ExNoContact,eu1vr7f,t3_ced2ig,1563376576.0,"My ex wouldn't stop contact with her ex and ultimately it destroyed any chance we had at a relationship. She ended up cheating on me mid relationship with this person and then wanted to try again after it didn't work. After we tried she resumed contact with the ex and told me if I wanted to control her friendships that we needed to break up. She made me feel like I was trying to control her, when ultimately she was being selfish and ignoring my feelings all together. I was made to feel crazy when I brought it up to talk about the situation. I was told to deal with it. I started seeing a therapist because I was in a emotional rollercoaster ride for years. It took being treated so poorly and moving out for me to realize everything. Especially after being told I will let you know when I need you. Still to this day I get upset at myself for allowing the treatment I received. Now seeing her and that dude being an on again off again couple makes me thankful I decided to gracefully bow out. I've prioritized myself as number one now. It is working well for me."
