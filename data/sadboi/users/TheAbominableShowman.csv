I started having delusions during the discard phase and they never went away. But I also have started trying to talk to the right type of girls and avoid anyone who shows toxic traits or doesnt treat me with respect so there’s hope there.

A while ago he just randomly told me that his dad used to tell him he (my dad) was gonna kill someone someday because of his anger. My dad said he always thought he was gonna kill someone someday because of that but I thought he said it in a way that it was like a thought that had been implanted in his head that he didn’t want. It still freaked me out at the time though snd after this latest blowup I’m reconsidering that context. I literally considered the possibility he was a serial killer after he said that. His snger is bad and it slways has been. He like shakes and loses control. He’s never hit anyone but he used to grab us and jerk us around during fits of rage and he’s grabbed my shirt and cocked his fist at me twice before.

My dad literally started sectioning me to psyche wards when I would rant about stuff he didn’t like (codependency, scapegoating, enabling, gaslighting etc). I have schizophrenia so it was pretty easy to get me sent away, until I learned how stay really calm and rational when the cops showed up that is. He even tried to get me sent to jail once and it came really close to working. When I brought up how crazy it was, he just kept saying different versions of “you almost got yourself sent to jail”. Another time he printed out an online article that literally had the title “jailing people with schizophrenia” and left it on the side downstairs for me to see when I went downstairs. I have a bunch of stories like this snd he refuses to admit that he was wrong in any of those situations. The only time he’ll apologize is when I’ve stopped talking to him and it always sounds so fake and he’ll only do it if the situation he’s apologizing for wasn’t that bad.

TrueOffMyChest,fldwybe,t3_fo0jvt,1585073335.0,"I really think people need to stop insulting them or they're never gonna admit they're wrong. It's a pride thing at this point.

Also, people support him because they feel lost and powerless, and trump empowers them and gives them a sense of identity. I think liberals need to be more accepting of outsiders that follow outside of the people in their ideology that they've been trained to defend (homosexuals, minorities, etc). If you look at the celebrities that endorse trump, it's almost always people who have been ostracized by society. People like Kanye and Dennis Rodman. People need to show empathy towards people like that and understand that everyone is largely a product of circumstance and environment.

I also think people support him because their sick of PC culture, and liberals really need to calm down with that. It's gotten out of hand to the point that it's become more a lifestyle than something that's actually about social change. Everyones so eager to humiliate some racist or bigot or sexist so that they can feel better about themselves and it's bullshit. It needs to be about changing people, not some social game, and changing people requires having empathy, even for the people it's really hard to empathize with.

I would also argue that the average liberal is very out of touch with what jung called the shadow and the average trump supporter can sense this. They can be incredibly self-righteous and truly believe their above others who act out or do bad things. completely oblivious to the fact that they themselves are capable of these bad things and that their life just hasn't gotten bad enough to bring that out of them. 

I have a lot more to say but it would take forever to type it all out but Trump support really does make logical sense to me and I think Liberals need to understand that they're fanning the flames with all this hate speech. And also that things like blaming trump for the economic collapse, when it was caused by the coronavirus, is similar to the misplaced blame tactics that trump and his supporters use. There's a million reasons to hate trump but people need to make sure they're staying logical and realistic with thier judgement. Otherwise it's just going to confirm conservative beliefs of liberal delusion and make the whole situation worse."
AskMen,fl99t7e,t3_fn2qau,1584946269.0,"I'm surprised no one mentioned the sexual pressure. And it's not just from society either, it's from our own brains too. When you're young, there can be this nagging feeling that you're not having enough sex and sometimes even this jealousy towards dudes you think are having lots of sex with a bunch of different girls. It can make it really hard to settle down into relationships too because a part of you wants to just try and hook up with girls. I think the hypersexualization of America make it a lot worse. Sex is just everywhere and even popular media can go into graphic descriptions about it (top 40 for example). That can be hard when you're trying to just be a decent dude and find a girl to settle down with.

Edit: Also male sexuality can be really confusing. The fact is there are a lot of really hot girls that just go for straight up assholes. And these girls are also into the dude being sexually aggressive to the point of being rapey. If you fall for a girl that is into those types of guys and into being submissive then it can really fuck with your head and cause you to question what you're supposed to be as a man."

He literally just howls “go away” on scentless apprentice and it couldn’t have sounded any more tortured. Almost every other song was either about how depressed he was or how bad his relationship with courtney was going. He had a photoshoot a few months before his death and refused to put down a prop gun he found and even put it in his mouth at one point. The dude never really processed his childhood or learned to love himself so he was sensitive and couldn’t handle all the stuff the press was saying about him. And then he picked up a vicious drug habit on top of it and had a baby and got married to a girl with probable untreated bpd. I’ve been with girls with untreated bpd and it can literally be a soul-crushing experience. she was definitely nit-picking him constantly which you can see in his lyrics and that wears away at you. Kurt also wouldn’t really let anyone in except for said toxic women (IMO tobi showed signs of npd), which he probably kept picking because of his unresolved mommy issues. Kurt really just needed a friend but he couldn’t handle the vulnerability, probably because his shit relationship with his father left him unable to bond with men as well. The ramblings in his journal are also quite tortured and insane sounding at times.

The reason people believe this stuff is because they don’t understand why Kurt killed himself. But I have a lot of the same issues he did and have come so close to killing myself too. In fact, if I had access to guns then I’m almost positive I would’ve impulsively blown my fucking head off by now."

I’m not an expert but I know quite a bit about psychology and people honestly show interest if you just talk like a fucking normal human or even find a kind of cool way to say it.

People laughed and I got sent out into the hallway. She came out and started yelling at me. I just stood there not reacting like I always did because I had no idea how to show emotion as a kid. Anyway, I dunno if this pissed her off more or what because she finished her rant with “you’re the type of kid who grows up to be a rapist because you don’t know when to stop.” I didn’t realize how fucked up saying that was until years later, especially since I was actually a very reserved and sort of shy person and had never even attempted to hit on any girls (I figured no one would ever love me or want to fuck me back then).

It’s not just narc traits that have been appropriated and romanticized. Things like codependence and arguing all the time are also glorified and treated like something they’re not. And yes it is abusive. Almost every celebrity over the past 100 years has been fucked up and humans are hardwired to adopt traits that are demonstrated to be evolutionarily beneficial (in this case guarantee money and fame which will benefit you and then your lineage for generations).

Struggle can actually give meaning to your life and it can seem like there’s no purpose without it. The problem is that we’re all trying to fill this existential void with transient pleasures instead of things that grant actual fulfillment. And we do this because the concept of god has died and without it people lost their faith in being good and turned to primal rationalism. They see people as an animal that’s sole purpose is to manipulate their environment to fulfill their own needs. I personally think someday there will be a scientific explanation for why humans adopted things like empathy and teamwork, and why it’s evolutionarily necessary. But until then we’re probably just going to be stuck in an endless loop of people becoming degenerates in response to their nihilism. Which sucks because a lot of people don’t want to be that way but it turns the whole culture into a hell hole that we all have to live with and creates things like cycles of trauma (some power obsessed guy wounds a girl, she turns shit and destroys a guy and so on and so on)

Sensitive people are usually sensitive to other peoples feelings as well (empathy basically), and they’re usually the ones truly listening to others and moderating arguments between different types and just generally bringing a lot of warmth to society. I think all types of people are useful but that a society can’t work without sensitive people."
PurplePillDebate,fal1hhd,t1_fakq0p3,1576176753.0,Yea I can’t argue with that. I’m British born living in America and I think the UK is the only country that’s really close. But the rest of the world is catching up IMO. Hopefully they don’t completely corrupt themselves by becoming star-obsessed like Americans though.
PurplePillDebate,fal19k7,t1_fakow0f,1576176639.0,"Yea but it’s like we operate on a sort of social capitalism as well. A lot of people are obsessed with dominance at the expense of any other personality traits. Which is sad because a lot of other traits are awesome. I’ll agree that every human does have a drive for power but Americans have taken it to the point that it creates mass insecurity, cognitive dissonance and sadness because no one can just enjoy what they have. We’re just always comparing because we’re obsessed with being number 1."
PurplePillDebate,fakkrt1,t1_fak5rx5,1576168780.0,"No it’s that we’re greedy, prideful, envious, wrathful, lazy, gluttonous and absurdly lustful. Americans have basically created hell on earth and they’ve done it using an ideology that justifies and romanticizes it. Meanwhile almost no one is happy."
queen,faiahrg,t1_faiabtn,1576103310.0,Yea it was good. I like it when they don’t glorify the subject of the doc.
queen,faia9cq,t1_fai7e2j,1576103163.0,Yea I did. It definitely helped.
todayilearned,fag7hs5,t1_fadiyaj,1576042650.0,I was one for a while so I know. It's horrible. I'm not gonna lecture you but there is another way.
todayilearned,fad0rej,t3_e8kme1,1575951914.0,"My personality has gotten so much better and I’ve gotten a lot tougher since going through a bunch of trauma. I also think this could’ve gone in a different direction and I could’ve ended up as a broken, bitter nihilist though."
schizophrenia,fabevxy,t3_e8e55b,1575922169.0,I like the background and the scribble style. It creates a cool feel.
schizophrenia,fab3xuy,t1_fab3ry6,1575917407.0,Yea it’s pretty sad that I’m hanging around with b listers like Ryan Gosling and Billie Eilish
queen,faav5dp,t1_faas65z,1575913958.0,Lol I was literally just watching that video. Pretty cool.
queen,faasljr,t1_faas65z,1575912997.0,"Wow that’s convenient. Ask him if there was conflict between him and his parents, particularly his mother. If they accepted his decision to be a musician or if they disagreed. What (zoroastrian) beliefs and morals his parents tried to enforce on him (how they felt about promiscuity or living a wild lifestyle). If his parents disagreed with homosexuality. I might have more but this is all I can think of for now. Thanks."
RoastMe,faai6ee,t1_fa9dt70,1575909134.0,No I'm ruthless. You have a very nice face and a great jawline as well. ROASTED.
RoastMe,fa9d7g8,t3_e82ajk,1575869410.0,I admire that you still have the courage to smile despite all the shit you’re dealing with. Burn.
amazon,fa5p5kd,t3_e4xlhy,1575817161.0,I purchased some lights recently and they lost the package. I filed for a refund and it said it would return it to the card or issue a gift card. I bought the lights using an amazon store card. Can I still get my money back or am I gonna get a gift card?
schizophrenia,fa5hi82,t1_fa2lno2,1575815160.0,Yes I’m very rich.
schizophrenia,fa1xrfc,t3_e7c10h,1575775527.0,Damn you beat me to the idea.
PurplePillDebate,fa1qwyb,t1_fa1hn75,1575773267.0,Yea or certain positions. Talking about sex publicly makes me uncomfortable So I’m not gonna elaborate. It’s a British thing I think.
