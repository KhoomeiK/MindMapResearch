nintendo,fo9njou,t3_g6aegh,1587624880.0,"The game I would love to experience for the first time again would be My first legend of Zelda game that I played as a kid which was twilight princess. It was the game that made me fall in love with the Zelda series so much that I own all but one of every Zelda game in the series. The game was crafted in such a way that it did feel like I was exploring an expansive and interesting world. I loved finding the races and how they lived in the world as well as the twili race from another world. I would spend time just running around castle town (which was my favourite place as it felt so populated and lively) thinking about what life would be like in the town. It also had the best companion in the whole series, midna, who had an actual character arc and I loved seeing her relationship with link develop. I would love to see this game again with fresh eyes so I could feel the wonder I felt all over again."

ThatEvilFarmingGame,fimfa7r,t3_f8ndo1,1582527952.0,I’ve played it and it has absolutely nothing to do with hiding dead bodies from the police and is just crazy and over the top in general with insanity. Sure it’s a gory obscure dos game but from the description of the game so far nothing about the plot or themes matches. So I feel like that wouldn’t be it personally. Plus you can easily search this game up and buy it on steam.
Anxiety,fhzvlv8,t1_fhz60ky,1582013765.0,Me too it’s bad on the weekends because sometimes I don’t have anything in particular to do. And then that just gives my brain more time to overthink.

AskReddit,eyvaoed,t3_cz013z,1567486351.0,"I worked in a clothing store where we pinned the sleeves behind the back of the shirt. A lot of the shirts were button up as well and people would leave piles I mean PILES of clothes in the change room. Every time someone tried something on we had to button all the buttons, straighten the collar, and then re pin it all over again. People would unpin stuff just to hold it up to those body to see if it may fit. Then we had to go repin those as well. It was an inevitable part of the job but also so tedious"

I just sat awkwardly playing solitaire and listened to the whole thing. The dude kept going on and on and the girl sounded like she was taking notes. They didn’t sound like they were dating either. Then a professor walked up and everyone casually switched to normal topics until he was gone and then they just continued their discussion about sucking dick. It was an experience to say the least.

AskReddit,evvt2k3,t3_cljt45,1564846640.0,My dad died when I was 3 so I’ve always given my grandpa gifts on Father’s Day. When everyone at school was told to make Father’s Day gifts I always made them for my grandpa and gave them to him. The amazing thing is that he kept every single one and put them around his basement with all his other favourite things. He died less than a year ago now so it’s a bit weird since I have no one to think about on Father’s Day anymore. It’s not exactly that sad though since I’ve been treating Father’s Day like a regular day for a long time. Just a time to tell my grandpa happy Father’s Day. Hope he’s resting well now.
AskReddit,evvsgwv,t3_cljtje,1564846195.0,"This time at brownie camp (it’s like a version of Girl Scouts but younger) I was tasked with doing the dishes after breakfast and had to go pee really really badly. I was terrified of asking the leader of the Girl Scouts to go to the bathroom because she was tyrannical. She once screamed full force at a scout for not having her sash that she couldn’t find until she was sobbing. She even put the leader of the brownies (her 18 year old daughter) in a time out for suggesting she might be wrong. But I digress, I was terrified so I made sure to splash a bunch of water on my pants before letting it flow and it felt awful and smelled awful. The kitchen lady looked at me with such a confused look but said nothing and for the rest of the whole day I was soaked from the waist down and smelled disgusting. Sadly we even stayed up late that night to watch the stars and I was begging for it to end so I could just change my pants. Thinking back I’m very surprised none of the adults there questioned this small child with wet smelly pants."
