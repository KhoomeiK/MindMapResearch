So it's important to be open and honest with them so they can be mindful and (hopefully) helpful. your child's thought process is not always as obvious as you might think.

You described him as your ""soulmate"". To me,  (married 7 years) that means someone you are completely honest with. Does he know about your history and struggles? If he doesn't,  I definitely recommend you bring it up to him. If he adjusts his behavior,  great, if he doesn't,  then he may not be as good a fit as you think."
EatingDisorders,fddm5h6,t3_eksea8,1578317455.0,"Hi there, I'm sorry your going through this, I'm sure it feels really shitty. But first of all, you should be very proud of yourself that you are accepting treatment. It isn't easy and it's a big accomplishment. I know it feels like your missing out, but you need to remember that this is about your health. If you had cancer you wouldnt be worrying about missing school, and this is no different. Right now thr best thing is to devote yourself to your treatment,  the more devoted you are the quicker you will get back to your life. Your college experience will be there when your ready, I know people who had to take off multiple semesters or over a year and things ended up just fine."
EatingDisorders,fddlt3u,t3_eksgr8,1578317121.0,"I'm so sorry that your going through all this. First of all, none of this is your fault and none if it is at all petty. You obviously don't want to go back to restrictive eating as you see that it doesnt work, you don't want to be in an endless cycle. I think before you worry so much about a sexual partner you need to learn to be more comfortable and confident with your body (which will ultimately help in that department btw) which is a hard thing to do especially on your own. Were you in therapy before? Is it something you would consider?"

fuckeatingdisorders,fdcgatc,t3_ekf9bg,1578274183.0,Right now you aren't thinking with your head. Trust your parents and eat. Everything will be okay.

As far as weight gain, don't think about it too much.  What you will think is rapid weight gain is mostly bloating. You will gain some weight but let your body do what it needs to."
