awfuleyebrows,fkg3cmj,t3_fi8edb,1584148935.0,I feel like this conversation should’ve gone “ways to find time to pack your kids lunch” or “quick lunches for your kids” or something instead of shaming other people for whatever reason they have to not have time to do so.

I’m a girl and I always wonder what it’s like to be a dude and I wish we could just be like some animals and just casually change gender. Idk maybe one day you feel like dressing manly or another girly (although you don’t have to be a man or woman to do those things anyway) I guess it’s just both curiosity and expressions.

thesims,fc6g30p,t1_fc62x9e,1577479742.0,I’m not too sure but it seems to me that it adds some kind of layer over the top of your gameplay that you can tweak to whatever you like. It’s pretty confusing at first but it’s really nice!

TooAfraidToAsk,fb9utoj,t3_ec08w8,1576650731.0,"I think that’s completely normal. Honestly you come to find you have lots of different groups of friends, those that you spend no time with and connect with deeply/talk about personal things, and those where you just make memories with and just enjoy each other’s company. My closest friend I hardly see and spend time with in person but we always have the greatest chats. I don’t think that’s fake at all, some friendships don’t have to be that whole super meaningful thing people always make it out to be. Sometimes it’s just enjoying their company and them enjoying yours"

Wellthatsucks,fb7bo5x,t1_fb6l8td,1576584198.0,This!!!! I always think about this when people discuss proposals being rejected or something. every partner I’ve had serious or not marriage/future or whatever always casually came up in the conversation . I’m just surprised because you’d think that if you were that far in a relationship for marriage to be the next step you at least would’ve talked to your partner about it to make sure you’re on the same page?? That way proposal rejections wouldn’t even be a thing

I can understand how kids noticing disappointment can be damaging but as I got older like 10+ it also just helped me understand that my dad was still a human, could get upset, but also chose to be patient instead."
