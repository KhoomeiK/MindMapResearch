He's already helped me reach some realisations in my life, one important one being that the purpose of my gaming addiction, agoraphobia and isolation throughout my twenties was to bring me comfort after an unstable upbringing. I thought I was messed up and destructing. Instead I was trying to keep things stable and predictable... and was building. Building a foundation to grow from so that I could take risks from a place where I felt safe. All of this I was doing unconsciously.

Made a den in the under-stairs cupboard. Read books. Played with the neighbours' kids and talked to them over the fence. Marvelled at the fact that they had a telly in the kitchen.

The thing that helped me singlehandedly more than anything was lowering screen use in the evening (around 5pm onwards) and turning orange screen filters on at 5pm, and opening the curtains as soon as I got up I the morning and leaving them open all day. Sitting in the garden in the sun was also helpful.

I spent hundreds on expensive daylight lamps and glasses. They did help, but I found I didn't even need them if I just did this. Now whenever my sleep goes awry it's due to lack of discipline in these areas, and to get my sleep back in order I just make sure I'm doing the above. Hope this helps."

I have one big regret of spending all of the thousands of inheritance money left to me that I acquired at a young age. It was enough to cover a deposit and more for my first house. But I think the issue is in the act of dwelling. This life is an imperfect tapestry and we are the imperfect threads. Everyone makes mistakes - big and small. If we can accept that we fucked up and it's completely shit but all we have is what we are working with now, then maybe we can try to bring ourselves around to feeling like no, it's not what it was, not what it could have been, and it may never be that way again... but it's something, and it still has a lot of potential.

I had to learn that people make fucking stupid mistakes and I was one of them, and the illusion of being perfect and doing everything the right way all the time had been broken. And I think that's what hurt the most - the realisation that I could monumentally fuck up. The next part of the lesson was learning how to live with this new, more realistic view of who I was and my capability of making big mistakes, and how to eventually forget about and accept myself as it, and move on from it.

Right now it's raw for you and I don't think it would be easy for yourself to feel about all this in a positive way right now. I think it would be unrealistic, actually. So maybe all you have to do is feel the entirety of how awful you feel. You did something possibly irreversible. You feel terrible.

I just want to let you know though, that it does get better with time, and that act does not define who you are as a person, who you will ever be, or how your life will always be."

I used to be a social butterfly and have all these plans as a teenager, but my life didn't go that way.
I've given my not doing those things I wanted to a lot of thought, and I've come to a point where I'm  completely at peace with it. I'm at peace because I realised that sometimes life happens and we don't get the picture perfect life when we want, but what we can always do is do it at a later date.

I will always be inspired by this article I once saw of a man in his 90s, just graduating.
Your life is not over until it is over, and you can use it however you want at any time.
My twenties can be in my forties. My twenties can be any time. I think, to be honest they will be in my thirties, as I am now not agoraphobic anymore through two years of self led exposure therapy! :) so I'll be able to do all those things that I wanted to do.

At a time around 4-7pm, put an orange filter on all of your screens and turn brightness to low. Or, don't even use them.

You don't have to set your alarm to fix your sleep this way, just start with that daily sunlight, and slowly move the exposure to it back and back as you wake up earlier, eventually until you are waking at 7am and opening your curtains around this time, too, and getting some daily sun. You don't even have to go on a walk during the day, just sitting in the garden sometimes and daily open curtains is enough to change things.

My sleep was fucked and cycling around the clock, over and over, for years, and I spent many fornights at a time for years completely nocturnal (was unemployed). What fixed it more than anything was opening the curtains and banning that blue light after 5pm. It began to slide back naturally. Now I naturally wake with no alarm, even after a bad night's sleep, at 8am. My body loves 8am because of the sunlight that I've been getting (and the evening screen filters).

I was a gifted child, but I began having panic attacks in school and left without any qualifications. I had no guidance or direction from my parents, but my grandmother would tell me that I've ""got a good brain"" and could go far. I didn't, but I've come to terms with where I'm at, and I'm happy.

In education or not, your happiness is of #1 importance. You really need to do all of this for you. This is YOUR journey and yours only. Who cares if you ever dare be imperfect? Who cares about the people who care about that, if they do? Remember, imperfect people still pass things. I used to be so afraid of being mediocre. The ""be the best"" mentality is never a healthy one and that was where I was at. But because I was so afraid, I just didn't try. The best that can happen is you try and pass with flying colours. The worst that can happen is you don't try. And I didn't. But I'm not mad about it! Life goes on :) There is life after even that.

I think people with anxiety need more targeted explanations and more scientific reasons for why those things work.

E.g. (what I've learned from my experience)

Having a cup of tea or a bath, or other self care things will make you feel cared for and better if It feels like there is a nervous inner child energy when you have anxiety that needs soothing and reminding of its routine. It WILL soothe this energy if you do self care at this time.

Having water and sitting down will make you feel better if your anxiety is around feeling faint or dehydrated. It WILL ease your symptoms if you are feeling faint.

Mindfulness and object describing, as well as guided visualisation meditations will make you feel better if you have racing thoughts, because you can only think of one thing at once. It WILL slow them down and get them onto one topic.

Breathing techniques will make you feel better if you are hyperventilating because you can't breathe two ways at once. It WILL slow your breathing down.

Muscle relaxation exercises (tensing and releasing) will make you feel better if you are holding tension in your body because after tensing purposely, we then want to relax the muscles straight after. And your muscles can't be tense and relaxed at the same time. It WILL help your tension.

But often, not even health professionals get this specific. I feel only a targeted answer for a targeted need helps me. 

Sometimes you feel generally ""anxious"" but what you  need is only one of these things, because your anxiety is THAT kind of anxiety on that day. I'm sure there are many other examples, too."
Anxiety,fnyt95x,t1_fnwkxwz,1587374803.0,"Thanks, that's really nice and considerate of you! :)

There are three states the nervous system can be in - rest digest, fight flight, and freeze, and people with anxiety seem to mostly hang around the latter two. There's also this thing called a window of tolerance, and that's like the window in which you are in rest digest. This is smaller for people with anxiety and people who have been through a lot of trauma. It means they slip way easier into those other two modes, can experience them for longer and are likely to hit a more extreme level at smaller triggers.

I hope this helps. It's hard for us because what we do is so biologically ingrained and learned. But there are ways out, slowly, however, quick fix suggestions never help us. We have real illnesses/predispositions that need real treatment to help us not function primarily in those modes, and feel safe enough to leave them and live in a state of mostly relaxation (like the average person)."
OCD,fnys4o0,t1_fnyfzg7,1587373599.0,"Wow, that's a great point. I started getting OCD in my early 20s, and before that I didn't do any compulsions. I still had just as much anxiety before that. But it's like a learned response, now. I've found all these different ways to calm my nerves (compulsions). But like drugs, you need more and more to get the same effect over time. Interesting. Thank you!"
OCD,fnxs418,t3_g4ajni,1587345195.0,Could you elaborate? I'm interested to know your experiences
OCD,fnxqoi0,t1_fnwhkzk,1587344322.0,"I really get you, and I also feel like sometimes this obsession comes up as a murky feeling, and that makes it even harder to treat! I've just been trying to ride it out, but it's very uncomfortable. My fears are health related, having two relatives with dementia, so I worry about making sure I am healthy there and thinking lots too. I also have sensorimotor OCD.

It's so hard to put these abstract thought obsessions into words, but I do think I understand and can relate to a fair bit of what you've mentioned. You're not alone, at least :)"
OCD,fnxi9mi,t1_fnx5bdj,1587339192.0,"Yes! This is so so it. I've been doing my compulsions a lot because my mind has been racing and I'm not sure if there are new themes here, or if I'm just anxious and this is a phase and I'll stop worrying about these particular things soon. I want to relax, I want to know what to do with myself but this low level anxiety is there almost all the time. I guess we can just hope it eases up for us both soon."

nosurf,fnvkvab,t3_g45cj0,1587297014.0,"Not really. I missed the kind people on there who became sort of friends but mostly acquaintances. I had to move on from IG even if it meant walking away from good people across the world. I focus on local connections these days, it meets my needs far more. There's no way I or anyone else would have had the emotional bandwidth to care about the 150 people I followed on a friendship level, so I felt I was just wasting my time. I'm a ""put it all into a couple of people"" person. It was tiring and presented no benefit to me once I really thought about it.

It's nice to think ""Ooh lots of people, lots of commenting, lots of socialising"" but it doesn't really go anywhere. You put your all in and then realise that these distant friendships would be a struggle to maintain if only maintaining one, let alone all of them. It made me realise that following people who a good connection will not happen with is pointless, and vice versa. I don't do the whole numbers follower collecting thing. It has to mean something to me. And it didn't. I tried to make it so, but it didn't."

Anxiety,fnvatm0,t3_g42zra,1587286345.0,"This is how my anxiety manifests primarily. I gotta run. And run. And run. If I'm getting it in bed I will make running motions with my legs, all night. It's  extremely tiring and I can hardly walk the next day, but how else can you deal with your body wanting to move constantly while this feeling is there."
Anxiety,fnuint3,t1_fns86fg,1587263000.0,"Not Reddit related, but I heard from my mother recently that my estranged sister is suffering from extreme low confidence. Guess who was the one always leaving snide comments. I always thought this may have been a motivator for her but now I know now she feels deep down. I think this is a common issue."
