AskReddit,erdgumi,t3_c1bhpc,1560741579.0,When I was a child we had woods back behind our house. I awoke earlier than everyone else one morning around 6 am and as I looked out our sliding glass doors at the back of the house I saw a  huge 7-8 foot tall black and hairy creature that stood upright and walked just like a human go into the woods... freaked me out. I think I was around 6 or 7... I’m 46 now and I remember it like it was yesterday
