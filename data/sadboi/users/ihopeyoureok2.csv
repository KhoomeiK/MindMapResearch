NPD,fkkml8y,t1_fkkj799,1584287412.0,"makes sense, i got vibes of him being rejected for how he looked based off some stuff he let slip out. he'd talk like a kid who has the dream of being a rockstar (grandiose fantasy?\~)

i thought bpd because occasionally he seems empathetic. i tried leaving him before and he cried and hes cried a few more times including when we finally broke up but i guess alligator tears r possible. he would often misinterpret a neutral statement as me attacking him

pretty sure i got devalued the second i mentioned something about how negative he is all the time"
