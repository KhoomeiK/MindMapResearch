So I went to McDonalds and ate a big ass burger and McFlurry for dinner instead and drove right past the two bottle shops on the way.

When they say ‚Äújust for today‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt always apply to early sobriety. I‚Äôm 9+ months in and some days it‚Äôs still a ‚Äújust for today‚Äù day.

BipolarReddit,fom1f91,t1_fom0zdj,1587875705.0,"If you‚Äôre suicidal then I suggest you contact your mental health team, and if you have an active plan contact emergency services. Also have a safe adult care for your child if you live alone with them.

I suggested you link in with a social worker and mental health support services and you say it‚Äôs ‚Äúpreaching to you about my bullshit‚Äù. And I‚Äôm also ‚Äúa piece of garbage.‚Äù I gave you clear and simple guidance about people who can support you in your application. 

I can see you aren‚Äôt open to help or supports, therefore I cannot help you. 

Food banks and charity will help with food and some basic necessities. Social services may also be able to assist but I doubt you‚Äôd be open to it.

I suggest you get in touch with some mental health organisations and maybe a social worker for some support. It sounds like working to help you maintain employment would be beneficial. 

Can any medical professional write a report to support your application? A psychiatrist or other specialist perhaps?"

He lost his erection. 

I tried sucking him off again (side note: sucking a completely placid penis is gross af) and...nothing. I offer to postpone and he agrees. 

Turns out he‚Äôd just got out of a relationship and I was his first post-break up. Felt really bad for the dude.
