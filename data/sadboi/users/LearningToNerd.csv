depressionregimens,fr34j8m,t3_gm26mo,1589849794.0,"Doctors always try to up dosages, but sometimes down is the right answer. Also, if you haven't had one, look into getting a Gene Sight test. In the short term it can be expensive. In the long term you could save a lot of money on drugs that are shit for you. It was super informative for me. It sorts out an absurd number of drugs, based on a gene test, telling you which drugs you will react badly to and which one could be better options. This is not 100% accurate, and is still a developing system. But in the passed few years they've made a lot of headway. When I did it, I was kind of at the point of having nothing to lose. The first thing I found was that when my doctor was upping my dosage of the anti depressant I was on, they recommended lower doses for me, because the reaction to Higher doses could be the opposite of what I wanted. It also recommended 7 drugs I had never even heard of as probable best options for me. We immediately cut my dosage to start weaning me off and change drugs. It was instantly better. In a week, besides some physical withdrawals, I felt so much better. I was finally able to leave my apartment again. Its only progressed from there. I finally have a life again. Its just a cheek swab in your doctors office. Definitely worth asking about at the very least."

I'm a kind of crappy person sometimes. I'd want to play this game for a bit. Born again Christian? Excellent. Allow me to support your faith. Church every week. Let's watch this ten part Bible series on the history Channel. I rented the I can Only Imagine movie, let's watch, while sitting on the couch at a non provocative distance. Pray before we eat. Your wardrobe should be more conservative. And let's start attending this couples Bible study i found. 100% cotton only, we can't mix our fabrics. No swearing. And we each need to tithe 10% of our income, so that'll slow down my ability to afford a ring for you. Sorry. But worth it, because Jesus right? 

Now on to real answers. 

At face value this sounds super manipulative. But I don't know her, so I can't say she isn't having some wild spiritual moment. But if it is manipulation, that's not a good start to a relationship. 

First off, would a proposal actually be satisfying to her? Now if you propose immediately its going to seem like you did it for sex. You can't win there. Also, does she want to turn around and have kids? That's all expensive, and if you are going to law school, way too much stress for a new family. Ideally you wouldn't have kids till you are wrapping up law school, so maybe you just shouldn't have sex until then. Obviously kidding. But imagining the look on her face if you told her that. 

do you actually love her? Or have you just been with her for so long, she was your first love, it all sounds right? I absolutely get wanting to wait. But you guys aren't even close to being on the same page. Sometimes you can have love for someone without really being in love with them. I was engaged once, and we broke it off. I loved him. But we realized we made great friends and a terrible couple. It sucked, it still hurts, but its okay. Its okay to decide that something isn't the best choice for you. If you want to wait until after lawschool to get married, then you should absolutely do that. Its a fair choice, and your life. And if she isn't willing to wait for that, them maybe she's the wrong person. 

Tell her what your long term plan is, leave sex out of the conversation, and ask if she's willing to wait for you, and see what she says. If she protests and argues, then it might be best to let her go. If she says yes, well then maybe she isn't bluffing here. Which also doesn't mean you have to stay with her. Sex is a healthy part of a relationship. If the sex is awful or just not happening, you are allowed to move on. 

Do you trust her? Do you want to be with her forever? When she walks in a room do you smile? When she holds your hand, does your heart feel happy? Do you take interest in each others interests? Can you sit in a room and do nothing together? Do you speak the same love language?"

firefly,fq2kpsv,t1_fpxh0zy,1589057079.0,"I mean, I disagree. I don't understand the comment if it came under whedon. Literally no one else could do it. He was the writer and director. 

I think the concern becomes, shows that run too long have the risk of getting ruined. But thats not a reason to not do something. Even if it is just a mini series. Like its 15 years later, are they still running from the law after exposing the Alliance, and here is Zoeys rebellious child because she was actually pregnant when Wash died, did Simon and Kaylee get together, blah blah, random adventure, Mal finds love again, end with some big grand happy moment, literally just to give the fan base satisfaction because there is nothing wrong with that. Its become a large enough fan base in recent years that it would be worth it for them.

I think we have to keep in mind who whedon is. He has zero problem killing off main characters. He even made a point of it, and once said, just because you like them, doesn't mean they are safe. Like if you think of Buffy or Angel, both series killed off some lead characters. And they didn't kill off the title character permanently, but did manage to kill and revive them a few times. His series Dollhouse made a point of stories can continue without the characters. There were 2 seasons. And each season ended with half of an epilogue. In those, the main character was no longer the main point. They did bring back the other characters in ep2, but after years had passed, and still killed a bunch of them off. But it was wildly important to the story, even though it was outside of the dollhouse. 

Lots of shows have done reboots or come back seasons years later that were wildly successful. Twin peaks, Battlestar Galactica, better call Saul, 24, walking dead.... they've redone Spiderman twice and everyone still loves it. Doctor Who is a constantly rotating cast/characters list and a massive fan base. 

And even if each season did contain a new cast, the aesthetic of a space western is so rare and unique to firefly, that I would love to see it, as long as Whedon was running it. And the comics continued far enough into the story line, I doubt they'd continue without at least addressing it."

""Some blue collar job...process engineer whatever that is"". You are acting like that is all beneath you. And you told him not to marry a waitress, which is beyond shitty  on many levels. He is your son. If he wants to do blue collar work, then that is perfectly admirable.  Someone has to. Lots of people live contently with those jobs. And who cares that she is a waitress? If that is what she likes. Have you even taken the time to get to know her? Or do you just insult her? 

It sounds to me like the real problem is your love for your own kid is based of your definition of his success, and not the fact that he is your son and happy. 

A college fund is to start someone off in life. If his start to life was different than your initial plan, oh well. There is no reason that money still can't help him start his life in different ways. If you don't think he can be responsible with the money at this time, directly pay the repairman, or for the car, instead of handing it to him. 

Instead of insulting your sons life choices, how about doing something productive or useful? Help them make a budget? Help them rewrite resumes? Suggest trade school. Suggest cheaper social activities. Try accepting and loving your child instead of forcing your ideal living on them."
firefly,fpw4y1g,t3_gfnafq,1588957328.0,"People keep saying it can't come back because reasons. But I haven't heard a reason I agree with yet. 

Wash and book were killed off for the event the show was revived. Whedon asked who would ever consider coming back. Those 2 actors said they wanted to go ahead and move on. Everyone else committed to coming back in one form or another. So he killed off those two to give them heroic exits. 

The idea that it has been too long is not true. The story continued. There is a whole series of comic books following the story. Whedon did this with a lot of his shows as they ended. So there is a continuing story, they can just pick up later down the line, leaving the comics to bridge the story gaps. 

The only mildly convincing argument is, which production company would actually take it on, yet leave it alone to Whedon to do his job, instead of fucking it up like Fox."

You can like and praise any actor you want. For him to get upset about that is absurd. He can disagree. He can not deny you your right to an opinion. 

No one should ever wish rape upon someone. That's one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard. You should never so easily throw it out as a threat. And you should never use it to win an argument. While it is true that some countries and cultures have higher statistics or reports of rape than others, that isn't a point of argument, and should never be used against someone. You can't attribute that to an entire race of people. 

This is a behavior and mindset you can't fix. This behavior doesn't get better. When people say you can work through a fight, they don't mean this. 

This idea that just because he hasn't raped you he is a good man is a really gross mindset that he has. And you can't change that. It'll only get worse as he gets more comfortable showing his true colors. 

 You should get out now. And he will try to manipulate you into staying, call you names, say you are over reacting, say you can't do better than him, but recognize it as manipulation, and that none of it is true. You absolutely can do better and deserve better. Don't let him get in your head."

AmItheAsshole,fpkomzr,t3_gd97bm,1588698357.0,YTA. You what? Dude. It's not about the money. You could have bought a replica of the ring. As long as it wasn't meant for another girl! You put no thought into her. And she's probably unsettled by the fact you saved a ring from your previous relationship. Now she's going to be comparing herself to that girl. This is just painful.

AmItheAsshole,fpiew52,t3_gdhfdi,1588639489.0,Honestly you were nicer than I would have been. You did something proactive to skip a fight. I would have lost it. He moved into your space.

AmItheAsshole,fp89mfw,t3_gbl3wk,1588386943.0,"NTA. So I have worked with a few autistic people, and studied special education in college. And most of those I worked with just want to fit in and have as normal of a life as possible. A part of a normal life is constructive criticism and hearing things you don't want to. In my experience, those that dealt with those realities had the most success. Those that used their autism as, I hate to say this, but an excuse or a crutch, struggled more. I hate to say it, because there is no average autism. It is a spectrum. Everyone is different, everyone has different experiences with it, some people struggle more than others. So we obviously can't say, just get over it, come on, conform. But this is years of tension building, you've expressed that the way he talks to you is frustrating. And he asked you for an honest answer and you gave it. Yeah, it sucks his confidence is a bit shattered. But maybe the reality is he needed to be knocked down a peg. Having autism doesn't mean he hasn't also built a sense of entitlement, that sounds like it was spurred by your mom spending his whole life babying him. You are his sister. He should be able to count on you for blunt honest when he wants it, and love when he needs it. It sounds like you are doing the right thing. I wouldn't say your brother is TA though. I'd say your parents are. Not intentionally. Parents make mistakes. They have been guarding him from reality. They haven't done him favors here. Life sucks, reality is harsh, not prepping someone for it just makes it worse."

I'm 24 with no kids, but to get sterilized, most doctors would require my husband's permission, and I don't have a husband. So how this procedure could have happened is a little confusing.

Like don't need to attack him about it but you also don't need the shelter him from the fact that all women need their pussy licked occasionally.  Or get tough and be the dom.

Forcing this upon him is selfish on her part. I get she's probably hurting, but when you're a parent, you pain is secondary to your kids well being. He has said he isn't ready. Wait until he is. And it is your fault for not dragging the kids through a prison? Screw that. You saved them a lot of trauma. No. Keep doing what you are doing. Maybe his mom can write an apology letter and send it as a starting point. But then take the letter and digest it in therapy."

Though its unlikely you'll learn more about how to do your job, maybe you'll learn more about the history or people who have worked in the field. She was trying to be optimistic and open and learn about your thing and you shut her down. Also, you are 23. You aren't that advanced at anything kiddo. I say this as a 24 year old. I have been studying music since I was 5. Religiously. Hours a day. And I will forever be a student. Yes music is more expanse with more history. But my point is, that to ever think you are done learning, especially at a young age, is truly ridiculous. A bit of humility would go a long way in you. And your girlfriend just got punched in the face with your lack of humility, so of course she's being cold towards you. You just changed her whole view of you. And not positively. Girls are not impressed by guys who claim to know it all. Girls adore guys who are open to new experiences and learning new things and can be humble."
