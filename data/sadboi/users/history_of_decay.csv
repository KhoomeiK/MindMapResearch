I don't have a problem with drinking but I have an on and off relationship with heroin, and when I don't do heroin all my other drug uses escalate. Again, not good advice, but there is some truth to it.

FYI I have no formal education in english/literature but I read a lot, and english is not my first language so I have a hard time expressing myself..

I don't think the dialogue between Leticia and Vonnegut is very organic. It feels forced, and written by someone that has no experience of that kind of relationship (lol i'm not saying you've never been laid, it's just how i read it). 
You write in a very gritty way, without moral judgement, and I really like the way how you use metaphors to describe how very mundane things of life are disgusting to the protagonist. And vice versa, how some of the things in life which normal people enjoy, the protagonist finds revolting. This truly is how a mind of an addict works. It is believable, it's depressing and it's beautiful. 
The dialogue and the whole relationship between Leticia and Vonnegut on the other hand seems inorganic, forced and very two dimensional. Why does she love him? She's 22 years old, a stripper, and she's never kissed, and moments later she's a dope fiend? English is not my first language so I have hard time expressing myself. It's cool how the relationship is in juxtaposition between Vonneguts ""other"" life, but the contrasts are a bit much I think. I don't know if this is helpful because I don't have any concrete suggestions to how you should change this, but I think you definitely have it in you to make the relationship and dialogue a bit more three dimensional. Maybe have a chapter just devoted to her, without Vonnegut in it?"
