SuicideWatch,f6l8rbg,t3_drsrsp,1572933029.0,"The latest ill go is one day before you, on the 30th. I think I will try to live my life as much as possible before the time comes but for sure wont live past my birthday which is mid January."
SuicideWatch,f6j687h,t3_drgb3w,1572889801.0,"Honestly, how can it get better when youve depleted all your emotional capacity to make it better? The future could be an escape but it will never get better until we are better now. Close to impossible. I agree."
SuicideWatch,f6e4g0u,t3_dqty6a,1572800060.0,"Its hard to say how people react. You never know how big of an impact you have on someone until youre gone. I wish there was a way to prepare our love ones. For me, I have indivisual notes prepared and I might film myself when im in a good state and explain my thoughts and my reason. Sometimes I think its easier to inform them it will happen soon instead of leaving without any warning. I think thats what makes suicide so hard on people around us."
SuicideWatch,f6bxmme,t3_dqt1h6,1572779731.0,"Dont be in a rush to. Keep trying to find something you want to do each day. Doesnt have to be big but keep looking. I think its good you are afraid. It means theres a part of you thats willing to give living a chance. Trust me when you hit your lowest and youre mind is ready (to go) fear and doubt becomes nonexistent. You are at your low now but i think its still shallow enough to get back up. I hope you give living one more chance, theres nothing else you can lose."
SuicideWatch,f6b1vnj,t3_dqtuqw,1572766793.0,Hope to hear from you tomorrow.
SuicideWatch,f6ajdsa,t1_f68p0pu,1572757735.0,"Its a face ive put on so much, Ive believed it. But I am a forgiving and loving person. But sometimes I set myself up for the worse so I dont get hurt. Usually it never goes downhill but almost everything I do, I dont put my heart into it. I know for a fact my heart is fragile. I think at this point its destroyed."
SuicideWatch,f6999zl,t1_f68f3n0,1572738612.0,"The pain doesnt necessarily scare me. But I am afraid of losing conciousness but aware time is ticking. Ive read of people being pulled backwards (towards death) but are capable of moving forward (to life). The feeling of moving through dark, murky water. I guess what I am afraid of is while I am in this state of unconciousness, I might reconsider living but by the time ive made my mind. It is too late. Then id be stuck in that dark murky water or nothingness. Id be stuck wanting to go back but trapped. I wont be able to cry or sleep just be alone with my thoughts on a loop."
SuicideWatch,f697hxm,t1_f67scw5,1572737335.0,"Are you afraid as well? Im curious what your  perspective is like. Today the thought made me unsure if my issues are fixable. I am afraid  my afterlife would be like how dreams are. You are spectating yourself from behind. Except this dream is endless if this sleep is endless. I am afraid these negative thoughts will remain with me as I walk alone in nothingness. Im afraid ill remember my family, my friends, my brother and regret ending my life. I might miss them so much id want to go back but never be able to. I dont want to be a prisoner left with my thoughts. I want to be free from them."
SuicideWatch,f60z4bu,t3_dq3syb,1572629350.0,What happened on september? If you dont mind me asking. But ya I feel this and its horrible. Getting small doses of hope followed by anxiety about the future. Its honestly so much easier to think about letting go than gathering up enough energy to keep going. Being on auto pilot sucks.
SuicideWatch,f5xe3as,t1_f5qzbtx,1572539473.0,I dont know about that. Im just anxious about my future right now because my life has been a constant getting by with back up plans are back up plans. At this point in my life now Iam out of a back up plan. And i just cant muscle enough energy to do or come up with something. So its become easier to not think anymore.
SuicideWatch,f5tptio,t1_f5titts,1572462620.0,I like going for hikes. It clears my mind. But once i get home its back. I know I have a lot of time left but I feel like right now Im just in such a bad state with myself that I cant even imagine living beyond my birthday. Itll just remind me another year I wasted doing nothing.
SuicideWatch,f5ti6e6,t1_f5th1bz,1572459177.0,"I have been pulled back and forth from going on and ending my life that I cant fully enjoy the things I like doing. Now, I find myself just sleeping around going to work and repeat."
SuicideWatch,f5rfm7w,t1_f5qzhem,1572393588.0,Age is definitelt my biggest insecurity. I feel like I am running out of time and I am doing things so late. Thats also adding on to me being insecure. Sometimes I think i used so much energy trying to be positive all the time that I have no more energy to do things  to get my life in order. I guess the thought of ending my life is just so much easier. The state of not having to think anymore. But it is going to be hard for my family. Thats the biggest pitfall. Should i be miserable for them to be just okay.
SuicideWatch,f5qycat,t1_f5qofei,1572385110.0,"I am happy I found them, they dont know the kind of baggage I have, but I know and I feel like its unfair for them to have to deal with me if it does come out. Because they seem to have their life figured out and I am over here struggling everyday to figure mine out."
SuicideWatch,f5qr09e,t3_dkfkaq,1572381573.0,"I feel this. I applied for a job I really needed to kickstart my schooling and career. I told myself, If I dont get this job you gotta just kill yourself, this is your last chance. Ended up not getting the job which left me balling. But now I am planning on leaving before my 24th birthday in 2 months."
