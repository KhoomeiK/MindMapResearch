Dissociation,fqoaj8f,t3_gk017w,1589510987.0,"there is no “more feminine” or “more masculine” if you are a woman you are a woman :) regardless of the mistakes of the universe. remember we exist here as individuals and that is the only real important thing to know. you’re an individual meant to be on the path meant for u. don’t let social constructs let u forget that. you know what you like, and your sexuality, and you know you’re transitioning to your true self :) the person you’ve always been! I was born a woman and I have the same conflicts at time with feeling too masculine or not as pretty/cute/feminine as my friends but i’ve realized the diversity in women is what makes each and every one of us so beautiful:) we represent a strength so much deeper than the surface! all your bravery and experiences help to make you your own beautiful <3 all my love to u during this time, godspeed :)"

Basketball,fg4reaq,t3_ewt5rj,1580509433.0,"tbh I feel like positions are mostly up to the player and the ability u know u have. i’m 5’10 20F, and they threw me on the baseline for a while bc i’m a traditional 4, and I played that my first two years on var but I knew I was a 2 actually and that’s how I finished my career. on a high as a 2. youre super new so u should develop ur game to the position you’d like. 5’9 as an incoming freshman is good size for a 4/5 on a jv team but come senior year when u level out at 6’1 or so you’ll be more built to run the 1/2? if this is a long term thing you’d like to do i’d recommend training as a 3 because it’s the perfect middle. then see what you gravitate more towards in terms of performance. do your stats show more on the wing and above or are u better in the paint?"
