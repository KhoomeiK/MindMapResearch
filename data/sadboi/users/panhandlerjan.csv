Anxiety,fqz34gt,t3_glq5t4,1589759065.0,I know that anxiety totally sucks. I try to remember that in the building over people dont even know me. Nothing I do in this building is so important the next company over is going to hear about it. And the smallness I feel from it is liberating.
AskReddit,fqyvhx1,t3_glp3ax,1589755260.0,The human brain and body. There are so many elements at work. So many things dependent on sustaining a living breathing body and so many emotions from within that body. It is fascinating.

addiction,fgxtlec,t3_f0pb57,1581176496.0,As long as you keep quitting you are on a recovery path. Dont think about the fuk up think about the sober time and do it again.
addiction,fgxt5wn,t3_f0rcv8,1581176433.0,I have had a similar path of life. I started an iop and it really helped me understand addiction and find out why I needed to be high all the time. I also found started dealing with my trauma. It is hard. Some days I dont think I will make it but I have tools now to help me cope. Reach out of you need anything :)

addiction,f9eu6r2,t3_e4o8x1,1575251674.0,Man I feel you. I've been sober for 47 days. The first few weeks were easy but now everything is a trigger. I think about it all the time. I like you dont want to stop trying however it is exhausting. Just know you arent alone and you are fighting the right fight.
addiction,f7o8oh7,t3_dx1czc,1573923009.0,I am very similar and am on naltrexone. I was suspicious at first but not only did it reduce cravings but if I do slip it makes it so if I take a benzo I don't feel anything. I would recommend talking to your dr about it.
Anxiety,f74eo9e,t3_dubotu,1573401372.0,I struggled with this for a long time. Look into mindful meditation. It has done wonders. It takes about a week of practice but if you can spend 2 minutes twice a day just closing you eyes and paying attention to your breath you should start to see a difference. Read the book mindful meditation.
addiction,f17ww01,t3_d878lw,1569249464.0,"So I am also going through this journey and about a month ago had the same thoughts. In sobering up I'm beginning to realize it actually isnt so bad. If nothing else the sense of accomplishment from doing something rather than nothing is helpful. 

Join a group or go to a therapist. Begin to untie the knots and start to enjoy. You obviously want to make s change or you wouldn't have posted. Quit running and face the reality. It is hard but the burden being lifted is helpful."

DrugsOver30,eyve1a5,t1_eyvdirb,1567490163.0,"You are right. I dont think it is negatively affecting my life. I feel like if anything it is less intensive than anti depressants and more flexible. Okay, that makes me feel better."

DrugsOver30,eyv6c94,t1_eyv5pmp,1567482035.0,"Yes it definitely was the near death that caused this issue. And then it was fine until I went to that meeting and totally sounded like an addict while explaining I'm fine. And then I felt guilty listening to others stories, thinking I shouldn't be there. But for some reason the people at the meeting really felt I should lol which makes sense if you dont know me or this story and just keep hearing someone say ""no really I have it under control."" And then I just got confused in my head I guess. Like is it an issue?? I dunno."

Anxiety,epbqa4x,t3_bufu07,1559145746.0,Yes I understand. Just last week this happened to me for the first time. I had been ignoring the lingering signs of what was becoming a nervous breakdown. I went to my car cried hysterically and explained to my manager I'm not sure what is wrong but I think I'm going crazy. I went to urgent care. I have a meeting with a psychologist today. It really is like a little cloud hovering above you. Worst thoughts ever.  You are definitely not alone.

Yah the valium is definitely a bit much. And the dr said very short term. I will look into the cbt and SSRI."
Anxietyhelp,eoo0w5t,t1_eonzt3r,1558726423.0,Thank you so much. This really makes sense. I do have an apt next week and valium for right now from my dr. I've never been on medicine like this and wow my brain feels calm and still. It is a relief.
relationship_advice,eoenzue,t3_brkfc2,1558502178.0,Just approach it as maybe you would benefit from an outside perspective because you truely care about saving the relationship. See if you can get him to go to an initial sessions and then discuss afterward if you want to proceed. I know many people who have saved their relationship and some who it torn theirs up. But every relationship is different.
