He stays at home all day long, watches series, works out every day 2+ hours, cleans cooks and does house chores.

And I'd kill for him to have other people. To have friends. In my first  relationship I was just like that. My second relationship was open, because I wasn't gonna be faithful and I didn't want to be unfair. We both enjoyed it. I had to process a thousand negative feelings and learn compersion. Now this is my third and my longest and I'd kill for him to have other people.

I'm his only friend. I'm his only outlet of communication, frustration, love, anger, anxiety... And don't get me wrong I love him to the moon and back. When I'm depressed he's there for me. I was 130kgs and he brought me below 100. In the borrowing personality traits, I went vegan because he did. A thousand etcéteras.

And yet I'm his only person with whom he has an emotional attachment. From your point of view, you'd love this, by what your post says. I'm ENTP and he is INFP. Maxed out compatibility.

I'm epileptic, that's a neurological one. Then I've got traits of ASPD, Borderline and Codependent, and I've got DID.

In order of importance: epilepsy, DID, Borderline, Codependency, ASPD.

Of those last three I rank highest on border. The other two are about the same, so no hierarchy.

BPDSOFFA,f6tmhm0,t1_f6r5xho,1573151142.0,"Look, girl, I'm into poliamory. The realistic objective that you should aim to is not monogamy or poligamy. That's part of the contract and it depends on both parts agreeing to what they're feeling. The contract should be revised periodically and convened between all the people in the relationship.

The one thing that is not optional, and not only that, but it also can't depend on ""these days"", ever, is communication. Healthy communication, talking things out. Everything. I've got a six year old relationship. We've been open, closed, Poli, you name it. Now we're in monogamy again after about a year of Poli. We both agreed to it, and when we were Poli we would always tell each other about what we were doing and with who and what we were feeling...

What's really troubling to me is that he's not willing to allow what he's not willing to give. What is that shit of I wanna have other girls but my girls can't have other guys. _rolls eyes_ talk about macho.

One of the key concepts of a successful non monogamic relationship is compersion. Go make a Reddit search of that term and see what comes up. It's feeling good about your SO doing things they like and enjoy. I'm glad you're swimming. I'm glad you're painting again. It's cool you had a great time with that guy you met in the subway. 

But if you're not so sure, if you go along just because your SO can't do being faithful, maybe they can't do being honest either, and *that's* the recipe for disaster. Many BPDs cant stand the idea of a friend being friends with someone else. So if you're one of those you really shouldn't go for anything other than monogamy, because compersion will be a difficult tool for you to develop, and it's critical for success. If you're not happy about your boyfriend exploring relationships with other girls, then stick to monogamy."

So why did it go unnoticed? Many reasons: first it may have been a time of the day with slow movement. Second if someone downvoted you soon after you posted on then that makes it loose on the default hot tab. Maybe you didn't have a catchy title. Maybe whatever you wrote didn't compel those who wrote it to participate. Do you consider a duty of those who come across your post to feel interested in it?

The point of posting isn't to find help but to build community. I bet your previous post may have had some audience if you'd left it up. And this post was interesting enough that it gathered some comments. Useful all of them.

But you're kinda preachy. I also went through your comment history and I feel you like conflict and complaining. I'm put off. So if your inquiry for a reason, devoid of the last sentence that reframes it as a call for what it should have happened, is sincere, is: because it didn't. 

If your last question is not rethorical, my answer is: because it's identity affirming. The point is not to be answered asap, this sub is nobody's *job*; so nobody is obliged to reply to anything. Pointing fingers on why your expectations weren't met is a bit guilt trippy.

So the polarity of being lvl 100, dangerous jail type with rage swings, or a mild lvl 40 of the depressed selfless being with crippling abandonment fear, or your run of the mill pallet town Pidgey alcoholic BPD. So consider the variance. And consider that the most vitriolic spiteful reactions come from people who have suffered some extreme cases. Even you are not really picking up this nuances, so how can they?  A personality disorder is not like a flu. It's not three signs and two hidden statistical abnormalities to remember. There aren't two of us alike.

But I also go there. It feels like a Gesell camera, where you get to watch people but can't comment or upvote or interact. Well, I don't.

Maybe you have none, maybe you have 1/2, maybe you have 3/4. And People here make this big theories about seemly thought experiments of what it is to live with 0 empathy. Which is fair, but I have a real time believing that what studies show More strongly in scientific settings is here almost completely turned backwards: the standard deviation of gaussian function. In the ASPD spectrum on the lack of empathy the dial is all around the spectrum but mostly falla somewhere in the middle. Like most color blind People mlx an are of the colour wheel and very few of them actually see in grayscale. Well you wouldn't ever guess it here. Almost all stories are a copypasta echo chambered bullshit where everybody is a joker wannabe. But there's zero personal vulnerable open up and tell your shit stories like on other community subs. Which is understandable, you can't ask empathy from the empathless, but you'd think the confirmation bias would act a little less incisively in all this wankers that claim to be more rational than most."

It can be sorted by votes, pages, year of publication, many etcs. You can create booklists and then figure out what you would like to chew next. I'm in a mood for a bestseller, click, most editions+most votes. I'm in a mood for a hidden gem, click, few votes best puntuation. I want remix. Click, remix genre, top voted. I love Goodreads use it all the time."
Codependency,f6af7v3,t3_dqjsk2,1572756020.0,"I've been reading hundred pages a day for a couple of months now. The method used is very... Special. It involves downloading balabolka, finding the ebook, and make it balabolka read it. It highlights words as it says them, and has a speed dial. So you read and listen at the same time following a blue highlight as it goes. I'm on speed ten now. Sounds maddening when you first experience it but if you become used to it it's just as engrossing as reading always was. The good thing is it'll throw you the time it takes so you now that for this short story you'll be in it for 5'. I've went through the entire borges short stories, then Chiever, Damon Runyon, then started long Novels. :3 I'm on the last 300 pages of infinte jest and I'm going for the count of Montecristo next"

Epilepsy,f5plbb9,t3_dodyd8,1572362102.0,"I remember raising similar concerns at the time I was first given V.A. because my father and all my siblings have polycistic kidney. I had cycled through many many meds and none had helped. In the end he faced me with the choice: okay, what do you wanna risk, PK or permanent brain damage? I personally chose to stick with the VA. If you haven't gone through other meds then go ahead and insist.

But read the prospect, how much incidence does that have?"

BPD,f5ov2ea,t3_dodq1h,1572333858.0,"Whoa. Okay let's see. First, I understand what you are going through. My question is did you snapped at her at all? I had something similar happen to me once with someone I considered a good friend. They saw me on a specific situation that triggered them hard. I dissociated and went off on myself through self harm, broke a glass and just stayed there. I was barefoot and I just... Stayed. I don't remember it myself but he told me. Well it turns out that everyone has baggage. His mother had offed herself when he was eight and he was the one who found her. Seeing me like that brought him way too close to that day. He didn't really figured it out himself at the time, we were 16/ish, but I have recently received an email that went over that episode. Its not like we stopped being friends from one day to the next, but it was painful. He began treating me like garbage and after a while I just couldn't seek out his company anymore. He was always hurtful and mean towards me. So now, after years of wondering what the fuck, I get it.

So, 1 think they may have some baggage.

2 friends don't need each other. And shouldn't. The way you describe this relationship you make it sound like you're a sugar daddy kind of friend and that with you and indulges in a bender sort of friendship. That's not bad but if she had been partying hard by your side and that's your default style of slowly time with her then maybe that's what's so off-putting. Maybe, just maybe. So now if she's going earlier maybe that's a sign she wants to do more tame stuff. If she was working more before then she may have been thankful for the time of but now she doesn't need that time to decompress so she's trying to be more healthier overall. So maybe, just maybe, is not about you but about what you tend to take things towards one you're there.

How old are your kids? Why not instead of inviting her to weed and alcohol you take her to something earlier like plans with your kids? Something healthy and different. To be friendship had to be a song. If it's just one note it never really gets there."

sociopath,f5ocgi0,t1_f5krl0v,1572314792.0,"Yeah but don't expect empathy from this specific bunch of assholes. 

Here's the thing. There are pain receptors in the nose. Some have lots. Some have none. My dad can't smell a fart without vomiting. And I could swim in a pool of vomit and diarrea wondering what that Chung I just went by was without as much as a gasp. I have zero pain receptors in my nose. But I have a very fine sense of smell. Bad odors don't make me flinch, but I can distinguish the aromas behind their composition. There's a couple of studies relating depression and an impaired sense of smell."
