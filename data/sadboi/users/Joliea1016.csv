I definitely am for the idea of being in a committed relationship and being truly comfortable with someone. I watched a stupid reality tv show recently on Netflix about a group of girls and guys in a house and there is a rule that that they have to sustain  from any type of intimacy for a cash prize, if they break the rules they get money taken off. Along the way they go through workshops and learn about seeing people for who they are and it‚Äôs not about sex. It‚Äôs annoying that people are not really down for real connections and sex has to be a part of this whole thing. I really think you should do whatever you feel comfortable with!
