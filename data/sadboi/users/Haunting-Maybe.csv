Fencesitter,fqhp3lj,t3_gidu0n,1589381546.0,"A big reason I won‚Äôt have kids is because of this. Because I lack joy and desire and fulfillment in life. I think creating a new person in order to give your life meaning, to fill a hole in your life is quite frankly rude and irresponsible. Especially if you can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt do a good job providing for them. Not an opinion I tend to share freely because I don‚Äôt want to make people feel bad. I feel like not burdening another person with the hardships of existence is one of the best things I will do with my life."

SuicideWatch,fpwt9bp,t1_fpw5jib,1588969560.0,"It‚Äôs very difficult to find support... not ‚Äúsupport‚Äù. I‚Äôve gotten the ‚Äúonly I can help me‚Äù thing spun to me too. I‚Äôve been feeling very hopeless lately. I appreciate your comment, I kind of feel a little more validated in struggling, so thanks. I feel like that is what I would tell others if/when I feel well enough."
depression,fpvc5xe,t3_gfqlvd,1588941327.0,"Yes I have a very hard time focusing on even just watching a show, movie, YouTube videos... I spend pretty much all my time in bed looking at my phone. I can‚Äôt even carry on a conversation really. I‚Äôve been trying really to watch shows, just for something new. For the sake of trying. I always find myself pausing and hopping back on my phone. Makes me feel worthless."

SuicideWatch,fplmpq4,t1_fplmcql,1588715510.0,"Right? I pay my counselor $110 to talk about how I need to save my money and to look up coping techniques for anxiety on YouTube. Like thanks, that helps. Especially with the saving money thing. Ugh! Get this, I make $200 too much to qualify for Medicaid so my employer provided insurance costs me up the wazoo. Makes. So. Much. Sense."
SuicideWatch,fpllzjs,t1_fpllgnu,1588715124.0,"Amen. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to wind up homeless because I just can‚Äôt get it together. I work entry level jobs I don‚Äôt feel like I can keep up with and quit. Just hopping from one pile of shit to the next. I‚Äôm 26 and totally reliant on my father. Idk how I will find my way in the world without him. That aside? Life has been a lot of pain and unfairness. Not just for me, I can see how life has been so cruel and messed up for so many. I feel like the best thing I will ever do with my life is not create a new one. The suffering ends with me."
SuicideWatch,fpll8x2,t3_ge4tw1,1588714736.0,Yo. Same. Life feels like a rude joke to me. I worry that I will pay for having such an ungrateful attitude. I feel like I already am paying for it with the emotional anguish haa üòÖ
depression,fpk08m4,t1_fpjygru,1588685289.0,"I am diagnosed with Depression, General Anxiety and ADHD. But around the time I turned 25, I was out of counseling at that time, I think I may have experienced a hypomanic episode which I have brought up to my therapist but the therapist I‚Äôm seeing now I‚Äôve only seen I think 6 times? I was trying to get back in with my old therapist but unfortunately she was too booked up to see me. So it‚Äôs tough starting all over. I stopped going once I was off my dads insurance because of the cost. I have a lot of financial anxiety because I don‚Äôt hold down jobs and I have mental breakdowns that put me out of work. The only good thing to come of that is I save money. But it‚Äôs all very anxiety induced and obsessive. Spending money is painful even when it‚Äôs for my benefit. Counseling and medication feels like such a gamble and takes so much time. But I‚Äôm pretty desperate. I need to call today and see what my other insurance options can be."

Fencesitter,foq7z2o,t1_fopvby2,1587986180.0,"Right, so I think you‚Äôre looking for the word vehemently. The definition of vapid is ‚Äúoffering nothing that is stimulating or challenging‚Äù whereas vehemently means ‚Äúin a forceful, passionate, or intense manner; with great feeling‚Äù so vehemently childfree: intensely/passionately childfree...

See what I‚Äôm sayin?"
Fencesitter,fongzl5,t1_fongl43,1587919308.0,That wasn‚Äôt how I perceived it but I‚Äôm curious as to what their intended meaning is here. I can‚Äôt understand why someone would describe themselves as being ‚Äúvapid‚Äù in that context

Fencesitter,fomusw7,t3_g8b0th,1587904512.0,"Sorry, off topic but did you by chance mean to say something like vehemently childfree, instead of vapid? That didn‚Äôt make sense to me so I‚Äôm asking"
