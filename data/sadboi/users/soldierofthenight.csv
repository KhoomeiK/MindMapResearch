schizoaffective,fqb9krf,t3_ghcrc3,1589232973.0,"I've been with the same company for over 2 years now. It's my first major job and I'm only 25 so I don't really have much experience elsewhere. I've had 2 major episodes in that span and each time, my job has been very accommodating with helping me set up leave of a leave of absence for job security. I think I just really lucked out working where I do"
schizoaffective,fq7kzrq,t3_gh4tks,1589147786.0,"I'm fine with indica and hybrid, but I also can't smoke sativa. It increases the chances of me seeing and hearing things so I stay far away from it"

schizoaffective,fpsgwuj,t3_gex5cf,1588873278.0,"I'm pretty high functioning as well but I do find myself questioning everything sometimes. It's how I know I'm about to get bad. I'll question if something happened was real or if I just made it up. I'll questions people's motives and if they're just out to get me. I question what I'm seeing, because sometimes I see patterns or shadows that aren't actually there. It sucks so bad"

schizoaffective,fo0vvqw,t3_g4xun3,1587420742.0,I was actually near mania when I convinced myself I didn't need meds anymore. I stopped taking them for 6 months and then ghosted my psychiatrist and therapist. I didn't realize I was out of control until my manager told me that she would take me to HR if I didn't get back on my meds. That was last September
schizoaffective,fntwbim,t3_g3u9z1,1587249831.0,I am on new meds and I'm not sure if the dosage is off but I'll be fine for half the days and the other half be miserable. I'm gonna talk about it with my psychiatrist soon but it's causing me to not be in the best of places right now

bipolar2,f350mvh,t3_dfou21,1570665438.0,"When I can't trust my brain, my friends are there to convince me that my brain is wrong. I go through moments where I convince myself that my mental illness doesn't exist and I'm making it up for attention. When that happens, I stop taking my meds. My friends are the rock that keeps me from going over the edge. They're that outside voice that keeps me grounded."
