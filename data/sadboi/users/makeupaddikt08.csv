BPD,fr0u7jz,t3_glts1h,1589806842.0,"I've been lurking here for a few weeks, oddly enough thanks to TikTok. I have been in therapy regularly for several months but have a lifetime of diagnoses, including a misdiagnosis (confirmed by doctors) for Bipolar Disorder. When I did more research on BPD, everything just fit. The symptoms made sense. I had never read anything about my mental illness (depression, anxiety, PTSD) that made sense to me. I ticked off nearly every box. It has been a relief to know that maybe I don't have treatment resistant depression or anxiety. That this could be engrained and with proper diagnosis and treatment, I could live a more productive and happy life.

I mentioned BPD to my therapist at last weeks session and she gave me a very quizzical look and asked me why I thought I may have BPD. I explained and then we just kind of moved on. I'm not pushing for a diagnosis, but I feel it is worth exploring and intend of diving deeper with her this week to see what steps I need to take in order to proceed with an evaluation. 

I can say I so strongly identify and feel comforted by the posts here that I feel much less ""crazy"". Some of the protocols and reframing, etc I'm already practicing and they do help me tremendously. I'm looking forward to proceeding with an evaluation and until then, continuing to practice steps to help me, centered around BPD. I understand that self-diagnosis is not ideal but if the treatments are working then I'd rather be better than I was while I seek further professional help. 

Excellent post, OP. Thank you."

He deleted their texts. I was able to recover them because people are stupid and don't understand how backups work. 

I have their photos and messages. It is excruciating to my psyche. The things they said, the photos. He can never take that all back. He also lied initially about the  nature of the messages when he didn't think I'd find them. It took me weeks to read through them. He wouldn't answer my questions, and even if he did, he is and was a liar in my eyes. I got a majority of my questions answered in those messages. I'll never know the full extent of their physical affair but what I know is enough to go ahead and put the pieces together. Kissing and sitting on laps and groping and embracing and hand holding...he denies PIV sex and oral but there's enough there to go ahead and say they likely did those things or at least one of them, even though he says he knew that would be too far. They were even looking for places to live together, although he still insists that never happened and he wouldn't have done that. Like dude...I can fucking read. 

The fact that I:

 1. Have the messages 

2. Will never really know the full truth

...it blocks my process of healing in a way I feel is productive for me. 

I know where you are. I am there too. Here's to hoping we both find some sort of healing from the trauma and destruction these irrational, uncaring, consenting adults caused."

As a BS who is almost 10 weeks past Dday - this is definitely true. I am forever changed. I don't even recognize who I was 10 weeks ago and in some ways, that's good. I'm struggling in IC with who I am now and how I feel now, and it is too soon to really determine that. 

My WS is remorseful, in a way, but continues the self-pity game so hard that he cannot possibly be empathetic. He quit IC. He just avoids and deflects and refuses to communicate even though I need him to. He says how he feels doesn't matter. This is a negative cycle and unproductive for any healing of either party. 

OP, while you aren't able to reconcile, you can heal on your own. Self-pity is ok for a while but reflection and learning from your actions is wholly important to your healing. Do the work and keep doing it. It sounds like you're on a good path. Destruction didn't happen in a short period of time and rebuilding yourself won't happen in a short period of time either.  It takes a lot of time and sincere dedication to the work, reframing, abolishing negative self-talk, and learning that you aren't your past if you're sincerely committed to healing. Keep at it.

Would I do it again if I had it to do over again? Hell yes. My daughter is neurotypical and just a damn joy 24/7. Would I have planned better and not had them 15 months apart? Yes. If you have the ability to plan the pregnancy, do so. I was managing a newborn and a toddler when my son was first diagnosed. That meant a lot of doctors appointments, therapy, school integration...all while taking care of another tiny one and working. It was essentially like having twins and I was definitely not prepared for that aspect, along with meeting the needs of both children. OP, it sounds like you've already got a lot of foundations for your kiddo established, which is amazing. Keep that going :) 

Being a sibling of a special needs child has not been easy on my daughter. Her brother is pretty high demand and requires 24/7 care and supervision. We've had our challenges. I can safely say that we ensure that both kids have every opportunity possible and we have a great support system to make things happen. My daughter is incredibly insightful, patient, kind, witty, and has a deeper sense of the world, heads and tails above her peers. Her maturity level is much higher as well. We have to watch out for her mother hen moments and remind her that while being helpful is great, she isn't expected to manage her brother nor help with him at any time because she is a kid too. Still, she tries to be helpful when she can, as that's her nature.

When I was pregnant with my daughter, I did elect to have an amnio to check her genetics and detect any abnormalities early. I wasn't really that concerned but it seemed like a good idea. At 23 years old, I just figured it was gonna be what it was gonna be and we'd handle the worry if we needed to, when we needed to. When my daughter was a smaller child I elected to have her genetics tested to see if she was a carrier of the genetic syndrome. She is not and I am not, but their biological father was never tested so we are missing that piece. Based on testing, the genetics team suggests my sons abnormality was a gene mutation and not a deletion, so sporadic.  Still, it was important for me to make sure that should my daughter decide to start a family later in life, she was as well informed as possible.

IMO, go for it. Plan ahead. Be informed. At the end of the day, these are your little humans. Just love them like you would any child :)"

This is the video I used. I bought clippers right as this whole thing started so I could cut my son's hair (simple buzzcut) not thinking I'd be cutting my husband's hair too (traditional longer fade with a hard part). My husband is essential so he still has to work and he needed a haircut. This video worked amazingly well. I faded his longer and followed the lines his barber had nicely set at his last haircut. 

You can take hair away. You can't put it back. I kept the guard length conservative, not what they use in the video. I cut the top doing some light point cutting to debulk and not necessarily take off tons of length. There are several videos explaining point cutting as well. 

Good luck! I'm not a barber or cosmetologist but grew up in a salon and have a weird amount of hair knowledge. I'm almost 40 and my family still wishes I'd go to cosmetology school. Also, my husband's hair turned out great. Not as short and sharp as his Barber does (we miss Mr. Rudd's!!) but it looks good, is faded evenly, and did the trick :)"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fnhardo,t3_g1p2gu,1586958741.0,Tyler will reason with Cate that the only way to pay the money back will be for him to start doing porn. Gay porn. She will implicitly trust his professional opinion. She will write clickbait about it. Tyler will follow up with a brain shattering poem. Michigan Meth will soon follow.

There are a couple of others as well, but the softness if the Adome lace lingerie has been amazing and it doesn't pop little elastic threads when washed and overall washes well with Woolite in a lingerie bag. I've been really happy with it. I'll find links but I'm sure you can search the brand as well :)"

sexover30,fn6oay1,t3_fzmcrs,1586703975.0,"I deleted my original comment and rescind my initial well wishes.

Pretty shitty to bury the one-way poly info deep into the thread. Having your cake and eating it too is a shitty thing to do for the sake of security and having fulfillment elsewhere. Obviously the husband has a great sense of duty to his family and if allowing her to cheat keeps her happy, this poor guy is being chumped and needs to research the meaning of ""poly"". 

I hope the husband realizes his self-worth and gets out of this destructive relationship and finds someone happy with who he is as a person."

survivinginfidelity,fn3qrl4,t3_fyouzg,1586626092.0,Someone else said it - don't waste your time in limbo. I'm coming out of it now and cannot wait for this pandemic to be over so he can leave and I can go see my attorney to sign my papers. The attorney and I already completed them but I was unsure and didn't want to make any impulsive decisions. Hindsight is I should have signed and filed that day and requested a no contact order. I've wasted 5 weeks to see how I would feel and see what would happen. What happened is he continues to lie and I feel even more destroyed than Dday. I could have already been further along in the process had I nutted up and stopped listening to my heart and started listening to my brain.
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fn3p6bm,t3_fz7l0b,1586625196.0,"AP will probably lie to you too. You're dealing with two people with no conscience. With WS trickle truthing you, you won't be reconciling. 

I say this because this is what I am going through. 9 years together. Married 5. Dday was 6 weeks ago. He deleted their sexts before I could see them. I managed to recover them. He knows I know just about all of their conversations. I filled 64gb of jump drives full of their messages and photos. Every day more and more comes out. Granted, I already know but admittedly haven't had the time or energy to go through every single message. There's just too many. 

Yet WS continues to lie. Say things didn't happen that did happen. He still insists they didn't have any kind of sex but that's a lie too and I've got proof. He wants to reconcile. I've told him every time he reveals a new piece of information that is consistent with their messages, that he has been lying since Dday and before and reconciliation isn't possible since he is determined to continue to lie. 

Because he is a medic and we are in the pandemic, he apparently can't move out. I wish he would. I've asked. He says he ""can find a place to go he guesses"". Then he stays. He waves marital counseling in my face then never schedules. He says his therapist isn't helping so he is looking for a new one. Whatever. I don't care. I'm done with even reading the rest of the messages and hearing his lies. I simply just don't care how he feels or what he says anymore. He is a proven liar. His AP is a proven liar. His family enables him. His coworkers are liars as well (they all knew).

Your WS is a liar too. You'll never get the truth to just like I won't."

By the 2nd day, half the class was dismissed. On the 1st day it took 2 hours to get everyone signed in because people do not listen and panic or are completely computer illiterate. I colored in my coloring book and finished some nice pictures though. So that was cool."
