AskReddit,fb3b6zd,t1_fb352nc,1576468542.0,"Yep. I had a similar thing in college. My girlfriend was toxic and emotionally and physically abusive. One evening she started beating on me in front of my dorm because I had the audacity to be her DD, but I didn't drive fast enough and she peed herself. So I deserved to be a punching bag. The people passing by cheered her on. Nothing was done. This is just one episode from that cunt.

AskReddit,f8efert,t1_f8dreug,1574526527.0,"Yep. When I was a freshman in HS my dad underwent open heart surgery. Like, it was touch and go for real for a while.

I wasnt acting out, I wasnt disruptive. I was just, you know, depressed because my dad might die at any minute and I was a kid. After class a few times (this happened more than once) he would say sorry to me but that he was trying to make an example to others. Like fuck you man.

Edit: I should note that he knew the situation. He was well aware of it and even asked my sister (older than me) how my dad was doing...in retrospect he was probably asking not because he cared but to get ammo to use on me later in the day."

AskReddit,f8ec2ap,t1_f8dn766,1574524531.0,"Same. I was going to move in with my friends. They gave me the run around after I already had cancelled my other living arrangement plans. Then after they offer my promised room to the guy who was supposedly my best friend. I had to move in with my parents so I had a palce to live---fun times. 

Looking back it was clear I was never really a core part of that group. It suchs because I was the target of bullies in middle school (pre-teen years) so I didnt have any friends in the formative years of life when you move from childhood into more adult relationships. I finally (thought I did anyway) get friends in high school but I didnt understand that they didnt really consider me anything other than a person on the outside---a tertiary part of their group. They would hang out without me, etc. Once we got to college ( a lot of us wen to the local Uni) they would hang out with a guy who lived on the same floor as me, a few doors down, but wouldnt even stop by to say hey. 

I did my best to be a true friend to them but they were never there for me when I needed them the most. In fact, they went out of their way to exclude me. Yeah fuck those guys."
AskReddit,f2xrb9r,t3_depetq,1570481622.0,"Depression and anxiety, honestly. 

People think alcoholics are like the ""social butterflies"" and ""life of the party"" type people who just happened to get addicted. You read recovery articles online and its stuff like ""will I still have all my friends if I dont go out every-night with them?"" or ""how will I keep up my amazing fun life full of beautiful things if I cant have a beer once in a while?"" These, I assume, are written by people who know nothing about alcoholism or substance abuse. It is what they *think* the condition looks like because to them, having tons of friends and accidentally getting addicted on ladies night at the bar is the *only* way it would happen. But for me and for a lot (and I mean a lot) of others drinking and drug abuse was not about having a good time, it never was,  it was about turning off the negative thoughts and feelings. 

I would describe my normal state, how I feel constantly on an average day, as mix of the following two things: A guy on the electric chair 30 seconds before they throw the switch, and like its the last dance at senior prom and you leave for bootcamp on Monday.

Add to that mixture depression which can keep you from even the most basic tasks, like you could save the world with the flip of a switch but the depression keeps you from getting up. Anxiety makes you feel like you must desperately do everything, all things, right now at this very minute.Depression keeps you from doing anything. That is a horrible mixture. 

So, what did I do to turn off the constant D-Day in my brain? I drank alcohol. I didnt do it to be the life of the party or to be social or have an amazing beautiful time with wonderful friends. No, I did it to turn off my emotions. I would drink as fast and hard as I could to just calm the storm. People commit suicide because the pain is so intense that not existing is a better alternative to it. Thats what people jump out of burning buildings. They know they wont survive, but the fire hurts so much that plunging to their death is relief. Drinking provided a bit of relief because the alternative was that window jump into eternity. 

That is what drinking is for me. A way to just turn off my emotions for a while. For calm. To just make it stop. 

I am on medication now. That helps immensely. Everyone feels some depression and anxiety in their life, so they think its the same as when someone has clinical depression and anxiety. But thats like telling someone with stomach cancer that you know how they feel because you had bad gas once. Its not the same. And sometimes, self medicating by just making it turn off is preferable to the raw emotions and mental anguish. 

thats why I drank."

The easiest example is stuff like what the Brits and us broadcast to the soviet bloc during the cold war. One I found most interesting is the FBI got butthurt at Desi Arnaz over the portrayal of the FBI in an Eliot Ness tv series he put together. Its not a conspiracy theory or nefarious, just that the government asks that certain norms, values, information be portrayed  and others...not so much. Like what the FCC does."

There is a laundry detergent named SOS. Back in the 90s they had a commercial where the person doing the laundry played the morse code for SOS  to receive laundry help. I always imagined that the gubment asked/paid the detergent company to have that in the commercials;  as a way to instruct regular folks on what the morse code for SOS was in case they would ever need it. Similar to how cop dramas serve the role of educating the public on elements of the judicial system.
