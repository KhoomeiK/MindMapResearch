BPDmemes,fcexokv,t1_fce75ef,1577624649.0,I'm currently watching You too! I feel exactly the same way. The way he convinces himself that he's a good person hits me so hard and now i'm scared that I'm actually a really bad person and i'm just convincing myself i'm good
BPD,fbly2th,t3_edun8t,1576973291.0,"panic attacks are so much worse!! at least dissociation isn't always such a negative experience, panic attacks are just hell!"
BPD,fbim4yp,t3_edkxar,1576905306.0,"honestly i feel the same way. i'm struggling to maintain friendships and make friends. i push my friends away because i hate myself so much i don't understand why they would want to be friends with me. i push everyone away for a same reason because in my head they already resent me, and so why would i want to try and be friendly and fun and everything if i know i'm just the worst person ever and they're going to hate me."
BPD,fbew5b3,t3_eczf4q,1576795366.0,yeah i understand. i honestly hate myself so much that it's the law of nature that every one hates me i hate me too. i don't eat because i hate myself and i don't want to feed her (me). i would obviously like to learn to love myself one day or whatever but i genuinely do not think that's possible.
BPD,fbbwh9e,t3_e4qkql,1576709690.0,"i'm 19 and i have felt like i was stuck at being 12 for a while now. my friends have noticed this too, that i act younger. I need people to do things for me and take care of me, because i really do feel like a 12 year old in the body of a 19 year old. sometimes i feel even younger, like 8 or lower. I just need my friends and people around me to take care of me like i am 8-12"
BPD,fbblipc,t3_ecifsc,1576702942.0,"Yeah I do this to my friends. I try to constantly push their buttons and see how much they're willing to tolerate. I have this intense need to see where there limit is, where the point is when they will leave me. They say they won't leave me but I say ""we'll see"" and i try to prove that they will leave. I upset my friends just to make sure that they still respond and care about me, and i get extremely frustrated when they don't respond the way I want them to."
BPD,fbbfjyd,t3_ecezdi,1576699395.0,i do this so much! i thought i was the only one. i feel like i'm constantly in my head so much and my thoughts are constantly spiraling. i feel like i have too many thoughts.
