AsOneAfterInfidelity,fqy6a4b,t3_glk9h4,1589743305.0,"Hi I am not sure I know what you mean by get defensive really quick?

For me for the longest time I would threaten our relationship. It became my go to and that was really bad. 

So I forced myself to stop and now instead demand space to process my feelings and to talk not in the heat of the moment 

The thing is people always say that without trust you can not have a relationship but what you have to trust in is that the person who cheated is committed to you and the relationship. Not to trust that they will never cheat again because people make mistakes and do the wrong thing. 

I won’t ever trust him the same again but I have learned to move on from what he did. 

I think though that I love him unconditionally and that is not healthy but it is what it is. 

He has never cheated again and moved heaven and earth to show how much he loves me post d day, 

It is a tough journey , we are 7 years post. You never really get over it in some ways."
