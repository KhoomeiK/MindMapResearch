Assistance,fqofv07,t3_gk0zlm,1589514302.0,"I have a feeling I had it back in mid February. Before it was a known big thing in Canada. I had been to a mini conference with a bunch of people from different parts of Ontario and Quebec, from all levels of jobs, private business owners to government. On the way home, I was having a lot of pain and it was impossible to breathe. I was curled up almost crying in the car and then falling asleep from being so exhausted with it (long drive home).

I got back to my house, bent over in pain and managed to curl up in bed and find an ok position to sleep. I woke up the next day, still impossible to breathe, I had sudden congestion and was coughing up phlegm for a few days. Eventually, it calmed itself. I live alone and couldn't bring myself to a doctor at the time and thinking it was just some sort of one off thing, i tried to just wait it out. I did and I was ok.

I have asthma issues. I think I have other lung issues, stemming from when I was born, my mom was told to lay me face down on an exercise ball and roll me back and forth to help encourage proper breathing. 

I'm ok now. Don't panic. Follow all the rules and suggestions laid out by doctors. Drink plenty of water, get plenty of rest and stay home. Breathe. You're going to be ok :)"

You do nothing but stay home and enjoy retirement now. The only difference with what's going on for you is you have to stay home because you're in danger of getting sick. You're secure with your pension. If you were living just fine on it before, you can live on it just fine now. This is Canada, you have free healthcare.

Feel out how she's acting - if she's ramping it up, show her the there's less and less that you'll take, especially if it's something you've explicitly said no to.

It's really up to your dynamic. Depending on the strictness she likes. If she does one thing, it's not necessarily as big of a no-no as another thing. So you might wait on one, but not on another. 

The whole point is you both ENJOY the dynamic - all punishment is in a small way a funishment because the brat is seeking it out by bratting. She's getting a rise out of you because she likes it, give her something to show her you know what she's doing, and she better think twice next time (she will... But do it anyway cuz duh). Spanking isn't the only thing. If you want to throw her off and not fully give in, something like doing lines is boring and annoying, and from that, whether she does well or not, you either give a little reward or punish her further.
