My childhood was so appalling, gruesome and disappointing that I swore that I’d do everything differently and give my children the knowledge I wished I had. I was 9 when I began thinking this. 

I’m a dad now and I gave my teenage son all the knowledge I desperately wished I had.

Consent, how to give oral sex to a woman, consent, what the labia looks like, consent, the size and shape of the clitoral organ, consent, I had him practice putting a condom on a banana, consent and the names of the 6 parts of the vulva. Did I mention the importance of consent?

Everything. It’s an ongoing conversation too.

I think committing to a professional therapist to help you process through the challenges of marriage before you get married is a genius decision.

I did that before I got married and it made a huge difference. I’m currently in personal therapy for PTSD from childhood and the habit of leaning into asking for help and doing the work to grow is the make-or-break variable.

Mental health counseling has been instrumental in the happiness of my marriage and the happiness of my kids.
