ptsd,f6qf8mw,t3_dsknp8,1573076173.0,"The world kinda fades out around me, but not in like a visibly physical way? If that makes sense. I kinda just stop being able to focus on things around me, first is usually sight. Things get weirdly ""bright"" is how I always describe it. Which makes me shut or squint my eyes which then really shuts my sight down. Then hearing goes in that its incredibly hard to actually understand the sounds around me. Since most of my flashbacks are triggered by yelling or screaming or just generally sound. For instance if someone is talking to me I can hear a noise but cant understand whats being said. Like the adults in the Peanuts series or something. Its just noise.

Meanwhile I'm just turning further and further inward. I want to describe it more like- remembering the trauma. Its intrusive and sudden and I cant stop it from invading my head. Like quicksand or something, I cant drag my thoughts away and struggling seems to sink my brain further into the trauma. The strength of it can vary. Like just remembering a specific phrase or incident or something just playing on loop. Or it could be like im actually there but viewing it sort of out of body. Watching it all happen to me again.

Since I'm SUPER unaware of my surroundings or my own physical state I only have what my girlfriends told me I'm like outside of my brain. Shes said I'll freeze and stare off into space while hyperventilating before I start curling into the fetal position while covering or clawing at my face. I'm vaguely aware of it but I know I tend to repeat ""I'm sorry"" a lot. 

Truthfully im not sure where a flashback ends and a panic attack begins because they just go together for me. Ive vomited on a few occasions. 

When I get drawn out of my head from the flashbacks im still very vulnerable and could slip back into it. I feel like a child but I think thats because thats when my trauma took place. I'm aware that I'm in my own home, but everything feels huge - or I feel small. Like in stature I mean. I think it also might be because i tend to be hunched over but its a weird feeling nonetheless. I feel like im in someone elses house. I tend to snap my head around me because im also in a constant state of dread- that impending doom kind of feeling. I have a huge distrust of dark spaces in this state. Its here that I also tend to have auditory or visual hallucinations. Or maybe im just misrepresenting things I hear in the distance or cant quite make out. I'm not sure. Ive heard yelling where there wasnt any- or seen faces or movement where there wasnt. Its very disorienting.

I'm lucky to have my girlfriend though. She walks me through grounding exercises or helps lead me through the house so I know I'm safe.

Anyway, thats what flashbacks are like for me. Thanks for this question honestly, ive never written it down before but this felt kind of like- a good exercise in introspection, which im terrible at."

You did what needed to be done to keep her safe. As others have said, your job is done. You need to take care of yourself as well. I'm not a doctor in any way but I'd recommend a therapist for yourself as well. You will need to be the strong pillar for someone who experienced a mental break, and that's a huge weight to carry. Also don't torture yourself responding to the hate and ignorant trolls on these posts. They say nasty things just to get a reaction, don't give them the satisfaction.

offmychest,etrur4v,t3_cd1xu5,1563129533.0,"I know you're getting your ear talked off left and right from people. And I'll tell you I agree with most of the comments here. Don't do it.

I'm a kid whose parents never split because there's stigmas against separated families. I WISH my parents had divorced. I prayed for that shit every day growing up. My mom was a piece of shit. I watched her ruin everything about who my dad was, she molded him into someone else. 

The only fond memories I have of my dad are when I was super young and their relationship was still new. We used to play game together. Ledgend of Zelda was our thing. It was nice having a dad then. But eventually we stopped playing games together, because my mom thought it was childish and she didn't like video games. To this day I still refer to him as a ""brick wall"" because that's what he became. Sure he was there physically. But he wasn't my dad. He was made to wait on my mom, do what she said, he lost whatever hobbies he had before. I don't even know what he likes to do anymore. It was miserable growing up around that. I wish he'd divorced so he could've had a good life of his own, so I could know who he was before my mom messed him up.


You think your doing this for the kid, but truth is bud, your kids gonna be just as miserable as you. Don't do it to them. You can be a great father in a separate parenting situation. Your kid will be able to take breaks from their mom and they'll get to see the you that's happy and healthy. Kids pick up on that shit.

Also go to therapy or talk to your doctor about your depression. Life can be better."

A cousin found him while at work at a warehouse off of a highway. He spotted the little guy slinking around out in the rain. Setting up a bucket for shelter all he had to offer the kitten for food was a slim Jim. The next day he bought an actual bag of cat food and would proceed to feed him for 5 days hoping the mother would come by and get him. On the 6th day when the kitten was still just hanging out in the bucket he decided to take him to the family bbq. Where my fiance and I fell in love with the little guy.

But I already have a fur baby so I was very dedicated to convincing my neighbor and best friend to take the guy in. She's wanted a cat for the longest time so she wasn't hard to sway.

So now I get to babysit this cutie while she's at work >:D"

relationship_advice,etj7jgg,t1_etj5zx2,1562867726.0,"Oh yeah things have improved a lot since then! Now that I know where the aversion came from, I don't internalize it, so I can focus on helping her cope and get around the blocks without feeling like it's something wrong with me. That for one was probably the biggest relief of it all. And because I've been more mindful of her I think it's helped her break down some of her trust issues. Honestly now I feel like we're probably at what most people's sex is like. No one's hurting anyone's feelings and we're both comfortable talking to each other about sex related things. There's no pressure to have sex, or not have sex, it's just a fun thing we can do together now! 

We use condoms and dental dams and while I've 100% offered her the option of even going so far as to use some kind of disposable glove for the fluid aversion, shes loosened up about it now. Maybe things like those would even help the OP if they think it would help.

There are times when she gets overwhelmed, but like I said, I realize it's not a problem with me and not to take it personally. It's helped me also loosen up."
relationship_advice,etht6mv,t3_cbqd4j,1562826639.0,"So I used to have similar problems with my fiance. She was very sex aversed and we've realized she's just flat out hates all the fluids involved with sex. Which sucks because we're both vagina owners. I got to a point of frustration a couple times. I felt rejected, like maybe she didn't really love me, or she hated my body. Fun stuff. I'm sure you're probably having the same feelings. 

I sat down with her and we talked. I explained exactly how I felt, I told her I loved her but I didn't feel like I was loved back. We found that she had buried some trauma involving an ex and sex. It's been a battle. Sometimes we have great sex, other times we have to stop abruptly because something freaked her out. She's also been formally diagnosed with anxiety and the medication has helped reduce her stress and disgust when it comes to sex.

So, my recommendations. Try talking to her, as non confrontational as possible. Express to her that you're hurting over this, be vulnerable and open. It could be a simple miscommunication problem. Where your values aren't aligned. Maybe sex just isn't important to her and she doesn't realize she's hurting you. Once you've said your peace listen to her. Ask her what you can do to help make this work, because it's important to you and you want this to work. If she offers no explanation or refuses to talk this out with you, though be mindful to be gentle about it. Id set an end deal of either both of you seeking couples counseling or both seeing separate therapists of your own. Of course you can't force her and at that point it's up to you and how much of your happiness your willing to sacrifice for the relationship.

I hope things work out for you either way."

guineapigs,eqfgwip,t1_eqfc7ij,1560020602.0,"It's alright of course, we all start somewhere! Generally breeding will be stressful for the female in this situation because they are new to each other. Being in a new enviorment and immediately  impregnated could open her up to several complications, either losing the pups, general birth issues, or the stress making her more susceptible to illnesses. Piggies in general are already a little fragile when it comes to illnesses, stress can compound that. And then the illness can be passed on to Lupin.

Not to mention breeding can get out of hand very fast. Not only can babies begin breeding roughly a month after being born but the mother can get pregnant again only 15 hours after giving birth. If your unable to literally be constantly watching them or have separate cages for all the females, you will quickly be over run with cavies. 

Even experienced owners are wary of breeding because it requires a lot of time, resources, and money to make sure all the pigs come out healthy and happy. The increase in pigs means more food, and pups require alfalfa hay and extra nutrients as they grow and develop.  Meanwhile alfalfa isn't recommended in large amounts for the adults, so you'd have to keep them separate.

While I don't consider it a con having to spend more time with your piggies, if you're already having any trouble managing your relaxation time with pigs it will only get worse. And again, if separate cages are not used then you will have to watch them constantly to intervene in breeding attempts.

And resources you generally use already will only bump up. How much bedding do you go through,it will be used much faster. How much vitamin C will you need to keep up with the new pigs-of which you will probably have to triple for mom when she gets pregnant? Are there enough fresh veggies to supplement all the pigs diet? Is there enough pellets? What about hay? You'll need the regular Timothy for Lupin and alfalfa for mom and pups. Is there enough space? The current cage is only big enough for two, cavy litters can be from 2-4. And while you might be able to give the babies away to friends and family, the issue with Mom being able to breed again in 15 hours comes into play. You'll eventually be unable to get rid of all the babies they have.

I know this seems overwhelming, but that's why most people don't get into breeding them. For the sake of your piggies health and happiness, consider getting one of them spayed or neutered. That way they can focus on just being your pets!"
guineapigs,eqf7uce,t3_by91q6,1560016498.0,"Are you breeding them? Not to be rude but you seem inexperienced with guinea pigs, and for the health of the piggies, you probably shouldn't breed them.

And unfortunately this alone is stressful for the female. The male guinea pig will be ruthless in his attempts to mate and stress her out. And left unsupervised fights may break out.

Until you get Lupin fixed it would be best to keep them separate, not only to prevent pups, but also so they can slowly get used to each other. You will need to have Luna in a cage with a roof and bottom or Lupin will jump in or push his way under.

And finally, more hides would make them more comfortable in their hopefully separate cages."
