SuicideWatch,fpwrutc,t1_fpwkkes,1588968826.0,Well ill be leaving this forum then. All im seeing is a bunch of people wallowing with eachother in their depression. Doing nothing and not offering support to someone admitting they are days away from suicide isn't ok.  I literally tried to kill myself because of this exact thing. Depression is different for everyone and thus the needs of someone with depression is all different meaning there are quite a few people who would benefit from encouragement and resources. This forum doesn't help people with depression cope with depression which shoudl be the whole point of reaching out. I will never ever stop loving and supporting and offering encouragement to people who reach out to me because the idea of anyone feeling like happiness is out of reach for them so they might as well die destroys my heart one string at a time.

SuicideWatch,fpp7tf5,t3_gedf74,1588797457.0,"Something you have to understand though is the reason people saying dying is cowardly is because it final and there's one outcome. People have always had a deep fear of the unknown. When you kill yourself, that's it. You die. So people who go through with it are not only sure about what they want but also comforted by that sense of control. To go on living is to take the risk that life will be hard and that you might one day suffer again. There are too many outcomes to living. 

If life is a box of chocolates then death is a coke. 

You never know whats going to happen to you tomorrow or the next day or ten years from now. The hopelessness shows you only the negative outcomes, like a box of orange creme chocolates ( listen no shade) 

But death is coke. You open the bottle and hey surprise surprise it tastes like coke, looks like coke, must be coke. 


The way I see it, staying alive is hope. Theres are paths that can lead you down roads to happiness but those paths can seem daunting or impossible to get through like a journey in a fantasy novel. When you finally go through with dying its because all hope is lost and you'd rather choose the path where you know the destination.

Its doesn't get better, you MAKE IT BETTER. I was in the same boat too, and im chronically unlucky. For example, I got a really great tax return this year and a promotion and a month later my car broke down. I had to spend my whole tax return and all the extra money from my new job every month to pay for this car so I'm financially back to paycheck to paycheck. But my parents said something really interesting to me, they said wow its so lucky that your car didn't break down until AFTER your tax return and new job. 

See the real issue for us depressed people is that we view the world through a distorted lense. We see the negative where other see a positive. After my attempt, i spent a week in a hospital.  What I learned there was that with proper medication, motivation, and the right tools you can literally require your brain to see more positive in the stressful events of your life. I dont see a lack of ability from you, much like me, I see a lack of proper motivation. 

I always wanted to just be happy or to die because no matter how hard u tried i was sad. The key was that I was trying hard but I was doing it incorrectly. People like you and me can't tackle our problems the ways others do because our depression saps our emotions and energy. And yes its a constant uphill battle for people like us to achieve any sense of happiness. But it really is possible for anyone dude. The reason it doesn't get better for some people is because they didn't have the blessing I had where I achieved motivation ( my roommate was the one to call 911 and hold me barly conscious and THAT shit hurt me and woke me right up. There's nothing quite like seeing someone you love laugh hysterically and beg you to stay)  and I had the blessing to be in the hospital fof a week amongst endless support and helpful information.

I find more often than not that people do care but they just don't know what to say or do, no everyone is equipped to deal with trauma, although I wish you had more support when you posted that. 


I have been in a similar boat before. I always make friends with taker because I am a giver and without that codependency I felt they would  leave and i would have no friends. Eventually they took top much and I had nothing left. It destroyed me and I attempted to take my own life. When I got out of the hospital, some of my friends blocked me, or took my other friends away from me, left me, or even took it upon themselves to tell other about my situation without regard to my feelings. 

The trick is, you have value just for being alive and the value of a human life is priceless. Its just a fact. You can buy anything in the world with money but you can't bring someone back from the dead . Its not a measure of your worth but a measure of their ability to care. What you need to do is find people who don't measure your worth by how whole you are but by the fact that you're a human because that's what procelss things deserve.

SuicideWatch,fpp3c9v,t3_gei9gu,1588795231.0,"Something interesting I realized after my attempt, no one wants to die. Not truly. What we want to to stop experiencing the overwhelming amount of pain, sadness, and general apathy we experience on the daily. It hard to be so sad or apathetic in a world full of people who always seem to be happy. 


The possibility of death as that release was a way out, something you could control and follow though with if you chose too. Dealing with mental illness, usually we cling to anything that gives us control, like cutting or eating disorders, and when that stopped working we seek out death. 


Its completely normal that your feeling even more desperate for death but perhaps, even though its hard, you won't want to, and you definitely won't feel like it, find things to do that you can control. Take up a creative outlet,  get some plants that won't die, damn make a sims version of you!!! 

Finding a healthy way to get some semblance of control over your life helps you create a foundation for pulling yourself out of the dark hole you're in. The number on thing I find amongst my depressed friends that keeps them depressed is the hopelessness. I used to allow myself to stop trying because I didn't think it would work or even matter.

 After i got out of the hospital I promised myself that no matter how horribly I didnt wnat to, I would drag myself to church every Sunday, dressed and showered or not. Then eventually I made a friend and I started investing a little bit more. Then it lead to a youth group whichever to a bunch more friends. That lead to a system that supported me and I was able to start reading and then eventually painting and now I'm back to cooking. Its a slow and uncomfortable and exhausting process. But it all began with a choice to control one thing, going to church on Sunday.

SuicideWatch,fpp26qb,t3_gejdzn,1588794660.0,"The idea of everything ""getting better"" is a fallacy. I was in the hospital for attempted suicide because i had the same mentality as you but you know what i realized? That phrase is bullshit. The world can be beautiful but it can also be harsh and unforgiving. The world doesn't ""get better"" and depression doesn't go away. But the neat thing is, how we view the world, interact with the world, and react to the world is completely in our control.

In order to move forward you need to find away to shift your thinking, plenty of frustrating and hard things have happened to me since I got out of the hospital. But I realized that's not going to change every. Bad things don't just stop happening. I thought about it for a while and then I had another realization, how I react to something is on me. I can sit there and dwell and worry or I can brush it off and choose to rise above the challenges and find a better alternative. The more I started focusing only on what I could control the easier it became to ignore the bad thoughts and focus on the good. The more I did this the more I  began to enjoy new activities, smile, and even change my desires to something attainable. 

Please, before you decide to stop living, just give this a try. Its not easy and it takes a while and you'll still have some really dark days but, if you can even just keep doing this until you have one good day, you'll find yourself motivated to keep going for one more and then another and then before you know it you're back to making plans for the future.

The other thought I have is, maybe right now what you need is to work on you. I still stand by the above advice but  still.

I do think if your wife is willing to try to further discipline her instead of her moving out when you suggest the option you should give it another shot or get her into therapy. Actually scratch that, talk to your wife about getting family therapy with the three of you. Say if she's having trouble adjusting maybe they could use some help. Make sure you communicate the concern being primarily for Ruby though and your wife seems to be clearly focused on her needs rn. If you make it about the other kids then your wife might see it as an attack on Ruby. You can also request to talk to the therapist initially before the session to address some of your concerns to make sure Ruby isn't trying to lie."

Steine- listen I know we associate him with goosebumps and although occasionally gruesome was fairly lighthearted but his Fear Street series is actually really well written and pretty dark honestly. I would say that, more or less, you could get a good result from most any of the books. There is usually at least one murder if not more. Plenty of nut bags in those books."

AmItheAsshole,fgl1d43,t3_eyxg6p,1580879006.0,"NTA. I am a Christian and one of the most crucial and repeated themes the bible teaches is to be kind, compassionate, and to love everyone. If your son, being gay, chooses to engage in a relationship with a guy then that's what he chooses. God gave us free will for a reason. They do not have a to agree with his choice. But they absolutely must be kind to him. Sounds to me like your wife's family needs to go back to bible school and learn that living like christ is more than not sinning, its about how you treat people, and if they cannot seem to grap that well then I feel sorry for them and i will pray for them to receive some guidance and some love in their hearts. 

Tell your son God loves him and so do his people üíó he can come over to MY house with his boyfriend next superbowl (assuming I like football this time next yearüòÇ)"

books,fgk6fk2,t1_fgk4xnx,1580858482.0,Ok I have three books for you. One is risky but I want everyone to read it because its excellent. It is called And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. It starts slow ( you know how ye old character introduction goes) but then it starts to realllly pick up once everyone arrives on the island and the twist is so crazy good. The second is called Language of Flowers. Its heavy in realism but so so so good. The ending is very realistic but yet also uplifting. You somehow know that she will be ok. The third is called the Kingdom of Kevin Malone. It's a light fantasy novel. It's a bit more middle school but I remember enjoying it immensely and loving the main character by the end of the book!
books,fgk4mqo,t1_fgk4g1c,1580857385.0,Well that depends. What are you genres of  choice and what do you consider a satisfying ending
