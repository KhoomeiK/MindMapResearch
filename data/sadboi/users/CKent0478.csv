StarWars,fpu8s05,t1_fptubyd,1588907163.0,"Well, as a fella in his early 40s and SW is right there for me as well. One of the best things to happen for me is to brain wash, I mean share it with, my daughters. The timing of VII, VII, and XI worked out for them to grow up with. We went to TFA with one dressed a Leai and the other a Boba Fett/Snow White combo (inspired by a cos-player we saw once). Then to TLJ with their Porgs. Sitting there in a theater seeing the title shot across and the crawl start, with the music swelling, surrounded by my kids and wife as we eagerly soaked up a new Star Wars adventure was truly a religious experience for me. I will fully admit that I am behind on Clone Wars, Rebels, and Resistance. They are on my ""to watch list"" and I just haven't had the time to sit and devour them yet. Sadly, in this context, I am still working right now. But even without knowing how they fill in and color the overall story, I still loved the crap out of the sequels as they were  the fun adventure stories they are supposed to be. Thank you for your terrific and insightful assessment of the franchise. It was a pleasure to read."
