Psychosis,fdg3sub,t3_el1u6j,1578378938.0,"I had this delusion, that I died back then and that now I am in Hell or Purgatory or another dimension and that everyone else in the world was replaced by demons, and that I had to kill myself to get out of it.

but that was over 10 years ago now, and although I still struggle, this delusion had much less power and I am much more sure of people's existence. My mom's especially. I reached out to her and we grew closer.

I hope with time you can find more peace with this. For me it did get better."

schizophrenia,exgk6p8,t1_exgi3rr,1566266194.0,"When I was 19, I had a weird event where all my family members were replaced by demon lookalikes. Then demons started attacking me. One day, the demons attacked me so hard that I was more terrified than I had ever been about anything in my life (and I have panic attacks before), and then said ""if God really loved you, he wouldn't have let that happen."" And even though I knew that God lets us go through bad things for his own purposes, I was angry at God and did not rebuke them. That was the biggest mistake of my life. Afterwards, Jesus came to me in a dream and told me that He would no longer accept me. This was devastating, and even if it was not true (i do not know if it it true or not), this was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Now that I did not have the protection of Jesus, so many demonic things happened to me after that, they would talk to me through my computer and they were always with me. I would beg God to take me back with sobbing and tears, but I never felt close to Him again. Angels began telling me that because of my terrible sin, if I did not kill myself, God would kill my family members one by one. I was so afraid, but I never was brave enough to do it. They kept communicating to me about spiritual knowledge, things that were so confusing but I knew it was true. One day, something took control of my body and made me do things. It seemed like it was God at first, and I thought it was, but then I felt the deepest evil and I wasn't sure if it was God or a very powerful demon that was controlling me. At the time tho, the demons told me that it was God and that God was secretly evil. They told me God's name was Nothing, and I had to worship the god who's name was Nothing. I was so terrified. 

many things happened like that... i am 29 now, now on meds and ssi and I do not hear voices right now... but all that spiritual stuff that happened has deeply confused me, and troubles me every day... I think that the spiritually related things that happen are the worst because it messes up your relationship with God, your most important relationship. I love Jesus more than anything. And now I am just confused about what things that happened to me were from God, or demons, or voices.

I think all the things that happened to you is a lot scarier and intense than what happened to me, but I have felt all that weird stuff and it's nice to know that someone else has felt that kind of stuff too. Well, not really nice, since it's so much suffering... but weirdly comforting in a way to know I'm not the only human to go through this."
