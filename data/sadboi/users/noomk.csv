SuicideWatch,fjwjyhu,t3_ff6sn9,1583640025.0,"here's the thing: maybe the ""big things"" like friends and family can't keep you going, but there's always some small things that could be comforting to you in this supremely fucked world.

for example:

\- dogs

\- cookies

\- blankets

\- good music

\- free samples at costco 

\- memes

\- scented candles

\- colorful lights

\- people watching (especially in a big city)

\- coffee/hot chocolate/tea/water

and about the college dropout part specifically, you don't need college unless you want to become an astrophysicist or some shit, if you would rather find a way to make money selling painted rocks you find, you do that shit. much love <3 hope you will end up alright"
