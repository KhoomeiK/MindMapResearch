I have had many patients continue on Herceptin even when their EF (ejection fraction) is less than 55%.  Usually there is a dose reduction of 10-20% and the patient may continue with more frequent cardiac monitoring (Echo every 3-6 months, depending). Herceptin would be discontinued if cardio-oncology doesn’t think it’s safe, like you having other medical conditions or if you have any symptoms and they impact your activities of daily living (any shortness of breath with walking, going up stairs, doing other activities)."

NoStupidQuestions,fg7egnm,t3_exb1bi,1580590527.0,My brother and his friends microwaved dog poop in their high school cafeteria microwaves as a grad prank.  Then the high school banned microwaves for 10 years.  I think you might need a new microwave.

Showerthoughts,feg24kq,t3_eou90f,1579073620.0,One winter night my friend and I were walking home from a party - it was a rager so it was nearing 5am. We saw a man bolt down a driveway wearing all black including black gloves and a black toque. We thought it was a burglary so called 911. Turns out it was just a guy going for his morning run. Ahh the good old uni days!
bipolar,fdmne8t,t3_em44y3,1578556693.0,My doctor asked me the other day when I was having suicidal thoughts if I could think of just 1 thing that would make me pause and think twice about actually killing myself. The answer: my dog. It would absolutely crush her if I just disappeared from her life. Sometimes that is the only thing keeping me going. Pets are the best! Hang in there!

I didn’t have my glasses yet in the recovery room so I couldn’t see a nurse to flag them down.  So I resorted to wailing out loud like a hyena.  I found out after that typically for the surgery I had, they would do a brachial nerve block, but in my case didn’t.  The nerve block would have been appreciated."
