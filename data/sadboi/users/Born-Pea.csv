I don‚Äôt know the reason of why he rejected me, but probably he didn‚Äôt want to repeat all the drama that our break up generated. And trust me, I was a ball of nerves lol.

The thing is, I probably still won‚Äôt let go off him, the other guys who show up in my life just want a hook up, so I always end up thinking about the connection we had. However, I‚Äôm scared he didn‚Äôt feel the deepness of it, or he is afraid of becoming vulnerable. As one of his friends told me, he became a bit more open while being with me, and that can be scary. 

The part that got me was that surly I am hurting myself by loving him. I mean, I learnt how to love my body and became more extroverted after meeting him, but even if these few months I‚Äôve been liking him in a rather healthy way, sometimes I find myself overthinking or in a needy position."

Regarding spirit, it was like I‚Äôve known him even before actually knowing him. We had this instant connection in which we both were vulnerable, which I think was big as he might take years before opening up to someone. I blamed it on both of us being Cap Moons. 

I‚Äôve also thought about growing outside this relationship. I‚Äôve done a great deal of work on myself, and try not to be petty or as explosive as I used to be. However, I just don‚Äôt feel about telling him how I feel. I‚Äôm scared of rejection, or of him distancing himself even more, apart from the fact I don‚Äôt feel appropriate going after guys in relationships.

My point is, it‚Äôs about looking and getting someone who is actually a friend with benefits (I met this guy on Tinder, so we weren‚Äôt friends before). You can‚Äôt expect real dates, but staying over and talking is a great sign, but you won‚Äôt necessarily catch feelings because of that."

Emotion tablets might have been the greatest thing mankind has ever invented. Well, maybe not for psychologists. Now, thinking that people wasted energy on feeling seems stupid, unnecessary. Just swallow some happiness and be your best self.

‚ÄúYou have to start with the right foot‚Äù, said my mom. ‚ÄúGotta take your yearly dose of sadness, you don‚Äôt want to be crying being newlywed‚Äù.

True that. But I wonder how my life would have been any different if meeting him a few decades ago. A time neither of us were born.

Roger stands straight waiting for me, and even if my legs tremble, I can feel the ‚Äúlove pill‚Äù kicking in. My dad shakes his hand, leaving a small tablet behind.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need this‚Äù, says Roger, in the numbest voice I‚Äôve ever heard.

It‚Äôs a completely different situation, in which they most likely are also working from home or having a day off. I‚Äôd say talk to her, assure her she is beautiful but get her to understand you are not in your most relaxed state."
TwoXChromosomes,fmgro5f,t3_fuz2eo,1586056030.0,"I hope so. 19F here. I‚Äôve been uncomfortable with my looks all my life until half an year ago. I feel comfortable in my skin now most days, but sometimes compare myself to prettier girls and wonder what could I do to be prettier, sometimes making myself feel bad. I would love to have a chest big enough to find bras that fit (itty bitty titty club), a bigger butt, a nicer face, better skin, etc. But most days I‚Äôm ok with how I look. Plus, ever since I got pass the awkward puberty years I got to be with every guy I wanted to, so I shouldn‚Äôt feel ugly in that way."
amiugly,fma8jt9,t1_fma7roa,1585886620.0,"Thinking it through, it could be as it might not. I‚Äôm not aware of how explicit the content in playboy is honestly, as I‚Äôve been told it goes from sexy pics to full nudity. 

Anyways, if he were to ‚Äúknow‚Äù the girl, it would be weird af, but if it was from some random girl I guess it‚Äôs fine. But why pay for something you can have for free, and with more variety, online? You might get some extra from the physical magazine, but I feel in this case, it‚Äôs the same as looking it up but with a few more bucks."
amiugly,fm9n5lq,t3_ftrt7r,1585872178.0,"Girl, you are beautiful. And even if you weren‚Äôt, why would your bf be paying for some other girl‚Äôs nudes. I‚Äôm not going to shame watching porn or something, but it‚Äôs quite weird he actually spent money on these pictures. I would speak with him about that, but it has nothing to do with your looks :)"

I prefer you without the purple thingy in your head (sorry, English is not my 1st language), your hair is really nice. Also, I‚Äôm lowkey jealous of your body. I‚Äôve been through both antidepressants and heavy break up, and all I can say is you are strong enough to go through this. Keep being positive and you‚Äôll regain your confidence.

Never really considered my mother was abandoning me or something, so I don‚Äôt think your kid will think of it either. Your child might miss you, but if their daycare is good, nothing bad will happen to them neither physically nor psychologically."

I actually thought you were born male but looked a bit younger. Love how you dress and the hair. Speaking of glasses, I would tell you to look for a frame more similar to the ones you have now than your friend‚Äôs. Squearish glasses would look better on you than round, transparent ones.

TwoXChromosomes,fkjcy6p,t3_fitfwg,1584242381.0,"I totally feel you. Sometimes when you don‚Äôt have any visible hardships people tend to think everything in your life is perfect, while it might be crumbling down. I have faced depression and being medicated because of it since I was 7, despite having a rather good upbringing. Few people know my father was emotionally abusive, or that I felt unsafe at school to the point I would throw up every day just for thinking about going. Depression goes up and down sometimes, but it is something you shouldn‚Äôt have to justify to anyone, specially some prick who has a tupperware for head. 
I‚Äôm almost 20 right now. You said you have math class (instead of calculus or smth) so I assume you are younger. Best you can do is keep being true to yourself. I know what it is to want to die everyday and hating yourself, although I can‚Äôt know how you feel as I don‚Äôt know you. But let me tell you, it all will get better. Find yourself good friends, or at least, cut off people who are bad for you. Find an escape, for me it was spirituality. And hang in there, please. I know some days it all seems dark, but I promise you, you will find your light."

The thing is many people I know don‚Äôt know a doctor can take people around as long as they don‚Äôt bother the patients.

Being around the hospital might be weird with an older adult, but getting in a consultation room with one is a no-no. Just leave them in the corridor for a while."

I still knew I liked him but didn‚Äôt need to check on him constantly. Used that time to make myself feel better and prepare for college, but yesterday I got to know about this through a friend (although I suspected it) and just broke down. 
I know I deserve to be someone‚Äôs first choice, or rather the only one, but I keep choosing him every day, maybe because I just don‚Äôt have the willpower to tell myself that even if what I feel is true, it doesn‚Äôt go both ways. I think the fact that she is younger is what really got me, and don‚Äôt know how to feel."
depression,fji4kwz,t1_fji1ts3,1583360500.0,"We were together for a short period of time. He wasn‚Äôt over his ex, they ended up lasting 3 more months. I tried moving on but felt a strong connection. We see each other regularly in college and will share a class this semester (classes have something like 25 students each). I opened up in November and he rejected me. Since then I have been trying to really better myself and we got along better. However, I got to know yesterday he is dating a girl who is like 6 years younger (creepy af as she‚Äôs barely starting high school). She got this grown up body, and kind of makes me feel insecure of my rather childish shape (short, skinny and with almost no attributes)."

Many people has been fighting for this right for years, women have been struggling about this topic, and most importantly, dying. However, I feel it‚Äôs quite weird  to say ‚Äúmajor‚Äù, maybe to say ‚Äúfirst‚Äù, because Uruguay has legal abortions since 2012, although we are just 3 million. Yes, Argentina is a big country and many more women will be benefited from this than in Uruguay, but this right was also fought for over here. I feel the headline is for surprise factor, but it‚Äôs quite deceiving. Anyways, stay strong Argentinians. Ser√° legal! üíö"
