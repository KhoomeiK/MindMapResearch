servicedogs,fo3ji5t,t3_g5bxwc,1587487943.0,"I have maybe a unorthodox approach to this.

The way I react to people trying to pet her is I ignore them and say ""ah ah I didn't say!"" To Quinn and she will return her attention to me.  The person will say ""it's ok!"" And I say ""no it isn't, she needs to pay attention to me unless I tell her she can say hi.  Not now Quinn""  and if the person persists I say to the person in a stern loud tone ""no, not now.  We're busy""  ""I'm trying to eat / I'm in the middle of a conversation / paying for my food / need to check out"" or whatever.  I believe this calls attention to the disrespectful interruption they made. 

 If they ask nicely and I don't mind and it isn't inconvenient to stop and talk, I say ""Quinn"" and wait for eye contact, ""would you. like. to.  Say. Hi?"" And make her wait she looks at me and I say ""ok.  You can say hi!"" In the tone I use for encouragement, and when it has been enough I say ""ok.  All done.  All done saying hi."" And if they don't stop ""Qui-inn...enough.  Pay attention to me.""  And usually the person will stop and say thank you.  If it is kids I also say ""Quinn.  Be.  Gentle.  He's little.""  ""That's very nice being sweet to the kids"".

I use this to reinforce Quinn and I think it demonstrates to people that I am in charge without being confrontational.  My trainer probably thinks I should be more assertive in educating people but I find that to be taxing and negative.  I like to channel a positive interaction and I think the people still get to observe the right way to interact and it is good for Quinn.  

One interesting thing for us, is Quinn will go up to someone who has lost a pet or loved one recently and want to comfort them. That is her trained task so I tell her ""she's ok, she is just sad because she just misses her dog""  or ""she's sad because her husband died a long time ago and he was sick and it still hurts""  because usually the person is ooening up about whatever.  I'm one of the people that for some reason people share with.  In my non-expert opinion, that is a positive thing for Quinn to not have confusing discouragement...it is a reinforced behavior that I shaped for me, and I am not sure dogs have the nuanced intellect to understand that complexity of ignore other sad people but comfort me.  It may have to do with Quinn's personality.  She still takes her cues from me, but I can tell the person is sad based on Quinn approaching them (and by approach, I just mean she looks at them and puts her nose toward them, she doesn't pull away from me, and she pays attention to me in parallel the whole time).

Quinn has very good self control and she understands a lot ftom my tone and the words I say, she is pretty fluent in English.  Not all service dogs would do well with the strategy we use.  I also kind of made it up as we went, it isn't something anybody would deliberately teach.  I am not saying this will work for you, but I hope it gives you some optimistic feelings about how negatives can be turned around and give you some creative openness about ways to handle interactions besides getting annoyed all the time.  Attitude is important.  I have a lot of patience, people in my life often ask if I get sick of the attention and usually I say ""It took some getting used to but I got used to it by now.""

I also sometimes babble to interested people about how I trained her myself and not all service dog handlers want to be approached but personally I enjoy positive experiences.  A lot of people know a disabled person in their life and are curious how a dog could help, how to obtain one, I just talk about the basic pros and cons and laws and options I am not a professional source of advice and I tell people it's my own experience that I have learned from and I hope it helps.

This is not a good approach for everyone.  But it is consistently successful for us.

Also, there is something about nonverbal cues and assertive energy that seems to ward off bad behavior from passersby.  I would say that in my experience, we have hardly as much negative interactions as I hear about in this community.  We are confident in going about our business and I have gotten good at multitasking to manage her in general and also pretty good at parallel interactions with people, so for me it isn't too hard.

However...we were badly verbally abused once and I was traumatized for a few days.  I handled it calmly but inside I was boiling and terrified.  It happens to all of us."

Epilepsy,ffpf9ee,t3_eu9487,1580093589.0,Yes.  I turned out to have psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.  I am very prone to psychiatric side effects and I have PTSD.  As we tried different AEDs I had to keep increasing my dose of Latuda.  Fycompa was horrible my poor boss was worried about my amnesia but once I got off the Fycompa things got better.  I still take Latuda and I need a long stable period before I try to reduce it.  I recommend you find a psychiatrist if you need help managing those kinds of side effects.
ptsd,ffpe77q,t3_eufgos,1580092828.0,"Are you still triggered?  Breathe in for a slow count of 3 or 4, whatever feels comfortable, hold in for 2, breathe out 3 or 4 and turn right around breathe in.  Some people like to hold the breath empty too (like, pause before you inhale too).  This can slow your heart rate and slow your racing thoughts.  I also recommend changing your surroundings even if just trying a different desk in the same room.  Try watching youtube videos of music or cute animals.  Maybe watch ""walk me home"" by P!nk.  That song really speaks to me and the video is mesmerizing.  Try herbal tea.  Eat snacks.  If you are not eating enough you can be stressed from low blood sugar which makes it hard to sleep and hurts your appetite even more.

Do you want to tell me what you are triggered about?  I can't promise to stay up much later but I will check in the morning."

ptsd,ffpa93w,t3_eu4zi2,1580090045.0,"Prazosin made me too faint I have not needed it as much lately but I swear by Latuda.  You take it every day as directed, it helps me with flashbacks and ""daymares"" too.  I do sometimes feel sad about being on antipsychotic medication for years but hey, I'm happy.  However, drugs still need therapy.  Pills cannot make your nightmares go away for good, they just help you get better rest to function.  I think of it as needing pharmaceutical help to keep me functioning well enough to live on my own and do therapy while working."
ptsd,ffp9n79,t3_eufz60,1580089618.0,"Nighttime is hard for me too.  I suck at crying.  I have medication, a therapist, and a service dog so I am doing the best I ever have been but nights can still be hard.  Yes, there are success stories.  My most helpful exercise my therapist gave me was to journal little entries of what I am doing when I notice that I feel happy.  If you never feel happy, there will still be times you feel less than your maximum misery.  Try writing down the date and time and activity every time you notice any relative relief from your suffering.  You can notice patterns and prove to yourself that there are good times each day where things feel less bad than they do at night."

I literally just, an hour ago, finished reporting sexual harassment to HR that happened to me 2 years ago because my current supervisor cared enough about me that I felt safe to tell him.

servicedogs,ffbygyw,t3_d0y3qz,1579786775.0,"The individual dog matters more than the breed.  My trainer places adults 1-3 years old so she can assess their temperament.  My girl is a stray Pyrenees and she is amazing.  Washout has a lot to do with not following through on enrichment and ongoing lifelong training and reinforcing everything the dog knows.  Not all purebred puppies with still be the right temperament when they grow up.  You can train a puppy but you cannot mold a desired personality.  If you choose a pure bred, know that not all pure breds are good and just the same, not all rescues are good.  Choosing the right individual dog is very critical and I recommend you consult a trainer to help you pick a dog no matter which way you decide."
servicedogs,ffbxca0,t3_d4drjl,1579785812.0,"Everyone here covered it all...except...tell an Uber driver they are required in their contract to follow federal law to transport your service animal and if they refuse you will report them.  If they refuse, cancel the ride before they do.  Then report them.  Uber will contact you within half an hour in my experience.  They will ask for lots of details to document the interaction then they will fire the driver for good.  I have only been refused twice or so.  I have had some drivers be concerned about her size, hair, wet paws, maybe fearful, but I tell them she is gentle and she will lay down once the car is moving and I put a towel over the seats to keep the car clean.  I once had someone very fearful who did take us and I was impressed because it really was difficult for her but she did take us and was respectful and did not complain other than asking me to keep her laying down in the backseat.  I also have had drivers need me to get her to lay down so they can see around her because she is big.  As a service dog handler you are required to keep the ride safe and keep the car in the same condition it was when it arrived to get you.  Generally I have had uneventful Uber experiences.  I never drive don't even own a car, so I have lots of experience to speak from."
servicedogs,ffbw96n,t1_ffbhh9u,1579784850.0,If you continue enriching her life with reewards and training even just games for fun...she won't wash out.  Dogs need to be motivated to work.  My trainer has turned down just one client because she had a strong sense they were not going to participate in the training enough and the dog was surely going to wash out.  Sad because the client was a caretaker of someone with Downs and they expected to just be handed a dog that would take care of the person for her.  My trainer has a background in hospice so it must have been bad for her to walk away.
servicedogs,ffbugpv,t3_d808am,1579783152.0,"I am very similar to you in my disability, PTSD with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.  My dog is a stray rescue mix that I trained myself with a professional.  She looks for adult dogs 1-3 years old and fosters them for a month then Quinn lived with me for a month to assess her temperament.  She is a Pyrenees which is not something you would usually see as a service dog they are usually a livestock guard dog not herding just guarding.  My trainer really likes that breed, Quinn is her second Pyrenees.  My trainer disagrees with starting with a puppy because even a pure bred lab or poodle or golden or shepherd may grow up to have an impossible temperament.  People may disagree with me but my trainer is a professional and I had great success with Quinn who was picked out specifically for me and what I need.  I am not saying that any dog at all can be a service dog.  What I want you to understand is that the individual dog matters more than the breed.  Not all labs can be a service dog and some stray mutts make great service dogs.  And you can't mold a puppy's personality it could grow up to be too independent too playful too nervous too agressive even have psychiatric issues.  Owner training is also very cost effective if you train your first dog with a professional who isn't a quack and you can probably get one faster than being on a waitlist with a program."
servicedogs,ffbtvd6,t1_ffb7dcq,1579782553.0,"Yeah...I trained mine too.  I didn't know the part about 4 paws on the ground...except if their task is something like deep pressure grounding where she would stand her front paws on me?  I decided she is too big for that not to be disruptive so she figured out just to keep nudging me and getting me to keep petting her head.  I hate to assume a fake service dog if it may have just made a mistake, but that was inacceptable."

backpain,ff5t0la,t1_ff3p4qt,1579609129.0,Well I saw the surgeon yesterday told him I want to do a steroid injection and time off for PT in the pool...and he said it is reasonable so he referred me to somebody for the injection!  I'm gonna give that a good try and try to hold off on surgery but someday I will do it.  I just don't want to sooner than I have to.  He said that joint actually does not move the way it should it has motion in wrong ways so my concern actually is not a concern!
backpain,ff3ny6a,t3_ereik2,1579545107.0,"I'm 27, fused t6-l5 at age 14, now I have l5-s1 spondylolisthesis with disc gone and chiropractor gave me his blessing for fusing that too.  I have been falling because of the nerve compression.  Friday at work my boss was helping me get onto my feet from a chair we were struggling for an hour before my legs woke up, he was gripping my arm so tight we bruised my arm and my chiropractor had to fix my upper back from that today.

I don't want to have surgery either, I dodged it 4 years ago with a nerve root block and I want to try that again but if we don't think it will work this time...it is deteriorating I don't know what will happen to me if I wait.

My surgery as a kid was for scoliosis and the outcome was miraculous.  I did not even know how much pain I was in before surgery.  I hesitate to do it again because the joint in question is critical I would lose range of motion and I am very worried about that.

But.. my point to you is, if this is your first surgery...mine lasted 13 years of relief...you would be almost 40 even if you had more problems the same time I did relative to my first surgery.  I know surgery is tough but you could benefit so much.  Please be brave and open minded and get lots of alternate opinions.  Not only is there the question if...but also how.  Different surgeons have different approaches.  Also...consider pre-op PT to get stronger and recover faster...and you might not end up needing surgery as a result.

Good luck."

My therapist told me she respected me everytime I resisted her pushing and now that I am ready to tackle my past she is really happy.  She still knows I can't be pushed.
