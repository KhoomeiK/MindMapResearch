UFV,fqzi23u,t3_gla8p3,1589767832.0,"So let me get this straight, you expect teachers to be more available but think students should choose when their classes are? Perhaps this format works for you, but for many people (myself included) the structure from designated class times is what we need.

Do I think PowerPoint slides should be available after class? Yes. Do I think lectures and notes should be? No. Students should face the same repercussions in this format that they did if they missed an in person class; get completed notes from another student, or hope that the professor gives you notes if you offer a legitimate reason for missing class. Being able to be in your PJs drinking a coffee comfortably at your computer is more relaxing than going to class, so take what you can get. Having an actual structured lecture allows students to ask questions as they go. Furthermore, actually taking notes aids in information retention.

Assignments should stay the same. No more, no less. Professors need to assign tests and assignments as an assessment tool to determine if a student is struggling and needs help before they tank their exam. Assignments should be an opportunity for students to collaborate, not exams. That being said, I do think assignments should be worth more, tests should be worth less, and class participation should be considered when determining final grade. 

Your suggestion about tests may be the stupidest thing I've read on this subreddit ever.  Giving more time and less restrictions is encouraging collaboration and cheating which completely goes against UFVs cheating and plagarism policy. I think a good compromise would be to give more time (maybe 3 hours instead of 2), have multiple versions of the exam, and allow students to choose when they take the exam. I've had professors do this on Blackboard with fantastic results. For example, the exam is available from 9am to 9pm, but as soon as you hit 'start' you have 90 minutes to complete it. That way it's a decent middle ground. The structure is there and reducing the likelihood of cheating, but the student can pick a time that works best for them. Exams help prepare students for deadlines and crunches in their post-secondary career.

All of the things you propose do not foster a positive learning environment. It may seem that way in the short term, but it's important to retain the framework that's in place for when classes do back to in person delivery. If how things are don't work for you maybe institutions like UFV aren't suited to your learning style. There are schools like Quest (in Squamish) that focus more on collaboration and less on structure and exams.

One thing I do agree with you on is the cost of tuition and fees. These should be changed to reflect services and we are unable to access."

CoronavirusCanada,fo7ougl,t1_fo74ih5,1587581993.0,"I do see where you're coming from, and you do make some fair points. **However** the Student Summer Job incentives only reward companies for hiring students under the age of 30, so that means people like myself (32) who waited to go to post secondary school fall through the cracks.

Additionally, scholarships are not an option for many students, especially students at smaller institutions. As a cis, heterosexual, white, childless woman with a GPA *just* below 3.0, most scholarships don't apply to me. I do think the scholarships are there for people who deserve it most, but they aren't as wide reaching as you think. And speaking of grants, bursaries, and the provincial government funds available (and I can only speak for BC), I looked into it, my university's max bursary is $1000 for 4 months, and the BC government's meager support package for students only allows a one-time maximum payment of $1000.

Yes, there are plenty of students who don't work during the summer, but that's not the point. Many students take classes in the summer, and without classes available, students cannot apply for student loans. Student loans are a vital resource to help us survive, so without them and without a healthy job market, that leaves a lot of students up shit creek without a paddle. That being said, I do agree with you; a lot of these is based on the honor system, and it's up to all of us to not be buttholes about it."

- find one that suits your vibe. Like outdoor photos? Find someone who excels in those. Like indoor moody snaps? Ditto. My fiance and I are getting married on a beach, and we picked a photographer who also specializes in nature photography. The guy doesn't fuck around. He's checking sunrise/sunset times, tide tables, the whole shebang.

- next, look at editing. Do you prefer your photos as unedited as possible? Don't opt for someone who has a tendancy to overprocess. However, if you like photogs who add cool effects, or are good at disguising flaws, go for someone with A+ editing skills

- talk to them! My fiance and I emailed back and forth with photographera for a while before we decided on one. It's important to get a feel for the kind of person they are.

But yeah, totally! I probably put in 25 to 30 hours to wear it like, 6."

I considered the sewing thing but figured it would be too time consuming. That being said, all of the cards (except for the breastplate and greaves) are layered like scales with only the top 1/5 of the card glued to the surface. That gave the garment a lot of flex in those areas. My only real issue was the greaves; those had to be glued down firmly so they wound up being very rigid."
