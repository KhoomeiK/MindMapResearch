&#x200B;

First and foremost I got anxiety that I never had before a few weeks before I quit.  That was the nail in the coffin for quitting.  I was on librium for five days after I quit.  About a week later the anxiety came back for about two weeks.  It was hell.  A lot of it having to do with health... but I got a physical and blood panel and I was good.  Everything was good.  That laid that to rest.  Then it came back a week later, weird aches and pains I never had before.  But I had already started back my jogging routine at this point.  Also in pretty good shape anyway and I still took care of myself drinking.  I have weird aches and pains on my right rib, more superficial than internal.  I had some aches under my armpits on my rib.  Right inner hip has been sore.  Maybe I'm just getting old?  I'm 35.  So between those things I thought the worst and maybe thought I had a lymph node issue... lymph nodes are fine.  Just PAWS and muscle strain.  I had a muscle knot on my right lat below my armpit that I rubbed out and has since shrunk to almost nothing.  


Other than that I feel great.  


I've always slept great. But sleeping better now.  That hangover ""energy"" (numb to grogginess but still kinda sleepy) is gone, so I can actually feel groggy sometimes if I undersleep or oversleep.  


I'm more in tune with eating better than I did before.  Doing candida diet right now, it feels great.  I've lost 30 pounds since February 11th.

&#x200B;

I physically and emotionally feel great.  I still have bouts of anxiety but I feel like its more correlated with PAWS than anything.  I don't identify with anything like that so hopefully it's temporary.    


Watch the 0% beer.  If you're going to do that I recommend the faux beers you can get at a Total Wine - basically carbonated malt/hop juice.  There are some good ones out there.  I found a Raspberry NA gose... pissed me off when I saw the carb count.

From what I've read on several sites, it can be change in diet, something we ate, medication, fungus/bacteria/parasites, or the scary stuff - but a few sites I've read basically state it's really up to you to be in tune with your own body and the internet is not a safe place to self-diagnose if you're seeing a bunch of ""bad"" results.  The anxiety can make it worse, but I'm sure you knew that already.  Anxiety can do all kinds of things.

Anyhow...

Not just any CBD will help... full spectrum helps me better than broad spectrum, and some folks may experience vice versa.  But it's also snake oil and its effects may not be beneficial, and can even exacerbate some issues if the body doesn't respond well.  Personally it's hit or miss and sometimes won't respond if your anxiety isn't caused by a latent chemical imbalance.  

CBD will not provide relief like smoking a joint or taking something like xanax.  Try taking lemon balm or l-theanine, or any relaxing tea (stuff with lavender and chamomile) if you actually want to feel a semblance of natural relaxation.  And it's cheaper.  


If it's chronic, what's helped me is ashwaghanda in the morning, l-theanine in the afternoon, and 5HTP at night.  But when I was taking these early in drying out from alcohol, I really couldn't tell a difference after quitting them trying to weed out other what I know now to be candida symptoms.

And in my story, if it's not candida.... welp, I have no clue because I'm otherwise healthy as a horse and I don't got any ailments or diseases."
Candida,fpf0062,t1_fpeyizw,1588558650.0,"Sorry, didn't mean to repeat that. Read some stuff about antifungals causing it, too. Could be dieoff from the supplements.

All I can say after going 30 minutes ago, second time in several hours, I feel a whole lot better. For now.  This is all so strange."
Candida,fpew9de,t1_fpeuore,1588556312.0,What about floaty black specks???  Never had 'em before.
Candida,fpep7yh,t1_fpeotx5,1588552012.0,"One of my supplements has caprylic acid in it.

Stools stopped ""forming"" today.  But I've also started with coconut oil two days ago too.  Along with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in some green tea.  

Is it normal for the stomach to be all gurgly starting all this?  I started the diet two days ago.  I can say cramps/side aches have decreased but now gastrointestinal stuff is happening."
Candida,fpen6cw,t1_fpem3lf,1588550794.0,"Interesting.  Question, perfect health other than some stuff that's discussed on this forum (weird aches and pains, mostly \*on\* rib, scalp seborreic dermatis, bouts of extreme dread anxiety I've never had).  I've had some on-off die-off symptoms since I quit drinking  February 11th and didn't know it until a few days ago when I started reading about this.  I changed my diet already, but cut all sugar a few days ago with new supplement regiment (Candicid, has all the herbs you guys recommend) plus Candex, which helps digest yeast.  Also normally take a probiotic or two a day.  Diet is the high protein and little sugar stuff, staying away from carbs, etc.  Mostly eggs with coconut oil, quinoa, chicken, lemon water, and avocado.

I felt like I had diarrhea yesterday but it ""went away"".  Also gotta point out I take an ER iron supplement three days a week and always turns my poo darker - like clockwork.  But today, had hefty diarrhea, and noticed some larger-than-quinoa black pearl-like things.  Should I be worried?  Hasn't happened before.

I've also been taking milk thistle every night before bed.  Liver is also good when I had a physical, as were other parts of my blood panel and deficiency panel."

I even wrote a story of how she reminded me of a few people I used to know.  Not very nice.  Ha.

I hope she's real though, at the very least."

Candida,fpazx2x,t1_fpaskp5,1588459199.0,"Funny enough I was prescribed effexor and it came in the mail last week during ""good"" days.  I'm a bit hesitant to start taking it.  Not sure what answers I'd get about the aches on my ribs. It's the damn anxiety keeping me away from the doc again - what if it's something else?  And the circle goes on.  I'm fine right now but on evenings it hits me, it takes a day to recover if I'm going to have a set of ""good"" days."
Candida,fparviz,t1_fparap4,1588454416.0,"Interesting.  Background is military, 13 years of it.  Been through quite a bit previously as well.  I handled quitting drinking pretty well.  

With your scalp tingles, does it feel like seborrheic dermatitis?  Sometimes mine just burns slightly, and most of the top of my scalp is very sensitive, moreso than it used to be.  I'm also balding (hence the shaving) and most of the sensations are around the crown.

Sorry to keep bothering with this."
Candida,fpaqsco,t1_fpap3sl,1588453770.0,"Damn man.

The anxiety gets me stuck in a few hours of circular in-my-head shit man.  It's horrible.  It feels horrible.  It ruins shit and I KNOW there's nothing wrong with me.  But what makes it worse, I tend to doubt that, and then that spirals me into shit-myself mode as a state of being rather than a moment.  It's stupid.

I drank socially and sometimes drank heavily since I was 21, but really in moderation.  It was only the last three years or so that I was a lot heavier.  PAWS is possible even without being a life-long drinker?  Because the anxiety hit right before I quit, which is what caused me to quit, but all these symptoms didn't appear until after I quit... and ergo part of the anxiety is what if there was an underlying issue with my drinking was causing all this shit... you know?  Seems too much of a perfect storm.

I'm gonna do this candida diet thing for a few weeks and if my symptoms don't go away I'll go to my doctor.  If I had something terrible I should be feeling it  - like a fever and fatigue or something, and I don't, just my listed symptoms."
