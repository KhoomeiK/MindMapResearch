But you'd have to first recondition a male-designed, -driven, and -led society that women are not biologically inferior AND that the biological differences actually compliment each other. That goes against the incessant need for the superiority/domination complex tho. 

Then you'd have to go deeper and undo the conditioning from birth that tells girls and the world they are frail and weak and always will be (to the point doctors said women shouldn't *run* because their uteruses would fall out), and then reinforcing this by putting little girls in dresses and fancy shoes and forcing them to sit and be pretty so they ruin that pretty lil outfit while the boys get to horseplay and climb trees and skateboard and come back covered in mud and bruises, not encouraging girls to engage in fitness and making all bodywork programs designed around strengthening male bodies while directing women to merely ""Keep the weight off so you can get a husband/so your husband doesn't cheat, fattie"", which interestingly involves dangerously low caloric intake which will prevent any kind of strength or fitness, along with distracting girls with incessant catering to male approval via hours spent on hair, makeup, fashion aka physical appearance instead, followed by ironically convincing females that lifting turns you into Schwarzenegger in a week and this would be a very bad thing because *ewww women with muscles look gross* which is another great way to ensure they have no strength because they don't even know that, like every other area of their lives, they'll have to put in twice the work to get half the results.

Female bodies are not celebrated for what they can do, only how they serve. Until that attitude changes, the mindset will continue to infect every aspect of life and society in which teamwork makes the dream work.

Good luck with all that."
