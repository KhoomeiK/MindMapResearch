actuallesbians,fq8ec10,t1_fq8ar8g,1589164281.0,"Thank you, this is very helpful information! Edit: also where can I exclusively meet queer friends? I have some already from back home, but I recently moved to a new city so I don't really know how to do that in a new place if that makes sense? Like in a way where it's not super inorganic?"
raisedbynarcissists,fjxniva,t1_fjxgtt4,1583678743.0,"Okay, that second paragraph...I didn't know that all of my feelings could be put into words so well. 

""I don't like people knowing me or being too familiar with me at all"" - omg ME TOO. Not sure if it's exactly the same in your case, but I feel like I get \*less\* comfortable around people the more I get to know them. So when I get into a relationship, I start out being pretty outgoing, and then over time I revert back into my shell where I feel too shy to talk to or be around my partner. It's really bizarre."
sex,f9p73bn,t1_f9p52bz,1575523798.0,"Yeah, for sure. Either way he's definitely a huge fuckboy. I think the thing that weirded me out the most was that he lead me on for literal months. I've definitely been played by fuckboys before but this one was really something else - they generally don't make more than a couple weeks of effort in my experience. Just really strange to me that someone would be cool with that level of manipulation for so long."
sex,f9p6hr9,t1_f9p3c32,1575523237.0,Can you read at all? None of it was difficult to comprehend. This is hopeless.
sex,f9p349l,t1_f9p2m39,1575520305.0,"Ah, I see. Yeah, I would also like to know what he was thinking."
sex,f9p2yjh,t1_f9p2qae,1575520177.0,"Your logic here is, ""Stop whining because I had it worse than you.""

Also a ""few weeks,"" wtf? I said right in my post that we talked non-stop for four months and he was very enthusiastic about meeting me."
sex,f9p2f1s,t1_f9p1uug,1575519747.0,"My therapist has worked with a ton of sociopaths and psychopaths in mental hospitals, so I trust her judgment on this kind of thing. I don't think she used the word ""undoubtedly,"" but I still think she's right, and I gave her more details than I gave here.

The rest of your comment makes me believe that you've never had any sort of relationship with a manipulative person before if you think it's that simple. Did you read what I wrote about him being a bit too aggressive during sex? What if I had refused him and he just kept doing it anyway, like I mentioned in my post?"
sex,f9p25ph,t1_f9p21ic,1575519538.0,Because you don't believe what I'm saying? Or you think I'm exaggerating?
bipolar,evobxq2,t1_evoavqn,1564643053.0,"Firstly, congrats on not purging in years! That's a big accomplishment!

And you're so right about the childhood trauma thing - I was very much abused by my dad growing up and I think the need for control using food (and OCD for that matter) stemmed from that. That, and he abused my mom financially and so she raised us with the notion that there was never enough money to go around (there was) so everytime we got a meal we were to eat absolutely EVERYTHING on the plate, no exceptions.

There are a lot of abuse layers there, as you can see lol"
bipolar,evobaz9,t1_evo7uup,1564642642.0,"My therapist and I very recently started talking about this so we haven't had much time to discuss many solutions, but he told me I need to continuously have something I'm working toward in life, because when I get bored-depressed, that's when the bingeing acts up again"
bipolar,evnyzc0,t1_evnybag,1564635092.0,Totally makes sense. It's so weird because when I was in college I was orthorexic and counted EVERY calorie while obsessively working out and then over the past few years it's totally shifted to just plain old binge-eating.
flexibility,evkwfr8,t1_evjxyb0,1564587360.0,"That's helpful, thanks! I've been stretching upper back almost every day (only muscle group I work on that frequently) because that is the area that needs the most work... should I quit doing that and space it out more?"
flexibility,eviy47s,t1_evixvda,1564551738.0,"No, wtf are you talking about my dude"
flexibility,evixng1,t1_eviwzq1,1564551461.0,What? I'm genuinely confused by this question. I do want their advice.

bipolar,ev8bqka,t1_ev5elkv,1564274877.0,"Can you tell me more about acid/shrooms? I've never done them and tbh the only time I've ever hallucinated was not a particularly fun experience (too much weed). They aren't super addictive, right?"
bipolar,ev49l4e,t1_ev48z2x,1564210125.0,HELL YEAH DAWG
bipolar,ev43z1h,t1_ev42c1t,1564207197.0,"Makes sense, and you're probably right! I'm just hoping I can find a social circle in my new city of people who don't do copious amounts of drugs..."
bipolar,ev40e7u,t1_ev3z5tx,1564205545.0,"Totally gotcha on that. My thing is like, I've never had a super hard time staying away from alcohol or other ""minor"" substances - I've developed a pretty good system for managing my disorder so I don't want to fuck it up. I do binge drink sometimes, but only on the weekends - so, assuming  I was to only do coke occasionally during weekend parties or something, would it still be super problematic?"
sex,eursnv5,t1_eurm96p,1563998415.0,"That's fair, he seems like a pretty professional person so I definitely wouldn't ask him until after PT is over. He's also not an actual licensed PT yet...still doing rotations. I don't know if that makes a difference at all, or if that even means the disciplinary action would be more harsh."
sex,eufn7t9,t1_eufmylr,1563781793.0,"Fair! Sorry to keep dragging this on, but I feel like it is so different between guys and ladies...like, if the roles were swapped, many women would probably be pretty caught off guard by something like that I'd think. 

Are guys kind of generally dtf if it's kind of out of the blue and it's a reasonably attractive person proposing it?"
sex,eufmtoe,t1_eufmls6,1563781260.0,That seems reasonable. I am always terrified of rejection though haha. I have most definitely been rejected before.
sex,euflxa4,t1_euflvdi,1563780060.0,"I'm a fairly attractive person, yeah. I've had people tell me I'm probably an 8. I've modeled some. Idk if that helps."
sex,eufjhhz,t1_eufjeul,1563776952.0,"Oh fuck, please tell me how to initiate in the best way from your professional perspective??

Also, do PTs ever get actually turned on touching their patients that much?"
relationships,eufiuoc,t3_cg9gp0,1563776181.0,Commenting because I have the exact same thing going on lol
bipolar,eufimhp,t3_cfz55z,1563775906.0,"I have type II and I've definitely had people be like, ""oh you can't be THAT bad"" because I've never been hospitalized or arrested. Like, yo we're not all going around getting arrested all the time...most/many of us can function for the most part and stuff."
dating_advice,et0kmev,t3_c9iuae,1562380868.0,"I'm going to play devil's advocate here. I'm nearly 30 and still single with no real intentions of going out and finding someone. Like, if someone happens to come into my life then cool, but otherwise I'm happy being alone. 

I am a reasonably attractive person and I think people probably also wonder if there are things wrong with me (there are lol but I digress), but at the end of the day I don't really give a shit because I'm pretty content with being alone. And the right person wont care when it come down to it.

TL;DR: ain't nothing wrong with being single at all!"
bipolar,esk2inc,t1_esk0s5j,1562049182.0,Thanks for the reply! I think finding a support group is a great idea!
raisedbynarcissists,erditxb,t1_erdgf8h,1560743499.0,That's a good idea!
raisedbynarcissists,ercirjo,t3_c1csi2,1560713277.0,It's definitely gotten easier for me. I've been NC with Ndad for five years now (limited contact with Emom) and the only time it's difficult at this point is during the holidays. At the end of the day what helps me is knowing that my friends care about me and that they're my real family.
TrollXChromosomes,ep3rn8o,t1_ep310mz,1559027526.0,"Honestly sometimes I'll try to just change the subject really fast or kind of ignore it and put on my headphones before I'm REALLY tempted to engage. I'm already poor as is so I really can't afford to lose my job because I snapped at my boss. Ya know?

It also really sucks that none of my Male coworkers ever stand up for me :/"
TrollXChromosomes,ep3r6sm,t1_ep3q32l,1559027325.0,"Dude, go away"
TrollXChromosomes,ep2kuri,t3_btue0s,1559009604.0,"Just to give a little more context, I am the only woman in an all-male office, and I am the only one he does this to. It's like he thinks literally everything I say is wrong and is always ""fact-checking"" me. We also don't have an HR department so there's nothing I can legally do about it. I'm afraid of calling him out because I don't want to get fired...

&#x200B;

And the best part of this is that he calls himself a feminist. LOL"
