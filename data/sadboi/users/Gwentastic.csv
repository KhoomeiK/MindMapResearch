Right now, life is so abnormal that I've kept up that routine just to try to preserve some of that normalcy that's now lacking elsewhere.

AskReddit,fofxoxr,t1_foc8cec,1587744633.0,"Former server. I remember how nice it was when someone would write ""thank you"" on a credit card receipt, so that's what I do now.  If it's not too busy I'll let the manager know that my server was super helpful or friendly or whatever.  Especially at chain restaurants where you know corporate pays a lot of attention to customer comments or sends in secret shoppers.  That one can be hard to gauge though, because you don't want to pull a manager away from what they're doing if it's busy or they're dealing with a customer issue.  So I don't get to do it as much as I'd like.

I remember this one New Year's Eve when I was working at a sort of upscale bar (expensive martinis, mid-priced food).  Was working a double, so I was pretty tired.  It was so crowded that I struggled to get to the order station, so crowded that I occasionally got an elbow or two to the ribs.  We had live music that night, which I always hated because I could never hear customers' orders, which added to the stress.  Nearly cried a couple of times.  Easily one of the hardest shifts I've had.

It's been almost 20 years but I remember that one table had something like a $50 check but tipped me $100.  Like you said, it's humanizing."

I think the ones I have are mostly Dansko Professionals.  They had some fairly basic colors then, but I just checked the website and it looks like they've really expanded the line.  I also had a backless pair in hot pink that I really loved - it was just from the regular collection.  

Clark's also had an offshoot brand called Indigo - had a really cute couple pairs from them - but I don't think they had enough ankle support for me to have worn at work.  They were my ""comfort clogs.""  They're in my closet somewhere and I've worn them in the past couple years. They've also held up well and have some super cute daisies on the upper.

My serious, hardcore clogs are actually from Sweden - looks like the brand is Troentorp.  These guys have wooden soles and are nailed together instead of stitched.  I just pulled them out to check the brand and from the looks of it, they're handmade.  They were my first pair and must have been crazy expensive, especially for a server!  I guess I have an impulsive streak, or at least I did back then.

I hope that helps!

Edited to add - since Indigo might not be around anymore, Clarks probably makes a decent mid-priced clog.  If your job involves standing or walking for long periods, Dansko is a solid choice.  They were my go-to when I was waiting tables (sometimes on a 12+ hour shift), and seem to be the gold standard among health professionals.

Also edited to fix the brand name of my Swedish clogs.  Whoops."

So, testing (especially in this case) is really important, and it doesn't make sense to be denied a test.

But look at it like this.  If you (you in general, not the royal you) are asymptomatic, *you can still pass it on.* So it's actually imperative that you get tested, so you're not acting as a vector for the disease, or even worse, causing a massive outbreak.  This is the sort of shit that the CDC cares about, and actively tracks.  For a doctor to tell a patient, ""ya ok, so your partner tested positive but we're not going to test you because your dick doesn't hurt,"" is inconceivable.  Or at least, it would be a dereliction of duty and get said doctor in serious hot water.

Also this one, which I don't think I've mentioned:

(Same apartment as above, by the way.)

This was back when my husband (then fiance) and I lived in Boston proper (as opposed to a nearby suburb).  We have so. many. students. There are a bajillion colleges and universities here.

So, what you need to know is that that night, my husband and I had gone to see ""The Strangers."" Saw it in the theater for the full experience.  If you haven't seen it, it's basically a scary-ass film about a couple who are terrorized and subsequently murdered by three people in scary-ass masks.  Three people they've never met.  At the end, the female protagonist asks why these psychos are torturing her, and the reply is a simple yet terrifying, ""you were home."" Oh, and basically the way these guys begin messing with the couple is by pounding loudly on the door, late at night.  Then the action begins in earnest.

And the movie is 12 years old, so nothing there should really be a spoiler.

So anyway.  We saw ""The Strangers,"" got back to our gross apartment (student ghetto), and settled in to drink some terrible wine.  By around 2am we had a good buzz and were pretty much just hanging out.  Probably debating about music, if I I had to guess.

Out of nowhere, there were three LOUD bangs on the door.  I'm pretty sure that I nearly crapped myself.  Keep in mind, this is exactly how the movie we saw about four hours beforehand started.  I'm sure I thought, *THE MOVIE IS COMING TRUUUUUE!*

My husband opened the door, and this random guy barged right in.  Husband pushed him back onto the porch and slammed the door shut.  Then he and I just sort it looked at each other, blinking.  

And that's when the banging on the door started again. This time husband grabbed a baseball bat, preparing to chase the guy off for good.  But when he opened the door, the guy came at him full force.  (I know.) They wrestled a bit and again, husband pushed him back across the threshold.  I guess this time, there was a somewhat frightened girl with the dude, hanging back about six feet.  She apologized to my husband, explaining that the guy was her boyfriend, he was drunk, and thought our house was his.  She seemed pretty shaken.  

Husband let her know that we were calling the cops, so it would be in everyone's best interest if they just got the fuck out of there.  Somehow, she dragged him off.

Husband called the police.  I stood outside to wait for them, since it was late and I didn't want them to accidentally ring the bell for our elderly upstairs neighbors.  As I trembled on the sidewalk (still had a lot of adrenaline), I heard a woman screaming wordlessly in the distance.  *That* was really terrifying.  I can't say if it was the girl from our porch, though.

That's it.  I don't think the cops ever actually showed up, now that I think about it.

I'm sure it was just a drunk college kid, albeit an agressive and angry drunk college kid.  It's unfortunately not the first time that sort of thing happened in that neighborhood.  About a year earlier, at the house down the street, another drunk kid got the wrong apartment and tried to use the fire escape to get to the second (or third) floor door.  He braced himself against the fire escape while trying to kick the door in.  The fire escape hadn't been maintained, so it completely detached from the house as he tried to force the door.  He was killed in the fall.  Again, student ghetto."
Adoption,flhqi1u,t3_fotcrl,1585167611.0,"Can't answer all of this but -

My bio half sister found me this summer.  She was also adopted. I can't say that it makes me feel more grounded.  We're both really busy and live no where near each other, so she's still kind of... An idea, if that makes sense.  Doesn't really feel real at the moment.

After talking to her a little, I don't think I'm that interested in trying to find my birthparents, at least for a while.  I suspect that I won't like what I find.  I wouldn't call it a lack of courage; more like the *wisdom* to know that it would require an amount of mental bandwidth that I'm not willing to spend.  I have my own family and commitments, so that's pretty much where I need to put my focus and energy.  For now.  Or for always.  One thing at a time, I guess."

Obviously it's still not enough to make me abandon  my 3a.  I'm really enjoying this phone.  I was pretty sure that transitioning from Apple to Android was going to be painful and that I'd miss my iPhone, but surprisingly that's not the case."

LifeProTips,fkdcx6d,t3_fhq2ts,1584074565.0,"Waitressed for a while in my 20's. I remember a staff meeting where we were told that we'd get fired for calling in sick, even with a doctor's note.  Not legal in the slightest, but it still happens.  Most food service employees (America) can't unionize or afford a lawyer to prosecute these employers."
breakingmom,fkd8zpz,t3_fhfvag,1584071495.0,"I'm in Boston.  I have a two year old in preschool.  I'm spiraling.  Things were normal here until last night.  Then we got an email - ""school is closed for a day for cleaning!"" Then today - ""actually, it's gonna be two weeks."" Within an hour I got an email saying that her swim lessons were cancelled.

I had some nice acquaintances at swim class.  I don't really like the parents at her preschool, but at least they were other adults I could talk to, albeit superficially.  Her teacher and I have become friends and have been leaning on each other as we've watched the US hit a crisis point.  I can't see any of these people now.  

I'm close with my parents and see them almost every day, but they're both over 60 and have preexisting health conditions, so now we're separated for awhile.  Mom and I both cried when I left her house earlier today, not knowing when we'll be able to see each other.  My closest friends live in NY.

I'm an adult learner and going to night classes has also been a source of mental stimulation, along with the social aspect of class discussions.  My university just told us all not to come back.

All of my community support has vanished in a span of 48 hours. My husband works, so it's just going to be me and my daughter.  She has delayed speech, so it's pretty stressful to try to figure out her needs.

I'm worried sick about my parents.  

The thing is, the night class I was taking was about the history of pandemics.  It's totally a coincidence; we all signed up for our courses in November.  It's taught by a MD with a PhD, whose area of expertise is in history of medicine.  About a month ago he was called away to a conference about COVID-19 and when he came back he warned us that shit was about to go down. I spent the next few weeks trying to get my family ready, making sure we had a plan and enough food and  OTC/prescription meds to get us by in case we lost access for awhile.  I've spent all this time planning out the logistics that I forgot to think about the emotional fallout.  For that, I was unprepared.

I'm losing it.

Ladies - the one thing I learned in this class that is a sticking point is that the one thing that truly saved lives during the 19th century cholera epidemics in NYC was the Church.  It organized parishioners so the wealthy could donate supplies and clothing to those in need, as others fled a city on the verge of collapse.  This is not a point about religion - just that we can find help and support in community groups.  Large gatherings might be forbidden but the internet can help connect people.  We need to look out for each other and assist those in need.

Of course, I say that, but my community has splintered and I'm falling apart.  So take it for what it's worth, I guess.  Maybe it will help some of you.  Wishing you all the best."

breakingmom,fk0vug8,t1_fjksqoy,1583767283.0,"Exactly.  The thing that makes me crazy is that her car seat was on the passenger side of her car and mine was on the driver's side (she was parked on my left), which means that I had to wait for her to put her kid in *her* car seat before I could open my car door.  Which wasn't a problem!  I waited behind my car while she settled her kid in, and was happy to do so.  

It's kind of parent code, right?  (Or polite person code.) We're patient with people buckling their kids in, because it's not about us - it's about a kid's safety.  It's just... What you do.  It drives me crazy that she couldn't even afford me *that* courtesy."
