I asked because I know how difficult it can be to find motivation while in this mental state. You know what you can do to help alleviate the issues, but executing is the problem. Utilizing  the coping mechanisms in of themselves can seem an impossible task.   So negative thoughts combined with lack of coping mechanisms can lead to a negative feedback loop.

Poor concentration is a common side effect of depression. Brain being so preoccupied by negative thoughts spells doom for the attention span. 

Exercise, using supplements, or nootropics, and playing brain games helps some.  In my experience it never fully goes away. It may be something you combat for as long as your depressed."
