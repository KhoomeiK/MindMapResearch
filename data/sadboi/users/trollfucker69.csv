dating_advice,fqxqioh,t1_fqxm7fi,1589736322.0,"Oh I’m definitely a factor. Aside from high school relationships being innately toxic my issues were undiagnosed. Then I got raped trying to hook up with someone to try to forget about my ex. Then I (might have) been raped while piss-drunk *by my ex*. Then after trying to branch out a bit I got called a waste of time by one guy, then I was told I needed serious psychological help from another guy after we had a FWB situation and he decided to date a girl without telling me. Then early this year I really thought I’d have something nice with a guy, he was really sweet to me and I got zero red flags, and then he ghosted me to date a random freshman.

I consider myself toxic because I do have anxiety and mental health issues and that can cause commitment issues and problems with being certain my partner actually *likes* me, but I think my most toxic trait is that I keep letting people that don’t give two shits about me as a person fuck me up.

I’m learning though, I think. I told a guy I really liked that I didn’t want to do anything with him because I knew deep down that a relationship would be a disaster. That part’s actually true, it’s not me being insecure we just have too many differences.

That hurts a lot but I think that’s a really good sign."
