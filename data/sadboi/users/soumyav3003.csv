Fortunately though, I’ve found some genuine friends here on reddit that have been very nice to me and told me how attractive and amazing I am and for the first time in my 18 years of lifespan, I looked at myself closely into the mirror and actually found that I wasn’t ugly at all. I look absolutely fine."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fmwwtfn,t3_fxvayo,1586454427.0,Well MDD does not allow me to stay in the real world for too long. I’d say approximately 80-90% of my waking hours are spent in my paracosm.

Us daydreamers that pace only do it in private, and in public we daydream but only pull some facial expressions and we can daydream without doing any of these actions as well but it obviously isn’t that comfortable.....I’m saying that what you feel is untrue because I myself am a daydreamer that paces around and I am in my paracosm literally 80% of the time..pacing really isn’t that important tho for daydreaming..I tend to start movements only when the daydream starts to get super exciting"

MaladaptiveDreaming,fmr521m,t1_fmr3jum,1586314053.0,It is basically coping mechanism that proceeds to turn into a disorder. as time passes by we find ourselves daydreaming every moment of our life and here’s where it becomes nasty

MaladaptiveDreaming,fmp6xd7,t3_fwn0o1,1586275568.0,"Well that's pretty common in maladaptive daydreaming. It isn't weird really, it just happens because you have MDD. I too have killed myself heroically many times in my paracosms, which are usually inspired by crime/ thriller tv shows lol"

MaladaptiveDreaming,fmm53g1,t3_fw3urc,1586198950.0,"Yesss this happens to me a lot of times. It usually happens whenever I see someone else in pain. I tend to have no control over these dreams and fully put myself in the victims shoes and genuinely feel their pain. For example, in January, id made an online friend  whose loved one had commited suicide and apparently he saw that person in his nightmares and couldn't sleep peacefully, and he also had schizophrenia which made life so difficult for him. And meeting this very person changed the types of daydreams that I started to have. I'd usually be super distressed all the time because of putting myself in his place and daydreaming about all this stuff happening to me, and all this happened automatically. This increased so much that I started to have real horrible panic attacks because of imagining myself losing a loved one to suicide. But the good thing about having such kinda daydreams is that you understand what a victim is going through. It is only because of this disorder i could sympathise with that guy real bad and the desire to help and comfort him just skyrocketed."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fmm201p,t3_fv2v6b,1586197309.0,"Oh hell yes so many times. usually when i crave for death, i make up scenarios where I'm getting shot in my head or getting killed in an accident or getting brutally murdered"
