kratom,fdcestg,t3_ekibvm,1578273139.0,I think having a sky high opioid tolerance affects how Kratom will affect you. I was on fentanyl for 11 yrs at hi doses so no surprise that when I started Kratom I needed much higher doses. I have chronic pain. I use up to 100gpd. That‚Äôs way too much & I wanna taper down but I‚Äôve been at this dose for 2 yrs with no ill effects. My labs are always perfect. If you‚Äôre not opiate tolerant u can get by on much smaller doses less frequently. I typically use 10-12 grams per dose every 2-3 hours

I‚Äôm more accepting of it now that I‚Äôm older. If I were starting over I‚Äôd get on every dating site & put myself out there.

IncelsWithoutHate,fc35rh1,t1_fc2jnl3,1577382120.0,Honestly after all these years it boils down to him being asexual & part of me thinks he enjoys hurting me a great deal. Our marriage is dead & has been for years. I‚Äôve suffered badly from the rejection & trying to fix him. Btw his hormones were tested & were normal. He was never sexually assaulted. He doesn‚Äôt view pornography. He doesn‚Äôt look at women & he‚Äôs not gay. He just doesn‚Äôt care & enjoys the hurt he‚Äôs caused. Stupid me for not leaving & not seeing someone else. It‚Äôs been a total kick in the ass
IncelsWithoutHate,fc278qh,t1_fb6ol5t,1577343641.0,My life has sucked from birth & im very attractive. My husband hasn‚Äôt touched me in over 8 years & we‚Äôve been married 33 yrs. at most we had sex a handful of times in 33 yrs. I‚Äôm counting the times he initiated. I initiated all the time only to b rejected. I‚Äôm not sure what an incel is or black pills but sex isn‚Äôt just lacking in people who are unattractive. There are many people like me in sexless marriages & relationships who r good looking nonetheless. I know of many including mine.
lonely,fc25xs4,t1_fc02n13,1577341868.0,That‚Äôs a good point about feeling safe in our shell. I‚Äôm in a bad marriage & can‚Äôt get out right now but I have made my room into a wonderful sanctuary. It‚Äôs beautiful & comfortable & has soothing colors & soft bedding & my own big screen tv so I can still watch tv when he is in the living room & I can‚Äôt b around him. The lighting is soft & soothing. Thankfully I have my own bathroom too. Yes I do isolate myself because of this abusive man but it could b worse. At least I‚Äôm very comfortable . There‚Äôs no physical abuse & we stay on our own sides of the house. After 33 yrs it‚Äôs come down to this for survival sake. He‚Äôs not interested in fixing anything so I try to do nice things for myself. I eat well & spend a lot of time reading & sleeping. This is what has to b for now.
kratom,fc256z6,t3_efgg3p,1577340920.0,"What a great story! I too got started on opiates young after a botched c section at just 17 yrs old. The complications that followed got the ball rolling. At first darvocet, Vicodin & worse. More health problems developed with age & of course more pills. I was on pills for 4 decades. I finally found Kratom 2 yrs ago & never looked back. I needed pain relief & have it without pharmaceuticals. No more dealing with drs. No more feeling like an addict. I‚Äôm dependent on Kratom but I know if I want to taper down I can by reading all the posts here. To be off prescription meds is a god send."

Occasionally if I do have to ask him about transactional stuff he will absolutely find a way to start a fight or at the very least treat me badly like I‚Äôm a piece of garbage. If I had the funds I know I‚Äôd b happy getting away from him. My life wud b so different. I gotta just keep trying to find ways out

OpiatesRecovery,fbzagem,t1_fbz44xq,1577240209.0,Ask for jean if u go to Detroit. I‚Äôve never experienced so much kindness & support as RDD in Detroit. That‚Äôs rapid drug detox. They put u under then flush your system with I think naloxone & propofal  or similar drug & anesthetics & benzos. When u wake up 30 min after you‚Äôre done & just extremely exhausted. Not a shred of withdrawal. None! I was a new person. They should b screaming this from the rooftops. It was the best thing I ever did
abusiverelationships,fbz9q59,t1_fbz97y5,1577239531.0,"They won‚Äôt take me cuz I‚Äôm not battered. He stopped physical abuse 6 yrs ago when I threatened to call the police. He threw hot coffee in my face & I inhaled it. It was awful. There‚Äôs been sooo much abuse like that-pushed me down stairs, kicked me,  but at least that stuff stopped. But the verbal & mental abuse goes on. The only reason I haven‚Äôt left is financial. I‚Äôm gonna try to find things to do to distract me more & get out of the house. I‚Äôm going back to church too. I‚Äôve tried hard to find counseling but no luck. I have an $8500 deductible & nobody was Available for new patients. I live in the boonies. I just have to get stronger so that what he does isn‚Äôt as gut wrenching as it is. Many women wud just move forward but I‚Äôm broken."
abusiverelationships,fbz8ygn,t3_ef9na9,1577238822.0,"Same here. No decorations, when I asked if I cud hang up some garland I made he called me a cunt & refused. No dinner, no gifts, there won‚Äôt b any sign of Xmas here. Last week was my birthday. He went to visit relatives. I was alone & cried. I got nothing. No card no gift nothing. I knew as hateful and abusive as he is to me the rest of the year, that these days wud b no different. My family is thousands of miles away & honestly r sick & tired of telling me to leave him after all these years of hell. I wasted my life on a man who can‚Äôt love & is an abusive narcissist. Trouble is after 33 yrs of it & my health  problems I can‚Äôt get away. Theres not enough $ for 2 households. I can‚Äôt work so the best I can do is try to live a life under the same roof as my abuser. He refuses to talk to me & we live totally separate lives. He does whatever he wants & without me. He‚Äôs an empty shell. There were red flags all over in the beginning but I figured I cud fix things. Stupid. It got worse & worse. I want to tell those lucky enough to have loved ones & partners that love them to hang on tight & don‚Äôt take anything for granted. Please realize u are blessed & things cud b very different. It‚Äôs too late for me."
SuicideWatch,fbwx43y,t3_eema98,1577161797.0,Please don‚Äôt do anything rash like throwing yourself in front of a truck because there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll work & not end up worse off. I think we ought to b able to see a dr & get the same suicide drugs they use for euthanasia in Oregon & a few other places. It‚Äôs our right to live so our right to die if we need to. I‚Äôve actually looked into getting the meds but they‚Äôre in China & illegally getting them means prison. In Switzerland u can get the drug even if you‚Äôre not terminally ill.

I‚Äôm struggling to cope. We‚Äôve been married 33 yrs but it went from bad to worse a yr ago. He dusnt wanna work on anything. He lives his life & dusnt talk to me. It‚Äôs very lonely. We have to live under the same roof cuz there‚Äôs not enough $ for 2 households. I‚Äôm disabled w rheumatoid arthritis & diabetes so I can‚Äôt work. Not eligible for disability. It‚Äôs hell here. I‚Äôm so depressed that I live this way & the man I gave my life to is a stone cold prick & just threw me away. He sed I can live here & stay on my side of the house but he wants nothing to do with me.

NarcissisticAbuse,fbsr1m0,t3_eeamds,1577059059.0,"Mine is totally opposite. Silence &  stonewalling daily. He dusnt talk & it‚Äôs killed our marriage along with his narc abuse. When I talk he replies with one word or not at all. The loneliness is overwhelming. I‚Äôve put up with this for 33 years what a fool. I‚Äôve done everything possible, counseling, talking to him & pleading till I was blue in the face. Once he knew it hurt me badly he escalated it. He also withheld affection & sex. Due to health problems I can‚Äôt leave now. Shudve done it when I was young & healthy."
OpiatesRecovery,fbspbkv,t1_fbrzv1n,1577058336.0,"Please please consider rapid detox. I went in Detroit. Honest to god it was painless & saved my life because I was abusing fentanyl & knew I was gonna die. The one thing is that insurance won‚Äôt cover it. It was $7500. But by god it was either pay it or die. I was putting the patches in my mouth, instantly affecting me hard. I had family problems. Honestly there‚Äôs no paws!! I felt better than I had in the past 11 years of using. It was like being reborn. Idk if there‚Äôs other ways to cover the cost now; I had it done in 2011. I‚Äôd check it out."
kratom,fbsnycm,t3_ee7x63,1577057794.0,"I‚Äôm a woman 59, chronic pain patient & very heavy user for 2 years now. Used it to get off Tramadol. I sweat every day after dosing almost each time. It‚Äôs annoying but goes away fairly fast. That‚Äôs the cost of doing business. When I was on the fentanyl patches I sweated like crazy. My clothes wud b soaked & I cudnt go out in public my face literally wud drip down & soak my hair too. It was horrible. Glad I‚Äôm off all pharmaceuticals"
OpiatesRecovery,fbrewu7,t3_edhpk3,1577042234.0,Yes I too used Prozac before quitting to offset the loss of antidepressant in the Tramadol. U can also use gabapentin if u can get it. And clonidine. For sleeping I used trazadone. U can use the gaba for the rls too. It‚Äôs doable if I can anyone can but get Kratom if u have to
OpiatesRecovery,fbredg8,t3_edhpk3,1577042042.0,By all means get Kratom!! I did to get off Tramadol & was taking up to 40 tabs a day! Kratom is available online & in smoke shops. Get the reds. It saved my ass cuz the wd wudve killed me ct.
OpiatesRecovery,fbrb2fk,t1_fbqpog7,1577041193.0,"Talk about becoming intolerant of minimal pain, when I ct oxy contin 240 mg a day for 2 years I went to the hospital for help & I cudnt even stand the blood pressure cuff! It felt like agony! Btw they made me withdraw then on day 3 they came in with a fentanyl patch 100 mcg & without any discussion whatsoever put it on my shoulder! It‚Äôs didn‚Äôt know what it was. I was flying & that nite I woke up gasping for air. It suppressed my breathing. I was on day 3 which was starting to get better from the wd & they push me back into opiods!! That started an 11 yr usage. Finally I wanted offof everything so went to Detroit for rapid drug detox which saved my life with no wd except exhaustion. I have chronic pain & now I use Kratom to manage it. Yeah I‚Äôm addicted but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than opioids."
OpiatesRecovery,fbr86nv,t1_fbj9tvq,1577040318.0,Can u use Kratom to get off it? I did to get off Tramadol & it worked well. Now I have to taper off it but very much the lesser of 2 evils
OpiatesRecovery,fbr6ak8,t1_fbjfn4l,1577039667.0,Amen exactly
OpiatesRecovery,fbr4kdj,t1_fbl6y5c,1577039074.0,I had to use Kratom to get off the shit. It was terrible. Was on Tramadol 8 yrs then my rheumatologist cut me off & sed I had to go to a pain dr. I decided no just get off. I was abusing the hell out of them. It was bad. I felt ok after 3-4 days BUT that‚Äôs with Kratom & having been on Prozac so no wd just exhaustion. I highly recommend using it to get off this demon drug. Of course now I have to wean down on Kratom but I‚Äôm gonna taper slowly. It‚Äôs very much the lesser of 2 evils
mentalhealth,fbqiaxb,t1_fbplq2l,1577031989.0,Me too it was awful getting off Effexor. I finally had to take Prozac to get off. It. The brain zaps & visual disturbances & exhaustion were horrible. Paxil does the same thing
lonely,fbqgyhw,t1_fbqg0xy,1577031550.0,Me too. I use Kratom & take waaaay too much. It‚Äôs hard not to feel less than when u did nothing wrong. I‚Äôve asked him a million times no response. It‚Äôs him that‚Äôs the problem. Maybe it‚Äôs the same with u. Maybe she‚Äôs incapable of having a successful relationship. Many people aren‚Äôt. More people divorce than stay married. All u can do is keep trying. I too wish u the best
lonely,fbqel8r,t3_ee2bcq,1577030917.0,"I empathize especially with your statement that u feel locked out of what‚Äôs important the most. That‚Äôs exactly how I feel. Family has always been my first priority. I did what I was supposed to do in a marriage & still it never worked. The family dinners, holidays together, raising kids, & especially someone to grow old with-all denied me."
lonely,fbqdn84,t1_fbq9jlu,1577030682.0,"Yes it feels like we‚Äôre not good enough or defective in some way I know the feeling. Try to tell yourself just because u have a partner dusnt mean it‚Äôll b happy & all sunshine. A bad relationship is the loneliest thing of all. I‚Äôm in one. It‚Äôs awful. The happiest people I know r the ones with hobbies & jobs and interests. Ironically the unhappiest r the married ones. It‚Äôs unbelievable the cheating, drug use, alcoholism, porn addiction u name it I‚Äôve seen it."
lonely,fbqa4jx,t1_fbq2yfy,1577029743.0,Yeah but I always think to myself we‚Äôre not seeing all the shit & dysfunction that‚Äôs going on behind closed doors either. For every happy couple there are a dozen more miserable ones. From the outside my marriage probably looks perfectly normal but it is living nitemare in reality. Listen to the stories wives & husbands tell & look on Reddit. It‚Äôs appalling. I gotta wonder if it‚Äôs even possible to have a solid functional marriage these days
