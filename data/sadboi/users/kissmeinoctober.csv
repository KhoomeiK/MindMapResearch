Autistic,fbtq0ip,t3_eed13q,1577089703.0,"You should look up the social exchange theory. I got a degree in communication to help with talking to people, and that theory brought be a lot of comfort. It explains that all relationships are like an equation of benefits and costs and that people generally want benefits to outweigh the costs. 

I live by this and I think I always have. But I notice my friends have a very hard time with it because they will let friendships, relationships, and jobs continue until the costs have long outweighed the benefits. They have to be told that it's okay to let go.

I too look for people by how they benefit me, but I don't think it's bad. I think of it as a skill.

So I have had the most luck with OkCupid in the past. It's not one of the specific branded autistic sites, but for some reason I find a lot of other autistic people on there and the additional questions have really helped me in conversation. 

There's a myriad of sites but I think one problem that exists is most of the sites are kind of sausage fests. It's totally easy for me as a woman to go on a dating site because boys are diagnosed so often. But when women are barely diagnosed it's a little harder to find. 

I say all that to say that, after thinking about your situation, one of those sites might not work for you as well. 

But also have you ever used bumble? It's really good if you have trouble initiating the conversation. The women have to message first. 

Feel free to pm me at any point if you have questions. I got a degree in this stuff because initially I did not know how to talk to other people and while I definitely still don't naturally, I have like 500 persuasive theories memorized by heart that have been effective for trying to meet romantic partners.

But you should talk to like a school advocate or your dean of students to put you in contact with some director of residency. It's pretty different at each school. If you explain this case it honestly seems like you can go the route that you just fled an abusive situation and obtaining this information would cause more harm than good. If you graduated high school in the state you're applying in generally they'll accept a diploma. If not, there's forms you can do to be considered in state without her.

AskReddit,f32iql9,t3_dfa6it,1570611988.0,"I'm currently living with an exotic dancer and a (very rich) conservative Presbyterian girl whose mom was a preacher. We're all sorority sisters but I'm from a chapter across the country. 

It doesn't take long to figure out which end of the roommate spectrum I'm on. There's a massive pride flag hanging on my wall but since it's not a rainbow flag, Christian roommate has no idea what it is. I could tell her but she cried for three days when she found out our roommate was a stripper. She has no idea that I'm not a completely innocent educator. 

But yeah it's been a wild three months. I have an eating disorder. Christian girl compares my body, her body, and dancers body constantly. I manage said disorder with a keto diet. She decided she'd do keto. Then wanted no help and said we were calling her fat and sabotaging her for trying to help. Then she brought home this guy with a super sketchy backstory and he showed up at our house talking about a porn star he met in a bar...the first time we met him. He was shit face and drove himself. She didn't know he was drunk. I had to explain it to her the next morning. He drove drunk to her house three more times and then ghosted her. Then, weirdly my sorority little died in a freak car accident and my partner came to console me, but Christian girl got there first. So we all went to get food so I could cry into my salad and she suddenly developed a crush on my partner. Then she got obsessed with my cat. 

She went around our house listening to the artists my partner listens to and then tried to fuck with my cats food because she said I was feeding her too much. And I thought the crush on my partner was just like a small little thing but it continued for at least six weeks and she always brought it up. Then she would bring people over and they'd inspect my cat to tell me it was too fat. (She's a perfectly healthy weight, she's just a fluffy terrorist.) She tried to invite herself to the birthday trip my partner planned for me so I had to switch the weekend of my trip. She was very mad. I now can't have my partner at the house anymore because it gets so uncomfortable. I'm not insecure, like if you want my partner you go for it friend but I doubt it'd work. It's just the premise of how creepy it is.

What really caught me off guard was when she brought her childhood best friend in. She told her friend I was bipolar ""in case I had taken my meds"" before she even told her my name. I don't even remember this chicks name and she was at our house for like three hours but that was pertinent information.

Then she brought her mom over. They took the leaf out of our kitchen table and told the dancer (who owns our house) she should put it in the shed. She didn't understand why we were upset that her mom rearranged our house without asking. 

She also was like oh, I think you'll like my friend. You have similar stories. Her mom did meth while she was pregnant with her. I was just like oh, she sounds great but WHO SAYS THAT. My mom is just gay! Like I have a master's degree (if I finish my thesis by December) and I literally am the youngest person to ever have the job I do???

And this is small but the dancer baked cupcakes and had them cooling to take to a party. Christian girl came in and ATE ONE and didn't even ask. Other roommate was just kind of like what the fuck.


Like she has no idea at all it's like she's totally oblivious. I've never seen anything like it. 

She also took me to a fried chicken place on my birthday (I'm from Nashville) and then said that they just had a ""new spin on American cuisine"" and it was literally a southern diner. I was just kind of dumbfounded. 

She told me she grew up with not a lot of money but enough to get by. Her dad is a silicon valley executive (who basically insinuated I was mentally slow??) and their house just sold for 3 million dollars.


It's just been a very confusing journey. I needed a break so I took my cat and I've been gone for almost a month. I tell them it's so I can focus on my thesis but really it's just really weird to live at home right now."
