careerguidance,fnetfnh,t1_fnet516,1586895541.0,The only thing I am worried about is what they might think ;_; I mean the guy who interviewed me said I was perfect for the job and he was the one who had approached me in the first place.  So I don’t want him to get an wrong impression due to some silly mistake
careerguidance,fneshqr,t1_fnesaof,1586895059.0,I am a sophomore at college and Someone had asked me to write a research paper and I ended up attaching that ;_;
college,flyj1eg,t1_flyil95,1585603068.0,I completely understand but he could have worded it more you know nicely instead of making assumptions. I felt really awful after the impulse reply and did send an apology email even though I made sure both time I was not rude or disrespectful
college,fly4pv1,t1_fly2wef,1585595492.0,They usually email us the announcements and everything. We have these printed books that contain everything. All details about the course. So I never felt the need to look into the online portal when I have it right infront of me. I have done great in classes where I never ever needed to go on just like this one. So idk why he replied to me like that when he had always been really nice to me in class. My response might not be the best but I did reply to him will all respect and I was nice enough to email him again and apologize for the impulse reply :(
depression,fkqj264,t1_fkqhluk,1584447488.0,"Istg you just made me day :,( I’ve been crying for the last 4 hours cuz I can’t seem to find peace. My Motto in life is “to be a good human being” I try to help as many people I can. You know how people say they find peace at home sadly I don’t. It sad but I am happier when I’m away.  I have always been grateful for what my parents have given me. I mean I have gotten to this point in life and I’m turning 20 soon. The sad reality is my mom never mentions price or anything like that when it comes to my younger siblings. They literally got everything since they were born. My brother (who’s 9 btw) got his phone recently. I didn’t have one till I was 17. To top that off my parents didn’t get me that. It was a gift from my uncle. I was never allowed to leave the house and even in the evening. My siblings stay out past 10. When my mom talks to my sister she is all smiles and laughs. When she talks to me she starts of with sarcastic little taunts. At times I just want to hear a simple hello. I always wonder what I’ve done to be treated this way. Is it because I’m not a ideal child? Is it because I have set boundaries and limited myself to toxic behaviors? Or is it because I do what I like and what makes me happy ? Whenever little arguments like these take place she mentions all the things she bought me. She at times tells me she won’t buy shit for me on the future. I was so done with it all that I started looking for jobs and I eventually got a part time. The salary isn’t much but it’s enough to buy myself something nice time to time. I keep myself distracted from stressful things like this. I think I have applied for over 7 jobs currently XD"
depression,fkqes1x,t1_fkqelav,1584443100.0,No I totally understand. They weren’t my antidepressants. It was just a couple of meds I wasn’t using. She wanted to get them exchanged at the pharmacy for something else. She told me that the were expensive and that i was just wasting money. So I told her when I get my salary I would pay her back and then she got triggered and said “ you always think it’s about the money!” I mean that’s why you were going to get them exchanged right ? I don’t even know why I’m telling you all this I just wanted to vent it all out.
depression,fkqdi1h,t1_fkqcr5g,1584441591.0,It started when I went back to my dorm to get a bunch of stuff and she asked me to bring my meds. In hurry I forgot. As soon as I got back and told her I didn’t bring everything she went on and on calling me useless and saying my sister would never do this and that and that’s when I had a complete mental breakdown. She asked my aunt who is staying with us about the meds and my aunt tried to cover up cuz she feared I would be blasted upon. She said I did. When my mom asked me to show them and I said I didn’t that’s when she called me a liar.  I didn’t wanna tattle my aunt out. And that’s how we ended up here. All I did was ignore her and walk away. I told her I would talk to her when I’m in the right state of mind. But she kept calling and I refused to pick up cuz I know it would get worse. Little did I know avoiding it would also make it more than worse -.- and now she blocked me lmao
depression,fdd2m8l,t1_fdd2cgm,1578292284.0,My family has always been my trigger point and I try so hard to accept that cuz you know they are my family of course...since I was young I had always been caged basically they decided what to do and how to do it and never left a choice to me. Now when I am finally old enough to make a choice which is seek therapy they say I’m being dramatic and I’m acting stupid and insane. I’ve been going through all this for the past 6 years and it this point I’ve gone past my limit
depression,fdd1lg2,t1_fdd15jg,1578291170.0,The thing is I go to uni and therapy at the same time and it has been helping me a lot. She said I was wasting money and time and she told me “what’s the point when you still acting like a little psycho” I was diagnosed with ocd and anxiety and it’s so hard for me to do daily tasks and she doesn’t seem to get that. Being told over and over again that  all I do is waste money on bs is so upsetting
depression,fd7d84x,t3_ek60m6,1578202653.0,People like us never felt loved. We try to be kind because we don’t want people to hate us and that feeling of appreciation and comfort by others who say “you’re so kind “ helps us get through a rough day especially when we have lost all hope
depression,fd5mcv5,t1_fd5lzxe,1578179031.0,I’ve been doing that for 5 years now. It did get to the point where I started making up things that never happened cause I couldn’t differentiate between reality and fantasy. But I felt happy until people started saying it was weird of me think so.
depression,fd5j7b7,t1_fd5iz94,1578178183.0,I do that as well. I imagine myself with friends I’ve never had and have fun conversations  go on imaginary adventures with them in my head.
depression,fcd3tv5,t3_eh2qf4,1577606011.0,I say this all the time I want to but I’m not able to it’s like I’m scared but I am tired of trying my best but I’m also done with not trying

Dreams,fbgprof,t3_ed5oja,1576855740.0,Isn’t it better you don’t hear other people’s crap
depression,fbfou6m,t3_eczhm3,1576816221.0,Go visit her and spend time with her. She needs you there. Tbh I don’t even get why your family would even say something like that to you.  If they get upset by this than so be it. What’s the worse that could happen? You’re doing something great you’re being there for someone you appreciate and it’s sending a message to  your friend  saying that there are people who care for her.
relationships,fbfoipe,t3_ecyhsf,1576815959.0,As a person who suffers from ocd myself I can relate to his mom but however that doesn’t give anyone the right to push people around even myself. She better learn to accommodate to you and your boyfriend you’re also part of the family.As far as your boyfriend is concerned...a mom is a mom and it’s his mum. So I understand why he’s trying his best to be “a good son.” Maybe you should try talking to him cuz even I would be upset if someone took down my ornaments. It doesn’t always have to end with a fight and if he apologized to you for doing that then I’m pretty sure he would get where you’re coming from.
depression,fb6v95z,t3_ebhs7s,1576561677.0,It’s better to be diagnosed at an early age then later on in life. I clearly remember me being 14 struggling and thinking that it was just part of puberty and change. All the stress and anxiety built up and once I was 19 I was at my worst phase in my life. You have a lot to look up to trust me and you can do this
depression,f2uw8jo,t3_ded44d,1570432213.0,Want to show people that broken people can be fixed
depression,f2uw6e4,t3_de5d5f,1570432122.0,Tbh I already live in that world. Everyday I forget what reality is cause I am too busy in my own imagination. I come up with scenarios and imaginary people and live with them in my head. Might sound like a fucked up person but my therapist said sometimes it’s better  this way   :)
depression,f2uw1ko,t3_de9tqy,1570431926.0,"It’s funny how people are all about themselves. Whenever I talk about what I’m going through they go like “oh dude same” and then it’s about them and once again a person who suffers anxiety(me) is pushed in the corner. It’s takes us ages to finally open up to people and the  first thing we have to hear is stuff like this. It’s great that they are opening up but seriously why only when we decided to. Choose some other time, some other day let us vent out our emotions but instead in the end we end up once again holding them back cause we are scared that we might come out as too dramatic just cause we want them to listen to “US.”"
AnxietyDepression,f0o8rr8,t3_d5tgd0,1568801842.0,All the time... it’s this weird sensation like your heart clenches and it’s so hard to breathe. At times this happens I can’t even sit still I become really really restless and it’s so heartbreaking cuz you don’t know what’s even happening and it feels like death.
ForeverAlone,f0hsla9,t3_d4w9ki,1568629498.0,"I’ve been told by people  that he reason why I’m still single is because men are afraid of “ideal “ women...idk how much of that is true? But I do get a lot of compliments about my looks, figure,my personality  and skills. I’m pretty much aware that boys do have a crush on me but they’re always shy to approach and I never got why. I mean it doesn’t make me feel better just worse cuz I’m not sure if I’m worth anyone’s attention anymore."
AnxietyDepression,exzu158,t3_cuv0uz,1566670679.0,I know how that feels I used to be fat when I was younger and I got called out for that all the time. I lost so much weight now that I am all grown but still when I look in the mirror I see myself as I was when I was younger. I guess it sticks to our head and  despite people telling you that you look “fine”
depression,exibqno,t1_exi9pk7,1566325070.0,Every day is such a struggle tbh and it’s so tiring I told my mom about my disorder but my family seems to think anxiety isn’t a big deal. They seriously don’t know how I feel. “You’ll get over it “ Every single day I have a panic attack even if it’s a minor inconvenience .Just wish people were more understanding...
