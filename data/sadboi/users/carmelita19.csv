I struggled with BED and restricting for years before recovering, and when I would open up and tell people that I had a problem with binge eating, because I was so skinny and would workout and restrict like crazy after my binges, nobody believed that I had a problem. But, it doesn’t matter what anybody else thinks. I got so tired of being sick and tired, and tired of the binge, guilt and restrict cycle, that I needed a solution that could work because I was out of hope and was beyond desperate to feel normal around food and my body.

I am apart of a fellowship that has lots of phone meetings, but also live meetings too, depending on where you live. I will also say, It’s easy to get caught up in wanting the ‘perfect’ sponsor, and wanting your sponsor to sponsor you the way you want, but for me I was so hopeless and desperate, and was tired of being sick and tired, that I was ready to do anything that my sponsor told me to do. I found a sponsor after calling into a meeting and hearing the recovery in the voices of the members. They sounded happy and positive, and also sounded like they had similar battles with compulsive eating, and were no longer fighting. I wanted what they had, and the first sponsor that reached out to me, I asked to help me. The rest is history. Just keep an open mind, and be willing to accept new ideas. I hope I was able to help. Please reach out anytime."

Everything I had tried to control my food behaviors was no longer working. I was toast. That’s how I ended up in OA, and worked the steps with a sponsor quickly. As others have stated, there are a ton of different fellowships and meetings out there. You have to kinda feel them out and see where you feel you want to be. Really listen to the recovery of the speakers. Does it sound like they are no longer fighting food, or does it sound like they are still fighting? Do they have what you want, or not really? In finding a sponsor don’t be picky. If we are drowning, and someone is offering a life jacket, we aren’t going to wait for the one with the perfect design and color right? I’m happy to offer you suggestions for meetings if you would like, and can help anytime. Just send me a PM if your interested. I’m in a fellowship that has phone meetings during the week. :)"

FoodAddiction,fnjow0i,t3_g1xhlu,1587003611.0,"Hey there, I just read your post, and can relate so much to your feelings, as I was actually in your shoes with my Mom who was a struggling recovering alcoholics or years. I’m a recovered member in a 12 step group for my compulsive eating, and can tell you that the illness is just as cunning and baffling to us, as it is to you. A compulsive eater may be ok for a bit of time cutting out ‘binge foods.’ They may even be able to follow a meal plan or diet for a few months or a year, but if the compulsive eater becomes a real deal chronic type, then unfortunately they will not be able to use those methods to stop their compulsive eating, or whatever their behavior around food may be. Once you cross over the imaginary line into the chronic variety, there is no return. They have lost their control over power of choice. It took me many years to grasp this, but I know now that I can’t help an alcoholic recover, anymore than you can help your Mom. We are just not powerful enough. Your Mom will have to find her bottom, in order to rise to the top. I can tell you, that there are a ton of different overeaters anonymous groups out there. A lot of them focus on the food being the problem, but in my experience, the food was never the problem for me. I can compulsively eat on a salad or broccoli if it was yummy enough. You know? So, for me, I needed to let go of controlling the food, because I tried cutting out ingredients or foods from my diet, and it always ended up backfiring on me. So for me, I needed something more than a meal plan. Meal plans and diets made me crazier. I was able to find a group that uses the same 12 step program that the pioneers of AA used, and it has led me to freedom from obsession over food and my body. I hope she’s able to find the OA fellowship that helps her recover and as hard as it is to watch, you have to step back and let her find her way. Reach out via PM anytime. I’m really happy to help with anything."

I remember trying to starve myself to get my eating under control, one to go on a huge binge later that day. I couldn’t win no matter what I tried..and believe me, I tried everything short of surgery to stop the insanity. For me, the more I tried controlling the food, the worse I got. It wasn’t until coming to OA and working the steps that I was able to let go of controlling my food. Today looks completely different for me. I’m no longer fighting temptation, I can eat a piece of cake and not freak out or eat the whole cake anymore. I’m no longer obsessed with my body and weight.

My whole life used to  revolve around when I could eat, what I could or couldn’t eat, and also what my weight was every day, so I could reward myself. I couldn’t stop the insanity. The thing I learned, was that no matter if I was having the best day of my life, whether or not I had lost weight or gained weight, the food wasn’t my problem, it actually was my mind that came up with the great idea to compulsively eat. I knew it wasn’t the food triggering me, because I tried cutting out ingredients so many times, only to eat everything else that I cut out. I’m recovered from compulsive food behaviors today, and from the obsession with my body, and it’s been amazing to be able to live a life that is not revolving around my obsession. The whole world is going thru a tough time right now, and it hasn’t been easy, and I’m  not sure if I helped you at all, but if you need anything at all, I’m happy to help anytime."

overcomebingeeating,fj715x9,t1_fj5rrxp,1583084325.0,"Oh yeah.. you story sounds very similar to my journey. I would be successful for some time on diets or meal plans, but then because I restricted so much, my mind would get crazy obsessed with food, and I would get irritable and discontent, and would end up on a binge, and it didn’t matter on what foods either, I would find something to binge on, even if I didn’t have any of my binge foods to eat in the house. I would eat a whole bag of rice cakes or find something else to compulsively eat, because ultimately the food wasn’t my problem, it was actually my mind telling me that food would make me feel better. For me, the more I tried controlling the food, the worse I got. Because my problem was actually that I used food for my solution to my problems, and no matter what kind of day I was having, I could end up in the food. I could be having the best day of my life, and my mind would make up reasons to eat. I tried everything to stop the insanity, and I was not only obsessed with food, but was obsessed with my body. I would weigh myself every morning, and that got my head spinning. It ended up either making me really happy or totally depressed, and I lost no matter what, because my mind made me think I could eat whatever I wanted if I lost weight, and my mind would also take me back to the food if I gained weight, to get ease and comfort. Thank goodness I’m no longer obsessing over food and my body, and life has taken on new meaning. I’m actually able to have relationships with others today, instead of being focused on my body and what I can and can’t eat. Hope this helps answer some questions for you."

I could count calories, and go on diets, and maybe I would white knuckle it for a bit, but it was working.

I tried everything to manage my weight and compulsive eating, and they worked for awhile until eventually all the diets/apps/ therapy/nutritionists/self-help books stopped working. I couldn’t follow another diet or meal plan to save my life, but I was so tired of the endless cycle, and I knew I had to find another way to live my life, or I was going to go crazy or die. I eventually found relief and a solution that worked, and if your ready to be done for good and all, and have tried everything you can to stop and it’s not working, it could help you too. PM me anytime and I would love to talk more."
bingeeating,f2z6xi1,t3_det1dh,1570508476.0,"I totally get how your feeling, but binge eating can be a slow killer. It can cause all sorts of health problems, and could be fatal, given the right circumstances. I totally know how isolating the illness can be, and how deep depression can slowly take over your life. It’s no way to live. I seriously had no idea how I was going to stop my binge eating. I tried everything to manage the decision to stop, but every firm resolution I started ended up with another binge, which would start the whole cycle over again. Feeling guilt and remorse from the last binge, which causes you to set a firm resolution not to binge again, which leads us into our next binge. It is exhausting. Luckily I  finally got out of the cycle, and I just wanted to say your not alone, and I’m able to help if you need anything."
BingeEatingDisorder,f29u615,t3_d8dvy0,1570104228.0,"Oh, yep.. I was once totally in this same mindset. Convinced that I was going to binge to my death, because I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t find anything that worked to stop. At first I thought the food was my problem, and if I could only find the perfect diet or fitness program I would be fine.. but nope! I tried so many things to stop the cycle of binge, guilt remorse, but I kept binge eating. But the reality was, I used food for my ease and comfort for life. The food actually wasn’t my problem at all! It was my mind that was the issue because it took me to the food to solve my problems. I could be happy, sad, lonely and my mind would say, ‘hey.. food will help.’ I set expectations on how I wanted to look, or how I thought I should look and act, or how others should act. I thought if only I had the perfect body, or weight or clothing size that I would be happy, but nope.. that only caused me to spin out of control in my illness. I isolated myself and became really lonely and depressed. My illness started to cause my whole life to become unmanageable, but I was able to find a way out of the depression and misery, and I just wanted to share that your not alone, and there is a way out of the misery, if your wanting out. If your done trying to figure this thing out, and are wanting to be done with compulsive eating for good and all, I’m happy to help. You can send me a PM anytime."

OvereatersAnonymous,f1srxwn,t1_f1q2j6x,1569733211.0,"This was a big thing I know I was confused about when I first started working the steps with my sponsor. I have learned that an allergy for a compulsive eater is not the same as an alcoholic. The alcoholic does have a true allergy to any form of alcohol. The first part of our illness centers in our mind, which is true for all addicts, but with the compulsive eater, our mind gets us to take that first compulsive bite of food, whatever the food may be, which then sets off the phenomenon of craving, and then we can’t stop. Our allergy is not actually to food types, because if it was, then we could simply eliminate those foods, and not need a 12 step program. A diet club or meal plan would be all that we needed, but it’s not about the food. Its all about the mental obsession, and the It’s that first compulsive bite, which causes us to have an abnormal reaction (allergy), which sets us up on our spree or binge."

I used to fight the hard truth that I was sick with compulsive overeating, but once I hit my bottom, and was no longer able to control it, I had to face reality. That I was different. I ate food to escape life.,food was my solution to life. I could be happy, sad, tired, celebrating, lonely... you name it, my mind tricked me into eating. Normal eaters will never understand us, and it’s so awesome you reached out for help/advice on here. If your interested in quitting the obsession and insanity around food, please reach out anytime.

OvereatersAnonymous,f0yr0nh,t3_d79xl9,1569076088.0,"Hey there, I am so sorry to hear about your struggle right now. I know exactly how your feeling right now, as I couldn’t figure out why I had such a problem with food. I couldn’t stop binge eating. I tried cutting out my so called ‘triggers.’ But, that never seemed to help, and I would binge on clean foods. I was a mess and was hopeless. I had lost my power of choice to stop and stay stopped. At some point in my eating disorder illness, I crossed over the imaginary line and became chronic. That’s why all the diets and detoxes and meal plans stopped working for me. I was out of options! But, all that is different now. If you have tried everything to control and manage your eating, and you can’t stop once you start, you may be powerless, and the only option is to try something new, and to connect with a power greater than yourself and work the 12 steps. I know you say you have been clean and sober, did you work the 12 steps vigorously everyday? Do you have an AA sponsor? I understand how confusing it can be to go from one addiction to another. I can help. If your ready to stop trying to figure this thing out, please send me a PM."
bingeeating,f0uuj50,t3_d6nfzh,1568951225.0,"Hey there, I was once really obsessed with my body and weight. I was so wrapped up in how I looked and what I weighed, but I wanted to keep going. I wanted to be thinner. I thought I would be so happy if I was had the perfect body and weight. This is when my binge eating got crazy..I would binge maybe once a month, then it kept creeping up from there. Twice a month, three times, then it was every week. Nobody knew I was binge eating, because I restricted and over-exercised, but I was dying inside. All I cared about 24/7 was what I could or couldn’t eat, when I could workout, what my weight was. I was so lonely and depressed, and I isolated myself. I tried everything to try and stop the insanity, but I couldn’t stop. I tried diets, detoxes, therapists, nutritionists, self-help books. Nothing worked for long. I was hopeless, and I was tired of trying to figure out why I was the way I was. So, I thought I was just going to continue down the road doing what I was doing, trying to blot out from my consciousness the pain and suffering, but I found a way out of the darkness by following some spiritual principles. If the tools you have learned are no longer working to help, then you may have lost the power of choice and you may need a power greater than yourself to help you. I’m happy to help anytime.

EatingDisorders,ezc3y24,t3_czydth,1567829518.0,"I hope your doing ok now! I totally understand what your going thru. I have dealt with anorexic tendencies as well as binge eating and purging via over-exercise so that I could be ‘skinny.’ I would weigh myself every day, and it always determined my mood for the day, and also how much I could or couldn’t eat. I then started binge eating, and that made everything worse. The cycle couldn’t be broken. I wanted to stop the insanity of worrying about my food, body and weight, but I couldn’t stop. I tried fitness programs, diets, therapy. You name it, I was done. I wanted to live a life that I could be free from obsessing over food and my body 24/7. After years of suffering, I found a solution to the insanity. I worked the 12 steps with a recovered sponsor, and had a change of heart and mind, and I was able to stop weighing myself, or worrying about my body. It has been so freeing.

OvereatersAnonymous,ez8yr5k,t1_ez8ewl4,1567766654.0,"Here are some questions to ask yourself.. to know if you really are needing a 12 step program. Maybe your not the chronic type yet, or maybe you are? If you can answer ‘no’ to these questions, then you may be the chronic type, and only a power greater than yourself can help. 

1. If, when you honestly want to, can you stop and stay stopped? (I’m know I used to tell myself I was done binge eating, only to find myself with my head in the food a couple days later, I was unable to manage the decision to stop, so my life was unmanageable where food was involved)

2. When eating, do you find that you have little control over the amount you take? (Once you start, you can’t stop.. you start with one bite, and head into a binge?) (If you cant start and stop, on your own, you are powerless)"
OvereatersAnonymous,ez8erds,t3_czvjou,1567741290.0,"As many have already said, listening to podcasts and meetings are great, but if your the real deal chronic compulsive eater, like me, the only way to have a complete change of heart and mind, and to recover from compulsive eating, is to work the steps with a recovered sponsor as soon as possible.

bingeeating,ez8e3d5,t3_d08g8g,1567740769.0,"The big thing to ask yourself is, when you start compulsively eating, are you able to stop yourself? Are you doing it a lot, or is it only sometimes?"
bingeeating,ez27v31,t3_czufa6,1567653295.0,"I totally get where your coming from. I definitely thought I had certain foods that caused me to binge, so I did experiments and cut my so called ‘trigger foods’ out. You know what happened? I ended up binge eating on healthy/non-trigger foods! I was really confused as to why I was not able to control my eating. After many attempts at trying to control my food and body, I realized it must be something more than just a food ingredient that was causing me to compulsively eat and binge. Sure enough, after years of wasting money on therapy, nutritionists, detoxes, diets, tracing calories and macros. I figured it out. after working a 12 step program for compulsive eating. My mind is wired to use food as its solution to life. I used food when I was happy, sad, lonely, celebrating, mad, etc... I always thought if i could just find the right diet, or workout program, I would be fine. Nope. I wasn’t. So, as I may lean towards certain food types during a binge, it’s not the actual ingredients that are causing the binge, it’s actually what is going on in my mind, that is causing me to reach for food for ease and comfort."

It was all about the game and that mental obsession with food so that I could get my ease and comfort. The only thing that helped me was working the 12 steps, and living in steps 10-12 on a daily basis. I have days too where my mind makes up stories on why I should start tracking food again, but I’m able to see the true from the false now and can reach out to my higher power and my sponsor, and when I do that, and then find another compulsive eater to help, I stay recovered."

We have to move forward, because really we have no idea if anything would have turned out differently. We don’t know for sure.

I tried so many methods to control my eating, but they would help for some time, and then stop working. All the diets and self-help books I bought over the years, and all the therapy I tried never made me feel better.

There are lots of different OA meetings these days, and you really have to find your own path. I will say from my own experience, that working the 12 steps with a sponsor and by practicing the spiritual principles outlined in the Big Book of Alcoholics, is how I was able to find recovery from my compulsive food behaviors. All it took was me dialing into a phone meeting and listening to the recovered members sharing. They had what I wanted. I’m happy to help with anything. I’m also a recovered sponsor.

I stuck to crazy eating plans, and worked out too much to control my body. Today is different for me because I practice the 12 spiritual principles and recovered from my illness.
