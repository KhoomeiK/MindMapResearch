But I decided I wanted to work hard and live this life, as painful as it is, so that I could at least try to make a difference in someone else's life. Don't let this one perspective of the world rob you of everything else the world has to offer."

singapore,exedpr8,t3_cs2byf,1566211026.0,"THERAPY. For a long time I thought I was fucked up because of the childcare center that I went to, where the teachers bullied me and pushed me down to push the other kids up. ""Look, you're doing so much better than her! She's so slow and you're so smart, keep going!"" That kind of stuff. They got the kids to join in on the bullying too. I never told my parents because I thought I deserved it.

After years of insecurity and a lot of self-reflection, I realised it wasn't just because of that one childcare center, but it was the repeated exposure to my Mom's manipulation for two decades of my life. She would tell me I'm shit and that my friends are all pretending to like me and I can't trust them to tell me the truth. Instead I should trust my Mom because she loves me and wants me to stop being shit.

It takes practice. Learn to catch things that don't add up. Write them down, and dispute it. When someone says you have to get all A's just to survive, write ""I can try my best, but my grades don't define me. If I fail, it's not the end of the world and I can try again."" When someone says that everyone is evil, they're out to get you and you should trust no one, write ""Mom, I know you love me, but that isn't true."""
