AskReddit,fmblnn4,t3_ftny3x,1585928796.0,"Long rant coming hot in 3, 2, 1....

Let me start by saying that I have a good paying job. The team is able to work from home but for me to do my job it requires me to be at the office. Well, since I‚Äôm ‚Äúworking from home‚Äù I‚Äôm supposed to report with my boss in the morning with a list of things to do (that I have to come up with) and at the end of the day I send an update with what I achieved. I am in my late 30s and I feel like I‚Äôm a child who has to report to mom. 
The rest of the team is actually working while I‚Äôm here reading and doing book reports to send to my boss. I feel so useless. 

I been ‚Äúworking from home‚Äù for 2 weeks and I‚Äôve gained weight.

My husband and roommate keep making comments on ‚Äúoh poor you‚Äù because I‚Äôm home and they assume I‚Äôm on some sort of vacation (they are both having to go to work) but they don‚Äôt understand how this is mentally messing with me. There is only so much cleaning I can do, so much talking to the dogs until I start to feel crazy. 

I am scared for my job, I feel useless, I feel defeated, I‚Äôm constantly fighting tears because i don‚Äôt know how else to handle it. I just want to go back to work and for thing to be normal again."
