Anxiety,fp9dqg9,t3_gbnjuv,1588423347.0,I'm in my third year at uni and absolutely terrified of life after lockdown. All of my plans for my life after uni have either been ruined completely or I'm not sure whether I'll be able to go through with them. I was already anxious about moving from being a student to the big wide world but I've never felt stress like this
AskMen,fir4a34,t3_f94v5k,1582657076.0,I'm a uni student and work a part-time job on the side. Whenever I get back from work my bf will always offer to make me a hot drink without fail. He also often grabs me something to eat as my work hours means I can't eat lunch until I'm home. They're such small gestures but they show he really cares and mean so much to me.

disneylandparis,ffucjrl,t3_ev9tey,1580239109.0,When we stayed in Santa Fe the security was pretty tight on the gates when we first drove in but I'm presuming you can visit other hotels as they all have unique restaurants/bars/shops. You could probably hop on one of the shuttle buses to the hotel for a quick look and it would be fine.
AskWomen,fel9vkf,t3_epiz4a,1579217238.0,"My bf sits with his knees pulled tightly to his chest all the time. Even when he's eating he'll balance the plate on his knees and eat like that. Makes him look like a gremlin. 

He also has a weird aversion to knives. Unless he absolutely has to he won't use them and will just use a fork."

disneylandparis,fck2red,t3_eh9kmz,1577714844.0,"When I went in June we had one meal a day in the evening and took a bunch of snacks. Chez Remy was my absolute favourite but is very expensive. We also ate at the Rainforest CafÃ© in the village which was amazing, Earl of Sandwich and King Ludwig's in the village. For snacks we took things like packets of crisps, fruit, mini cheddars, cereal bars, etc and filled our bottles at the water fountains around the park. We also took croissants for breakfast every morning and bought a couple of snacks like doughnuts in the bakery down Main Street and a tub of popcorn for the parade. We never went hungry and saved a lot of money."
AskReddit,fchvcvs,t3_eh7571,1577654587.0,"One time I found an empty cardboard box in a room and when I properly looked at it realised it was a box of asserted sex toys. I hadn't made the bed yet and was terrified of what I would find in the dirty sheets. Luckily there was nothing there. 

There was also a time when I was told to go into a room and throw away everything in there and was given a mask and rubber gloves beforehand. When I walked in the room was absolutely trashed. There was about 10 empty bottles of wine (a double room the guests had for only one night) and the floor was covered in meat bones and nut shells. Definitely the grossest room I ever had to enter."

I was so nervous meeting them that I kind of ran into Phil and he knocked the cat ears. In my nervous state I basically shouted at him to 'mind me ears' then immediately felt super embarrassed. They were absolutely lovely to meet though. Genuinely really laid-back guys

You generally can't get more FastPasses until this time has passed. So if you have a timeslot of 12:00-12:30 for Big Thunder Mountain, you will not be able to get more until 12:30."

disneylandparis,f0rtvw9,t3_d6c7i5,1568892718.0,A lot of people don't realise that fast passes are free to use for everyone. Make use of them for the busier rides like Big Thunder Mountain and Peter Pan's Flight. They saved us a lot of time when we were there as queue times get super long. Also try to get them earlier on in the day as they tend to run out by mid afternoon. Hope you have an amazing time!

disneylandparis,ezaz3c0,t3_cz8awq,1567810161.0,When I was there in June it absolutely tipped it down one day and we got soaked. It was during the evening and the main park was pretty empty because everyone went over the the shops to avoid the rain. The only ride I can remember being closed was Big Thunder Mountain. As far as I know everything else was open but we stuck to indoor rides so we didn't get even more wet
disneylandparis,ezay0rv,t3_d0llao,1567809528.0,"I went in June and managed to dedicate a day to each park. Even though studios is small there's plenty to do and see and there isn't as much pressure to get everything done! I would definitely recommend Crush's Coaster if you're into rollercoasters. The long queue time is absolutely worth it. 

I was lucky enough to watch the parade twice: once on Main Street and once in the area by Small World where it starts. Around Small World was definitely quieter and it didn't feel as crowded but my bf thought the atmosphere down Main Street was better. I'd recommend getting there 45 minutes-1 hour beforehand. We did this and got a front row view each time which means lots of character interaction!

I would get to the fireworks an hour beforehand AT LEAST. It gets extremely busy, especially during the period before Christmas so the earlier the better if you're aiming for front row. However, you can still get great views from other spots. We managed to get to a spot just behind a fence on a slight hill so we could see over everyone and had a perfect view. 

I don't know how the crowds will be as I've never been during November but I can imagine it'll be very busy due to it being the Christmas season. I would definitely recommend fast passes for rides such as Big Thunder Mountain, Hyperspace Mountain, Buzz and maybe Ratatouille depending on queue times. Single rider is also an option for Ratatouille and Crush's Coaster but we didn't use this as we wanted to ride together. 

If you're staying in a Disney hotel and have extra magic time then I would definitely try and use this time to meet characters. The queues get pretty long, especially for characters such as Mickey and Minnie. We were able to meet Donald during extra magic time and only waited for about twenty minutes. If you don't have extra magic time then make sure to get to the area a character is going to be early as people tend to queue before they've even arrived! There is information on when and where the characters are on the Disneyland Paris app and brochures outside the Town Hall. 

I hope this was helpful and that you have an amazing time! If you need any more advice feel free to PM me! Could talk about this all day"
