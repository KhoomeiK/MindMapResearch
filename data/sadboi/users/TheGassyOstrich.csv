DnD,eyg4n6n,t1_eyg3kmq,1567061356.0,"This also made me think of one of my early sessions. My group got caught stealing something and put in the stockades for the night. I thought by stockades the DM meant those things you put your head and arms in and are on display for all the public to see. I got really pissed and was going to take on the entire city guard by myself. Luckily my group talked me down.  


Point is, if you or someone gets punished in the game don't take it personally. The DM is just acting out the scene and showing you guys the rule of the land you're RPing in. It's likely s/he put you in a situation where arrest/punishment was one of the likelihoods, or possibly even the only ending. Better to take your character's punishment and RP it to the fullest extent, in sickness and health, castles or prisons, so long as your group shall live.   


It's kind of funny to look back now at how mad I got! I guess I got really really into my character. But remember your character is not actually you, and you can walk away at any time if the group are just mean people. DnD people don't seem to be mean. They even play it in prisons!"

DnD,eyg14vc,t3_cwwmme,1567059184.0,"I got lucky and a group of friends I already knew pretty well started up a game. I also started with a few other people who were completely new to the game, along with a few seasoned players. We made mistakes and our GM was patient with us in explaining. All of the newcomers were pretty shy at first, but we settled into it pretty quickly.  


I had been thinking about trying it out long before that, and looked into DnD groups in my area. There was a game shop that hosted DnD most days, and they had groups specifically for newcomers. Maybe if you're not the only newcomer you might feel more comfortable? Also playing a roll that is not going to be like a ""tanking"" role might be best, that way it's not on you to barge in and initiate combat.   


The first role I did was sorcerer. Pretty good starter. Next was cleric, but they get a TON of spells and I was in way over my head, but learned real quick. The cleric I kind of modeled as myself as far as personality, alignment, traits, flaws, etc. Knowing yourself well helps :D  


You'll get to know your character a lot and understand the game better when you make your first character. The DM can help you pick out spells and/or mention any spells you've already chosen that might not be super useful. You'll also need to roll for your stats, so you'll be doing that at the first session or first contact. That's kind of a good ice breaker. And everyone can tell their backstories if they wish and/or the DM allows it.  


My third character I modeled as my 20 year old self (I'm 37 now). A fighter and tank like character. Far less bitter and more optimistic (lawful good, annoyingly so), but still me. It was kind of fun to play a younger version of myself, and of course I got to exaggerate it a bit.  


One good thing is if you're feeling uncomfortable or even having a bad day, others can always take lead. If no one does DM can prompt them. They also usually have a few ideas in mind for what the session will be. My DMs both kind of rotate between players to give them a chance to take the lead on something (for example one of my characters was a former sailor and when we needed into on something I went and asked old sailor friends at the docks).   


If you're having a shit day you can always let the DM know and they can compensate and/or pursue a different path in the campaign for that day. They want you guys to have fun an succeed, but also make things a challenge. Not so much of a challenge you give up.  


So basically find a DM that seems like s/he is friendly and helpful, answers your questions patiently. Allow yourself time to settle in, and then thrive."

I have been fortunate in my life to discover a support group for Bipolar individuals. It met in person at a hospital in the city I used to live in. The group allowed everyone to come in, including support people, and anyone who had Bipolar or suspected they might.

Many came in with a Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis they thought was really bipolar, and vice versa.

Many were sexual abuse and/or sexual assault survivors.

Some were sexual abuse and/or sexual assault perpetrators. I was scared of them at first, but now they are some of my favorite people.

Many were also in other groups like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) and NA (Narcotics Anonymous).

Our favorite people were the support people that came in and asked for advice. Some of them were also bipolar, or had bipolar family members, had family they thought were in denial, and/or had family currently in a rapid stabilization unit at a hospital.

I'm not trying to say abuse against women doesn't happen. It does.

I'm not trying to say women are disbelieved by society, police, laughed at, called names, etc. They are. I can provide a very few personal stories of this if anyone so desires.

I'm not even going to draw the parallels between male and female survivors, because you can do that yourself.

I will also not talk about male victims of rape experienced by soldiers in Afghanistan. That's an entirely other story.

&#x200B;

**This story is about a male victim of DV.**

I had a neighbor recently who was assaulted by his girlfriend. They were both drunk. He's a big athletic-looking white guy, so the police arrested him. We'll call him Frank.

I met Frank because he was a smoker, and I was a smoker. Frank and my other neighbor, we'll all him Louis, had gotten to know each other a bit before I met them both at the smoker's table.

Frank and his girlfriend were already banned from another property nearby. The manager of the property we live at said as long as there were no problems it was fine if they stayed.

There were problems.

Frank got arrested for DV, as I just said. He told me he was 50 years old and had never been arrested for anything in his life, never homeless. ""Don't date Italian women,"" he advised me. I advised him not to feed the ducks and fish in the nearby lake bread, because it wasn't good for him.

Frank ended up in rehab for 24 hours, trying to dry out, as a result of the most recent arrest. After he was released, he came back but started drinking right away again. It happens.

Next time I saw him he said he was on the streets. Police and ambulance kept coming because he was just sleeping on the grass wherever he felt like it. He was no longer feeding the ducks bread. I wasn't sure what to say he should be feeding them, but later reflected I had taken away his only method of communing with nature. Oops. I advised him to ask the police or EMS (ambulance) if they could take him to a shelter next time that happened.

The last time I saw Frank he said, ""It's going to be tonight."" What was? I asked. ""I'm going to get arrested again."" As it turns out, Frank's girlfriend's sister was staying over. She really knew how to ""push his buttons.""

Don't do that, I said. Have a plan to remove yourself from the situation.

Frank was arrested again, and both him and his girlfriend were banned from the property.

Louis, our mutual neighbor I had mentioned before, allowed Frank to store his stuff in his apartment until he could get it. He was in rehab for over two weeks.

While he was there, I started assembling a ""GO"" bag for him. From one domestic abuse survivor to another. I also have a letter typed out. It started ""Dear Frank: I believe you.""

I never got the chance to give the bag to Frank, because he came when I was not home to get his stuff from Louis' place. I had asked Louis to let me know when he was there, but I guess Louis didn't want me in contact with him. ""He has a new girl--Anne.""

I still have the ""GO"" bag.

Holding onto it in case Frank needs it still.

I have been thinking about posting it on one or a few of the reddit groups I'm on, to to get feedback and possibly make it gender-neutral. Also I'd like feedback on how to make the letter possibly gender neutral and/or more appropriate to the whole country or world, but have hesitated to post it because I've caught a lot of flack for posting things I thought were perfectly reasonable. They're mostly 90% upvoted, when I post them on reddit--FB and Discord don't have that feature, but all it takes is one nasty comment to make me go back and hide in my cave. I've also discovered that ""separation of church and state"" is a luxury that almost nobody for 99.99% of the world and time actually enjoys.

What do you guys think? Would you be interested in knowing the contents of the GO bag?

I never did get a chance to tell Frank what he should be feeding the ducks instead..."

Just that it's usually best to keep women and children in women's shelters and men and children in men's shelters for the most part.

Search through government records. Don't use Ancestry.com. Use your actual government's websites. It may cost money, but they will usually let you look through bring-and-mortar archives for free. (Guessing this is similar to US but not sure) Reach out on your social networks.   


Wiki Louis Riel.  ""Riel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals  as a dangerous half-insane religious fanatic and rebel against the Canadian nation, or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his  Francophone people from the unfair encroachments of an Anglophone national government.""  


If you don't use the scholarships who will? Let them (the government) bleed (money) for you. When you say applying for Citizenship I'm assuming you mean to the Métis Nation? That's a great start. Ask them what you should do.  


People will judge you from both sides: always and early and often. Know yourself.   


Happy re-birthday!"

* Don't take drugs unless you know you will fall asleep.
* Avoid caffeine and other stimulants (light, sound, reddit) for hours before bedtime.
* Set your display for Night Time in Windows (it's on a timer).
* Use a dimming light. If you can't afford one, a ceiling light, lamp, reading lamp, night light combo works. Turn them off gradually. Make sure at least the night light is soft white light.
* Soft, contoured earplugs. Buy in bulk.
* Blackout curtains
* Sleep mask
* Mouth guard if you grind your teeth
* Sleep apnea mask if you have sleep apnea 
* Make a sleep playlist. I did this for many years. The first thing on the list was ""Ave Maria."" Now I get sleepy whenever I hear that song.
* Invest in an app like Calm if you have the $$
* Read a boring book. Or, read an interesting book, then a boring book.
* Read my math teacher's teaching philosophy handout. (She told us to read it if we were having trouble falling asleep one night)
* Get a cat or dog that you can pet to fall asleep. They may kick you in the face, knead your hair, hunt your toes for sport, and/or sleep on top of you so this is a double edged sword.
* Small amount of alcohol if it doesn't interfere with your meds (ask a doctor--red win maybe?)

bipolar,ewl4f8j,t3_cosj48,1565505431.0,"Do anti-nausea meds help you at all?  


I got anxiety and migraines when I was a kid. The things that helped most were midrin (a blood pressure medicine, even though my blood pressure was always on the low end of normal) and an anti-nausea med I can't remember the name of.   


I go to a chiropractor regularly and rarely get migraines now, but beware they can be costly, not all insurance pays for them, and once you start going you will likely need to go the rest of your life or your symptoms will return. Also, find a place you can just walk in to. If your dr says ""two weeks"" but your symptoms return after ten days and he or she doesn't want to see you, fire him or her. If dr says ""once a week"" but you feel fine for a month, don't waste your money. Find a new doctor. Listen to your body.  


Dramamine is the only OTC nausea med I know of, but it might be worth a try.  


On that note, mood stabilizers are the only thing that have worked for me consistently past age 25 or so. I take an SSRI and an anxiety med (Gabapentin). The SSRI makes my mania worse, and the Gabapentin gives me heartburn, but I need them for the Fibromyalgia and Lupus pain anyway. 

I think I might have something on the autism spectrum, but I was diagnosed at age 10 with major depression to start with (bipolar was later ""manic depression"") so it's impossible to know now and I can't go off my meds long enough to get a ""clean"" diagnosis. I also have hypertension now so I take a blood pressure med daily and I have another to use PRN for anxiety but it's actually a blood pressure med. It takes about an hour to work which is good for me, because I had a doctor put me on Xanax and Ambien daily and that was just awful. (Slow-working meds are less addictive)   


Oh well.

Try stuff out and do your research. Keep looking for new doctors until you find one you like and will respect your opinion. If you're 18 your doctor can't talk to your mom without your permission. You can revoke that permission at any time. If you're on your parent's healthcare call the insurance company and ask if you can switch doctors and maybe even if they cover chiropractic.  


Also, yes, move out ASAP if you can.  


Good luck!!"
