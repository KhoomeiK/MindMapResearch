But maybe look into Intellibed, they use the same material, and are somewhat better in my experience from testing them out at their shop. I've only tried purple 1 and 3 thu because mattress firm is dum dum
They are quite a bit more expensive thu but way higher quality and better return policy. If you aren't up for a more expensive bed then purple is probably better than a memory foam mattress if you've tested it out and like it, I just wanted to notify you of another bed company that uses the same material and I think is the original company if I'm not wrong"

I also tried out Intellibed and seem to like it a bit better. I love the material both of them use. If I could imagine what purple 2 would feel like from the 2 that I've tried, I think I would like it

Number one would be assignment supplement or or just eating more meats or whatever with Simon this will Simon really is kind of food that cause of constipation so you might want to do one of those two


number three would be not enough at this might work for some people this might not it just kind of depends on the person
