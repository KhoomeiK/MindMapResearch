depression,fk4vjki,t3_ffy952,1583868424.0,"I have done all the things you are supposed to do. Exercise, eat healthy, stay hydrated, get sleep, focus on the positives, think about what you’re grateful for, go to therapy, journal...the list goes on. And though I feel better, I am still depressed. I can still feel my chest aching with sadness. I’m still exhausted from just existing. Even when I have good days/weeks and everything goes right, I still have that lingering sadness that’s fighting to grow. Depression won’t budge. 

I can choose to make things a little better by doing all the “right things”, but it won’t cure my depression.

Edit: my therapist agrees, so there’s that"
OCD,fjyaykl,t3_ffge44,1583693187.0,"You just described my life. It’s not as bad as it used to be, but I still do a lot of avoidance. I’m so careful all the time because I’m worried I’ll do something “bad” and feel guilty."
OCD,fjszf2s,t1_fjp7t8j,1583601823.0,I’m sorry to hear that. OCD is such an awful experience.
OCD,fjszbjf,t1_fjqyogk,1583601792.0,"Thank you. That’s really insightful :) Luckily, I have an amazing therapist. I’m moving soon, though, so I’m on my own then, but I’ll try to use some of this."

OCD,fjobhle,t3_fe90a2,1583524426.0,"me: *expresses to someone that they have hurt my feelings*

me, internally: you’re manipulating them. you’re a complete sociopath and a horrible person."
mentalhealth,ffwhfm3,t1_ffwgpco,1580301123.0,"Thanks. I have considered Vitamin D deficiency, but I take the recommended supplements. It’s probably the eating/exercise/lack of sleep/lack of hydration combo, and though I logically know this, I’m struggling to listen to my body’s needs. But I’ll speak to my therapist about these things. Thanks, again. The hugs are appreciated :)"
