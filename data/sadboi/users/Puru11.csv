I go to work, go home, and go grocery shopping once a week or two (been trying to stretch it as long as I can).

However, in some places there are some silly restrictions. I live in the mountains, and our state closed waterways, hiking trails, and banned fishing and hunting last week. For a lot of people hunting and fishing is food not sport. Kayaking and hiking are oftentimes solo activities, and it's not difficult to maintain social distance from others on the trail or water. It seems ridiculous to me to shut that down, and in recent days our state reopened most of those activities for us thankfully. However, they've kept some hiking trails closed, which I can understand, because some of them are very busy trails (one near my house usually has cars parked down the sides of the road because the lot is full on any given day of the week). 

The protesters are morons, but some places are getting a bit carried away with what they consider to be ""social settings""."
