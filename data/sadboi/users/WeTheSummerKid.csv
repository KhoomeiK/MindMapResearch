&nbsp;

Annoyance (and its larger brother, frustration) is another existential emotion (much like happiness, sadness, and, most notably, anxiety: often manifesting in the ""fear of missing out""). 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Existentialism is what turns privation (not just money but also experiences, health, weaknesses) into wealth. Existentialism is the universal key to the prison of hellish existence (don't end your life: one must imagine Sisyphus happy; Sisyphus was condemned to roll a rock to the top of a mountain only for the rock to fall down again, Sisyphus must then roll that rock upon the mountain ad infinitum).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

When I was young (single digit years), reading about the end of the universe gave me existential anxiety about missing out on existence itself. Science marched on, and when I figured out I was made of atoms and that even the end of the universe itself may end in 10^10^10^56 years (or any other time unit such as nanoseconds or red dwarf lifespans), I became existentially reassured.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

We are both simultaneously fascinated with the unknown, and afraid of it. We want to go into space, but many of us are afraid of going into space. Perhaps the first emotion we felt growing up (read: hominids) is neuroticism: our anxiety to protect against predators, our aggressiveness to gather food, and so on and so forth.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Animal Crossing: New Horizons, right now, fills a void (to an extent), or, shrinks the void. Perhaps in the near future, the Experience Machine (think The Matrix, but in a good way) will be built: existing technologies (our knowledge of cranial nerves, the limitations of human sensory experience, our ability to simulate events) make it practical: not now, but maybe soon.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I have ADHD-Inattentive, Aspergers, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and an iatrogenic benzodiazepine dependence to Clonazepam. In video games, I am not limited by social skills, nor am I limited by my inattention. It stands to reason I shall not be disabled by my limitations in simulated reality. With the experience machine, I shall finally live a life congruent to my desires (remember: we often devour fiction to fill a void; and there's such a thing as the ""social surrogacy hypothesis"").

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I can only hope. That hope can calm me down on a bad day.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

This is made possible by: Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Camus, Sartre and de Beauvoir, Nietzsche, and, all the other existentialist philosophers. Other things that help in the writing of this include Wikipedia, Isaac Arthur (YouTube channel), PBS Space Time, Kurzgesagt, among others."
