It is time to focus on the real problems we face both as countries and as human beings. Not try to create a boogeyman to scare us and forget the real issues. Or try to make us fight each other."

Remember that you are not alone in your journey. We all are together in it. Our stories may be different but many of our sufferings are the same. Also remember that many myths and misinformations about mental illness still needs to be debunked for the lay man. Take care."
