In 95% of the cases the questions you're asking yourself about how and why you did something and how people reacted to it are unnecessary. No one cares about the way you stuttered in the middle of presentation, relax and go with the flow. I also have this habit of saying ""That's actually exactly what I wanted to do"" with a wide grin on my face every time I do something seemingly embarrassing."

AskReddit,fggbc88,t3_ey5xzc,1580758258.0,"So around Christmas break, I started getting closer with this girl from my class that I hadn't really known that much even though we've been sitting next to each other for two years now. It amazes me how we can have healthy discussions and, though our opinions are mostly similar, can agree to disagree or meet in the middle.

Anyways, a week back we were texting and she was out with friends, already tipsy by 10 pm. By midnight we started having one of those meaningful super deep conversations where you accidentally spill all the beans to someone. At one point, she just texts me: ""I wish I had a soul as colorful and full of life as yours"". Of course, being half-drunk she adds a few more compliments but that one's actually stuck with me the longest. I remember it on gloomy days and smile to myself, and I can't believe anyone would ever think of me like that, let alone tell me so bluntly."

Each time they'd try to talk me out of it, believed my empty promises (seriously, how can you believe a promise like ""don't do that anymore because of our feelings), yelled then never mentioned it again, like ever.

Felicia, I make up new people in randomest of situations as a coping mechanism in order to escape people like you. What even makes you think I would deliberately want to insert your egoistic, attention-seeking self in one of my worlds? That's like inviting yourself to someone's house when you've known them for two weeks: extremely rude and illogical!"
