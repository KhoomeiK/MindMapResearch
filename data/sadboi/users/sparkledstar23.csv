In my opinion, my self esteem gets better when I'm not so depressed and down on myself. My anxiety nearly vanishes with antidepressants (Effexor, an SNRI, helped more than any SSRI I've been on though). With lessened depression I feel less of an urge to hurt myself, but the thoughts are still there on my rough days. My irritability gets a lot better and I can handle more things that would have otherwise ruined my day/ set me off. Similar with mood swings, the medication(s) help level out my highs and lows, to an extent, although when I was on a very high dose I felt ""numb"" and emotionless. So it's kind of a trade off, depending. My suicidal thoughts vanished once I started to feel better."

If you are too groggy after taking the trazadone you could ask you doc about lowering the dose or switching to a different sleeping aid. I have tried tons and seroquel worked wonders!! 

I would 100% make an appointment with your prescriber and you can leave out the suicidal ideation if you don't think you will actually go through with it (I never mention suicide for fear of being admitted as well).

I have read that fish oil and omega 3s can help a ton with the fogginess and general discomfort that comes with withdrawing from antidepressants. My mother took CBD oil religiously and she said it worked wonders. I know you said you wanted to stop antidepressants all together, but if you are open to it, your prescriber may be able to prescribe you a very low dose antidepressant to help with the withdrawals that you can easily quit after you are off of the Effexor.

I was sleeping less than 30 minutes a night for weeks on end, eating less than 500 calories a day, leaving the house every 4-5 days, etc.

I finally dragged myself to a psychiatrist and she immediately diagnosed me with bipolar I and prescribed me a mood stabilizer. I believe her original thought was that I was having a mixed episode, due to the lack of sleep which is not common for extremely depressed/ suicidal patients. Over the course of 5 months I was upped to the max dose of that mood stabilizer and went through 8 different sleeping medications (none of which worked except for one that made hallucinate) until I eventually landed in an inpatient facility, days away from probably ending my life.

They were shocked and confused as to why my psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar and immediately took me off the mood stabilizer and put me on a new antidepressant and found 2 sleeping aids that worked for me. I was officially diagnosed with MDD and generalized anxiety by 3 different doctors there, and 2 psychiatrists since. I was feeling better within days. 

Long story short, my psychiatrist jumped to conclusion and failed to recognize that her methods were not effective at all. Needless to say I do not go to her anymore. Still struggling, but I'm 100 times better than I was 6 months ago."
