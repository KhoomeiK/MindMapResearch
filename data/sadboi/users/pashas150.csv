depression_help,fil53ee,t3_f88lbw,1582493827.0,"Really sorry to hear you’re struggling.  I’m a 48male from England, depression can happen to anybody of any age or sex so don’t worry about that. I’ve had various different medications and various different types of counselling.  Some of the counselling was great and some not so good but don’t count the therapy out because sometimes it takes a while before you find the person that really gets how you feel and then you can really talk to them. As for medication again it can really make a difference.  You say you’re a bad person, I’m sure you’re not, it’s just how you feel.  I feel like that a lot of the time as well, it’s just another thing you have to work on.  I would say yes definitely see your GP, they are there to help and from my experience they were very understanding. Really hope it goes well for you..."

depression_help,fgmnn4p,t3_eyznal,1580928285.0,"I know this situation plus I was drinking quite a bit as well, it’s really difficult, I kept thinking sooner or later I’ll reach a bottom point where I feel there is no way to go but up.  Unfortunately the less I did the less I wanted to do.  I’ve started to do little things around the house, like organise the bookshelves, clear the cupboards and clean all the garden tools.  Meaningless jobs really but it does help to get the endorphins flowing and improve mood a little bit.  Maybe you could choose something, doesn’t have to be big or challenging just something you can look at afterwards with a sense of achievement, it might help.  Really hope things improve for you, all the best and take good care of yourself."
depression_help,fgi7iqf,t3_eye7nq,1580809663.0,Things are obviously impossible for you right now  and I am so sorry to hear that.  As you feel at the moment just getting through each day is a huge triumph and give yourself a huge pat on the back on the back for that.  Just keep going I’m really rooting for you and take the very best care of yourself.
depression_help,fg7u4xb,t3_ewvkcq,1580601518.0,"I can’t understand the attitude of that person in your group at all, they were in the wrong to say what they did.  I attended some group counselling and the very first thing we were told was that there was to be no judgment of anyone else in the group at all and that we were all there to be supportive of one another which we were. You have been very brave to go to these sessions, nobody wants to be depressed and then somebody in your group challenges you like that which is unhelpful. When you feel depressed you do tend to feel very sensitive and every criticism cuts you to the bone, that’s the whole point of these groups,  they’re supposed to be a safe place where everybody can say anything without judgement.  You’re doing great going to the sessions I’d say that was a great step forwards.  I wish you the very best for the future."
depression_help,fg4hom1,t3_ewlc5d,1580503488.0,That’s great to hear hope it continues for you.
depression_help,ffyc8af,t3_evtp6x,1580342971.0,"Wow what an amazing analogy, that so how I feel.  Right now I’m trying to fix leaks in my house but as soon as I fix one leak another one appears, meanwhile everyone else seems to be building state of the art extensions.  I hope you’re having more luck with your house renovations.  All the best to you and take good care of yourself."
depression_help,ffo4ssb,t3_eu7h8f,1580074171.0,"I’m glad you had the courage to post this, it was very brave of you.  You really have had a huge amount to deal with in your life and I have the utmost respect for you.  Some of the challenges you have had to deal with would have broken me instantly like a fragile vase.  Reading some of the things you have been through you are obviously a very capable and resilient person, however everybody has their breaking point and it sounds like you have reached yours.  I would like you to recognise some of the huge achievements in your life though, surviving a difficult childhood, leaving home for a big city and securing a job, providing a home for your girlfriend and child and serving your country bravely in the military.  I’m just so sorry you don’t have some support now because you deserve it.  I know you say you are worried about the neighbours but you are obviously a good person and just as good as them so try and ignore them.  They will either understand you are having a tough time or if they don’t they are the one’s with the problem not you.  I wish you all the best as I’m sure many others do.  You can do this, one step at a time.  Look after yourself friend."

depression_help,ffbwkzb,t3_esqrnt,1579785147.0,"Just hang in there buddy, life can be such a bitch sometimes and you don’t know where to turn, who to talk to or what to do.  There’s lots of support here for you,  I for one wish the very best for you.  Never really know what to say but you put your message out there and l’m sure there are lots of people listening like me who want things to improve for you.  Take care and look after yourself and really hope tomorrow brings better things for you."
depression_help,ffabdwu,t3_esgiy2,1579731590.0,"I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way.  A couple of the things you said resonate strongly with me.  I feel constantly at odds with myself,  I can’t make any sense of it either, I’ve received some therapy and I have been doing a bit better until a couple of days ago but I’m not feeling good again.  I don’t know what the problem is, I feel sick to the stomach all the time, fidgety and talking to people is a real problem.  I’m too busy having a massive argument with myself to be able to engage in polite conversation.  I’ve always been pretty quiet but with people I know I used to love the friendly banter, but now I don’t know who I am anymore, I just feel weird and uncomfortable all the time.  There is no calm or stability in my mind.  Here I am moaning away when you probably were hoping for some helpful advice.  The only thing I can say is just keep working at it because I’m sure you’re a good person and hopefully you will get back to your old self.  These feelings can’t last forever that’s what I tell myself.   Good luck and take good care of yourself."
depression_help,fey7p6m,t3_eqp1vj,1579441867.0,"Yes I can relate to that and I won’t try and tell you that I understand because everybody has their own individual challenges that no one else can relate to.
I’ve been out of work now for about 18 months now, I was working as a builders labourer for about 4 years but I couldn’t even cope with that. A lot of the guys I worked with were big strong rugby player types and I am neither strong nor particularly clever. Every day I was constantly worried that I would drive the dumper into a hole or the new brickwork or that I had dug the trench in the wrong place or was there the correct fall on  the sewer pipes. I finally cracked and quit.  Now I don’t feel capable of doing any job.  I spent a few months barely leaving the house just drinking all day to try and shut the whole world out.
I attended some counselling courses and at the time I didn’t feel they were much help but in fact I think some of the information might have lodged itself into my tiny mind.  A couple of the things that I think are universal are ‘compare and despair’ and ‘take some steps’ For instance in my case constantly comparing myself to how capable other people are just doesn’t help and makes me feel hopeless and demotivated. We are all individuals and have our own unique qualities which we should feel good about.  With regard to taking small steps if you are really struggling you’re not suddenly going become this incredibly amazing productive person tomorrow.  Today might be just about getting out of bed, doing the washing, paying some bills, going down to the shops and if you’ve done those things you can feel good about them and maybe do a bit more tomorrow.  If tomorrow is a shit day, don’t worry you can reset the following day and try and keep chipping away at things little by little. This is what I’m trying to work on at present,
Sorry for the huge ramble, l am really sorry that you are struggling and I wish you the very best for the future, take care."
depression,fb93s5a,t3_e9hksr,1576628628.0,"Yes I have this feeling as well and it is terrible.  I want friends and family to be well and move forward with success in their life, but when I hear how they have got married and they’re doing this and that it makes me feel bitter and twisted.  I don’t want to feel like this because I know it is wrong and I fight this battle inside my head to not be jealous and be happy for them.  Then because I am having these feelings it makes me feel even worse about myself.  I think maybe everyone feels like this to a degree but if you feel down and your self confidence is rock bottom these feelings can multiply.  I guess the thing is to get something going for yourself however small so you can feel better about yourself and then it is easier to feel positive emotions about other people’s progress.  However this as far as my own position is concerned is easier said then done but I guess I must just keep trying somehow."
depression,fb90sez,t3_e2gnrw,1576626477.0,"Yep, when I don’t feel as though I can deal with stuff I try and go to sleep or drink until I feel like going to sleep."

depression,fa8p5zo,t3_e7qvet,1575851409.0,"God I’m so sorry that your pain is so bad and you are struggling so much.  It is so good that you posted here to let everyone know of your feelings.   I know that probably at the moment nothing that anyone says will help but please just keep going, l am sending loving thoughts to you.  There must have been a time in your life when you were happy and didn’t feel like this and you have to believe that somehow you can find your way back to that place because nobody deserves to feel the way you do at the moment.  There is only one person like you in the whole world which makes you special and unique."
