They're really fond of sticking terrified kids back with their parents against their will. I know there are some around I just don't know how easy it'd be to find em. 

CAS forced me to go back to my mom after her probation and it broke me in so many ways. It's never okay to do that and I hate that CAS workers were my biggest gaslighters. Goodluck with your paper, the world needs to understand that blood isn't always family and that some people just don't deserve to be parents."
raisedbynarcissists,fb8wkmr,t3_eby9e8,1576623545.0,"This is a really complex topic and issue. Like, it really confuses me that even after my mom was arrested for child abuse and attempted murder (she tried to kill me), and refused to continue any sort of treatment for her ASPD after probation, that she was both allowed to have her children back after probation AND pop out another kid. To me her having a baby or any kids was a dangerous and bad thing to happen, but she's already proven to be abusive so I have different opinions for her than I would for new parents.

I definitely think parenting classes should be mandatory for new parents, and maybe yearly check-ins with kids would be good, but I don't think like. a test from the government would be the best thing for new parents,, that could go very wrong very fast and would be a violation of your body. I do think that when a parent is shown to be violent, neglectful, or cruel towards children that they should be way more strict about letting kids back into their lives or having more, and an actual test would maybe be a good step in that process. 

My CAS worker always said that her main concern would always be keeping families together. It was never ""do you feel safe visiting your mom?"" ""do you feel ready to live with your mom again?"" ""Is your PTSD too severe to live with the woman who tried to kill you?"" it was ALWAYS ""We need to keep families together"". Some people shouldn't be families and I think the system is way too corrupt that way and also focuses way too much on just physical abuse. 

That's kinda my thoughts on this but it really is a difficult subject. If we had a law like that in place it would be really easy for the government to say ""people who have any sort of mental illness can't reproduce"", ""Anyone with a criminal record can't be a parent"" or implement rules on only having a certain amount of children and such, which as we've seen is very bad and scary. One law controlling reproductive rights of the general population will lead to more."

This may sound obviously wrong, so I'm just gonna explain that CAS in my home county are very known for gaslighting. After my moms probation (arrested for child abuse and attempting to kill me) she got me back and continued to be very neglectful and emotionally abusive. 

CAS told me she was better, I was selfish for not being happy my mom didn't hit me anymore, that threats aren't the same as actions, ect. so I still struggle understanding what things she did were emotional abuse.

It made me feel so loved, which I never felt from anyone else. She was a total mama kitty and always cuddled with me when I was sad or sick. She was so so caring and graceful and just there for me.

I miss her so much and I still feel so bad about her death, I know her blood is partially on my hands and it breaks my heart. Cats will always be in my heart and way easier to connect with and understand than people.

The best thing you can do is make sure you become homeless in a city with lots of resources, and search them about before you become homeless.

Get connected with a health clinic that caters to the homeless, places that give free meals and clothes(usually there r more than 1 places that serve meals, it's nice to have options), social workers, mental health workers, a place that does free laundry, employment help, ect. Find as many supports as possible and use them all, be open to letting them help you. Trust can be hard but when you're homeless you need all the support you can get.

Stay away from street drugs. I managed to stay clean the entire time I was homeless, but I did pick up smoking which sucks. Smoking's atleast better than getting heroin from some sketchy homeless guy though, trust me. That shit's way more likely to get you killed fast. (If you are going to be using, try to see if there's a clinic near you that provides free kits. Take serious precautions incase of OD)

Find a body sized piece of cardboard to sleep on if you ever get stuck sleeping on cement. It'll keep you warmer. Also getting glove warmers and one of those silver heat blankets that fold up really small are great. There may be a place in your city that'll provide you with that stuff.

always do feeding from either sides of the door, moving feeding slowly closer to the door every day. if you have a baby gate, once they're right by the door eating have one put up w a blanket over and restart feeding while slowly lifting blanket. if you dont have a gate, slowly open the door farther over time but make sure they dont cross territories yet. you have to be careful and patient with opening the door, wouldn't suggest if physical aggression is an issue.

once you've gotten the door open fully with them eating close and not having a negative reaction to eachother, start doing playtime with both of them at once. in my experience this usually works with introducing new cats and cats that started having problems. its all about positive scent association. cats getting separated, especially due to sickness, can shatter that positive association and it needs to be carefully rebuilt. cats often dont do well at mending relationships by just letting them figure things out for themselves. 

also, adding more litter boxes and shelving/trees can be a great help once theyre both back with full access to your home. its easier to share territory, boosts confidence, and litterboxes are big social areas and they share allot of scent there, so the more the better"

Depending on your area you could qualify for learning disability supports, if you feel comfortable sharing your diagnosis with the school admin since you'd need a letter from your psychiatrist/doctor stating diagnosis and request for supports.

If I return to school I'll have that in place and it would carry out into college. For me I get copies of every note, extra time on all tests assignments and exams, can have a one on one teacher with me in classes, ect. I'm sure it's different everywhere, but that just gives you an idea on what a school decided was appropriate for someone personally based on their learning struggles caused by schizophrenia.

Mental illness can sometimes make it extremely hard to learn at the same pace/in a similar way as your classmates, and accommodations really should be in place. I'd highly suggest looking into seeing if those sorts of options are available and if they aren't then maybe getting someone who's in your corner to fight for that to change."
