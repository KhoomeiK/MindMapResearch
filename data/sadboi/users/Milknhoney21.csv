2. Lows - boredom makes me bake so i am back to making cakes and cookies but tracking and trying to portion control. Also did not exercise bc my IBS has been crazy bad this week

3. What I learned - I need to drink more water. Sometimes I snack from boredom or thirst and not hunger 

4. Next week i am going to do more 18:6 fasts and calorie count"

Stats: 5’0
CW:125   GW:105-110
I will likely not lose all this in one month so for the month of May I’d like to just lose 5 pounds even. 

Goal:
To feel good in my own body again

IF period: aiming for 16-8. Will try to go back using zero app. 

Workouts;
None right now. Planning to do YouTube workouts maybe. 

Changes in food:
Reduce sugar and fried food. Only drink water and black tea or coffee. Count calories through MyFitnessPal and reduce snacking. 

Good luck guys!"

I am an introvert but like to be social sometimes so when this started I was miserable being home all the time with no outside activities or seeing my friends and do workers. I have now been inside for 6 weeks I think and I am starting to get used to my new routine. I love sleeping in later and just waking up and work is there. No waking up super early and commuting 1.5 hours on a crowded train. I love getting off work and being already home. I eat only home cooked meals and have time to cook so I’m eating better and saving money. I have more time for other hobbies like reading, painting, etc. I am so ready for this virus to be over but I am also super used to the work from home routine now and considering finding a job that lets me work remotely most of the time."

AskMen,fc4r6ci,t1_fc4mapt,1577425421.0,Exactly this. But also even with the right people sometimes you get exhausted from being too social and need to recharge. So 1. You need to find better people or friends to socialize with and the conversation won’t drain you. And 2. Even with better conversations and people you will get drained sometimes and it’s ok to recharge alone for a bit

I have a small Christmas tree and it looks so cozy lit up. If I’m sad, I bake - cookies or pound cakes. I make joy chocolate and sit by my tiny tree and watch Christmas movies by myself.

MuslimMarriage,f7jnfql,t3_dwhnin,1573781764.0,I am not the most religious person so I don’t have an answer that you might like. My fiancé who I am planning to marry ...I knew when I figured out he is my best friend and he feels like home to me. The feeling of being out all day and then coming home? That’s how I feel when I talk to him. He gets me and we laugh together and talk about everything including gross body functions. He is literally my best friend and I can’t wait to marry my best friend and come home to him everyday. Aso I hate talking on the phone but talked to him for 4 hours one day and didn’t even notice...
MuslimMarriage,f7jn3n2,t3_dwhws0,1573781529.0,I’ve felt this exact same way for the last few years. None of the apps worked. When I liked guys they ghosted or guys that liked me I didn’t feel a connection with. I was ready to give up and live alone forever or just marry someone nice my family found. However I got lucky that my family found someone and we have been talking for a year now and fell in love. Things are still difficult for us and it is not easy being 30 and unmarried but I don’t know what to tell you.  You’re not alone just so you know.

But when you have lesss to lose it’s almost impossible. I’ve tried everything from IF to CICO to just eating one meal a day. It is difficult to be consistent and difficult to see results when you only have about 10 pounds or so to loss 😭

MuslimMarriage,f6ks2zn,t3_dpwerq,1572919334.0,I had this happen but my fiancé called it off the day off because of family issues not because we didn’t love each other. My family had already paid for the hall and food so we had to go and guests came. It was one of the worst moments of my life... to go to my own wedding and have it called it off. I cried a lot and couldn’t look at the decorations or eat anhtning but I had to smile and be strong for all the guests that came and offered sympathies. A lot of people talked trash afterwards from the community. People made up rumors for why it broke off and made up stories. Probably one of the worst days of my life.
