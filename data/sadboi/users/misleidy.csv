depression,fdkvj8g,t3_elqwy9,1578512030.0,"Low self-esteem, lack of self worth, lack of identity, lack of purpose, inability to connect with others, socially awkward, extremely self critical, unable to rely on family, unable to trust others. Self hatred...constant escapism which only prolongs my suffering because I refuse to look at the ugly truth"
mentalillness,fddeil9,t1_fdddpqy,1578308587.0,"Yes! The most important thing is to address the core issue. And definitely be careful to never make it about appearance. You want to try to never make her feel ashamed in any way about herself and her eating problem. Also, even if you become frustrated with her, do not show her you are frustrated. It‚Äôs hard not to sometimes since you care about her and want her to get better. But doing this will make her feel bad. Always make her feel like she can talk to you without feeling ashamed. My own parents failed at this, so I never really talked to them about my emotions when it came to my feelings when I over ate so they couldn‚Äôt understand me enough to help me resolve my problem."
mentalillness,fdde5ty,t1_fddd6ld,1578308080.0,"Definitely address that issue with anxiety. She may not seem anxious sometimes on the outside but could still be on the inside. Figuring out where it‚Äôs coming from, letting her talk to you about her feelings and talking her through them can really help her out. Keep an open communication with her about her feelings and teach her how to manage her anxiety. 

About eating with friends, maybe you can let whoever it is your eating with know privately that you‚Äôre trying to teach her portion control so you would appreciate it if they worked with you on it by not offering more. It‚Äôs important to do this in private so as to not make her feel ashamed for it. The candy bit, just try to cut out down as much as you can and maybe buy candies that don‚Äôt have as much sugar. 

Your daughter is lucky to have parents so concerned with her wellbeing! Im sure your family will be able to find a resolution! üíó"
mentalillness,fddcwrh,t3_ekr19z,1578306234.0,"Ok so I can‚Äôt speak completely for your daughter, but this is actually the issue I had growing up. my issue ended up being related to anxiety and eating as a source of comfort to soothe myself. My parents tried to put boundaries at times but they weren‚Äôt super consistent with it and I would find things to eat anyway. Try to be consistent and strict with the amount of food she eats. As you already do, keep the bad foods out of the house (don‚Äôt hide things either) so she doesn‚Äôt have access to them. Encourage drinking water with meals so she feels fuller when she‚Äôs done. Maybe make meals for her that are the proper portions for her and let her know she isn‚Äôt allowed to eat more than that for that meal. She‚Äôs allowed snacks but only ONE portion of that snack. Basically, try to teach her about and enforce portion control. But do it in a gentle and caring manner. Don‚Äôt stress her out about it because it wont resolve anything. Especially if this could be coming from a place of anxiety. She‚Äôs 9 so you can talk to her and educate her about the consequences of overeating. It‚Äôs really important to fix this problem in her now because when she grows up it‚Äôs going to be a lot harder to fix. I can not stress this enough. You should figure out the core of the problem as to why she may be overeating, it could be she just never learned when to stop so she‚Äôs just used to it now. Or it could be out of anxiousness. Or a combination of both. She could also be bored at home with nothing to do so she seeks out food.

If you buckle down and really teach her to control her portions and figure out the core issue as to why she overeats, the problem may resolve itself soon. she‚Äôs only 9 she will get used to it quickly! The important thing is to make sure you guys fix her unhealthy relationship with food to set her up for a healthy and happy future."
mentalillness,fddccdq,t3_eknuv8,1578305387.0,"I have this problem right now. The only time I‚Äôm not in bed is when I‚Äôm in school or out once in a blue moon. Try to plan something exciting for you to do in the mornings that you like, or if you don‚Äôt like anything, something new that you want to try. Like yoga or a new recipe you think will taste good. You need to try to give yourself a good enough reason to get out of bed. Routine also does help, when you feel you have a responsibility you can‚Äôt avoid or are already used to doing so you can‚Äôt go without doing it. Like giving your dog a walk so they can go to the bathroom outside or something in the mornings. Now the next issue is staying out of bed and not curling back in when you‚Äôre done haha. Not bringing your laptop or phone with you to bed can make you get bored of laying down and eventually you feel like getting up. Maybe you‚Äôll just sit in a chair all day on your phone but at least you‚Äôre not in bed."
depression,fd7qdci,t3_ejsoej,1578208453.0,"My parents have barely talked to me about my depression even though they‚Äôve seen me laying miserably in my room for the past 3 years. They don‚Äôt know how to handle my situation. My dad‚Äôs tried to talk to me seriously somewhat maybe three times in these 3 years. My mom never talks to me about it and only let‚Äôs out her frustrations about me, onto me. Making me feel worse. I found out recently that some fortuneteller that my parents believe in said I was in danger of killing myself. That was 3 years ago. It really made me even more depressed to find out this is how they handle it when they think their daughter might kill herself lol."
