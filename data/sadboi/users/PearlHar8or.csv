I had been practicing my singing for about a month to try out for the school musical and I was kinda excited because I'd never done anything like that before and it was gonna be a new experience. Anyway the day of my audition he came up to me at school and told me that his mom didnt want to pick him up and wanted to see if I could walk with him home (he lives about 2-3 away from school and in the other direction of my apartment) I really wanted to do my audition but Nathan doesnt usually come to me about these things and he keeps to himself when things are going on at home. So I made a choice, I skipped my auditon and walked with him to his house after school. On the way to his place I decided maybe I should get him some food that usually cheers me up when I'm sad. (Some more context I had about 50 bucks saved up because there was this girl I was gonna go on a date with and I just ended up spending most of what I had on lunch) So the only food place nearby his house was a KFC and we are both athletes so I said fuck it and just got us a meal for 4 which took a good portion of my cash and I sat with him there until I knew he talked with me about his problems and we ate all of it lol. I talked and ate with him until he went home with a clear mind and I walked him more to his house and then walked back to my house afterwards. Its probably not as kind as some others but sometimes you just need to be a friend and I'm glad my money went to making him feel a little happy."

MensRights,fow3bt3,t3_g9rwev,1588112237.0,You know I really liked Big Jo (Name of the webtoon for those who don't know) But the 2nd season is garbage. The webtoon went from this girl who was overweight and did take crap from anyone but she was unhappy with the way she was. They bring in the main guy Tom who gets her to exercise (by tricking her) and lose weight and she starts enjoying running turning it into a romantic story where the story was telling you with enough time and the right people anyone can do anything. But the 2nd season turned into a LGBT+ community/fat acceptance thing that I can't make heads or tales of and it disappoints me how hard it pushes for the reader to know these things not to mention putting down some social norms which can be unhealthy. Making fun of MRAs was only the start.

The problem is a good portion is solid muscle but I didnt do cardio often when I worked out so itll be tough but just gotta keep working at it. you can bench 315 just keep working at it little by little I believe in you!"

When I first started I could barely do 20s on the bar then again I was 5'9 and 140 pounds at the time. Sports help immensely and funny enough my Buddy jackson can still almost do more than 100 pounds higher than me on bench and puts me to shame in deadlift, but he went to state in wrestling and is 250lbs of complete muscle, before this whole thing went down I was training so that I could do Rugby in college."
