funny,fmzlrz5,t1_fmz5drl,1586524088.0,"I got called quirky growing up, by people who wanted to be nice and wierd by people who wanted to be less nice. I'm 44 now, have purple hair and work on computers and have action figures displayed around my house of the characters I love. Quirky and weird have become my shield and armor. Growing up, being called those names did kinda hurt. Once I embraced the truth of them, they couldn't hurt me anymore. ""You're weird!""  ""Pbbbt. And? We all know this."" One day, not giving a shit about being called quirky will become her superpower."

ChoosingBeggars,ex7zfc4,t3_croxov,1566066762.0,"I had a yard sale once at my parents' house and brought my 2 chihuahua doggos outside for a walk. (It was a really big yard since we lived outside of town.) A lady was talking to me and commented on how cute the dogs were. I said thank you and continued talking to her. She said she needed someone to mow her yard so I offered because I loved any excuse to use the riding lawn mower. She then asked me how much I wanted for my dogs. I told her that they weren't for sale and she just kept saying ""C'mon. Ballpark figure. How much do you want? I have a lot of chihuahuas at home and I like yours.""

I repeated that they weren't for sale several times and thought she finally got it. Over the next two weeks I got so many texts from her asking if my dogs were for sale yet, that I just finally had to block her number."

You can talk about the other parents' bad behavior in a way that doesn't make it seem like you're shitting on the other parent. Telling the kid ""your father(mother) is an asshole because blah, blah, blah"" just makes you seem angry."

AskReddit,ex08ynq,t3_cqnguk,1565907373.0,"My husband and I bought a new to us car last year. He spent quite a bit of time researching online before we went to an actual dealership. Most of them were fine. Then we met the Smoothie Douchebag. 
Dude sauntered out of the office while we're looking at cars drinking a smoothie with one hand and the other hand in his pocket. (Cue Alainis break)
He apologized for drinking the smoothie while we were talking. His boss bought one for everyone and he didn't want it to melt. Totally understandable. I'd do the same in his situation. What he did next earned him the name Smoothie Douchebag.

We proceed to walk around the lot and looked at various cars. Along the way, I realize that SD and my husband are getting further and further ahead of me. I don't hold my husband at fault for this since he was talking to the guy and asking questions. When we stop at each car, both my husband and I are asking questions, but SD only directs his answers to my husband. SD barely looks in my direction and never really acknowleges that I'm there.
We decide we're done looking but SD offers to go back inside and look up some prices for us. We walk back and they get further ahead of me to the point where they are entering the building and I'm still a good 50-75 feet away. SD holds the door open for my husband and walks in without looking back in my direction.

I get to the building and another salesman opens the door. I thank him before heading over to where my husband is sitting and talking to SD (who never looks at me when I sit). Husband says that we've got some thinking to do as they didn't have the car we really wanted to look at. We get up to leave and SD shakes my husband's hand as they walk out. I look at SD and start to offer my hand and tell SD that it was nice to meet him. He puts both his hands in his pocket and fucking nods at me. Doesn't move to open the door or say anything to me in response, just nods and walks away. 

We're driving away and I tell my husband that I don't want to buy a car from this place and why. He apologizes for not saying anything while we were there, but honestly I didn't speak up and say something while it was going on either so I can't blame him.  

A week or so later, we get a follow up call from the SD that we missed. My husband sees this on the caller ID and tells me next time his phone rings from this place, I'm welcome to talk to them myself. A few days later, my husband is at the dentist when his phone rings. I take his phone and step out into the hallway and talk to SD who asks if we're still looking for a car. I tell him, ""Yes, we are, but we won't be buying from your dealership."" He's very surprised and asks why, to which I respond, ""Frankly, it was you and your behavior when we visited."" I then proceed to lay out everything he did that pissed me off. He said, ""I'm sorry. I had no idea there was anything wrong. I thought we had a great rapport."" I said, ""You did...with my husband. You never actually spoke to me and even refused to shake my hand.""

He asked if we'd come back if he gave our account to another salesperson and said, ""We've got a woman salesman here if you'd prefer to talk to her.""

I politely told him no thank you and we'd be going elsewhere. He apologized again and said he had no idea that he was doing anything wrong. I said, ""Well, now that's something for you to be more mindful of in the future.""

I was very happy to get the customer service survey later. :D

TL;DR: Guy selling a car was a misogynistic asshole and I'm happy I got to tell him off."
