iching,fiuk1tm,t1_fiuig57,1582742884.0,"aw i'm about to cry:) you nailed it, I got a similar army hex about him, and my doubts were trying to interpret it as something that I need an army to protect me from him. Something negative so I can use that an excuse not to date again. I added another hex below, can you please help? Thank you so much!"
iching,fiuix6f,t1_fiuhh9s,1582742267.0,"My main question was: please give me insight to X on how he feels about me today? - this one. sorry for all the confusion. I'm just nervous:) 

I  asked another question just now: please give me insight if i should ask out X today? (not asking him to go on a date today but plan something) : I got 53 lines 2 and 6 to 48."

iching,fiuffk8,t1_fiueggn,1582740374.0,that's what I said 31 *to 33.* I'm concerned cos it looks positive (31)  *influence* but then to stay put *retreat.* So I'm not sure if I should put off pursuing the 1st guy I liked in 2 years.
Tinder,fiucm33,t1_fitslq8,1582738918.0,"yeah total i'll-make-you-drool-from-my-hotness-also-have-you-seen-my-dungeon?-guy. I'd swipe right on you after I screenshot your profile and send it to my bestfriend when we go on a date, just in case I never come back. But yeah you are totally cute, and you just need variety, with friends, doing something else than building a human cage. or i suggest, put up one of these and say something clever about it."

Tinder,fgsipq4,t1_fgs8brv,1581085352.0,The one with the bird should be your profile and delete that profile pic
Tinder,fgsim45,t1_fgsdxzi,1581085279.0,Your pictures are very blurry. The last two ones are ok. The rest replace it. And if you want flings don’t put pictures of women. How can a girl envision you as a fling if you got pics of women. Those are only good if we want to judge you character.
Tinder,fgke37o,t1_fgjr22f,1580863414.0,Yes. You’re very cute in the 3rd photo

(un)fortunately, I have a young face (thank you momma for the genes and sunscreen). it's sometimes not fun. especially when i'm 10+ yrs older than them. in my head, what's the point. my last LTR was 6 years younger than me."
