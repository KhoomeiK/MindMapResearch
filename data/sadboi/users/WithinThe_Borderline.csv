schizophrenia,fdgdyr2,t1_fdf9tf4,1578392244.0,">Thanks for your input. It comforts me to know in not the only one who went through this.

No you are not the only one, I had exactly the same delusion. I was convinced of it at the hospital. Increase your medication maybe, with the help of your doctor?"
schizophrenia,fdb3uji,t1_fd9xlod,1578253421.0,Thank you for sharing your experience!

schizophrenia,fdb3n5c,t1_fdaeks3,1578253336.0,"I also think that I have too much pressure to stay with people all day/night long so that's a great advice.

It makes sense don't worry."

schizophrenia,fd9nn5e,t1_fd628ni,1578235712.0,I still hear voices but they are less intrusive and I am less anxious about them. The worst ones are gone. Good luck.
schizophrenia,f7lsb7z,t1_f7exae5,1573847190.0,Thank you !
schizophrenia,f7ejphy,t1_f7eedbq,1573659187.0,thank you!
schizophrenia,f7e0qk4,t3_dvkwdv,1573640512.0,"Hello ! Believe me many schizophrenics experience the same symptoms. I also hear music, encouraging voices and voices like ""you are useless!"" 

Very hard to cope with.  Sending you good vibes. I hope you will find effective treatment. Finding the right treatment is very difficult, I know. I am treatment resistant as well. 

Some people say ""this medicine is the most effective"" but that's never true, because we react very differently to meds."
schizophrenia,f7e0h5b,t1_f7dxqsu,1573640076.0,Thank you :) I am on abilify since only eight days and I have a lot of voices. So I hope the positive symptoms will go away...
schizophrenia,f7bwcy6,t3_dv3wvp,1573579100.0,Love it! Your voices are terrifying though. Hope it will get better. :)

schizophrenia,f6ld2jr,t1_f6k2x3e,1572938529.0,"Thanks you, sounds like a great idea! 

""I think the less you focus on it, the less it occurs."" many doctors told me the exact thing!"
schizophrenia,f6jnxgp,t1_f6jiztz,1572897578.0,Thank you but then why the voices reflect my own thoughts? Is it a delusional symptom?
schizophrenia,f6jnv16,t1_f6jly4h,1572897549.0,"But it's exactly what I think at the moment ""oh I am so ugly"" and the voice say ""ugly ugly"" exactly the same day :("
schizophrenia,f6j7q5t,t3_drjqgv,1572890455.0,"I am so happy for you, I know this feeling!"

schizophrenia,f4106gv,t1_f40vtag,1571311954.0,I have the same issues for the lyrics. Usually I do not think the lyrics are about me but sometimes I feel like the lyrics give me messages. However I am not completely delusional about it and fortunately have some insight. Maybe the interest will come back.
schizophrenia,f40zphk,t1_f40y73n,1571311670.0,I agree!
schizophrenia,f40ujet,t3_dihpq9,1571308300.0,"There are so much schizophrenic people who see the ""hat man"". Very nice drawing!"
