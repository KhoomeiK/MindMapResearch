I get what you‚Äôre saying about false negatives, gay men not knowing their own status, etc. But this policy *does* affect gay men disproportionately. Why doesn‚Äôt the screening process ask something like ‚ÄúAre you a man that had *unsafe* sex with a man?‚Äù The way it‚Äôs worded (and in some conservative states, it does mean ‚Äúever‚Äù), you do you have to lie about it. The straight population may statistically not carry HIV, but the same data errors would affect their blood as well...i.e. false positives.  

It is a policy that seems rooted in homophobia from a bygone era. HIV isn‚Äôt gone, I know, but I would argue that in 2020, all subsets of any demographic carry a near equal statistical variant of ‚Äúbad blood.‚Äù For example: What Irish says here is how I got blacklisted; they found out I had lied about it. This is nearly identical to my military experience where they found out, and gave me my pink slip. FYI: I am HIV -, always practice safe sex and have never even had an STD/STI.

1.) IT ISN‚ÄôT ABOUT YOU! I don‚Äôt care if you get Covid. Good for you. You took that risk when protesting to ‚Äúreopen the economy.‚Äù It‚Äôs what you want? Great. **Now listen up** because I‚Äôm getting real tired of repeating myself:  

2.) **THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID ARE OFTEN ASYMPTOMATIC!** That means you can have the virus WITHOUT showing symptoms WHILE YOU SPREAD IT to people who *cannot* fight it off. If you‚Äôre confused by this, just refer to #1.  

3.) STOP GIVING PEOPLE WHO WEAR MASKS GRIEF! Again, if you‚Äôre confused by this, please see point #1. People are still wearing masks because they don‚Äôt want to catch it and more to the point, because **I** don‚Äôt know if **I** have it and don‚Äôt want to spread to *you.* People who wear masks are doing YOU a favor, NOT making a political statement.  

4.) THE ECONOMY DOES NOT REPRESENT YOU! You want your city/state to reopen? Great. Me too. But please STOP fighting *for* the economy as if it were ‚Äúthe underdog.‚Äù The economy only reflects MAJOR SHIFTS in the marketplace and really only represents the richest of us who (even  now) own stock. Are you a hedge-fund manager? Do you own stock? No? Then please, stfu.  

5.) YOU WANNA GO TO CHURCH? FINE. But please just stay there. You should also be okay with someone locking the doors. I really, REALLY don‚Äôt want want to run into one of your mask-less, zealot, (possibly) virus-carrying, sociopathic members of your congregation during one of my essential runs to the grocery store.

Your arrogant, insulting, power-trips who lack a shred of community and good-will, all the while safely protected behind your iron fortress, rolling out edicts for the consumer (the peasant) that you as mods don‚Äôt equally stand by creates this detestable hypocrisy. You further the grind of our meaninglessness and what we post based on whatever mood you‚Äôre in that day when arbitrarily rejecting it. You break your own rules constantly. And when anyone of us call you out on it, we‚Äôre banned. It‚Äôs like your shielding your ego from the truth.

Additionally, that‚Äôs not how banning works. Just because you don‚Äôt like someone or posts something you may not get at first or dislike isn‚Äôt grounds for deleting or banning and that is what has happened to me. There is no recourse, no official appeals process just...did I catch a mod on a good day?  

Well I say F that. You obviously don‚Äôt care about my pain so why should I care about yours? I have no way of knowing what mood my mods will be in because (and this part is important) **I CAN‚ÄôT READ MINDS.** 

I am also a real person, not a bot, not trying to incite a riot...just posting what I think and feel as I experience a show, a common interest, or other hobby. That‚Äôs it. Not trying to pad my numbers...I literally don‚Äôt give a shit about how many upvotes I get.  

I think with all the bot and troll activity, it has become hard to differentiate. So it could turn you guys cold, rigid or aggressive. But maybe that‚Äôs the time you step down as mod? When your lust for deleting and banning exceeds that of just normal interactions and reactions to what‚Äôs going on all around us. That‚Äôs the magic. And I really thought that was Reddit.
