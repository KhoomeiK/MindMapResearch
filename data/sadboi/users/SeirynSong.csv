Even though my situation is completely different from the OP’s, I feel like I have a better understanding of why I am struggling with some of the things I’m doing. In example, I was horribly traumatized by a therapist 14 years ago due to this therapist losing their objectivity. It began with eroding the boundary between provider and client. I am situated with a different therapist now, and we have done a lot of work on that experience. But I find myself wanting him to cross those lines. I fantasize about him abusing me. I have been too ashamed to admit this to anyone."

I happen to think that is a great example of how a movie has aged poorly, because what was seen as a dreamy relationship dynamic back then can be recognized presently as toxic. In example, I was a 90’s kid, and whenever a boy was mean to me, I was told by teachers and parents, “He is just mean to you because he likes you!” It isn’t a stretch to see how that kind of “advice” to girls back then is exactly why relationships like the one we’re discussing were seen as normal and desirable. As a culture, we still have a long way to go the stop normalizing violence in relationships, but watching this one on screen is particularly awkward as it has none of our modern awareness."

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fqvty2h,t1_fqvt8h8,1589685114.0,"I think if the intent were to wound, she would have had hesitation marks around the injury sites. Coming from a former self-injurer, it just isn’t easy to slice at yourself, especially the first time. Darlie has no prior history of self-injury. She had no recent medical episodes involving being cut. If she had, the prosecution would certainly have discovered as much and brought it to trial as further proof that this was a plan put into motion months earlier. 

The knife used, and the injuries themselves, just do not strike me as consistent with someone trying to seriously injure themselves while pushing up against the basic impulse to stay alive. And if Darlie really did kill her boys for her lifestyle, then I think she would want to live and her injuries should be consistent with that. She would have erred in the other direction, like Diane Downs shooting herself in the arm but obviously clear of doing any real damage.

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fqvi00y,t3_gl263n,1589677684.0,"I actually thought she was guilty for the longest time. Then, I was recently watching some TV program about death row cases, and they discussed her injuries. I had never really heard much about them, beyond the prosecution’s assertion they were self-inflicted and ostensibly superficial.

The program displayed pictures of her injuries—those did not seem superficial to me, and then the show elaborated that the stab wound to her neck only avoided being fatal because her necklace was putting pressure on the artery that would have otherwise bled out. In the interview with her, the scar was still prominently on her throat, and it mentioned how her necklace had to be surgically removed because it was embedded in her neck.

That, to me, doesn’t square with a calculating, deliberate child killer motivated to murder her children to enjoy an extravagant lifestyle. It also doesn’t square with the prosecution’s depiction of her as a selfish, vain bimbo (I think they even mentioned in court that she had gotten breast implants to underscore this accusation). I mean, which is it? Can bimbos be so cunning as to take out life insurance policies on their expendable offspring, concocting a murder scenario that includes stabbing themselves—almost to death—as well? And if she is such a vain bimbo who only cares about her lifestyle and vanity, why would she willingly inflict such a savagely disfiguring injury on herself?

She just couldn’t have known that the necklace would fall into place. And I don’t think someone who has coldly murdered two of her children would be so incompetent as to accidentally almost stab herself to death."

Your son has spent months lambasting his wife for the audacity of gaining weight while carrying twins, and having the kind of behaviors we know to expect of pregnant women—hormones for mood swings, eating what they might not otherwise—and being incredibly passive aggressive in voicing that displeasure to her. A fucking gym membership? Really? Strange how your son is such an adherent of a healthy lifestyle, but didn’t pull out that card until now.

And for someone who brags about being a woman and knowing things on that basis, the humble brag of your son not cheating on his pregnant wife and your own daughter magically losing all the baby weight in six weeks is weird. First of all, honoring the commitment to be monogamous just because your DIL is rocking a pregnant body isn’t a virtuous act on your son’s part. GTFOH with that. And, your DIL hadn’t even had the babies during the time comparison you’re making. It isn’t a good argument; it just reemphasizes that you, and your son by extension, are assholes. Not to mention that all bodies are different.

Also, all of that other stuff could be open to interpretation, but the real quest you’re asking here is whether YTA for encouraging your son to stay away from the delivery room. Yes. Jesus, this shouldn’t need more justification, but your reasoning is dripping with so much fucking internalized misogyny and paternalism, it’s clear you need crayons to explain it. 

I can’t even wrap my head around the idea that men need to be “protected” from the trauma of women giving birth to the children they helped father. That was not your call to make, and that your son allowed you to make it for him speaks volumes about what kind of a husband he is. He had an obligation to be with his wife and his daughters THEN, but his selfish, immature ass decided to hide behind his umbilical cord attached to you.

It’s more common place to talk about how Yelp screws over restaurants and other types of consumer-driven small businesses, but I’ve refused to forgive Yelp for how they screw over community health centers. While disputing a review as fake by insisting the customer never used your services may not be a compelling argument for Yelp to flag reviews, healthcare providers are in a position that doesn’t really let them confirm or deny whether someone actually is a patient due to HIPAA, and those smug assholes count on it.

I experienced this when I worked at a community health center that specialized in women’s reproductive health. We received a negative review blasting us because a patient paid for rented goods with what the author of the review alleged was a stolen credit card. The reality is, we did no such thing. Whenever anyone rents one of our items, we make a copy of not only the card, but the ID. When there’s a situation where the card doesn’t belong to the renter, we only allow it if the person to whom the card belongs is in the office and signing off as a guarantor. And guess what? We make a copy of their ID then too, and they have to sign a contract. She also signed the contract as a guarantor, which stipulates the rental return date, and the product was not returned by the date, so we were legally within our rights to charge the card for the cost of the unreturned item.

The guarantor was pissed and didn’t think they should be on the hook for the contract, but there was nothing that I could do. I had no authority to return the transaction, especially as the equipment had not been returned. 

However, because we are a community health center, privacy rights come into play. We can’t provide Yelp with a copy of the contract to dispute the claim without violating HIPAA. I no longer work at the community health center, but I still look at the Yelp page every once in a while and see that shitty, untrue claim and it pisses me off."

UnresolvedMysteries,fojzmw6,t1_foixcwk,1587832585.0,I don’t know why people are downvoting this comment. The language we use around suicide can either break or reinforce the stigma. I appreciate the reminder.
UnresolvedMysteries,fojz64c,t1_foimx8x,1587832325.0,"This. Next month will be the two-year anniversary of the suicide of a close friend. We were all blindsided, especially her husband and daughter. She was a social worker who had met with her own therapist the day she died. No one suspected anything was wrong. 

Part of the agony of suicide is being left behind with questions you will never get answered. Why did she do it? What about that day made her decide, “Today is the day”? What secrets that might have explained how she got to this point did she take to her grave? What signs did we all miss?

Although I don’t know the answers, I can speculate on a few. The First is that I think in helping professions, there’s a real taboo against being someone who needs healing. My friend did have a therapist—a damn good one, which I know because I was her client myself—but I’m not sure she could bring herself to admit to our therapist how much she was struggling. Particularly because my friend’s perception of self was wrapped up in her identity as a social worker. She specialized in working with addicts, and recently had taken a leave of absence related to losing a client to suicide. In hindsight, the flags are there, but without my friend providing us with the language to connect the dots, we can hardly be blamed for not knowing that these developments pointed to a person in crisis. Ultimately, she was the last person anyone would have expected to die by suicide.

In contrast, I’ve had multiple attempts. I’ve been very outspoken about my past experiences. While I can say I’m not chronically suicidal any longer, if I ever do die that way, I expect it won’t be met with much skepticism or surprise."

That’s fairly extreme thinking in and of itself, which abounds in your replies here. Most troubling is that your rhetoric is flawed by executing a false dichotomy where Westerners aren’t allowed to call out rights violations in other countries because our own is steeped within them. It’s also typical deflection.

The United States is it’s own cesspool, granted. No argument here. I’m on generation removed from the Reservation and my family was part of the so-called Scoop Generation, so yes, I am well aware that schools can be prisons and minority children are disproportionately imprisoned for not attending these institutions. I also think religion has caused significantly more harm than not and the worst thing to happen to American politics is the rise of the Reagan-era Moral Majority.

That still doesn’t make religious-driven and politically-motivated genocide okay. China isn’t automatically right just because the United States has often been wrong."

My mom to me numerous times over the years. For context, I had two siblings that died before I was born.

So yeah, I experienced a lot of sadness that these two perfect kids died and my parents were burdened with a fuck-up like me. I know now I wasn’t a fuck-up, and that my parents were just really terribly abusive—albeit understandably traumatized due to losing two kids—people who were so dysfunctional, I attempted to kill myself at nine because I believed that if I died, I would finally be worthy enough for them to love."

AskReddit,fng32y3,t1_fndu4t7,1586921172.0,"I’m a stepmom myself, and unfortunately, I find myself in agreement with you about many of the stepparents I’ve encountered in my life. I used to be very active in numerous step groups on social media, but I left them all because I couldn’t stomach the inherent misogyny these women would spew. Especially when that misogyny manifested in slamming kids who did nothing wrong but exist as a reminder that once upon a time, these seemingly perfect husbands and fathers had a relationship with someone else that didn’t work out.

And look, being a stepparent is a thankless job. It’s honestly harder than parenting your own child, in my experience. I think the feeling of powerlessness is a major reason why. A lot of that is due to the antagonistic relationships that make true, authentic coparenting a pipe dream for many. 

But it’s certainly not the fault of the children. I mean, my stepchild is the product of my husband cheating on me, and I would still never dream of blaming him. Or letting the issues I have with his mom become his problems, or problems with him. I wish his mom would take the same approach. The fact she doesn’t is why I have such issues with her in the first place, but I digress. 

I also have this view because my own former stepmother—if you can call her that—is a piece of work. She has always been jealous of the relationship I have with my dad, and acted like any time my dad spent with me was cheating on her or something. Keep in mind that I was 17 when they started seeing each other, living on my own. And rather than deal with her shit like the 30-something year-old woman with kids she was in their decade-long relationship, she opted to get drunk and physically assault me multiple times instead, including once when I was pregnant. I finally took out a restraining order after getting fed up with my dad’s excuses and enabling, and knowing I needed to protect myself. 

They aren’t together any longer, but I have never forgiven my dad for enabling her bullshit for so long, and at the expense of our relationship. Aa far as she’s concerned, though, it would be impossible for my opinion of her to sink any lower. You see, in addition to being a stepmom myself, and a stepchild, I’m also the guardian of the child she and my father had together. My relationship with him matters more than feeling vindicated in talking about what a garbage human she is, so to this day, he has never heard me say a bad word about his mom. Mostly because he lives with her abandonment everyday—nothing I could say is worse than that very painful truth.

But ultimately, parents who share kids have got to remember to love the children involved more than they hate the other person. It’s hard. It sucks. And I am not perfect in this, but I am someone who gets it right more often than not so I find it absolutely maddening when others don’t."

AskReddit,flu1v0k,t3_fr2sxl,1585493302.0,"I landed my dream job in the nonprofit world and started working March 9 (on boarded for four before the virus had the execs deciding we should all work from home so getting up to speed has been kind of scattershot).

I’m treating my mental and physical health with a higher priority. Next month will be the one year anniversary of my decision to seek out residential treatment for my C-PTSD. I spent two months working through emotional scars 30 years in the making, and I did it all while simultaneously fighting through both mono and shingles (what can I say? I guess I really needed to be completely beaten down to work through my shit). I’ve kept up my wellness routines in the time since; no small feat for someone who, prior to that, believed suicide was an inevitability.

One of my best friends had a baby in January, so I’m no longer the only parent in our friend circle (although our daughters are a decade apart). Another one of my close friends is currently expecting her rainbow baby, and she’s asked me to be her doula.

I spent the months of January through March doing overnights at a warming shelter for the unhoused. I met so many incredible people there, and I don’t just mean the other staff members, though several of them have become close friends. The work was humbling and inspiring, easy and grueling simultaneously. Many times after my shift ended, I came home and cried myself to sleep. But it generated some incredible breakthroughs in therapy, and it helped give me the courage to go after the aforementioned dream job, in part because the shelter’s vice-president sought me out personally to tell me I needed to pursue a career that involved social welfare because I was a natural.

I also decided to try learning Spanish, even though my learning disability makes language acquisition difficult. Three months into DuoLingo, I’m surprised at how much literacy I’ve gained!

We also added two cats to our family, one in January and one a few weeks ago, and they are already completely bonded. The January cat is a kitten while the March cat is probably about a year old, so they spend most of their time playing, and their antics have helped us get through the quarantine."

A lot of it is, I think, is projection with how the government let us down, so there’s also this sense that we can’t trust what they say. That isn’t how I feel, but that is a recurrent theme in the “Hahaha sheeple, this is just THE FLU and I’m not giving into the hype by distancing” style posts I’ve been seeing.

I was severely abused at home, and the abuse destroyed my self-esteem to the point that I was both easy prey for bullies and extremely toxic emotionally to the few friends I did have. One of the most difficult aspects is that neither my home nor my school were safe outlets for me. My parents didn’t care how badly I was being treated at school so I knew they wouldn’t do anything for me, and my school refused to do anything to help me with how badly I was being treated at home. I attended a prestigious public school in a wealthy district in the Midwest, so as long as I had clean clothes and good hygiene it didn’t matter that they were abusing me.
