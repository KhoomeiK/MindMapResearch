I'm in a horrible depression. Have been for months and all I want in the world is some pot to smoke :'c it helps me escape and helps me to feel content.

So right now I'm in a horrible place where it feels like the meds are doing nothing and I have no pot to smoke to chill me out. I can't imagine not smoking the moment I have the chance to. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm completely isolated living by myself and my parents are now ignoring me because I keep asking for some money for pot because I know it will help me get through the next few weeks safely. As of right now I am in hell and I keep visualising cutting myself. I used to do that a decade ago when I first started experiencing mental health problems. I know it's a horrible idea and I am fighting not to do it and just the visualisation is giving me some slight relief but I'm hurting and feel completely alone in the world.

I should probably be in an inpatient facility but I have a lot of rage and a lot of that rage is directed at authorities and the last time I went to a psych ward( twice I got released and was back within a week) it was a horrible experience.

I'm so sorry you're having to survive like that. When I had my first mental health crisis I was prescribed xannax among other things and my parents kept the xannax and I would have to ask for it everytime and give them an explanation. I ended up nearly dying when I broke into their room and took a handful of my meds along with a handful of my dad's painkillers and my mom's valium



Yeah the only hope I have left in the moment is that the meds start to help and that my psychiatrist will be able to help me quickly. My fear is that this will be years and years of this madness and med changes with side effects. All I want is to complete my old escape method by smoking pot while I watch movies and play video games. But my psychiatrist told me not to smoke pot and I don't have the money to get any anyways.  


Part of me doesn't believe it's possible for meds to help this and I'm skeptical of the people here saying they are great now because of the meds. I find it hard to believe that I will ever be stable. Part of me kind of knows that this is all treatment resistant and I just want to be allowed to continue to just escape reality forever"
