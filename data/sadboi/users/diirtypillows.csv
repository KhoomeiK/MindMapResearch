BipolarReddit,f95t83z,t3_e3w3ue,1575134980.0,Holy poop. I was just asking my partner if they struggle with mental noise or if it‚Äôs a bp thing. Now I know ;)
legaladvice,f88w67a,t1_f88v67b,1574362471.0,Thank you so much for replying. I am worried about adverse actions due to just asking them to justify the charges. I don‚Äôt want the to report negatively to my new landlord if they see it as a refusal.
BipolarReddit,f1sv01z,t1_f1rro6m,1569734481.0,Thank you so much. I really needed to hear that.  My biggest fear is that my mental illness will end up fucking my kids over.  I value hearing this so so much.
bipolar,ezxq7i3,t3_d2rowd,1568246869.0,"This made me laugh so hard! I actually did this. It kind of started out as a joke but I ended up inviting my family over for brunch and a ‚ÄúMental Illness reveal‚Äù

BipolarReddit,ezpptiw,t3_d0imvx,1568045735.0,Sending so much love to you. I think the only way we can get through this is with each other. Honestly I don‚Äôt know what I would have done with out all the wonderful responses from you and everyone else. I don‚Äôt feel so hopeless and alone and I am finally going to make it back to work today. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll finish the day or if I‚Äôll make it tomorrow but I‚Äôm going and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to commit to. One foot in front of the other. Thank you so much again ‚ù§Ô∏è
BipolarReddit,ezlnid6,t1_ezey67s,1567978994.0,"I‚Äôve read this probably 5 times in the last couple days. Thank you so much this reminder has helped me immensely. Just the one day at a time aspect and taking things especially feelings as they come. I feel utterly paralyzed by this, it the only way I can describe it. I hope this gets better in time with lots of practice taking it as it comes.

Thank you again so much I appreciate you"

BipolarReddit,ezeuzou,t1_ezanyxz,1567869184.0,"My therapist definitely wants me doing more hobbies. Its weird though I feel like I have completely forgotten what I like to do and what my hobbies are. Video games are an easy choice and readily available distraction. 

Seriously though, relationships are the hardest part of this whole damn thing."
BipolarReddit,ezeugmp,t1_ez9whbe,1567868998.0,"This is probably one of the hardest things for me to do right now. I feel so selfish unproductive, especially when I wake up with a prospective to do list a mile long. How do you differentiate self care and avoidant behavior? I feel like that is the hardest delineation for me."
BipolarReddit,ezeu1z4,t1_ezac1y1,1567868850.0,On my way to go put it in my amazon cart right now. Thanks for the tip!

BipolarReddit,ez9xhp5,t1_ez9x3er,1567791307.0, Joy & Kindness. I can do that. I think I need to handle myself with kid gloves.
BipolarReddit,ez9umml,t1_ez9q8oj,1567789804.0,"Thank you for the encouragement. I really needed to hear from someone that it‚Äôs ok to stay home when it‚Äôs like this. I‚Äôve been trying to sleep as much as I can, but you‚Äôre right there‚Äôs not a lot of sleep to be had when feeling like this. I think today I‚Äôm going to just play Skyrim cause I can‚Äôt really trust myself to do anything else."
BipolarReddit,ez9u4kb,t1_ez9q7fn,1567789541.0,"Thank you for the advice, I think that‚Äôs a good way to stay on track. Also your username is üëåüèª it legitimately made my laugh out loud"
