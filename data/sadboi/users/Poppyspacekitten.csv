I'm graduating this December with a psychology and human development bachelors. This whole time I have thought I'd pursue a clinical psych masters, now I'm thinking social work. I have a couple questions:

Will social work offer a wider range of career paths? 

Will an online program hinder my chances of getting a job?

What made you decide to pursue a MSW versus a masters in psychology? 

Thanks so much!"
