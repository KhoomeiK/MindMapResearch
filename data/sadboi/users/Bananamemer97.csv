They just have two characters look at each other and then a second later its soft core porn with a girl screaming. Like I dont mind sex scenes if its obvious that its about to happen, because at least I get the chance to turn it down, but Netflix loves surprising you with how lewd they can make their show"

mentalhealth,fpl0e3l,t3_ge1dz0,1588704169.0,"I hated how they made her suicide like a revenge plot against the people who wronged her. It also made her suicide to be this thing that can be easily explained by bad life events. Bad trauma isn't the only cause of suicide. It is also combined with mental illness and a severe chemical imbalance in the brain. Like it never really felt like I was watching someone who was depressed. Also in the second season clay keeps seeing her and talking to her, and it made it seem like she wasn't really gone. But suicide ends everything, you dont get to see the aftermath. Also what they did with Tyler was fucking terriable. He almost shoots up a dance. But clay runs in front of him and talks him out of it and the friend group decides to watch over him at all times instead of turning him into the police."
