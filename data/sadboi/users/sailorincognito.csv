AmItheAsshole,fov6m0k,t3_g9nhjo,1588096225.0,"I think YTA because the comment was made purely to hurt them and you don't seem to care much about that now since you got what you wanted. However, taking into account the whole situation and all the rejection and how you may be feeling and the fact that you are still only 19, I understand. 


I do feel bad for your biological parents though. They chose to go through the pregnancy, apparently hid it from literally everyone in their lives, and brought you into this world and left you somewhere they assumed you would be taken care of. The fact they stayed together even after that makes me feel like they decided that was the best choice together and it was probably very difficult. I feel like they likely did separate due to the guilt and pressure going on right now, they could be arguing about how to go about to situation as well as maybe blame each other for essentially being ousted from their community. I don't blame them for not wanting contact with you but it would be impossible to not expect you to be resentful.
I hope they understand your point of view too and how you must be feeling. 

Good luck finding the family that's meant to be yours!"

WDP,fm4eu45,t1_fm49ffh,1585752737.0,I agree with this but I also do think there's an overwhelming amount of kids who do it not due to abuse but their own issues and being unable to help themselves or not having someone there for them. My family wasn't abusive but they weren't very understanding especially when it came to anxiety and being depressed. I was hospitalized twice and lived in the hospital for almost 9 months at a time and I can say like 75% of the teens that went in there had more personal issues than being actually abused. I agree that it is definitely a cry for help though and it was a cry for help for me as well. You just feel so overwhelmed and especially if you've been depressed for a long time it almost feels like you need to do something drastic so people will take your pain seriously. Plus the peaky side effect of it becoming an addiction is serious too. I'm glad things got better for you :)

I'm a girl dating a girl and porn is very casual between us, we even watch it together and are subscribed to a few OnlyFans profiles. I talk casually about open with my friends too. Generally when people watch open it's not really because they're like super into the people on the screen. Sex is a primal instinct and (for some people) it isn't always connected with love.


Also, sometimes we get off to things in porn that we probably wouldn't even actually try in real life. Or that aren't realistic 
Like when people watch hentai especially with random shit like tenticles and stuff it doesn't mean that they are only exclusively attracted to that and need it. It just means it makes their brain and sex parts go DING DING DING. 


I romantically identify as a lesbian but I watch straight porn and also gay (male/male) porn. 


Don't overthink it too much. The pain from knowing they watch that comes from you feeling insecure and inadequate as it is (which you seem to already know) so I would advise you to instead of focusing on what they're doing, focus on your own feeling about it and everything connected to it. Try to shift your brain from thinking it's an issue with them and try to work on why that makes you feel that way, where it comes from, and what would make you feel better that's realistic and not demanding of them to abstain from something that's honestly very normal"

But don't look into the I love you too much, if anything it just means she really does appreciate you as a friend and she felt the full sentences was more appropriate especially since it was your birthday. She wanted to sound sincere.
I tell my friends luv u or love you but the ones I say I love you to are my absolute closest friends and I say it fully bc I 100% mean it. As opposed to a random friend who I see once in a while, I do care for them but not to the level of a friend just share my every day with if that makes sense"
relationship_advice,fjktzw8,t1_fjkev31,1583433868.0,"If you're really good friends that does make it a little harder because it's hard to know if she just really appreciates you as a homie or if she wants more 
You say you have banter and jokes together, try to make it just a little more flirty and see how she reacts. 
She called you cute and even as friends I feel like that might mean something! 
You also don't want to assume and have it be awkward lol. 
As a girl myself, I'd say test the waters. Maybe mention to another friend that you've been thinking a lot about her and didn't know if she may feel the same way but didn't want to make your friendship awkward because you care about her separately from that. I feel like that somehow would make its way back to her and then it's not so direct and you can be like ""oh no I'm embarrassed I didn't mean for you to know!""
Ordered invite her out somewhere like to eat or the movies. Something small not even like a real date like idk froyo or something and be like I'm excited to hang out just you and I :) so that again it's not so explicit and it kinda leaves her wondering and go off her body language and stuff. Or straight up be like I know we're homies but when we playfully flirt and stuff I kinda mean it and it's cool if you just want to be homies but I was wondering if you wanted to try me out and go to _______ with me? And if she says yes them awesome and if she says no just be cool about it be like it's cool I didn't want things to be weird anyways and id hate to lose you as a friend, just thought I should give it a shot so I have no regrets :)"

She most definitely seems to be in the spectrum and the chaos between her parents and on how to raise her must be so confusing and frustrating for her. 
It's really sad because there are her formative years, and she clearly answers to reason and patience and care. She's good with you guys, shes learning boundaries, gratitude, patience, etc. 


I would say talk to her parents and try to get her some professional help because her life will it get harder and the older she gets the less that people will want to help because people don't feel much empathy towards teenagers with behavioral issues. 


If her parents will not do that which sadly I think is likely because it would mean they have to admit wrongdoing, then the best thing you can do is continue to give her a safe space. Explain to her maybe why her parents react to her in certain ways and acknowledge that it's confusing. Obviously you won't want to undermine her parents as she's their child after all but I find that understanding that other people have problems and stuff helps. She knows she feels out of control sometimes so it may help her to understand that happens to everyone, especially her parents. Kids don't connect adults to being ""normal"" ""real"" people like them. 
If anything else try to get her diagnosed, a child with autism that doesn't understand what is happening will only become frustrated and angry and that will morph into worse things with age"
relationship_advice,fjjzdqh,t1_fjjxwk0,1583416409.0,"It takes time but slowly. Don't expect to be a Casanova overnight but focus more on the internal feelings than the outside factors. Change the way you think about yourself and the way you approach relationships 

When you meet someone new, instead of thinking an I good enough? Am I attractive enough? Am I interesting enough? etc, shift that thought and question that about the other person. What DO you require in a potential partner? 

See, when you have low self esteem, you continuously think about what you're lacking. And when you feel so low about yourself, almost everybody feels high above you. So your standards are low. It's usually just ""will this person like me"" and then the whole interaction becomes about approval rather than making an effortless connection which is what a relationship is

Anyways, I'm sorry it didn't work out with this girl :/ because regardless of there being other fish in the sea, you liked her and that's a huge letdown. 


Just keep trying :) try different approaches, go on more dates even if just to practice! You'll be alright"

As a person who also formerly tried to ""save"" my friends from shitty choices and situations, especially relationships, I will give you this piece of advice though:
Don't give advice unless you're asked for it. Even then, try to keep things light as people rarely really ask for advice, they just want to be validated. 


Nothing you can do will make your friend see the ""light""
No matter how painfully obvious it is and how frustrating. He will resent you, as he ready has, and nothing will change. 
You can't see reason through rose colored glasses, and as messed up as it sounds it really is not your problem. 
Hopefully your friend relaxes and comes around and realizes he's an idiot, but don't bet on it. And know that if he or another friends are in a situation like that again, just butt out tbh"

Write this whole post out, exactly the way it is, but directed to him. Don't sugarcoat anything and send it. 
More than likely he won't listen and he'll feel attacked because it's nothing that he hasn't heard before. He knows it's true. It's a pattern. He knows what he put his wife through, he knows how this is affecting your cousin. He does not care. His priority is himself and how HE feels."

with her if may be different because she's known you so she knows your history but next time you go out with someone, especially for the first time don't mention anything about how you were or what you overcame. Just exist in your new body and feel secure that you're good looking and cool. If you're expecting rejection and failure that's all you're going to get. If you still see yourself as a fat loser that's how you're going to come across

Clearly you can get a first date, so that's not an issue. Pay attention to the things you say and how you're presenting yourself."
relationship_advice,fjjwn9i,t3_fduwph,1583414336.0,"Has she seen a psychologist? At 12 she's old enough to know better, especially when the consequences of what she's doing have been explained to her. ESPECIALLY coming from you who she does seem to care for and listen to a little more. She lacks empathy and at her age it's not a matter of ""she doesn't know better yet.""

Unfortunately I don't think there's much you specifically can do as you're doing all you can by talking to her, explaining things to her, not giving in when she pushes, etc. Are her parents doing that at all? Or are they enabling her? That's the first problem right there, if she is being enabled most of the time by the main people in her life. 

I also ask if she's seen a psychologist because such lack of empathy and complete disregard for others is not normal at her age, especially when she does have people who care for her and put effort into her. 
She may have autism seeing how noises and stuff bother her, even her friends overwhelm her. It's possible she's living through this life consistently on edge because her surroundings are too much for her. Autism or ADHD come to mind."
relationship_advice,fjjw5fe,t3_fduzz8,1583413935.0,"Find a balance. If you're always emotional and get angry easily and cry and complain a lot, that's hard to deal with and it's what will be expected of you. You'll come across as weak and emotionally stunted. 
If you act all alpha like nothing bothers you and you don't open up then you're going to seem harsh and unapproachable. 

Choose the things you decide to express emotion about. If it's something you can't help, instead of letting yourself be defeated and upset look for a solution without complaining and without getting angry. 
If she needs you to be soft for her, be it.

I'd also like to add that while what she did is crazy, you memorizing those numbers and messaging them to follow up is fucking weird. Like it's good that you did it or else you wouldn't know this, but hypothetically say this wasn't the case and she did date them. Like, wtf dude.

You sound young so I'm going to tell you this and please remember it: no man or person should EVER tell you what to do or not do. Take a step back and think about why you're upset he wasnt upset with you and deconstruct that. 
That's a very unhealthy way to think, that's the type of mindset that people take advantage of. Narcissists and sociopaths seek naiveness like this because it allows them to justify controlling people for the sake of ""love.""

Tell her you don't want to know about other people's business and that it makes you feel nervous that she may be talking about yours. Mention it feels unethical as she also has a duty to her other clients. 

She may be way too comfortable with you and feels like she can't trust you, especially since the things she tells you kind of are connected to you.

If you're willing to be ok with it then yeah you should comfort her because people do make mistakes and she got scammed and that sucks. Dudes on the internet suck and especially if she's done it before with no issues, this blindsided her. 


Now if you're not okay, then make that completely clear or break up with her. It's obvious it wasn't clear to her whether this was a deal breaker or not so you show decide if you really actually care or not instead of asking random Reddit dudes who look down on girls that sell sex related things. 

Anyways, I've been with my girlfriend for 6 years and she makes pretty good money on onlyfans. I help her with videos and stuff and I find it pretty fun and chill but I'm personally completely okay with that.

I just turned 24 this past week and cut myself from 5th/6th grade you until 3 years ago. If you want to know more details feel free to message me but I will say this: if you feel like you want to and you haven't before just don't do it. It's dumb. It'll affect you for the rest of the life because scars are very obvious. I can't go through a job interview without wearing long sleeves and I always get comments and looks and questions. It sucks. It feels like people don't take me seriously or think that I'm dumb or pathetic when they see my scars. 
I could prove myself to be intelligent, diligent, inspiring, etc. And people will see my scars before all of that. 
Plus I live in southern California and it's rest freaking hot here so it sucks to have to wear long sleeves so often. I also for part of it covered up with a tattoo and it hurt a lot because scars tissue sucks. 


So in conclusion: don't do it. It won't make you feel better and it's going to affect you your whole life. Plus people wont look at you with sympathy or care, they will look at you with pity. No one wants to be pitied."
