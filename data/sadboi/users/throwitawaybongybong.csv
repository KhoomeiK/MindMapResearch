bipolar,fprgdui,t3_gdzd2y,1588853422.0,"Also, people who abuse methamphetamine will eventually begin to see ""shadow people"". Objects in the 4th dimension have a 3-dimensional shadow.

These characters seem to mainly reveal themselves to meth heads who have remained high for far too long. I have first hand experience with this. I could snort a line and go to sleep it had become so normal for me. I saw them climbing up the stairs to my grandma's attic. I saw them in the corners of my eyes when I was outside at night, along with strange flashes of light. A static film like an old TV would come over my whole world before I had such visions.

It was overall a very trying experience. I would not suggest it to anyone. Sweating that out alone was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but it had been half a year and it needed to be done.

So, in conclusion, I believe that certain drugs can also grant the ability to see into other dimensions, although whether you like what you see is up in the air at that point.

Ah ha ha. . . Shadow people are just about the most terrifying shit ever at first. Then they're just kinda ""meh"" after a while. It's knowing you're psychotic and also supermanic that gets you eventually. What does go up must come down.

I went through years of recovery for just six months of addiction. When they say not to try it once, they mean it. It rewires your brain from the first hit. Speaking generally, you'll find yourself thinking about it a couple weeks later, like ""Damn, that was good. The comedown was rough but I can deal."" Then you'll call up your buddy. Now you've done it twice. Then you'll feel pretty big for your britches, so you'll do it again the week after that. Now you want it every day. Now you need it every day. That's how fast it happens."

Drink plenty of water while taking it. I recommend taking the dose with a full glass of water, then drinking 3-5 more full glasses of water throughout the day.

Eat when  you take your dose. If your doc told you to take it at night, take it with dinner. In the morning? With breakfast.

ALWAYS consume something with your lithium, even if it's just a glass of milk.
