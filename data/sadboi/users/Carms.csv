So, of course, she said yes that was why so now she's moving this Friday. Since you said you don't things will be back normal because of the pandemic that literally seems like that is the reason you are moving so I'd say that if they ask or just bring it up."

blackladies,fgusse3,t3_f0frkd,1581128608.0,"That's crazy because I'm that type of girl. It's not that I don't get along with other women I just have literally no clue how to talk to them or what to talk about with them. All but 1 of my best friends are a woman (out of 5 total). My other best friends are like my brothers especially since I don't have any brothers. I get along with guys way better than girls we just have a lot more interests in common and at least for my guy friends we're extremely laid back and don't like drama and I've noticed a lot of girls have drama in their life and that's the kinda stuff I like to live vicariously through them with it but ain't nobody tryna hear and deal with that every time we hang out (I'm not talking about abuse or any other important stuff like that). I have had issues with the guys I've dated in the past who didn't understand that you can actually have a platonic relationship with the opposite sex and the thought of being with any of my best friends would make me vomit as if I was being with a family member. 

But I can see the ""competition"" aspect. Some girls I've met used to think I was stuck up or hate that I was pretty and guys liked me but I'm hella goofy/friendly and most guys I view as friends. But after they actually get to know me or at least see how goofy I am they're cool. I just have so many experiences from growing up of girls being mean for literally no reason which made me distance myself from them. 

It sucks now since I have anxiety with hitting on girls and wish I knew how or what to talk about with them. A bitch just wants a girlfriend =/"

I make sure I'm in a quiet room by myself with the tv off and no background noise. Going in the closet was the best for clear audio. 

I have had some games crash/freeze while playing but I expect that since I know a lot of the games are in the alpha or beta phase. When that happens I try to open & use the app again. If it continues I just talk through what is happening so they have feedback. Then after I have completed all they want me to do or if nothing is solved I complete the survey and say what happened which is backed up with the screen recording and my vocal feedback. 

Overall I liked Playtest Cloud and recommended it to many of my friends. Lately, I haven't been able to do any since I work fulltime but will probably try to get some more when I take some time off for work.

I did have the whole session stop once because my bf at the time came in to ask me something and I feel like they knew I wasn't alone so I missed out on that money but that's why I started going into the closet to record."
confessions,f8phamj,t3_e1f0nt,1574701526.0,"I have 240+ hours on Skyrim (Xbox 360) and still haven't finished the main quests or chose a side to fight on. I still have a lot of side quest to start/finish and I may have a few more locations to discover. 

I did buy it on the PS4 when it came out so I have that to finish that and probably try a few more mods. 

I love that game!"
