college,fq27m67,t3_gglqdc,1589053556.0,"I work full time and typically take 3 - 4 classes online. When I take 4 classes at a time I’m completely burnt out, 3 is manageable for me. Everyone is different, plus you might be taking harder classes than others with your major. I wouldn’t worry too much about other people and just keep focusing on making it through your semester the best you can 👍"
Anxiety,fq264u9,t3_ggj92b,1589053176.0,"Hi. 24F in the same boat. I have been on a serious weight loss journey this year and down 20 lbs. I think our mind does play some tricks but at the same time different angles also make you potentially look worse in pictures. Same as some people just aren’t really photogenic or if the pic is snapped at the worse time, etc. Not sure if that helps any!"

Anxiety,fplwwkw,t3_ge5daj,1588721040.0,I’m sorry. Trust me I’ve been there and you should get on the other side hopefully. I have waves like this. What do you try to help your anxiety? Have you talked to your doctor? You’re not alone!
Anxiety,fplwnvc,t3_gdwcei,1588720905.0,Sort of. Sometimes when my dog barks or something is too loud I freak out and it makes me super anxious.
Anxiety,fowsu1g,t3_ga08oh,1588126402.0,"I have weird strings of days like this and it usually just passes. I think it happens more when I’m not sleeping enough. How long has it lasted for you?

When it happens to me I just take small bites and super chew my food because I’ll get this weird block in my throat that doesn’t want me to swallow the food otherwise and sometimes even stuck mid swallow and have to cough it up."
Anxiety,fowoasz,t3_g9z6vg,1588123757.0,"Yes! Courtesy of OCD. 

I also check my doors multiple times and make sure anything non essential is unplugged and the stove is off a hundred times even though I haven’t used it in months 😅"
Anxiety,fownzd0,t1_fown4yx,1588123576.0,Thank you for your suggestions! I don’t like tea but I think I’m going to look into finding one that I can tolerate to see if it helps.
Anxiety,fowh6x5,t1_fowh3z4,1588119705.0,"How long have you been experiencing it? I swear I’ve felt like this for at least the past year 😓

I went to my doctor and he did blood work and I do have iron deficiency anemia which causes you to feel like you can’t breathe supposedly. I went on iron supplements and it helped a little with my anxiety but I still feel like everyday I’m forcing myself to breathe."
