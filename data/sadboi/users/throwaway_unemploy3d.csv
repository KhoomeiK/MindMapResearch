personalfinance,f7dp0xw,t1_f7dmjq1,1573623866.0,"Hey man,

Sorry to hear about your situation. I can relate, I was laid off at the beginning of the year with no warning. I recently found a new job but the last few months were rough. Luckily I had plenty of saving so that was never an issue but despite my safety net being unemployed really took a toll on me emotionally. You mentioned you don’t think you’ll be able to find a job of the same salary, that might be ok, evaluate how difficult it will be to find a job you’re willing to take in general. If you think you can find a new job in a relatively short amount of time, for sure stay. If you think it might take awhile, consider transferring for a few months while you look for something new. While a job shouldn’t be your identity, as a person we start associating the value we bring from a job to our own self worth. I can tell you how I felt about myself when down the drain while job searching full time. Good luck with whatever you decide."

jobs,f5aqvv4,t3_dne061,1572112140.0,"I’ve seen it both ways, 

At my last company I was hired as an internal candidate. While the position was posted publicly for external candidates to apply, the position was specifically created for me to transfer teams. I don’t think they even bothered interviewing anyone other than me.

The new job I’m starting specifically told me while they do internal candidates they wanted to bring someone in externally for new ideas."

As for your interview, you probably don’t need to provide the exact story. As a contractor your contract or project ended. Some contracts are 1 year but I’ve been offered 1 month contracts as well."
