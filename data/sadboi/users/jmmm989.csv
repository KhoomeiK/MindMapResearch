Pickering,fmafcri,t3_fa6wtq,1585892311.0,I live just south of this area Liverpool. I had no idea this was happening in our neighborhood
BPD,fma3w0i,t3_ftxciw,1585883176.0,I understand exactly where you‚Äôre coming from. I am turning 20 at the end of the month and I feel like I‚Äôve just had such a different high school/ uni experience than a lot of other people. Like we can never get that time back again... shitty feeling but hopefully good times are ahead

BPD,flo6gsq,t3_fq03ea,1585332480.0,"I know this isn‚Äôt an ideal situation, far from it actually. But we do have the internet, there are so many ways you can connect with your FP if you want to: 

FaceTime or video calling to catch up and chat or do an activity together: painting baking etc. 

Joined video streaming, Chrome has a Netflix party extension which allows you to watch a show at the exact same time with someone and I believe there is a chat bar so you can talk about the show. I haven‚Äôt used it myself so I am unsure how well/ if it works. If it doesn‚Äôt there are for sure similar applications which allow you to do this.

If you‚Äôre just missing them and don‚Äôt feel like reaching out/ can‚Äôt just remember to keep in mind that they aren‚Äôt by your side physically only because of covid19 and it has nothing to do with you. I get this can be super difficult but it‚Äôs important to keep in mind. If you share more about your relationship/ how you want to connect with your FP I might be better able to share some thoughts/ ideas. üòä"
BPD,flo5sr0,t3_fq1nvp,1585332140.0,"I understand exactly how you feel. I haven‚Äôt eaten a meal since I‚Äôve been home when anyone else in my family was awake. 

I feel scared and too worthless to eat anything and if someone were to ever say anything to me about what I‚Äôm eating or how much etc. I would lose it. So maybe that‚Äôs why I also stay in my room, to avoid any negativity or comments I wouldn‚Äôt like so I can stay in a more ‚Äòclear‚Äô headspace."
BPD,flj4hvi,t1_flhu2ya,1585198650.0,I totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I have a session on skype tommorw üò≠

BPD,fldzp3m,t1_flapdgj,1585074843.0,Thanks so much for the advice. I‚Äôm going to try to bring it up to her.
BPD,flako0w,t3_fnhyuy,1584985762.0,"How do you bring the fact that you believe you have bpd to your psychiatrist? I want to bring it up but I‚Äôm afraid she might think that I‚Äôm manifesting it in my mind because I‚Äôve done so much research before hand. Or she won‚Äôt care or she‚Äôll drop me as a patient. 

I currently am diagnosed with depression and anxiety but the first time I read about bpd I felt a wave of relief because I thought that I finally figured out why I act the way I do. And in this reddit community, I have never felt more validated or heard. So ya any suggestions on How do you bring the fact that you believe you have bpd to your psychiatrist?"
BPD,flakadg,t3_fnex1t,1584985551.0,"I always have so many thoughts and feelings in my head, journaling has helped to put those words somewhere rather than have them lurking around in my mind all day or me just focusing on them all the time. 

It‚Äôs helped."

BPD,fkko0mh,t1_fkel5ky,1584288290.0,"In your experience, do you think it‚Äôs worth mentioning to your doctor... Sometimes I think that something may change if I stop smoking but like a lot of people are saying here like it just helps me get through the day and tough times and all of that. I‚Äôm nervous to tell my therapist because I feel like they would blame everything on that or blame me for not wanting to help myself."
rant,fkkmyx3,t1_fkkmxir,1584287650.0,It‚Äôs refreshing to see so many people with the same idea that I have. So validating
rant,fkkmxir,t3_firxl5,1584287625.0,"When I try to explain this to people, like how disgusting and unemphatic everyone is in this world no one cares. No one agrees and says I‚Äôm overreacting. But it‚Äôs true everyone is so caught up in neoliberalism and capitalism no one gives a shit about anyone else. I keep telling my family that even though we won‚Äôt get sick (bc we‚Äôre all healthy & young) but we still need to take precautions for all the vulnerable people out there who are struggling Way more than we would and they still don‚Äôt care like they act like it‚Äôs not important that these other people in their lives don‚Äôt matter when they do. It‚Äôs just so that sad that people who have privilege never want to extend their privilege and help other people."
BPD,fkj5jkv,t3_fiiflu,1584236763.0,I feel like if I said this to my partner he would be upset by it... saying that he doesn‚Äôt love me enough or something. But this is in fact a genius analogy for bpd
BPD,fkj599c,t1_fkj080g,1584236551.0,EXACTLY!!! I feel that we just see things the way they are. I mean everyone is so ‚Äòcomfortable my and conforming in society so no one questions things or things about the bigger picture of some things.
BPD,fkj549l,t1_fkibtk4,1584236450.0,I understand this but for me also I self harm and abuse myself mentally and verbally for these same reasons but sometimes I always get so angry about the terrible things happening constantly throughout the world and I just want to hurt myself and beat myself down because of all the despair I feel and I can‚Äôt do anything.
BPD,fkj4fnf,t1_fkax771,1584235946.0,"I know this was posted to days ago. But I get it everything and everyone in my life seems to invalidating me. And when that happens I get the urge and usually do it too. 

I don‚Äôt know how to control it, if no one cares about me or believes in me or listens why should I care about myself?

I guess we can try to hold comfort in the fact that we see eachother. I understand that you are struggling in different ways then anyone else could ever understand. Just try to stay strong even in the darkest times ‚ù§Ô∏è"
