pcmasterrace,fr3oy9e,t3_gmc183,1589862426.0,I still haven't made an Epic account and won't.
MangaCollectors,fr3iz03,t1_fr3iva7,1589858425.0,Maybe. For me personally when i speak about volumes i mean volumes and not the book per sey.
MangaCollectors,fr3fs6g,t3_gltnxi,1589856468.0,Probably not. Just the virus is causing everything to go OOS. Many series are out of stock atm.
MangaCollectors,fr3dvow,t1_fr2tr0c,1589855297.0,Monsters is actually 18 volumes. There's 9 2 in 1s.
runescape,fr24cop,t3_gm09t8,1589830938.0,Yeah it's not working. I hope they fix it.
CanadaCoronavirus,fr234vk,t3_gm1md0,1589830340.0,Lol Nope
pcgaming,fr1xcnb,t1_fr1xbkx,1589827523.0,Very true.
pcgaming,fr1wgk5,t3_gm39ku,1589827086.0,The first game remove Denuvo after 6 months. I'm hoping they do that here but i doubt it. They won't be getting my money.
pcgaming,fr1w5du,t3_gm72p7,1589826936.0,They couldn't even be bothered to patch it for ps4 pro. I highly doubt itd come to pc
pcgaming,fr1vpwy,t1_fr1i6u2,1589826740.0,"So far, this game doesn't have Denuvo and probably won't since Activision has never used it IIRC."
CatAdvice,fr1fxyz,t3_glwnt5,1589819042.0,Personalities can definitely change. My cat has FHS and when we moved it made it worse and he changed a bit. I'm sure your cat is just happier though. Maybe the new place is bigger or he just likes it more?
MangaCollectors,fqyrnz6,t1_fqyqw9q,1589753427.0,"Weird. I've never had it reject it for me with any Manga. Sometimes it won't work until I apply the coupon at the very end of checkout, instead of doing it earlier."
MangaCollectors,fqyp719,t1_fqyp4os,1589752264.0,Even after other discounts? I don't know then. Works for me no problem.
MangaCollectors,fqyotkh,t1_fqyor5d,1589752090.0,Is the order 50 dollar or more?
ipad,fqxf9n1,t3_gl6kcf,1589731364.0,"My partner has the 2020 ipad pro which has 6gb of ram, and the ram management is awful. It's just ipad os."
ipad,fqxewa2,t3_gl63xa,1589731180.0,My partner loves the ipad pro for art. Her whole life shes hated wacom tablets and pens and so just stuck to traditional. Got her the ipad pro and now she loves digital art.
MangaCollectors,fqvkzrz,t1_fqvkpi1,1589679515.0,"Yeah i hate them. They let stuff go OOP constantly or they'll drop a series randomly before finishing it. Sometimes pick it up yeeeears later, only to drop it again."
MangaCollectors,fqvichs,t1_fqvi7fs,1589677900.0,"Can't remember. I bought Vinland Saga, Blade of the Immortal, a ton of other stuff. It was huge. Keep in mind the CAD dollar is god awful so. I got 20% off the order too, so technically it was way more. But i only had to spend 760."
MangaCollectors,fqvi5ut,t3_gkzrll,1589677785.0,Dark Horse. Thats all I'll say.
MangaCollectors,fqvi1qw,t3_gkzitl,1589677714.0,760 CAD. Not my proudest moment.
spotify,fqu7pdh,t3_gkujgj,1589653634.0,"If this becomes an update for everyone, I'm finally ditching Spotify."
MangaCollectors,fqtvk1f,t3_gkp705,1589646942.0,"Physical only. I'll never step over to digital tbh. If a series i want goes digital only, i simply won't read it, not even illegally."
ipad,fqsifln,t1_fqsic6b,1589608153.0,5g only matters if you get the cellular version. Which imo is useless unless you're always on the road and need an insanely fast internet connection.
ipad,fqshygt,t3_gkpema,1589607776.0,My partner just got the new 12.9 2020 and loves it. I highly doubt a new model would over shadow it much. These ipads will last 5+ years EASILY.
ipad,fqq5vp7,t3_gk56k9,1589559927.0,I'd buy this is a heartbeat!
pcgaming,fqq4yl2,t1_fqpd9kb,1589559477.0,I cannot remember the monitors that we used. But i know when we compared the Oled iphones to the LCD iphones they looked the same to me.
pcgaming,fqpbym5,t1_fqpbr7z,1589542076.0,I have my eyes checked every year and theyre 20/20 still so idk what's up. I definitely can't tell a difference. I'm the same with resolutions. 1080p vs 4k is pretty hard for me to tell a difference. Yeah it's there but it's tiny imo. Even side by side. I'll sit and look for 20 mins and fail a blind test.
pcgaming,fqpbik7,t1_fqoz2n5,1589541668.0,"So both things you mentioned, especially since i like using monitors for years and years and years. Along with oled smearing, burn in, certain grays are not even across the entire screen. 

Over the passed couple years I've had insane issues with my phones oled. Had the screen replaced twice and it still has issues. Not to mention i personally can't tell a difference between oled and led even side by side."
iphone,fqoscov,t1_fqos8uh,1589523423.0,"My partner works for telus and yeah, noone buys LG. I have a LG G8 for music and love it. And idk why it doesn't work well. It does it across 5 different systems."
iphone,fqos48s,t1_fqos0z0,1589523232.0,"Not every single phone will copy them. LG still has the headphone jack. Quite a few still have it actually. Even if i have to step down to low end phones, i will"
pcgaming,fqon2pu,t3_gjttsf,1589519228.0,"I personally hate OLED. I'm still using 3 monitors that are 7 ish years old and theyre fine enough. I wish i could have a LCD phone screen again, since OLED is awful to me. Hope micro or mini led is good."
iphone,fqocd3t,t3_gju0zh,1589512104.0,"Imo if they don't go USBC, and do decide to go portless. I'll be switching to android. I've never been able to get wireless transfer of my files onto my windows pc to work properly. So if i cant do that, bye bye."
ipad,fqm0f35,t3_gjm208,1589469338.0,"I think it totally depends on what you do. It sounds like an 11 inch is what you'd want. I got my partner the 12.9 inch for drawing, and she actually wishes apple had something like a 16 inch ipad pro max or something. But yeah definitely glad we got the 12.9 over the 11. It's definitely too big for something like ebooks imo though."
battlestations,fqkq896,t1_fqkq2t6,1589433303.0,Windows 10 does it by default...? At least for me.
DigitalArt,fqj1pol,t3_gii0vb,1589403847.0,Att....Attempt??? I'd say it was a success!
pcgaming,fqi8s6z,t1_fqi8lau,1589392476.0,"It's a Steam issue i think. Because Microsoft decided to make each game ""DLC"" Steam says you have to buy MCC. But you don't. You can buy ""Halo 2"" alone if you want. Yeah it's petty dumb i agree"
pcgaming,fqi6mhw,t1_fqi6kxl,1589391263.0,"Yeah but it's actually not. I know it says that, but it's wrong."
pcgaming,fqi4e7j,t1_fqhcq6j,1589389892.0,Actually ODST is in between 2 and 3.
pcgaming,fqi46c3,t1_fqhn7z7,1589389773.0,You can literally buy JUST Halo 2 and not need MCC
pcgaming,fqi44ib,t1_fqi2aqu,1589389744.0,The games are not all out yet. Theyre being released slowly as they develop them. Youre not an idiot. just don't keep up with the news =p
ipad,fqhuk87,t1_fqgmuuy,1589384848.0,Do you remember how many layers you got before the update? Since those numbers are definitely post update. I'm just compiling numbers. I know 11x14 went from 34 to 44 layers. And i have a comments with others. I'm just curious.
MangaCollectors,fqhkvqv,t1_fqhks7z,1589379039.0,"Yeah thats what i said? You get 10% from the plum plus subscription, and 10% from a coupon laying around. So 20% total. You don't have to sign up for retailmenot btw. I don't."
MangaCollectors,fqhkd1g,t1_fqhk4um,1589378731.0,"20% applies to anything in the store. I get my coupons from retailmenot.ca. If you've used that coupon and want another i just use an email generator and get another one right from indigo for ""signing up and getting the newsletter"". It's pretty great. I basically refuse to buy anything unless i get 20% off now."
runescape,fqhj56v,t3_givk9e,1589378044.0,They changed the time? Gg me.
MangaCollectors,fqhik5n,t1_fqgkq8b,1589377714.0,For me personally I always buy from indigo as I always get 20% minimum per order. 10% from my yearly subscription (which is 40 per year) and there's always a 10% coupon laying around. I have gotten 20% off or more on every one of my orders in the past year or so.
pcgaming,fqhgq6g,t1_fqhal6l,1589376639.0,Because i went to bed and literally just woke up? And idk what to edit it to. What do i put?
pcgaming,fqggwt8,t1_fqggv81,1589345972.0,Honestly I'm not a fan of MP in video games. I only play SP.
ipad,fqggkym,t1_fpn3i79,1589345726.0,Procreate got an update that takes advantage of the ram of the 2020 ipad. Procreate definitely has a lot more layers now. Did a before and after test. Just in case you still cared.
pcgaming,fqggh3s,t1_fqggcqg,1589345650.0,"I only played campaign. Which for me, was perfectly fine. Might be why people say it's fine. I never played MP so i cant say in that instance. I admit my ignorance there."
pcgaming,fqgge4s,t1_fqggbsc,1589345592.0,I definitely know i didint have it. I'm extremely sensitive to audio issue's and mine was definitely fine. I might have been lucky then.
pcgaming,fqgg8z7,t1_fqgg3np,1589345487.0,Weird. Maybe just you. It was flawless for me.
ipad,fqgfsrf,t3_gilkqm,1589345159.0,"Did a test before and after the update. 

2388x1668 had 130 layers before, and 164 after.

4000x4000 had 29 before and 37 after 

6000x6000 had 10 before and 14 after 

Pretty awesome if you ask me. Glad I got the 2020 ipad for my partner instead of a 2018 one.

Edit - 11x14 also went from 34 layers up to 44."
pcgaming,fqgbs30,t1_fqga5f5,1589342373.0,The audio was only ever fucked on Reach. CE is fine.
yugioh,fqg1ucb,t3_gif1uv,1589336191.0,"Funny enough Zexal and Sevens are the best shows imo. I hated 5ds, DM and GX are ok and Arc V is just plain bad. Vrains was ok too. Zexal had a ton of great duels."
telus,fqfjyby,t3_gchrwj,1589326249.0,"My partner works with telus, and it's basically cheaper to retain a customer than singing a new one. Surprised it's only 10 bucks. Shes often able to get people waaaay more than that off per month."
pcmasterrace,fqfieai,t3_gicmiv,1589325444.0,I got my 27 inch 1080p monitor 6ish years ago for like 200 CAD. It's been flawless ever since haha.
MangaCollectors,fqeie2m,t1_fqeib5f,1589308059.0,It's hard to tell. Could just be OOS due to the virus. Printing is slowed down or delayed. Guess I'll wait and see.
MangaCollectors,fqe85fl,t3_ghlr26,1589303317.0,Is this manga going out of print? It seems to be out of stock in a lot of places. Looks great.
yugioh,fqdx7xv,t3_ghsvdi,1589298165.0,While i dislike rush duels irl. I absolutely love this show tbh. It's just new and fun. And i thought the CGI is the best of all the shows. I'm confused as to why people dislike it. It fits the show well.
MangaCollectors,fqauinr,t1_fqaufjh,1589225512.0,That's fair.
MangaCollectors,fqau3ik,t1_fqatx9o,1589225304.0,They sell insanely well in French so I'd assume they'd do well in English as well.
GameDeals,fqaiztu,t3_ghhg6q,1589219879.0,Dark souls 2 and 3 are also on sale.
MangaCollectors,fqaf39w,t3_ghqlh3,1589217993.0,It's definitely an expensive hobby. Here in Canada i've spent just under 4000 CAD on manga over the last 2 years.
buildapc,fqa9of7,t3_ghkjad,1589215295.0,"I always have and always will suggest EVGA for their customer service. And overall good products. I have the 2070 Super XC, and it's been amazing."
runescape,fqa5777,t3_ghn5z9,1589213027.0,502 bad gateway....spots were filled in less than a min. Pretty BS. I really wanted in.
buildapc,fq75omh,t3_ggz6u8,1589142119.0,"Because I like using a mouse and keyboard, mods, graphics settings, the ability to easily set up my dac/amp setup for audio, ability for multi monitors and have things on the side while gaming, the ability to choose whatever gamepad i want, the ability to keep using my huuuge steam library, perfect backwards compatibility, theres just so many reasons to stick with PC for me personally."
Amd,fq64649,t3_gh20da,1589124130.0,Happens with my 3600. No matter which power setting i choose.
MangaCollectors,fq2xcwo,t3_gg88yk,1589060961.0,"Yeah it pisses me off March Comes in Like a Lion and Relife don't have an English print yet. Just makes no sense, especially when you look at some of the shit that does."
MangaCollectors,fq2wx2i,t3_ggeq6e,1589060768.0,Indigo Chapters has some in stock now.
MangaCollectors,fq2foxc,t3_gglnfz,1589055691.0,Yup me too. This month I've spent 760 CAD lol. I'm trying to settle down though.

MangaCollectors,fpsn7tu,t1_fpruq9c,1588876324.0,"No i'm pretty sure it's not. People keep repeating this because it's out of stock so often, but it always comes back. I emailed the publisher, and they said it's not going out of print."
Art,fprqgtf,t3_gf0oo2,1588860022.0,This kind of art style is my favourite! Love it.
darksouls3,fprprnf,t3_geoom2,1588859622.0,Wtf. I've had my partner playing through the games. And now 3 is blocked? Guess they wont be playing it now since we aren't buying a second copy now.
MangaCollectors,fpp2bhk,t1_fpp1vic,1588794725.0,"I emailed the publisher and they said it's not going OOP. Cause i was scared of that happening, and emailed them before ordering all of them at once back in December lol"
MangaCollectors,fpoa1oe,t3_gemlkv,1588780964.0,No they aren't. Maybe in the next 2-3 years when the deluxe editions are mostly out. But not currently.
ipad,fpn3g21,t1_fpn2pd7,1588748979.0,Procreate probably isn't updated to take advantage of it yet. I wish we had a 2018 ipad to try other programs that don't limit layers to try. Since they'd simply crash less often. But layers are 100% effected by ram.
ipad,fpn25i3,t1_fpn0vm8,1588747927.0,Pretty sure it's only the amount of layers that are available. Just look up the max amount of layers available on a 4000x4000 project. The 6gb version has extra layers.
MangaCollectors,fplzlvp,t1_fpkh7l2,1588722558.0,Wait Black Butler is OOP? On the site I buy from they have all the volumes in stock.
MangaCollectors,fplzhge,t1_fpichr6,1588722490.0,I don't think Dorohedoro is going out of print. I emailed the publisher and they told me it was not.
MangaCollectors,fplz0lk,t1_fplr7v4,1588722230.0,How come the anime is better? I've been thinking of picking up the entire manga. I've never encountered an instance in my life where the anime is better than the manga. So im curious as to why this one would be.
yugioh,fpljz6d,t3_gdymx9,1588714071.0,Arc V. Just everything. There wasn't a single moment that i enjoyed it.
MangaCollectors,fplgsmx,t3_ge1zbc,1588712438.0,Yeah it's out of print for the singles. The box set has all the volumes in 2 in 1s. Not sure if the box set is out of print or not though. Got mine a long time ago.
Art,fpkzc9o,t3_gdzxj2,1588703649.0,I adore this. Absolutely love this kind of art. Especially the style. This must have taken forever to complete!
yugioh,fpj2s53,t3_gdmqar,1588654991.0,Personally i think all of Arc V is terrible. Especially the first 30 episodes. The whole time watching it i just wanted to stop.
MangaCollectors,fph6b7m,t3_gdg01o,1588615728.0,I have the Indigo yearly membership. I've saved soooooo much money because of it.
MangaCollectors,fph6673,t3_gd705c,1588615657.0,Personally I ONLY get physical copies. I don't do digital at all.
iphone,fpdaesw,t3_fwwmto,1588523097.0,I personally fill 256gb phones really easily. 512gb is about prefect for me. This is all subjective so it's hard to say what you'd need. I'm sure 128gb would be good though.
iphone,fpd9l14,t3_g0adez,1588522626.0,Yeah i cant stand OLED either.

comedynecromancy,fpabp81,t3_ga5lmc,1588444836.0,I prefer the original way more. I don't understand the new at all.

ipad,fp8ndde,t1_fp8nar2,1588397040.0,Oh yeah for sure. But the extra 2gb of ram helps a ton for things like procreate. Obviously for just media consumption there will be no difference.
ipad,fp8hla0,t1_fp8b74y,1588392499.0,The cpu and gpu are a bit better. Also has 6gb of ram instead of 4. Not the same lol
runescape,fp7id1n,t3_gas0fv,1588371181.0,Yup it's been driving me crazy!
