I used to attend festivals on private property and, it was common for people to drop their unwanted dogs there, hoping they would find a home. The property owner does not want those dogs. He has 5 of his own. My dog was one of 2 that we managed to catch. Every other dog was too afraid to come to people. Their fate was animal control at a 7 day kill shelter if they were caught.  The weather had dropped to 18 degrees on one of the nights...

My dog was super happy to meet everyone as we walked around, hoping to find his humans but, he became exhausted by it. When it came to putting him in the car to come home... that was heartbreaking. The last time he was in a car, he was thrown out. It was like wrestling a mental patient to get him into the car.  Imagine all 4 legs spread as wide as possible grabbing the outside of the car. There had been a similar-looking service animal at the event. People who were not aware of the situation had thought I was trying to steal someone's service dog.

As we were driving down the back roads, he got really excited by one house and, focused on it so, I stopped and brought him to the door. The people who answered said he was not theirs and they did not recognize him so, I took him home... He's been my dog ever since. He's my first and, he might be the best dog ever... So many people wanted him but, he's mine and, he's a really good dog... I don't understand what he could have done to deserve being thrown out...

IT sounds like you are dealing with a narcissists Your MIL is bothering you because it entertains her on some level, even if it's subconscious. IF you just let it roll off... Just laugh (INTERNALLY) at how purely ridiculous it is and move on.  It's like a vampire feeding off your frustrations. Learn how to be a teenage girl. Roll your eyes and say ""whatever."" Just ignore her. Don't get frustrated because you expect her to respect your boundaries or, suddenly appreciate you... It's not going to happen.

IF you can do this. Make it clear to her that your office is your office and, when you are in there, you are working. Put a sign on your office door and, lock the door. She'll probably find excuses to try to get in. It's not her room. She needs nothing from inside and, you have made things clear. Get some noise-canceling headphones. Tell your wife, if it's important she can text you.

When you are doing the dishes and, she tells you to do the dishes... Don't be bothered. Laugh (on the inside).  Heck, if you want to have fun with it, and cause drama, just dry your hands and walk away.

Give her the grey wall. No reaction. Take a deep breath. Don't display any frustration. Reply calmly.

Fare warning... This will piss her off. She will begin acting out. Your wife might even not want her around anymore if she can't keep things civil ;)  


Edit: I realize, none of my advice involves asking her to leave. That really does need to be discussed but, your wife feels like she needs the support and, you don't want to remove her perceived support so YOU can feel better. I don't know your wife, her personality, or, her relationship with her mother. Relationships are complicated when narcissists are involved. If getting her to leave is too complicated, I suggest studying the narcissist and, treating your MIL as more of an observational social experiment, than a bother in your life. People like her are everywhere. You might even have one for a boss someday. Learn how to deal with them."

raisedbynarcissists,fp19bqt,t3_gajo4e,1588228177.0,It's a narc thing. They don't even have to be your parents. Have you heard how our president speaks to reporters?
Unemployment,fp18y8h,t3_g66yn6,1588227846.0,Yes. This happened to me. I'm looking for answers.
Unemployment,fp18t0p,t3_g4d88e,1588227721.0,This has happened to me more than once. A representative unlocked my pin manually multiple times. Once I had to submit a new application for benefits.

Stupid? Yes. It is."
Unemployment,fp18dsl,t3_g2nfad,1588227360.0,"I made another post with a vox article. Georgia changed rules and, it's unclear if we are supposed to be filing for yourself or if your employer should be filing on your behalf.

I applied on 3/28. Was paid 4/4 and 4/11 on 4/15 but am getting the message to check the status on my UI for the past 2 weeks.  It says I'm approved and the last time I was paid was 4/15..."

Unemployment,fp17mox,t3_gaq54r,1588226719.0,"I applied on my own. My benefits we're approved and, I was paid out on 4/15 but, have not been paid since. There is no explanation for my payment not processing. I've done everything I need to do. This is not my first unemployment rodeo. I was surprised to find this article. My claim is based on an employer that operates out of California."
AmItheAsshole,fp0un5t,t1_fp0c8a3,1588217302.0,"The talk that follows your reply, about her being shunned... She's already dating a man who is not a JW and, is not pre-approved. Maybe it's not the same as Evangelism or, Orthodox Jew but... Is'nt dating outside of a ""cult"" already a situation that would be shun-worthy? Maybe they aren't that intense... But yeah, her sexuality shouldn't come up. At first, I thought maybe the layer of ""conversion therapy"" would be a plus but... best it just not come up because, she's better off ""dead"" if he couldn't ""put his wife in here place..."""
AmItheAsshole,fp0qgzb,t3_gaetb4,1588214679.0,"NTA BUT, I say, you two read this sub r/raisedbynarcissists and let her make the final decision. She will see stories that hit her where it counts. You will have a better idea of the type of wretched beings you are dealing with. These people are not healthy for your family and, I advise you to be aware of how they treat your child. It is their daughter's baby. Narcissists are not rational people.

No matter what; trying to reduce contact with these people could get UGLY. Your wife is right to be wary of the drama. You don't know these people when your wife stands up for herself.  This may end up as a total NO CONTACT or NC situation. I do not advocate making the decision for your wife but, I do encourage you to make her aware that it is an option and, being supportive of her decision.  


Edit: I like the solid come back option, that shuts down the behavior. I am not aware to what degree that these people are narcissists. Name calling and belittling is one thing. It depends on the severity of the situation. Maybe it's not as intense when there are two parents... I had a very intense single mother. When I started setting personal boundaries, we ended up not talking for 5 years. Well... she still talked. I just didn't respond... until she started to become acquainted with and respect my boundaries..."
Unemployment,fp0pqhn,t1_foz2h7i,1588214227.0,Thank you! Edit: I only see the automatic rejection response. Not sure If it's actually up.
