How about you? Will you be okay after this?"
jeffreestarcosmetics,fkzvrxw,t3_flp14w,1584681906.0,"I feel you! Currently my job hasn't decided to close completely, however, they laid off the part time employees. With my job being a high traffic area, they closed it to the public, however they are having a select few people clean and sanitize the building. 

I'm in Indiana. And all the stories around me are damn near empty of everything, and my landlord has gotten angry already because we asked if we could pay a little later due to us being off for 2 weeks unpaid.

I hope it gets better honey!!"

Make sure to start on joint health while the baby is young! Steps up to couches and beds are a huge help. Also, prepare for your own personal heater! Huge cuddle bugs!

Side note: JRT's can get burnt out in the sun easily! Mine is all white but her face and she burns! So we put infant sunscreen on her!

Good luck! And congratulations🥰❤"

I'm like ""well, you had 137 across, and went to 54 then took it down because someone walked by the table"" its nuts man!
The longest roll I've ever seen is 40 minutes and everyone was up near 200 to 300 on each number..
