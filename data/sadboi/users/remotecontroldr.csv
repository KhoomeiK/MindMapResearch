The10thDentist,fr2abtv,t1_fr28rnx,1589833856.0,"I think you make a good point about the Friends pregnancies. The “girl power” of the 90s was definitely a different vibe than maybe the comparable “women in STEM” now. 

It would have been one thing if BBT set out to make one of the characters jazzed about being a Mom and a scientist, showing the “she can have everything” stuff and making it empowering. Then you have Amy who we already knew wanted children (and based on Young Sheldon VO’s eventually did), I was so hoping she’d be getting a Nobel prize AND a pregnancy, while Penny could still choose to remain child-free. That whole plot was a waste of practically the entire last season. I think that would have been a lot better way to show female empowerment than giving Penny the surprise pregnancy. The stupidest part about it is that they did all this just so they could bookend the stupid “their kids will be smart and beautiful,” joke from the beginning. Complete waste of a plot and disservice to character development.

As far as the gay jokes, I’m mostly referring to the Chandler stuff. You are right they did have pretty good representation with Ross’s ex-wife for those days."

They got away with a lot of things which were probably past the time is was OK to still do it. Most people look back at Friends in disgust about the gay jokes but for some reason people were OK with it in BBT. Was there ever even a gay character portrayed in a positive light on BBT? Penny’s pregnancy at the end was extremely disappointing. They set up two women who wished to be child-free and gave them both the old surprise baby switcheroo. It wouldn’t have even been so bad if Bernadette had originally wanted children. But to do that to both of them? Well, I think we all already know pretty well what Chuck Lorre thinks women are good for. Here Amy and Sheldon, you get a Nobel prize, the failed actress can have an oops baby.

For group, if you answer yes to those questions you must stay after and talk with the facilitator. It’s important to note that a lot of us have suicidal ideations that are intrusive thoughts with no plans or intentions to actually follow through, and some of us have thoughts that may be dangerous to ourselves. I know a lot of people, including myself that always answer no to these for fear of being hospitalized. At my last group before the pandemic we had a long conversation about this and the facilitator made it very clear that it’s OK to say yes and discuss ideation without fear of involuntary hospitalization. Something that wasn’t always clear to everyone in the group. This led to a pretty good discussion about intrusive thoughts and different ways to handle them. (Mostly mindfulness techniques and listening to the thought and acknowledging it doesn’t align with your values and allowing it to pass.) I found this helpful and also found it helpful to learn that just about everyone has terrible intrusive thoughts sometimes. 

So yes, every time I see my psych team I am asked to answer questions about suicidal thoughts. I’ll be honest though, even after the conversation last time I will still answer no because there are just other priorities I have when speaking with my therapist and doctor and I know I will not actually follow through with harming myself."

The controls are a little tight but there are a lot of things about the game I enjoy. Good details like Bart’s cape waving while you’re stationary. Challenging, but not too challenging obstacles. Some of the tiny ledges and moving platforms can be a pain in the beginning and jumping from the narrow ledge to the moving platforms can suck pretty bad if you get out of your groove. 

Decent weapons and they are always pretty readily available, and if you don’t have a weapon you can kick and punch. ([If you get hit, it’s your own fault](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSoJDUD_bU).) Health bars are plentiful and they’re cumulative so if you get more than five and start to take damage you don’t start to lose them immediately. 

I’ve been able to get as far as the blacked out part of the crab lair and I’m still working on it. The game was pretty addictive at first and I keep going back. I hate those green bats though at the end of the first level! But I’ve been able to get them mastered pretty OK now. (Ninja edit to add that shooting the 3 eyed poop emojis to create ice platforms to climb up to the Swamp Hag makes those stupid bats worth it lol.)

I’d like to think I could beat this game one day. As a Simpsons fan I might be biased just being happy to find a game that was actually playable! I have Bart vs. the Space Mutants and haven’t been able to play it at all even after trying several times and watching videos. The only other Simpsons game I own is Bart vs. the World and it just doesn’t really offer as much as Bartman Meets Radioactive Man.

CozyPlaces,fn3m08y,t3_fyzekt,1586623415.0,It’s nice to see one where they understand there are more shapes than just rectangles. And more textures than just smooth. Not enough color or contrast for me. Looks more like an ad for all the products in it than somewhere I’d like to inhabit and get cozy.
