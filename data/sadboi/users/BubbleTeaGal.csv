You won't be the one submitting the letter from my understanding, the person who writes it will be!

buildabear,fokrqm4,t3_g80qsg,1587847683.0,"This is normal. 

On the email and in the website there's a huge banner that says ""Due to increased demand, Please Allow 2-4 weeks for processing"" you'll get charged on your card when it ships, and you'll get a processing email when they process it and a seperate shipment email when it ships. The first charge to your card was a hold and not an actual charge. This is standard with many online companies including Amazon. This message is also on the confirmation email sent by bab for your order in bold. It's been 10 days since the 15th which is less than 2-4 weeks. 

They're getting them out as soon as they can but they're trying to ensure safety of warehouse employees up in Ohio and keep things smooth with other orders too."

Sororities,fojzpkc,t3_g67meq,1587832626.0,"I'm actually pretty worried about this because I'll be helping with recruitment as the only brown poc in my chapter and only person my race. A lot of girls like me didn't go through recruitment, there were only I think 4/~120+ girls at my small school. I'd definitely say to just make sure you have a diverse group of people speak or lead things (don't put them back in the kitchen or coat room etc, make them visible), if they aren't racially diverse at least diverse in interests/campus activities/orgs/majors. That made me feel more welcome because they're still ""different"" if that makes sense. 

I'd also suggest not pairing them up with a person of their race just because it's awkward af when there's only a handful or just one of that group in your chapter. It didn't happen to me but when it does it's weird tbh. 

Also if you use any slideshows or promotional info from your HQ, use some that are diverse, add your own pictures from other chapters if you have to. There's probably plenty of ig pics and vids from other schools or girls that have a more diverse campus look, and yes the girls rushing already know yours may not be the most diverse, but it's much more reassuring to see that the national org on a whole is accepting and welcoming of people in different backgrounds. It's uncomfortable to go to a house that has 0 poc and all of the videos they show also have 0 poc from nationals. 

Even some pics of poc on your campus at philanthropy events can be reassuring, it sounds silly but when you're the only one in a room of 50+ girls and not even a background person of a video looks like you it's uncomfortable. And no not anything overly forced but definitely some images of some friends together or just people participating in the event is fine too. It's a red flag for some of us if it looks like a club doesn't at all interact with any poc even if they aren't members. A lot of these girls won't go in knowing any active members to know who you hang out with or what you do outside of the sorority to know otherwise so that helps."

Sororities,fm7xjzc,t3_ftifrn,1585838806.0,"Mental health is really hard. You're not a professional and you already didn't think she had trouble to begin with. You literally thought it was a joke. For one that's an awful joke, and two you should never assume someone's mental health would be joked about, especially something like a suicide attempt. This is also a stressful time for a lot of people for a variety of reasons, and I'm sure you're stressed too. These are all reasons you 100% should not talk to her about it or bring it up. Let a professional, trained and licensed professional talk to her. Which if she was hospitalized is already happening now. You don't need to do anything other than support her if she asks. If she doesn't, don't bring it up. There's a very strong chance she will not bring it up and won't want to talk about it. And that's fine and good for her. She shouldn't feel pressured to talk about it and made uncomfortable. 

You're not super close friends and she didn't come to you with this information I'd say to leave it and offer kindness if she comes to you or messages you. Just treat her as you normally would when you text or communicate without making it known how it made you feel. She's probably had everyone and their mom messaging her to ask if she's okay or things along those lines. Some people don't want to hear that with everyone especially if they aren't very close friends. 

The last thing someone wants when they feel isolated by their peers is uncomfortable ""forced"" positive messages or sympathy. She'll definitely notice that it wasn't there before and that you guys are obviously only saying it now because someone else shared her struggles to you. It'll make her uncomfortable and probably agitated or stressed, because the only reason people know is there was probably some mass email about it. That's very uncomfortable for a person to go though. 

This is from my experience and I didn't want people I wasn't incredibly close with knowing or talking to me about it. She may be different of course but I'd say not to bring it up unless she does and see where things go from there."
