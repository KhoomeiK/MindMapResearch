PhDCafe,f9ylwb9,t3_e7d5xj,1575730482.0,"A few things. 

A). 3.7 is a good GPA. Mechanical engineering is a tough field. That is something to be proud of!

B). A couple journal articles is also good. It’s a great first start. Your post doc will get you more!

C). Grad school is dehumanizing, so what you’re feeling is (unfortunately) totally normal. You have  achieved something big here. Be proud of yourself!

D). Consider getting into therapy. Im a Ph.D. Candidate and therapy truly changed my life. It helped so much with the imposter syndrome and anxiety. 

And finally... now that you’ve graduated, take some time for yourself. Develop that hobby you denied yourself. Find something that you enjoy, and MAKE time for it, no matter how much work you have to do. For me, that’s running and ceramic art. It really will help!

TL;DR. What you’re feeling is normal. But I’m proud of you and you should feel proud of you too. 😊"

TheLastJedi,f08n65c,t3_d47i1l,1568484060.0,"I chalk it up to a couple things. 

1). As previous people have said, Kylo has been shot by a bowcaster. 

2). Kylo is currently (in TFA) emotionally unhinged after having killed Han and generally just being in an enraged state because of Rey and Finn doing their thing around Starkiller Base. 

3). The Last Jedi kind of implies that Rey is extremely and unusually powerful in the Force because she is the Light equivalent to Kylo, is also extremely and unusually powerful in the (Dark Side of) the Force. 

I know a lot of people complain about Rey being a Mary Sue, but honestly, Rey’s narrative doesn’t bother me at all."

SpanishImmersion,ey0xy9m,t3_cuz601,1566685460.0,"”You deserve someone who is not afraid to admit that they miss you. 

Someone who recognizes that you aren’t perfect, but that treats you like you’re the most valuable resource in the world. 

Someone whose greatest fear is losing you, not as a possession, but rather because of what you mean to them. 

Someone who gives up their heart to you without doubting it. 

That loves you, but also shows it. 

That tells you so with acts, that matter, and that they repeat in small doses again and again. 

That finds beauty in your wrinkles and the lines between your lips, and after coming to know them, falls in love with you in different moments. 

You deserve it.”"
