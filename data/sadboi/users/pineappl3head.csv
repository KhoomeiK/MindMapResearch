I dont really have many memories of childhood before the age of 10 (I'm 24 now) so I dont remember what it was like when I was his age and if she was the same or different because I'm a female"

mentalhealth,fqv3snr,t1_fqv25yz,1589669303.0,"Another one may work but reaching the max dose before switching over is always better as docs  can truly eliminate that antidepressant from working. However, if you've tried a SSRI and a SRNI up to the max dose and they don't help, statistically the next antidepressant wont either and you should be referred to a psychiatrist. 

Now talking from my experience in the uk, that does not happen. GPs will just keep throwing different antidepressants at you unless you exhibit symptoms of bipolar or schizophrenia etc...then they will refer you to the community mental health team. 

After taking an overdose of tablets for the 5th time (not wanting to kill myself, just wanting the pain to go away) a&e did refer me to community mental health only for me to have not have been given the time of day and basically saying I'm not ill enough for me to be under their provision"

mentalhealth,fqv1x0j,t1_fqv1a49,1589668232.0,"It helped me for a while. Improved my libido, I was feeling good for like 2 weeks but then my mood would feel low and the docs kept upping my dose until I was at the max and then changed me over to a different antidepressant. Duloxetine is an SNRI antidepressant. Maybe if you've worked your way up to the max dose switching over to a strong SSRI. Sertraline would be my choice but I'm not a medical Professional. 

Searching withdrawal off duloxetine scared me a lot but honestly it only took me 4 weeks to get off the max dose which is pretty normal for an antidepressant and I had no withdrawal symptoms"

I've come to terms with the complex trauma that I dealt with growing up means that antidepressants will never 100% help me by themselves.

Might be the same for you"
