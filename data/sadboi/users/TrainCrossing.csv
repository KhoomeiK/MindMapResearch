In person
Video call
Phone call
Texting
Email
Snail mail

Don't text me rapid fire text messages if you expect an immediate response... I may be in the middle of something important and cannot give my undivided attention.
At the same time, don't call me unless you want to have a conversation.  Dead air on the phone can be quite annoying.

I think listening to other testimonies will help the most as those feelings tend to subside better when you can share and relate your feelings.

It took me a couple of years to work through mine (as it was my best friend), but I found comfort listening to others share the same experience.

I try very hard to not judge people, but in terms of treating others the way you would like to be treated, to me, it's borderline unforgivable.  I have no use for people that cannot respect another person's feelings.

My guess is they are not honest because they don't want to hurt your feelings.  They justify never talking to you because they are thinking it would hurt you.  In reality, they are only protecting themselves from the responsibility of the situation.  

Honestly, it's ALL on them if they can't be honest.  Regardless of what you may have done, you deserve to know so that you can learn from it.  Anyone depriving you of that has doesn't understand personal growth.  It's just frustating to feel at the end that you have to suffer when it's completely on the other person.

Depending on how 'deep' in love you were in makes a difference.  

I suppose you can take the logical approach and list (like actually write them out) all of the ways you weren't compatible or things that would havevakways bothered you and read it when you feel down.

The emotional approach would be to find something to replace that void that the relationship filled.  Work.  Projects.  Friends.  Hobbies.  Exercise.  Trip.  The more time you spend doing this or these (whichever activities work for you), the easier the revovery.

datingoverforty,fel6vfv,t3_epnnfr,1579215335.0,"Thank you for posting a positive assessment of this sub/reddit.

It's meant quite a bit for me as well as I feel I get a little narrow-minded as my emotions grab hold of the situation at hand.  These sub reddit groups have definitely helped where I couldn't 'see' the other side of the coin.  I definitely appreciate it, even if it's not always what I want to hear.  Quite often the mood I'm reading it in makes a difference too, so that's also helped me stop and try to step back to reread what someone else has written before I get to excited one way or another.

I do want to add that while there are some negative toned comments, I feel that overall the mood is supportive and positive, which I think all of us need from time to time.  That is a definitely a good thing.

My ONLY true frustration is the inability to hear the 'tone' in the comments, but that's just a limitation of writing in general.  Too often, I've made a comment, which was in a joking tone, but the execution wasn't clear enough and was read out of context.  I hate when that happens because most people are here to help or look for help.  I am working on improving my writing though.  At the same time, I suppose my humor is an acquired taste.  :D

I think the knee-jerk reaction is that she's picked him over you, but it might just be the case that she prefers you over this guy and is trying to shut it down.

The honesty is refreshing.  If it were me, I'd play it cool as I find the honesty very important and a good sign.  To me, if the romance isn't there, landing in the friend zone with her might not be a bad thing.  (She probably has friends ... keep your options open.)  

Bottom line, cooler heads always prevail.  If it works out between the two of you, you could always ask what this date with this other guy was all about.  Don't get too emotionally invested right now if you can because that's what leads to hard feelings."

datingoverforty,fe629zl,t1_fdzo0f6,1578880174.0,"Ugh, hate to hear that for you.  Scheduling is difficult in itself, much less the age difference.

I'm feeling that gap, but it kind of makes me feel guilty."
datingoverforty,fe61v3l,t1_fdx87xy,1578879908.0,"I wouldn't say you are heartless for knowing what you want.  :)  I've had a coupe of prospects, but the very young children were a struggle for me.  Kids are wonderful, but some of those experiences feel 'in the rearview mirror' for me."

datingoverforty,fe6118d,t1_fdog04b,1578879384.0,"I know you are getting loads of advice here, but this comment tells me more than the story (which was interesting by the way).

Until you build some self confidence, you are going to over-analyze and try to make sense of everything, which is actually going to complicate your situation.

I think saying that you were playing games is a stretch, you could just as easily say she was.  I will say this, if you ask an adult a question and that person isn't honest, well who is that on?

I actually felt the situation is ironic and an example of how poor communication can lead to misunderstandings.  Chalk it up as a lessoned learned and try not to take the outcome too personally.  Keep building your confidence.  :)  (Knuckles)"
depression,fe3m83m,t3_enfyh1,1578850595.0,"The answer is simple.  Execution is very difficult.

Stop worrying about people liking you.

The depression and anxiety are your excuses not the problems.

It's a mind trap."
NarcissisticAbuse,fe36d60,t3_enmq4d,1578846417.0,"Sounds like you have quite a bit on your mind.  I'm going to start bt simply saying this, everyone has a choice in life.  Everyone has a right to choose what they want to believe.  Coping with someone's will and decisions is one of the hardest lessons to learn.  It's my belief that all you can ever do is to show how much you love someone and tell them how you feel.  They have to do for themselves, otherwise, they'll never learn.  You can choose to carry that burden or not.  :)  (Super big hugs)

I don't feel much of an aura around the narcs in my life honestly.  I suppose if you want an analogy, I feel like they are dementors from Harry Potter.  Oh yeah, they like to portray that they are tough and they love to suck the life out of you, but if you have mastered your petronis, then you can see them for what they are ... dark, empty, and lifeless.  :D. They are constantly looking for good people to drain."
datingoverforty,fdzwry6,t3_end5dc,1578797678.0,"To me, there's ghosting someone and then there's being a bad person.  I know that's an over-simplification and judgmental, but our time is valuable.  Even if you aren't interested, be upfront and honest.  It's just courteous.

But you asked about ghosting.  It's simple, whenever there is an expectation to have contact on a repetitive cycle and that cycle is broken without one side knowing why, that's ghosting.  That could be once a year ... when it stops with no explanation ... ghosting.  

I was ghosted by someone close to me.  Horrible.  Possibly the worst thing one could do in a relationship.  I have zero respect for people who do that.  (Sorry, still hard to think about it.)"
datingoverforty,fdzv9mq,t1_fdznwze,1578796619.0,Completely agree.  Could also be a sign that he's a tad overconfident.  Clean your room Bro!  It's just a common respect for your date.
datingoverforty,fdzuuei,t3_enet24,1578796329.0,"Happy to hear that you went through with it.  (Always better to know isn't it? :) )

I wanted to chime in on the bedroom.  As a man, I can say that the house can be a little untidy, but the bedroom?  Uh, no.  That's either weird or your standard for clean is a little high.  That being said, I personally prefer a spotless bedroom, so I am sympathetic if it's the latter.  ;)

Good luck on the next phase!  :)  Enjoyed the update!"
datingoverforty,fdx2j9x,t1_fdlyemy,1578764632.0,"How often did you text/chat/call during the three date window?  To me, the conversation helps indicate where the relationship is at.  Are you their friend or interest?  Huge difference."
dating_advice,fdnt3br,t1_fdns5yy,1578592283.0,"Thank you for your input.  I suppose it's more of trying to understand the behavior and proper response to the situation.  Like I said, I understand about space and allowing time for these moments to settle, but any attempts to rectify the tension only seems to amplify it.  I'm obviously doing it wrong.  :D"

NarcissisticAbuse,fdh5uir,t3_elce75,1578416026.0,"No, you're not alone.  The longer I've been a part of this group, the more I've trended away from the gender factor.  The effects of narcissistic behavior are similar for everyone, so the support and advice is typically gender neutral.

I've also wanted to not seem like I was attacking women in general.  Just because I may have a bad experience, that doesn't mean that all women behave or act that way.  (In fact, I think I have a rare case.)  I would go so far to say that the women in this group are very supportive and have offered me the best advice.  (No, I'm not sucking up here.  I love statistics and that is simply a fact.)

But I get it man, it's always better to feel 'not alone.'  :D  Don't be discouraged, just keep reaching out.   You'll end up building yourself a nice support group!  (Knuckles)"
datingoverforty,fdg1mh5,t1_fdfz4pc,1578376706.0,"I agree, but she's paranoid that her snoring that may lose what she has.  While my personal approach would be different, I only hoped that something I said would help find a solution for now.  

Everything is better if it's organic.  :D"
