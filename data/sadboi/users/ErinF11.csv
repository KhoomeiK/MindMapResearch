I'm so incredibly sorry that your friend died. It's terribly unfortunate.

I made a fake scar on my leg not to get attention, but to use it as an alternative to self harming. I sure did not want anyone I knew to see it, because I hate attention. 

I'll pray for you and your friend. I hope you're doing well and being the best you you can be. Have a nice day. 🥰"

I was in a children's hospital (I was 14 and still am) for a suicide attempt. The man (therapist? social worker? We'll just call him ""the man"") was talking to me and my mom. He asked to see my wrists. I thought that was a weird thing to ask, but okay. He then looked puzzled and said that my records say I used to self harm. He asks if I have cuts anywhere. NEWSFLASH ASSHOLE, self harm is not just cuts! Anyway, I say yes and show him the scars on my inner calves. ASSFLASH NEWSHOLE, self harm can be anywhere, not just wrists!!

Umm, excuse me? You're supposed to be the professional here. 

And you're sitting in front of me and assuming that I cut on my wrists? 

For all you know, I could burn the bottoms of my feet to self harm. I could punch my vagina. I could scratch my ears. I could bite my cheeks. IT. DOESN'T. MATTER! 

And you're sitting here in front of me, showing me and my mother and my current nurse that you don't know anything about self harm. You don't know JACK. SHIT.

You are sitting here in front of me, showing me and my mother and my current nurse that the ""education"" you received about self harm was just myths and stereotypes you got from your angsty emo teenage sister.

Breathe a multiple of four times. Do simple little hand motions in multiples of four. I had incredibly severe OCD. 

It was absolute hell. I tried to stop, but the feeling of not doing something four times was indescribably excruciating. Even worse than the guilty, disgusting feeling I had when I gave in and did it four times. 

What I needed was a therapist who could talk with me. A medical professional who could diagnose me. A psychiatrist who could prescribe me meds. 

I needed that extra push, that encouraging professional reassurance that made me want to get the hell on with my life and be a normal person. 

Please, tell someone. Get help. Even if it's just telling a random stranger you'll never talk to again. You need to get these toxic feelings out. 

You need a therapist. Set up a go fund me or something. Or get financial help from someone close to you. They want you to be happy, trust me. You need someone to explain to you what's happening in your brain. Someone to guide you through the process of getting better.
