The alien is the most poorly rendered element (because it moves so fast) but that doesn’t matter in the least. It is so fully integrated an experience you really get lost in the Alien universe. I often had vivid memories of the locations, corridors. It is truly a world you live in. 

Such a strange feeling to experience genuine terror - violent death - pumping adrenaline. I would often remove the headset and just look around the room to remind myself that I’m safe. 

** spoiler **

Best bonus of the game is you get to relive the experience of discovering the original derelict ship - almost as if you’re with Kane, Lambert and Dallas. It’s probably the closest a VR game has ever come to putting you directly in a beloved classic movie experience."

BostonU,fj055io,t3_faolqb,1582889469.0,"I agree there’s a lot of truth to this. All anxious people need to look inward to improving themselves, finding the things that will give them peace, finding inner strength, getting comfortable with themselves, gaining confidence in all of that. Then they can be fully equipped for life. And then other people will more likely gravitate to them.

But I also think it’s a constant process. Opening up to other people (being ready to find them) can lead to great things."

I’m sure you know, high school - and sometimes even college - are not necessarily the best measuring sticks for success. But now you have a new chance to work hard and prove your worth. For now, relax and bask in the feeling of relief."

From now on, when you meet someone new, use your new adult radar to scan them for ‘good person’ vibes.  Trust your gut and remember that you can find the best people in unlikely places.  So cast your net wide.  I promise you there are so many good people out there - trust that you will eventually find them."
