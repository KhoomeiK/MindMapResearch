Hitler is bad.

I thought this was a popular opinion but [this post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) here proves otherwise. But I think Hitler is bad because he literally started a war. Blame whoever you want, but it was Hitler. He rose to power and then invaded Poland. What did Poland do to him? What's worse is that this literally started a fucking war.

Another reason I think Hitler is bad is because of the Holocaust. He literally captured millions of people, mostly Jews, and kept them in terrible conditions untill he gassed them. That's just fucking cruel.

But the main reason I think Hitler is bad is because of the swastika. The swastika already stood for something, I think peace but I'm not sure. And it looked pretty cool, but now it's ruined because you can't look at a swastika without thinking of Nazi propaganda. Fuck you Hitler, you ruined a perfectly good symbol.
