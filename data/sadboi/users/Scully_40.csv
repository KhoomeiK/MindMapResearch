If you can find a wildlife rehabilitation center near you that would be ideal. It's a huge commitment to take care of these babies, and it's exhausting as shit. There are probably places still open and accepting animals. I actually, just dropped off baby opossums the other day at a rehab center, and they didn't even ask me if I had any symptoms of covid-19. Probably not super responsible of them, but it's good to know there are places still taking in animals despite the situation. 

The most important thing you can do right now is keep it warm. Do you have a heating pad? If not, you can use a warm water bottle wrapped in a sock for it to snuggle up against. If you can get your hands on some pedialyte, dilute it with water (look up the ratio) and feed it to him with an eye dropper or tiny paintbrush. Those creek valley critter videos will show you how. There are also alternatives to the formula you ordered that you can make at home. The mouse ranch website has some good options. Good luck and keep me updated!"
DiagnoseMe,fnhmuoa,t3_g1port,1586965274.0,"Sensory Processing Disorder? (Not a doctor)

Find a psychologist first, then a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists tend to throw meds at you and hope for a reduction in symptoms. Psychologists (good ones) will really listen to you and try to figure out what exactly is going on. They'll help you figure out a treatment plan and will refer you to a psychiatrist they trust. Much easier than finding a good psychiatrist on your own (I've seen 6 psychiatrists, and only one was good... then they moved! ðŸ˜­) Good luck!"

I guess if their belly looks full, but they haven't eaten in a while, it could be bloat, but I don't know, I'm not a professional lol. I've just found myself in your shoes a couple of times.

Some people say to remove the buck before she even goes into labor... well, too late for that. Others say removing him might stress out the mother, leading her to kill her babies. I also read that I should remove him after they're born so that he doesn't try to mate with her immediately, causing her to get pregnant again, which is too much for her body. What do you think?"
