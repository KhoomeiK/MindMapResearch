Look, I'm no lawyer, but if I were suing this woman for what you're suing her for, there's a couple things I'd wanna do:

- Photos of the stains where the bunnies sleep. Prove that they tracked it in after they were exposed to her weedicide.

- Some sort of autopsy that proves your bunnies died (again, I'm so sorry you're going through this,) because of the weedicide she sprayed. If you get these first two you got an easy case for emotional damages and compensation for veterinary bills.

- An admission of guilt on her behalf that she did indeed spray weedicide in your backyard *without your permission.* Again, not a lawyer, but this is a double whammy that if you didn't give her permission to spray weedicide in your backyard, she probably entered your backyard without permission to do it and you have a strong case for criminal trespassing. Obviously that's gonna be hard but to my knowledge she would not be able to lie and say she didn't do that in a court of law.

Please don't listen to whoever is telling you not to bring a lawsuit or criminal charges against this woman, she crossed the line so badly here, beyond making an honest or innocent mistake and she needs to be held accountable for breaking the law and causing such an awful tragedy because of her selfish, narcissistic behavior."

Biden has unveiled nothing even close to Bernie's campaign in any way that matters. He's not going to legalize marijuana even though it would be a slam dunk policy, he's not trying to overturn *Citizens United,* and he's using his fake-ass public option as a proverbial strawman that's meant to fail and help prop up his buddies in the healthcare industry and insurance companies who stand to lose their entire industry under Medicare For All. He's not adopting the things that made Bernie's platform the foundation of the progressive movement. And when he loses, like us Sanders supporters said loooooonnnnnnggggg ago, you're gonna be back to square one trying to push democratic socialism with Donald Trump in office, and you can't blame us when all your struggles are in vain because we said this would happen if Biden was given the nomination over Bernie, and not because of Sanders supporters abstaining or voting 3rd party, but because Joe Biden will not win over the undecided voters or the recurring ~65% that never votes anyways, but the Democrats refuse to learn anything and they refuse to truly embrace the change the people want. That's why I'm not gonna bother. All your effort will be for nothing because they won't let you win. They don't even fucking care about letting people decide who the candidate is because they've argued in court that they don't have to let your vote decide the nominee, they can just pick them in their meetings behind closed doors.

The time for compromise is over. We have been forced to take one for the team every 4 fuckin' years. Told that *this* election is too important to vote 3rd party or not participate in. Told we need to just elect the lesser of two evils and slowly lower the bar for presidential material each and every election, till it got us here. Now's the time to teach the lesser of two evils that if it no longer likes being classified as evil, we have a list of policies we want championed and not meeting that criteria means you won't get our vote. Either give the people what they want or get out of the way. It keeps politicians in line when we hold them to a standard. If you show them you can always be scared into voting, they'll use the power of fear against you every time.

You place this importance in a delusional media that learned fuck all about 2016, and you know what they say about those who fail to learn from history. They called Obama's supporters in 2008 Obama Bros too, they'll throw anything at the wall and see what sticks.

As for Joe being a better choice than Trump, I can tell you for a fact that Joe Biden has fucked me harder on student loans than Donald Trump has. Biden made it the law that you cannot declare bankruptcy on student loans, chaining millions of college graduates to a debt many will carry for their entire life. That alone is reason enough to not vote for him. I've been laboring to explain that candidates are not worth supporting when they pull shit like that because it's a great indicator that they're a lying sack of shit you can't trust as far as you can throw them.

>You’re so delusional on how socialism should be achieved that you’d rather help a fascist stay in power than bother to vote.

And there we have it ladies and gentlemen, it took a while, but we finally got to the ""if you don't vote for Not Donald Trump, you're basically voting for Donald Trump"" card. Oooh boy I fuckin' despise this train of thought. First off, I live in Chicago, what the fuck kinda difference would my vote ever make? The only thing that would ever flip Illinois is Jesus H. Christ himself registering as a Republican. Second, and I hate explaining this part the most, when you don't vote, you are not adding or subtracting from the total of either candidate. It's kindergarten-level math these people come at non-voters with and they get it wrong every time because 0 has never, does not now, and never will equal 1. Third, the Electoral College determines the president, not every individual vote.

I think the one thing, more than anything else, anyone willing to vote for Biden just to beat Trump has to ask themselves if after trading one dysfunctional leader for another is, do the ends justify the means?"

Biden's concessions, if you can even call them that, don't go nearly far enough. It's his way of saying he's done his part and Bernie's supporters better vote for him now after doing so very much for them (also /s for the last part, Joe has done fuck all for Bernie's supporters.)"

It's the same thing with Clinton: she had spent the whole campaign fighting against Sanders' platform and then in a pathetic attempt to save face she started saying she supported most of his platform. It didn't work then, and it won't work now.

I could care less about those idiots misplacing the blame and learning nothing like last time. They're all rushing around, freaking out and getting outraged about everything while I take a look at the political landscape and just shrug my shoulders, knowing how deep the pile of shit is, but also knowing damn that the lesser of two evils will not acknowledge the sensible solution and is committed to making sure the sensible solution is never a choice. That's why I'm not getting involved anymore. If anyone of good moral standing should run, the powers that be won't let them win anyway.

I just don't believe in the concept of anti-voting, where you're not so much choosing what you like but choosing the only alternative to what you really dislike, whether that alternative is good or not. In this case, Joe is not good, and he is not worth voting for out of fear of Donald Trump winning a second term, because make no mistake, he's winning a second term, and you can thank the Democrats when that happens, because they would rather lose to him than let a good man change them for the better."
OurPresident,fp41drk,t1_fp3z9lr,1588289777.0,"Well we keep trying to change it from the inside and they keep unilaterally putting all their effort into stopping that from happening because we keep voting for Bernie Sanders to show the Democratic Party just what kind of change we want to see, and they don't like what we wanna see. So they rig the election. This much was proven in the 2016 election in the e-mails of John Podesta et al. Now they're straight-up cancelling the election in New York, which is ironic because the Democrats were the ones saying Trump was gonna cancel the election because he's allegedly a dictator and he's destroying Democracy, when the Democrats are the ones doing it.

Even if they're only marginally better than Republicans, the turd that doesn't smell the worst isn't a fragrance I want lingering for the next 4 years. I'm amazed how many people think they *have to* choose at all. You don't have to play the game if the teams aren't right. What I see is one party that is hell-bent on destroying this world and another that is all-too-often complicit in the former's goal. The Patriot Act, War on Drugs, Wall Street bailouts, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syrian wars/never-ending military campaigns, private prisons, and more could not go on without the complacency and even support of the Democrats. It was the Democrats who stood by when the Bush campaign claimed a victory they did not win. It was Democrats who allowed the unconstitutional extrajudicial killings of American citizens abroad. It was Democrats who said nothing when the CIA started violating the constitution by torturing prisoners and not even giving them a trial at a facility they promised they would close. It was a Democrat president who dropped a record number of bombs on schools and hospitals in other countries.

That is not only a party not worth changing, it is a party not worth saving. Let them fail again like they did in 2016. I heard they're dragging Hillary Clinton out again to campaign for Joe, so I guess they're speed-running their inevitable loss this time."

Staples,fovzwee,t1_fovsvzq,1588110470.0,"So you can negotiate a pay raise and hazard pay along with other benefits that Staples isn't offering, dumbass."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fovo8we,t3_g9lftm,1588104673.0,"That is correct, sir. Excellent post. I hereby declare this man the winner of this sub."
Staples,fovmwup,t3_g9p6t1,1588104020.0,We need to unionize.
Doom,forhms4,t1_fom16am,1588012384.0,"You know what? I just remembered that the TV I play on has a fucked up left speaker. Lol it's been like that for years now too, it slipped my mind that that's probably why the soundtrack sounded super weak compared to the Doom 2016 soundtrack, a game I played on my college roommate's TV that had perfectly functioning speakers.

That would explain everything."
Doom,fom0pc0,t3_g83uwl,1587875167.0,"I knew from the first time that I played Doom Eternal that the soundtrack was off, that it didn't sound as good as Doom 2016. Mick's comments definitely confirmed that for me, I knew it couldn't have just been me, it sounded lackluster compared to the other game and I knew that he was better than that, that they must've been under utilizing his work. I'm sure his version would sound much better."
MadeMeSmile,folqjgq,t3_fzp50d,1587868131.0,"Nah this one hurt to watch. I lost my grandma to Alzheimers and she never had a moment like this. As soon as her memory started fading it never came back. The only silver lining is that I was kinda too young to have ever really known her before she had Alzheimers. When my other grandparents go, I'm gonna be fucking ruined."

Guitar,folm0z2,t3_g7s7u0,1587865168.0,"They really think the solo for Johnny B. Goode is that... good? Look I get it was insanely influential to the point that that song changed pop culture forever, but A Birth of a Nation isn't like the 12th best film of all time, or even better than Animal House or Goodfellas."
Staples,follf90,t3_g7u0v8,1587864780.0,"It's because the smart people are staying home. All the fuckin' retards come out to Staples and complain that they don't know THEIR OWN GODDAMN PASSWORD FOR THEIR CERTIFICATION FILES THEY WANT PRINTED AT 5""x7"" WHEN IT ISN'T FUCKING SIZED FOR 8.5""x11"" SO IT WON'T REDUCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PROPORTIONAL TO 5""x7"" AND WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR FUCKING CERTIFICATION AND YOUR FUCKING FRAMES WHEN NO ONE IS GOING TO SEE IT WHILE EVERYONE WORKS FROM HOME YOU FUCKING TWAT."
Staples,foixbgs,t3_g7mcon,1587800202.0,"Not to shit on my fellow worker, but why are Hot Topic employees – who work for a company owned by our parent company – getting paid more than me while they get to sit their ass at home and I go to work every day wondering if I'm going to get someone in my family sick? Save the extra pay for the people who are actually working."
eldertrees,fog9n9n,t3_g7aiju,1587749751.0,Mu recommendation is to invest in a pen that let's you just put some dabs on a coil and just buy dabs instead of vaping those bullshit carts. It's worth the money to have some real weed and not whatever the fuck is in those shitty yellow sludge things.
SuicideWatch,fobq9ay,t3_g6fbu3,1587662488.0,"I think what they're trying to say is that when you're really seriously about to kill yourself, holding a gun to your head with your finger on the trigger, or standing on a ledge or wearing a noose around your neck, it's because of a specific incident that's driving you to that decision. Suicide is an impulsive decision that is almost always made due to a recent crisis in one's life.

That's why those people say that to you. You don't really hate them, you're in the middle of an episode and it's impairing your judgement. One bad day is all it takes to send a suicidal person to seriously contemplate suicide; if you get through today you stand a better chance of beating this thing, because every day you can get through will make it all a little easier when other hardships arise. You will be better equipped to handle them once you're going through the motions. Just hang on and please don't let go."
