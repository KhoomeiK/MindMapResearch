datingoverthirty,fnplhcc,t3_g329nm,1587147590.0,"I would focus on you. People are not going to be as responsive right now. I can barely get together with a guy I’ve been seeing exclusively for a couple months. People are so stressed right now because of how intense this is. And it’s very difficult for people who haven’t already been living together to continue a normal relationship other than texts, calls, FaceTime and getting together but keeping some distance if you’re paranoid. We may decide to just quarantine together and risk being a-symptomatic carriers. But we’re trying to be considerate and cautious. It’s also just a different and new scenario that people don’t totally know how to navigate when you’re still getting to know someone. 

So if that’s how it is for newer couples or people dating in person before this happened and gained momentum right before it happened I can’t imagine how hard it would be meeting people online and keeping any sort of momentum going. If I hadn’t of met this guy, and I was still 100 percent single I might try talk to people online for video dates but I have a feeling it would go just as you’ve said and even if I made some video dates or connections they’d fizzle fast, because digital dating is even hard for people with an existing relationship.

So I myself would probably give it up until all this goes back to normal.  I also wouldn’t have dating on my brain as top priority to be honest. The only reason it still is right now is because I really like this guy a lot and id hate to lose him because of this and he feels the same way. But things almost ended because of this whole thing honestly. But if I were single I’d just say ah Eff it, I have a million other things to worry about honestly.

Good luck to you! I don’t think it’s worth the stress."

dawsonscreek,fnbfiab,t1_fnb0r5c,1586814621.0,"Agreed. 

My favorite seasons are 1, 3 and 4. 

2 is ok, kind of boring. Andi saved it for me. 5 has some ok moments. The second half of 6 is far better than first half. The first half of 6 is super annoying and difficult for me. Feels the least like Dawson’s Creek than ever before, even worse than beginning of Season 5. I do try and forget the Tamara thing even happened. And I like to imagine my own first meeting after Pacey being gone at sea of Joey and Pacey in season 5 —as they put little to no effort into that, which deserved a ton of attention."
dawsonscreek,fnbenzc,t3_g0dhpr,1586814189.0,"Season 3 is my favorite. 

Jen is my favorite character and I’m here to say as a loyal and loving Jen fan, for some reason, the writers continue to screw Jen over basically throughout the rest of the series. I love the show and I stuck with it, even when it sucks. Even though they never give Jen what she deserves, and she never gets credit from really anyone (except maybe Jack) for being consistently the kindest, wisest, most selfless person. The trio consistently blows her off and makes her feel like an outsider and never returns the kindness she gives them since day 1. I have no idea if the writers just didn’t realize that or if they did it deliberately for some reason. But Jen is the most underrated character in many ways. But especially on the show as the other characters just take her for granted time after time after time. And yes she does get screwed over by many others as well not even in the circle of friends. Like Drew. 

But yeah if you’re not one for MANUFACTURED drama maybe stop watching lol. (Honestly the worst manufactured drama for me was the demise of Pacey and Joey and their entire breakup in season 3.) Talk about rushing a makes no sense breakup down our throats for the sake of breaking them up. That doesn’t exactly get any better throughout the rest of the show. I never gave up on the show and had to see it through til the end and there’s some really good moments and some awful ones. It’s a rollercoaster. I could gripe about the show for hours but also talk to other fans and gush about it for hours. It’s a love/hate thing 🤷🏻‍♀️ but mostly love."

Guys who aren’t in the best shape but INSIST their girl must be! I’m in super good shape but you need to not insist it of me and say all the time how hot you think it is when you could probably stand to tone up or lose 10 lbs

Guys that think they’re **super** interesting just because they


Travel 

Read books

Cook

Are “total nerds” for liking fantasy (more just GOT not being actual fantasy nerds) 

Guys we all like travel and books are fantastic, cooking is ok? But none of this makes you a man of the world. Pleased don’t go on and on and on about it all especially if that is really all you’ve done culture wise. It just makes you seem very boring and basic and desperate. Or arrogant for literally no reason at all. Yes I’ve been out of the country many times as well, I’ve read many books, I also like interesting kinds of whiskey or wine, and I used to be an actual final fantasy, chrono trigger loving video game nerd so don’t push your GOT “nerdiness” on me. It’s not nerdy. It’s basic AF. And all humans cook!! If you cook well, that’s effin great dude let’s cook together. Please stop bragging about it, as if it makes you the biggest catch of the century.


Guys who don’t like girls that are funny they just want girls to think THEYRE funny

Guys who have zero idea what foreplay is, where the clitoris is, but think they’re incredibly good in bed

Guys who have zero sense of style. Look you do not have to love fashion. In fact I’m not into the metero thing. But wearing shirts you’ve had since college, with jeans that don’t fit and sneakers all the time? You look like you live in your moms basement.

Guys who are super impatient And irritable all the time and seem to only calm down once they have a few beers. That is borderline alcoholism. Or is entirely. Should get that under control. It’s very unattractive.

Guys who smoke cigarettes or vape or think vaping is cool

Male actors or musicians (not all but most) ugh.......

Guys who can’t NOT be flirty and sexual the entire damn time you’re together. Yeah it’s super fun to be sexual and flirty a lot. But can we have a real conversation now? They claim this isn’t how they are once more serious. Ok I’ve given you two months and I barely know you. And you barely know me. I’ve realized these men have sex addiction and when around women all they want and need is flirtatiousness and sex or foreplay or talk about sex. Go to therapy

Guys who turn into toddlers when it comes to simple communication. They just can’t communicate. It’s highly highly unattractive 

Guys who think they’re funny but only have locker room humor

And finally guys who are so insecure that they put you down as a way of flirting. (?) again hit up therapy.

Guys love to call women crazy. And yes, we are. But so are you. You have issues upon issues upon issues. You just aren’t as loud about them. So get off your high horses and do some self improvement of your own for once. Women have tried to change for you for centuries but you guys never think you have to. Well ya do!

And yes I’m sure you can make a list of annoying borderline unhealthy traits a lot of women have too. So to males reading this please don’t take immediate offense. Make your own list that is totally fine. It’s ok to be annoyed by consistent crap like this you find in our gender—and ok to have certain standards. If this list pissed you off reach down deep. It’s not me having my own annoyances I’ve gathered over almost 10 years of dating."

EnneagramType4,fmqx3bu,t3_fwl1em,1586308946.0,"I have like a million personalities for my mood or who I’m around either due to social anxiety I developed or just maybe not feeling comfortable around certain people. I have a “work” personality, “at the store cashier” personality and so on. 

I think I was my true self around my dad. But he passed away. He was the only one I could truly just be myself with. I can get close to that with certain people like my mom or good friends. Most of the time I realize I’m totally not being my *true* self. And I almost forget what it is until it just happens or I’m just around myself and in an ok or good mood. I talk to myself out loud or not all the time when I’m alone and my sarcastic and silly self comes out. But overall, out loud with others... I have no effing idea who I am anymore. It’s a little scary sometimes :/ I don’t actively try and find it though. I find it better to happen naturally. As a 4w5 it’s bad to get too in my head about it. About anything.

The real me I believe is: sarcastic, silly, witty, positive, sometimes giddy, theatrical (was a theater kid for years and years and into adulthood) talkative, kind, charming, inquisitive, compassionate, and I have a nervous energy that calms down after awhile. If I have a couple drinks I’m like a toned down version of all of that. When I feel totally at ease with someone I’ve noticed I don’t use a high pitched voice really. At all. And I talk a lot slower, and I’m funnier and quicker on my feet. I’m more of a calming but extroverted presence at the same time, who has weird but charming quirky and bubbly giddy moments. Whereas if I’m not comfortable I talk in a weird more feminine high pitched voice, can’t think of funny quips as fast, and basically stay more quiet or get too in my head. Overthink everything I want to say so end up saying barely anything or not being articulate. Probably come off bitchy, shy, meek, or seemingly having a dry sarcasm people could find negative because I don’t use it confidently. I don’t display real confidence around people I feel strange around. I can fake it any damn time but it’s not real and I’m sure sometimes it comes off that way.

But I’m both extroverted and introverted so the true me really is both. I’m also a Gemini so try all that confusion on for size. No wonder it’s so freakin hard. Also having anxiety, being a damn 4w5 and developing social anxiety as I got older I mean Jesus. Is it even possible to always feel my true self?? Lol"

If you can’t give two tries and genuinely listen to their explanation and if the explanation seems genuine— thats your own mad insecurities getting in the way of a possible connection. That person may have really wanted to meet you but because you were THAT pissed or insecure two times— you ruined it. Not them. 

If it happens three times that is then a question mark and the explanations could possibly be utter BS and even if they aren’t then yes that’s a waste of your time and they are not respecting you and proving to be too flaky anyways. Or seeing too many other people. 

But once? Come on dude. I thank god certain guys have given me two times to possibly flake for *legit* reasons before bolting because some people really are that busy or really do have life circumstances or can be nervous or what the hell ever, then when we meet we have an amazing connection. I try not to, and I try be respectful but it happens. Doesn’t mean I’m trying to be an asshole. Doesn’t mean I’m not interested. 

I actually tend to give people 3 reschedules or 3 times to not be as responsive and to explain. If the third time I’m not buying it I’m done.

dating,fm9dosl,t3_ftrzf6,1585866628.0,"Your consistent attitude of insecurity is far more unattractive than your outer shell. (I looked at both pictures) but also read a lot of your responses to people. Sometimes there is nothing more unattractive than someone being genuinely complimented by many people and the person *Still* saying “I doubt it”......”you’re the third person to ever say that”......”well thanks but yeah no one in my life has ever said that”

When someone keeps pushing the insecurities even after being given the truth of honesty, THAT is unattractive. It’s something that also pushes people away. It comes off as you are literally impenetrable and any genuine kindness will not go through. OR you are now milking it for more compliments or trying to seem overly modest. 

And maybe you really genuinely just respond that way because compliments mean nothing in the end— to which I ask, why post in the first place? Why continue showing people pics, possibly knowing they’ll say something kind and still basically refute it? 

I am really sorry you had a hard childhood with such an asshole as a caregiver that tried to hurt you on purpose. And an ex girlfriend who said something so shallow and mean on her way out of the relationship. I am not tying to invalidate what you’ve been through and why it’s hard for you to probably even get compliments. However there comes a time when you really need to dig deep, and also grow up a little. And try harder to move on past the bad memories and things that caused pain— and allow yourself to believe a different story. With that comes confidence, with confidence comes social skills, with social skills can come a whole new life. Where you don’t have as much trouble meeting someone and you have friends. But no one will want to date someone who throws compliments away over and over and over. It’s unattractive. And no one wants to date someone who shows their insecurities in such a huge way. Unless they do the same thing and then you’re just in a toxic relationship. 

Please try and take these honest words as trying to help. Please take them seriously. Please either don’t respond or respond with JUST a “ok cool, I’ll consider this. Thanks.” Or even a “screw you, you don’t know me” but for the love of god don’t respond with “well everyone in my life called me this and that there’s reasons I can’t take compliments and so far they’ve been right so I guess that’s why I’m like that, I’ll probably suck at it but yeah I suppose I’ll try anyways!” Because that is already a step in the wrong direction. No excuses, no victimizing yourself anymore, no letting anyone walk all over you either. There are ways to be attractive as a person, that have nothing to do with your looks or even a sense of humor or conversation skills. If you act like a doormat you will be treated like one. And also people will grow tired of trying to help, and you can’t blame people for giving up if you
continue to make it nearly impossible for someone to help. If you’re actively trying to push people away, then therapy should be something you actively pursue and take seriously."

datingoverthirty,fm8xj8v,t3_ftmfuh,1585857866.0,"Stop texting the ex. He’s not going to take your future anywhere. New guy, or some other guy will. Texting the ex is just going to add problems to your life.

Listen to what you’re saying- should you tell your new guy that your ex (who you’re never getting back with, a man who let you go once and is not asking to be with you now) that you still txt and see if that potentially ruins a new potential romance so you can keep this other person in a text box forever? Or let that go completely to truly move on and live your life fully with a man who will show up every single day for YOU and your relationship? There’s no contest, unless you feel your ex is giving some sort of weird hope of rekindling things, what is the value of your “relationship” which doesn’t even sound like a full on friendship? What does it truly add to your life other than being a constant reminder you do wish it worked but it’s not going to? 

I’m over my ex fiancé. We broke up FOREVER AGO. Like 7 years ago now. But to be 💯 percent honest I haven’t necessarily felt something with any new relationship like I did with him. Maybe I never will. I met him at a time in my life when I was very very happy, young and naive. Had really zero serious relationship experience. Was hardly jaded by life yet still gone through a lot. Feelings for someone can also be stronger by life circumstances. I get a sense every person will have someone that “got away.” There’s always going to be one person you just feel so strongly for and have incredible chemistry with. Some people stay with that person forever and others part with that person. It is what it is. I miss him sometimes and wish I could be in contact with him sometimes. But that wouldn’t do anything. He’s married now and I’m still searching for my future person. And I’d rather never speak to him again and continue my search then have him as a pretty pointless texting buddy. He might miss me sometimes too. Not to be arrogant but I don’t see how sometimes, even if just for a brief moment he doesn’t miss me, and think “wow, that chemistry definitely was special. We really did laugh together like no one else” I don’t know what his thoughts would be but when you really someone they leave a print on your heart. Even if it gets smaller over time. Even if he’s sublimely happy with his wife, and I am sure he is. But we would never have gotten back together. He’s moved on. I’ve moved on. We would never and should never text. What would be the point?

Allow yourself to fully move on (I know you have but you know what I mean) fully move on as in go no contact, so you can truly focus on this new person. Find your happiness without him. If he doesn’t want you- it’s over. And the texting should be too."
dating,fm79oh2,t3_ft9po8,1585818476.0,"Isn’t this sort of like that cliche bad plot for an 80’s or 90’s romantic comedy? 

The nerdy, not so cultured yet, not the brightest or best dressed person has a huge crush on the high school football jock, the lead cheerleader, the super beautiful artsy girl he sees at a cafe everyday, the super hot guy in the office she just can’t stop thinking about.

Their dopey friend says you need a makeover. They change everything about themselves. ::Montage of the lead getting a haircut and color, shopping, working out, going to hobbies they KNOW their interest loves (funny and cute fall during yoga class) learning all these things like cooking, or a language because their crush adores Paris, etc etc etc.::

This “brand new” person walks into the room and their crush finally sees them. They start dating, but the lead is killing themselves trying to be something that doesn’t come naturally to them. 

Meanwhile their best friend of the opposite sex is pining after them, or a coworker the lead doesn’t notice, or some other person in the background of the leads life. Somehow the lead does meet this person but at first has no interest. But they build a wonderful bond or already have one. This person happens to appreciate the lead for being exactly who they are. They love how the lead dresses because either way they’re attracted to them, they like the leads shy off beat sometimes awkward behavior and humor, how they feel around them, how kind they are, how the lead doesn’t really see they’re special. 

Finally they call out the lead for turning into a different person and finally says something like “you know.... I loved you. I saw you. I have loved you before the crap in your hair, and your 200 dollar suit, before you knew some French, before you basically turned into HER. I don’t know you anymore. And maybe I don’t want to” ::they dramatically run off as the lead stands there in their too expensive outfit feeling empty and like a fraud.:: It either works out with their original “amazing love interest” buy they continue to feel uncomfortable because this isn’t really who they are. Or it doesn’t work out — again because deep down, none of that is really who they are. And ironically their crush dumps them because they’re too similar or it feels disingenuous or the jig is up so to speak and they don’t accept them anymore.

So the lead realizes that can never work. They’ll never find the love of their life by changing or “upgrading” everything for the sole purpose of doing it for someone else.

Then for my own happy amusement, the lead and the person who gave them enlightenment fall in love.
Both “misfits” who just want love. And realized they’re enough as themselves and enough for one another.

If you’re not healthy sure lose weight. If you’re PASSIONATE about anything yes go learn about it or learn how to do it. If you so enjoy clothes but haven’t put the effort into fashion have a ball, try some new styles or even get a haircut if you’ve wanted to change it for a long time— but don’t do all of this FOR the person you want or to BE the person you want and not for yourself. If you do it for yourself and it’s natural that’s great. But doing it for someone else won’t work. For the reason I mentioned above as cliche movie as it might be, it’s cliche for a reason. The moral is always to stay who you are and the right one will come and stay.

And changing yourself doesn’t guarantee more “likes” or interest at all. So then it’s really even more of a waste of time or bummer in the end. 

You shouldn’t have to change yourself INTO who you want. Never a problem for self improvement to happen but only for the right reasons.  Yes the person you’re with should inspire you to be better but not CHANGE you. A good partner wouldn’t want you to change unless it was for legit reasons, and reasons that are valid to you as well before you even met them. And don’t change into them, just brighten your OWN soul. Be your own unique self. That is always more attractive as well."

No idea who Mike would have chosen, but I definitely definitely don’t think Victoria F would have been final 4! In fact, most of the girls we were like “um why is she leaving night one or two? She’s actually tolerable!” would have stuck around a lot longer. Would have been a far less infuriating season to watch for many reasons. May have even ended in an actual engagement this time. Where he comes out normally with his fiancé who he proposed to.... normally. Because while Mike too can be immature, maybe isn’t ready to settle down yet and has moments that have annoyed me—- he’s far less fickle seeming then Peter, and he absolutely wouldn’t be into manipulative girls who cry every two seconds.

It’s odd you’re bringing this up after the fact of breaking up with him lol. I think you should have made him aware— yes he’d be embarrassed but he’s already embarrassed believe me. And it wasn’t like this was a one time thing and he didn’t have an actual health problem.

I dated someone with IBS and he tried to act like he wasn’t embarrassed about the entire thing in general— but I know deep down he was.

datingoverthirty,flw996n,t3_frbqsq,1585543198.0,"You just described my exact situation and exact worry.

Dating around 3 months. Exclusive not official. Gained momentum and were pretty close to probably a real talk about being official. Then this happened.

He’s not a big texter OR call guy. I’m not a big call girl, definitely not huge on FaceTime stuff I don’t mind Zoom. But oddly enough I enjoy texting more than phone and FaceTime. I don’t know why. He feels closer to me when we are in person, I can get closer by texting, calls, etc. I prefer being in person to all of that though obviously. We both have physical touch as our number one love language. My second is words of affirmation. His second is quality time. 

He did say the other day he feels more strongly for me everyday and not seeing me hasn’t changed his feelings. I hit a bump after an honest convo he wanted to have and was overthinking. We smoothed it out. But I’m still worried this effing pandemic will make something fizzle that had a ton of potential.

We agreed we’d see one another if on the 30th we both still don’t have symptoms. He’s past his 2 week waiting on symptoms after possible exposure before quarantine. My two weeks will be the 30th.

I’m moving and he’s moving. I’d be fine having him over to my new place if we both still have zero symptoms and we have both not been exposing ourselves to anyone new and have been careful in all the ways we should. I think it’s worth it to not let us fizzle. If we get symptoms that’s another story.

My ex wasn’t familiar with how it all worked. I explained, and he said ehhh we’ll see I doubt that’s what he wants. I said mark my words, he was eliminated 3rd and he’s thirsty AF for it, he will be bachelor. I called that even two weeks into her season when I knew peter at least made it to final 4. 

When he was announced bachelor I thought awe yay he got what he wanted. Can’t wait (not) for a season of a “I’m super nice tho” fu*boi acting like he wants a wife right now.

Honestly, it’s been so long since you mistreated her, whatever is wrong in her life has nothing to do with you. It’s nice you feel guilt I suppose and shows a part of your character that is good. Shows you have morals and a conscience. But just because you’re now reminded of this particular part of your life and feeling bad—- doesn’t mean it has to be addressed. Deal with the emotions and move on. Because I can bet you anything she isn’t sitting around pining for you or maybe even necessarily still blaming you for literally anything. If shes seemingly unhappy right now or was in an old relationship it is separate to you. And you’d be super selfish and quite arrogant to make this about you. Live your life and let her live hers.

It would be different if she reached out to you for closure. If so, yeah, good time to apologize and say you realize you treated her badly and wish you could change it. But this seems to all be coming from YOU. Not her. So it sounds harsh but.... suck it up? We all have made mistakes. No one is perfect in every relationship. You were also young but so was she. For all you know her unhappiness could be from the guy after you more so. Or a number of many other things."

We’ve been seeing each other for 3 months, so I do know him fairly well, but yes we took things a bit slow and there’s more to learn. He is a direct person and lays everything out there. I’m the same way and I’m definitely not a love bomber or user.

He hasn’t even come close to love bombing me. Tbh he’s a million times more mature than my latest two exes, one had narcissistic personality disorder so I know all about that and the other had his heart in the right place but wanted to rush everything and was too emotional. This guy for me moves a tad slow actually but I’m following HIS lead in actually not rushing for once. He just shares things that are important and I can relate. Him using me was legit never on my mind. And he’s not a bum. He’s not moving in with family because he doesn’t have a job. He has one really good job that is shut down, he will be paid still, but his other job is his own business but basically a creative freelance job that won’t be up and running for months. So he’s stressed. He was saving up for a house, but wants to help his mom and grandma and feels helpless. I totally understand his stress. However I don’t see why it would affect us if I don’t care about those things. (Him maybe not having as much time as he does now or enough money for awhile.

EnneagramType4,flhgp5l,t3_fooogr,1585162305.0,"Dude omg YEEEEEESSSSSSSSS

I’ll post things a lot I feel confident about and be fine.

But I feel shame, regret, humiliation and feelings of fear that I’ll be laughed at if I post 


Selfies (will people think I’m vain??) even though if you compared my selfie count to most other females mine is significantly lower. And I’m not amazing at it. I feel like people will immediately find me vain AF and yet selfies are the NORM and RAMPANT for females. I’ve deleted many. 

I finally decided to post some videos of myself singing and dancing during the quarantine. Felt confident whilst posting them, and then woke up in a panic thinking “omg why did you do that?” Thinking “people are gonna find this as cringey as I did” even though, I’m a good singer and dancer and while I can’t post videos like tiktok, I’m cringing because I’m self conscious. And I tried to see it from other people’s lenses but couldn’t stop thinking they’d see it as horrible or judge me or laugh. I deleted them immediately after I woke up with immense regret.

I do put certain posts on “public, friends, only me” and switch them a lot depending on how self conscious I’m feeling that day and what the subject matter is.

The crazy thing is and the thing that sucks is,

My whole life I’ve been this way. I know I’m a good looking person (though I of course suffer from being self conscious and focus on flaws and feel insecure a lot.)

But I’ve downplayed that for two reasons 1) I’m honestly not THAT vain and other things bring me more joy than feeling pretty but 2) my whole life as a 4 I felt like I was being “centered out” for being pretty and I couldn’t let anyone ever know I knew I was because then surely people will hate me right? But then I saw other girls posting tons of beautiful pics that I didn’t dare do for so long, getting so many compliments and I thought “why are they allowed to celebrate their beauty but I can’t sometimes?” I realized if I didn’t get as many likes i thought (incorrectly if I’m being logical) it was because people thought I was more vain than others girls doing the same But far more. Then a friend hit me with BRUTAL honesty but it helped. Hes a content creator, makeup artist and hes gay so very blunt with me! He said “you’re honestly probably not getting as many likes because you take not the best pics of yourself girl. You’re beautiful, trust, but you don’t exactly play the insta game the right way. People are prob
Confused or bored by your content. If you took amazing pics and played the game you’d have a shit ton of likes and followers. But don’t feel embarrassed by it, it’s actually cute and refreshing when people DONT play the game right but could. Don’t blame your looks or even wanting posting shit for the reason behind less likes. Either step up your game and learn how to take the sort of pics people respond to, or do your own thing and who cares?” 
It hit me hard. He gives good truth bombs.  🤯 

So it kind of sucks because lots of poetry, great pics, videos of certain talents of mine— I’ve hid it all from the world most of the time thinking it wasn’t good enough or I’d seem full of myself or vain or the content isn’t good enough (maybe the selfies aren’t lol) but the rest is honestly fine and I’ve cheated myself of confidence and celebration of confidence by posting it with no fucks given! For years. And I’m over it. Being a 4 is so hard. We are so in our heads and so self conscious about our every move. It’s insane. After I deleted my videos recently I regretted that too because why? Other people do it and they post far worse content than even me lol. 

We should try work through the discomfort. (If you want to post freely) we deserve to celebrate our talents or looks too 🤷🏻‍♀️"

So the more they ignored my requests or even denied talking about it anymore I felt pushed away, silenced and invalidated until I had to end it. But you can better effing believe that every time, either when I said I was “done” they immediately said all the things I wanted to hear and said they’d change “A, B, and C” and fought so hard in those moments so I wouldn’t break up with them (sometimes it worked and I’d give them some more time but they didn’t change so I’d leave for good) or they’d let me go without toooo much of a fight, maybe still the classic things I wanna hear yadda yadda but let me go and then a week later or two weeks they are begging on the phone saying they’ll do ANYTHING to make it work. 

Why couldn’t they do “ANYTHING” to make it work when we were still together, I was still madly in love, and I truly politely tried to calmly talk about my wants and needs that were becoming huge issues for me? It’s always when they are gonna lose me or lost me that they’ll change. If they have me, they really don’t think it’s a big deal I guess. Screw that.

4w5,fkvehju,t3_fkozmm,1584567581.0,This is why no one understands me and why I don’t understand myself anymore lol
thebachelor,fktbihz,t1_fkso0r3,1584512766.0,What is Hannah going through?
thebachelor,fktb7ww,t1_fksm5on,1584512438.0,He’s not “genuinely happy” trust me it’s way too soon after she passed. But hes having a good moment which is healthy and good.
thebachelor,fktb0q4,t3_fki4m6,1584512215.0,"I never left Denial den TBH so this feels good. But also, I’m totally fine if they don’t become a couple soon or for a long time considering he’s going to be grieving for a long time :( and relationships shouldn’t start off from that. But a good friendship can and should :) but deep down I hope they turn into more when he’s ready 😻"
thebachelor,fktaw3a,t3_fk4x9r,1584512075.0,"I don’t like Dean.

I don’t like Cassie and Colton separately or together.

I don’t like Ben Higgins.

I couldn’t stand John Paul Jones and that season of BIP was the worst ever. 

I don’t follow any of them.

I don’t follow JoJo and Jordan but I’m pretty neutral to them from what I hear about.

I seem to not really like a lot of favorites anymore. And I’m fine with it."

thebachelor,fkmsmce,t3_fja8nj,1584338512.0,"They wouldn’t ever be compatible on a real level. He’s hilarious and full of personality. She’s sweet, but she isn’t exactly full of personality like Hannah B for instance. Tyler prob wants a girl who is gorgeous yes but also with a dynamic and interesting personality. Hannah Ann is just sort of..... meh? She’s a little boring. I give her props for standing up for herself on AFTR and during the breakup. And she seems very sweet. Obviously she’s gorgeous. But a bundle of dynamic personality she is not. Tyler isn’t the deepest of dudes— but I just have a feeling she’d bore him to death."
dating,fkmsfby,t3_fj8vp8,1584338311.0,How do you know she wasn’t nursing a bruised ego and lied about having some dude over?
datingoverthirty,fkl9wmu,t1_fkl4xw3,1584301689.0,"He went through it but not for too long— it didn’t affect our relationship in the long term whatsoever. I am very aware about things I know that are deep rooted that affected me. That happens to not be one of them. It’s why I’m not an alcoholic myself and have never dated anyone with alcoholism before actually.  Before this one guy. And not only because my dad went through it. Because I’ve seen friends, and others go through that and other addictions. I never had or have “daddy issues”—- our relationship remained intact. I’m thankful for that. I may not be aware yet why I’m insecure in relationships with men but I know for a flying ass fact it’s nothing to do with my dad. I felt loved by him from when I was a baby to the day he unfortunately passed. Harder times because of that issue? Totally. High drama? Actually no. He wasn’t an angry dude. It wasn’t really the cliche you might think of. Did it leave scars like other things in life did? Thankfully not, because we were very close."
datingoverthirty,fkl365h,t3_fj1t93,1584297482.0,"There are zero benefits. I tried it, more like 3 then 2 and my life became an utter shit show. I’m not capable of it in any capacity. I learned my lesson, you only end up somehow hurting others and yourself even if you’re honest. I’m back to one at a time, steady as she goes, but not gonna throw myself into a full blown relationship thing too quickly as I normally do.

It starts out like yeah hey, I’m gonna actually try date for once! Not throw all my eggs in one basket with the first connection I have. But then you May actually hit it off with a few. Then you might actually get feels for more than one. And that sucks. It is too much. You see two very different futures with very diff people but you can’t effing decide because yeah you’re either giving more time to one than the other or dividing and not getting enough time to really truly know. And end up being a selfish asshole like I was. It’s ridiculous and I will NEVER do it again. Ever. And yeah I don’t know how others do it either."
datingoverthirty,fkl2pjh,t1_fkl05yc,1584297199.0,Woah there pistol-know it all magee over here. No. Absolutely no. My (late) father was the most loving and incredible dad in the world. The opposite of the type of men I’ve dated my entire life. Jesus. Slow your roll there before you say something that heavy. Nope. Aaaaand nope.
datingoverthirty,fkkn8mf,t1_fkjybro,1584287815.0,Thank you!
