They already know that how they treat you is wrong, they just don't care. How they are treating you is flat out financial and emotional abuse. 

The biggest favor you can do yourself is go back home, cut contact, and if they bother you any further, get a restraining order if necessary. Be fully prepared to call the police if you have to. Many abusers will try to do whatever they can to keep someone in their life so they can keep using them."

Be warned though, it can be very hard for kittens who aren't weaned yet to survive without their mother. Even if you do EVERYTHING right, they might not survive, so be prepared for that. Sometimes mother cats abandon their kittens because they are sick and won't survive at all. I wish you luck."

entitledparents,f8e6sks,t1_f8e6ott,1574520261.0,Now who's the one being childish and insulting? I'm sorry but you're honestly just not even worth my time. Blocked.
entitledparents,f8e6r9b,t1_f8e6jhh,1574520229.0,You did so in a rude and insulting way and no I am not. Everything does not have to be abuse. But having been through it myself I can see when something is sometimes when other people can't.
entitledparents,f8e6go7,t1_f8e6eb9,1574519968.0,"You were insulting to me first, so I merely returned the favor."
entitledparents,f8e5him,t1_f8e4wwb,1574519098.0,"It can also prove she didn't want her husband to find out what she did. You don't think abusive parents don't go to great lengths to hide it or even manipulate the child into believing they're being treated right? Lets just be adults about this and agree to disagree. Besides, without more info, there's really no telling. Maybe the Mom's a bad person, and maybe she isn't, but it's a bad situation and I feel bad for OP. Many people consider pets to be family."
entitledparents,f8e2xph,t1_f8e2jcp,1574517257.0,"I never want abuse to happen, and yes deliberately hurting a child emotionally for no good reason is abuse. End of story. Maybe it's what happened in this case, maybe it isn't. But as someone who personally experienced many different forms of abuse I will stand against it. Call me overdramatic if you want, I don't really care. Hurting someone isn't okay and saying oh well I'm right because it was technically legal is just... ugh. Technically you can take away a child's teddy bear and rip it apart in front of them too because um, you bought the bear and you're the one who gave it to them, so technically it's your property, but it's still a horrible thing to do! I don't see what's so hard about that to understand. -.-"
entitledparents,f8e2ebx,t1_f8e1rra,1574516836.0,"*Rolls eyes.* You don't lie to your child and spouse. It's not hard. OP also said their mother has lied about many other things as well. So okay, sometimes parents tell lies to their kids to prevent having to tell them a harsh truth. Fine. I get that. Why lie to her husband too? Why did the husband seem to have no idea about the situation? I mean yes fine, granted, we need more info, but what I'm hearing so far isn't good and it raises red flags. Abuse of the highest order? No, but it's still a lousy thing to do."
entitledparents,f8e1psd,t1_f8e1ku7,1574516320.0,I haven't lost anything. Like I said I know what I'm talking about from personal experience while you obviously have no idea whatsoever what you're talking about.
entitledparents,f8e1i4m,t1_f8e170m,1574516164.0,"Child abuse is FAR more common than most people think, and again, the father was also unaware of what she did, which raises major red flags. Just because someone is 15 doesn't mean they don't know when they're being treated badly. Heck, a 5 year old can know when they're being treated badly."
entitledparents,f8e11y5,t1_f8e0rby,1574515787.0,"You're not abusive for having a different opinion. What's abusive is you think it's okay to emotionally hurt children for no good reason. That's not okay. It's never been okay. It never WILL be okay. This spoken from a person who has been through actual abuse, so I know exactly what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to continue to waste my time and beat a dead horse."
entitledparents,f8e0omm,t1_f8e0j08,1574515484.0,No what the world doesn't need is abusive assholes like you. Have a good day and enjoy your future terrible nursing home because you were a jerk to your kids and they hate you now. :D
entitledparents,f8e0hcf,t1_f8dzjij,1574515315.0,"You're one of those, I have no empathy for others so anything I do that is technically legal is okay. Please never have children."
entitledparents,f8e08wg,t1_f8d12tr,1574515131.0,"I didn't say for OP to just move out and get away from their parents right away. I SAID to look into what resources are available, consider the situation, and get help. I said distance MIGHT be what needs to be done IF things are bad and don't change.

Whether you are right or wrong about this situation, you Sir, are quite frankly being arrogant, condescending, insulting, and have alarmingly little empathy.  People like you are exactly the reason why many abuse victims are afraid to come forward. Because they fear they won't be listened to, believed, or that people simply won't care.

Above all, OP needs to be in a safe situation. That's what matters. If they're safe with their parents, great. If not, then yes, they DO need to get out.

If everything they said about their situation is correct, then that immediately raises red flags and sounds alarm bells.

Maybe further educate yourself on this subject, don't comment on it, or just content yourself on being part of the problem instead of the solution.

I won't be bothering to respond further."
entitledparents,f8dzc4n,t1_f8csq1a,1574514373.0,"Yes, they can, as their mother lied to both them AND their father and sold the dog. If the father was the co-owner of the dog, that's called theft. You don't do this kind of crap to kids. It's called emotional abuse."
entitledparents,f8c70az,t3_dx3aib,1574453914.0,"Was browsing and found this. Hon, I have bipolar disorder myself. Trust me that isn't an excuse to be an abusive jerk to your child. Especially if he's refusing to get help or medication for it. There are some people who even use having something like that as an EXCUSE to be a jerk. Well I can't help it because I have blah blah blah. Uh uh, no. Please don't let yourself fall into that trap!"
entitledparents,f8byda6,t1_f8btmw6,1574448176.0,"Wrong. Their parents are trying to make them come on a vacation for an entire month without any means to study which would make them fail their college courses. Not only that but their parents also want them to pay to come. OP also said in the comments their parents are threatening to kick them out of the house if they don't comply. It's completely unreasonable, controlling, and a classic emotionally abusive move. Just because a child is now a legal adult, doesn't mean that the abuse just stops. Like I said, I speak from EXPERIENCE."
entitledparents,f8b9xo0,t1_f8b9dy4,1574431519.0,"Child abuse is far more likely than most people realize, and damn right I get angry when I see ignorant statements like yours. Accusing someone who was abused of being a liar and telling them to suppress their emotions can be dangerously harmful and I sincerely hope you don't do this to people in real life."
entitledparents,f8b8ukt,t1_f84aqao,1574430631.0,"You're either incorrect or lying to get sympathy? Extremely unlikely event? Put your emotions away and be an adult? Now THAT is some bad advice! Not to mention nasty accusations against someone who could very well be telling the truth. 

Child abuse of children who have become legal adults definitely exists. Abusive parents making unreasonable demands definitely exists. Suppressing your emotions to deal with any kind of abuse just makes the problem worse, not better. Your so called advice is just as bad if not worse, and I know this from my own personal experience. 

OP I hope you get help to get out of this situation and if your parents are pulling this I'm betting that past behavior from them has been no better nor will it become any better in the future. I strongly suggest you look into what resources you can use to help you, including potentially getting any therapy you might need. Don't make any big decisions while you're upset. Think things through carefully. Realistic boundaries with your parents are a must and if they can't respect them it may be time to get distance from them. I wish you the best."
entitledparents,f8b40tj,t1_f8b3i7k,1574426129.0,"Sorry, I don't own a car, house, or dog. Would you like my crazy cat? Careful, he bites! Anyway, you are completely missing the point. The point being, parents, don't be a jerk to your child, for one day they may be choosing whether or not to cut you out of their life or put you in a really bad nursing home. Someday, children grow up, and you better believe they remember."
