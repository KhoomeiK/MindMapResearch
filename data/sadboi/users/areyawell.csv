BPD,fc61p0u,t3_egc0mm,1577470272.0,"Personality disorders are tough ones to explain because ""personality"" is such a nebulous and individual concept. Everyone knows generally what a personality is, but when you ask someone to break what a personality is down into components, you'll probably find a lot of very different opinions on what makes one up.

For psychiatric purposes, we can think of personality as someone's fundamental patterns of thought, behaviour and emotion that they have developed throughout their childhood and developmental periods. The biopsychosocial model used by most psychiatrists today acknowledge one common accepted theory: feelings influence thoughts, thoughts influence behaviour, and behaviour in turn influences feelings. 

Trauma changes the physical structure of your brain, which in turn changes how you think. Through a combination of genetic (someone in your family having bpd, it's very heritable) and environmental (trauma, etc) factors, people with bpd develop abnormal patterns of thoughts, behaviours and feelings that impact your functioning significantly enough that it requires diagnosis and treatment. No matter how personality disorders manifest, they all share these characteristics. 

So you can describe bpd as an illness that disrupts and/or distorts the way you process your own thoughts, behaviour and emotions about yourself as a person as well as people you know.

SkincareAddiction,fc10696,t3_efiryo,1577304494.0,"I really didn't give a shit about myself for the first 23 or so years of my life and it's only after maintaining a skincare routine for a few months that I've realised how badly I didn't give a shit about myself. I have bpd and every day it's a battle to tolerate myself and my own thoughts. Even showering is a fucking chore. I was an alcoholic for a decade - my skin was horrific and scarred and dehydrated but I couldn't even tell you what my skin type was. I cared so little about myself I wasn't even conscious of how my skin looked. Just didn't occur to me. 

I hate admitting it, but the best way to get to loving and caring about yourself is just forcing yourself to fucking do it. Every time you do your routine, or take time with your makeup, or put thought into what you're eating - incredibly basic shit I scoffed at psychiatrists for suggesting - you're treating yourself the way you *should* be treated. And the more you practise self care, the more you realise you deserve it.

Then suddenly it's 6 months down the line and I find myself doing all sorts of shit I never would have done before like stand up for myself or flirting with little to no anxiety, or even really just going outside *at all*. It started small with skincare, then I started getting back into makeup and bought myself new clothes that actually fit - small acts of self love that gradually evolve into bigger and more substantial ones.
