Dark jokes in the context of a friends group that understands you don't mean it, or actually hate the people you're talking about? Totally fine. Dark jokes with colleagues as a method of coping? Totally fine. Dark jokes with customers?  NOT fine.  Dark jokes on a stage or broadcast to people who don't understand that you don't mean it or take the message to heart and secretly think that actually, yeah, it's genuinely funny that the Holocaust happened, or that it didn't happen and are laughing for that reason? Not fine, personally. 

I also still think that if your only method of being funny is dark humour, then it says something about you. (A general 'you', not you personally) a well-balanced sense of humour should include jokes that don't require making fun of someone else to be funny. If someone needs to make fun of other people *all the time* to be funny, then it says a lot about them. I vent using dark jokes, but im also constantly self-deprecating and funny about things that have nothing to do with people at all. Humour doesn't have to always have the potential of harming someone.

Punching up means making fun of people who have more or equal power than/to you. So making jokes about your own culture or billionaires or the government. It's a bit of a phrase that I find weird to define, but that makes more sense in theory. Like picking on your own size."

It's a very well known phenomenon that abuse victims gravitate towards abusers because it's a familiar situation and the only way they know how to be treated. Abuse is a fucking hard cycle to break because it's tied into self worth and it takes years of therapy and changing your entire perception of yourself and other people.

I had a really protective dad like this growing up. He'd tell me if I ever brought a guy home, he had a ""shovel and a backyard"" or an axe handle and a backyard. I'd tell him to quit it but he was undeterred and I never have brought a guy home. Quelle surprise. I've actually slowly cut my parents out of my life for more reasons than this, but behaviour similar. My dad also makes jokes i find deeply uncomfortably, like rape jokes or jokes at gay people (I'm LGBTQ but have never come out to them) despite the fact I've told him I'm uncomfortable. He talks about hookers a lot, jokingly. He doesn't do it. I think a lot of men who are this protective are projecting how they think about women and trying to defend them from *men like them*.

A similar but positive anectode on male protectiveness. I was stalked recently across a country by my ex who found out where I work and sent flowers to me anonymously. It was not welcome and creeped me the fuck out and sent me into an agoraphobic anxiety spiral for a couple of weeks where I was terrified he'd show up at my door or my city. One of my best friends here is a big guy and said if he did turn up, he'd defend me (not in a cringy way, I can't remember the phrasing but that's the spirit of it) and I really appreciated it. I'm very smol and my ex is very large and I was scared as hell. Another male friend walked me home with his arm around me when I had a panic attack because I was out in public during this. 

I think I wanted to make a point that protectiveness isn't a bad thing? It's just when it's not wanted or when it's trying to take choice away from someone that it's weird and not okay. I'm rambling and ill thank you and goodnight."

For example, I recently read a Twitter thread of a man attempting to explain to a female gynaecologist that her knowledge of female anatomy was incorrect and that the vulva is actually called the vagina.
