Given the information you provided as you stated ""She was my first girlfriend"".. It will most definitely take time to get over. The first is ALWAYS difficult. You just need to concentrate on the positives. You gained some experience from this relationship and that can help you as you move forward in life. Most people do not end up with their first lover for the rest of their lives. It takes time to find someone that values the same things as you do as well as someone who is willing to provide unconditional love and care for you. If love is conditional than that means there are stipulations to the relationship or that it is for a beneficial purpose, while unconditional love much different. Unconditional love is never ending, and there are no stipulations to it. You choose to love that person NO MATTER WHAT--For better or for worse. I am currently 19F and it took me a significant amount of relationships to find someone I can settle down with.**"
depression,fnti113,t3_g3ljni,1587242061.0,"Trust me I get it. I am 19F and my father moved out of the country. We hardly communicate now. We have spoken once on the phone in the last four months which is nothing compared to how it was prior to the move. I used to chat with my father on a daily basis and I lived with him. All of that changed when he left and moved out of the country. I slipped into a depression that no one understood. I was mad and upset that my own father wouldn't try and call or message me, but when I expressed such moods to him he told me the ""The phone works both ways."" He said I should put in the effort as well and try to communicate with him and that is not a one way road. At this point I have accepted his decision that he moved away and I need to grow up, but it was a long and hurtful process."
relationship_advice,fnbh9kt,t3_g0nubf,1586815507.0,Love is a choice. You choose who you love. Look at the positives and make sure they out weigh the negatives. As long as you focus on the good it will ALWAYS outweigh the negative. Learn to understand one another. Fights shouldn’t be addressed toward each other. It should be the couple against the problem not let’s fight each other because “I’m right” and “You’re wrong”. Fights should never be about who is right and who is wrong because at the end of the day you guys are a TEAM! WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE ISSUES.
