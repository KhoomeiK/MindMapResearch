I know there's more to it, but right now try to remember they there IS loveliness, life in you; there is beauty in lability and fragility. There's something terrifying and so just very human about how humans are horrified to scare each other off, and we, initially, react much, much deeper to that. Try to remind yourself there's also goodness when all your brain is giving you is just constant shit. Fucking chemical reaction bastards.
Give yourself some breathing room. Try to watch your reactions: you know you'll go through a ton of feelings, they will switch. You said she's a lovely girl, so hold your horses and don't sabotage it for her sake: try to behave emotionally eco-friendly.
And good god, have a wonderful time."
