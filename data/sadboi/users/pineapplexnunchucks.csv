I haven’t tried a rice cleanse yet but I have seen Courtney’s beer cleanse, which seems quite interesting!! 

Smasters is some method where you apply more product when your hair is 50% dry. I haven’t quite gotten the hang of it though. I actually heard it a few times through Courtney’s videos and on her IG!!

I’m more frustrated because I purchased products a little while back that I thought were okay/good for my hair only to find out more information on a confusing-to-me subject. I hate wasting product so I tried to work in a shampoo with my routine and it was horrid. 🙄"

Now, I ind her a tad bit cringe BUT I wrote down step by step her wash day, noticed she did another wash day on day 3 (so I didn’t feel bad about washing so close together) and used knowledge from Mel. I. Was. Impressed. Literally so blown away. I needed protein, not moisture!!!! 😅 

My wash day on Sunday with a protein mask was absolute shiiiiiiiit, even though I followed a lot of the steps I’ve seen over many months of research (even though it comes off as if I haven’t ever taken the time to watch videos or anything to some people. I literally spend hours in front of the computer researching DAILY). 

Anyhoo, I used OGX Moroccan shampoo (light blue bottle) and Hask curl conditioner, added some random Shea Logic 12-in-1 leave in Ive had for a while, this mixed texture curl custard I found at a little shop down the road (idk the name of it), Curls Gellee and LA Looks 10 hold gel (maybe a tsp of all but LA). Scrunched my heart out, dry plopped, diffused, added more LA (Smasters method), diffused to 90% and air dry for about 25 minutes, SOTC and OMGGGGGG IT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!!

Thank you so much for explaining and clarifying the process for me. I’m worried of using the Suave too much as I don’t want my hair to lighten or fade since I moved and my hairdresser is way back in Florida and I have no way of re-dying my hair. 😭😭😭"

I do the micro plopping and regular plopping depending on the day and products use. I honestly think I just try too many things within a short amount of time (roughly two weeks) and think I need to learn more patience. 

I’ve saved A LOT of info from swavy Courtney but also watch Manes by Mel and her sister Amanda to follow the techniques and such. I suppose it depends on the products and way I style (using a Denman brush vs raking and coiling). I did just pic up new products for basic wash day, like Suave shampoo and conditioner for an actual cleanse and I’m hoping this will help restart my journey properly.

The fact is, you’re marrying your girlfriend, not your mother or some other family member.

askwomenadvice,f7lbrzg,t1_f7kmbvz,1573837065.0,"Agreed!! Sciences and labs usually go hand in hand, so you can drop the lab and keep the class but not vice versa. If this is the case, and you still have time, withdraw from the lab immediately and do not go through to the end with an F and risk that on your GPA. It will diminish instantly and be a terrible climb back up. Try to get another professor the following semester if possible, or speak with your advisor/dean to get assistance. 

I know this is basic but BREATHE. Make a list of things you need to have done by the end of the week (make a list on Monday for everything due by Sunday, each assignment in each class). It sounds tedious, and it really is, but it helps create some sort of organization in the chaos called Life. 

Anytime you feel overwhelmed at home, take a break and do something else. Watch an episode of a show, draw for half an hour, do squats, scroll Reddit, whatever but give yourself a much needed break and time it. 

I’ve been a bartender for 11 years, the last three at a restaurant with smaller uniforms where men think it’s perfectly fine to take pictures and record you behind the bar.

Maybe, just maybe he didn’t feel comfortable losing his virginity at 28 with a person who would make him feel worthless, if he doesn’t feel so already. Yeah, he needs to learn some tact but the way these responders are shaming you for your casual sex is the same way you’re shaming him for asking a close friend for help. Granted, it’s not the most normal way but guys have shaming issues, too. It’s not babying them. Sometimes people just plain and simple don’t have boundaries. You stated he’s a very polite and anxious person, which more than likely prevents him from being with a lady even more. 

I have BP1 and gone through the casual sex phase as well, and I’ve taken this whole point into consideration with past experiences. Not all men are trash, not all men are comfortable in their own skin, or are “macho men.” Many are insecure and just as afraid of being ditched after losing their virginity as women are.
