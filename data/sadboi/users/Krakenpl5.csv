One time, I forgot to log out of my account on the pc there. Then the third friend, visited the same house and used the same pc. When I came back to my account he had deleted all my friends, and written mean things about me on my bio. In school, when I asked the first friend about this he said that I should ask the other friend that was visiting. The ""visiting"" friend shall i call him, blamed all the fault on the first friend.

Later on it turned out it actually was the visiting friend. I only found out a week after it all started. 
Before I found out, he was telling me all kinds of bad and mean things about the ""innocent"" friend. 

A month or more after this the friend that lied, and did all that stuff moved to another school."
