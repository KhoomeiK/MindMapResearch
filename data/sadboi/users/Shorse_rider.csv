AskMarketing,fr2wcu9,t3_glz23w,1589845178.0,"The tools for social channel monitoring only aggregate the data that you can get for free within each  of your accounts analytics. Many brands turn to tools  so they can publish  content across channels from one place and report from one place without having to export data into excel from Facebook Analytics etc.

So you need to weigh up whether you do it manually and cheaper or use a tool. A mid weight social media analyst can operate without the tool and can sometimes be a cheaper option than the commitment of a tool.

The best tool I have used is called Sprinklr. This has different components and different types of licence packages to suit your needs.

Edit below:

Metrics: You can look to streamline metrics across channels (e.g. engagement metrics). Reach is another factor. Sometimes content performs well purely because it has had a wider reach.

Something that is growing in popularity is Social Listening. This utilises tools (often a tool that helps you to monitor content will have the social listening functionality too) to grab all the passive mentions of a brand or in your case hospital, and you can do interesting things like look at the mentions over time, see if there are any trending themes that come up in  relation to the hospital, look at sentiment  trends and scores (i.e. are people saying you deliver exceptional care or complaining about it..). Social Listening insights ladder up to key business objectives and you can really make actionable recommendations off the  back of the insights you discover in a way that is much trickier with social media post reporting."

The experience with the HIV guy is maddening. I  cannot believe he did not tell you sooner. That's insane. We need laws to protect people, so we can decide whether or not to take the risk, rather than have someone make that choice for us. It really reveals how self-serving people are and how this can be to the detriment of others. 

I'm glad you have self awareness. All of life is about experiences and learning from them. So many people get caught up in looking inwards when things don't work. And constantly think 'how can I be better?'. But the reality is, it isn't always on you. It isn't down to losing another 10lbs or gaining x muscle. It's not about how carefully you craft your words, and being the absolute best person you can be for THEM. 

Peoples words can be empty, they can say  what they have to say to get their prize, but not mean a word of it.

These two are by Chidera Eggerue. She's a really inspiring feminist writer from London UK. 
1. What a time to be alone
2. How to get over a boy

Ester Perel wrote a book called Mating in Captivity. It's an awesome book about lust and intimacy within  relationships and keeping the fire alive. She is a therapist and has had a lot of celebrity clientele included Will and Jada.

AskWomenOver30,fq414p8,t1_fq3x85c,1589072548.0,"My family commented that they could see my character and my essence get pulled under by it. Everything I did, it was like he came first. His preferences, comfort etc. I have always been very anti-conflict but I took my agreeableness to the next level. And I couldn't speak up if I needed something. 

Looking back I am actually more traumatised by how I self-sabotaged/sacrificed in  that relationship, rather than anything else. I'll definitely consider my dignity in  future."
