Mention right away that this is difficult for you because you have trouble opening up and that your anxiety has been playing tricks on you and making you worry about how it will go and what they might think of you. This is a good way to break the ice with complete honesty. They will be much more equipped to help you by guiding you through the session with your comfort in mind. I just had my first appointment Monday and, honestly, it was all housekeeping. I told her a 1 hour version of my current life and a brief history of important experiences. She wrote down names and asked a few questions. She summarized everything at the end and left it up to me to complete ""homework"" by asking myself if my current life circumstances are serving me positively and what I can control or change to help myself. We'll discuss that next time. Good luck!!!!!"

Level 1 has parents there, the songs are recordings (so no singing like L2) and you get PM hours as well as AM because they aren't in school. Easy money for being silly for 25 minutes!"

I'll keep it blonde for a while to experiment. I'll add that students comment on my eye color often. 

Also, I'm convinced that teachers with colored hair (blue, purple, green, etc.) get lots of bookings!"

I just saw a post on a FB group this morning talking about how she should word her feedback because the student WIPED STICKY BOOGERS ALL OVER THE CAMERA.  She couldn't see the student at all.  Y'ALL. I would absolutely be so disgusted. I can't handle that shit. BUT THEN the amount of teachers I saw saying ""who cares? Kids will be kids!*~üòú"" or ""I love a challenge!"" Or ""yeah that's normal behavior from children. Duh."" Or ""Send him to me! I love a challenge!"" WHAT... and I can't stress this enough... THE FUCK. 

Those types of teachers don't leave accurate T2T because they are too drunk on koolaid to admit to themselves, let alone other teachers, that they've had a difficult class/student."
