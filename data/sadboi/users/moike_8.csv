SuicideWatch,fr2gzq3,t1_fqv5ze1,1589837118.0,"Okay, so you feel like that that line of thinking is such that you felt like your purpose was to serve other people, because you were responsible for them, is that what you mean? How do you feel about that thinking now?

And in what way do you feel that expressing yourself will hurt someone as well?

So do you feel that if someone else fails, the same applies to them ever?

I see, and so in that hypothetical situation, what do you feel you would use that physical violence or being more cruel to do?

That must be difficult to deal with, you said that you hate your body, and you talked a bit more about your ideal body, but just to check, what makes you feel that way? How does it feel to see your body as well, if you feel comfortable talking about it? And have you ever thought about talking to anyone, anonymously or otherwise about how you are feeling?

Yes, of course. Honestly, I try to talk here because I see the posts and I just thought at some point that if talking to people could help, even a little, even just sometimes. Then it's worth it, and I can do that, and hope it helps someone, even a bit. I don't tend to post really because I don't use reddit for much else at the moment, but I guess I could if I did use it more often. Does that answer your question? And do you want to ask anything else?"
SuicideWatch,fr2ftau,t1_fqwt5x7,1589836539.0,"I see, so if you don't know if people can be given second chances, what makes you feel so sure that you can't be given one in that sense?

So just to check I'm following, you feel that normal would be doing certain things at specific times?

Ah okay, and so in that way, do you feel like if someone else's life has always been a certain way, do you feel that there could be any possible thing that could change so that their life wasn't like that in the future?"
SuicideWatch,fqv1lvj,t1_fqt2wqh,1589668056.0,"So in general, do you feel people are capable of giving, or being given second chances ever? Do you feel that ever happens?

Okay, so what do you see as normal in that sense?

And so just to check, you feel like it will always be like this because it always was like this in the past?"
SuicideWatch,fqv1atf,t1_fqrjs3h,1589667881.0,"I see, and so you mentioned how that message views being angry, but how do you feel about it sometimes? You also talked about apathy if you're not good at things immediately, how do you feel about that?

And with regard to the social pressure to act within social norms, if a situation like that ever happened again, just hypothetically, and you would rather write in some situations, how would you ideally want to communicate that so you didn't feel that way again, or feel that way less?

Okay, and how does that thought of being a boy not a girl make you feel, if you don't mind me asking?"
SuicideWatch,fqr1582,t1_fqi4wba,1589575661.0,"No of course you don't have to explain every detail, I'm sorry if it sounded like that, I was just trying to understand how you would have wanted them (the online people) to support you was all. It must have been difficult to have gone through that, you said that you feel alone in the world, and that when people learn of your story they vanish, do you feel like that always will always happen? And what makes you feel that way if you do?

I'm not trying to convince you of anything, but from my perspective, it seems like you could make progress, and maybe I'm not fully sure how best to go about that, and I'm aware that I don't know every detail and that it's not as easy as just saying that, that is all I meant. Hope that explains it a bit better. Given what you've said you see as progress, you mentioned working, what would you like to do for work?

What makes you feel like no one wants to deal with you because you are too old as well?"
SuicideWatch,fqgzuh9,t1_fqbjmvr,1589362936.0,"About the first part, I meant how you mentioned that the people you talked to online stopped, that it went worse, and that you felt abandoned, in what way did you feel abandoned?

Honestly, yes, maybe. I can see how it would be difficult, given your situation atm, and what you’ve gone through, and I’m not trying to say its easy. But it depends what you see as progress, so what would you see as progress, even a little?"

What makes you feel like you have reached your maximum potential as well then?"
SuicideWatch,fpwqxs1,t1_fpr8y33,1588968343.0,"Okay, and again if you're okay talking about it, how did you feel things went from there?

That must be difficult to have gone through and to deal with, so do you feel you still experience that same level of self isolation, just to check?

We also talked a while back about having independence, and how you'd like to move away, how do you feel about that at the moment, just hypothetically?"
SuicideWatch,fpe6zul,t1_fpa9qep,1588541609.0,"I see, that must have been difficult, and so did you react when she said that, if you feel comfortable talking about it?

And how do you feel hikikomori (I'm unfamiliar if I'm using that correctly, apologies) affects you at the moment?"
SuicideWatch,fpe6rj9,t1_fpb2dgf,1588541480.0,"Okay, and what makes you feel like she might have said that it was unacceptable to feel that way?

And you said that you can't bring yourself to use your voice, have you ever thought about any other methods of communicating in that kind of environment if you were to ever feel that way again, like if you were hypothetically talking to someone about how you were feeling and they said that?

I see, and do you feel like there might be any other reason why someone might try to open you up in that sense? What makes you feel like crying means that you are weak as well?

Hm, and how do you feel people are at things in general when they just start or haven't done them in a while? And what makes you feel like that will happen if you do show up then?"
SuicideWatch,fp78uxh,t1_fp3yre2,1588366149.0,"I see, and so you feel like you might have had that panic attack because you were ashamed that you felt like you couldn't talk to her? If a situation ever happened like that again, would you feel comfortable discussing/expressing that you were feeling that way in any other way? Or have you ever thought about something like that?

And what does control in that sense mean to you?

That does sound really nice, I looked up a few images just now and can agree that it looks like quite a green place to live, though I've never been there. So would you want to live somewhere like Savannah or just somewhere in Georgia maybe?

Oh awesome, what do you usually paint?

Okay, and so what makes you feel like that might happen? Or what makes you feel like people might react that way, if you feel comfortable talking about it?"
SuicideWatch,fp3f67n,t1_foyo4ca,1588278239.0,"So you feel like when she said that if felt like she was trying to tell you how she thought you should feel, rather than how you actually felt, if that makes sense? And so if someone did respond like that hypothetically, how would you feel about talking to them about it?

You also mentioned that the anger made you feel ashamed, how so?

Florida seems like a nice place from what I've seen, what is Georgia like? How do things feel when you are camping with friends then as well?

Ah lol, that's cool, and so what art do you usually do as well?

Okay, so in what way do you feel like it won't be as good? And what makes you feel like something might go wrong as well?"
SuicideWatch,fp3dnq2,t1_foynx2a,1588277489.0,"I see, and so do you mind me asking what she told you were lying about or exaggerating in that sense?

SuicideWatch,foyk45d,t1_foya4lr,1588173963.0,"Hm, I see, and  do you feel the therapist could have meant anything else when she said that, or not so much? How would you have wanted the therapist to respond when you told her something as well?

I'm glad to hear that you're feeling chilled out, you mentioned that you don't have the motivation to go out, where would you ideally want to go if you had more motivation then?

Oh sims is cool, never got into it myself but watched some people play it, when did you get into that?

I see, that sounds difficult, so just to clarify, you feel like, since karate, you feel like you haven't had that outlet for your feelings of aggression? And that you can't express them around people without feeling like you'll be seen as an angry person?

 How did it feel when you were able to do karate in that way as well?"

Have you ever felt less bad when going out in that way as well, or is there anything you'd ideally like to change in relation to that?

What video games have you been playing recently as well?

You also said that you can't express yourself that you feel like you are wanting to be everything that you are, what do you mean by that, just to check?"

I see, and so you mentioned control there, what does control in that sense mean to you? And if you feel comfortable talking about it, how has it felt in the past if you have lost or not had that control?

And you mentioned that you're struggling with your college classes because of how you're feeling, have you ever thought about talking to anyone about that at all?

You said that expressing that is wrong, what makes you feel that way? And what do you feel you are expressing when you do that as well?

Ah, that must have been hard, it worries me to hear that you're feeling like that, you said that everyone you've known has had those expectations of you, so how would it feel if you were away from that, hypothetically? How would you, or what would you see as expressing yourself then?

I see, and so how do you feel about your friends from college in relation to that?"

You have also mentioned this a bit, but just to check, what makes you feel like expressing your emotions would upset the other person as well?

That must have been difficult for you to have gone through, and to have dealt with, and I can see how that would have been hard, you said that you feel like you stick your neck out for people and then you don't get shit in return, what would you ideally like a friendship to give you in return in that sense?"

What makes you feel like you are not allowed to act on how you feel as well?

Hm, and do you feel you could still have an emotional response, but without experiencing the panic in that way?

Okay, thank you for the example, so in general, when someone doesn't know or doesn't respect that boundary, how do you usually try to enforce it in that sense?
