I still feel really odd about what happened and it seems so unbelievable to look back at it but at the time it was consuming me and really could not snap out."
BipolarReddit,fhimufx,t3_f33hn3,1581627828.0,"I didn't do much damage to my relationship other than an insane amount of cringe/over sharing stuff with people / strangers.  I still cringe about it just thinking about how oddly out there I was.  

I started seeing numbers and thought there was meanings to them, soon after everything had meanings.  Kept seeing symbols and signs everywhere/ I thought I had magical spiritual powers of healing.  
I started doing meditation, bought too many crystals because they ""vibrated"" and I needed them to be protected.  
I kept having visions of my dead dad during my meditations. 
I thought I was a light worker and could help trapped spirits pass to the other side. 
Songs were messages from the other side, facebook posts had a meaning dedicated to me. 

I was trying to fall asleep and I was trying to release a spirit and a snake jumped out the water. 
I thought the spirit attached itself to my third eye.  Woke up and browsed facebook and saw a picture of the grim repear and started to panic. 
I threw away my boots and anything that could have touched this war ground I had visited(had went many times prior and no issues (because that is where I picked up the spirit and it wanted to take my son because the spirit was a mom who had lost her son to war and longed for him). 
I put salt all around my house. 
Then my imagination had me see myself at a funeral of my son and I thought it was a vision of the future. 
I couldn't get rid of said spirit. 
I was full out paranoid and didn't trust anyone with my son. 


I ended up in the emergency tapping my head to close my crown chakra and foot twirling to keep a strong aura to protect myself. 
I could not snap out of it and thought I had anxiety. 
The doctor said my vitals were good and sent me home. 

I struggled until I seen a psychatric who gave me seroquel.

I have not had another psychosis since.

So much embarassment."

BipolarReddit,fhfqlte,t3_ezu7y3,1581549033.0,"This touches home for me; 

I went full blown psychotic,  it started with numbers and meditation/synchrocinity/numerology to hallucinations.  Bottom line was that I was a here to save others from hardship and help others pass to the other side.  I thought I was a light worker. I bought so many rocks and crystals, cause I felt them vibrate in my hands. 
I received messages through songs and symbols, would feel my ""crown"" chakra vibrate and resonate to messages. 
I sat and meditate and seen what I thought was all of my life's hardship into this drawing of a mountain, I drew it within a few minutes. 
Everything began to be a symbol; my speech was crazy; I thought I was special and a saviour on this earth. 

Until one night; I went to sacred grounds and thought a spirit attached itself to me so I threw my boots away and whatever the soil had touched. 

I tried to release said spirit, but in my vision a snake jumped out the water. So it had attached itself to me and wanted to take my son with them. 

I began being paranoid, scared.  I would knock on my head to shut close my chakra and twirl my foot to strenghten my aura.
I could not snap out of it. 
I am now on seroquel and stable other than depressive episode not being managed. 

I am terrefied of anything spiritual now, I still see the same number all the time and I hate it.  

I hope to never go back there."
