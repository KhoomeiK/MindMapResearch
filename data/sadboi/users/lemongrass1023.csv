adderall,fpq5re1,t3_getxlv,1588815717.0,Yes @ the yawning part. When my dose is wearing off and I’m getting close to bed and I need or want to get physically more relaxed I have found that by breathing in through my nose and holding it for a few seconds then exhaling out through my mouth I soon start being able to yawn which really helps me wind down 🥱💤 This also helps if I am experiencing anxiety. Best of luck .

LockdownSkepticism,fo5frab,t1_fo4wtmo,1587524571.0,It means that 50% of the maximum allowable amount of people at any given time so example would be if a grocery store has a capacity of 500 people then 50% capacity would allow only 250 people in as 50% of 500 equals 250.

HealthAnxiety,fo4yk2u,t3_g5ha4y,1587513765.0,"Yeah and I went to the ER for it ( last year ) and truly thought I was about to croak and they ran blood work and EKG and other things and everything came back fine . The physician said that it was possibly costochondritis ( inflammation within the ribs ) and there was no real way to know for sure but anyhow it’s happened a few times since and usually in the mornings (when heart attacks are more common) but when it happens I just try to close my eyes , breathe in through my nose , hold for a few seconds and then exhale slowly through my mouth and remind myself it is more than likely all in my mind or an inflamed rib area but that it’ll pass . I know it can be so scary and I feel your pain and hope it passes quickly for you and everyone else that has this ."

I have decided and a while back actually that I’ll have to deal with my lack of executive functioning and constant intense sleep inertia and other “shortcomings” before going through all that @ what I’ve seen people with legislate reasons being controlled over getting access to. Also Like the other person before me said it is bittersweet indeed.
