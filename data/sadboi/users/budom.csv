CrusaderKings,fomu098,t1_fomehkn,1587903779.0,"> empire-level title

That title doesn't exist until after his brother creates it, plus it's a titular empire title that gets destroyed shortly after creation so it's very unlikely to pass to him even with the death of his brother.

I don't know how the steam mods do it, but this is how I'd convert the lore into de jure titles:

Empire Tier: The Earth Kingdom, which has a Feudal Government Form, Autonomous Vassals, and Kingdom Viceroyalties. It also has an OPM non-viceroyalty vassal Kingdom called Omashu.


Kingdom Tier: Fire Nation, which has Absolute Rule, Full Centralization, Imperial Government Form, and a free ""head sage"" ducal-tier religious title (plus a free Colonist if you complete the first National Idea :P)


Kingdom Tier: The Northern and Southern Water Tribes, which for a long time were two separate titles that nominally belonged to one chief residing in the North Pole. Tribal Government Form, of course.


County Tier: All four scattered Air Nomad lands. They're basically OPMs. But they all have some sort of mixed Nomadic / Monastic Feudal Government Form (minus Raiding) Yes, they don't translate well in the game. Also, one can assume 90% of the population is on a constant pilgrimage/journey and switching between courts. Someone who plays Tibet can probably mention something more accurate?


Also included in County Tier are:

 - The sandbenders in the Desert, with Tribal Form

 - The waterbenders in the Swamp, with Tribal Form

 - Kyoshi island, which is basically like Socotra but for Japanese culture instead of Nestorianism


Titular Titles: 

 - The Avatar, which is a religious Empire tier title lol. The Avatar would also probably have at least four kingdom-tier religious titles (one for each actual religion - ocean/moon worship, fire sages, earth confucianism, straight-up jainism, and maybe even swamp worship and sun worship...  they're all basically Dharmic in that world) due to limitations of the game's engine

 - Phoenix King, as previously mentioned. Only formable if all counties in the Earth Kingdom Regions, the Fire Nation Region, and the Air Nomad Regions are held. 

 - The Earth Empire, which can only be formed if all [currently de jure] Earth Kingdom vassal counties are held, the owner controls Ba Sing Se but isn't the Earth King/Queen, and they have a realm size of a lot.

Edit3: Special mention - Holy Orders, Mercenary companies, and Societies

 - The Dai Li which are like the Scholae Domesticae mixed with the Hashashin and also Chinese

 - The White Lotus, which is clearly both a Society and a Holy Order

 - The Yuyan Archer retinues

 - There's a clear difference between Royal Earth/Fire benders and the rank and file soldiers so those elite troops are probably retinues too


Lots of Mercenaries in the show but few groups are big enough to be called armies so that's actually something that would be difficult to translate into the game. Even the Kyoshi warriors have like ten members max."

It does involve mystical Avatar stuff at first, but it still ends up needing her own insights to finally get the peace of mind she's never truly had, even for just a while.


Ozai indeed doesn't get saved at the end of the show. The whole point of Aang's mercy wasn't that it meant redemption. Rather, it meant that all people should be given a chance to come to terms with their wrongdoing and either start the path to redemption or embrace their evil. Only then is death truly permissible to the wrongdoer, but even then the ones who embraced their evil might pull a Vader by doing a last-minute redemption at some point in the future.

Ozai, stripped of what made him blind to his megalomania and probably forced to think about how he was abused by his father and how he has dealt the same abuse to many others, now has that opportunity.

Like, Gina's whole ""I'm a filthy civilian"" schtick helped balance out the bourgeois stereotypes that we sometimes see in Santiago, Holt, and Boyle. Without that, these cops feel just a bit more unrelatable to the viewer.


Jake can't balance that because even with his wacky side he'll still be a cop (especially evident in this season's Doug Judy episode)


Terry can't fix that either because he's already got his own ""self-actualized father of three"" role pinned down plus he got promoted to an even more respectable rank in recent episodes


Rosa is trying her hardest but it's far from enough, especially after she went soft

Aaaand Hitchcock and Scully are funny and genuine at times, but they're also the sort of detectives that Commissioner Gordon has to deal with on a regular basis because Batman keeps leaving them hanging upside down. I don't think they're corrupt, but they're still basically stereotypical cops.


I think I overdid my analysis, but my point remains: Gina didn't just play the snarky always-right witch, she was also sometimes the audience surrogate and straight-man when every other character (except Rosa and Jake) was exaggerating their role."

It's similar to how a culture of sexism isn't caused solely by sexist men but includes the many women who accept the sexism as a natural part of society. It's partly why many female monarchs throughout history never even tried to suggest gender equality as a law: they saw themselves as powerful honorary men instead of as powerful women."

I mean, both departures are understandable I guess (especially with the case of TJ Miller basically writing himself out of the show due to his own issues on set) but man... if a third of your soul is ripped out and never returns or grows back, can you still call yourself the same person?"
civ,fn27cxr,t1_fn133qq,1586579899.0,"""Fighters"" is an understatement. They're more Amazonian than the actual Scythians that the Amazons were based on. If you visited Sparta when there were few men (which often happened during war), you'd be visiting a Patriarchal society run by women.


Spartan women were both more feminine and more masculine than the usually-venerated Athenian philosopher-politicians"
