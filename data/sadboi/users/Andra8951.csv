All of the mental health community knows that this is intense and they are working extra hard to help people emotionally as well as physically. The urgent care worker is a jerk, just because he/she didn't handle your situation with smart/thoughtful care doesn't mean other people aren't around to help. Crisis text lines are the best...

EatingDisorders,fliltx0,t3_fmk8et,1585185300.0,"The thing is that it's up to you to decide. If you feel like crap about your relationship with food, try to tackle it as just that. Labeling yourself prematurely could be counterproductive yet if it's become that disturbing that you may need someone to talk to about it then by all means do it! I consider myself someone with an eating disorder. I have friends and family and medical professionals say ha ha very funny. I also have friends that ask me if I've eaten and people have been worried that I absolutely have a problem. It's how you view it that is what is important. All I can say is you deserve to enjoy life, feel happy and healthy in a way that is true to you, however that looks in the mirror or what's on your plate. Sometimes it helps to talk to loved ones and other times a neutral person would be more effective. Either way, we all empathize, and care that you are well in all the ways. I'm glad you came to a safe place and I'm glad that you expressed your thoughts and feelings. You clearly have a lot of self-awareness and are trying to keep yourself well, and that is a HUGE first step. A lot of times people wait to address it and ask for some help or guidance (guilty!) but you have done it in a healthy way early on. You are doing great, I wish you the very best and I'll tell you something I need to tell myself: there is more right with you than wrong with you. Anyone on here I'm sure is willing to listen and share their experience. Always good to have healthy concern, but try not to make it into an obsessive panic. We are ALL with you. One tip: mindfulness meditation and yoga if you are more physical person. Changed my life. There are a lot of apps out there but the best by far is called insight timer and I think it might be a few bucks a month (it was free when I signed up) you can get tens of thousands of meditations of all types by thousands of different teachers, and I know there are at least a handful of crash courses that target what you seem to be going through. I still have a long way to go, but I can't tell you how much better I am since I started about two years ago. There is another book I read before I had a physical activity mindfulness practice, it was short and sweet and are little tips on how to deal with and improve any and every problem relationship you feel you may have with food. I just am bouncing back from a ""relapse"" now, which is why I really care about helping you so that you don't have to go through what a lot of us did to end up on this thread. That said I am going to try to find the title and please feel free to reach out if you need. I'm quarantined in New York City Coronaland so I have all the time to help in any way if I can. Stay strong, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF because you can be okay, you already are, and you deserve to be happy and healthy ALWAYS. Praying for your peace of mind. If nothing else please believe this one fact you need to know: You are not alone. ♡♡♡"

I wouldn't ignore them for long... writing helps, any kind of exercise or mindfulness meditation will maybe get you more in touch with whatever is going on. Sometimes we need to kind of detach from our thoughts and feelings because it's safer that way, other times you have to go right in and face it head-on and investigate/assess the situation. You probably have a leaning towards which is healthier for your psyche at the moment, either way might need another person to go through the stuff with you in a safe, calm, and patient way.

Almost like I'm buying time, because the rest of the world is having to slow down at the same time as me, so no FOMO which is something to be grateful for. And with the market doing what it's doing, again it may be crappy of me but now I'm not the only one scared about finances, even though my personal finances are really screwed from my illness, a lot of other just normal people are jobless, losing investments... maybe that is all kind of terrible, but it feels like I am riding out a wave and I'm much more under the radar because everyone else happens to be all caught up in the same tide.

Actually both, including percocet... the last few times I felt high but miserable at the fact that I was high and all I could do was stare at my legs at the end of the bed and scratch everywhere for hours and feel like death afterwards. Fentanyl though, no one even said it was laced dope. I sniffed 1/2 of a pea sized bump and in 4 minutes I was exhausted and scratching everywhere for hours on end. ZERO recreation in that. I mean if it were heroin it would have been the same but it was >10x stronger. It was only afterwards that I put 2 and 2 together and realized that was in no way heroin.

I have been there, and I actually hate to admit with one friend at a young age, before I knew I would get hit with it, I was on the other side of it. So I'm not mad at anyone. No one knows how to fix things sometimes and it is basically then a shitty situation about an already shitty situation. Maddening is right. And yes, I do feel so guilty sometimes because maybe I'm not trying hard enough and a lot of other people have it worse and maybe I'm minimizing it and not letting people in and maybe I am overwhelming and expecting too much.

I'm not sure how to make it go away, I have a few times but when you are in it you can't imagine even the possibility of getting back up because you will just fall back down. I *do not* know how or where this ends, and I pray to God that it does for everyone suffering first- and secondhand. I think though at least it's a long shot... the conversation will never be over but we can go deeper and get more raw and vulnerable, we can get louder and share and *at the very least* assure each other and know that we are not alone, and that there is power in numbers and if we are strong together and are focused on solutions and small victories we can shrink this beast and the power it has over us. It will take time and it will never be gone--it is cancer without the biopsies. But we can give ourselves and each other credit for doing the best we can with what we have at the time.

Because it is hard and you kind of have to have a thick skin and strong will to get the it well and benefit, I know that sounds weird but being armored with knowledge is always best. You can refuse medication, I should point out, if you feel unsafe taking it. I have a hard time with meds and often the doctor wanted to move things around. But I knew I was safe so if he wanted to try a new approach I just let him and the rest of the staff know that I felt scared but I was trying to trust that they wouldn't let anything happen to me. One night I had a not awesome reaction, but there were people I could talk to and the doctor switched the next day. It's ALL about communication in there. Communication, patience, and remembering to see the big picture. I am feeling a little better, at the very least I'm not taking any substances so right there is a good thing. Still lots of work to be done but again keeping the big picture in mind and staying focused helps when things get rough."
mentalhealth,fkhswkd,t1_fkgwrby,1584205370.0,"I try to explain it to people that ""it's like I am getting up to stand and do things(wash myself) and then turn on the faucet and I feel like the water is attacking my face."" Ha, I know it's not. And 90% of the time I feel better afterwards but really, same as going outside, I feel like the sun is screaming at my face. I wrote this for those kinds of reasons. Often I can't even put the TV on. So teensy things, like dry shampoo help. You're doing something but you aren't forcing yourself into doing something that is supposed to make you feel good, even though just the thought of it is overwhelming."

I'm more sandwich gen so even speaking on Tony Soprano feels like I'm cheating a little... I think if I watched it live with the rest of America it would have been different (I always explain this when I talk to people about LOST... I say don't worry about even watching it if you can't ""OMG"" with half of the internet the next day)... but it's hard to say with him.  He had his one unshakable perfect character... Leo and Christian Bale have never been the same entity more than once.  And they are the contemporary Greats, not quite in the vein of Tom Hanks and DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman who weren't even comparable to Brando... I think people get way too mixed up in ""best actor"" vs ""best actor in his time/genre"" and there is the best actor in terms of making a most memorable character, vs best actor in terms of versatility... so many variables... hahahah I am rambling but I am on a rewatch and about to finish season 1 today and excited excited.  I'd love to hear Bryan Cranston on Tony Soprano.  I didn't dig into Breaking Bad like other shows, but I saw enough reminiscent of genius that I don't deny that sentiment at all... now I want to watch it just because I want to see Cranston drawing on Gandolfini's performance and David Chase's Soprano... even though I never got into it, I could now!!!"

Hope you're feeling better or at the very least going easy on yourself if you are feeling like shit.  You don't have to explain or validate yourself and feelings and thoughts to anyone (including yourself.)  If you feel like shit, you feel like shit.    You don't have to know why, or decide whether or not it is right or wrong, just try to do something to feel better and if you can't just enjoy splashing in your puddle.

I have been practicing yoga for three years and the teachers that I appreciate the most and truly have so much love for are the people who really didn't care that my legs were shaking, or that my breath was jagged, that I was basically having a panic attack on my mat.  And the best therapists don't really do anything other than let you hear your own crazy talk until you talk yourself in circles around the truth and then you realize you kind of knew you were okay all along.  I'd much rather feel empowered than healed.  I'm so very much in the same boat right now, thanks for sharing!"

mentalhealth,fkegt35,t1_fk3loba,1584112884.0,"Maybe it is because I am 32, and when I was last there I was in my early twenties, in a terrible relationship and in a really bad place... I didn't trust anyone (and still don't)--I was hurting myself with substances but not enough for a rehab or detox to take me in, so I said someone please keep me from myself.  Again maybe it's because I have learned meditation and yoga, maybe it is because I have matured and learned better communication skills and coping skills... the difference was the people.  If I looked close enough no matter who I was around I realized that everyone (everyone) cared and only wants you to feel better.  Which sometimes includes them allowing you to feel worse.  I had a hard time one day and was talking to a nurse and I was in self reflection and I said ""I mean if I didn't have a hard time in here I really wouldn't need to be in the hospital in the first place.""  But from the doctors, to the nurses and CNAs (who basically fill in as mom, dad, therapist... you can talk to them about anything if they have time they will listen.) all the way down to the cleaning staff, you know everyone is there for healing.  And although you are around people that may frighten or disturb you there are almost always people you can relate to and kind of have a crew and another group of people to talk to (and help) when things get rough.  It is very hospital-like, so it is acute, and there is a lot of time.  I had to learn to get creative with my time and I expressed that I was having a hard time, and how boredom turned into depression really fast and staff and other patients pitched in (instead of just a movie night we also started an uno game night.)  IT TOOK A WHILE THOUGH.  Med changes were rough.  But again, no one is ever in a hospital feeling good, so you have to take it in context, and reframe it, and try to see how it is worth it.  If anyone is going inpatient or does, I would advise to really be mindful about visitors as it may make things more difficult emotionally, much more, for most people or so I've seen.  I kept in contact with my family on the phone but they didn't know the details of the pain I felt and I didn't need to know that I was missing out on a sunny day.  And I didn't have to hug them goodbye.  Another thing, they will take many of your personal items for safety reasons.  Usually no shoelaces, minimal jewelry if any (I was allowed to wear my cross), no drawstrings on hoodies... there are a lot of other specifics.  The main point I'd like to make is that you \*are\* going into a depressing environment--you don't want to let this make your depression worse, and chances are it is NOT going to get better there, but it should put it to a halt if things get really bad.  So if things are really bad?  Talk to family and friends and call crisis lines and google like crazy, and THEN if you can't know for sure that you won't get in the way of hurting yourself, check yourself in.  And then once you're there, keep reminding yourself why and try and stay focused.  I guess that's the most I can share about the experience now... I could share a lot more, but I hope this helps shine a light on things.  Bless you."

Drugs,fbnncz5,t3_edrxt5,1577000405.0,"I'm going to respectfully disagree with almost everyone here, lol... I have been in the same situation and on both many times, for a long time (to everyone else yes, I think I might be on them for life and I wish that someone had only prescribed a small dose for a short amount of time.)  WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU IS WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU.  Whatever you can take most minimally and feel most yourself and lucid with, absolutely Klonopin in that case. For me Klonopin just lasted way too long, everything felt like a haze and fog all day long, and days would just pass by into the next.  I've been on Xanax for about two years now and am much more stable, once I switched it didn't take long to see the results.  I think if you have the self-awareness to only benzo-up when you are just about to \*truly\* panic, I go with the Xanax.  I have learned so many techniques to cope with and form my life and relationships around my ever-present feelings of anxiety (meditation and yoga, seriously, seriously, seriously.)  And am usually able to take it less often.  For me it's just easier, I personally feel more lucid, or at least I have more control over all of it.  It really comes down to self-awareness and self-control.  Stay honest with yourself and your doctor, don't give up.  Try meditation!!!  I hope that helps though, stay well!  Everyone else too, benzos totally suck to be addicted to but it's cool we can all help each other out. :) Peace and Love."

Drugs,f1sjo7x,t3_daf48r,1569729809.0,"I am currently reading Pathways to Bliss by Joseph Campbell and he was discussing Jungian philosophy and psychology... four?  types of something? (I'm writing this late on a lot of cocaine and a little bit of xanax) and there is a subtype of person who lives purposely on the periphery.  Which... why do any of us do the things that we do?  I personally hate being inebriated, I am in love with the transcendental states of consciousness that come with very long and diligent meditation practice or intense physical exercise/exertion i.e. sex, super marathons... it's a matter of wanting to do things on our own, on our own terms, and fuck off to everyone else.  If you got into (or are into) a natural state of euphoria, you'd (we'd) think that drugs were boring and it was much more fun to get to those states using our own brains.  It's a matter of doing what we want when we want and Reality Is Not Our Jam.  It could be reasons for attention, or just because truly, reality is not our jam.  I find this a lot with trauma survivors, I identify as one too and I dissociate often.  I stopped at a green light the other day, it was scary.  Something else, controlled, i.e. staying up for days straight, fasting... these all are states of being that make the world around us seem different.  And we crave that.  I think most of us psychonauts are just looking to think differently, more creatively, make a mark because We Thought Of It First.  I can say firsthand not looking forward to the comedown, not enjoying the high or my nose feeling bothered, but kind of (even if it's stemming from masochism) way doing something different was my activity for the night, that brought me to other things.  Not knowing what's going to happen, the ""what would happen if I..."" phenomenon.  It's not abnormal, it's completely natural.  The people who follow the rules (or at least pretend to) or the people who really \*love\* I mean are in \*love\* with heroin in specific, it's another story.  But to constantly want to change realities, substances... it's something we all want.  People buy the newer clothes, televisions, strive for the highest-up jobs because they are superficially trying to produce a heightened state just like we are, we are just being more direct aaaand so I believe more virtuous and why libertarians should rule the world. :)"

It did the one thing that cleared out my mind: made me cry. No, at a point logic doesn't work. You remember you're human and it's weird but the tears feel so good. It's like eating healthy food, you enjoy it so much because you are satisfying your physiological (/psychological) needs.
