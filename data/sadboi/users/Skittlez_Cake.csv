A kiddo from a balcony with their parent caught my attention when he said, "" Hello! Hi there! Look up it's me!"" I waved at the kid and parent and felt more confident about the field I'm going into. Which is being a counselor/ therapist to children in need."

My bf and I are both broke college students and honestly in moments when we both know we don't have the funds to spoil eachother we just surprise eachother with hand made gifts. 

Your gf is being immature."

I have a hemangioma birthmark on my upper right arm. When I wear short cut sleeves is when I notice grown adults just stare at it. I guess sometimes from far away it'll look like a tattoo so I've been told. Doesn't change the fact that it's weird seeing strangers just stare at you."

love,fb8dg1y,t3_ebrk0m,1576611517.0,"My partner was hanging out with a girl he already knew I clearly disliked for almost 2 months before I found out. Broke me to pieces, I was going through depression and just a lot of things... And finding that out broke my heart. We are still together after 6 years and that incident was 2-3 years ago. We reconciled idk how but we did, he promised me nothing happened because the other girl apparently had a bf. That still didn't make it feel any better. I can honestly say I have forgiven him and he has tried everything to help me trust him. We are still together and luckily things have not gotten worse but have gotten for better. He understood my needs/ wants for the relationship to continue and he respected that. Nothing fishy has happened since, and I can honestly say our relationship is great and we share our love for each other every day. Whenever he has free time he will spend it with me. He will surprise me with flowers and coffee every now and again. Make me breakfast when he comes home from work. Tell me he loves me every day and makes me feel loved. I can't say he cheated and the relationship got better. But I think if both parties want to continue they can make it work. Tbh I would not have taken him back if I had found signs of cheating the text message I read where of them hanging out after a class in college and smoke and stuff and as far as I know he drove her home once because she didn't have a ride. I trust that he didn't do anything because she had a bf but you can see how it was difficult to get past either way. I hope this offers insight. We are still together and I moved in with him in August and things have been great."

If you enjoy being an adult baby and have a tantrum on the road ... There is no hope for you. It's like they say, patience is a virtue."

ActualWomen,f609qqg,t3_dps46l,1572610929.0,"Your concerned that biological females don't have a safe space? Explain that a little more because all it seems to me is that the sex ed is being more inclusive now. What I can't agree with is that you think us Cis women don't have a safe space. We really do, we have our own bathrooms our own places where we are socially acceptable at. While members of the LGBTQ community are still shunned in public.. 

I have a younger sister who has told me she is bisexual she is 12. She wants to have more boy clothes and cut her hair short. It's been hard for me to try and talk to my mom about letting her cut her hair like a boy's. Things like this shouldnt be hard. It should be simple, my sister should be able to talk to my mom about how she feels about herself. But she can't because she doesn't feel safe.

I hope this example gives you a look on how others need their safe space to."

ActualWomen,f3da7cu,t1_f3byshv,1570833826.0,Why are people downvoting you? Lol you can't force your partner to see certain therapist or Doctors etc.. that's controlling and unhealthy in a relationship.
ActualWomen,f3da2ft,t1_f3c4rr5,1570833775.0,It's definitely over stepping.
ActualWomen,f3d9v2a,t3_dgiod3,1570833701.0,You can't force your boyfriend to do anything ... Let him know how you feel about this. Then it's up to him to decide wether he wants to continue with this therapist or not. Joe Rogan interviewed Jordan Peterson on his podcast I definitely recommend you watch it to get a better sense of who he is as a person ( not saying I like the guy ) I think assuming who the therapist person is as a person based of this blog post he is a bit harsh. You can be friends with people with opposing views so long as both parties respect one another. I hope your bf listens to how you feel about this but please remember your partner has a choice in this as well.

I've been feeling the same in a sense that I feel detached and find myself thinking of old traumas for absolutely no reason. Even though I am a Leo Rising this energy is really intense.
