I think one of the top buyers of Chinese garlic was Christopher ranch.

BPD,fc054r8,t3_efdkci,1577279004.0,"I struggle with it. I think it comes from the fact that as a kid I was always told to cover up, not even from a religious family.anything with short sleeves, dresses, leggings, crop tops. I was told I couldn't wear them and that it didn't look good on me. Anytime I would go out with an outfit that didn't cover me properly my parents would fight with me to change until I gave in. I started covering up without them telling me I started to hate my barely there curves and I would wear baggy clothes to hide myself. 

So seeing so many people be so happy with how they look naked and in revealing clothes I feel so jealous that I can't be like them. I hate that they get love and attention for being their true selves while I was thought I had to cover up because no one wants to look at me"

CleaningTips,f3ao6bb,t1_f39ja71,1570782910.0,"Not a cleaning tip and maybe not a helpful one but dogs shed because of light, sometimes if a dog is shedding a lot all the time is because the lights in your house can be confusing them. Presumably, when you're gone during the day your dog is seeing natural light then it gets a bit darker and they know it's going into night time, then when you get home you turn all the lights on meaning to them day time again. 

Do you have the main lights of the house on till you go to bed? You could maybe you could try having low lights on after 8 or 9 and see if the shedding decreases."
