BPD,fqcqt36,t3_gi3isg,1589265925.0,"Oh god yes. Very much so. I don’t even have any social media anymore, it became to toxic for me. I had to get rid of it all because of my jealousy issues. I was jealous of people who got to graduate from college and get good jobs. I had to drop out cause I wasn’t able to juggle supporting myself and class cause my family wouldn’t help me at all. Jealous of people who can maintain happy relationships. Jealous of people with good families. Jealous of girls with nice bodies while i don’t have what guys normally like. Stuff like that. I am so bitter and it drives me up a wall. I know it’s bad, but deleting my social media, especially Instagram and Facebook really helped me a lot. I feel like I’m so behind and such a loser compared to everyone else. I just wish I could get a college degree or have a family that loves me, maintain a happy relationship, SOMETHING. But nope, I’m a loser who makes minimum wage and has a family who could care less if they live or die, and I’ll probably never get married and that’s just how it be. I know it could be much worse, i could be homeless like i was this time last year, but ugh. Man. It sucks."

Like sure, that may have worked for them, but it’s easier said than done for people like us. I get that they are just trying to help, but it’s a lot more complex than that. It may help certain people sure but it’s def not for everyone. Anyone who understands BPD though would know that’s not really going to help. DBT helps us more than anything. Not working out."
BorderlinePDisorder,fo9t33f,t1_fo9t0h3,1587630191.0,I know!! I posted in a subreddit about a show I like and got downvoted for no reason and just deleted my comment cause of it. I don’t get why I got downvoted. I didn’t say anything wrong?

BPD,fo9sjjn,t3_g61u5j,1587629641.0,Yes but I’m honestly at peace when I don’t have an FP. I prefer being single and stuff because I don’t have to worry about the anxiety of being abandoned and deal with the fights and and all that

BPD,fmkln0z,t3_fvuc8f,1586159286.0,"Nope. I’m the opposite. I hate relationships. They make my anxiety way worse. I can’t enjoy relationships bc the whole time i worry. I’m terrified of even being in one now. I have gotten to a point where i can’t even develop romantic feelings for someone anymore. But i guess it’s bc my past relationships have been shit, though. Every one I’ve been in have been abusive and/or toxic ones. So I feel much better when I’m single. I’m happier and feel safe that way. That way I don’t have to worry about someone hurting, cheating, or abandoning me. It’s a weird defense mechanism I’ve started to have after all the trauma i guess. I still have FP though, don’t get me wrong, they just are in good friends. But what you have isn’t uncommon at all with BPD, i am probably the uncommon one here."
