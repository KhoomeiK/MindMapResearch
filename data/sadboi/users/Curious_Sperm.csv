also when he escapes from the train incident with a raging force of panic and terror and reaches this room where he performs this slow dance for the first time and it seems like a form of release and being instilled by a different entity that he transitions into who's doesn't abide conformity and society norms and is free of concern.   
also the one in his apartment when as it seems like his friends from past work show up to company Arthur in his grief  but rather for their self-protection of pride and honour that was disrupted due to joker train incident and how that moment escalates from congeniality to sheer brutality to awkward humour it shows how remarkable it gets when madness and brilliance coincide.
