Magnesium is vital for when you’re on keto, helps you feel so much better and helps with the side effects. With inositol, I order through amazon, girls on this forum taught me about it I tried it and saw my weight loss spike after a couple of months on it."

I was always overweight ever since I was 8, but really ballooned in my teens/20’s. I was put on birth control and a low dosage of metformin but it didn’t help. In fact, I ended up getting pregnant! I was able to have two kids without any IVF or any support to conceive. Just last year, I got put on magnesium, 2000mg of metformin, birth control, and inositol. I also was prescribed a 1200 calorie keto diet. I started at 310lbs and am now 230lb. It’s been a life changer being able to finally lose weight because there hasn’t been a chance for me before. Hope that’s helpful!"

Edit, update from doctor:
We got to talk to the doctor. She’s still septic and he’s pretty confident it’s from her legs. She’s on several antibiotics to try to kill the infection but they’re not sure what the bug is so they’re covering their bases. Her lungs are clear and heart looks ok but her labs show some cardiac stress. Nothing concerning, just to keep an eye on since her body is under a lot of stress."
