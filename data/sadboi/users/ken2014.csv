MadeMeSmile,fqraa1g,t3_gkhyip,1589580518.0,I bought my first home with my husband three years ago in July. It was truly one of the happiest moments of my life. Congratulations!
stopsmoking,fqra1au,t3_gki02z,1589580391.0,"I dont have any advice on your gums except see a doctor. But as far as quitting goes.. I used chantix (champix) and I'm four months smoke free. I truly never thought I would quit. I thought I was doomed to die at 50 from lung cancer because I iust didnt want to quit. Then I took chantix and it still took me 3 months on the chantix to quit.. but I did it. You can do it too. There are lots of meds and  nrt to help. Do some research. I know I can still relapse (we all can) but the longer I'm quit the easier it gets

You will quit when you're ready. I know you will. But first get to that doctor!"
stopsmoking,fqr7r2l,t1_fqnm4jq,1589579170.0,Since I was 16.. I'm 30 now so 14 years
stopsmoking,fqnlyz7,t3_gjsewt,1589497240.0,I quit with chantix (champix in other countries). I also chugged a shit load of water any time I craved and then ate a bunch of snap peas and carrots. Crunchy veggies and water for the win! You got this and we got your back
stopsmoking,fqnlqja,t3_gjsy4j,1589497119.0,Drink a shit load of water.. I mean like 3 liters a day. And eat snap peas and carrots any time you crave.. then chug water

stopsmoking,fqnjmjx,t1_fqngm4k,1589496032.0,1 month cravings will lessen but I'm four months in and I still crave a little bit.. my dad says a year to be totally okay without cigs
stopsmoking,fqnjikh,t3_gju7p3,1589495975.0,Intense cravings can last for up to a month due to physical withdrawal symptoms.. after that it's all mental and the cravings arent as bad
stopsmoking,fqn7h2z,t3_gjttia,1589489959.0,"I was quit for a month or two and had lost my urge to smoke. Then lockdown happened and I found myself screaming at my husband that I needed a cig. But I did not cave and the urges eventually went away. I'm still in lockdown and now I barely think about smoking. 

There will always be a reason not to quit.. stress will always be there. You just have to do it. 

You can do this.. lockdown or no lockdown.. you got this"
stopsmoking,fqn74fk,t3_gju7p3,1589489791.0,Average craving lasts 15 minutes but I have had some that have lasted for 30 minutes. But they never last forever so just stay strong. You can do this
stopsmoking,fqn6y0o,t3_gjud33,1589489705.0,"So this is definitely for most people a part of the withdrawal. If you cant handle it I recommend nicotine replacement therapy (patches, gum, lonzenges) or a medication like chantix. I couldn't handle the withdrawal and the strong urges to smoke so I finally asked my doctor for chantix and I am now four months quit. The chantix made withdrawal symptoms virtually non existent. Sure it was still hard to quit but not as hard as cold Turkey. 

You just have to find what works for you. No matter what you choose, I know you can do this."

BipolarReddit,fqms6b4,t1_fqmn1cf,1589482634.0,This. No one has to do anything but it's a really smart idea to medicate bipolar
Anxiety,fqmhuuy,t3_gjqw2a,1589477699.0,Anxiety is a side effect of anti depressants and should go away when your body adjusts to the medication. But definitely talk to your doctor he/she may be able to help

BipolarReddit,fqfc25n,t3_gilhxy,1589322248.0,Seroquel gave me awful suicidal thoughts but zyprexa is my miracle drug
stepparents,fqfb9bb,t3_gillr0,1589321848.0,"I could not imagine if my dad told me I couldnt come to his house. I'm just being honest.. I really think his kids should be able to come over at anytime even unannounced. That is their house too and that is their dad. They should be welcomed with open arms

Now, maybe I'm a little opinionated here because I have my ss 24/7 365 days a year. But even before that I felt like ss had a second home here and could be here whenever he wanted. I married his father knowing he had a kid, so yeah I expect to be sharing a home with him. 

As for having to clean up after the kids... that is not your job and you should not have to do it ESPECIALLY because you are pregnant."

stopsmoking,foi6a5q,t1_foi6574,1587779596.0,Maybe just call your doctors office and tell them what you're experiencing?
stopsmoking,foi4bnh,t3_g7k1f6,1587778433.0,Chances are its withdrawal but if youre concerned you should go to a doctor. But I expect you'll feel better in a week or two
Anxiety,foi33qq,t3_g7klq8,1587777732.0,"Your lexapro should fully work in about 6 weeks. In the meantime, I would say it's okay to use benzos. It's just for a short time and when you get the right dose of lexapro in you you will probably not need the benzos. I'm on lexapro and it works like a charm. I have very little anxiety these days

If you are scared of dependency you should talk to your doctor and decide together what the best plan is"
stopsmoking,foi11ej,t3_g7kbwk,1587776531.0,Yayyyy!!!!
stepparents,fofxshs,t3_g743si,1587744681.0,"We have always had separate bank accounts. We used to split the bills evenly but overtime my husband started to make WAY more money than I do. I have a bachelor's in psychology so I make peanuts. My husband now pays for the bulk of the bills except for my credit card, my student loan, my car payment and my health insurance. I cover bills for myself and he covers bills for the household.

As far as money for my ss goes (we dont have any bio kids right now) I dont mind buying him clothes and presents and things. Our relationship is different than most step relationships though in that I'm more of a mom because his mom isn't involved much. A random phone call to her son here and there but she doesn't pay cs, isn't involved with his education, therapy or discipline and she sees him maybe once a year if that (she lives across the country). So I've had to step into the role of mom. A lot of people on here will probably have a problem with me saying that but idc it's the way it is in our family. So I dont mind paying for necessities for ss if I just happen to be out and see clothes on sale etc."
BipolarReddit,fofw65r,t3_g7arxc,1587743877.0,"I hear you. I've had one manic episode back in 2011. In 2013 I went off my mood stabilizer and immediately flew into a crazy hypomania that I didnt recognize as hypomania until months later. I've stayed on my meds ever since so I havent experiences any big manic/hypomanic episodes. I've had a week here and there with extra energy and little sleep but nothing huge. Now the depression, that's a different story. I get depressed very easily.

So my point in sharing all that was to let you know that I am kind of in the same boat and I often doubt my diagnosis. I just look back at 2013 and 2011 and remember what I went through and what the consequences were. The reason you're not having manic episodes is probably because you're medicated. Keep it that way. You dont need to prove anything. If the meds are working, just let them"

I've been hospitalized three times and have always needed a med adjustment after the hospital. You may need to have your meds adjusted.

Hang in there and stay strong my friend. This too shall pass"
