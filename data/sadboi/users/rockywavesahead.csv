AdviceAnimals,eyjfqff,t3_cx1ahp,1567118267.0,"Fucking this.  Ive spent the last 5 years not celebrating it and the whole time she tried finding work arounds. Like giving a gift the day before or not technically saying happy bday. Drove me nuts and just made me dig in my heels harder. 

Actually had the nerve to say its not just a day for me, it has meaning to her too. I should have been an ass and told her to go celebrate it herself then."

SelfHarmScars,ey4mg3k,t1_ey3lzrn,1566797685.0,"My husband of 10 years knew me when I had none. He says it doesn't bother him,  but idk. Really if your scars are a deal breaker fir him,  dealing with the emotions behind the scars could be too much for him, but then again i don't know him"
SelfHarmScars,ey4ksr6,t3_cvfc6q,1566795895.0,"My thighs are a mess... Both are covered in scars. I don't think I'll ever wear a skirt or dress again in my life cause of it. *Hug from someone in your spot. We'll make it somehow.

Edit* Try silicon lube on your scars, its nearly the same as scar gel"
SuicideWatch,ey41aae,t3_cvfaqb,1566779163.0,Your entire post is nearly me 100%. Sigh... Would be nice just to not wake up.
SuicideWatch,ey3d0w1,t1_ey36rac,1566761325.0,Money. The treatment we need is paid for out of pocket.  It's 3500 usd... There is no way we could pay for both at once and we have no insurance. It's just a shitty situation
relationships,exv3uxb,t1_extz3o9,1566592274.0,This should be at the top.
raisedbynarcissists,exugg8w,t1_ext5jlr,1566583472.0,"Sigh... I'm so sick of having to explain my upbringing and defending myself.  Every fucking time I tell the same stories, the same slient wide eye, mouth stare follows. 

I try to understand that some people have such amazing parents that they struggle to understand the depths of abuse that commonly happen. Too sheltered perhaps."
SuicideWatch,exubnwz,t1_exu0y0m,1566581770.0,"This. I hate how people think if someone is cutting themselves for attention it isnt as serious. Healthy minded people do not cut themselves for attention. If someone is cutting, no matter the reason, something is very wrong.

*Source long time cutter since 14, 28 now."
AskReddit,exhl5ad,t1_exhdm6a,1566307990.0,"If he is stuck, you could assume its likely a tight cave, or spot at best. People struggle moving a dead body into a trunk already, so how could they drag a dead body through a cave? Also I remember reading that the guy wasn't excatly petite. Its an impossible feat that would caused more deaths.

At least it being his tomb will save lives of others from attempting what he did."

raisedbynarcissists,exfbj7o,t1_exco5xl,1566236951.0,"Thank you for sharing :) I'm 28 myself and have never told a soul about this, other than my husband, and honestly when I posted I was terrified of judgment. It is an incredible amount of relief to hear of others who had or are sharing the same struggles.

It's horrible how something we have no control over is a cause of embarrassment, as if  dealing with the non stop clean up wasn't hard enough."
raisedbynarcissists,exf9gmx,t1_exciqhs,1566235657.0,"It was exactly the same with me!!! Im so sorry your mom chopped it up to being lazy :/ It's amazing how parents justify things in their head. As if waking up in cold piss, soaked cloths & bed is the 'lazy' way to pee."
raisedbynarcissists,ex0d4zd,t1_evysz5l,1565910106.0,"In my home growing up there werent doors on the bedrooms...My 2 other sisters and I shared a room right across the hall from my parents...We all heard a loooot. Often. The words 'yea, that's the shit' are etched into my head...sigh.

Is this sexual abuse? Ive often wondered if this is what caused my older sisters to touch each other and eventually attepmt on me as well."
