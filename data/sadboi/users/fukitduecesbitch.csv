Embrace who you are because you're amazing!!! I don't know you, but I can tell from your post you're a freaking awesome person, beautiful soul, and one heck of a warrior!!! 

You've been fighting for a long time, why would you give up now? You're closer than you think you finding your own self love and acceptance. Hang on. Go slow. Speak to yourself kindly. Look in the mirror and confidently say out loud "" I love you"" ""I haven't come all the way to give up on me now""

Be gentle to yourself. Things will change. Seek yourself. That's where your happiness is, within you.

Shit that's a heck of a lot more than many can say. That's more than I can say. Be proud of yourself. Life is hard and when you're feeling like you do it makes things overwhelming. 

I can't tell you what to do or how to do it. You have to. 

Crummy I know, but then again, who wants to be told what to do, where to go, how to look, feel, eat, breath, etc..... that would make you a puppet. 

You have free will. Do as you want. Be kind to yourself. Focus on being healthy. Studies. LIFE as YOU want it to be. It's not anyone else's painting it's yours.... maybe take a step back to see the bigger picture and then go back to the details? No matter how you look at it, it's YOUR painting. YOUR picture. See/Paint what you want. All paintings have different shading , some parts are darker others are light. If spending time on the ""darker""shades is becoming mundane, then pick up a different color and paint somewhere else on the canvas of your life. 

It's good you keep telling yourself it will get better. It will. I don't know you, but you have what you need to see your life through to the end. Not your timing end, but the end and you can/will feel happiness. You're working through things right now. It's not going to be so soul Crushing forever. Why? Because YOU won't let it. 

It will be ok. Don't give up on you. Your abilities, accomplishments, goals, dreams, the excitement that awaits you once you've moved through this growing experience. Take a break from the constant cycle of disruptive thoughts. Those thoughts are not truthful. They're your fears. We all have fears, but when we continually feed the fear, it grows and cause a lot of unnecessary stress. Feed the honest truth of who you are. Sometimes it's hard to speak to yourself kindly, but it's an action that takes practice, time, and patience.....  Acceptance.

You have to look at yourself every day. Don't allow your parents to live through you regardless of the misdirected the emotions become. You are an adult and honestly you've had the ability to make/ choose your own path this entire time. 

It all goes back to programming. Not saying your parents are bad cuz they're not. They simply tried their best and wanted only the best for you, but sometimes they're wrong. That's ok. We're only human. When you become a parent I'm positive you'll scar your children too 
We all do we simply pray that it's not as bad as it was for us/ you growing up. 

I've learned recently that I've made my child feel as if she had to be perfect. That she was on a pedestal one that was so high that she couldn't handle it. My intentions were good. I didn't want her to feel that way. I wanted her to see what I saw.... freaking greatness!!! The ability to be and do anything and everything and I pushed her too hard, not truly knowing.

You're stronger than you give yourself credit for. Life does have many enjoyable things to offer. 

So before you dive into death giving up. Take a step back and assess your situation. What Have you done to get better, to be happy? Why did it fail? What other things were you doing that were working against you? 

There are so many horrible outcomes to what you are thinking or are going to do. None of which will benefit you. 

Please give yourself a chance. A real chance. God did NOT put you here to suffer. So dig into the core of yourself and take care of it. Do the work that's hard in order to heal. 

Let's talk before you jump."
SuicideWatch,f3h9ehw,t3_dh0394,1570920622.0,You and me both.
SuicideWatch,f3ge03v,t3_dgybxb,1570910213.0," what are you afraid of by telling your therapist the truth? You're safe there. If you're at a point where the things you've been aren't working for you. Then why not throw the dice with a professional. What's the worst that could happen? It doesn't work? Big whoop. 

What's the best and most likely outcome? 

You get better!! You heal from your trauma. You find other medications if needed. Stay off the drugs it will only hinder your ability to work through your baggage. 

I'm happy you have someone to talk to, but you're right they're not a professional so all they can really do is listen. Which is helpful because we all need someone to help carry our burdens, fears, pain, and our WANTS that we feel are out of our reach. 

You can do it and you've been working really hard, too hard. Take smaller steps, remove the substances that are not prescribed. Take the ones that are correctly. 

If you slip up ok. DON'T stay down and beat yourself up. Don't give up. Pick yourself back up and keep on trying. If you don't try then nothing will change. 

You ARE safe with a therapist. Even if you say you want to die and you've self harmed before and your abusing substances. I think what you fail to see is you're in SURVIVAL MODE!!! 

You're doing everything you can to stay ALIVE because death really isn't that appealing. What's appealing is feeling happy, strong, accomplished, having the ability to help other's, seeing your future, your home, your family, and feeling the pride in yourself for NOT giving up. 

That's some powerful shit right there. 

Reach for the positive, speak and only send out the positive. That's what WILL come back. If you continue to hold onto the negative and the pain that's all you're going to receive. 

It's the way it works. You have to think what are you going to feed the beast? 

Negative gets negative
Love gets love
Positive brings the fruits of the Lord. 

Embrace the unknown, embrace your ability to turn this around."
SuicideWatch,f3fmusz,t3_dgoid2,1570899453.0,"I say who gives a shit. You are NOT living your life for anyone else but yourself and the Lord. PERIOD. Getting a job allows you to go and get out on your own. It doesn't mean you won't help your family. 

Don't be pressed under their thumb. Depending on how old you are you can get a job anywhere. Get your resume uploaded to a ton of job sites and Go to your interviews. 

SERIOUSLY, if you feel like a damn door mat stand up, dust yourself off, and go do YOU!! DON'T take NO for an answer. 

If you suffer from mental health issue's seek help. Heal from what hurts you, haunts you, drags you down. So you're that much stronger, happier, and grateful for your life. 

This is YOUR journey make the most of it and don't let ""guilt trips"" drive you back down to the floor where others can wipe their feet off on you."
death,f3ebcnt,t3_dgnv58,1570867066.0," love her as much as you can. It's in God's hands now and that's hard to accept when you genuinely care for her. 

May the Lord provide you relief."
death,f3dpfe0,t3_dgnv58,1570843252.0,"When you figure it out, please let me know...

The first one that i experienced was a shit show with feelings of failure, regret, anger, pain that has no words that can Express, and plain ol emptiness. 

The feeling one gets when you KNOW you could have done something different that could have potentially saved them. 

It's a burn that doesn't EVER heal. It's a straight up shit feeling. 

So if you find out share with me will you?"
SuicideWatch,f3c79v2,t3_dga19b,1570820629.0," Change your misery. Cause death isn't an option. Look within you. Don't deny your faults embrace them, learn from them, then grow from them. Healing begins when you take care of yourself and the pains you've been packing away in your bag of shit of ""I  don't want to deal with"" Whether it be scary, hurtful, sad, or down right angry. 

By the way anger is a cover up emotion to assist with the feeling of sadness. 

You got this. Seriously you do, now tell yourself THAT over and over again.

Self acceptance, self appreciation, self forgiveness, allows one to stop stalling and begin moving. 

You wanna chat, text, you want someone to share your burdens with? I'm far from perfect and struggle myself, but I would be delighted to discuss choices you have, resources available, or simply listen."
SuicideWatch,f3c61uk,t3_dghfef,1570820223.0," You won't do it. Wanna know how I know? Cause you're reaching out HERE to discuss it. Looking for someone ANYONE to remind you of what you already know. 

YOU got thing my friend. Don't give up. You've been fighting a freaking battle in the middle of a war zone. The only issue is you started to think you're the enemy. You're not!! Don't fight what you're feeling. Work through it. 

I'm HERE by chance and I responded to you to remind you that you're worth it. You have WORTH!!! You have business to take care of and while you feel alone, defeated, etc.... You're not. 

You're just beginning, so buckle up my friend. Make brighter, happier healthier choices even if they cause temporary pain. Once you get through that AND you will your growth will be immense. Your strength and knowledge much more solid. Your believe in your abilities that much more secure. You will find relief. 

Please don't throw yourself away as one would garbage. YOU ARE NOT GARBAGE!!!! You are beautiful or handsome, either way a pleasant glorious light for YOURSELF and many coming your way. Hold ON!! 

Sometimes the walk is difficult. The walk as in self love and acceptance, appreciation, flaws and all. We humans get stuck sometimes when we reach OUT for peace as opposed to reaching within. Find yourself. Take care of yourself as you would other's who are pained by their situation. 

You yourself have great ability to heal, stand up, move forward, rejoice in all that you want, believe (be careful with belief, because sometimes ones mind tells them lies out of fear or doubt) and see. 

Seeing is believing, believing is SEEING. 

I'm not here to blow sunshine up your ass during a difficult time. I'm here because I was meant to be. There is not such thing as a coincidence. 

I'm with you my friend. Ten fold. Battle together, but not against ones self. Shoulder to shoulder. Stand strong, stand tall, and remember this is as temporary as you allow it to be. 

Message me. My name's Jamie."
SuicideWatch,f3c3h9q,t3_dgilys,1570819340.0,"It boils down to whether or not you're going to do something about it? Do you have the desire and strength to rise up above the low level frequencies that drain you of all your worth? 

YOU have a choice, actually you have several. 
Get up and change your behaviors that are not serving you. 

Stay where you are and suffer until your body gives out. 

Kill yourself and pray to your LORD almighty that you'll be forgiven for throwing away your gifts. 

Or

Kill yourself and be nothing, but a rotting corpse  in the earth of which you came having the maggots and all other nasty crawling creatures eat away at your flesh. 

May I suggest, you please stop ""listening"" or ""thinking"" the worst of yourself and your situation. Stand up, start small, it's about loving yourself in order to release the gifts that are within you. You ARE made for a greater purpose whether or not you want to believe it. 

I can relate, life is fucking shit sometimes and it remains shit when you don't take back control of what YOU do have control over and leave the rest to God. 

Seriously you are loved, this situation is NOT permanent. It will last as long as you allow it to. I'm not saying the pain, regret, fear, filth, doubt, etc. Will roll away over night, cuz you didn't fall into this hole or depths of despair over night. It happened slowly and perhaps in the beginning you felt it was good and now you're throwing dirt on yourself. 

It takes time and FAITH. The thought process of knowing you have greatness within you and honestly you're the only one who can make the changes needed. Again, it's a slow process. Don't bit off more than you can chew, cuz you'll choke  (Like the VikingsðŸ˜†).

Love yourself, truly believe, SEE something better and be detailed about it. It Will come to you and this time will be a thing of the past. One that made you stronger and more able to help dig other's out of the vicious cycle of negativity. 

If you suffer from ""mental health"" is try a medication to help you adjust. Get a therapist (it may take awhile to find one that works right for you; understands your views and is willing to step outside of the box to help you heal. 

Life isn't always cold, cloudy, gloomy, and full of pain, self doubt, evil/hurtful individuals. The sun does shine, even when it's cloudy because one must remember that above the clouds there is nothing, but beauty. If you've ever been in an airplane you would see that below is the storm and where YOU fly is in the light. 

If you wanna talk message me. We all fall down and sometimes we need a hand to help one stand up. 

God Bless and I'm sending you much needed LOVE, hugs, and belief."
death,f2yv696,t3_deqxyy,1570499188.0,"NO one dies alone find solace in that. While you weren't  physical there you all were there in thought. 

Think about it or physical beings, our carriers are nothing more than that. When we die we have everyone. EVERYONE.

She knows your heart ache and loves you for your thoughts, feels bad about your uncomfortableness. 

She's happy, she's free, she's loved. Embrace her in your thoughts, help your mom come to terms with it. She's happy. No more pain, no more suffering, she has life. 

May you find the light that shines upon you, may you feel her presence when she is around you, and may you feel at peace, released from the chains of guilt. She doesn't want you feeling bad she wants you to rejoice in her life she lived here and the life she is living now. 

May the Lord comfort you and may God relieve you from your sadness."
SuicideWatch,f2ytiiu,t3_dem5tu,1570498081.0,"Hey!!! You're loved!!! Period. You have purpose even if you don't see it
You're on suicide watch because our Lord straight up said.... NOPE!!! NOT leaving. Not your time.
Yea suck it up, but no guilt trip here. It's about finding yourself, seeing your gifts, your abilities, and trusting on your light that there IS benefit for your life, your living!!!

Try different meds ones that don't have the same side affects and WHILE on your meds please feed yourself, exercise, try not to abuse yourself by controlling what you ""feel"" you have control over.  Binging and purging.

Find a different therapist sometimes it take YEARS to find one you can connect with, God willing you don't have to wait so long. Find a trauma therapist, stick with your psychiatrist, see an internal med doc, try some cognitive behavioral health sessions, or eating disorder groups, or self help groups. 

READ. Read other's stories and struggles and how they over came them. Pick it apart, choose what servers you, let go of what doesn't. 

The ""guilt""trip is nothing more than individuals who have no other resources available to them. They're digging at the bottom of the barrel because that what was ingrained in them growing up. Some people run on pain and turn things around other's they simply barrel diem the freaking worm hole of abuse. 

If you get anything out of my response get this, 

YOU are worthy of a happy life, you deserve to be free of the pains that still haunt you, you deserve to let go.... let go of what does NOT serve you. You deserve to see and feel the beauty of life and the GIFT it truly is. 

Please rethink your plans. Rethink who's controlling you. You ARE NOT a puppet so cut the strings that hold you and torment you. Walk free flick the dust off your shoulder, pull yourself up by your boot straps, remind yourself YOU GOT THIS, you were NOT an accident. 

You are purposely made with great strength, deep love, understanding, and the ability to pull out of the trenches, because you SEE... heal yourself first, while healing other's, main focus is you otherwise you're no good for anyone else. 

""Man up"" means morning more than,  SEE YOURSELF, your future. Your happiness basking in the glory of the light above. 

Don't make a snap decision, for a temporary situation. YOU and you alone have control on which path you take, how much you want to suffer, whether or not you stand still and put the ""record on skip"". There's no reasons to continue to abuse. Break free my friend. You obviously have the power to do so. So now use that energy for good not for destruction. 

The dark forces, energies, low level frequencies thrive off that bullshit. Tell them to fuck off and go get what YOU know you deserve. 

Here's a hint..... It's NOT suffering. Contact me anytime. I would love to go through this journey with you as a support. 

Remember not all give give all hence why it takes a village to raise a child, a teen  am adult, and the elderly. Stick together, shoulder to shoulder and remember everyone has a level I  which they are capable of when it comes to support, love, understanding, and compassion. It does not make them inadequate. It makes them what you need, because REMEMBER it takes a village. 

Please continue to seek your life, your understanding, healing, appreciation, acceptance, forgiveness, and most importantly the belief that you are created for more.

Misery was not ""really""in the agenda. 

What does NOT serve you, let go!!

Contact me anytime.

Yours truly an understanding soul"
death,f2ynoqm,t3_def2yg,1570494548.0," She needs therapy. Honestly. If she's given up on herself that's a serious thing. If she's living for others that means she still wants to live at least a little. 

She hasn't totally given up. Therapy is the way. Not just any therapy or just any therapist. Trauma therapy with the right therapist. Sometimes it takes a number of locations and a number of different providers, but if she REALLY wants it to end working on herself is the first place to start. 

Does she work? Has she found purpose? Helping others keeps individuals up, but only for a period of time especially if they're struggling with their own demons. 

First and foremost do NOT stay in a relationship because you feel she'll kill herself if you leave. Honestly if she did or does it's what was going to happen anyhow. Forcing yourself to stay in a dysfunctional relationship is damaging to yourself. Remember if you're not good then you're not good for anyone.

Try reading self help books to her. Remember what you read and repeat, repeat, repeat. The brain works, but sometimes it takes a LOT of reconditioning. If one has been self programmed or programmed by other's and now they're older it's difficult to change the thought process, hence why I say repeat, repeat, repeat. 

Love her as you would yourself. Seriously, separate yourself and see what she's dealing with and if she only tells you half (which I'm sure she is) just imagine her struggle. 

You're a strong ""soul"" hence why you're seeking advice. Now try to feed her brain the same words/experiences that you would yourself when you're feeling low. You've dug yourself out I'm sure of it. Typically pained individuals find and connect with other pained individuals. It's natural. We seek to connect and to heal. 

Or 

We seek to connect and destroy. 

It's obvious what side you're on. 

You have a good handle on this don't doubt yourself. Reinforce yourself and share that with your love."
