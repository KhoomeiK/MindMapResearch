SuicideWatch,fm8c8d3,t1_fm6sdd1,1585846742.0,"Or family or anyone. When they shed tears because you were considering suicide (for me lightly considering suicide is still a daily thing), then I'm like I gotta live and I can't break their hearts"
SuicideWatch,flxqsq7,t3_fruhkd,1585588072.0,"I don't, I don't have anyone to resent to, and that makes things even more painful for me. It's just me, my mental illness, and the poor circumstances surrounding me."
SuicideWatch,flvybfy,t3_fri6ru,1585535017.0,"Not at all. Depression is endemic in the field of medicine, and I know at least one person that has taken their life during their study. I remember during my psychiatry placement, we weren't allowed into one of the wards as it contained a medical student that had attempted suicide (and access would thus breach confidentiality). 

I recently failed one of my final exams and the medical school is planning to de-register me. Since I have nothing else to live for and, I'm quite frankly tired of having a life consisting of nothing but dreams not coming true, I will likely commit suicide in the next few weeks. The real irony I guess is that as a medical student I have extensive knowledge of how to kill myself, and that this is the only way of saving my life."
SuicideWatch,flvw7gf,t3_fr7yor,1585533567.0,I'm up for a mass suicide; at least I'm not alone facing the fear of death.
SuicideWatch,flvtexk,t3_fredc0,1585531685.0,Same here. I think about all the permanent disabilities that can happen on survival. It's one of the only things holding me back.
SuicideWatch,flvolz3,t3_fqtx8q,1585528473.0,"This hits hard. This is exactly why I have so much regret, anger, resentment, despair and all the other emotions that have driven me to seriously contemplate suicide. Regret is probably the biggest part. I just hope that I can rest  in peace."
SuicideWatch,flvlgnr,t1_flvkg5p,1585526422.0,"Thanks for the words of encouragement; I appreciate the input, I'm glad too that you survived an attempt that you would have regretted.   


I was in my Final Year of Medical School and received my results on Friday that I have failed the written component of my exams. As this is a repeat attempt of Final Year, I am not allowed any more attempts. To negotiate a repeat required extensive review by my psychiatrist who, in his words, felt that I was ""unfit to sit exams or to judge one own mental health"" followed by a waiting period of one year. One of my conditions of this resit is that this will be a final attempt, and that none other will be permitted.   


I am 28 years old, I have no previous long-term employment history. I no longer have the medical degree that should have been achieved. I am left with nothing. I have a talk with the university tomorrow; but my academic prognosis is grim. In terms of earning income, I have nothing to stand on. Even if I were to have a job, I will spend the rest of my life regretting this, not to mention the caustic torment of inferiority complex. 

&#x200B;

For me, academic and professional success has been the pillar of my self-esteem and self-identity. I spent school days being lonely and bullied. Studying was the only one-uppance that I had, and is the only thing keeping me alive. 

&#x200B;

Now that I have lost this, and have no ground for hope, I am planning suicide, taking into account the adverse effects and the potential of any last minute changes."
SuicideWatch,flrjnnw,t1_flria4v,1585421577.0,"I don't hate it. However, I do hate they way they deal with student health and exams. There's no support. They expect you to act like it's fine. And I've sacrificed far too long of my life and being for this. And now I have nothing."
SuicideWatch,flrarlc,t1_flra50g,1585416446.0,"I haven't yet and that's a good point. The university offers an appeals process that students can use to alter an university decision (e.g. de-registration) in my case. However, for me, I've gone through the process before (I have repeated my final year) and the university explicitly stated that this will be the last attempt. I'll keep going, but the chances are grim."
