AJelqForYou,fqegfkl,t3_gi1utm,1589307136.0,"Not only what you said but also if you are young you still have a chance for your penis to grow so why potentially look into jelq when you never know, could still grow a bit.   After 18 look into it if you don’t get the size you want."
sex,fqefqtb,t1_fqcrkjp,1589306808.0,Thanks for your input. I believe that if it’s small to her it’s small to her regardless of her ex or what she currently thinks about you so my thought pattern is that a sleeve will help with that if I don’t have the size to please your current partner. If I have a 5 1/2 inch cock and that’s not enough for her saying it would be enough for her it’s just lying and I’d rather just have my partner be satisfied.  It’s not her fault that she likes me and I happened to not have a optimal cock size that she likes and it’s also not her fault that she likes a particular size.  I will say that if she absolutely can’t get over it even with a sleeve that it’s probably not the relationship she should be in.  It’s still disrespectful of her to say it that way though and she could have said it in a better manner.
sex,fqb609c,t1_fqb5l6v,1589231186.0,What about him sticking it in later on after he’s done with the sleeve?

AJelqForYou,fqay7td,t3_ghq3du,1589227329.0,While stretching although hard has been proven to be true by science but it seems like joking only has proof by places like this reddit.  Someone correct me if I’m wrong.
u_Theworksavage,fq9e1yj,t1_fphxpqe,1589195189.0,So small gains in EQ but only because I had to stop to really focusing on exams. Now that that’s over my next semester is already starting after a week Decon break and so I’ll be able to do this consistently for probably about three months or more depending on how school goes if it continues to go online.

AJelqForYou,fo0w9mv,t1_fo0jsff,1587420955.0,I definitely feel the stress your talking about.  If I’m getting bruised up and feel uncomfortable + only a small amount of pain should I hold off for a day or so?  I only ask bc I feel like I’m past the beginner stages a bit and don’t know if I should still abide by the 2 days on 1 day off formula.  The only thing I’ve really changed is I just started vacuum hanging.  I may be starting too strong at 5 ibs.
AJelqForYou,fo0jv8k,t1_fo0hpl2,1587414446.0,Lol the funny thing is I got banned but they asked me first!  What? So your just gonna hide this from members?
bigdickproblems,fnzyxmd,t1_fnzxaxb,1587403166.0,"Yes three hours a day it’s called PE (Penis enlargement programs). 
r/AJelqForYou is a community for it.  You can do it manually but I don’t do the manual (exercises where you stretch your Johnson with your hands like you mentioned) more then an hour a day typically.  I do the manual exercises and I stretch with device stretchers that actually lengthen your Johnson while you just sit around.  The reason why it’s not popular is because it’s hard and no one has patience to do it. It’s like having to work quadruple the amount to get as much results as you would see if you did just one hour of an workout with another body part.  I am 20 years old but I had a 5.3 inch erect penis in the past and although what I did was tedious what was more stressful was having a 5.3 inch penis.  So yeah I’ll take my exercises any day and I won’t stop until I’m at least 6.5.  I’m 5.9 now after about a year and a half.   I don’t recommend it as it can be risky and tedious."
MMA,fnzxdbp,t1_fnzx075,1587402387.0,I agree with you.  I have seen body type matter though at times in terms of power and like you said that seems to mostly be in the middleweight division
AJelqForYou,fnzwxo1,t1_fnzrnbw,1587402172.0,Oh I will but I just said every day because that’s what I’m going to strive to do when I feel like I don’t need any healing time.
AJelqForYou,fnzwh92,t1_fnztk57,1587401946.0,Hmmm I’ll have to look into that then.  If I could get close to your gains after a year of doing this I’ll be a happy camper.
MMA,fnzut23,t1_fnzt5lo,1587401130.0,"well you can’t just be big or look athletic you actually have to have some athletic ability Yoel Romero seems to be in that range of big enough to cause damage and athletic enough to be fast enough to hurt you. When you’re in this range you have a good advantage for power because it comes down to aim and speed rather than constantly having to worry about maintaining your form in the fight.  If you were to take a guy with 18 inch arms strong legs and a good core with moderate fighting ability and a person that is 150 pounds but has great fighting ability and experience, the athletic 18 inch arm guy with some fighting experience will prob still hit harder.  Doesn’t mean the big guys the better fighter but he certainly has an advantage in terms of knock out power on AVERAGE.  Ofc theres outliers.  Chances are if you know anyone with 17+ inch arms with moderate fighting condition and experience they punch pretty hard.  The big buff person from the gym with no fighting experience or conditioning probably still sissy punches."
bigdickproblems,fnztkd7,t1_fnzs00f,1587400513.0,"This^.  This explains the saying that girls who go black you never go back.  Girls who date hall tend to go for taller males in the future on average. Girls who like buff guys 10 day buff guys in the future on average.  Funny guys, tattoo guys.etc.  You get the point.  Whoever she dates in the past increases her likelihood of either dating them or not dating them again in the future based on how she perceives her experiences."
AJelqForYou,fnzrkem,t1_fnzorrm,1587399503.0,Yup you got the body type thing spot on.  I would say I’d like to be around 11-14% body fat. Anything under that like you said is just uncomfortable and I’ve been there before when I was a teen way before PE so I grew just from puberty and I can’t say how much Johnson was exposed then as compared to now.  It wouldn’t be a fair estimate to compare those teen years to now. I would say that even if I can expose a half an inch and be under 10% body fat I wouldn’t do it because it would just be too uncomfortable for me and it doesn’t feel healthy bc I am natural and don’t do any drugs.  Keep us updated though on the progress that you see with the gels and Anavar.
bigdickproblems,fnzqyxx,t1_fnzplya,1587399194.0,Well what I’m saying is let’s say you could have any size penis you want.  What size do you think you would be able to get all the way deep into a women?    I’m talking about for the average women you’ve been with.
AJelqForYou,fnzo6ty,t1_fnzn9j5,1587397762.0,Oh yes I’m aware it would just be exposing was already there. I’m 190 so maybe if I get to my goal of 175 I’ll expose a half an inch.
bigdickproblems,fnzno29,t1_fnzkhiz,1587397488.0,What would you theorized a good length in dick size is for the average woman that you’ve been with in the sense that you can get all the way deep? 6? 7?
MMA,fnzl0sg,t1_fnzjlgt,1587396093.0,"Honestly form is important but aim and  athletic ability will make the most difference in your striking efficiency when it comes to power in the long run.  I think as long as your punching accurately, fast and hard while protecting yourself, the specifics don’t matter as much.  By specifics I’m talking optimal footwork and optimal torque.  Once you have a certain amount of speed,strength, and accuracy the amount of footwork and torque doesn’t matter as much when you’re 170 and above.  It’s not hard to look at someone and tell that even if their form isn’t perfect that a punch won’t do a lot of damage anyways."

AJelqForYou,fnzdh3o,t1_fnuaw6y,1587391870.0,Okay I’m using a vacuum hanger though but I don’t think that should be much different.

AJelqForYou,fnxyq5k,t1_fnxp394,1587349286.0,Type of feedback I’m looking for!  How long have you been doing this bc nice gains!  Seems like you keep it pretty simple.
AJelqForYou,fnwl58y,t3_g46vot,1587320477.0,Hey I have similar problems at times does it come with this handle thing used to attached to the cap?  I use a vacuum hanger tho which I would recommend more.  You pull the handle and it sucks your johnson in to keep it more compact and steady.
AJelqForYou,fnuakj5,t3_g3tqvi,1587257960.0,Considering how little time 15 min.  That’s a lot of gains!  I think I’m going to pick this up.

Forgive yourself and just move forward that’s all you can do realize if anything else is just wasting your time and energy.  You have to believe it’s possible to do better.
GetStudying,fn7015m,t1_fn5i9a6,1586710661.0,Right and then you also have to have a little excitement.  I’m an D student to A student in math.  A tactic navy seals used that I used is “what if I could be that person that went from a D to an A?  How would that feel”?

When I say commit I mean really commit don’t just write it down, think about it and visualize what will happen if you get it done and what will happen if you don’t get it done on time/ don’t get the results you want.

It’s like procrastination takes a mind control over me right when I need to go to sleep.  Once I pull the trigger on sleep I sleep.  Are you saying listen to music or podcasts as a cue to go to sleep rather than fall asleep?  I’m talking about the act of disconnecting and and putting my head my head on the pillow.

Interesting you brought up the endorphins.  I’m aware of our ADHD brains having a lack of endorphins, the next thing I’ll research is if there is any way I can get more endorphins naturally?

That makes sense bc I’m not a full blown psychopath or anything like that bc I don’t exhibit all the traits just some prominent ones so the priority thing might be true.  I’m a highly ambitious individual but mentally I don’t always have top priorities 247 now that I think about it.  That’s where the ADD comes in.
AJelqForYou,fllty0v,t1_fllt8tf,1585267672.0,If I knew I would tell you bc I’m in a similar boat but smaller actually.  I would say just try the programs and routines for how you see fit and find out for yourself.  The most I ever got flaccid was just a little more veins but it’s really hard to notice girth gains in general especially if your not hard.  I doubt she would care if you got much bigger I’m sure she could get used to it and won’t mind it or even notice much difference.  Just as if your member was a little smaller.  It’s hard to get a drastic change in PE exercises.  That takes a long time.  So I would just try if I were you and see where it takes you.  Hopefully you get other answers and inputs tho.
