Recent research has also suggested that cerenia has an anti-inflammatory effect and since SPF is an auto-inflammatory condition in my mind it certainly isn’t going to hurt. 

Try to keep supplies at home so next time she has a fever you don’t have to drag them to the vet!"
sharpei,fm62hhq,t3_ft9quq,1585784894.0,"Veterinarian here 👩🏽‍⚕️and a self-proclaimed and educated Shar Pei enthusiast/expert. I can’t give medical advice on the interwebs but I can tell you what I do when my older girl gets a fever! I encourage anyone who has a Shar Pei to look into genetic testing as puppies so you know what to expect during their lifespan. I digress...

I keep the fan on her (she just wants to sleep on the couch and be left alone) which helps with the fever a little and I put a potty pad under her so if she doesn’t want to go outside I don’t have to make her. I’d also encourage you to speak with your veterinarian about some of the newer NSAIDs for canines on the market that aren’t as hard on the kidneys as carprofen. Dogs with Shar Pei fever need to take it easy on the kidneys/liver. Sometimes it’s needed though and this is very dependent on the case and your doctors exam/bloodwork, patient history, etc. 

I have her on a renal support diet that also helps with this (her kidney function tests we’re back to normal in 6 months). I also keep a handy supply of subcutaneous fluids at home which can minimize fever without relying on NSAIDs *so much* and also helps diurese the kidneys. 

Cholcicine has had limited anecdotal evidence of efficacy and comes with its own risks (and its expensive AF) so definitely talk to your doctor and see if they have an opinion on it for your pet. 

Good luck and really and truly hope your baby starts feeling better soon! SPF is the worst because it causes them to be so ouchy and sad feeling. On the bright side it’s usually over pretty quickly and hopefully yours is a short episode!!!  💜💜💜

Mine love EVERYONE and want to meet all the other doggos. But frequently other doggos don’t even give them a chance and can’t read their friendly cues correctly. 

I once had a pit bull latch onto my female at a dog park the moment we walked through the gate. I went bezerk on that dog trying to get it off of mine. Literally bit the dog as it’s biting my dog. Needless to say we socialize at home now with dogs we know are friendly.
