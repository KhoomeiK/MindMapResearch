They also probably don't sell too well at $120 a pop for individual games after ticket Master fees.

I don't know the number they sell but its probably a good deal for them to get someone in the stadium for 8 games at $312 who will probably buy more concessions and merchandise.

Interior was spotless and everything was better than you'd expect for a car that was 12 years old at the time. In 2+ years I've  had to put a new 12v battery in it and 4 new tires (I had 2 flat tires potentially from vandalism and it was cheaper to get 4 tires than 2).
