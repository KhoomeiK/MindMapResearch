Anxiety,fq7qlyu,t3_gh222b,1589150217.0,"Something I read that stuck with me was to focus on the non emotional parts of the cringe event. What were you wearing, what was the weather, what did you eat that day?  If you are like me, you don’t remember much beyond the cringe moment. Focusing on the negative emotion with laser focus is zoning in on one negative emotion from that entire day (or week or month). It was your negative emotion; nobody else is recalling your negative emotion the way you are. They really and truly don’t remember, anymore than you can tell me what you were wearing and what you ate that day. 

If I recall a cringe moment today I ask myself to remember these other details and it (1) makes me realize I can’t so how much does anyone else remember and (2) reminds me swiftly to just let that shit go and I’m being irrational for no good purpose. Forgive yourself and move on. Forgiving yourself is very freeing when you allow it into your life."

Anxiety,fpjndzt,t3_gden1f,1588674934.0,"The saying “if you can believe you can or you can’t you’re right” came to mind.  Almost every email I write has a glaring error or three or four. I’ve learned that I need to slowly re-read every email before I hit send. Even the ones that have 2 sentences.   I never multi-task when writing an email. I often chop my own writing because I ask myself is there a shorter way to have said the same thing? Nobody wants to read a long email.  I focus on: pleasant tone, keeping it brief, and re-reading everything before I hit send.  Nobody is analyzing your emails to the degree you think they are. 

The hardest thing for people with anxiety is keeping things in perspective.  How much would you care about a poorly written email if you were just told you have 2 weeks to live as an example?  It wound’t even be on your radar because you would have a healthy perspective of what was most important.  We have zero control over what someone else thinks about us, and yet we agonize and torture ourselves over this needlessly.  Worrying or over analyzing doesn’t help any situation and yet we do it constantly.  Try reminding yourself that this type of thinking is only making the issue larger than it needs to be, it is completely unnecessary, and nobody else is judging you the way you are judging yourself.

Every day we can choose to be accepting of ourselves or we can be overly harsh and critical. Our minds are so powerful that way. We need to learn how to recognize that we can overthink something to an unhealthy degree or we can let it go and shut down the hugely unhelpful inner critic. Stopping the negative thoughts when you notice them is the first step."

stopdrinking,fjv1cil,t1_fjudq7h,1583622273.0,"I was thinking the same thing.  Not IF I make it tonight, but WHEN I make it tonight. That one word change has s big impact on the mind."
AmItheAsshole,fj6efau,t1_fj69zbr,1583069201.0,"Thank you! I feel bad for this generation who seems utterly baffled as to how to deal with people using actual spoken words. You solve an issue through conversation, not by passively-aggressively typing about it to your friend and then writing about it on social media. I think YTA but you seriously don't seem to know better so it is hard to be mad about it."
stopdrinking,fd99g29,t1_fd7avfs,1578230261.0,"Another vote for ""tomorrow"" thinking.  We live in an instant gratification society that used to fuel so many of my ""screw it"" moments when I was feeling uncomfortable or fed up or had an urge to drink.   I want what I what when I want it. Consciously putting space between the I want to drink now thoughts was key. I am not an AA person at ALL, but I will not drink this minute, hour, day thinking got me through a lot. Distract and move on. The thoughts will subside."
Anxiety,fc6xzjs,t3_egd1qj,1577492391.0,"I do this to a painful degree. Sometimes I let out an unwanted scream because I'm so emotional about it.  I've done many of what has been suggested. The ones that help me the most are apologizing/addressing it head on with the person I'm stressing over if it was a recent event.  I reconcile in my brain how I'm going to ""fix"" it so  I can stop ruminating. The act of coming up with a plan is enough to calm me greatly. It puts me back in control and I think the lack of control over past situations is where I start to spiral.  If the event was 100 years ago and my brain won't shut up, I tend to lean into horror/suspense/action movies - when my anxiety is redirected in a more normal way, it also tends to calm me (distraction is key when you can I think).

There sure seems to be a lot of who deal with crippling rumination."
stopdrinking,fc46uzi,t1_fc3w125,1577408211.0,What an awesome post this is all around and I couldn't agree more about the OP being super brave to come back and share. Recount the memories of a large life and not numbers! Excellent advice for us all.
stopdrinking,fc46hpu,t3_eg0hmc,1577407925.0,Thank you for sharing your experience and I'm sorry you went through it.  I sometimes tinker with the thought that I can possibly drink after 4+ years and stories like yours are what have kept me from actually following through. It sounds too good to be true (we can handle it now!) and it is. It could be 5 or 25 years and it is likely going to have the same outcome if we drink again. You took a 3-month detour - that is a small blip compared to the 5 years you had. Not drinking with you today.

Anxiety,f937cev,t3_e3by69,1575051736.0,"Can you try to remind yourself that his internal ugliness has absolutely nothing to do with you? I've got a difficult boss and I often think how sad it has to be to live in her own head every day. I try not to let other people's shit negatively impact me.  From a behavioral standpoint, I try to keep our conversations as short as possible and every once in awhile I throw her a compliment and that seems to make her less toxic for at least some period of time. A little psychology can go a long way with these types of personalities."
Anxiety,f9361wv,t3_e3i3j5,1575050800.0,"Don't do it. The more you go down that path for comfort, the more you go down that path. I understand your thought pattern - I haven't drank in over 4 years after over a decade of trying to stop. Try getting lost in a good movie - scary ones always worked well for me - it redirected my anxiety more appropriately. You want to get out of your head for a while, but you don't have to drink to do that."
