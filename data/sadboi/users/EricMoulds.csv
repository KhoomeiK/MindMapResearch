careerguidance,fp4ekis,t3_gb5xw3,1588297368.0,"Howdy, echoing those asking for more deets on your interests. some recent conversations on this very topic come to mind, such as: In conversation with a Digital Marketer, they suggested Google AdWords + Facebook Blueprint (something something) + Excel Pivot Tables as three useful skills to join their industry. And I bet you could find them free right now! On the other hand, a publishing professional recently told me a Copyediting course would be highly recommended if one was going to try to get in to publishing somehow, especially without a degree per se. If you're into Youth Work, I found four different certifications from a thing called YouthRex in Toronto, and those are also free online. I suspect there are lots of free or cheap certs out there, or even fancy paid ones, but narrowing it down might be required..."

askpsychology,fofgowe,t3_g6qqz6,1587735496.0,"In all seriousness, your concern is valid. While I do strongly believe we do have 'power over' our mind, there are real limits and obstacles there. What does CBT, DBT, meditation, or gratitude practices do in terms of power over one's mind? What are their limits? What about prayer, music, or reflexive philosophy? There ARE powers we have over our mind, but what does that mean, how well has that been studied, and where are the limitations? There is, imo, truth to this idea that doesn't need to be victim blaming...but using this notion like it's the only truth certainly has that VB potential."

myfriendwantstoknow,fodfokd,t3_g6w09g,1587684104.0,"In response to an earlier statement of 'Read read read'...

I mostly agree, but wanna pipe up for those who don't read well, or dont learn by reading. I would suggest ""Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn."" Figure out how to absorb information and have at 'er. Listen to the podcasts, documentaries, and the news; find academic or trained experts and listen to them (audit courses at local post secondary if possible); witness demonstrations of new people, skills, sounds, and feelings as much as you can; determine how to assess an argument or presentation and be ready to do it, to those you're learning from, but especially to yourself (so you minimize picking up junk beliefs; be humble and curious); figure out how you learn and do it constantly. I too love books, but I encounter a lot of ppl left behind because that method of learning fails them. It's a shame, but it's true. And a lot of education is built book/reading centred (public, post secondary, online, book!), which is also a shame, potentially, if alternatives aren't an option. Long and Short, figure out how to learn, and do it all. The. Time."
