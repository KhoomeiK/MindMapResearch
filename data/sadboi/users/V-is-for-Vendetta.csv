Dogfree,fm8umrw,t1_fm8s1x6,1585856334.0,"And whenever we have a party most kids and adults **try** (our cats arn't *very social*, like most cats) stop and pet pur cat if there is one around at the start. Some of them either ignore the cat (and we are not offended) or just don't try because they know the cat probably won't allow them to. No, they don't bite or scratch so that they won't be petted, they just curve their spine down to the ground so that the hand just misses their fur and they are not petted this way. Our cats are also pretty chill around small children so if a baby like pets them the wrong way or grabs their fur their ears just turn backwards and the just lay/sit there until it's over. Usually the parent takes their child away by that time. But they never bit or scratched the baby, probably because they understood that *it's a baby* and the baby is not as experienced in petting cats or they just are chill with it."
Dogfree,fm8s1x6,t1_fm7n16z,1585854956.0,"We have 2 cats, and we never had a problem with people being alergic or disliking them. Plus whenever we have people over our cats just disappear while the guest are here. Sometimes they hang out at the start but still eventually go outside(they are both outdoor and inside cats) and do whatever they do outside. And why we never had a problem with people disliking them or not wanting them there: all of my mom or dad's friends either like cats or are neutral with them, and none of them have dogs. And most of the close friends(ones that often come over to our house and we go to theirs) have a babies and they know dogs are a bad idea if you have a child (ex. What if they have an allergy(the baby) or what if the dog bites?) so none of the have dogs. Other friends that don't have children don't have dogs either. Some of them considered getting a dog, but never did. And one of them, has both children and cats, so they are probably never getting a dog(too much work and also dog is dangerous). So that's a relief. 
Oh, and no, the ones with cats DO NOT bring their cat over to our house because they are polite (unlike some dog owners). I feel sorry for you that you and your husband had/have to go through this. The stupidity and nerve of your MIL."
