BPD,fomjbdl,t3_g856o2,1587892155.0,"Yeah I have this too! Especially when splitting, can't remember a thing most of the time. It really sucks... Sometimes when I feel really bad I seem to forget things too. I came back from my daily walk earlier this week, on wednesday I think, and my mom asked me where I had walked, but I couldn't remember the first half of my walk. And sometimes I can't remember things from when I was little other than what people told me or what I have seen on videotape. Except for the moments that had an enormous emotional impact on me, I remember those very vividly."

In my therapy we first found out what schemas I had the highest scores on (I can't really remember I think failure abandonment and dependence or something). But my therapist explained them to me and then she mentioned it sometimes but not too much. She focused more on the schema modes (the different kids, the protector and the parents). I don't know if this helps you or if I can help you get some more information but I like to think that because I succesfully completed the whole therapy and my BPD seems to be in remission now I know something about it lol. You can always comment on this or start a chat with me :)"

BPDsupport,fk18fp3,t3_ffntn9,1583774520.0,"Hiya, I hope I can help! I have had therapy and my therapist recommended a book to me (sadly, it's in Dutch and I'm not aware of any translations). It has helped me a lot and there's a part about a care package you can make for when you feel like shit. They call it ""a rescue box"". I'll just type what they said in the book because I don't really know how much you need from it, so here goes.

""When you feel lonely, sad, or inferior, it's often hard to think back to nice/fun things that have happened that will make you feel better. In times like those, it can come in handy to have a rescue box close to you. What you need, is just a box, a shoe box for example, that you can decorate to your own taste. You can fill the box with things that comfort you, or give you a more positive feeling. If you feel bad, you can take the box and use it to try to make yourself feel better. You can put anything in the box that cheers you up or comforts you, but here are some examples: a CD with music that you like (but preferably happier music), pictures of people who are important to you, a soft stuffed animal or blanket, your favorite tea, a card with ideas for fun activities (a walk for example), the phone number of your best friend, little souvenirs of your last holiday or nice/fun events.""

I really hope this helps a little, I haven't made one myself yet because I have not yet found a box or any decoration that I'd like to put on the box. I think that I would include: a stuffed animal from when I was a kid, something that refers to League of Legends because I love that game, that book, some cherry tea, a nice soft blanket to sit under, some of my wristbands from festivals, loads of pictures of dogs, some jewellery that means something to me, and probably more things as I'm doing it but I can't think of those now!

Edit: I spelled like shit, so fixed that"

Now I‚Äôm back to the loneliness, depression and what not really. I wish Incouls tell you waht to so, butt he truth is I got no fucking idea. I went back to therapy, my therapist told me to just not give up on the daily stuff like working or studying, and try to distract yourself as much as you can. And also, try to really focus on the good voice in your head. It‚Äôs really the hardest thing to do, but deep down you know what‚Äôs good for you.
