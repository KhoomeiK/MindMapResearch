If you can't believe in yourself don't, believe in the me that believes in you. Kamina from Gurren Lagann would say something like this to Simon. He never had any confidence and thought he was worthless without his big bro.

I'm not as sure why, but you don't see your worth and I can't say I'm a stranger to the sentiment.
Probably nothing I say will be new or powerful enough to move you from that edge, and that adds to my own hopeless and powerless. That's something everyone whose on here for you, and you yourself can relate to. You now what it's like to try and help others while feeling like no one can help you even when they are trying to. Sometimes life can be too cruel.

People can be even crueler, but we can be even kinder too. You know this. Some of us have so much love to give. So much love. You do too. You Know this. You apologized to everyone close to you. I thought I was the only one who did stuff like that. I'm 23 and if I slam my car too hard I apologise because it's wrong and I feel bad, maybe it's more for me than my car, but so what. Sometimes I look at my baby pictures and lament that he'd be disappointed with who we became. Sometimes there just so much sadness. You Know this.

Do what you think is best, but realize that you also don't know what's best. None of us do really.
So what do you do with that. For one don't add to your loneliness with excuses. How close are you to your brother talk to him, God i'd need my sister to do that with me. I know how it feels to not want to burden others and how selfish it is to take away from their happiness in the moment, but if you love each other it doesn't matter because you'll be happy together for tomorrow. How would like it if it was someone you loved? I don't ask this for guilt Lord knows I'm still asking myself everything I'm asking you. I know you already feel guilt, but why should you. Don't take yourself away with hatred for yourself in your soul. Life is already too cruel for that.

If you can't live for you at first do it for those that love you most. Kazumi, Nagisa, Sayaka, Yowane, Kyoko, Yang, Nikki, Ren, Tsurono, Mami, Blake, Madoka, Weiss, Ruby, Homura, Emma, Rena, Gumi, Alina, Sakura, Felicia, Yachiyo, Luka, Rin, Iroha, Sana, Kanade, Mitama, Rika dad, mom, bro, Miku, Binxy. When you look or think about them it will be with tears. Now they'll be saying sorry too. I for one am tired of the sadness, smile. Then cry and smile again. For Everytime you cry smile. You don't get to just share your happiness with everyone. They need to see your sadness too it's apart of you isn't it. 

You're more than what you lack. Come on DarkVixen smile again.

Don't forget to come back and show us either! We'll be waiting, thank you."

google,f58e1ec,t3_dmzpps,1572054281.0,"It regards to os updates on paper the iPhone last longer. I believe the longest was maybe the 5s or 6 for either 5- or 6 years. Pixels are guaranteed at least 3. This is the 1st Pixel’s 3rd year it released with android 7 and now has 10. Next year we’ll see its longevity . However with more powerful SOCs and ram, I wouldn’t be surprised if both brand devices are extended in terms of os support. They should definitely last 3 years, but on paper an iPhone seems to have the history to back up its support."

google,f4yi7ab,t1_f4ygf7u,1571877057.0,"It’s my assumption, but I don’t believe most people buy a phone solely to see if they’ll like it. I’m sorry if that’s the impression I showcased.
They most likely buy it because it’s something they want to use, and whether it’s $100 or $2000  if it sucks they’ll return it. I think this goes for every phone. My point was to not wholeheartedly and readily imbibe the “truths” that people have already decided for themselves. If “truth” is important enough we should decide for ourselves  what that means. I seen a couple post where people have the new Pixel and return it and others where they enjoy it and are glad to have not listened to others. I just don’t know think other people should decide what’s best for others, give advice sure, but there can be a thin line I personally try not to cross. If you read this far sorry for the long read."
