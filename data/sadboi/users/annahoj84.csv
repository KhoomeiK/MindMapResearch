Being on probation and pushing through a couple more months anyway seems like a good opportunity to maybe think it through before doing anything drastic - and if you are gonna throw it away anyway maybe there is another way to recklessly persue happiness? Like you know that what you're going through sucks, but you know that being strung out sucks too (and relapse is very dangerous after being clean for a while), so maybe consider some new options that at least have the potential to not ruin your life? Like go to college (if youre gonna kill yourself or end up in prison, whats some debt to worry about?) Or move to some off the grid organic farm community to get away from it all (if you're gonna be broke and burn all your bridges anyway might as well find out if youd enjoy the small community and connection to nature and healthy lifestyle). Obviously you can go back to using any time but there are so many other ways to live, why go right back to using? And if you really just NEED a headchange why go back to opiates? Have you tried cannabis these days? A little dab will do ya and it wont kill ya (and on the west coast its not even gonna get you in trouble! You could even work in the industry!) 

You have 2 years clean right now but you have not had a chance to enjoy your freedom yet - constantly jumping through hoops and not able to determine how you spend your energy being broke all the time paying court costs and all that shit. Likely living in clean and sober houses and going to outpatient programs and having other people treating you like a fuckup all the time... Its natural to be stressed, feeling isolated/ disconnected/ worthless/ unstable - you are getting your shit together and right now that means you got a bunch of shit to deal with and its fucking exhausting and the system is not built for your success - but you are so close to being able to enjoy your sobriety and freedom and being able to build the new life that can bring you happiness. You know doing a shot will only give you temporary relief, and its totally natural to want that relief, but I hope you will hold out a bit longer and give yourself a chance to overcome your current struggle instead of being overcome by it.

It's really important to consider that this is happening at work so you gotta really consider the professional look of what you do. Personally, I would try to avoid dropping to her level because that's the kind of reaction she wants. It also changes the dynamic from her clearly being rude to you to general drama if you start calling her the wrong name and being generally passive aggressive or difficult to work with. Taking the high road makes you look way better to your co-workers and boss. 

Most workplaces expect employees to utilize a chain of command for conflict resolution - start with a private respectful direct conversation (with a very clear request) then let your boss know that you had the conversation and that they are continuing the behavior and ask for their support.

If you try something and it doesn't work out that's ok, just keep trying things until you find your balance. And know that as you grow, what you need will likely change and that's okay too. 

My doctor told me that the big things that support long term sobriety are: focusing on making new healthy friendships/interests/ goals and also letting go of everyone and everything that is hurting us; having someone we can be real with, having some system of accountability with someone to help us be open and honest about how we are doing; having someone who will be real with us, recieving counseing or other support to help with processing all the stress; honestly wanting to change and having hope that things can get better if we do the right things.

I have definitely had my share of shitty birthdays (since you asked)

When I was 19 my birthday was the day I realized that I had been completely isolated by my abusive bf and that my stupid love for him had pushed everyone else away and that he didn't even care about me. At the time I believed no one cared about me (my parents had said if I dated him I couldn't live at home and that resulted in me moving out right before I turned 18 then he gradually convinced me everyone including our mutual friends barely tolerated me and that I needed him to survive because we were homeless and I had no street skills). I remember being with him at someones apartment, there was no furniture, no food, he was passed out most of the day and I was stuck there because I felt I had no where to go. So I just sat alone for hours crying and trying not to bother him because I knew he would be mean if I woke him up. The girl who was letting us crash there came home eventually and she made me a cake with a jello cheesecake box kit and she put incense on top like a candle. If i remember right it was a cute idea but the milk was bad so we didnt eat it. She didnt even know my name and we had not talked during the few days we had stayed with her because my boyfriend had convinced me to not talk because people might get mad at me or kick us out. 

When I was 20-23 birthdays were a big drunk party with people who were in my life for the shared party for the most part and there is nothing really special about the whole bar singing happy birthday. I got so wrapped up with all of my ""friends"" that I neglected self care and caused distance between myself and the people who really cared. There was always drama.

By my mid twenties my idea of a nice birthday was to hear from my best friend who lived out of state but who consistently called me to say happy birthday (someone who I met when we were like 14 and who helped me get away from the bad boyfriend), and to have dinner with my family, and generally just nothing bad happen.

On my 27th I started the day kinda bummed because I was house-sitting for my parents instead of able to be with them, but it was ok because I was starting a job that day! So I was trying to focus on the positive and make the most of it. I took a shower to get ready for work, then I slipped on stairs and landed on my foot - it hurt bad and was instantly swelling - and for some reason the first thought that came to mind as I sat on the ground dripping wet half wrapped in a towel  wondering if I broke it was ""I am not going to hear from my best friend ever again (because he had died a 6 months ago), I can't go to work with a broken foot, I can't even get to the doctor, and I cant even take pain meds even if I went to a doctor. Fuck birthdays."" I felt so alone and so hopeless on top of the physical pain... No one had contacted me all day not even on facebook, not even my parents - and tons of people knew it was my birthday because they all asked me later that week what I did for my birthday and they assumed I hurt my foot doing something fun.

Thats just a couple of them. I actually kinda avoid acknowledging my birthday at this point - if other people do that's cool but I insist on going with the flow and not making plans. I find that the more expectations I have the more stupid shit happens the more letdowns happen, but if I just treat it like any other day then I can appreciate the perks as they come. Some people react to this and think its sad, depressing, or unhealthy but I have SO MUCH appreciation for all of the times throughout the years when people have helped me, reached out to me, done kind things to lift my spirits, got me token gifts because they were thinking about me, and generally been there when it really counted - so I don't feel like its a loss to treat my birthday like any other day."

CPTSD,exduk4e,t1_excc3k4,1566187177.0,"I totally went through that for years (most of the time just trying to tough it out not even believing I could get better) it was really rough. I finally found a great therapist and learned a lot of tools and developed a much better understanding of my behavior. Things that help me ""snap out of it"" and be productive : 

Routine really helps me I think because I can autopilot and still be productive. 

Not letting myself beat myself up is also really important - if I am mad at myself for not getting things done I remind myself that I am learning and growing and this is growing pains and that it would make more sense to focus on the moment - what can I do right now to work on that goal? 

Making my goal/ tracking my progress based on the new habits I wanted to build instead of what projects were completed - the whole to do list was way too much to consider- I just made myself start working on homework daily at 3 pm  and I became more productive. Some days I would get 15 min into it and freeze up with my pen in hand but other days I would be hyper focused for hours, and it got easier after a week or so and it balanced out because the hardest thing was getting started. 

Setting goals like ""I will get home, have a snack, and work on XYZ for 2 hours before I do anything else"" also putting the priority stuff literally on top of other things. If the book is on top of my phone I have to grab it first. 

I also found that taking vitamins (b's, magnisium, general multivitamin kinda things) helps me focus and have energy without the crash of sugar and caffine. 

Scheduling a ton of time for sleep really helped because I've always had nightterrors but was trying to get by on 5-7 hours which does not cut it when you are not getting any rest. 

Playing brainwave music instead of other music/ tv/ silence helps a bit  (Theta for focus Delta for sleep). 

I am currently doing neurofeedback and completely swear by it (if you are able to afford/ access a therapist who offers it). It trains the brain by using sounds and images to  default to a relaxed state. Sessions are relaxing and involve little wires attached to the head with glue stuff communicating with a computer program that plays music and/ or makes images and sometimes you just listen or other times interact with the images on the screen (just a bunch of bright colors). Best of all, it does not stir up the trauma. I wish I had been able to start it years ago!"

If they tried to bring up school I would say ""what about it? Am I doing so good that this is the best I can hope for? Is this as good as it gets?""

askwomenadvice,ex9vb1s,t1_ex95a6j,1566094894.0,"You should probably start with the kids parents, especially considering the kid who was diagnosed as BPD might have even told a therapist and the parents might be in denial (or you telling them might give the therapist the ability to ask the right questions). They absolutely need to know. And you can explain to them everything you did in this post and prepare them for the fact that it is a family secret. 

You might have more luck protecting the kids if you allow it to be a sorta secret - like make it a point to let people know who need to know in order to protect the kids but don't insist on everyone talking openly about it. If you demand that people open up they will get mad and likely deny it, but if you talk to those parents and say ""hey I just found out this family secret that you need to know about...my mom might deny it but will probably agree that it is best to not let him be alone with kids"" it will give them a way to confirm that they need to protect the kids without making everyone else be open about something they are conditioned to be quiet about. Really unless there is someone willing and able to come forward and go to court he is not likely to go to jail so the best outcome is to prevent any future opportunities for him to hurt kids and that does not require everyone being open and upfront (which is good because they seem set on hiding the truth) it just means keeping parents of kids/teens in the know."

The things you are struggling with are actually really common and just about any therapist will be able to help you improve your quality of life. It will also show your wife you are working on things which is a perk. I can not express enough how helpful therapy is for this kinda thing. 

You do not have to go in there and share your deep dark secrets and your life story, or find just the right person - just someone who practices/ teaches cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, mindfullness, and/or motivational interviewing (these are all really standard therapy tools that help us learn new tools to address our problems). Getting started in therapy is the hardest part, especially if you have trouble making decisions because it can feel like a huge decision but I promise it is not because if you dont like them you never have to see them again and it is normal to shop around a bit. If you go in and tell them that you want to become more confident and be more comfortable making decisions they should be able to help you start making little changes as soon as the first visit.

Sorry for the rant I can just relate so much to what you're going through with the self doubt and freezing up and everything..

askwomenadvice,ewqsgs2,t1_ewqpjvg,1565677080.0,"How they say it makes a huge difference, how supportive they are of their partners efforts and growth, if they are motivated by personal frustration or concern is important too.

If I was OPs wife I would be asking to go to couples counseling or diving into resources about communication and ways to help my partner overcome anxiety. OP clearly has very severe anxiety and it is good for the wife to want OP to work on it because left unchecked it can escalate and get worse and worse which is no good for anyone. Anxiety is not ""who you are"" even if it maybe a bit of who you are because it is something that you experience. 

Wanting your partner to take care of themselves and seek treatment for treatable conditions is good and it is reasonable to say ""I really need you to work on this"" when a loved one is not taking action sometimes they need to be clued in that there is a significant problem. They should then support the person in whatever they are doing to work on it and celebrate the small victories and be encouraging every step of the way. That does not mean that it is the wifes responsibility to become OPs therapist. OP needs professional help these symptoms go beyond a touch of general anxiety and are having negative affects on their life so its time to talk to a professional. 

Suddenly lashing out about it and being mean - intentionally hurtful - or expecting immediate change is bad. A loving partner will show compassion and not hold unrealistic expectations. 

Because OPs WIFE said that this is having a negative impact on the relationship I am assuming that she wants to help OP be more confident but does not expect OP to be a whole new person - just work on this issue so that they can go out on a date occassionally and make decisions as a team. Having to make all the decisions affects the power balance and makes it feel more like a parent child relationship and the wife wanting OP to work on it so that they can feel like equals is totally fair."

A huge part of the responsibility for childcare is that the provider will not stop providing care until the parent or other pre-designated  caregiver is there to take over - no matter what. Obviously the flip side of that is people may not agree to watch your kids if you tend to flake off or have a bunch of emergencies (especially if you don't check in, are not apologetic and don't compensate them for their time). To leave your kid with someone who wont stick around if you are late is a serious risk!

Also you might consider that most people would feel kinda akward in your situation and that its ok to feel kinda akward and less physically intimate right now and that that is ok because you guys are working on it and it is logical for his drive to be low under stress and that the stress is not permanent. If the cause of the stress is likely to be long term like more than a couple months then you guys should be actively working on learning new coping mechanisms and self-care to reduce the stress so that you can both enjoy life more and not end up in depression/ anxiety due to prolonged stress.  Getting out in nature together and trying new activities can really help a lot. It might also really help to take some time for yourself - a nice ""bubble bath"" self care routine could help you stay comfortable in your skin even if he is not involved... Maybe leave the door open for a mix of openness without feeling weird like you are doing something weird by being naked when he is not into it."
florida,ewlok0t,t1_ewllfa5,1565531582.0,"Nobody is saying that people should vote without any ID, although there is a reasonable argument that the only thing people should need is their voter registration card. 

The issue is when generally recognized forms of ID (such as a tribal ID or voter registration card or passport) are not accepted because they require a State ID. It is  especially bad when that rule does not become publicly known until right before the election. It is voter supression not a rational unbiased procedure to suddenly say that you need a state ID. Especially since the communities affected are often rural getting a state ID can be a very time consuming process that requires transportation and time off work on top of the cost of the ID so it ends up being a barrier to voting. For those of us who live in urban or suburban areas its hard to comprehend living on a rural reservation an hour or two from the nearest city with a DMV/ Licensing office - and if that Tribal ID is good enough for everything else why should they have to get another ID?"

It is stupid to bring little kids to dog parks and just let them run around because it is an accident waiting to happen. People who bring kids are often the same people who bring in food or other objects that most dog parks advise against having in the park because again it is just an accident waiting to happen.

LateStageCapitalism,ewl980b,t1_ewhpaet,1565512108.0,"Minimum wage does not equal living wage, I am living on more than minimum wage in FL and can't rent the cheapest apartments because I dont make 3 times the rent. My situation is very common in the USA and I am guessing Mexico is similar. These workers would not be risking their livelihood if they were not in a bad position. It is very likely they are living in company camps or having to live ""doubled up"" with multiple families or lots of extended family all in one house. 

Their situation is not even remotely comparable to people making $15 per hour in an expensive city. In the SF Bay area people working for $15 per hour are likely living in shitty apartments in the less desirable areas, renting rooms shared with another person, and/or working a couple jobs. The big cities in the US have a lot of wealth that people can tap into through working in the service industry, they have loads of public resources, and tons of opportunity to network for more affordable housing, learning new skills, bartering/ trading, etc. These people are farmers so its a good chance that this company is the main employer in their area and they can't just work harder or smarter to get ahead (especially if they are not making a living wage). The whole community is in poverty because the company is taking advantage of the low minimum wage. 

These people work hard, they have to meet production standards that require focus, skill, and perseverance (while working in harsh conditions much of the time). The US depends on immigrant labor to fill agricultural jpbs because the work is so hard it is nearly impossible for them to convince most people to do it for any length of time. How many pounds of berries do you think they pick in a day? We are paying two dollars per pound usually more so shouldn't the workers be compensated? Would you not be willing to pay a little more to know that they could send their kids to school or have reasonable working conditions?

Personally for work I do a face care routine with really good moistuizer and sometimes a tiny bit of something to lighten up or add color to my cheekbones, then do my eyes with a simple liner, shadow and mascara. Usually I will wear lipgloss sometimes with color. This makes it look like ""I take care of myself"" enough for work but is still natural enough to look like me and also not too expensive. If there is a big event like a wedding or something where I expect lots of attention like if I am doing a presentation, I will do a bit more to look polished. 

I get the Allure Beauty Box so I only spend $15 per month and get to try a lot of nicer beauty products than I normally would and I have not bought any makeup since I got it because my skin looks better and they often send full size products.

They could be a good source of information about local resources - if there is an acute detox facility that does medication assisted detox I highly recommended it because they basically set you up to sleep through it and when you finally feel okay enough you go home when you want to. 

Considering that you are looking for work and have had a hard time staying clean, getting into an outpatient medication assisted program for at least a couple months might help you actually get your life together sooner and with more support.

There does not need to be malintent for something to be racist.

Plenty of white people in the USA have thick accents, or talk too fast, or will generally be shitty teachers and plenty of people in the USA have very foriegn names and are very articulate speakers.

OP demonstrated some clear racial prejudice and his friend is rightfully called him out on it and doesn't want to hear excuses.

Source - someone who speaks very clear English as my first language and has had lots of people with hearing aids tell me it is hard to understand me because of the tone of my voice, and taken a ton of classes with teachers who had foreign names but speak perfect English, and some native english speaking teachers that I had a hard time understanding because they were too fast, too quiet, or just plain disorganized in their lectures."

If you gotta punish yourself do it by working hard to change yourself. Stay in school just so you can reach out to the kids sitting alone at lunch. Give up your dream of being CEO or whatever and make your life work focused on helping others - I promise that living on a caretakers salary will be a daily struggle and allow you to make ammends to your sister for as long as you need to do it. Or open yourself up to judement and tell your story - work with programs that address bullying or suicide prevention and go tell audiences about how you messed up so that other people might be able to save their siblings or friends and you can make a difference. These things will take a lot more effort than ruining your life but they will be a lot more meaningful and I promise its never too late to throw it all away - but doing it right now will just be another selfish act. Your mother must be absolutely devastated, so the least you can do is give her some hope that at least you will be okay - wash up go to school hit the books like crazy and work your butt off to help your mom not you. 

Please take into consideration that if you had really understood what she was going through and felt like you could fix it, that you probably would have. Especially being a teenager with a tween sibling that is driving you crazy and family members who are not role modeling how to handle it better your behavior made sense with the information you had at the time.  Thinking your sis gets teased from time to time is different than knowing that she is being tormented on a daily basis, you did not know how much she needed you until it was too late - and that can happen to anyone ESPECIALLY someone in your shoes - there are others who were responsible for seeing the signs and getting involved who failed your sister and who hold more responsibility than you do (mostly the adults at her school). It is really normal to feel the way you do in your situation and you might feel really strongly that it should have been you, but it wasn't and for the sake of your mom (and everyone who cares about you) you need to get some perspective and figure out how you are going to move on. 

You might not want therapy or support because you feel like you deserve the worst but the people around you deserve better than that so go for them, go to find out how to show up for other people, to learn how to care about other people, to learn how to do things you dont want to do just because its the right thing to do. I promise theres nothing they can tell you that will make you feel better, this will always weigh on your heart but they can help you find ways to make ammends and how to stop being the kinda person who doesnt realize what he has until its gone."

Daughter obviously, mom is enabler and OP for giving up on his kid and having an all or nothing reaction. 

I really hope OP reads this !!!  

There is a middle ground where you support her by letting her live at home and go to therapy and take community college before sending her out into the world. She needs to learn to connect her actions with rewards and consequences beyond what you impose - like saving her money to be able to take tests at the end of the year, and people being really upset and hurt and not trusting her if she steals. You (and your wife) need to learn how to be a much more involved parent because time is running out to have much influence and your kid REALLY needs you. 

She is 17 and bad with money and honesty it sounds like she needs to start putting all her money through the Parent Bank System, for her own good!  You monitor every purchase and every deposit and if she is not being responsible take away her debit card for a week and make her ask to use it on a case by case basis - no cash. Seeing the savings add up on those weeks might even help her realize that saving up is worth it. It might help her to see how much impulse spening she is doing. You will have the chance to help her develop some wisdom before she turns 18 and maxes out credit cards because she never learned self discipline or consequences. Talk to her about credit. Notice the kinds of things she buys (and if she comes home with things she didn't buy) and talk to her about priorities and value. She is working and has no expenses - she can pay for her classes and tests and applications to show you that she is committed to her future and not just enjoying the free ride you are giving her. 

If she resists that kind of system you could also just let her be a ""roommate"" and come up with an agreement that she pays for all her own stuff - clothes, test fees, rent, food and using the car (if that seems too mean just put all the money she gives you into a savings account for her to use when she is on her own). 

She is not a ""lost cause"" unless you give up on her or just keep doing the same thing and expecting different results. It would be very unwise to invest in her future when she likely to sabatoge herself. The chances that she is not also stealing from others is very slim to none and it is only a matter of time until she ends up in court if this behavior continues.

It is very important that she understands that if you had pressed charges on her, if the bank had flagged the checks as fraud, that she would have NONE of the things she takes for granted. If your bank had noticed the checks were fraud they could have investigated and it could have been a real mess. If she got caught by ANYONE else she would be in jail for check fraud that is a FELONY. 

Did you know that this kind of behavior could be associated with Human Trafficking? She could have a ""friend"" who is grooming her and encourages this kind of behavior - she could be buying things for them or they could be hoping you will withdraw support so that they can ""save the day"" and take her in - isolate her from you one way or another and put her in a position to have to ""pay them back"" by doing horrible things.. She could already be ""modeling"" or something like that and it would be hard to know unless you are really involved in her life. Remember she is still young and vulnerable to these kinds of people, please don't kick her out on the street because she will be a target. If you suspect this please talk to a professional before you talk to her because it would be dangerous to push her away/ towards them. 

Unfortunately it is a pattern behavior and you guys didn't take it seriously enough when it started so its going to be a long road to recovery for the whole family. You all need therapy, not just her. By going as a family you also send her the message that you recognize that she needs help and that you want to be a part of the process. If you just send her it makes it like a punishment or just a condition for your $upport.

Also, something people don't talk about a lot is that the first time having sex with someone is usually a bit akward no matter what, so don't get in your head about it just enjoy the moment and focus on making them feel good and things will work out!"

Ok...it's been 36 hours this is the worst of it and you already toughed it out this long - you can do another 36 you got this!"" Once the acute detox was past that week was a blur and I thought of it like ""yeah I just kicked dope last week not trying to go through that again"" 

I think it is weird to put a lot of weight on clean time because there is so much more to recovery from substance use disorder than the last day we used a particular substance - like lets celebrate rebuilding the bridges we burned and achieving the goals we never even had when we were using and appreciate every day as a blessing."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,euc0095,t1_euaz4pa,1563661344.0,Do not underestimate the value of being a dependable worker with a good attitude. Showing up every day wanting to work hard and get along with other people will make you stand out in a good way and set you up for success. It is much easier to train someone with a good attitude to do a new task than to train someone who knows the task to have a good attitude.

OpiatesRecovery,eu4592i,t3_cel0m0,1563439092.0,Highly recommend intentionally replacing it with some healthy habits - like eating lots of fresh fruits - otherwise your brain will seek out quick fix feel goods like sugar and caffine that will make you crash and feel worse. You may also benifit from talking to a counselor (especially during the first 6 months) just to have them remind you about how your brain works - that it's normal to feel kinda crazy - and suggest new ways to manage stress.
OpiatesRecovery,eu44sx6,t1_eu28igv,1563438432.0,"When I cut down to tiny doses and then spread them out (started at 8 mg but tapered over a couple momths down to bigger pieces like .25 every other day then every 3 or 4 days then quit) the only withdrawl symptoms I had were lack of energy for the last couple weeks and mood swings - I forget if I had the sniffles or a stomach ache if I did it was not too bad - the thing that really helpped at that point was getting out of the house, socializing and moving around a bit. I was also probably smoking a lot of herb too."
OpiatesRecovery,eu43qlm,t1_eu43ibn,1563436891.0,"Also many doctors keep people on it for years because they can get their lives back to normal and we don't begrudge people any other kind of daily medicine that people effectively are addictex to and need in order to function (like SSRIs). If people completely change their lives - get away from seeking the escape of the high, stop associating with people who use street drugs and doctor shop, and get good jobs and their families back hen they have a much better chance to stay sober no matter how hard it is to get there."

askwomenadvice,eu435wc,t3_cedtcx,1563436083.0,"Nobody seemed to mention a very important fact - the first couple years is often very unpredictable! She is very likely to have spotting between periods, be late, be early, have a shorter or longer than ""normal"" period and it is normal. Having panty-liners available to use daily can reduce the ""OMG what if I have an accident"" anxiety. 

Also, please be prepared to allow her to stay home from school once in a while when her cramps really are THAT bad, and if it is regularly really bad going to the gyno for birth control might help. It really does feel like there are kinves cutting out your insides and ibuprofin barely helps and the blood loss also causes fatigue and chills on top of nausea from the cramps/ hormones and knowing that you will probably have a leak during class, and be expected to focus in classes all day and probably do PE too is just TOO much some days. Of course teens eventually need to learn to grin and bare it, but not all the time because even adult women sometimes need to leave work early due to migraines, etc and teens have it even harder than grown ups a lot of the time.  Please do not assume she is being over dramatic if she has days she is in tears and can't get out of bed - remember that as frustrating as it is for you it is even harder for her. 

Another thing to consider as she gets older are the other (non-parent) adults in her life. Encouraging her to bond with a supportive woman who you trust -like an aunt, a coach, etc. will give her someone to not only talk to about girl-things but see as a role model and mentor for other things down the line. If the women she feels close to practice good self care (and bodily acceptance) she is more likely to pick up those habits than from you talking about it or watching youtube videos."

Personally I could not taper off of my drug of choice and a huge motivator for me to get clean is getting out of The Game and not having to worry about the law or getting sick because I couldn't find anything. I had to change EVERYTHING - moved across the country and started a bup maintenance program. I started at 16 mg April 2018 and am currently at 4mg and my life is so different and it is amazing and I am still tapering and looking forward to being totally quit in a few months."
OpiatesRecovery,ettpaud,t3_cdg263,1563191274.0,"I have heard of that happening to other people, I believe it can heal but not if it does not get a chance to. Taking softeners might help a lot, drinking a ton of water should help too. 

If you have the option to do a medically assisted detox - with non opiod meds preferrably at a detox center - and it wont mess up the rest of your life to take the time off to do it, it is really worth considering so that you can get it over with and be in a position to really heal from all of this. Personally, I have done it both ways and I am glad I got on subs but this slow taper process sucks and I wish I could go to detox for a couple weeks and be done with it. In the past when I went to detox the problem was that I didn't have a plan for when I got out. The most important thing is to have a plan, and hopefully some kind of support system, and focus on consistently making positive changes."

If you want to be proactive and compassionate about it I would communicate to the dad -and management - that you want them to be able to live there but that things need to change. It sounds like dad is not very well informed or engaged in managing his kids behavior and if that does not change things are going to escalate during puberty especially if dad is teaching him that he can get away with bad behavior. There are organizations that can help this family and the kid can learn appropriate behavior, but it might take an ultimatum from the landlord for them to realize they need the help."
TwoXChromosomes,etpng04,t1_etoxslq,1563059991.0,You guys have been building your careers and are moving and talking about having kids - sounds like a lot of big changes that are positive but also probably stressful too. When exciting positive things cause stress we often do not recognize it as stress but it can affect us similarly. She may also be struggling with depression - which can be very hard to identify when everything on the outside seems to be going great. No matter the cause it could not hurt to take her on a date and bring her home and run a bath and put on her fav tunes - just help her relax and see what happens.
AmItheAsshole,etdy8fc,t3_cb10pv,1562718215.0,"Obviously NTA but you deserve to hear it here if you are not getting the support at home. 

Idea, since you probably have to deal with her and the family and cant really make her stop jumping to conclusions - invite family to participate in the recovery process (like AlAnon or SMART recovery family programs) and hope for the best. Remember they all have their own crazy and most people do not have the benefit of programs that teach them how to be better people... Acceptance is the answer :)"
AmItheAsshole,etbwhww,t3_cavukv,1562665398.0,"ESH - 

Obviously your bro sucks, stealing food is an antisocial habit that your parents ought to be doing more to address, especially since it sounds like there is no lack of food just lack of respect... Maybe suggest to your parents that your bro should have to pay for things he steals and make up for it by also doing something nice for the person? 

It is totally reasonable to be pissed at your bro and want some revenge and generally want the behavior to stop. You don't suck for putting some peppers on it but for using a kind of pepper that requires a liability waiver to be served to the public AND running over to hide the milk/ prevent him from helping himself quickly when the pain started to hit. You could have put one of those flakes on it and got your point accross without traumatizing him. 

This is a ""two wrongs dont make it right"" situation, and I probably would have pulled the same stunt when I was younger, but hopefully you feel a little bad about hurting your brother bad enough he cried for an hour."
relationship_advice,et8bagj,t3_ca66sv,1562551712.0,"The emotional aspect of your situation is horrible and 100% not your fault. Both of your parents are being terrible right now, but there is nothing that you can do to make them act more reasonably, because you did nothing to make them act so unreasonably. Do Not apologize OR stir the pot - they are a mess you can not fix. 

The good news is, as much as it sucks to not have EVERYTHING paid for, you can still find a way to do EVERYTHING you had wanted to do (as far as school and your career) just maybe not on the same schedule, or with the same luxury. You might need to take a gap year to: work and yearn money for a car, get an early and informed start on the scholarsip and grant applications you will need to do, and to file the paperwork that seperates you from your parents so that your financial aid is based on just your income. You can still do everything that you wanted to do, it is just going to take more work to make it happen without piles of debt. This summer might suck much more than expected, but it is just a bump in the road and will get better! 

Schools have advisors for potential students who can help you figure out most of this logistical stuff, it is their job to help you figure it out to help you prepare and be ready for school. Talk to the folks at the school you wanted to go to and the local community colleges, and just tell the advisor about your situation and ask for advise and ask what school services and financial aid options they have. There are a wide variety of programs for students that are different everywhere. Some schools will waive the room and board costs if you are a ""resident support staff"" in the dorms, some can connect you with a well paid apprenticeship while you are taking related classes, all kinds of things specifically designed for young adults who are trying to get some education and start a career. You will not be the only person in class figuring it all out on your own for the first time, and the school has an interest in helping you figure it out. 

If you are in the USA  ""211.org"" can be really helpful for all kinds of things. It is resource referral based on your location and the subject, so you can search ""clark county job training"" and it will list employment programs in that area. They also have people to chat with on the hotline to recommend resources if you don't know what you are looking for. 

Considering that it is summer right now, I would strongly consider trying to get a job ASAP. It will get you out of the house and show that you are taking the higher road, accepting the situation but not giving up on yourself. Even if your idiot parents do not appreciate it, I am sure other people will.

You got a really rough ""welcome to being an adult"" and things suck right now, but remember that things can and will improve, sometimes just as suddenly too."
