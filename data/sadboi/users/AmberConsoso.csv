I wiped agaim to see if there was more and there was not. I never saw it again after that one bathroom trip and that one wipe.. It also happen about a weekish before my expected period.


Implantation wouldn't happen after a missed period. Implantation is the act of the egg implanting into the uterus. So you wouldn't of missed a period and then got implantation if that makes sense."

You could tell she understood it was a tiny human she can't play with. She just kept. Looking at him and then me then back at him. She adores him. Still to this day. (he is now almost 4)

abortion,ff7nfte,t3_es01md,1579653739.0,"Don't feel alone. This is exactly how I feel too. We got married. Decided we wanted kids so we saved up for over 1.5 years and paid (cash) to reverse my husband's vastecomy. Drove 800 plus miles across country and waited 4 months for the reversal appointment. It took another 10 months and I got pregnant. Literally as soon as I saw the two lines, it was an instant, extremely deep hurtful regret. I instantly felt sick when I found out. I secretly hoped for a miscarriage. At11W pregnant, I flipped my car off the highway going 75mph on accident. I literally don't remember too having much concern if the baby was okay.. I'm 23W, so a miscarriage isn't happening. This sounds so sick, but I wouldn't be too upset if there's something medically wrong during our anatomy scan tomorrow to where the doctor recommends an abortion. I don't want to hurt my husband by expressing that I'm scared to have this baby. I contempated abortion, but I don't think my marriage would be the same. I've joked about adoption and he doesn't seem up for that. Just tells me, ""do you know what I went through to give you this baby? This is what we wanted and you asked me to do."" this whole situation has made me so depressed. We can afford a baby, I just really ask myself why did I want this?

What hurts more is to see how excited my husband is. He goes out and buys baby clothes for our son on the way. Gets excited when he sees how small they are. Each paycheck he plans out what we are buyimg for our son next. I am just so depressed and not excited."
