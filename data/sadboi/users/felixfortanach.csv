mentalhealth,fmu6m65,t3_fx2qdr,1586385549.0,Seriously! I literally joined Reddit a few days ago because my mental health got so bad that I needed to get help somewhere.
mentalhealth,fmk6662,t1_fmjswbz,1586145549.0,"Thank you for your sympathy for me losing my softball season. It did hurt a lot seeing as I've been playing the sport nearly year-round for going on 13 years now. After my classes tomorrow I'm going to try to take a walk to get some exercise in, and if I have time I might draw. I also used to do guided meditations on youtube a lot a few years ago and the body scan comment really reminded me of how much I used to enjoy those! Thank you so much for your help it means a lot!"
mentalhealth,fmk5h2v,t1_fmjszv6,1586145039.0,"Right after I posted this I actually looked up some backgrounds for my phone and laptop with mantras on it and honestly just looking through them made me happy. Same thing with the shower I felt relatively accomplished for the first time in a while.

Tomorrow I'm going to try the small goals and hope that I can keep the momentum going! Thanks so much :)"
