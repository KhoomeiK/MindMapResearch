EatingDisorders,fl4yo7l,t3_fmk8et,1584824530.0,"hello there :) 
listen, I started out like you, and in some ways I still act this way: nobody from the outside would say that I have an eating disorder, if not someone who has it. I look like I feel fine, I eat normally and sometimes I even eat sweets, but for the last few months I have been seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist because it's getting worse and worse. And it all started out with me being unhappy with my belly fat and starting to eat less and less.
Eating disorders vary a lot and are often unrecognisable from the outside: people only notice when you get in a really dangerous situation. 
My advice is that you tell someone professional about this: the earlier you start to do something about, the easier it will be to feel good
