loseit,fej2suo,t3_epb0rj,1579154779.0,"I have been lurking in this sub for the last couple of weeks. Since December 1st I have lost 28 pounds.

Male
Age: 41
SW: 279 lbs
CW: 251 lbs
GW: 215ish(for now)

I didn’t think I’d be down this far so soon, I figured I’d only lose about 6-8 lbs a month.
All I’ve been doing is eating very boring foods. Sugar is my enemy. No sodas no ice cream no cookies.

My average day is a bowl of plain oatmeal for breakfast. Mixed nuts for a snack, raw vegetables and a can of sardines or tuna or salmon for lunch and a light dinner. I drink as much water as I can handle."

Bass,fak8hik,t3_e9jlt0,1576162796.0,"Practice with a metronome, get used to rhythm. If it’s too boring download a drum machine app. Timing is everything. 

Start slow, concentrate on hand position. Learn some basic scales get your fret hand used to stretching, eventually your pinky will be able to hold a note as good as your index finger.

About tone/setup, I almost think it’s beneficial to start out on a bass with high action and bad strings, it’s like training to run in the sand, when you’re getting good at playing the first time you pick up a quality Alembic you’ll be blown away how effortless it is."
