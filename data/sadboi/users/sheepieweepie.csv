Cheating is clearly a no but you really need to sort out some of your issues about being cheated on. It's a pretty normal thing to have happen and feeling emasculated by that is unhelpful, not objectively unasshole-like and frankly a little bit of a backward way to label your feelings.* Your fiance did something wrong but reconciliation doesn't mean you have to go back to her; there is a point at which you possibly could have caused her more emotional trauma from guilt or shame than she caused you from 'emasculating' you or whatever.

Then again, I wasn't engaged to her for years so I guess it's up to you to tell whether her personal pain is real and/or worth allowing her to continue having.

*In my opinion."
