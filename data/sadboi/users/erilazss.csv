Because then youre just repeatinf what they said and they think. And they arent always right.

This is basically lootboxes exept you win money from them. I dont see jumping into a hole as that big of a competition. Also i think his grand money making scheme will last for a week or more, as soon as hackers find a way to exploit it (and it looks very easy to exploit with a script or two) it will probably die. The only thing i have against it is that he brought gambling into minecraft lol. As far as exploiting stupid people goes idc if someone is dumb enoguh to be exploited like that and enjoy it let them be its their life."
