I'll tell you about a few of my dreams, and they are eerily. Both dreams revolve around my own gravesite. My first dream, I saw my gravesite. It was underneath a tree. It felt lonely. 

My next dream, was still about my grave site, and this time I saw the date for which I am to die. Most of my family and friends do not know about these dreams.

Yes, I truly believe that dreams have meaning in them. :)"
pastlives,f0asmg1,t1_f0676k2,1568518386.0,"It's ok :). I know in my next life I will be in Japan. :) Sorry to hear about your depression. If I may give some advise. Please dont wait to talk to someone about your depression. I waited far too long, it is at a point where the only thing that is keeping me alive, is knowing what my next life will be.

I agree, I had a chance to go there. However, like other things in my life, I got messed over. When I joined the Air Force, my recruiter should have told me about the guaranteed contracts. It never came up.

I wish you luck in your future :)"

It causes me to plummet into depression. And ATM, I have been diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. Some of it stems from me, not being home."
pastlives,f03q4g8,t3_d3gpyt,1568365533.0,"Awesome, thank you for sharing :). I'm glad I'm not the only that has such a pull to Japan, that for me atlease causes me pain.

There is no need to explain. There have been area of Japan that resonated with me, such as the famous street in Tokyo. There have been days where I have smelled Sakura trees. Like you I have a connection to it. I never been there, and the closest that I have been was in Alaska.

Question, if I may ask. Have you felt home sick? And you can't explain why?"
