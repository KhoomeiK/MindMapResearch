 Second: I am hearing anecdotal stories of some staff members believing that they can refuse new, temporary assignments.

That authority includes management’s right to make temporary reassignments, require additional training, require staff to complete new competencies or renew old competencies, adjust and change tours of duty and days of duty, etc. so that we ensure that we have the right staff in the right locations at the right times with the capability to care for our Veterans. **Declining emergency reassignments is not an option.**

Third: I remind you of the oath we each took upon becoming a federal employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs: “*I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter.* So help me God.”

**There! Is that enough shame for you? But wait, there's more (the director still believes he is in the Navy which accounts for the flowery language**

Someday, each of us will be asked — maybe by our children or grandchildren — what we did in 2020 as a health care worker, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is our time, our opportunity, and our solemn obligation, to step up; to make an invaluable contribution to our national victory over this disease. And compared to the sacrifices that our parents, grandparents, and Veterans made when the United States called them to Europe, Asia, Korea, Viet Nam, the Middle East, or Afghanistan to fight and defend our lives and liberty, we are fully able, willing, and capable of answering the call today.

I went to a small Catholic school carved out of a convent. All my teachers were nuns.

It was 9 years (K-8) of torture. I was a working class kid in a room full of kids whose parents were professionals. Their parents gifted the schools all kinds of stuff. My parents could barely afford the tuition. The nuns favored the rich kids and I had it rubbed in my face. I was also a fat kid with a funny last name so I got it relentlessly from the kids too. 

Those nine years plus the abuse I got at home deformed me. I learned that no matter how smart or generous I was, I was shit because of my body shape and parents money (or lack thereof). I didn't graduate from that school - I was paroled.

It's been 40 years and I still hate those fuckers (and those nuns) with a passion. I wasn't the only one abused either. I saw kids get it as bad as I did.

I was a junior at a Catholic high school. I've always had trouble in math - always - especially being called to the blackboard to do an equation. I would stand there and freeze and it felt like the whole world was watching.

So I had to pass this last math requirement, Algebra and Trig 2, to have the 3 credits to graduate. I had barely made it through Algebra 1 and Geometry was no so bad - in both I was in lowest tracked student classes. All my other grades, especially English and History, were exemplary. I was a very bright kid with this one weakness.

I asked for tutoring from the teacher. We met once in the auditorium but we had barely got started when the jazz band came on stage and started to rehearse. The teacher was frustrated and just said she would call my mom that night.

Well I witnessed the call. My teacher proposed a deal: if I would hand in the homework, she would not call me to the board and I would pass with a 'gentleman's D.' My mom took the deal. On my behalf.

Oh did I mention my mother was a career teacher?

My parents were paying serious money to send me to that school. But my teacher washed her hands of me and so did my mom - she sold me out. She should have demanded I get the tutoring I asked for.

I remember feeling like the biggest idiot on Earth. No matter how I would excel for the rest of my formal schooling and career, I would always feel stupid. The kid who got a 'gentleman's D' in math. I still feel shame.

One more thing: my mother had my IQ tested when I was 6. She didn't tell me what it was until I was an adult. The reason? She didn't want me ""to get a big head.""

I have no doubt it was higher than hers, or my father for that matter. My mom went into education when she flunked out of nursing school. She failed chemistry."

It took decades after I left home to figure out my family was NOT like everyone else's. My father physically and early on, sexually abused me and then ignored me altogether when it became clear I was not going to be his 'mini me.'

My sister hated me from the time we were in pre-school. That's another story. But my mom, who died 7 years ago - the fog gradually lifted from me during that time - what she did was as bad. She no only gaslit me to the point I was questioning every ability I had but she shamed me to coming to her after my father died to talk about the abuse and why she did nothing.

Her words would ring in my ears forever: ""Oh your father hardly EVER his you."" 

After 40 years and over 30 shrinks I finally got my diagnoses of BPD and C-PTSD to add to GAD and dysthemia. To this day I'm surprised I got as far as I did in life.

Didn't other kids' dad beat and humiliate them? Didn't anyone else's mom knock them down a peg or two all the time? A sister who spread rumors and yelled the most vile things at me in front of my parents but I couldn't lash back because she was a girl?

My high school classmates' Facebook sites all show smiley happy extended families, great careers, stability. I have pieces of what could have been. 

And I thought it was a family like any other. And whatever problems I had with it were all my fault. The neighbors, the rest of my extended family, didn't have a clue."

The cops eventually got wise (Collier County Florida) and the next time they arrested them both to sort it out. She had clocked the poor guy with a phone receiver, shattering it. She said he had it coming because he threw the phone at her (they had a conventional phone not cell)"

I never had it in me to be a farmer anyway. And I wonder what these people are going to grow on poisoned land with an inhospitable climate? So stockpile whatever food you can and prepare to shelter in place. I don't kid myself though - I can do it for awhile but there's a .45 with my name on it eventually."
