sleep,fr4i4jj,t1_fr437wr,1589888877.0,Wait a sec... “our bodies and minds need to go through the sleep cycles at nighttime for you to not fall apart”. Isn’t the whole point of this sub for us like-minded night owls to revel in the fact that a name for a disorder exists - DSPD - and it validates our inability to adhere to a normal sleep schedule?
DSPD,fr0wn5n,t3_glz9by,1589808453.0,"Wow! Definitely gonna give this a read. The snippet about ‘sensory stimulation’ during sleep is particularly interesting... I have always found that if I play a doco on TV or on my laptop on YouTube when I’m in bed, I fall asleep STRAIGHT away. People always said that was cyanide for sleep hygiene, but perhaps it mimics the talking and noises we would’ve been surrounded by when falling asleep in groups... I’ve always found it strange that there was only a very rigid set of guidelines around sleep... namely: quiet, cold, dark, from 10-6 and non-stop sleep. Human beings are not one-size-fits-all you know."

It feels cheap and rushed and does not pay homage to the original cast or characters at all. We’re introduced to characters 100 years down the line and given no reason to care for them as they are just cheap composites of shipped couples we never even got to see. Underwhelmed... 

I did like elements of it though. The blue spider lily blooming only during the day was a great twist and emblematic of Croc-Sensei reverse uno card technique. I just feel mostly... meh about it. I heard though that Croc-sensei had to wrap it up fairly quickly due to family reasons, so that kind of makes sense as to why it feels so rushed.

I think INTJs suffer the most from emotional hurt cause we just bottle them up and then they foment inside of us and we try to deal with them logically and logic doesn’t always work from something irrational as emotion. So then it builds up and up and up and then we explode in paroxysms of tears and sadness, which would have never have happened if we didn’t think we had to be so strong and deal with emotion logically. I think with feelings you just gotta feel them and let them go. Experience them, don’t try to dissect them logically, because some feelings aren’t ever going to be rational."
