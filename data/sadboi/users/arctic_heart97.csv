FreeCompliments,fh2r6uk,t3_emka2e,1581259806.0,I love your eye color!
FreeCompliments,fh2r0xp,t3_epn308,1581259719.0,I know that feel. Hope it went amazing. ü•∞
BPD,fh2popy,t3_f16t4c,1581259214.0,I‚Äôm struggling with getting to this point.
BPD,fh1oxdt,t1_fh1nmsh,1581219996.0,"That‚Äôs part of the reason I started smoking cigarettes, so I would have an excuse to get away for at least a few minutes."
BPD,fh1nxl9,t1_fh1nrhf,1581219233.0,"That‚Äôs a completely valid question. I was worried about feeling smothered. It actually doesn‚Äôt feel weighted at all once you get used to it. It sounds weird, but the only way I can think to describe it is how you ‚Äúthought‚Äù a blanket should feel as a child. Giving you security, making you feel warm and safe and held."
BPD,fh1ic4g,t3_f100id,1581215941.0,"I think a lot of mine comes from the trauma I experienced in going to court ordered visitation t my dad‚Äôs house. He was physically abusive to my brothers, and verbally/emotionally abusive to me. I would cry my eyes out screaming when I got homesick for my grandparents house. I got to the point where I would get physically sick and vomit when I got homesick and he would HAVE to take me home. I‚Äôd be better as soon as I got settled in back at my grandparents‚Äô."
BPD,fh1ffuw,t1_fh1fcv5,1581214563.0,My weighted blanket has helped me so much. Ironically a gift from my FP lol... but it really helps me when I feel all flighty and can‚Äôt stop crying
BPD,fh1eueh,t1_fh1eaws,1581214306.0,"Yes! You described it perfectly. I‚Äôve had a major backslide over the past couple months. I was promoted to manager at my job I‚Äôd been at for two years, back in college, saving up for an apartment... then my grandmother had a huge health scare and now has to have someone here with her almost 24/7 and was hospitalized for a month and a half. I‚Äôve dug myself back into a hole since then, changed jobs, my grades are slipping and I‚Äôve starting avoiding people and places that I once wouldn‚Äôt have. I was like this even more extremely when I was eighteen (now 22) and I‚Äôm trying to remain self aware and not dissociate back into the way I was before. I used to not be able to keep jobs, dropped out of school, and quit talking to all my friends because I thought they hated me."
BPD,fh1d2gp,t1_fh1co3p,1581213653.0,"I house/pet sit for people. I feel the most at home when I stay at someone else‚Äôs house with my FP lol. I like the feeling of having my own space and not being questioned about the strange things I do. I‚Äôve lived with my grandmother all my life. While this is a comfortable setting for me, she has to have a say in every move I make which really stresses me out. I long for freedom. I can‚Äôt move out because she needs me here to help."
BPD,fh10nsj,t1_fh10alv,1581209552.0,"It‚Äôs like when I shop, I get these ideas in my head that when I finally get ‚Äúx‚Äù item, I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôve become the version of myself that I want to be lol. My family constantly complains about me because I make good money and should be able to live like a normal adult, but one would think I still have a part time after school job like in high school lol"
BPD,fh0y0vp,t1_fh0xtp1,1581208770.0,YES. I love traveling for this reason. But also doesn‚Äôt help the fact that my lack of impulse control makes me terrible with managing money haha.
BPD,fh0xsb2,t3_f100id,1581208679.0,"We were together for three and a half years, but we broke up in July. It‚Äôs honestly been the best thing ever, though. We still see each other just as much, if not more. And we‚Äôre best friends that love each other. Removing the label really helped us both. I messed up and made the terrible mistake of cheating, but I went through a long period of time where I didn‚Äôt even feel real. He understands that about me, and has loved me even through all the hurt I‚Äôve caused."
BPD,fh0wirh,t1_fh0wddl,1581208311.0,Same here... but I hate feeling like my happiness lies within another person and feel like I‚Äôm constantly annoying him and being needy...
BPD,fh0vvaz,t3_f100id,1581208097.0,"Partying always makes me feel good, because everyone gets happy and is ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Until all that wears off, and then feeling like everyone hates you again. Lol"
