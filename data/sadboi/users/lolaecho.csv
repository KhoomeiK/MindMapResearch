teenagers,fqcfooi,t1_fqcdjq6,1589257053.0,What’s your opinion on not learning this kind of thing in the education system? Do you think it’s important for people to know this kind of stuff or should school be more focused on preparing people for a job and learning about their specific country?

EatingDisorders,fq9c14a,t3_ghkpli,1589193114.0,"The best thing you can do is keep making sure you are nourishing your body, as hair isn't a necessity for our survival it can be one of the first things to go when your body isn't receiving enough to fully survive. Even though you are eating better and taking vitamins, your body will focus on more important aspects such as repairing any damage to organs/your digestive system rather than your hair. If you do commit to the recovery and ensure that you're feeding your body, you should be on the right track. For me, when I began recovery, my hair actually got worse before it got better which my nutritionist told me was very normal. Keep going, it will get better! Maybe think of this as a time you can explore with hats/hairbands/accessories that you may not usually like if you want to cover up your hair for the time being. Wishing you well, I really hope everything works out for you! 

When it comes to actual timing, everyone is different, but for me my hair stopped thinning a few months into my recovery."

He's asian and instead of announcing at the beginning that he was going to be saying the word as part of the presentation he somehow tried to get through the presentation without saying it, and every time he failed he would apologise to the class. It was so hard not to laugh at how stressed he was getting over accidentally saying it, when it seemed like it would be so preventable."

JUSTNOMIL,faxyo7e,t3_eaog5o,1576392104.0,"As someone who has suffered with anorexia, I sympathise with the struggles she is clearly facing but I have no sympathy for how she is treating you. I understand her mindset of wanting to be the smallest, and feeding everybody else, it's so common with eating disorders, but how she's talking and treating you is unforgivable. How does your SO feel about this? I think you're going to have to set some boundaries especially with a child on the way, as you may be able to see how ridiculous her comments are but a young child will not. Sorry you're dealing with this, I hope things start going better. 

Some advice on how to respond to her:

* when she comments on weight gain, pregnancy or non-pregnancy related: respond like the weight gain is nothing but a **positive** thing (which is obviously is in pregnancy), when she comments on someone else gaining weight it's her ED mind reassuring herself that others are failing and she's succeeding, so make sure you show that weight gain is NOT failing because it's not. 
*  when she asks you to weigh yourself: ""oh no thank you! I don't want my weight to be a big part of my life, it's not a habit I want to pass on to my children.""
* when she talks about you being able to keep weight off: ""yes, I'm lucky I suppose, but it would also be ok for me to put some weight on, I would still be healthy!""
* DO NOT LET HER COMMENT ON YOUR CHILD'S WEIGHT! In any circumstance. You are the parent, you will be visiting the doctors, you will know if your child is healthy. This is something to be so strict about. No comments about your child wanting seconds at dinner, no comments about the child joining a sport to burn calories. Don't let anything slide. Eating disorders actually have a genetic component, so don't let her talk to your children in the way she talks to you. 

Is she in any sort of treatment like seeing a therapist? Living with an ED is horrible, and sounds very far gone if she so shamelessly talking about weight and food like this, especially to a pregnant woman."

Sitting and marching on the streets every weekend when there's no outcome becomes a bit pointless. I don't agree with the level of violence that the protests have come to but it's like a game with the police/government. 

Peaceful protest = no result. Slightly more aggressive protest = teargas. Teargas = more violent protests. More violent protests = more oppression/brutality by police. Police brutality = Full violence in protests. 

New laws by the HK government like the mask ban, and police firing live rounds also adds to the violence and anger from the protesters."
HongKong,f77i0wi,t1_f77gg77,1573457659.0,"Mob mentality is a crazy thing. I agree completely with this, protesters need to be seen as the good guys as their cause is the right cause.  Setting someone on fire does not add to the cause, and is likely to destroy other countries support for Hong Kong. 

In the same way that the police who have murdered and shot protesters should be arrested, the few protesters behind this action should be arrested for attempted murder, because that's what this was."

So the stats that say people aren't getting divorced doesn't really mean people are happier, just that they aren't getting divorced no matter how they feel.

The things you described like calling him to wish him luck, buy him socks, care about him talking care of his hygiene aren't really that absurd for family members to do. The MIL coming in in the mornings is weird, but comes off more as different ideas of boundaries between your family and his.  

It sounds more like you're jealous of them rather than the other way around. Of course this is all just speculation as I don't know you guys but maybe try to think about their way of thinking a little more. Just because you two are together, doesn't mean he has to change his relationship with his family.

I would say that just showing up, even if it's for some stretching, maybe a short routine, for the first few times you go to the gym is a reasonable way to eye up how people tend to behave there, learn some etiquette and get a general understanding of the gym. 

OP just go! The point of the gym is to get sweaty and red faced! If you're super scared of not knowing the basics, watch some videos of how to do basic exercises so you can apply what you've learnt when you get there.

I would say talk to your mum and uncle about how they feel about the situation. This isn't your fault at all by the way, standing up to someone bullying you in a rational way the way you did is something to be proud of. It's also not even that crazy that you're living with your mother, if you're both happy it's not exactly hurting anybody. 

About repairing the relationship: it seems like she's been quite nasty towards you for a while. What relationship are you trying to repair? Do you enjoy spending time with her, especially in the last couple of years? Just because you're related somebody it doesn't mean you must have a relationship with them. Not to say you completely cut someone off and act cold, but you can be polite but just not spend time with them. 

I understand you're going to want to hang out with your cousins because it's not like they've done anything wrong, but consider that they shouldn't be seeing you being verbally berated. Little cousins often idolise their older cousins (I know I did), so them witnessing you just taking the horrible things that their parents throw at you will really normalise accepting that kind of behaviour. This isn't a huge priority for you because you should put yourself first but if you're worried about seeing them it's something to consider.  

Hope all goes well."

If so then that could be reason she’s been distant but if not then she could unfortunately just be losing interest. Have you talked to her about your feelings yet?

JUSTNOMIL,f5s5re5,t3_dp1kkb,1572412978.0,"If you do something with just your side of the family instead of inviting both sides an excluding her, I'm sure there'll be no hard feelings. You could do a small lunch/dinner in the next week with your SO and MIL to show you value and care for her, but you just kept saturday to your immediate family."
JUSTNOMIL,f5s5lhq,t3_doutm4,1572412786.0,"I'm not sure if this is going to change anything, but when talking with her/about her to family members don't use emotional terms. Don't say you ""hate her"", because you can easily seem irrational and overdramatic even though you're perfectly reasonable to feel the way you do. Instead just give examples of behaviour you don't agree with, and calmly explain why you don't think she would be a good influence on your children. Simply saying you don't really agree with the way she treats you and your FH shows real maturity on your half and demonstrates to her family that you aren't overreacting, you're standing your ground. Make it seem it's not extremely personal against her (even though it is because she's made it personal with the disgusting comments about your miscarriage) but it's a disagreement with general behaviour you don't want to normalise to your child. 

If she is going to treat you like this, there's no reason for her to need to see her grandchild. I hope everything goes well for you!"
AmItheAsshole,f5puqhv,t3_dos4gp,1572368196.0,NTA. I don’t really have any advice because I’m a teenager and not familiar with wedding politics but your sister seems like a real bitch. Also your fiancé seems lovely.
AmItheAsshole,f5pu86o,t3_dos6x9,1572367881.0,"NAH If you talked about it calmly and included his feelings. It sucks you haven’t been able to orgasm, but remember how it makes him feel to have never made his wife orgasm. In addition, it would be weird for him not to freak out about this. Very few people would react well to their Lon term partner suddenly throwing out that they want to fuck a prostitute. 

Escorts aren’t going to guarantee an orgasm. Sex therapy is a thing you could look into. It’s something you can do both alone and as a couple."

AmItheAsshole,f5ptitm,t3_doopid,1572367434.0,"NAH. Not her fault she has better survival instincts that you. Not your fault you’re upset she has better survival instincts than you. 

Kinda going towards you being TA if you “take a team from her” though"
AmItheAsshole,f5pt6z7,t3_dok80d,1572367225.0,"NTA.

To be fully honest, she just sounds a kinda boring as a bit miserable. I wouldn’t be able to maintain a relationship like this, and that’s coming from a mixed race feminist."
EatingDisorders,f5kp3s3,t3_do6s09,1572267699.0,"You need to be candid with your doctor about the cause of your weight loss and your ED. You say you have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, maybe it's time you change that to at least gain a support system. One of the biggest issues I had with my ED was my resting heart rate dropped down to about 40 like yours, this was why I was so urgently pushed into recovery. Despite your other health conditions, your ED is almost definitely affecting your heart rate. Please try to talk to your doctor about this, maybe he can refer you to a psychologist?  

If you are not taking in enough calories/protein, weight lifting will only strain what little muscle you have left. Your heart is a muscle, and it will be losing mass as the rest of your body is losing mass. This is extremely dangerous as you can imagine. A smaller and weaker heart will have a much harder time pumping blood (hence the decreasing heart rate), and intense exercise can push your heart too hard and in worse case scenario to the point of failure/heart attack.

PLEASE GET HELP! What you are doing is so dangerous, especially with your pre-existing condition. I know it's so hard and the idea of stopping your behaviour seems like the worst thing in the world, I've been there. But it needs to be done, and it's so worth it. I took a break from working out for a little while to help my recovery and due to the dangers of working out with a weak heart, but now since I can exercise again I've noticed a huge change. I genuinely enjoy it for the workout rather than for the calories burnt and I have so much more energy to use. 

I hope everything goes well for you and you get the help you deserve. Nobody deserves to feel this way about their body and feel so controlled by food. 

Best of luck, send me a message anytime you just need to chat. xx"

JUSTNOMIL,f5f6rq8,t3_dnpopm,1572178830.0,"I feel like I'm in a similar, yet different viewpoint of your situation. I'm a teenage girl and my grandmother clearly has issues with food and body image. She makes comments about food in all circumstances, and makes comments about overweight people on the street. It's difficult for me to now hear these comments as I have been suffering from and ED for the past year. 

I would ask you to have the difficult talk with your partner about your MIL's comments and your worries for yourself and for your children. This isn't something to mess around with."
