wemetonline,f8pydxg,t1_f8p5xst,1574709255.0,"Hi, cptsd here. My body and mind are all fucked up, 24/7. I also have a tumultuous love history. Divorce really fucked my life up. I spent a year on myself, even if I hated myself. I told myself that I'd learn to like being alone before I would worry about finding someone. Yeah it can be lonely. But you owe it to yourself and the people in your life to properly communicate your pain. Honest to god, when I stopped trying to get a partner, I had so much more energy to focus on my interests. Partners can add to your life but they shouldn't be a central part. It's not ride or die or nothing at all, people are more complicated than that."

Best advice I'd give myself at 19: go no contact, do a favor for your brain and search what medication might help, find a group cptsd meeting near you, and do cardio. Feeling like you have to be somewhere quickly or else you'll die can put a toll on your heart. Put that fast beating heart to good use."

It's different from an abuser that you came in contact with later in life. This person you've been told is supposed to care for you,  to be the one person that has you if you have no one else.

So far I've had time to think about why my abuser did what they did, and theres no logic, or rhyme or reason to anything about it. You're allowed to be angry. You're allowed to dissociate. You're allowed to react to trauma. You shouldn't be expected to act like nothing happened when clearly it affects everything you do. 

I did counseling for 4 years and the only thing it taught me was that I'm really fucked up. Medicine doesn't work, I dont trust doctors, what the hell am I supposed to do?

I feel cheated, like someone took my life away from me. But most of the time I'm just dealing with psychosis and triggers. If nothing else, you've got a community here that actually knows what you're going through."

The last time I tried to apologize to my brother, he told me not to talk to him. I haven't spoken to him in 3 years. My other brother coddles my abuser, and because of that I can't be in contact with him either. I haven't spoken to him in almost a year."
CPTSD,f6miti3,t3_ds1o5y,1572973729.0,"It's hard to say what is and isnt dissociation for me.

I'll stare at a screen at work and my eyes will defocus to a point where everything blurs (even if I'm wearing contacts) I'll forget where I am, what I'm doing.

I'll see someone crossing the street and dismantle any importance to what they wear or how they walk. I'll just see a form with different colors and shapes.

I'll see myself and forget that I have bones or that someone is driving me while I sit behind my eyes and watch.

I'll forget how to read. It will look like lines to me.

If its dissociation during or after an episode, I'll forget where I am. If I'm in a closed room I will believe that nothing exists outside of this tiny space. Outside is nothing, there are no exits, light doesn't exist, I'm only seeing different colors on a painting. 

Etc etc."

I would consider taking a cultural anthropology class or a class revolving around the culture of capitalism.
