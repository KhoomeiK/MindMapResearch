Reasons to support Bernie:

keywords: Record (of consistency), Achievements, Trump beater, Economical plans

(1) If you’re looking for a friend, a partner or a manager for your business etc., what do you seek most in them? You want somebody you can trust. Bernie has been talking about the same things for nearly 5 decades of his political life even when they were not popular, standing up in picket lines for even longer than that (he even got arrested in 1963 for protesting over segregation), so you know you can trust him.

(2) He has a huge list of achievements too even though he was a loner independent in his whole political career. Just imagine what he can do as a president. My personal favorites: passing a $12-billion bill to bring primary healthcare to more than 9 million people, and passing a $5-billion bill to expand the VA, and forcing Amazon to pay $15/ hour to more than 350k employees, and of course, passing more amendments than anyone during his 16 years in the House of Representatives, and that when Republicans held the house, for which he is dubbed ‘Amendment King’.

(3) Bernie is the only candidate who has more individual donors than Trump, and has reached 1 million individual donors faster than any presidential candidate in the history of USA, so there you go.

(4) Also, if you just listen to him (must-watch interview, it has 10 million views, probably the most watched long-format interview of a politician on YouTube) instead of how corporate media misleadingly portrays him (another must-watch short video), you’ll know he just makes sense, especially economically.

For example, Medicare for All, estimated to cost $32 trillion over 10 years, will actually SAVE at least hundreds of billions of dollars per year than the current system (The USA is the only developed country that doesn't have universal healthcare, even many third world countries like Mexico and the whole South America do, nothing fancy here).

His Green New Deal, estimated to cost $16 trillion over 15 years, is the only plan that takes into account that we have just a decade to cut our carbon emissions in half, and this plan will pay for itself by the revenues (especially from the 20 million jobs it will create) and savings it will make. Also, doing nothing would result in economic losses worth $70 trillion.

His policies like tuition-free college, wall street speculation tax (which will be used for student loan cancellation) are already common in Europe. Student loan debt cancellation requires a very small tax on wall street speculations ranging between 0.005% to 0.5%.

Tuition-free college costs only $70 billion a year, which is way less than the $80 billion added by Trump to the already bloated military budget in 2017 (the military budget of the USA is larger than the next 10 nations combined, of which 8 countries are actually allies of the USA.)

If you still think his plans are expensive, just remember that just Wall Street bailout cost $29 trillion.

.....

My personal reason for supporting Bernie: You may not agree with him, maybe not even with half of his policies, but even then, you’ll never again have another politician in your lifetime who has been consistently saying the same things, protesting over discrimination and injustice for over 4 decades. You’ll have many independent politicians, you’ll have many honest politicians, but you’ll never have somebody who will have a record of 4 decades of fiercely fighting for you, standing up in picket lines for you, getting really angry when you faced injustice, standing up for you to the most powerful people in politics and corporate industries without a hint of fear. You'll never have somebody who will keep speaking for you even in an empty Congress. Even if you don’t agree with him, you know he is that one man in Congress who genuinely cares about you. 

You're lucky to have a Bernard Sanders in your lifetime."
