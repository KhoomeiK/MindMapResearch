AskDocs,fr6awqe,t1_fr4zu46,1589922986.0,"First off i am not a doctor, i am a mental health specialist in a emergency room, but that doesn’t mean too much so if i am wrong doctors please correct me. 

Zoloft is a SSRI, like most common antidepressants. These SSRIs and SNRIs are known to cause fatigue, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and many others undesirable effects. Bupropion is a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and while it comes with its own profile of side effects, it is reported to promote wakefulness, less weight gain or weight loss, and less sexual problems. It is probably as effective as SSRIs on its own, but is also beneficial as a adjunct to a SSRI, meaning they can be taken together to combat the side effects of zoloft that I mentioned earlier. That would probably be the best bet for someone already taking zoloft, because coming off of a SSRI can be VERY tricky, and a slow taper is absolutely mandatory. 

One of the notable side effects of bupropion is a decrease in seizure threshold, but a therapeutic doses that shouldn’t be a problem unless you have a history of seizures. 

Hope this helps! Do some research, talk to your doctor, and stay healthy. Good luck!"

Worry loops, negative thought patterns, extreme health related anxiety, bearable but there is always room for things to go wrong even when sober during the day. I cant bring myself to cut back to a few days a week. I just cant seem to tell myself now is the time. I work in a emergency room, so im still working, and 12 hour shifts are a bitch especially when u gotta wake up and work another one. Thats why i like to dissociate with weed then i get home. But i feel like if i could just smoke 3 or 4 hell even 5 days a week to start, then slowly work down to less and less days, then i would feel a whole lot better in general. 

I have always had extremely tough will power, but i havent had any luck with this. When i want to take a break i just convince myself that this isnt really affecting me the way i think it is, and that this is all in my head. In fact thats another thing i have noticed, things get stuck in my head a lot more. If i think someone is looking at me weird, i will start believe it, then find a reason for them to think that, and then act differently in front of them, things like that. I guess the shit has just started to loosen my grip on reality. Im not fuckin psychotic or any shit like that, i have just had quite a few where i cant get a grip and bring myself back to my normal, positive, confident, outgoing self. 

Anyway, you have any tips on how to cut back to weekends?

StackAdvice,fp4vayg,t3_gb9rr1,1588308320.0,"Fascinating, thanks for sharing. During the winter months i run into low mood issues, always have. Its like towards the end of fall, i feel things shift, and get a unsettling feeling in my gut, then in winter i just move through the motions, have some good and not so good days, but try my best to stay positive until spring. 

I have gotten much better at dealing with the winter time low mood, through exercise, supplements, meditation, and getting outside more even though its cold and gross.

Every spring including this one i begin to feel exactly what you are describing. A strange sense of anxiety, racing thoughts, i am more emotional, and i feel like there is never enough time to get done what i need to get done. I am constantly second guessing myself, becoming frustrated easily, and harder on myself (constantly telling myself i am stupid, not good enough, or worthless after the smallest inconvenience or something doesn’t workout perfectly), and i find it almost impossible to concentrate even with my adhd meds

By summer i begin to even out and enjoy life way more. Things are brighter, im less stressed and less critical of myself, and things just generally run more smoothly. I always assumed the transition into spring brought on the anxiety. Vit D and 5htp seems to help in the winter. 

I know this is probably pointless to you and provides no help, but I’ve really been struggling with the spring time symptoms that are similar to what you described. I have been slacking on the vit d so that could contribute. I also have adhd-pi."
