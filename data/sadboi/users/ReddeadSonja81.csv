depression,fmrhjmd,t3_fwxgfk,1586323391.0,"Happy birthday! I have had many birthdays like that, you feel almost guilty for your sadness because you know everyone did their best to do/say/buy/make something for you and you appreciate every bit off it, BUT. Despite all that id feel this deep, nagging, sad ache in the pit of my stomach that nothing could soothe but going to sleep and moving onto the next day. You're prob like oh right like it's just that easy. I hope I remember this myself for my next birthday but seriously the sooner I could sleep and get onto the next day the better."
depression,fmrgum7,t3_fwxuht,1586322803.0,"Yes just about any true crime/murder show like the first 48, forensic files, everything ever on Discovery ID , unfortunately we don't have that channel but you get the idea. No I absolutely do NOT want to harm anyone or be in any profession dealing with death or dead bodies. It's something about about they put everything together in the end and you know 99% of the time there will be a resolution."

toxicparents,fm589uq,t1_fm55lw8,1585768157.0,"Thank you! It helps coming on here and seeing there are other people dealing with the same heartache and pain. I am SO familiar with the guilt trips, my mom's favorite time to start that is when according to her I'm spending too much time with my friends. ""Guess you don't like us (her and my toxic older brother) anymore."""
Drugs,fepfnc3,t3_eavcsc,1579319307.0,"Thank you so much for your story, and also congrats for coming so far! I am currently trying to get away from the meth myself but literally everyone I know has it and can get it, even childhood friends that I definitely consider family we've known each other for so long and have been through allot together! I've dropped everyone but them and I understand Im going to have to drop them too but I'm scared of the loneliness too. I wish I had some amazing advice to give you but all I know is that I've started getting back into hobbies Ive abandoned and am finding that I'm actually kinda good still. It's my one anchor I plan on clinging to until something gets better. I hope you find yours."

depression,ez8kfjy,t3_ct268j,1567746424.0,"Heres one for ya to give you a glimpse of how not normal my family is: I see my dad a quite a few times a week and he has always been there for me BUT I m not allowed to know where he lives. Ever so often he would bring me a catalog or something he got in the mail he thought id find interesting, with the address either blacked out or removed somehow. Well about 10 years ago he brought me something with the address blacked out as usual only this time I could make out the road name, and it happened to be a road I know exactly how to get to. So me and my best (only) friend decided to go out there one day to see if I could spot his vehicle. We had only made it maybe 2 miles down the road and there, 2nd house on the left was his truck. I can see it like I'm there right now. I didnt stop or even slow down, I just said ""there's his truck, and I don't know the other vehicles"" , then drove maybe another mile or so, then turned around and cried the whole way home. My dad still has no idea I did that and know where he lives, had to set up his Roku account the other day and pretend I didn't know shit when it can't to the address part, that was also accompanied by the longest pause in human history. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love my dad , but at the same time this stuff is so so painful and we never have talked about it, my dad is in his early 80s and time is running out and I'm still scared to death to even bring it up. My family doesn't talk about shit. Sorry for the novel."

ADHD,eyxxhbl,t3_czdvgx,1567565094.0,"Omg I know your struggle and it gets so frustrating when someone asks ""Do you know...?"" , And my best automatic response has become ""Everyone knows I'm horrible with names, do you have a picture."" , Thankfully with everyone having a evil Facebook account , it resolves that particular b problem. But running into someone that's a whole 'nother embarrassing minefield.. lmk when you have a smooth response for that situation."
