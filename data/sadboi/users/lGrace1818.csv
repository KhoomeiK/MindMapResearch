Then I went to the doctor yesterday for a hearing test and they asked me to pick up one of the cards for hospital and I legit just couldn’t pick it up it was so embarrassing for me, I started to get tears in my eyes and I apologized and the nurse grabbed it for me and said it’s okay.

I know it’s hard and super easy for me to say right now when I feel okay, but when I feel bad I hate it when people say it to me. Maybe switch doctors or find a specialist that deals with just anxiety"
Anxiety,eu8k9q6,t3_cf9io8,1563558768.0,"It takes awhile for the symptoms to go away, I’m only on 5mg, 3 times a day and it took a good month for the dizziness and the thoughts and everything else to go away.

Anxiety,eu8jk8n,t3_cfafgf,1563558387.0,"Go to your doctor!!! I never suggest this unless I feel it’s needed, I graduated last year and I didn’t start having GAD until this year mine happened the same way yours did I stopped wanting to go to work the panic attacks got worse my anxiety got worse and I just didn’t wanna go. I went to my doctor and prescribed me an antidepressant and to make a long story short it didn’t help, but he only gave it to me because I had to Atleast take one to do a swab test to see what type of medications would fit better. I won’t go back on antidepressants now. Months after I wouldn’t go on any medication I tried just sticking out, just getting a lower stress job. And then it got worse to the point where I was having thoughts of Suicide and I didn’t even want to die but it was just a thought. So I went back to the doctor and got on anti-anxiety medication and sleeping pills and some things to help my physical side of anxiety. And yes it doesn’t fix it it doesn’t magically heal me but I don’t have full blown panic attack I cry, I still have some off the wall thoughts now and then but I will be seeing a therapist next week. But you gotta want this, you gotta get on schedule and stick to it."
Anxiety,eu8irbd,t3_cf91tw,1563557920.0,"So pretty much when I first started having anxiety I went into the ER like 5 times. I explained to them, that I legit felt awful, my heart was racing I couldn’t stop crying I was scared of everything couldn’t drive couldn’t eat didn’t drink anything nothing. They did EKGs and blood test and nothing came back. My anxiety got so bad that I would pass out, so that’s why I would go to the ER so much, they just continued the same test. They pretty much gave me some meds to calm me down usually was benzo which I highly don’t recommend unless actually prescribed by your regular doctor because they’re addicting and very bad for you long term. They really can’t do anything for you unless you are wanting to harm yourself/harm others. It’s better to call a therapist, and call your regular doctor and set appts and try to wait it out as bad as that sounds. But usually if you tell them it’s kinda an emergency they can try to scratch you in closer."

You have to find things to distract you. And it’s hard it’s hard to take the first step and there are days where you take a couple steps back and you end up right where you were but you have control, you just gotta find a way to regain it. Breathe and get it done. And if someone hasn’t told you lately I’m proud of you.

Right now I’m prescribed Topamax 25mg for them and it’s a seizure medication because of my blood pressure already being low. But when I was off medication it was very hard to do things with tremors. I was constantly needing something in my hands or needing to move my foot so no one noticed.
