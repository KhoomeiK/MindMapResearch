kingcobrajfs,fpftxa1,t1_fpfrvou,1588583359.0,I'm afraid that the day will come where he looks in the mirror and sees exactly what we see. Then he will loose the illusion of himself. And im sure as fuck he won't be able to handle it.
kingcobrajfs,fpfr31k,t1_fpfozw1,1588580438.0,"Wow man.. This really makes me sad.

I never would've thought that this goth cowboy could make me sad and that i would start liking a part of him when i watched him the first time."
kingcobrajfs,fpfolox,t1_fpfn3l0,1588577948.0,"I just watched the spice epidemic video and i see what you mean lmao.

But yeah seeing him in the old doc was so weird. He was surprisingly likeable back then. His jokes where bad then too. But maybe because of the genuine smile he had when making a joke its feels so much different.

Seeing how much worse he got in this short time, i hope he doesnt kill himself in the next few years."
depression,fpfnkpx,t1_fpflh09,1588576941.0,"I'm really sorry to hear that. I'm not the one to say stuff like hang in there or it gets better or something. Because sometimes it just doesnt. But i wish that at some point in the future, there is a world where every single person has a chance to find joy and happiness in life."
depression,fpfkmdk,t1_fpd3wmw,1588574170.0,Maybe im wrong but spending the majority of your life trying to just feel okay is a waste of your life and its so sad that this happens.

beats,fhcbw97,t3_f2gdk8,1581460317.0,I never had anyone rapping over one of my beats and i try to not copy any producers. Am i going in the wrong direction?

2007scape,fejnos7,t1_fejnerz,1579180963.0,It really isn't. But i thought if i grind out my skills my lack of talent wouldn't matter that much.
SuicideWatch,fdfbn9q,t1_fdf94ho,1578357878.0,"Look, im not giving advise from the view of a psychologist or teacher or whatever. If someone comes to me with a problem i will try to help you in a completely different way than a psychologist will. What i try to say is please take in consideration that it can freak people out when officials get involved, especially if you're not sure if they want this or not. As i said people and situations are different and so are the things they need in hard times. I experienced a lot of pain in my life because of depression, self harm and suicide and i wanted to share what i learned from that time. Im sorry that its not the advise a professional would give."
SuicideWatch,fdegpbl,t1_fddxspg,1578338642.0,"Every situation and every person is as different to another as it can get. I understand that. But what i realised is that when someone really, and i mean REALLY, wants to kill himself, they want to kill themselves, and not a visit from a bunch of cops that maybe even put you in a cell. When i was at my lowest point and i had to talk to my friends about whats going on i made them promise to me that they dont call the cops on me no matter what. And i told them if they still do it i will stop thinking about it and just jump from the bridge behind my house. If a person is unsure if life or death is the best option, believe me, havimg the cops in front of your house influences your thinking in a bad way."
SuicideWatch,fddwwk0,t1_fddcuh3,1578325966.0,"This may seem like the perfect answer at first but it isnt, especially letting the police know. If in my situation back then my friends acted like this i would have  definitely gone trough with the plan of killing myself. Just more spontaniously as i had planned."
IdiotsInCars,fcu2d2a,t1_fct8nws,1577970335.0,Ignorant? Really? Ok go ahead and tell your kids to cross the road without checking then lol.

trashy,f0pkhcn,t1_f0oqigx,1568836567.0,Why do we really always have to generalise... I dont know in which country this was but its absolutely impossible that adults in my country would act this trashy.
beats,eyqa2ey,t3_cxz4r8,1567333576.0,"A lot of people will say u should wait with uploading stuff until you reach a certain point. Imo whenever u feel like uploading, do it! Having just one dude liking and hyping your beats online can give u enough confidence to go on for months or even years."

AskReddit,ex6s8wp,t3_crkgt1,1566050662.0,"So i usually start recording when i hear a song being played that is unreleased. After that i send it to all my friends. Depending on how much i like the song and how the quality of the video is, i watch the video a few times or i export the audio and listen to it as kind of a 'leaked' song."

WhitePeopleTwitter,etaflqy,t1_et9yj8t,1562619108.0,I would say not even identified with but just liked the story as part of their childhood as it is.
WhitePeopleTwitter,etaegvn,t1_et9j87e,1562618394.0,Its not about diversified media. Its about a story being changed that has existed for a while now. Why change Cinderellas story to a indian girls story instead of just making a new story and a new name for a new indian princess?
iamatotalpieceofshit,et90blj,t3_ca4bfp,1562579686.0,If the point was that drinking toilet water is better then drinking any water at all then i guess hes correct.
AskReddit,eqezi1d,t1_eqaemvq,1560012489.0,I can only partially agree. I once got beat up at a monday afternoon at a crowded place from 5 people because they said i fucked someones sister. And i know for sure i didnt and i never saw these people before in my life. But you're right with saying the majority of people are not like this.
