Assistance,fgg5grb,t3_exzn6e,1580754660.0,"Hey here, I hear your situation--it sounds rough. Apartment hunting can take some time, and I want you to find a sense of home. Once you have a place, pets are amazing. They're great companions and help dull the loneliness. It is great to love them as well. 

I found your first post via /r/homeless. Homelessness is lonely, so I get it. But the animal's needs always come first. Any reputable shelter or previous owner would not let you adopt their cat. It is irresponsible and incredibly unfair. 

I know having a pet is a lovely experience--I used to have a sweet cat. You can check out my post history. I had a ton of pics of her and also when I pet-sat with her and other dogs/cats. And yes, I also have experience with homelessness. The first thing I did when I had to leave my home at the time was love her one last time and give her up, because I love her and wanted her to live a life of comfort and happiness. She gave so much to me and she deserved a good life for all she gave me. She went to a home with dogs and cats, ones she knew because I had pet sat for their owner. I know I can never take her back because she has a new home now, and I know that.  She grew to love them there. I want her happiness as a priority.  

Cats are at their best when warm and feeling safe--your future cat can wait for you. You are worth the wait, when you are in a better place.  There will be purring and cuddles then. 

Asking for such huge assistance when you have savings isn't a good use of this sub. I'd be willing to support you though through a card to give you some hope or other things to help you until you find an apartment.

Writeresearch,fft7wc5,t3_ejln7m,1580211465.0,"I have periods of severe binging and purging. The desperation  is insane. The character will like struggle with urges as a patient, especially if it is a general unit.

In an ED unit, bathroom use is strictly monitored. But when I was IP in a general unit, I purged every single day...there were snacks and such in the common area. I'd graze for a long period, walking back and forth to the area until I was ready to purge. Id sneak food up my sleeve so it would look less obvious and to my room to eat it. Then  I'd ask to ""shower"". It definitely was not designed to help those with eating disorders. I did this for several days, but there were so many nurses and each was assigned like 6 people per shift so it was hard to not take advantage of that.  I'd just ask a nurse not assigned to me to let me in. 

Food is rough. So maybe that character will eat alone, or just be irritable around meal times. It is hard. Pepper helps. LOTS of pepper and condiments because people with eating disorders freaking love them. The character will likely spend a lot of time planning out their meals (we had to plan for the next day the day before). The menu there interested me more than anything there. I'd stare at it and take a long time to decide, even though I always got the same thing. 

Also, most bulimics are average weight or slightly overweight.  If they are underweight,  that is anorexia, binge/purge subtype. I think the cliche is that people with eating disorders are super thin. In the ED unit, there were people of ALL sizes."

 I read a bit of your post history. Many homeless have past drug addictions, and being in a vulnerable place, some have been kicked out for relapsing. It is sad to see. The good thing is that we have a recovery support group here open for anyone in recovery. I'm hoping maybe the one you're thinking of will have support like that as well. 

Just a FYI, a lot of shelters do have rules and expectations like curfew, employment (e.g must show proof of job or looking for work if applicable), work toward housing, etc.   A lot of people who leave voluntarily struggle with rules and authority. So just be prepared to know that it will not be a home, but a place with things in place to keep everyone safe. That said, I like the rules and structure and it helped me pull out of a darker place. 

Stick with a few good people, work closely with the case managers, and find things on the outside to give you hope. 

I say give it a try over living it on the streets. You'll have your basic needs met to give you the mental energy to get your life together. I've lived in my car, and I just got crazier, sadder and more hopeless.

You have to be awake in order to stay alive. When you dont know where you'll be hit next, or if someone is trying a new way of hurting you, the body needs to be a bit more present. I know in moments where I have felt, ""This is different. I might actually die today"" the fear felt intense. 

In a ""planned"" or predictable situation where someone knows they will be hurt or how they'll be hurt, the mind and body can try to escape it by dissociating. It's like the body and mind are smart enough to know it can pretend to escape.

homeless,f9rzb8n,t1_f9rw7ng,1575583414.0,"have you heard of AmeriCorps? it's a great residential program for young adults and you get to know your cohort while getting to pick your location. Some of them travel through various states to work on projects. You get housing, a stipend/educational award allowance and real life experience...without the instability of being homeless. 

I'm not saying it is a better option, just wanted to share in case it might interest you:

homeless,f9rcr9d,t3_e6d8n0,1575574500.0,"You need a plan ""from then on"". If you plan to spend the last $50 on a ticket to VA, start researching options for places to stay, apply for FoodShare, etc. BEFORE you go. You NEED a plan.

Control what you can. Do your work. Prepare. Know your options. You'll head downhill deeper than you ever have if you just show up randomly in a city."
homeless,f9o4226,t1_f9nysec,1575496067.0,"This. OP won't find themselves through homelessness. Basic needs have to be met. Happiness can't really be found just by moving if you're unhappy with who you are. No matter where you go, there you are. 

Move with intention, not randomly if you're seeking a place to go."
homeless,f9o2nlq,t1_f9o2dih,1575495247.0,"I have spent so much time in motels as well...periodically, I'll find a random motel key and they're triggering as fuck. Horrible waste of money and I went insane in them. Is the Airbnb something you can do long-term/equal to ""normal"" rental costs?"
homeless,f9o1c19,t3_e65z66,1575494503.0,"Honestly, in your situation, I'd try to get into a shelter ASAP. They can help you job search and connect you with services--I'm guessing you don't have FoodShare or health insurance. You NEED that. 

Then look for a job and start saving for a room to rent when you are able. 

Point blank, you only have a month. You have no money. It is winter. You need help and support to not live day to day."

homeless,f9j2578,t3_e50tsw,1575353142.0,"It's not always dangerous per se, but I feel unsafe. Someone the other day took my picture without asking in the laundry room because I was ""cute"". I was in pajamas, glasses on, frumpy, tired...I try to look like shit and cold but I made the mistake of talking and showing ""interest"". Today someone tried to invite me to pizza...and asked others my relationship status. The one girl wa jealous that I have two people interested  in me and now there is supposed drama. 

It's better than my car so I'm physically more comfortable. But I don't want to feel like a target. I want to be invisible."
homeless,f93obge,t1_f8yqnxd,1575064194.0,"Thank you for asking. We went to two yesterday, one sponsored by a family restaurant and one sponsored by a bar. These were ones that were not hosted by a church, which is where the ""shelter bus"" went.  You could tell some were regular patrons, maybe some who really needed it, and just random people...I have no idea. We could be anonymous and not feel any shame. 

We felt like normal people. They were both ""donations appreciated, but not expected"" and we didn't feel like we looked homeless.  The donation jar was pretty full but it wasn't staffed so the staff didn't know who was who. We didn't wait in a long line, and blended in well. We didn't feel pity or like we were being served--one was just a serve yourself buffet, the other gave out made-up plates. I went with one other person, and it was a beautiful day, being able to appreciate what the love from others without the feeling of ""being served"" or lowly."
homeless,f8ynrrm,t1_f8wqmil,1574950198.0,"Because it has less of a ""us helping them"" mentality. I am a Unitarian Universalist and the ones hosting arent compatible with my own faith. I prefer the non-religious, restaurant-sponsored one since it feels less geared toward the  poor and homeless. 

Faith based ones also tend to have prayer and sharing Biblical information. Again, not compatible with my faith."

homeless,f8jqi4e,t1_f8iyrpr,1574603337.0,A big no to the candles. They attract attention and it is also dangerous. Those hand warmer things tossed under blankets or a heated bottle wrapped up are better options
homeless,f8jl5b7,t1_f8jk24p,1574601622.0,"Oh hi, cheesehead. First, get a hat. Most of your heat escapes from your head. Double layer your socks. Keep a tiny tiny crack for airflow so your breathing doesnt cause too much moisture. Layers are more important than thickness. It doesnt sound like you can get a sleeping bag now, but if you can they work so much better than typical blankets."
