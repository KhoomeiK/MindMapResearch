depression,fp6h4vd,t3_gblamt,1588352251.0,"I know that mental mood of always focusing on the bad, it's something I'm struggling with more and more myself. Here's somethings that sometimes, not always help me:

Literally get up and walk out of the room and do something else, can be reading, writing, coloring, listening to music, watching a TV show you're really into

Listen to music that you know cheers you up, for me I like to listen to a lot of league of legends songs(popstars, rise, Phoenix, legends never die, bring home the glory, world's collide all come to mind for me)

Read a book - I know, I know who reads these days, turns out sometimes all you need is a book to take you away, when I was a kid I read the Alex Rider series.

Watch funny YouTube videos - I've literally spent entire nights/days watching hilarious YouTube videos to keep my mind from creeping up on me

Find a hobby or learn something new for yourself - I'm a software developer and a big part of my job is my ability to adapt and learn new things on the fly. I do some community projects on the side and sometimes it gives me the sense of accomplishment, that I did something cool

Call a friend or family member and see how they are doing - I've sometimes gotten off of work and the first thing I do is call my mom or dad and see how they are doing just so I can talk to someone about their day and my day

Find a movie you've never seen before - my coworkers are always joking about how I've never seen a lot of 'good' or 'classic' movies so I sometimes hit up their list and see if there's anything I'm into watching

Anime - anime was the first thing that saved my ass in college, sword art online season 1 was something that struck home for me and it struck me hard.

Sorry to go on and on but there's a variety of tools in my box I use. Hopefully some of these help you the way they help me."

I literally had a 4 stack in ranked choose not to give callouts over voice or chat because they were all in a discord and then refuse to invite me to the discord just because.

Can't do anything if you don't communicate.

Out of the 3-4 games I used to play every day, only 1 game every other day would have all my teammates working together and having good communications and good strategies. Maybe not winning, but fun enough for me to have a good time.

If you knew you could have more fun and get more wins by having teammates that actually gave a shit and communicated and chose team composition operators, you'd be just as pissed when your teammates don't communicate, chose operators that don't help the team composition, and then proceed to blame you for losing."

I use a 2 pc setup, one for streaming, one for gaming, the capture is sent from the game pc to the stream pc via OBS's NDI plugin. I use OBS on the game pc and VMix(a professional grade production software used in tv, concerts, and live production). VMix shows 0 dropped frames and cpu/gpu usage never exceed 50%.

My Internet speed is as follows: 10-12ms ping, 800 down(pay for 1000), 41 upload(pay for 35) and never faulters or gets unstable, even during peak hours or when gaming. I upload 1080p30 at 6000 to Twitch(I am a twitch affiliate) via the stream pc. The game pc and stream pc have a dedicated network line between them for the NDI feed to make the NDI feed flawless.

It's like people in the community don't want to acknowledge that this game is flawed and is FAR from being a AAA title. THANK YOU! If I could upvote this an infinite number of times I would.
Rainbow6,eq9229m,t3_b0sijk,1559883043.0,"Because I keep on getting fucked over, I started using OBS to record my screen and audio and now every time I get ganged up on or have an issue with a player I open a case and send the video via youtube straight to ubisoft to hopefully get them banned from the platform. If I have to file 50 reports/day to make it happen, so be it. I've adopted a zero tolerance policy on this. Even more so I'm starting to get on chat with ubisoft directly speaking to an agent to report them. Making Ubisoft spend resources on this issue. If enough of us keep doing it, they'll get so bogged down that they will be forced to take more drastic actions to cut the cost of having to deal with toxicity reports."

That video has been my experience thus far on rainbow six. I dropped from gold 2 to that because of aholes like them. This game is garbage until they do something more to control the toxicity.

The instant bans were helping a lot more than not."

help,epuvd7t,t1_ebjppzx,1559517179.0,Exactly. Reddit is nothing but a place where only the popular kiddies get to have their voice heard. I'm a software engineer and often times have unpopular opinions about everything....can't comment or post on anything it's so lame. I'm thinking about making reddit without a downvote arrow so that even the most unpopular opinions get heard. I'm thinking of calling it unreddit.

If I can't have an unpopular opinion and then get trolled with ""git gud"" or ""you're completely wrong"" and those comments get all the upvotes yet all I get are downvotes I don't see how that's fair or supportive. This is the 2nd reddit account I've made and it just seems all reddit is, is a place for people to share their same opinions and troll the f\*ck out of anyone who thinks or says different and then downvote them to silence them.

Rainbow6,epr5b0z,t1_epr4z5h,1559418574.0,"I have plenty of credibility here. I am a software engineer for a living so I know exactly how these games work, how they are supposed to work, and the quality of the execution of said games. Rainbow 6's supposed to work is great, the reality of how they work is poor and isn't worth dog shit. The execution of them is questionable at best...I mean honestly 6+ months for a bug fix...okay...league of legends has had bugs and had them resolved within hours. I kicked ass in halo combat evolved so Im not sure why my credibility is in question.

On top of that:
I can see a shadow of a player outside a window on bank...but they go upside down and shoot me through the window without me even seeing them at all on my screen...irl that doesn't happen.

I fire 3 bullets at someone's head and not 1 bullet registers a hit because I died...if I fired a gun then died irl....the bullets wouldn't just simply disappear. They'd still continue on their trajectory.

I knife someone standing in front of me but it doesn't count because they  shot me? A knife is a knife, especially to the chest or neck.

Do I need to go on? These are all basic things that are really really really hard to fuck up in the first place, but somehow ubisoft seems to have fucked it up."
