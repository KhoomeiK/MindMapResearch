relationship_advice,f6yef0s,t1_f6y9bg3,1573276686.0,He should get professional help does he have a psychologist?  It helps to talk it out. Make sure you keep an eye on him. He’s losing interests in you and with effort so you need to watch out. I’m not trying to put thoughts in your head but I’ve been through this and it gets scary.

AmItheAsshole,ev56enn,t1_ev4yfgz,1564228415.0,Emotional exploitation? I just wanted for my dad to have a conversation with me that wasn’t how was school what did you do did you have fun? It’s that every day and then him getting pissed at something and blaming it on me. I was not exploiting him I wanted him to love me and show that he did. Being open as a men is not wrong at all in fact it should be encouraged.
AmItheAsshole,ev4t4p1,t1_ev4t0tj,1564220902.0,Thank you for that I’m trying my best right now.
AmItheAsshole,ev4t1s9,t1_ev4ssen,1564220854.0,He grew up on a farm where feelings weren’t important. And that you had to be a man. Whereas I am a very emotionally driven person who needs that kind of support so you may be right. Thank you
AmItheAsshole,ev4svoh,t1_ev4smtk,1564220746.0,I never really specified but the reason he said that was because I had CBD oil which I use for my anxiety and he thought that that was detrimental to me and that I just messed up again in his view should have specified that. My bad
