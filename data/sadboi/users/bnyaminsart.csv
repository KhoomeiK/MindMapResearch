I wonder if it would work like, your first playtrough is all your journey and the things you missed you can experience trough the second playtrough with the child of your first character sort of thing, like discussed in another comment. 

There are games which do implement that very well, but it sucks to miss out on significant things, so it is a tricky situtation though."
