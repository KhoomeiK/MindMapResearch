They say the driver “fell asleep at the wheel” but i dont believe that either...with the speed on the car is consistent, and the direction he was traveling was a straight line, ive rewatched this gif many times, there is intent here, maybe not personal but theres no way he just “fell asleep” no way.

AskAstrologers,ex0f3kj,t1_ex06kg4,1565911489.0,"My moms Taurus Sun / Leo ASC. All she does is obsess about how she looks and if she looks ok, consistently asking needing reassurance 24/7

Mind you; she is a beautiful woman. I just wish she could see it and SHUT THE F*CK UP. Damn.

My best friend & father are both leo sun , they love their appearance, physically and outwardly, but arent too cocky about it (like straight up seeking attention vocally). 

Why does Leo have this much of an impact in this realm??? I mean its worse in Women i see but damn... honestly, constantly seeking reassurance makes you look unattractive, even if you are a model. Get over yourself. 

*cheap shot but* The sun may be your ruling planet and all others revolve around you but when it comes to you personally, IT ISNT THIS WAY, learn to love yourself & stop obsessing over how you look

AskAstrologers,ewyq2wf,t3_cqrbzg,1565885108.0,"Shot in the dark but what stands out is your 

Venus in Scorpio (in 1H - House of self) is opposition to your Taurus moon (in 7H - house of “relationships” *moreless*)

I would definitely look into these placements.^
Start with your Moon in the 7H, i feel like that could be a reason why you are more sensitive to your emotions 

And maybe the aspect between those two could cause that? Example; You probably fall into affection or easily and expect a lot from others but get let down (from your own expectations right off the bat) but this aspect shows many other things too"
MadeOfStyrofoam,ewymsv3,t3_cqlipc,1565883669.0,"Yep. This is my situation a bit.

Ive avoided my Boyfriend for a few days because i relapsed, i went over there a couple days ago, we hung out like normal, then we had sex, it was at night so the room was dark and i could hide my legs but he felt them anyways, i tried to keep his hands away from there, he didnt question me about it during but right after we got done... oh man, i mean he didnt see my yeets but he felt them, infact he tried to be nice and talk to me about it but i had no words, i literally just ran out the door...i couldnt say anything. Two days later (today) i asked to see him again... we’ll see how today goes . 

Maybe i ran away because the last time i relapsed he grabbed me and said “we are gonna have a talk if i see this happen again” - although, those were cigarette burn marks on my wrist, this time it was my legs all sliced up. I feel like shit"
