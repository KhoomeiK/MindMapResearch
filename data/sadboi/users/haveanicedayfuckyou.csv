When I finally got an MRI (bulging and herniated disc in lumbar), I literally could not walk, sit, or lie down, it was so painful. My toes were numb and my calf had felt like it was sleeping and had that static feeling. Not to mention the stabbing feeling all throughout my leg. It’s been about 8 months now of practicing good postural habits and I’ve made a lot of improvement and can pretty much walk without pain. I’ve just started sitting more in the last month and it’s slightly painful, but I think overtime I will continue to get better. Hopefully you can get well too.

sabrina,fg98iio,t3_exi2wf,1580635563.0,"100% agree. In addition, I felt Roz, Theo, and Harvey served no substance this season and had virtually zero character development. Harvey is *still* useless even though he’s supposed to be from a witch killer background. Theo used to see a dead ancestor and nothing became of it. Roz only uses the cunning for Sabrina’s interests and never takes the opportunity to use it for her own agenda or at least investigate the cunning curse."
sabrina,fg96rqx,t3_et9lr3,1580634806.0,"The best thing to come out of this season was the special effects makeup of all the monsters, demons, witches, etc. I loved that production didn’t skimp on that. They all looked so cool! 

It’s a shame Caliban’s character seems to have been stoned off. He brought a different dynamic to the plot and was an interesting character. I wish we had gotten to see his back story more. 

I think the writing was inconsistent in terms of character development. Nick sacrificed himself, had trouble coping with it, then is a narcissist? There was virtually no character development from Roz, Theo, or Harvey this season. What happened to Theo seeing his ghost ancestor? Or Harvey’s witch hunter ancestry? Roz should be doing something more with the cunning than just being a crystal ball for Sabrina. They all really need a continuation of their subplots from the previous seasons. This season it seemed like they are only around when Sabrina is, instead of being a cemented character of the show. Also, why wasn’t there anything shown about what happened to Blackwood in those 15 years? It’s just totally skipped through and doesn’t add any substance to the time egg plot. 
And why add the musical scenes? There should have never been any screen time dedicated towards such a thing, it’s a huge distraction to the plot and disruption to the immersion of the show. The writing this season has left me with ill-understanding and subpar believability."

My timeline is very similar to yours. I got the diagnosis in early August of a large sized herniation and an medium sized bulging disk in L4-S1. I actually hit a milestone today and walked a mile at the park, my leg was mildy annoyed but it’s vast progress from day 1 when I literally could not walk a minute. No surgery, epidurals, medication, chiro/PT etc.

One bit of advice you will keep hearing throughout this sub is how the healing process is different for everyone. I can only share information I’ve have learned that has gotten me to where I am now.

Posture is the key in the healing process. Always keep your back straight at minimum. Never curve your back like when you’re trying to touch your toes. If you sneeze, look up while doing so to avoid further irritation to your back. Get lots of sleep in proper position as well. Exercise like walking helps promote blood flow thus helps promote the healing process. Do mcgills big 3 to help strengthen core muscles which will help take stress off your spine. Oh and remember sciatica is not a “no pain no gain” thing, if you do something that produces worsening pain, stop doing it. Good luck!"

Nerve healing is kind of tricky so don’t feel bad if it doesn’t clear up within the timeframe the doc mentioned. What’s important is to keep track of your progress as time goes on. Good luck with recovery.
Sciatica,f7rggjs,t3_dxjuh6,1573980939.0,Was this the first time you’ve gotten an mri?  A shame we have to endure so much pain until we are debilitated and only then does it seem we are finally taken seriously. Do you feel any sciatica still?

Sciatica,f7q4a5o,t3_dxe6nk,1573958583.0,Yeah I get it sometimes around my calf but mostly in my shin. Feeling is very sharp and tight.
Sciatica,f7q0pnq,t3_dx9e9p,1573957161.0,"January 2017. Flareups started and gradually got worse until I struggled to walk. In August 2019 I woke up to the worst pain of my life and went to the ER. L4-S1. It was caused by having poor ass posture. Since bettering my spinal hygiene, pain has subsided a lot in these last 3.5 months. Not quite able to sit for long. Walk a bit weird still, but I am not waking up in pain everyday now which is nice."
Sciatica,f7e70zx,t3_dvp9rv,1573648995.0,"The only thing I can recall about disc hydration is that discs are more hydrated after you sleep since there is no pressure being applied to the discs. Putting pressure on the disc squeezes out the hydrating fluid ie. standing, sitting, walking, exercising etc. will reduce hydration. So it’s pretty normal to go back and forth between rehydrated and dehydrated disc daily. I’m not sure if your particular case is abnormal or not. Anyhow, focusing on water intake sounds like a good start. Also, if you have a pic of your mri’s it’d be cool if you could upload them."
Sciatica,f77efo2,t3_dtzalf,1573453062.0,"In the same boat, it’s been a little over three months since I got the diagnosis of a herniation and bulging disc. The area around my left big toe was numb and my entire foot and calf tingled like raging pins and needles. The sciatic pain in my back and calf was like lightning. Nowadays, I don’t really get much back pain, but I still have a slight pain in my calf and will only get temporary tingles if I move the wrong way. If I sit, I will start to get pain in my back and calf and I’ll start to lean into my left side. When I roll on to my back after doing press ups I’ll get sciatic pain in my back, so I don’t do them anymore.

 I really hope in the next 4 months I can get back to normal. I’m still pretty fragile now but I can never forget the pain I was in the day I went to the ER 3 months ago. To be able to not be in that horrendous pain anymore shows me how far I’ve come and gives me hope I can recover. 

If people aren’t able to provide an explanation on why sciatica down the leg is ‘unhealable’ then I don’t give much weight to their words. You really oughtta seek out information from those who are specialized in the spine/nerves. Add in the factor that each person’s response to injury and healing ability are different too. Just keep up the good postural habits, document your journey, hopefully you’ll beat this thing."

CasualConversation,f6rdwp7,t3_dsmfvm,1573100781.0,This took me on a rollercoaster of emotions.
