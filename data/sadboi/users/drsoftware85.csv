Do you also believe that large businesses and corporations deserve lucrstive tax breaks, bailouts, and tax loopholes because they are job creators and we can ignore the fact that they are reason so many people need so much government assistance.

Economics,fp6usrb,t1_fp6t11o,1588358954.0,"I think we are arguing two different groups of people.  The group you arguing for I'm completely agree with you on, if they refuse to return because the employer isn't following the guidelines, they should be allowed to continue getting benefit until the employer meets those guideline.  
The ones I am say shouldn't keep getting benefit and the state are going to have to threaten to get to return, are people who's employers are providing a safe work environment, but the employees are refusing to return because unemployment, with the federal money, provides more then what they would have gotten in a paycheck.   Are these people being short sighted Yes.  Does it also bring the livable wage argument into play yes but that's not what we are discussing here."
Economics,fp6rz1a,t1_fp6m12v,1588357576.0,"I don't understand your point if people are looking for work and want to work why are states having to theaten to remove benefit to get people to go back to work?  

Do worker have a right to a safe work environment: Yes.  
Do employers have a duty to their employees and customers to provide proper PPE and guidelines to limit potential exposure to the virus: Yes.
If the employer doesn't provide those safety measure should the employee have the right to refuse to work in an environment that is unsafe and exposes them to the virus: Yes 
If employer ask their employees to return to unsafe condition should they be fined and not allowed to operate until they meet the minimum requirements: Yes.  
If a person laid off refuses to look for work or turns down offers made to them should they lose unemployment benefits: YES.  
If a person were Furloughed and their employer ask them to return but they refused should they lose their benefits: Yes."

vermont,fp6nkxp,t1_fp6bc0g,1588355413.0,"Your wrong.  So very very wrong.  If ECFiber only served only along the 89 corridor why are they servicing Pittsfield, Stockbridge, Granville, Hancock, Rochester, Thetford, Vershire, Chelsea?    
Also ECFiber is a nonprofit so it isn't about if an serving an area if profitable but if there are customer there without any viable options for high speed internet, if they were operating in only area that were profitable why would they be investing heavily in areas like Reading, or Tunbridge?"
Economics,fp6insq,t1_fp692re,1588352998.0,"Ok so the job no longer exists, so now that states are opening back people on benefits should start applying for new jobs, like your supposed to when on unemployment because staying on benefits indefinitely isn't an option.  
Now if there were just furloughed and collecting unemployment and the job has been return but employee refuses to return they should no longer get benefits.  
The social distancing (For good or bad) has been lifted federally, so jobs are going to start returning and either the people that worked in those position will return or the employer will find someone to fill those positions.  But if people are refusing to return to work because they get more in unemployment should stop getting benefit for refusing to return to work.  
Those benefits were always meant to be temporary and it seems like people are forgetting that."
Economics,fp66fjk,t1_fp63zel,1588346920.0,My thoughts  exactly.  People seem to forget that unemployment is temporary to help for a little while until someone is able to go back to work or find a new job after being laid off.
learnprogramming,fp4aove,t3_gb15p1,1588295070.0,"I feel you.  I graduated 4 years ago with my CS degree and felt the same way as you do.  I could do basic programming in Java or C++ but really struggled with complex programing problems.  Had taken one class about databases and sql while doing my coursework.  
I applied for anything and everything in the months leading up to graduation and landed an interview for a database programming position.  I knew next to nothing about the company or what the position would entail but showed them a willingness to learn and they offered me a position.  I learned sql and databasing as I went, wiped out an entire production server in my first couple months but they kept me on for two years until the company's database I was hired to help manage pulled their contract leaving me without work.
My next position had me working in raw data and formatting and some lite programming but that only last a few months.  
I then found myself at rural isp installing internet service to customers but saw opportunity to rise in the company quickly.  I am now work in GPON networking alongside the CTO of the company.  
So doesn't matter if you aren't great at programming right now, your degree will get your foot in the door at a lot of small companies and hard work and applying yourself in whatever position you land will get you the skills to succeed."
