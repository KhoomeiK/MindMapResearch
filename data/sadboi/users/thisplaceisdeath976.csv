The initial side effects were headache every morning, slight nausea, extreme fatigue and joint pain for about a month. My significant other and children noticed a change in my mood within a week, and I noticed too. 

After two months I felt my rage, extreme irritability, and feeling of constantly needing to be doing something or talking return and my doc upped the dose to 200mg and Ativan to take as needed. I feel better than I did in August, but I think I may need to up the carbamazepine again.

One thing I have noticed is that if I drink beer before taking my carbamazepine I wake up extremely ill even though I’ve only had four or so beers. 

The best thing about it is the sleep I have been getting. I never realized how messed up my sleep was and I always woke up exhausted, now I generally wake up feeling rested.. probably because my mind isn’t racing 24/7."

I think it’s rude to do that to kids anyway. They are tired and you’re sitting in a restaurant with nothing for them to do, wtf do you think they’re going to do? Entertain themselves quietly? Nope.

This is actually extremely common because moms pour so much of ourselves into our children that when they aren’t around we don’t know wtf to do. Imagine having nine people constantly needing something from you and then having zero people needing something. It can be a shock to the psyche. 

It’s not co-dependence. It’s just called being a mom. 

When my kids were little it was always weird to have me-time, now that they are older and more independent it’s not as bad, but I still miss those little shits when I’m gone from them for more than a night.
