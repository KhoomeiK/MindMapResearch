Again thank you for the advice! Lucky slept pretty a good amount this time!"

I got my work schedule changed which means I’m lying  in bed more with nothing but my thoughts. Sleeping well helps me feel a little better. As of now 8 hours is a goal."

SonicTheHedgehog,f1eaodq,t1_f1e3se7,1569417567.0,"There’s no company that owns motion controls and I’m using motion controls as an example. But if you look on how more people embraced Wii motion controls versus the reception of Playstation move then you’ll get what I mean.

Does Nintendo have better games with motion controls? Yes, they do. They also had more time and admittedly they use it in a better way. At the same time though it’s hard to find someone preferring to play Super Smash bros. or Twilight princess with motion controls contrast to traditional controls. Especially after the hype died for the Wii and people realized traditional controllers were better for most games they play."
SonicTheHedgehog,f1dk0b6,t1_f1dcldg,1569386896.0,"I swear that Nintendo games get biased opinions from everyone. Yes, a lot of their games are good but I feel that most of their games are highly overrated. 

Nintendo: *Adds weird motion controls* It’s innovated and fun.

Anyone else: *Adds weird motion controls* It’s bizarre and cumbersome."
SonicTheHedgehog,f1djkoz,t1_f1dd9dt,1569386428.0,"Especially at the time most of 2D Sonic games were received well with critics, Sonic Advances series and Rush. Contrast there were big critics like gamespot, and IGN giving the 3D games average to poor reviews. Even Sonic heroes, which I think was one of the franchises’ best games, was given average reviews and some negative feedback."
