I've found there's not much you can do on bigger women except use your forearm to hold back the stomach or palms to hold back the thighs while laying down one strip at a time. One of my esthy friends has a mobile wax pot. Maybe that would help? So you're not running back in forth to the pot. Same with sugaring, that helps a lot too so you can move a little quicker.
I've had clients swing both legs off the side of the table before which is super uncomfortable for them but it helps open the area a little more. I also will place their hands for them where they need to hold that way they can feel the tension I need and know exactly where to hold but I've had bigger women that either aren't strong enough to or have so much that they can't hold. I've also found for between the cheeks having them get on hands and knees is better than knees to chest/rolling on their side.

Walked out the door with enough to pay my rent and cover business costs.

I think the bottom line though is some people treat money like drugs and others aren't privileged enough to be in an environment where they can practice financial literacy. They spend it when its in their pocket and you can scream at these people until you're blue in the face and they will never learn financial literacy or they can't without going hungry. And to pass judgment on these people I think is wrong! It's the way they're raised in a broken system (at least in the US) and we need to fix the system before trying to judge and over correct the ones that can't or don't have the privilege to learn, practice or hear about financial literacy.

AMA,fjexixr,t1_fjer478,1583280059.0,"He's not diagnosed- it was a different time...however we did have a family therapist psuedo diagnose him as a narcissist. He's very successful and very generous, but only to people he feels he can benefit from. He also does things that I would consider risk taking behavior and we believe he does it bc it's the only way he can truly feel.


A good example is he bought me a washer and dryer as a house warming *gift*  this being the key word bc it comes with attachments. Now I'm expected to watch his cats while he's out of town, back up his opinions and gang up on my brother, and help him with other tasks. He gives ""gifts"" and money as a manipulation tactic to get people to do stuff for him.


He doesn't have ""normal"" reactions to sad or happy things. Like he'll be sad but it doesn't last long and it's either a 1/10 reaction or a 12/10 reaction. For example he was planning on going to his highschool ""best friend""'s funeral and he forgot and missed it. That's a once in a life time thing right? For his former best friend. He went ""dang"" when he remembered and continued what he was doing. Similar when another ""best friend"" from college died. When my sister in law announced she was pregnant, and did it in the cutest way geared towards my dad, had EVERYONE in tears my dad went ""wow that's great"" and kind of shoved the gift away and turned the TV on. Same when I bought a house and announced my engagement. 


He is incapable of taking responsibility for his actions. And his charming-ness will have you believe he absolutely did not do what you said he did. Example: today he sent my sister in law a rude text. There are screenshots. Proof! And my dad somehow convinced all 3 of us (me, SIL, and brother) that he didn't mean it the way he said it. Took several hours for us to turn around and go ""wait a second..."". The man could sell swamp water to an alligator. 


He can also be particularly cruel, verbally and physically. He never hit us. He one time stuffed garbage in my pillowcase for leaving a dish out and not putting in the dishwasher. Took all the furniture out of my room and unhinged my door because I talked back. Took the battery out of my car when I missed school. Told me he ""felt sorry for whoever *has* to marry me"" when we had a disagreement. Sent my brother and I to a treatment facility as teenagers for acting out instead of just once asking ""are you ok?"". He told me on one of my first days at public highschool to bring back money from my hoe-ing (I was wearing shorts he perceived too short.) His sense of what's appropriate is extremely skewed. He 100% takes pleasure when he realises he's hurting someone, but I think most the time he doesn't even realise the gravity of what he's done. But he steps up to the plate as a dad, but only if other people see what he's done. He's painted a great image for the outside world that he is a good dad.


And you ask anyone and they shower my dad with praises. ""He's so generous, funny, charismatic"" but only his kids really see through the act. He is so manipulative and charming he convinced my mom to buy him a house and switch her voter registration from Democrat to Republican."
AMA,fjeqk2x,t1_fjeq72i,1583276471.0,I'm glad you're as entertained as I am lol I've always wanted insight on my dad's mind but I know I'll never get an honest answer.

And that is not to say that sociopaths don't deserve the same love as a ""normal"" person does. But I won't dare compare my highschool education to a trained professional.
