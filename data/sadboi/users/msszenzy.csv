All about lust is hilarious and adorable, so that might be the lighter one among the ones I've listed.

Arthurian,fplt1wx,t3_gdllv0,1588718924.0,"There's no specific about Camelot, no one knows!
But other important locations are Carmelide, Tintagel and Orkneys. And I suppose France because it's where Lancelot comes from. And Corbenic.

About artifacts, definetely the sword in stone is a must, as it was what made Arthur King. Then the Holy Grail. 
I cannot think about any other important objects.

Regarding Avalon, it's usually set in Glastonbury. But any location should be fine, also Scotland has a tradition of seeing Mordred as the hero and Arthur as the villain.

Also Morgause is Mordred's mom, why would she seal him away :(

Also not sure what you mean with magic folk? There's no magic division in Arthuriana."

I want to lay in bed at night thinking about how the plot could be changed, events reimagined, and new themes introduced. Fortunately, despite its simplicity on the surface, Merlin provides all that.""

I'm baffled, shocked. I absolutely disagree. I started watching Merlin and quite enjoyed the first season, only to trip into the show's sexism and laziness. Characters changed characterisation based on the needed plot, and the show framed THE SAME ACTIONS as negative when used by some characters and positive when used by others. 

There's no character's growth, everyone is encased. Merlin and Arthur never really bond, their relationship stays mostly the same.

Morgana changes the most, but her change mostly delete her previous character (she used to fight for justice).

Arthur was such a bad character that they had to add Agravaine to justify why he's so incompetent, after Uther died.

Female characters were mostly evil and killed (I did a count and stats ages ago, I'll have to find it), only a few were on the good side.

The story is absolutely full of inconsistent themes and events, that sometimes are there so that the authors can tick off the ""Arthurian episode"" (Arthur sends away Guinevere because he doesn't want to kill her after she kissed Lancelot.. what? They're not married. And no one knows she kissed Lancelot but Arthur, so there's no problem that the kingdom would want revenge).

I'm so mad."

heavensvault,fl92nbo,t3_fne1gz,1584939053.0,"Addition: the game was not saving there, so after reloading for the third time and redoing the put tablet on hopper I just let the game run (water bubbling) for about five or six minutes (or more). I tried multiple times to leave, but it was like an invisible wall was on the path. The robot was not talking, just standing in the water. Finally, only after some time, I tried again and Aliya said ""back to the ship"".
Sadly, I would have preferred to explore more and not destroy Iox, but I guess there was no other way to get unstuck."

Just running the exe file this time worked and actually opened the installation."

And I keep in contact with my friends in Australia more, to make sure they are okay! (even if I am sad I can't wander around with them)."
