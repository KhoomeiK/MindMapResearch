I think part of it is not fully understanding the material, and part is finding it really boring. (I'm trying not to use the H word because then I will completely shut down.)

The textbooks are the driest, most technical thing I've ever read. The strategy our professor set out is to highlight the books while making notes on PC. That way we can reference quickly, & also have the important bits marked out.

This was taking a really long time for the last book, so I thought I'd go through and highlight, then go back a second time to type it out. Now instead of taking a week or two to go through the book highlighting, I feel like I've accidentally doubled the time.

I'm really not looking forward to the exams. Then there's another course. Then more exams. And if somehow I pass all the exams then I'll need to prove I know these things in interviews. (I feel like I'm not learning things, I'm just copying from book to PC.) And if I somehow convince them I know the material, the job is sounding less and less appealing.
