However, I share your concern. As important as it is to open up, I simply don't understand why people are resistant to wearing masks. If everyone wore them, like in some East Asian countries, our risk would be greatly reduced and we could open up faster.

Plus there's a certain lack of empathy among those who cavalierly say the immunocompromised should just stay home. I'm one of those people. I have to work like everyone else. I have to buy groceries. I have to run errands. My rent doesn't get excused because of my medical issues. My work won't give me unlimited time off. My bills won't get paid without an income.

BipolarReddit,fqplp36,t3_gk6by8,1589549279.0,"I don't know of this will help explain but I can give you a perspective as a psychologist (who happens to have bipolar). Mental health pros have certain things that they have to - ethically and legally - ask into if they come up. Doing a thorough assessment for suicide and violence/homicide risk are the two biggest ones. So if I hear certain things that make me concerned a patient might be having urges to hurt someone, I have to ask follow ups about how serious the urges are, if they have a particular person in mind, if they have a specific plan to do this. There's a famous legal case called Tarasoff that requires me to inform the police AND the potential victim if I know that a patient has a specific plan to kill them or inflict serious bodily harm.

That said, there are supportive and empathetic ways to ask these questions and there are more ham handed ways. I'm sorry if you've encountered the latter a lot. In my practice, I use a lot of judgment about when and how deeply to ask about these issues. For instance, if a patient says, ""Sometimes I daydream about killing her"", I may ask if that's ever been a serious thought for them, but if they say no, I drop it."

The unanswered questions have to do with what you're doing right now to take care of your mental health.

The other confound would be social distancing. Because we're on these drugs, and thus immunocompromised, many of us are taking extra precautions to prevent getting COVID. So is it the hydroxychloroquine or extra steps?

A child whose dad leaves, as you described your actions, will always wonder if that father really loves them, particularly if the father lives far away.

So anyway, you grow up in those circumstances and you feel more and more emotionally distant. You feel more and more resentful of this person who left and was - still is - absent. That resentment hardens. 

And if a parent is lucky, like you are, when that child grows up, they realize that it's possible to have a connection to this person who left, who hurt you.
