BradLeone,fqprcd2,t1_fqppnwt,1589552523.0,"to be honest I've seen a lot of comments about Amiel being pretentious or Andy being neurotic when paired with Brad.
I am not saying Rapo is perfect or whatever, it's just BA is such a positive place for me and it sometimes seems to me like people just need to have someone bad there, so they made him the villain.
I'm not trying to tell people who to like but I don't think he deserves to be so harshly criticized all the time. Some of the people there are more likable, some are less, but not everyone is great on camera and they all are important in creating the videos and the current direction the magazine is going. 
Adam deserves credit for what he's doing and even though i doubt he reads the comments, i personally would feel like shit if i helped to create something so loved by people, yet only got hate from it.

Harvey's recklessness and emotional outbursts with physical aggression? wow, isn't he the man.
Jessica's manipulation and self-service? what a strong woman.
Louis' abusive, disgusting and straight psychotic behaviour and treatment of his proteges? that's a great role model!
and the shit cherry on the top of this bullshit sundae is fucking Mike who fakes his whole career, takes LSATS for money, is unbearably self righteous and hypocritical and still everyone constantly praise and support him.

i really like this show but my suspension of disbelief is humongous when i watch it because all the characters constantly backstab each other and are never held accountable and when they are about to be, we are supposed to feel sorry for them. I'm not even talking about breaking the law, but they say they are a family and what not, yet they are HORRIBLE to each other. in my opinion, they are enjoyable as characters but not as people."

So there wasn't a good exploration of Geralt and Yennefer falling in love as they get to know eachother, just their meetings and short conversations. which is why i always felt like this big love is at least embellished and she doesn't really care that much. idk, maybe i just don't understand love"

Bojack his whole life tried his hardest, gave his all and his parents blamed him and hated him, never truly appreciating his efforts or accepting him as a person.
We don't fully know how Todd was, but he was thrown out of his home as a direct result of being a lazy slob. i love him as a character but in reality people like him, who smoke, eat and play games all day aren't likable or fun to be around. yes, he has a great attitude and now is helpful and caring but he didn't endure years of abuse, just an incident as a direct result of his actions. don't compare that.
Bojack 100% has a personality disorder, substance abuse problem and depression. Todd may be hurt but that's not quite the same. If you're convinced everyone in your life hates you, you're not playing a victim, you actually feel hurt. how the hell do you expect him to be positive when he hates himself so much? you know why people go to therapy? because you really need to work hard and long to change that sort of world view."
