As for what to eat, specifically, beans and tofu are a really awesome cheap and easy swap out for meat. Feeling like some tacos tonight? Cool, do up all your regular taco shit (refried beans, ground up mexican flavored meat stuff, lettuce, salsa, guac and sour cream) BUT use [this tofu recipe rather than ground up cow parts](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/vegan-tofu-taco-crumbles/) and just use some [vegan sour cream](https://www.livekindly.co/vegan-sour-cream-substitutes/). Or, like, skip the tofu entirely if you want because you already have beans on there. 

This is obviously just one example but I thought I'd share mostly because that tofu recipe is the best ever.

Plant-based milks are easy to come by. Oat milk is my favorite. Tofu makes a great breakfast scramble rather than eggs. Oatmeal is vegan, and many basic cereals. 

Most bread is vegan! Lots of vegan ""lunch meats"" out there too. And vegan cheeeses and sausages and burgers and cakes and pies and ice creams and like whatever.

I'm starting to ramble because it's a vague question and there's just SO MUCH you can eat besides meat. Let me know if you want more direct links or recipes. I am more than happy to help!

Omnivores had the lowest intake of Mg, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin and folic acid. Vegans reported low intakes of Ca and a marginal consumption of the vitamins D and B12.

Despite negligible dietary vitamin B12 intake in the vegan group, deficiency of this particular vitamin was low in all groups thanks to widespread use of supplements.

news,fbhf3a5,t1_fbhduxl,1576872144.0,"I think you're misunderstanding what B12 is. B12 is a vitamin that is produced by bacteria that live in soil (and feces). To make the B12, the bacteria need a mineral called cobalt. B12 is produced in our body but is too far down our our digestive tracks to be absorbed, so it is excreted in our feces. This is basically how animals get B12, from eating grass with dirt/their own feces on it, or pecking around in the dirt for worms, etc. 

Herbivorous animals such as gorillas get plenty of B12 because they, too, are eating ""dirty"" plants and drinking from streams which are unfiltered and also contain B12.

Unfortunately, due to the declining soil quality from intensive over-farming, as well as the extensive washing of produce, B12 isn't really found in the plants in our diet NOR in the diet of farmed animals. In fact, something like 95% of B12 supplements are not for human consumption, but actually given to farmed animals. So, not only is B12 an animal-derived vitamin, taking a B12 supplement directly rather than eating an animal that was given the same supplementation is really more like cutting out the middle man.

I hope that explained it well. Those are all things I didn't know either before becoming vegan."

Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria, not animals or plants. As such, animals, including humans, must obtain it directly or indirectly from bacteria. It can be found in bacteria-laden manure and unsanitized water, though we obviously should not be consuming either of those things. It can also be found in the human intestinal tract, but itâ€™s not clear whether sufficient amounts are made and absorbed there to meet our nutritional needs.

Many animal foods contain high amounts of vitamin B12 because they accumulate this bacterial product during their lives, and livestock are often supplemented with vitamin B12 in their feed. These animals are also exposed to manure in their living conditions, with some even being fed manure. (For example, cows are sometimes fed poultry waste.) In fact, the [FDA has reported](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/AntimicrobialResistance/NationalAntimicrobialResistanceMonitoringSystem/UCM257587.pdf) that most meats are contaminated with fecal bacteria.

In the past, vitamin B12 from bacteria was also naturally and more reliably present in plant foods. Today, however, with modern hygienic practices more effectively cleaning and sanitizing produce, along with soil being exposed to more antibiotics and pesticides, most plant foods are no longer reliable sources of this bacterial product.

Interestingly, some plant foods still contain some vitamin B12, including certain mushrooms and [seaweed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803097). And, many plant-based food products, such as cereals, non-dairy milks, and nutritional yeast, are now fortified with a crystalline form of vitamin B12, making them good sources of vitamin B12.

The crystalline form of vitamin B12, which is the form used in fortified foods and supplements, is actually preferable to the protein-bound form present in animal foods because itâ€™s generally easier for our bodies to absorb."

They eat a lot of beans, grains, veggies, fruits, nuts and seeds and they take b12. All three of them are very healthy, happy, and developmentally advanced for their respective ages."
