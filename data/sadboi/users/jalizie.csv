It seems like most of vegans (atleast on this subreddit) don't understand that mostly only in western countries it's possible to be vegan but the further you go from it the harder it is. When i got back home(Eastern Europe), I would've litterally starved if I tried to be vegan because even to find vegetarian stuff is difficult as hell. Want to have quick snack? Sike, the only vegetarian stuff is crisps and chocolate. Going to restaurant? Well maybe you will find some soup with no meat in it. Unless you will cook everything yourself at home, goodluck being vegan. Geez even in London it can be pain in the ass to find something ""eatable"" because it really depends on the area. 
I'm all for being vegan but it's not always as easy. I tought joining this subreddit will help me but y'all judgemental as hell."
