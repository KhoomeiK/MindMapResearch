depression,f9j129x,t3_e57f2e,1575352009.0,"Yes, I‚Äôm really feeling it this year too. Going to the gym, watching a tv show, hanging out/calling a friend, or even cooking a new recipe seems to distract it. I have to force myself to do those things though. All I want to do when I get home from work is lay in bed until it‚Äôs time to go to sleep."

depression,ewevpho,t3_cntom7,1565339918.0,"It took me about a year and a half to find a job after graduating. Everyday was a constant battle of anxiety and wondering my self worth. Not saying it‚Äôll take you that long, but please hang in there! You have a goal to find one, so that is the important part. The rest will come within time. 

As for your family and boyfriend, they‚Äôre there for you, so don‚Äôt feel bad about having to vent/express what you‚Äôre going through! If you need anyone else to talk to please feel free to dm anytime. 

I wish you luck with everything you‚Äôre going through and know it‚Äôll get better!"
