1. He existed as a man. The historian Josephus grew up in a priestly family in first-century Palestine and wrote only decades after Jesus’ death. Jesus’ known associates, such as Jesus’ brother James, were his contemporaries. The historical and cultural context was second nature to Josephus. “If any Jewish writer were ever in a position to know about the non-existence of Jesus, it would have been Josephus. His implicit affirmation of the existence of Jesus has been, and still is, the most significant obstacle for those who argue that the extra-Biblical evidence is not probative on this point,” Robert Van Voorst observes.32 And Tacitus was careful enough not to report real executions of nonexistent people.
2. His personal name was Jesus, as Josephus informs us.
3. He was called Christos in Greek, which is a translation of the Hebrew word Messiah, both of which mean “anointed” or “(the) anointed one,” as Josephus states and Tacitus implies, unaware, by reporting, as Romans thought, that his name was Christus.
4. He had a brother named James (Jacob), as Josephus reports.
5. He won over both Jews and “Greeks” (i.e., Gentiles of Hellenistic culture), according to Josephus, although it is anachronistic to say that they were “many” at the end of his life. Large growth in the number of Jesus’ actual followers came only after his death.
6. Jewish leaders of the day expressed unfavorable opinions about him, at least according to some versions of the Testimonium Flavianum.
7. Pilate rendered the decision that he should be executed, as both Tacitus and Josephus state.
8. His execution was specifically by crucifixion, according to Josephus.
9. He was executed during Pontius Pilate’s governorship over Judea (26–36 C.E.), as Josephus implies and Tacitus states, adding that it was during Tiberius’s reign."

DarkHumorAndMemes,fnd82p0,t1_fnd7kxn,1586862307.0,"
1. DOCUMENTATION

Thousands of ancient, hand-copied documents—referred to as “manuscripts”— provide proof of the New Testament and Old Testament’s historical consistency. In fact, there is significantly more documentation for the books of the Bible than there are for other historically recognized authors and literature, such as Plato and The Iliad.

2. ARCHEOLOGICAL FINDINGS

Excavation sites and artifacts also provide evidence that many of the events, people and places mentioned in the Bible really existed—such as the city Jericho and its famous walls or the Hittites, a people group once thought by skeptics to be a myth.

3. THE LIFE OF JESUS 

The fact that Jesus was a true, historical person is clearly documented by Jewish manuscripts, even before the Apostle Paul and the writers of Gospels provided their eye witness accounts. Other ancient cultural documents also reference his existence. For instance, the Roman leader and historian Tacitus wrote:

“Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus …”

4. FULFILLED PROPHECIES

The Bible contains hundreds, even thousands, of prophecies that have been fulfilled. They include detailed descriptions of events that would later happen to the Jewish people and surrounding nations, as well as prophecies about the life and death of Christ.

5. REDEEMED LIVES

The Bible speaks to the condition of the human soul in a way that has life-changing impact. There are countless examples of people whose lives have been radically changed by the Bible. Just to name a few:

Lewis-C.S. Lewis, a former atheist who became one of the world’s most influential Christian apologists.

-John Newton, a slave-ship master who converted to Christianity and later wrote the famous hymn, “Amazing Grace.”

-Norma McCorvey, the woman at the heart of the U.S. Supreme Court case that resulted in nationwide legalized abortion, Roe v. Wade. She then spoke for the right of the preborn to live.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUTH

These five evidences are just a portion of what exists that confirms the reliability of the Bible. Examining the evidence and coming to the conclusion that the Bible is true is a transformational realization."
