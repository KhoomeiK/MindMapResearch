ac_newhorizons,fom2ns5,t3_g887dk,1587876643.0,"I know there is a villager cycle but there are so many characters it might be a while before they come again. I also know there’s something to do with personality types already present in your island and what personality types you’d encounter on mystery island tours so perhaps that’s the same thing with the campsite? I’m unsure. I don’t think it’s very likely they’ll come back soon though, I’ll tell you that for sure."
ac_newhorizons,fom2g7u,t1_folggus,1587876485.0,It’s been a little while. I’ve never adopted or put any up but I just remember seeing so many people talking about how their adopted villagers would disappear. Apparently they did patch it but you’re definitely right it could’ve been a complication with TT.
TheSimsBuilding,fole10m,t1_fof5kgw,1587860222.0,It’s just a laptop:/ no buttons
AnimalCrossing,fnxelhx,t1_fnvryb4,1587337039.0,Could also be an effect of their choice of rivers and landscaping
AnimalCrossing,fnvqdnj,t1_fnv9zs0,1587301928.0,the game counts going back in time as its own new day.
AnimalCrossing,fnvq493,t1_fnvcemn,1587301719.0,I think special characters just disappear and can’t be brought back once they’re gone. I did it with Zipper on April1st and didnt get to see him on my first island.
AnimalCrossing,fnvowod,t1_fnvj1o5,1587300721.0,Did you play every single day?
AnimalCrossing,fnvo8h5,t1_fnvmnet,1587300157.0,I specifically chose a layout with the plaza toward the back center. I’m sure others just did the same because they knew they couldn’t move it later
AnimalCrossing,fnvo1pr,t1_fnvnomm,1587299994.0,A lot of people on this thread have been saying ignoring and bullying don’t actually help get villagers out. I’ve never tried so I can’t speak from experience but I’ve read a lot of people saying it’s purely random when they decide to move. Try Amiibo cards is my only advice :/
AnimalCrossing,fnvnv6b,t1_fnvnugc,1587299838.0,Pretty sure it’s just random

AnimalCrossing,fnrqo7m,t1_fnrqa3y,1587197954.0,"Unsure exactly what you mean but I would think the answer is no. The building will still be there but the game will count every time change as a new day. So you had one new day TT to tomorrow, and then another new day TT back, and then another new day when tomorrow comes."
ac_newhorizons,fnrezyu,t1_fnq8u0q,1587186970.0,Update here is a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ac_newhorizons/comments/fofooe/what_personality_will_your_next_villager_be_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  I have found that seems to suggest you can’t encounter the same type of villagers after a certain point

ac_newhorizons,fnnxnhm,t3_g2sxnq,1587104966.0,I think you could load in a bunch of the same type if you wanted to but the game probably won’t naturally “spawn” that amount for you
ac_newhorizons,fnnxjig,t1_fnnx94e,1587104860.0,"sorry, no it’s 30 days from when it was built. I was just suggesting if you didnt want to lose the island resident achievement you could still time skip through each day and sign on to keep the streak. The achievement doesn’t affect the build"
ac_newhorizons,fnnx8fa,t1_fnndxyc,1587104573.0,Mystery islands lock your time. The time you arrive is the time it will stay on the mystery island until you leave
ac_newhorizons,fnnx4ar,t1_fnniwm5,1587104470.0,Hey according to some datamines it is 30 days from the day the shop was built. If you time skip I would recommend doing some tedious work in skipping ahead and logging on each “day” until you get to the 30th but that’s just because I like to keep my NookStop streak and check in with the villagers.

ac_newhorizons,fngawss,t1_fnddmvb,1586926817.0,it just feels like all the fan favorites are gone and the game will burnout very quickly bc theres not much else past a certain point

ac_newhorizons,fmk76r5,t1_fmhtlr0,1586146306.0,"Because i already put the work into catching my sturgeons, stringfish, and emperor butterflies. It’s important to me that theyre in my museum. I’m not thinking of it as a restart of a new island, I’m trying to match my progress"

AnimalCrossing,fmgxla3,t3_fqqxv8,1586060589.0,I had to restart my game because I bought a new switch and I’m worried I won’t get anything for Easter... Will Zipper send me a letter? Can I still get the prize and collect eggs and such?:(

psychologystudents,fdgznff,t1_fderqhf,1578412161.0,"Yeah I agree, I think most people are just swept up in thinking you can only use psychology in medical application. I’m interested in using a B.A. for speech pathology or market analysis."
psychologystudents,fdgzith,t1_fddqmxg,1578412080.0,"Yeah! That’s what I want to use the degree for. I want a B.A. to enter other more specific fields. I plan on entering speech pathology after undergrad, but I’ve also been thinking of pushing my psych degree to market analysis... It seems so awesome to me that psychology can help you everywhere. Really sad about all the stigma around it."
psychologystudents,fdgzd7g,t1_fddlutb,1578411981.0,Yes I agree completely. The older generation is who doesn’t understand the basis of all this. It seems to me like the best field to work with because the job opportunities will only increase as more and more people see how it underlies EVERYTHING! Such boomers
psychologystudents,fdgz8oq,t1_fddhpze,1578411901.0,These all seem like such stigma to me. I know what I want to do...  I think you only need a master’s to be paid well in the medical fields. I’m more interested in a B.A. to enter different programs with it. Good to know what others think about it though. Very strange! I would think being a business major is “not knowing what to do” you know?
psychologystudents,fdgyyz8,t1_fddf0r7,1578411729.0,"Yeah I’m not really interested in being a psychologist, rather I just really enjoy the subject and want to use its applications elsewhere. I’m thinking of being a market analyst."
psychologystudents,fdgyvf0,t1_fddd1b6,1578411665.0,I think if you’re planning on becoming a psychologist or psychiatrist or something like that you should get higher degrees but I feel like a bachelors degree is fine if youre going into different fields and careers.
psychologystudents,fdgyshd,t1_fdd7w65,1578411614.0,"I do agree that people just jump to using psychology degrees for becoming a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist. I’m thinking of going for a B.A. instead of a B.S. I am more interested in exploring the applications of psychology in different fields instead of strict medical use.

It doesnt have to be a super humiliating text, just a “hey last night was fun!” maybe add “we should do it again sometime”. See where it goes. The connection should continue over text."
PapaJohns,f8bo1qv,t1_f8ancuj,1574441370.0,"Yeah, I think you should probably bring it up and at least ask what’s up with it. That kinda sucks because tips feed me lunch every day"
PapaJohns,f8an1td,t3_dzw1m9,1574402719.0,"OP the phrasing of this is kind of confusing but Yes in stores do get tips from carryouts. At my store we split it among all of the instores working but at other places the person who takes the order can keep it, or sometimes if the manager in charge is signed in on a till then they’ll keep it. Drivers wouldnt share tips with you or anything but specifically carryout orders - yes you should be earning tips."
