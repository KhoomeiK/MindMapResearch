EatingDisorders,fnv0bj9,t3_g3xvzu,1587276170.0,"Yes, I experienced this.... but in my case it was actually a food intolerance (gluten). Since I wasn’t eating/actually digesting anything containing the food I was sensitive too, the effects weren’t noticeable. When I recovered, however, they became very obvious and it took me almost 2 years of struggling through a mishmash of symptoms before I figured it out. The symptoms I had were severe muscle aches/pains/spasms especially in my neck, hives, severe fatigue, migraines, bloating, moments of complete mental instability (this is common in cases of gluten intolerance from what I’ve read, some people with celiac become schizophrenic from gluten), joint/bone pain, nerve pain, blurry vision, etc. I’m sure it’s different for everyone but I’d look into seeing someone to make sure you don’t have a gluten intolerance. A naturopath could probably really help since they deal a lot in those matters and take a holistic approach! 
Please keep in mind that this is only my own experience and that it could be a totally different thing happening entirely! Bodies are SO complicated. If you can, pay attention to when it happens and what you ate/did prior to the occurrence. I’m sorry recovery is a bit of a bumpy ride for you, but you are doing fantastic and I’m proud of you! Keep up the great work!"

When I was sick, no changes I made to my body ever helped me recover. When I realized that making changes to my body would not make me happy it was terrifying. I basically took it as “oh my god, I’ll never be happy with my body”. That is so so so not true. It’s scary to have that awakening moment at first, but then it is really liberating. It becomes less of “I’ll never be happy” and more of “if this won’t make me happy, I need to find something that will”. And THAT’S what recovery is trying to help you find. I know how super hard it is, but if you stick to recovery and trust the process, you will really thank yourself. It’s hard to trust something that feels like it’s totally uprooting your life, but if you can’t trust the process, trust those of us who have gone through it. You CAN do this. Utilize all of the resources that are available to you. There’s some really great books (a lot of folks I know read “life without ED” and said it was fantastic), recovery blogs and vlogs, and this sub is great too from what I’ve seen.

EatingDisorders,fm57zwe,t3_ft5gva,1585768010.0,"This is a tricky thing. I’m not a professional but I was also bulimic for over a decade. Here is what I know... long lasting damage was done to the relationships with people who tried to force me into rehab/recovery. I never had any issues with people who were just supportive of my happiness and wanted to spend time with me even though I was going through something. I always appreciated that. It’s so hard because you want to help them but bulimia does NOT respond to logic. It’s purely emotional and defensive. If she feels that you’re a threat to something that she relies so heavily on, she may try to push you away. Again, I can’t say that for sure, I’m speaking from my own experience. 

My counselors always told my mom to not try to stop me or “call me out” when I purged/restricted because I would push her away for it. They were right, as far as I could tell.
People with eating disorders NEED people to support and love them, but if those people get too directly involved it could cause them to isolate. Which is exactly what I did. 

I’m so sorry your sister is dealing with this and I’m sorry that YOU are dealing with this. It’s not easy when it is someone you love. She will learn her worth and learn to love herself in recovery, but she has to be ready to embrace recovery. Here is how I would show support to her:
1) see if you notice if she has any “safe” foods, or foods that she enjoys and doesn’t try to purge. If she does, perhaps when you two spend time together or go out to lunch, you can focus on the safe foods and eat those WITH her. For example, if she’ll eat fruits you could go out for organic smoothies. If she is ok with having salads or soup, go with her for salad or soup. It might seem like you’d want to make her eat something with more substance, but it is not your job to fix the bulimia. Safe foods are better than no food or “trigger foods” or feeling excluded from social gatherings. 
2) when I was bulimic I stopped doing the things I loved like walking in the woods and painting. If she’s doing this, maybe you could try to get her out to do something that she loves. 
3) if it’s becoming an unsanitary situation, you should definitely say something like “hey do you think you’d be able to clean the toilet later?” Or “the trash really smells, would you take it out?” My dad used to approach it in that way, he’d say like “I have to live here too so it’s not fair for you to leave such a mess”. You DO need to live in a healthy environment for you too. You live together so she is responsible for doing her part. That said, sometimes asking if she needs help or counseling is unavoidable. If it gets too out of hand, you shouldn’t hesitate to move out or distance yourself if that’s what you need to do for your own mental health. You matter too. I am so impressed with how you seem to be handling this. You seem very understanding and compassionate and you care about your sister’s wellbeing; but this is not your battle to fight, so take care of you too. 

These are just ideas..... not every person with bulimia is the same, but addiction and eating disorders can be pretty predictable most of the time. I really hope this helps some! You’re a saint of a sister!"

Don’t ask me to elaborate further than that because I kind of need to read more about that to understand how exactly they’re so different, but I felt sort of relieved hearing that.

EatingDisorders,flk07el,t3_fpb20v,1585231059.0,"Firstly, so proud of you for committing to recovery. I hope you know how amazing you are for that. I think we blame ourselves and we are hard on ourselves. Our eating disorders were not our fault and they traumatized us. My body shape changed too and I have scars from self harm. When I began recovery I hated those things about myself. I had a lot of regret and shame, especially about the scars. I looked back and thought, was that necessary? But you know that mental illness takes total control. At that point, YOU didn’t have a say in how you treated your body because your ED was driving the car. That said, your body shape is not what is important. No “goal weight” ever made me happy, no body shape ever made me happy.... I eventually realized that those things can’t give me happiness. It does feel that way, and even still sometimes I look at myself and wish I looked different in some ways. That may never go away. But since I tackled the self-esteem/self-worth part of recovery (which was the hardest part), most of the time I am actually pretty comfortable in my own skin. I even have a good amount of days where I love the way I look, which would have been a wild concept for me 5 years ago! What finally started to give me my confidence back was doing things that challenged me and things that I thought I “couldn’t”, like going back to school or learning how to paint. I’m sure it’s different for everybody but what I am trying to say is that what finally helped me was looking away from what was in the mirror and trying to focus my energy on my inner personal growth. Deleting social media and reading books, saying “I don’t care what my eyebrows look like today, I’m going to go to a painting class” (things that were REALLY HARD for me at first), that’s what helped me. Maybe trying something new and fun that you have dreamed of for a long time would help you. It doesn’t have to be school or painting, it can be planting flowers, learning a martial art, making diy crafts with recycled materials, putting together scale model airplanes, weaving baskets, literally whatever you want. I hope that maybe helps a little.... that’s just sharing my own perspective, I’m sure you’ll hear different things from everyone and that’s the great thing about communities like this is hearing everyone’s input and finding what works best for you personally :) good luck!"

This really gave me some helpful ideas on how to combat some of those thoughts. I also feel like it nicely reinforced some of the really amazing advice regarding judgement and ego in the book I am reading “The Way to Freedom” by the Dalai Lama (highly recommend). To summarize like 6 pages of pure wisdom on the matter, what he basically said in the book was that not only are we quick to judge and evaluate others based on what we believe to be right and good, which is unfair to them, but also we hurt ourselves by doing this because we are closing ourselves off to possible invaluable spiritual learning experiences. 

For me, personally, I think one of my biggest weaknesses comes from people unintentionally feeding my ego and praising me for the career path that I’ve chosen. (Engineering- Which I chose only because it is the one and only thing that I think I would love to do). And I think after a while it started to go to my head. I definitely get some kind of kick out of telling people I’m studying engineering and watching their reaction, which is usually like “wow you must be super smart”. And truthfully- I’m not any smarter than anyone else I actually struggle so much with algebra it’s embarrassing. 

Anyway, I never really considered that I actively SEEK that validation from others when I flaunt the engineering thing. I mean it’s human to want to be validated, but I don’t like that it comes from a place of status-hunger. 

I think that action of asking someone what they are studying or what their career is with the intent of judging them on a scale that you create based on your own ideas about success, is harmful to your interactions with others. You are almost unconsciously deciding, depending on their answer, how much respect you ought to show them. And it’s also harmful to you, since you are automatically comparing yourself to this person. 

I wonder how we could all change how we think about/respond to/ask questions like that so that it doesn’t come from a place of judgement or status-hunger; but from a place of caring and support for each other. I guess just being consciously aware of your thoughts and feelings when that happens and making sure you’re keeping your ego in check. Also- honesty with yourself and the people that you interact with. Instead of just eating it up when people say “wow you’re smart”, it might be better to tell them the TRUTH which is that you really don’t need to be “smarter” than anyone else to pursue a career in STEM. I failed algebra over and over again for years and I’m in calculus now so if I can do it, I believe that anyone can if that’s what they want. 

Anyway, I thought I would share that in the spirit of open honesty and discussion :)"

Paleo,filkhsb,t3_f8imr3,1582503705.0,"
I try not to eat too much sugar but every so often you have to have a treat. My 6 year old and I made paleo cinnamon buns today and I am not crazy about the texture almond flour in baked goods so was half expecting them to taste gross, but they tasted like a cinnamon bun and were totally delicious. Love teaching my daughter that food can still taste amazing without artificial and inflammatory ingredients [link here](https://paleogrubs.com/cinnamon-roll-recipe)"

happy,fg8jmuk,t3_evxkjx,1580621571.0,Omg it gets better and better trust me. I remember hating food and hating eating and now I am teaching myself how to cook and bake for fun! Sounds like you’re right on track to freedom and a wonderful full life. So so proud of you!
happy,fg8ipk1,t3_ewyjlc,1580620725.0,"Omg omg it keeps getting better and better, doesn’t it? Recovery is awesome. There’s nothing like the gratitude of having your life back and the opportunity to re-discover the things you love about life. GO YOU!!!"
motivation,fg8cl47,t1_fg7vdyr,1580615569.0,"Yeah I 100% agree with this^. I have major fatigue issues and the best way that I’ve found to deal with them is by cleaning up my diet, especially eating non-inflammatory foods that are nutrient rich and easily digested. For me I have some intolerances that worsen my fatigue and also give me headaches/joint pain so I eat mostly paleo and it works great for me! 

Another way is to add more exercise into your day somehow. I know as a student that can be tough. Lastly I’d say look into the supplement “cordyceps”. It’s a mushroom extract that I recommend to a lot of customers at work for fatigue and low energy. (I work at a natural supplement shop)"

EngineeringStudents,fensntl,t1_feng06k,1579290114.0,"Couldn’t have said it better myself. And in case you didn’t hear, (screaming) GO TO OFFICE HOURS! :) and do stick to a consistent routine. Example: If you know you need to watch tv to decompress, planning it into your routine to be able to watch 1 episode of a show is way better than binging Netflix all weekend, not touching your homework, and then pulling 3 all nighters and burning yourself out. That’s how migraines are born. 

The only thing I think I’d add is buddy up with other people in class who want to succeed and meet them in the library to go over homework and study guides. I don’t know how I would have gotten through chem if it weren’t for all of the phone numbers I had collected from classmates."

Cooking,fctb20c,t3_eis3td,1577937753.0,Buy your spices from the bulk herbs and spices section at a natural food store or spice specialty shop!! I just bring my empty jars and fill them and I get good quality organic spices for SUPER cheap
Cooking,fclzgmg,t3_ehmfl9,1577760286.0,"Omg yes. People who love mushrooms LOVE mushrooms. Having a “mushroom man” or someone who knows how to harvest them or grows them organically is handy. You can also buy logs that have been pre-infused (for lack of a better term) with mushrooms and you take them home and water them and you’ll have your own mushrooms. 
I have gotten into taking them supplementally as well... cordyceps is great for energy during the day."
