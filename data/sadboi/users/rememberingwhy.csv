I have a few “rotating” or “safe” numbers, but even that can vary. Since I do compulsions to feel a semblance of safety (as I believe most sufferers do), the situation varies, and sometimes I need to do a specific compulsion twice but in two minutes do the exact same one fourteen times even if I’m repeating the seemingly same task I did minutes ago, as circumstances have inevitably changed (i.e. the time, the room, my thoughts/feelings, other external and internal stimili, etc.). OCD - like so many other mental illnesses - is just so all over-the-place. That’s why people can be totally messy and yet perfectionistic with cleaning - they avoid doing it because they don’t want it to be messy and imperfect. Nothing makes sense.

It’s also so hard because I have had a severe ED for years (in recovery now but struggling still) and developed severe reflux and debilitating stomach issues (potentially gatrisis/gastroparesis, which I need further testing for and am awaiting) because of it. I’m ashamed that I’ve abused my body to the point of where it is now (not even including the osteoporosis I suffer with, etc.) and I HATE talking to new doctors even though I am so lucky to have access to them because it’s so complicated. I do still have a severe ED - but now also all this medical stuff that doesn’t go away like it used to with proper nutrition. I feel so ashamed, hopeless, and stupid about it all, so it’s easier just to pretend it’s one or the other when in reality, it’s both (and tends to be for a lot of long-term ED sufferers) and I need to come to terms with it in order to not only heal and help myself but also help others, too.

illnessfakers,f9fja16,t1_f9f4zu3,1575274338.0,"Wrote a post on this a while back. Should be on my profile page if it helps. Basically: EDs are way harder to impose involuntary treatment on than other mental illnesses, as it is hard to define what is “stable” or “not stable”. Inherently all EDs are unsafe behaviors, and the person is risking their life. So no matter what your labs or vitals say, it’s hard to decide when someone needs to be committed to a hospital setting. Also ED patients are notoriously sneaky and lie in order to keep their disorders, so it can be unclear how serious the situation is, or if they are going to be non-compliant post-discharge, if they are actually in therapy as they may say, etc.

Legally, it causes even more of an uproar than a more standard inpatient psych admission because is brings up the age-old question of who are we, as a society, to make anyone do anything? Such as to force someone to eat (or not eat, not vomit, etc.)? It’s a slow form of suicide, unlike someone waving around a gun. It’s much harder to impliment for that reason. 

Lastly, ED wards are not always unvoluntary, which means they don’t always take court-ordered cases (if the person has a court-appointed guardian, however, that can be different). 

Unfortunately so many people don’t take care of themselves all the time (obviously, an ED or other mental health issue is more intense than just a bad habit, though). It’s really hard to legally dismantle all the ethics, rights and needs of the patient, and red tape of the system in figuring out who needs and can access involuntary care."
