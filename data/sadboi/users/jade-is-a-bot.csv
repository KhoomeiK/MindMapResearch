Anxiety,fq1yq0j,t1_fq1w4rd,1589051243.0,Hi! Please be careful. [drugs.com](https://drugs.com) says the following about Zoloft and Ibuprofen: Using sertraline together with ibuprofen may increase the risk of bleeding. The interaction may be more likely if you are elderly or have kidney or liver disease.

antidepressants,fpr6oid,t3_gf2dhr,1588844365.0,hi! im from the netherlands too but my situation was a bit different. i went to my GP and got redirected to a psychologist. after 12 appointments my psychologist told me it was time to start antidepressants (even though i wanted them already a few months ago). she said if i just asked her she would call my GP about it and let her prescribe them. i hope this is helpful

ac_newhorizons,fk2p3j7,t1_fk1pf9t,1583805911.0,"do u guys think that pears are financially the best native fruit? because i dont want them. however, couldnt i get the other fruits as trees by getting them from other islands? basically i want to get rid of all my pear trees (except for a few maybe) and get all the other fruits because theyre worth more bells on my island?"
coolguides,fj9y273,t1_fj9xgc3,1583162268.0,"i agree with you to a certain extent. i think yes all science changes and evolves. but for now we have to accept the current knowledge. but getting back to the point, why do you think that anxiety attacks are worse than panic attacks? and what does that bring knowing that anxiety attacks are worse than panic attacks? for me panic attacks feel like i’m going to die and i do not like the fact that you’re belittling the severeness of panic attacks."
coolguides,fj9wbwj,t1_fj9vnm8,1583161133.0,"just because homosexuality was in the dsm doesn’t mean that people are saying that is not okay to be a homosexual. because technically, it is a deviation in the brain since most people are heterosexual. but just because you have that deviation, that doesn’t mean you are not a ‘normal’ human. it is totally fine if you’re a homosexual. i think the distress homosexuality causes to people could also be considered a mental illness, but homosexuality itself isn’t. mental illness is not a bad thing. anyways, i believe there has been enough research conducted on GAD and panic disorder for the dsm to be correct. so many people suffer from it. it’s easy to collect information."
coolguides,fj9vjv7,t1_fj9usx4,1583160614.0,"you didn’t but i’m implying that you are the clueless one as you think that anxiety attacks are worse than panic attacks. it is not in the dsm-v, thus it is not a recognisable symptom of a mental disorder, meaning it is not as severe as panic attacks. i have both GAD and panic disorder diagnosed by the way."
coolguides,fj9upqe,t1_fj9slaz,1583160055.0,an ‘anxiety attack’ is not a term recognised by the DSM-5. in this case an ‘anxiety attack’ is more so describing GAD.
