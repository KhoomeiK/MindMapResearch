AskReddit,fj35ayu,t1_fj355ax,1582968011.0,Ah yes now that's a good one. Like how asbestos was used for a lot of purposes in 19th century before we became aware of its toxicity. Making early chemists aware of its toxicity would've greatly benefited society.
AskReddit,fj34hvx,t1_fj346kt,1582966825.0,Trotskyist Soviet Union. So a world where his wet dream of permanent revolution occurs. I guess this would result in a quick WW3 where the allies go to war with Trotsky because of his expansionist/world revolution ideology. Pretty dope scenario.
AskReddit,fj34b4b,t1_fj33ytz,1582966557.0,"Interesting scenario. So the United States and the rest of the world never have a cold war, allowing America to reach global superpower status without any obstruction. Maybe a 21st century where America essentially controls the world? Or what if the absence of the Soviet Union let's Great Britain and France hold on to their superpower status? The possibilities are endless tbh."

But I go on forward with only one goal in mind, too visit each and every country in this big, beautiful, ever expansive world. This world has so much to offer, there's so much to see, and I don't wanna die without seeing at least a fraction of it. I love humanity. I love the thousands of different and mysterious cultures of this world. The most beautiful thing about being alive is to be able to experience the wonders of this world."

AskReddit,f2jng3u,t3_ddh8vm,1570275037.0,"I remember back when I was a 4 year old kid living with my mom in India when one night I saw something moving on the other side of the window at night. Theres a water collection duct thingy on the other side and it looked like a small man with a large head walked past the window on the drain, and momentarily looked at me. Fast forward a few days, around midnight, I suddenly woke up to a deep voice chanting in some illegible language very loudly. I remember shouting at it to stop and trying to wake my sleeping mother but to move avail. My mother has no recollection of any these events and thinking about it still puzzles me to this day. 

And ik the first part might've just been leaves of a nearby tree or something but the way it moved was so smooth and humanlike I find it hard to believe it was just some leaves swaying in the wind. And the 2nd part,oh so creepy and bizarre, might've been sleep paralysis but I clearly remember moving around the room trying to wake my mother and going back to sleep teary eyed and afraid."
