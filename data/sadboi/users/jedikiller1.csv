Although you're right I think you can get by in MA104 more easily if you just spend more time practicing. But you could say that about any math course. Any math course you can get a 12 if you either practice a lot or just really understand the content or both. I find that if you enjoy the class and content, it's easier to do well in the class too!"

I think MA122 was actually easier this term because it went online and it was Santoprete too. But yeah I can imagine the switch to online for MA121 would be rough. I'm really glad I did that in the fall like it was hard enough already in-class but I can imagine learning proofs online is just terrible."

I mean look back in history and even today! Indigenous people, atheists, and others are savages that need enlightenment /s

But seriously, obviously I disagree with superstition but we’d be no better than the religious people of the past (and today too I suppose) if we decide to use force against some group of people for not having the same beliefs as us. I know there are extremists in most, if not all religions and we shouldn’t tolerate their extreme beliefs. But we can coexist with the more reasonable religious people. Show love not hate or fear towards these people. If we can show that atheism is non-violent, peaceful and loving then we can show that we’re only human and we can support each other rather than divide each other. And that we don’t need a god or gods for morality or happiness because we’ll have each other instead. We can share our beliefs with others and show them rather than forcing ours or having others force their beliefs onto us. But in the end, it doesn’t matter what we believe in because we’re all human and as long as other’s beliefs don’t infringe on our rights and we don’t infringe other’s rights then we won’t have any problems.

TLDR just believe what you want to believe in (as long as it doesn’t harm anyone or their rights) but don’t force it on other people
