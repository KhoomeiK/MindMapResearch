BPD,ezi6zkj,t1_ez96ttk,1567922260.0,"Thanks for this thought out reply, it was very nice and helpful. I didn’t think to fill the void for some reason, I figured i would just have to get used to it. Unfortunately I’ve been drinking a bit before bed a couple nights out of this week but it’s been making me feel like shit so I’m not doing that anymore. I really need to get into DBT, It’ll just affect my work hours and I may get scheduled less. Also for some reason with my health insurance its such a process to get into the DBT program. There’s like a waiting list and shit so I’ve been kinda discouraged. I have the workbook, I just need to open it up and actually read it I guess! Thank you"
BPD,ezi68nr,t3_d0dgq5,1567921919.0,"I’m responding late to these replies because I was too frustrated to come up with any sort of response at the time. This really helped me in the moment though and was mainly why I didn’t smoke that night! That’s great that you’re giving sobriety a try, I’ve been sober about 1 week now. I used to smoke a few bowls a night as well as take a 10mg edible, sometimes 2. On my days off I’d be extremely high all day so that actually makes sense that it’s withdrawal symptoms. I’ve felt so anxious and down more so than usual, I’m glad to hear it should wear off though. I’d like to be able to smoke every once in a while on my days off at some point but for now I’m gonna keep going with sobriety and see how I feel. Thank you!!"

BPD,ez8sa9a,t3_d0dh13,1567756710.0,I had such a huge problem with this that it was making me angry and paranoid constantly thinking about the people I would stalk. I deleted my social media where I was doing it the most and I’ve slowly been feeling better. I was sad at first because I missed the other parts of it but the stalking and feeling awful really outweighed the rest. It took some convincing from my therapist and it didn’t make the bad thoughts stop right away but it’s getting quieter with time I’ve noticed.
BPD,ez8rx3s,t3_d02cll,1567756149.0,"It makes my blood boil, it makes me want to be violent and cuss them out honestly lol"
BPD,ez8rrzl,t3_czzi18,1567755933.0,"I have done this for a long time. I feel like I’m trying on different things and trying to see what sticks and feels like “me”. Then I just get frustrated because at the end of the day nothing sticks and I don’t know who I am still. It’s exhausting! I think a lot about how it makes me look to other people. I’m so self conscious that everyone knows I’m a phony and they remember 6 months ago when I was pretending to be someone else, or a year ago when i was a completely different person and they notice how consistently inconsistent and weird I am. I hate it"
BPD,eykfo3q,t3_cwytkx,1567149169.0,"I’ve been feeling like this off and on for so long and couldn’t figure out how to put it into words. It really doesn’t feel like me when I’m messing everything up, it’s like a switch is flipped and I’m like “ughhh okay I guess I’m this person again for now” and the real me is trying to hard to peak through but I’m shoved so deep down inside myself and not in control. I have no idea how I’m going to react to things when I’m like that"
BPD,exxuttv,t1_exxmb4t,1566642962.0,"that’s kinda how I feel, like i was able to be so positive and light then all of a sudden I don’t feel as empathetic and I’m mad at anyone who inconveniences me because i’m trying to maintain my good feeling and they’re ruining it for me, like i just become rotten"
BPD,exxr9cq,t3_cudabn,1566641257.0,i can’t even comprehend being able to have this reaction lol
BPD,exxqpk9,t3_cun0el,1566640976.0,yes and i feel hecka bad because i don’t think to maintain the relationships when we’re not face to face. I don’t really feel bad about it when im doing it but when I see them again I feel guilty for not knowing about stuff going on with them or not responding to them or whatever. to be honest i just don’t care if they are not one of my weekly people I see! i have to remember why i like them and then I care again
BPD,exs7as7,t3_cu8cd7,1566534571.0," my bf will hold me and pet my head when i’m hyperventilating and crying. he’ll say “everything is okay, nothing has changed, i love you, we’re not breaking up” stuff like that because he knows that’s usually the root of why i’m upset about something seemingly silly or very minor. i think if you can pinpoint exactly what you typically get upset about and have him repeat back to you that it’s false it could help! if there is anything specific anyways, I know sometimes for me it’s just random bad feelings but him doing that for me has helped us to not argue every time I get un-proportionally upset about things. it’s been very reassuring and i am a lot less paranoid and suspicious of him wanting to leave me"
