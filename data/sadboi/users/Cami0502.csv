abusiveparents,fbiqwiy,t3_edkc5v,1576910344.0,"I really get this, it hit the spot for me. I feel the same way. Now that I got my distance from them on a daily basis, I now see how draining they were to me and how much negative energy there is in that house. I was so lucky that I moved close to my grandparents and aunt and uncle and they really take care of me like Iâ€™ve been living 15 minute drive away from them my whole life. Iâ€™m going home today for the holidays so Iâ€™ll be home the next two weeks, luckily for me I have a boyfriend that Iâ€™m staying with while home. I hope you make it through the holidays alright. Just remember that itâ€™s okay to take a breather once in a while when things are about to get too much."

bulletjournal,f9kzzlr,t3_e5lcxa,1575411368.0,"Amazing idea. Iâ€™m kind of doing the same for both my friend and my boyfriend.

Today I picked up my friends bujo and made the yearly spreads that weâ€™ve been talking about that I should make for her. Itâ€™s gonna be pretty great when Iâ€™m finished and she can use it. 

Lately Iâ€™ve also been talking to my boyfriend about making one for him as we both think that he could benefit from it on the long run. Iâ€™m planning to give him the supplies as part of his Christmas gift so that I can set it up while home on break until mid January (long distance relationship)

Iâ€™m quite excited for both these projects as Iâ€™m a very big people pleaser and love to do things for others."

abusiverelationships,ezt72xc,t3_d1rhub,1568123084.0,"Oh wow, this really hit me. This is such a good description of my ex.
It took several other people, including the guy who is now my boyfriend, to see the hell that Iâ€™ve been through the past 1,5 years, and telling me that it was hell because I hadnâ€™t noticed it was as bad as I were because I was used to it"
abusiverelationships,ez9350h,t3_d0dcn3,1567771469.0,"I have been in a mentally abusive (with a very little sexual abuse) relationship for a year and it continued half a yeah after we broke up because we went to the same school. For me it took to meet the right person, my boyfriend. In the beginning he couldnâ€™t even touch me in the slightest sexual way without me getting an anxiety attack and I was so scared to open up and be myself around him, but he waited for me. He has been by my side all along, taking care of me, protecting me and holding me the whole way through it. Specific situations and stuff still makes my cry and go through bad situations in my head, but then my boyfriend is right there with his loving eyes and hugs. My best advice would be to have a person who knows what youâ€™ve been through that you can talk open and honest with, who can care for you and help you through the though times. One day youâ€™ll find a person who help you to be able to trust again, Iâ€™m sure of it"
