Edit: checked your profile and you seem to have a 5700 xt (like me). You can fix those crashes by downloading this DirectX to vulkan translation layer (https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk) and placing the d3d9.dll file (from the x64 folder) in the same folder as the main executable (""LOST ARK/Binaries/Win64"").
