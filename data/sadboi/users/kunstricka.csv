Passin it talking shit but only if your ass
In front of me cause you could run from me but
In the end revenge send ends to the defendant
I can’t get get caught in the spiral cause every bit of energy

I suddenly understood why I, through the years, get annoyed in there debate oriented conversations. Language, I realized, is a formula. We are trying to get somewhere with it.

It could be my subconscious mind worrying about this with the virus, or maybe my unconscious tapped into our shared information. I did some online searching and came across Muslim “re-education” camps in China which is frightening, and also my initial thought when I woke up was it was to “eliminate” the virus by murdering people.

C_S_T,fngcajd,t1_fnextt8,1586927941.0,"Agree and had a similar thought. Tacking onto your statement a few other things:

Education - Why do we send our children away for 13 years to sit at a desk all day to be lectured? Why didn’t I learn about all of the possible occupations I could have? Why don’t I have essential life skills that were previously passed down through generations such as gardening, canning, carpentry? Why are my loans taking decades to repay?

New types of schooling, apprenticeships, generational knowledge, essential life skills. Free education. 

Livelihood - Why am I a slave for 40 hours in a factory or high-rise? To then pay the banks for the loans I took for my education and home? To make the rich richer? What a system. 

No more outrageous loans handcuffing us all for an eternity. Education and information should be free. Housing should be affordable and a human right. 

Consumerism & Makers & Sustainability - Why are we addicted to convenience and materialism? Why do I use so many disposable products? Why did we think industrialism is good? Why do I buy from a corporation and not the makers? 

Return to simpler way of living. Buying products from the makers. 

Housing - Why do banks and landlords own our homes? Why dont we know how to build our own structures? Why are prices so inflated? Why isn’t land/space a God given right?

Not sure the answer to this. 

Agriculture/Food - Why do I buy produce from a corporation that can be freely grown in my yard? Why don’t I buy direct from a farmer and not a corporation? Why don’t I buy direct for anything?

Farmers markets. Direct to consumer. Gardening. 

Mental Health - Why do we like being busy? The excitement or a destraction from what is bothering us at the core? Our dissatisfaction that we spend 40 hours a week to make profits for a corporation? Deadlines. Profits. Overtime. Stressed to the max. Drowning myself in alcohol and Netflix. 

Slow down. Culture and personal mind shift to what is important. Health. Family. Peace. Escaping this race we all have been participating in. Stop doing and start be-ing."
