I've addressed what you have said but you are ignoring the fact that the risk factor goes up in regards to a potential sexual assault. This is a fact and I'm sorry that yo cant understand that. There isnt going to be cameras everytime and people around everytime.  I was in a situation like this that exposed me to a risk that wouldn't have existed if there was segregated bathrooms. I dont get how you cant understand that. I'm telling you from first hand experience. I'm an experienced insurance underwriter and I can tell you that the risk of a sexual assault and accusations from a sexual assault go up in this situation...cameras arent going to save anyone..if they are even in the bathroom....I'm done with this convo you are ridiculously unreasonable and are just looking to argue.

This risk wouldn't have existed if i was in a men's only bathroom and she was in a female only bathroom. My reasoning is not lacking one bit.

In this day and age where people are forced to have to ""beleive"" women, it's not very prudent to demand men put themselves in this type of situation. So it's not a win-win. You have to keep in the forefront of your mind that these genderless bathrooms are only to accommodate trans people and other non sis gendered people, no one else. Sis gendered people are forced to accept this for fear of being labeled hateful and non inclusive.

Dont get me wrong, it could go both way. Let's face it, there are different genders and as it stands people are more comfortable doing their business with their own gender. The problem arises from trans and other non sis gender people and how we can be inclusive. How about gendered bathrooms and non gendered bathrooms as a compromise??? I personally feel very uncomfortable sharing a bathroom with a non male for the above stated reason and for other reason yet my rights and standards are being compromised. That right there isnt fair.

I don't want women in my bathroom simply out of fear that a deranged women will accuse me of sexual assault. And I guarantee that most women dont want some smell hairy guys nuts dangling around in their bathroom while they are squattin. All these gender neutral bathrooms are for a very minor part of the population and the burden should be on them to have to adjust and feel uncomfortable for a tiny fraction of their day.

Part of that process is reducing carbon output from fossil fuels, and developing renewable technologies that will be able to efficiently handle the energy demand. Power from fossil fuels is required to develop these technologies and build out renewable infrastructure. To think we can just flip a switch to renewable sources overnight is unrealistic and naive. There are practicalities and logistics that are involved that will take decades to implement. For better or worse we are stuck with fossil fuels until the gradual shift is complete.
