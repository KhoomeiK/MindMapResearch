mentalhealth,fly592o,t3_frlqsc,1585595776.0,I think it’s completely normal what you explained and if anything could work to your advantage. My advice would be put down the phone and get rid of social media for a bit whenever you feel you are ready. I got rid of it a while back for like 2 months and man was that the happiest and more clear minded I have ever been.
mentalhealth,flviapm,t3_fr7yy8,1585524416.0,LOVE YOU TOO ✌🏼🦋*++
mentalhealth,fltwfog,t3_fr3hp9,1585489249.0,I been to iop meetings and from what I learned is that an event could’ve been traumatic for you but not for someone else. So basically trauma comes in many forms so you shouldn’t be afraid to label things if they really bother you. If you can’t cope with it than it’s trauma
mentalhealth,flsgeye,t3_fqsxmh,1585441540.0,Have you ever had a issue with pornography? also finding new distractions might help i’ve felt empty before and sometimes it still hits me but not as bad. Hope this helped 🦋🦋
mentalhealth,flo6kpi,t3_fplncz,1585332538.0,Yes but i’ve always had a gut feeling that once I did start accomplishing things I would surpass many. Kinda like high risk high reward just know it takes time but never compare.
mentalhealth,fl7n94y,t3_fn185h,1584905264.0,maybe a personality disorder and could just be a temporary feeling bc i’ve felt numb in the past and sometimes I still do. Hope things get better for you man 💯🦋
trees,fky7qsn,t1_fky7gxm,1584643302.0,damn bro i’m sorry to hear this but make sure you smoke that i’m sure it would make him happy.
NoFap,fjn4k51,t3_fe8f21,1583497662.0,congrats dude !! similar situation happened to me recently except the anxiety was there 😔 but we 5 days clean from pmo
NoFap,fh0oqh0,t3_f0sovo,1581206017.0,dope af this is what it’s about 💯
fakecartridges,fgfq4t1,t1_fg5v1vi,1580745084.0,lmao aha yeah can’t do somebody else wrong that karma would come back at me
fakecartridges,fgfq2h5,t1_fg6f9fg,1580745042.0,i’m 19 lol and currently smoking on something from the dispensary
fakecartridges,fgfps3e,t1_fg7lupe,1580744855.0,I still have it but I am now smoking a cart from the dispensary no more worries when it comes to my health and it gets me a good high 😝
fakecartridges,fg5uvxu,t1_fg5u4d1,1580539849.0,yeah I took 1 hit and got me blown but ima just flip it and get some from the shop can’t risk it
fakecartridges,fg5is98,t1_fg5i6vg,1580528612.0,Yeah you right just sucks cause I don’t have full access to clubs or dispensaries. Not to mention everything is fake now n days
fakecartridges,fg5i5vi,t1_fg5h8l8,1580528126.0,Probably going to just take 1 hit and see how I feel I don’t wanna die
fakecartridges,fg5gqje,t1_fg5glak,1580527019.0,this didn’t help. I’m assuming you fuck with these then?
trees,ffgkufo,t1_ffgg0bb,1579908554.0,Yeah i’ve heard that as well and it’s seems to work for me. Edibles are more reliable for me bc of my parents I don’t have time to store weed and roll etc. Dont get me wrong I love smoking too tho 💯
trees,ffgcju4,t1_ffgc4yi,1579903225.0,"Yeah I feel like that too I found what works best for me is eating a meal 40-1hr before you take the edible. I knocked out last night, never fail to get a goodnight sleep on an edible. 😅"
trees,ffgccal,t1_ffgbz6j,1579903097.0,ya dig
trees,ffgb3uf,t1_ffgaifa,1579902343.0,"lol yeah I don’t really smoke just edibles, for sure getting ripped later tonight tho 😈"

Semenretention,f9meugy,t3_e5ni1i,1575455317.0,Dang this got put on London Real finally this topic is being pushed on bigger platforms. 💯
Semenretention,f9jdtjq,t3_e5blnw,1575369304.0,"Ignore the hate comments, noticing things in others that you used to see in yourself isn’t a crime lol. I hope you don’t bash anyone at least from my pov it’s not anger it’s being passionate. You hate to see other guys be in that position you were once in or still are in."
NoFap,f8f62w4,t3_e0hcup,1574538855.0,"I agree nofap is the start to self improvement. I also think that you have the right to have your own reason so if you started for sex, confidence, etc that’s okay. At the end of the day you started for a particular reason, if that gets you through the journey then I don’t see a problem. I do hope that everyone on nofap or semen retention at least come to a realization that nofap is bigger than all that."
motivation,f6n7ifd,t1_f6mpe98,1572986123.0,This quote doesn’t apply to that cause nutting darins your energy 💯
mentalhealth,f6k47uw,t3_drm49z,1572904651.0,Not weird at all the cold as hella benefits.
mentalhealth,f6fuxhc,t1_f6fqsw1,1572818339.0,Oh okay I see thanks for letting me know I’ll see how it goes.
NoFap,f6fhbmv,t3_dqxmpc,1572814368.0,"dude yes this is facts. Every time I relapse it’s because I lost sight of why I started. Whenever I went on long streaks my mind was always thinking about it, like how you said."
mentalhealth,f6fd97c,t3_dr3xc7,1572813087.0,oh no...  I have an appointment on the 13th he better be a good therapist lol.
NoFap,f69y7k7,t3_dqpib2,1572749417.0,"damn and my mind was tricking me to touch my self tonight cause i’m home alone. Definitely ain’t thinking about that anymore, thanks for sharing."
NoFap,f67g72b,t3_dqedot,1572719336.0,"The problem is majority is lost and look at it as a meme. A lot of people only talk about it to be part of the trend. Meanwhile the woke are changing their lives. Man if they only knew, but oh well that’s what happens when you over consume social media."
NoFap,f5t9wym,t3_dp4jkr,1572453691.0,i’m going to give this show a watch now lol
mentalhealth,f4mbrzc,t3_dkvs10,1571676497.0,patience is the key. I been there and I it’s always on and off with me. I turned it around by just waiting tbh and finding ways to motive myself. Just remember treat it like baby steps you’ll get there wish you the best.
Semenretention,f3hrgvl,t3_dgzoxd,1570927553.0,I felt this 💯
motivation,f30r8mh,t3_df0cgl,1570560651.0,Ask what are the reasons to back that up and than give it to them straight. The person might not want to hear it but at least you are trying to show them the light. For example I would give advice to my friend in a similar situation. He doesn’t like it at times but than as time would go on he would always tell me I was right. You can’t change someone overnight just remember that. When they are ready they will get out of that dark space but you can slowly guide him/her.
NoFap,f288ytm,t3_dch248,1570055533.0,"My opinion would be to keep fighting the urges. I am not as far as you i’m currently on day 25ish almost a month. ( haven’t been keeping track that much) Anyway I never had that problem when using the restroom. Don’t relapse, do you think that will get rid of the problem? My advice would be to go check up with a doctor. If there isn’t any pain & it’s manageable keep going on SR the problem should go away on it’s own."
NoFap,f21z3g3,t3_dbh8z7,1569878722.0,beta males and incels are very similar.
NoFap,f1r2zqu,t3_daknap,1569710480.0,hell yeah and i’ll be at 110 days! WE GOT THIS BOYS AND GIRLS 💯
NoFap,f1npe52,t3_da0b04,1569622745.0,Yes sir you got the right mentality! Most guys would dwell and make that one girl a priority. Keep up the abundance mindset and great things will come.
NoFap,f1cz277,t1_f1cnq49,1569369572.0,"I am starting to work again, being more social, working out. MOST IMPORTANTLY I am focusing on self improvement everyday (even the little things). More things will come as time goes on but I am making the effort."
motivation,f12ewx5,t3_d7mvgi,1569139331.0,lmaooo but this high key is motivational 💯
NoFap,f12epq2,t1_f11t6hh,1569139245.0,Same my stepdad wants me to go to parties and talk to women. He doesn’t understand that first comes self improvement before focusing on women.
NoFap,f0hdp9d,t3_d4vmfp,1568619208.0,Sign me up!
NoFap,f0gxa1t,t3_d4ud3u,1568608162.0,Damn you motivated me even more and i’m 18. Keep up that mentality chosen one.
NoFap,f0gw6rn,t1_f0gt3xc,1568607483.0,Hard to give an exact day because I didn’t track the first couple of days. I am currently 5 days without smoking and around 10 days without pmo. I do plan on posting my progress to hold my self accountable and to help others.
NoFap,f0gpwjy,t1_f0gfrpv,1568603967.0,"Yeah I broke the urge and I plan to do so for about 90-120 days. No weed, no pmo, and no sex at all. I’m going monk mode and focusing on my purpose."
NoFap,f0blwbx,t3_d4d47w,1568528800.0,Same here bro! im going monk mode ya feel me
NoFap,f0blhxm,t3_d4grof,1568528646.0,how so?
NoFap,f0blakw,t3_d4gstf,1568528567.0,The last thing you should be doing is checking if you can get hard or not. Trust me bro I been struggling for 3 years. My advice is to leave it alone and by day 90 you should be good. If not keep it going I got the same problem but thinking about it isn’t good for recovery.
Semenretention,f09a4jr,t3_d48xmo,1568496841.0,"How have you been feeling the past days? Check to see if there has been any mood differences from day 7-10 till now. 

hope this helps"
