AmItheAsshole,fq156dz,t3_ggeoan,1589041891.0,"Definitely NTA! As a baker myself, I can relate to how much effort can go into making desserts look nice. HOURS go into this kind of thing, and for him to just completely disregard that because “it’s a cookie” is really selfish. He knew how much you cared about those specific 6 cookies, and ate them anyway."
toxicparents,fnbzrv5,t3_ftf7db,1586825616.0,"I get that. My life is pretty good and I’m grateful for all the opportunities that I have, but both my mom and stepdad have serious issues. My stepdad has a pretty bad temper and is always yelling and exudes toxic masculinity. He always has to be in charge and thinks that what he says goes and is not up for discussion. And my mom is pretty bitchy and always makes snide comments about us kids and is practically like the mean girl in a movie who hides her insults as “jokes”. She also is always sending us stuff about our grades and it’s annoying because it’s all stuff I already know about or can’t do anything about. And they wonder why I like my dads house better (it’s just me and him there)."

Shittyparents,fmpoiya,t1_fmpejo4,1586284505.0,"In my dream world, that would work, and we have kind of tried that before, but my parents are really stubborn and they don’t let us share our feelings before they start yelling at us. My stepdad is also really against counseling, he always feels like he has to be in charge, so anyone telling him that his behavior is wrong just makes him lash out. How can I get them to calmly listen to us without making our feelings feel invalid?"
Shittyparents,fmpoa55,t1_fmpe8bu,1586284379.0,"I see what you mean. But I just can’t help but feel upset at her. It feels like she isn’t taking into consideration how we feel as kids. Me and my stepsister get along really well and are close, and we always talk about how unhappy they seem to be in marriage. I think they’ve both turned into worse people because of their union, so I agree that she might fear being alone but I don’t understand how that’s better than living like this. As for money, she’s getting her doctorate, so I don’t think she’d be that bad off, but I think she’s just used to her lavish life style that my stepdad gives her and she would be scared to live without these benefits."

I can’t even begin to imagine the pain your going through and I’m so so so sorry that you are feeling this pain. But please just try to reach out to someone, anyone. Tell someone what’s going on. I know someone cares. I know nothing about you, and I want you to know that I care. Your parents suck and yes they deserve to know they suck, but killing yourself is not the way to show them that. It’s almost 1:00am for me and I wrote this paragraph for you because I care. Just please know that."
depression,fm74u95,t3_ftgenr,1585813299.0,I feel this so hard right now. I find it really hard to trust and open up to people so no one really knows how sucky I feel. I’m getting more and more tired of faking my smiles and making up excuses. I just want someone to notice and to care and to just listen to me and tell me that I’m not just a teenager who’s over exaggerating all of her problems.
depression,fm74lka,t3_ftaw42,1585813051.0,"Just turned 17. From the outside, I know everyone sees me as a really happy, smart, successful girl who’s going places, but my family life fucking sucks and no one has a single clue. I’m dying inside and I cry myself to sleep abnormally often. I desperately need someone to talk to but I’m not close enough/am too scared to open up to anyone I know."
depression,fm74a78,t3_fsrdy5,1585812713.0,This is exactly what I feel rn. I keep thinking that I’m not even living life right now and that I haven’t been living it for a while. I feel so restricted and I’m so tired of waiting for a future when things are better. I’ve been thinking of Suicide a lot and what life would be like for those after I left but I know I don’t have the guts to actually harm myself in any way.
depression,fm73xlt,t3_fgnp3a,1585812340.0,Lately I just find myself getting really tired of putting on a smile. I’ll just be out with friends or something and I just suddenly feel really sad and feel like I’m hiding and no one seems to notice.
AskWomen,flyvenr,t3_fqw84e,1585609884.0,"When we were heading out from a restaurant downtown, we passed a homeless man who was selling balloons, and when one of us payed for it, everyone treated the balloon as if it was diseased and like it was the cheese touch. We’re all pretty privileged but I thought my friends were more compassionate than the way they acted. I really didn’t know why they were so disgusted by a something that someone was making to get by."
