Psychonaut,fq6oxnq,t1_fn4vh48,1589135706.0,"Alright, that seems pretty decent. Are you not afraid though of long time exposure and how that may affect you? Such as getting addicted or, I wouldn't know, brain damage or anything (sorry I really am ignorant on what it come to shrooms)

But in fact it is something that I've been considering for my self for some time, at least one or half a dose and see what happens. Many people who do it report as something that really helps them to reset their brains and such, so I'm very very curious to try it.

Also, what sort of shrooms do you use?

How you doing by the way, I'm curious how you dealing with it. Do you still have access with shrooms with the quarantine?"
Psychonaut,fn4n1iy,t3_fyydww,1586644750.0,"I have one question, how long until each time you need to have shrooms again and why do you think you are prone or get back to those depression/anxiety states?"

We can all be chamaleons according to our environment.

Hope this makes you feel better about yourself.

depression,fgdejrz,t3_exo1z5,1580681663.0,"I'm sorry to hear that.. 

I was the same.

But then turned to the complete opposite.

It's also not very good. Slightly liberating, but still shitty. I am oh so fully myself now, but now I complain cause I don't feel as strong or composed as others. People don't like me as much as before now. 

Depression is still here. Life is shit. I'm miserable af. 

Just hope one day I'll be in the middle.

Hope this helps lol

Cheers m8"

The world can be a really shitty place.

And I understand, even if just a little, the feeling you have just described.

And I know how hard it can be not to be able to foresee a positive future.

But even in this shitty world we live in, there's hope to find a little corner were we can fit.

Anything is possible in this world, in this universe. Anything.

So I was hoping this message from the other side of the world could give you a little bit of hope and strength for you to be able to find your corner.

I wish you all the best and good fortune to your travel.

Cause in the end, that's what we are all doing here.

We're traveling. Looking for something we don't really know what it looks like.

We just have to find it.

Good luck my friend :)"

depression,euaytd0,t1_etqg45p,1563635553.0,"You're very welcome :) people suffering with depression and anxiety tend to stigmatize themselves as being weak or having thoughts of that sort, when it is quite the opposite.

It might be one of the toughest things in the world one can deal with, and to be able to live and withstand it every single day, only someone with great resilience and power can go through such a thing.

That's one of the messages I try to scatter to everyone, because I think it is of the most important beliefs one should have while going through all of it. 

Also it is such a simple thing to say and it has such a powerful impact. 

And to, in midst of all of it, you still have the will to want to help other people.

I got say, I admire every single person going through depression or anxiety (both it's the shittest thing alive, I have to say) 

But I'm glad of I could help"

Borderline,eq2p19w,t1_eq2hn00,1559741460.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful reply!

I could see myself in the self fulfilling profecy a few months ago, now I don't want to conclude nothing without trying to gather more information and figure it out with competent doctors.

Your reply reliefs me a bit as I was considering being somewhat normal like everyone else, even despite of what I was diagnosed with and that what I complain about does interfere with my daily life.

In any case, I'm going to try to talk it out with my current psychologist and see what he has to add!

In the future, if I'm still concerned about this, I'll get a second opinion.

Thank you so much!"
Borderline,eq0e90r,t1_eq0ai30,1559683086.0,"Hi, thank you for sharing your situation!

I do have the same inner dialogue, it's like I have to retrain my mind to think the better version of things (which many times it's actually the truth and not the other way around!)

I feel like my brain is confused about everything. Ultimately, I feel like I'm this almost shape-shifting mind/person, projected by what my brain thinks it is most correct at every moment. 

What irritates me the most is not having a sense of continuity. I mean, it's not like I wake up a different person everyday, but it is hard to feel I'm always changing and the way I see things. Also my emotions are constantly pumping and changing, so it is very tiring to deal with this everyday. 

I'm a bit tired of waiting for all this commotion to be over and to feel like I'm whole, one, balanced and happy. Also I wanted to see my ex girlfriend for a long time but haven't done it because I wanted to be well before that and it's very hard and frustrating to deal with this. 

I think I relate with you a bit on long term memory. Many times people talk about situations that happened and I have very little memory about it. However it does seem to be a bit more serious in your case! I do remember many things from the past and how they fit in the time-line. I just forget some situations which sometimes I find odd not to remember about it. 

It's ok! I might not be a big help either but always comforting talking with someone in a similar situation. I can always offer you what I have been learning throughout time in order to deal with all this. 

I got curious about how this has affected your life.

Did it affect your relationships? With your job? Friends? Family?

Do you suffer from depression or anxiety?

Any traumatic events (if you want to talk about it)?

Sorry for so many questions, it's just that I get very curious very easily lol.

Thanks again :)"
