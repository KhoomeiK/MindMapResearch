That was me for a while. It's hard af, dude. It feels awful. You can feel guilty, you can feel sad, you wish there were a better way, and for me, I felt like I *knew* that if I just avoided conflict things would get easier, but they didn't.

I had the fortune (LMAOO, misfortune) of being forced into a situation with a very problematic family member. I tried to ignore them when they were blatantly rude, and they just took my silence as permission to keep going, when I let them know how I felt, then brushed me off. If I was not actively fighting them or walking away from confrontations, *they'd take it as permission*, and it wasn't a choice between *My perspective V Their Perspective* anymore *(maybe they have some deep-seated issues, or there's a misunderstanding, I thought),* it became a decision between *Their Feelings* V *My Self-worth*.

Am I worth fighting for? Do I deserve this? Am I worth less than because they're nice to me? Am I worth less than because they are going through ""something hard""? (A.K.A, I *can* tolerate this, but should I, for my benefit?)

So, when you stand up for yourself, remember that you're making space for yourself in a world where people will un/intentionally push you, and push you, and push you. And you're worth pushing back for :)! It gets easier with practice, promise.

Also, thank you.

If you're bothered by someone/something, take appropriate action to correct the situation (set boundaries, ignore people, kill friendships.)

I think a sense of genuine ease has come over people who have this revelation, so I don't think the facade is necessary.

Hey... take a deep breath. This sense of purposelessness is temporary. Your work was NOT for nothing. You worked your ass off! You studied hard! You are a very hard-working, well-accomplished man and I am proud of you. You did everything right, and the fact this COVID-19 shit happened is. NOT. YOUR. FAULT.

&#x200B;

>I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughly

From the way your post is worded, you see yourself as weak and pathetic ***due to circumstances out of your control***. This is internalization, or the tendency to blame oneself for external circumstances. I'm TELLING you, this is faulty thinking([https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/10-forms-of-cognitive-distortions-faulty-thinking/](https://www.habitsforwellbeing.com/10-forms-of-cognitive-distortions-faulty-thinking/)) and emotions don't always equal your reality.

 This didn't happen because you were a bad person, or even if you deserved this. Your brain blames itself for external circumstances to feel more in control, and it is a trap. Do not fall for this trap, as it is a vicious cycle that will make you feel depressed time and time again.

On top of it all, it seems like your values have fallen apart: education, accomplishment, money, hard-work, even religion... It's understandable why you'd feel like life has nothing to offer you anymore, but I promise that it isn't true. You *can* find a real job, you *can* make money again, find love, and get into the medical field.

Please don't give up. This isn't over yet, and *you* aren't done for. I think you should make a single circle on a piece of paper, and on the inside are things you *can* control, and on the outside, things you *can't.* [This](https://gostrengths.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Whatsinyourcontrol_091312_gostrengths.jpg) is an example. When you've completed your diagram, take all the shit you can control and focus on it as hard as you can because I *promise* there are things in that inner circle.

It isn't over. Please stay. Your life is valuable and precious, and you don't deserve to die. Life has been unfair to you, but I want you to hang on and don't dread the future... but focus on making it *today.* Focus on today. Today is what matters *right now*, and I *know* you're capable to hang on. Maybe even consider reaching out to your parents? Even if you find it hard to care about yourself now, they may remind you how important you are as a person, and as their son.

Good luck, and I'm proud of you for trying so hard. I hope that things start looking up for you. None of what happened is your fault, and don't give up on yourself just yet.

mentalhealth,fm40vc6,t3_fsy3n6,1585743499.0,">I have been going to therapy for a while and it hasn't done anything for me at all. It further just points at things that are wrong with me, that I have already known but I cant fix them worth shit. Don't get the impression that I don't try to fix my problems because I try my absolute hardest. I like my therapist but I have told her what still goes on and it almost seems like she doesn't listen to me or even give me guidance to help me.

First of all, I believe you when you say you're trying. However, the lack of results could be a myriad of *other* things, man. It could be that you don't notice changes within yourself, because it seems like what the attention *is* on is *only* on how ""flaws"" are being brought into the light. The point that stands out to me the most, though, is your therapist.

Consider getting a new one? If you feel she isn't right for you, you aren't obligated to stick it out with her. Therapy is for you, where you recover. And in the hypothetical scenario where any therapist gets openly insulted because you're trying to find someone who helps you embrace a new, happier life, it is probably not right for you anyway.

I say, stop being so hard on yourself, okay? This situation isn't hopeless, *you* aren't hopeless, and I hope you come to believe how capable you really are because I trust that you're trying your damndest. You're going to be okay, and you're going to see this shit through.

I think that the inability to be in touch with one's emotions/emotional numbness, lack of self-esteem and hopelessness are things that I now associate with [brain fog](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog) and [anhedonia](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/anhedonia#causes) (and in extension, symptoms of depression.)

>Another main problem is I don't know how to relax or focus on me, I am constantly putting everyone in front of me. I never do things with the thought of me, I can't do anything that will truly help me relax as for I have really bad buyers remorse and get bored and impatient very easily. 

As for needing advice for where to start, those sound like pretty good places to start for me. If you never put yourself first, practice. If you struggle to do things that make you feel context/relaxed/""happy"", then begin doing those things. If you struggle with committing to hobbies, then try to counter-act that. I know that's a pretty broad suggestion, but I'm sure you're more than capable.

>I'm kinda on my last limb here and I would like guidance on where I should start. I really want to see someone that could diagnose me with whatever I have or am going through. I'm extremely lost and confused about my mental health and every year it seems to get progressively worse. It's also probably gonna be difficult to see someone due to the corona virus.

I do hope that your quality of life improves, as I don't think anyone deserves to be unhappy. I relate to that need for a diagnosis and validation, and I want you to know that you aren't alone, and your feelings *are* completely valid. Please learn to trust yourself, you know yourself more than anyone, and you are not weak for experiencing these feelings. Also, don't despair! Therapists are capable of calling/face-timing, so I'm sure that you can find one in the right place.

Good luck, I hope you find happiness."

writing,fj28a6s,t3_fb47np,1582937053.0,"I'm going to interpret this as a general, ""how do I write?"" question. Well, I'd suggest starting with [Narrative Structure](https://www.authorlearningcenter.com/writing/fiction/w/plot-planning/6366/how-to-structure-a-story-the-fundamentals-of-narrative---article), [types of conflict](https://education.seattlepi.com/types-conflict-can-found-narrative-3739.html), [story archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots), and maybe some [character archetypes.](https://blog.reedsy.com/12-common-character-archetypes-every-writer-should-already-know/) If you feel like you're bad, it's okay. A ""good"" story comes with many, many revisions to the original idea.  Don't feel too overwhelmed and don't get hung up on the details, it's alright if it's not perfect.

Your only job is to shove a writing ""ritual"" into your day-to-day life. If you have about half a month, then make a rough story with characters and plot. Then, you decide ""I will write every day until X date from... say 5 'o clock to 6 'o clock and stick to it no matter it takes. Finish the rough draft, and try not to hung up on how ""bad"" it is. As I always say, perfectionism is the death of art. Seriously, don't let your work stop you from trying or *failing*. ""Failure"" is how we learn.

 If you say it's your class's job to improve the manuscript, then finish the rough draft and let the rest of the class do the work for you in the workshop? Anyhow... good luck. I think you'll do fine as long as you don't let your frustration(?) keep you from trying."

>He doesn’t really need anything to lose per se. If the story is about his adventure and growth as a character, there doesn’t really need to be ‘stakes’ in my opinion as long as the character’s evolution is compelling (though I guess you could argue that him losing his old self is what’s at stake).

I especially appreciate this part. I was worried that my story would be boring and unengaging without stakes, but I'm glad that is not the case. Thank you so much for taking the time to answer, it means a lot.

&#x200B;

As for the sister situation, she is chronically ill, and in need of a lot of care and the MC is anywhere between 12-15 (he's a little naïve and is too desperate/ a little over-emotional to consider the consequences), and the whole running away aspect is just a whim until he bonds with Robin (an adult) and the circus girl. He then plans to shrug his sister onto Robin as he ""escapes"". I haven't completely fleshed out the reasons and characters yet, but I know that he views his sister as an obstacle to his freedom and resents her, even though he does love her on some level.

&#x200B;

>You could emphasize how his new life is chaotic and unstable (if that’s the case) compared to his structured and comfortable life from before (even though he hates it). By running off with the circus, he loses the familiarity of his old life/town/family. Maybe you can add pieces of internal/external dialogue where he thinks the circus thing is only temporary and never plans on committing to that life and just needs a little adventure. Then towards the end, after he’s bonded with his new group, he’s faced with the decision to either stay with his new family and embrace the nomadic lifestyle or return to his old family.

I am kind of jealous that I didn't think of this before, but the idea I've committed to is that the story focuses on his life in his hometown and why his mother died, ect., and ends where he is trying to get onto the train. So, kind of an open-ended conclusion. I like this *a lot,* though, I may integrate this idea somehow.

writing,ffwry7d,t3_eviwfh,1580309572.0,"I think as there is a balance of tension, action, connection and the slowing of the pacing, you will be fine. I personally read for the emotional aspect and to get attached to the characters. If the bleak, self-destructive section of the story is taking a back-seat to flashbacks or exposition (of why the character is like this) then I think I would be interested in reading something like this, if done to *my* liking\*. 

  
I think reading about *why* a character grew up to be the way that they are, while also getting a glimpse (but only a glimpse!), of how they respond to in their modern-day life would be a good set-up to a sequel where the focus is more on the relationship between the MC and the side-MC, and then the rest of the story is dedicated to slowly building up the ""payoff"". So, personally, I think putting it off is fine, as long as it's foreshadowed and built up to and not infringing on anything set up previously (characterization, plot, ect....)

  
 Anyway, I think that it can work, and I generally love stories like these. I like being angry at the character, which means I care about what they do.

  
I would describe this as a very dark drama, and I like those. Things become bleak when bad things happen to good people (not to say that MC didn't have a messed up backstory) and nothing *ever* gets better. THAT'S bleak. I feel like dramas are cathartic because somebody eventually calls out the Problematic Character out, or they get what they deserve or whatever. Knowing that the Problem Character eventually gets what they deserve (good or bad) is what makes a good read for me in this scenario.

(FYI this is a lot of self-disclosure. I don't want to make this about me, but the best way I feel like I can offer help is through my own eyes.)

I've felt lonely before because I felt like nobody cared, and nobody stepped in to do anything when a Toxic Relative(TM) would start talking shit to me about my dead parent and shit. I started to feel like I didn't matter, and I started to internalize that shit because I just couldn't comprehend what I did wrong.I think you feel sad because people keep letting you down, or maybe the people who you want to be close to acting like you are nothing. I find that the energy I used to escape can be used to find healthy *reminders* of the people who DO care about me, like talking to my friends. If you feel comfortable, let them know that you feel hopeless/worthless/unloveable and ask for comfort. Maybe not exactly like that, but adjusting your attention to the people that are worth your time helps A LOT.

For example, my cousin cares about me *so* much. He thinks I'm really cool and is always interested in what I'm up to, so when I feel like nobody cares, I always go to him to show him what I've done. *He* cares. And my best friend, for example, he's always there to tell me that I'm a worthy person and a good friend. 

I feel like if someone gave me this advice, I'd feel a bit jaded because the people who *need* to change AREN'T changing, but understand how they feel about you is out of your control and irrelevant. As I said, try to shift your attention to people who have more positive interactions with you. The people who bring you down *don't matter.* 

The fact that they keep trying to push their problems onto you just proves THEY can't handle things being out of their control, and once you *believe (*emphasis on 'believe') that their opinions don't fucking matter, it's SO freeing. What helped me was setting boundaries and sticking to them even if they try to fight you. You are WORTH fighting for. You are WORTH getting help from your friends. I like to write in my diary about how I feel if you truly feel like you can't talk to your friends. Then, at least, you can express how you feel while having an understanding of asking your friends what they can *do* for you if you truly feel uncomfortable with strictly venting. 

Boundaries: [https://www.wikihow.com/Establish-Boundaries](https://www.wikihow.com/Establish-Boundaries)

I hope you're okay. If you just need someone to hear you out, then my DMs are open, alright? Good luck. You *are* a good person, and you a worthy of love and respect. THEY, your family, is in the wrong. If they don't know how to talk to you without talking down to you, they don't deserve the time of day."
mentalhealth,fetybhb,t3_eqkbpq,1579381257.0,What do you feel when you starting crying? Overwhelmed? Sad? Homesick?
mentalhealth,fetxysq,t3_eqkh09,1579381155.0,"First of all, take a deep breath. It will be okay. I can't say I exactly know your situation, but I used to shove down my feelings and thoughts, as a result, I could barely ""hear"" them. They didn't feel ""real"", but that was really me trying to ignore them or trying not to feel them.

Since then I've started to keep a diary and vent through writing, just whatever comes instinctually. Typically, whatever comes out on the page is how I feel. What I am trying to say is.. don't panic. Humans are expressive and complex, there are other ways to get into your own psyche and express yourself. If you have not sought help already, please do so. Don't doubt yourself so much, from someone who has (kind of...?) been there, how you think you feel is typically real. 

Good luck, okay? This isn't the end, there are options for you.

mentalhealth,fetwdcv,t3_eqkuki,1579380686.0,"> I cannot seem to figure out what exactly it is. Maybe I need a better perspective? Maybe I need better professional help? Or maybe I just need to stop overthinking. I'm worried all consuming anxiety is gonna kick back again and it's gonna be all the same 2019 repeating itself. I'm not sure what I'm expecting I expected myself to be happy and yet here I am just lost and feel like curling up in bed all day and speak with noone forever. I have this constant feeling that maybe things got better but still something is lacking. Any advice?

First of all, it'll be okay. As someone who is pretty anxious themselves (not trying to compare anxiousness to anxiety) I relate to this a lot. What helped me is realizing that there is not going to be any ONE thing that will lead to happiness. Getting an A on this test will not make me happier or feel worthier. I will just feel emptier after it is over, and that I need to focus on the process and doing things that I value.

This post is a good place to start, I think. I love achieving things, but this makes it so much better and I've been following this advice for a month now and I feel so good about myself!

mentalhealth,fett72l,t3_eqkzw5,1579379785.0,"OP, it seems like you feel empty because you push people away so much that when relationships go wrong of you, you have nobody and nothing to fall back on (hence the emptiness). While I think you and your feelings are valid...I think your friend is entitled to feel how she wants and doesn't owe anything. They didn't *make* you trust them, you chose to, and even then... it's not like they discarded their entire friendship with you. They just want to be friends again, and you can just be friends.

I know this isn't your question, but it seems like you have an avoidant attachment style\*.  Please seek ways to help yourself, as depending on someone else to heal you is unhealthy and will ultimately lead to more heart-break. 

Good luck.

mentalhealth,fets8cd,t3_eql5wf,1579379416.0,">I've been diagnosed with PTSD few month ago with depression and I am seeing a therapist since then once every week. The thing is, I have developed symptoms, horrible nightmares where I wake up sweating heavily, panic attack where my body is convulsing, I lose track of time, I feel like I have 2 personalities, me who want to get better, see friends, be happy and another one is dragging me down, cutting myself, saboting what I am trying to do, trying to isolate me.

Obviously this isn't ""NORMAL"" but I've been informed by my own therapist that starting therapy can make you relive the trauma, this is often a response. With that said, it's common sense for the transition into therapy ESPECIALLY for *PTSD* to be smooth. If your therapist isn't taking you seriously or offering some way to help her, drop her.

Seriously, you don't owe her anything. This is about YOU, this about YOUR recovery, not her confidence in her capabilities. Anyway, I hope things begin to look up for you."
mentalhealth,fetruqt,t3_eqidfr,1579379202.0,"Hey, man! You got all the tools at your disposal, so you are DEFINITELY NOT back to square one. ""Failing"" or in sort of interpretation of failure is part of every process. I promise this is another hurdle to jump.

I don't feel like its comparable to full-blown depression, but what helps me when I'm in a slump is to write down *why* I'm doing and put it where I can see it all the time (in my diary, which I write in often, or a sticky-note), or you can set reminders for yourself. OR you could do things that don't require a lot of effort where you don't have to leave your room or interact with anyone.

I love car rides, I enjoy them, and I don't have to talk to anyone!

Please don't give up on yourself. Just because this situation FEELS hopeless, doesn't me *YOU* are hopeless. Baby-steps are key. Even if you're just doing something that ""feels"" small (like watching a funny series or video) it will mean a lot over time.

I believe you can do it!

Well, try this out:  [https://exploringyourmind.com/insecure-attachment-3-different-types](https://exploringyourmind.com/insecure-attachment-3-different-types/)

I'm not sure what to say, only that don't beat yourself over it. There are others who you will find."
mentalhealth,fetr415,t3_eqk1fb,1579378665.0,"Firstly, ""access"" her. Ask her the following questions:  


1. Do you have suicidal thoughts?
2. Do you have a plan to kill yourself? 
3. Do you have the means to/have gathered the means to kill yourself? 
4. Are you going to kill yourself?

If she answers yes to number 1 only, then she is at ""low"" risk. If she answers to 1 and 2, she is at high risk. If she answers yes to 1, 2, 3 and 4 (3 and 4 are typically intertwined) then she is at extremely high risk. If she answers yes, DO NOT promise that you won't tell anyone. Intervention is essential here. At any level, someone must know. Let them know about these questions has so that the appropriate action can be taken.

 For example, if she has the means to kill herself, she must be observed and separated from weapons/tools. 

Are her parents accepting of her transgenderism? Do they know? How would they respond to her potential mental illness? I suggest you tell someone, anyone who can help her in some way because she needs it. Does your school have a therapist or counselor? A teacher that you trust or know inside or outside of school?"
mentalhealth,fetpb7y,t3_eqk7qw,1579377945.0,"Hey, OP. There's nothing wrong with being overwhelmed. This is going to sound a bit heartless, but if she never opens up to you again/internalizes it, that is something she should sort through in therapy.

Think about it... if your friend (you) is trying to express that your behaviors scare them and your first extinct is to isolate yourself, then your friend needs to learn how to take constructive criticism and learn how to cope with her own anxiety (at least to a degree). This isn't healthy, but ultimately out of your control. 

I used to try and ""save"" people and self-sacrifice a lot in the past. As a result, I learned that a good rule of thumb is if that said person doesn't have a plan/goal when they talk to you about this kind of stuff, then you shouldn't feel *obligated* (key-word here, obligated) to ""save them"". If they just want to vent, that's fine.

> couldn’t get out, there was no way to escape the absolute sword fight coming out of her mouth. I wanted to be there with her to help her, and I knew that it was best for someone to be there with her and that she needed it, but at the same time, it was just so scarring. I hated hearing her scream about how everyone hated her and how she just wants to die, etc. etc. she finally calmed down after about an hour of this. I’ve been nervous around her ever since, and I get uncomfortable when I’m in enclosed spaces with angry or upset people. I wanted to be there for my friend, but I couldn’t handle it. 

Man, that sounds awful. I've only heard someone have a panic attack through a closed door as I was heading to sleep and *my* heart was racing. It is scary. As valid as your friend's anxiety is, and your friend's mental illnesses are... PLEASE tell them. You're considering their feelings, but what about you? Don't you matter, too?

By being honest, you just risk putting yourself in this situation over and over. And, honestly, I think that your friend needs a wake-up call to how her actions are affecting you. I think that you're worried that you'd be ""punishing"" your friend for something she can't control, but she CAN control her actions. 

 I don't mean to blame your friend for her anxiousness, but she is clearly smothering you. Just be honest and kind. You don't even need to practice that because when I read this post I can see how much you care, and you've stated your concerns very delicately and tactfully.

(Method 2) How to set boundaries:  [https://www.wikihow.com/Establish-Boundaries](https://www.wikihow.com/Establish-Boundaries)

If she or your friends don't make an effort to change, drop them. Seriously. If they don't acknowledge your boundaries, then on some level they don't take them (and in extension, you) very seriously, and need to grow up and learn empathy. Hoped this helped, and good luck."

IMO I think this happens so often, because from the ""narrative"" perspective, the dynamic is ""easy"" to make interesting, or ""cute"". There are, of course, other traits to contrast-- but now that I'm think about it... I actually like the timid  v assertive personality dynamic (I know this isn't always a trait exclusive to either an extrovert or an introvert).

What's annoying is when dimensional characters/ character development gets side-lined to pay more attention to the author's/directors/artists care-taker fantasy. Like... it's *okay*, but it's not my thing when a person is constantly getting harassed, and someone has to swoop in and save them. It's codependency at this point, and then there's no character growth instigated because they're ex/introvert."
