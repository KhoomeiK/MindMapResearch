NMMNG,fon9ye0,t3_du1zju,1587915367.0,How has your evaluation gone?
carnivore,fmsafn7,t1_fj46wou,1586351061.0,Experienced this as well.
BPD,fjf0e5o,t3_fd448k,1583281628.0,I've suspected I am attracted to others with personality disorders whether it's friends or lovers. I think lovers more but there is no real way for me to confirm either.
BPD,fjezyu1,t1_fjezf54,1583281396.0,Youre very welcome. I hope you're doing better.
BPD,fjei353,t3_fd24qn,1583272077.0,I'm here and understand what you're going through.
BPD,fjds6ne,t1_fjd1v3i,1583258210.0,"Thank you! We do realize that. Unfortunately we are pretty patterned and it is proving to be difficult. I agree it is up to us   but I tend to look for guidance from others instead of trusting my own judgement. With everyday things Im fine but this relationship is more difficult to navigate and leave. 

I haven't been aware and met anyone new yet so I haven't had a chance to test this yet but I honestly think I would shut everyone out. I'm just like you and get way too excited with a new person. I barely sleep or get anything done because I'm constantly thinking about the new person. Probably the best thing would be to find a partner with a majority of similar interests. The two of you would stay on track then. 
Thats a valid thought but that's not how it works for us. I either am spending time doing the things she likes which do not align with my goals or satisfy my drive or I completely isolate myself from her and do all things that are my focus. I think we are codependent or each other so we both won't leave. I recently tried to but couldn't take the pain so I came back."
BPD,fjdfgg3,t1_fjdf6k2,1583252110.0,SE. You?
BPD,fjde62f,t3_fcwkei,1583251421.0,"Pennsylvania, USA"
BPD,fjcx1w8,t3_fctg1a,1583239622.0,"Hi. 
Nice work listening to your emotions and getting on the right track. 

I just came out of a dark place and decided to get myself together too. This is what has worked so far. 

1. It feels good to set boundaries although at times it is tough. I usually distract myself with self improvement and then the urge to bypass boundaries passes. My fp is not my SO and fp has slowly stopped texting me. This is difficult to deal with. I decided to only text them when they text me first. 

2. I am codependent at the moment but know that it is only temporary. My plan is to see a personal therapist and a couples therapist since my partner and I are dependent of each other and are both showing signs of BPD. My hope is our therapists will either help us stay together or give us the tools to separate. 

3. I love myself by focusing on my goals and taking steps to accomplish them. Exercise, diet, schooling for a career change, jiu jitsu, learning a language, and working on my home. 

4. Im not sure how to answer this one. 

5. This is by far the toughest part. I isolate myself and that has been helping. As long as I am busy I'm good to go. The moment I am idle is when I start to spiral. 

Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me for more info.

Edit: elaborated more."
BPD,fj1m7dw,t3_fawymt,1582922985.0,Yep. Same here. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the wake it would leave my family and friends in so the best I can do is hope I don't wake up the next morning. Also undiagnosed. No clue where to start when choosing a therapist. I've got a procrastination thing going.
BPD,fj1lplk,t1_fj1bglh,1582922688.0,This. 100%
BPD,fj0vll9,t1_fj0tdyi,1582908470.0,Pm me if you'd like.
BPD,fj0va6y,t1_fj0tdyi,1582908325.0,Thanks. I hope you get your situation sorted out too. Mine is a little more complicated because it involves attachment to a third party.
BPD,fj0rr1s,t1_fj0qzvd,1582906400.0,"Honestly, Isolation and focus on work, fitness, and school."
BPD,fj0p4mq,t3_favl40,1582904871.0,Going through almost the exact same situation here so I know your pain.
BPD,fiv0jra,t3_f9z9z5,1582751619.0,Yup. Currently doing that now.
BPD,fiuoeur,t1_fiunuvw,1582745253.0,It really is. Probably the most difficult thing I've ever dealt with.
BPD,fiun7bb,t1_fiubmz3,1582744604.0,You know what I mean.
BPD,fitz7oo,t1_fity1g3,1582732409.0,^ this. Have you come across any potential love interests since the breakup?
BPD,fitw8f9,t3_f9ug1n,1582730722.0,Same here. I understand what you're going through. I've broken several girl's hearts and never realized it was my fault until about a week ago. Recently I led a girl only to break her heart and now I'm devastated because she won't talk to me at all.
BPD,fik8ns1,t1_fii569l,1582475303.0,Im sorry to hear that. Either way it still really sucks that he was so ambiguous about it. I know that would eat me alive.
BPD,fik25cs,t1_fik1ky7,1582470922.0,I agree.  I go through the same thing.
BPD,fii31o3,t1_fihzhl9,1582416831.0,I understand that. I hope he reaches out to you and you're able to find out. It could also have been just him and nothing you did at all.
BPD,fihotal,t1_fidc1yz,1582412592.0,What a douche!
BPD,ficdfjd,t3_cyoqm6,1582343930.0,What a champ! Plus one million for that guy and 2 million for you opening up to someone you like.
BPD,fi91zpg,t3_f71to7,1582253661.0,Yup  i stopped talking to a whole group of friends because of this.  I would send a message i thought was hilarious and when no one responded i would curse them and spiral. Then when i saw them about a year later i felt bad and apologized and they had no clue what i was talking about. Aka they genuinely missed my one comment among the other 50.
BPD,fi7upm2,t3_f6w9p4,1582228514.0,"Yes. Not to the same monetary value but expensive to me.

Edit: basically it has to be above a certain amount for me to even consider it while also not being crazy expensive. I could literally have two of the same product next to each other and if the price difference is too low I wont buy it."
BPD,fi7scqc,t3_f6xfl2,1582227278.0,Sure do.
