1. A significant other should not be burdened with the responsibility of ""bringing us back"" when our minds go back to war. Dogs dont have bills, work stress, other obligations. They're more readily emotionally available at a moments notice. 
2. If it's as severe as it sounds, a service dog, possibly meds, and a therapist are very much in order for this veterans well being. A single person can not fill in for all of these and maintain their own sanity. 
3. A conversation (or several) when your veteran is in the proper state of mind... chances are, they know what brings them back, what grounds them, what makes them feel secure, or that their family is secure so that they may stand down. 

We each have our own triggers and our own soothings. Something that works flawlessly with me may make it worse for your veteran. Take advice here as a suggestion for a topic of conversation first.

Some soups, I'll add a bit of small diced ham. Some or my heartier soups (that I usually make midwinter so have not calculated calories) have chopped sausage and cubed potatoes in them."
1200isplenty,f591nhf,t1_f58z4rc,1572069197.0,"I'm only 5'2"". I dont usually eat chicken because I hate the taste. It always seems dry and flavorless to me. I do like cheese and some days have a babybel wheel for a snack, perhaps eating 2 instead of 1 could help. I dont usually dip my snack veggies, but I could look into finding something I like, such as the hummus you mentioned. I'm not a fan of the greasy mouth feel from oil so I dont usually use it. The eggs, I guess I could do a couple instead of just one also. 

Thank you for these suggestions. I had a terrible relationship with food before (thus the 200lbs). And a lot of how I've changed that relationship is by only eating what I *truly* enjoy. And I only eat about the equivalent of 1-2 eggs at a time. It's enough that after about 10 minutes, I'm not hungry anymore. It was using that time that stopped me from the unhealthy gorging habit I had before."
