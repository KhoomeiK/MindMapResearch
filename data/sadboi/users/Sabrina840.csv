Stepmom,fqofyj5,t1_fqofxfi,1589514366.0,Thank you so much 😊
Stepmom,fqnzgri,t1_fqnxmvh,1589504471.0,"Thank you and yeah, I have been thinking about doing therapy after the virus is over, but that's because I have severe depression and high anxiety 😅 my bf has been helping me cope somehow through all it so far, but I know I need professional help."
Stepmom,fqnyyyy,t1_fqnwd67,1589504191.0,"Yeah, we put her in time out and stuff, and he spanks her sometimes, but it doesn't work. She runs out of timeout and laughs of spanking. Also, her mom recently up and decided to move to Florida, so now we have primary custody of her."
Stepmom,fqnvdme,t1_fqnso1q,1589502150.0,"Thank you for your comment, but my bf does try, but it doesn't work out too well. My SD just laughs it off and claims she is constantly forgetting our talks to her and about how she treats me. And in her eyes, mom's opinion means more than dad's."
Stepmom,fqnv2xo,t1_fqnps4f,1589501979.0,"Thank you for your comment. And honestly I don't know. My SD and I have some good moments, but not many. Like a few hours ago, we just sat in her room and read books together for a little over an hour. I love the moments we have, but it seems like everytime she talks to her mother she gets worse and gets more nasty. I want to try and find a way to work it out somehow bc I don't want to give up on something I just don't know yet. I don't know if we just haven't reach that point where we have bonded properly yet or what."
thedivision,fqnhk17,t1_fqng01h,1589494970.0,Yes! We would join that clan! 🤣
thedivision,fqncecf,t1_fqn31ip,1589492372.0,Oh? 🤣
Stepmom,fqmxprg,t1_fqmov71,1589485277.0,"Thank you for your comment. Do I really want to spend my life dealing with this? No, not really. I'm trying to find ways to make it better. I do have moments with my stepdaughter that are good and lovely, but they are that much. And my bf and the BM aren't on great standing. The BM literally does whatever the hell she wants. My bf does try to help me through this, but she resilient. We've been talking about trying different approaches to this and trying to find out how to make the situation better."
Stepmom,fqmx3t1,t1_fqmqqsd,1589484983.0,"Thank you so much for your comment, and yes I really really wanna make it work. My bf does try and help me a lot and tell her to stop and stuff, but she just doesn't listen. I'm definitely gonna take you advice and try that. I do have some good moments with my stepdaughter, but they're few and far in between. I make sure to follow through on any of my punishments I set. My bf is more lax with that thing, but I always believe that if I say I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna do it, or try my best to do something similar. But thank you so much for the reply. I'll definitely try this 💚"
thedivision,fqmnf38,t1_fqmhtl4,1589480349.0,"Yeah, same. I mean look at their face! It's so cute 😍"
thedivision,fqmncja,t1_fqmktnz,1589480315.0,Really?!?! 🤣🤣🤣
Stepmom,fqmk69p,t1_fqmfsay,1589478786.0,I'm so sorry 😥
Stepmom,fqmb37t,t1_fqm9vp6,1589474513.0,"I really try and I have to stay in my bedroom for breaks bc sometimes she just gets me so angry. Her dad and I tell her to stop and try to punish her, but she just laughs at us. If we try and put her in time out, she just runs away and hours later, were still trying to put her in time out. He spanks her, she laughs and says it doesn't hurt. A CPS lady told me that if she spits on me, I should do it back, but it doesn't work. She just says it's gross and does it anyways. It really takes a lot of strength to not snap or leave, but seeing my boyfriends face and all his love makes it okay."
Anxiety,fl1kn92,t3_flvow6,1584730878.0,"Yes, Everytime I get anxious, my stomach turns sour. Literally, I don't even need to feel anxious consciously, but if I do subconsciously, my stomach gurgles and churns and gets really nauseous. It's terrible."
AskReddit,ez5pizq,t3_czvmph,1567702664.0,I learned recently that smoking pipes are not magic. That they have a bunch of parts to make them useable and there's a little hole to allow the smoke through the pipe. I thought it was movie magic til just now. I'm twenty years old 😂
