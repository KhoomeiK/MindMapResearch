But trust me the more you think about it the more it gets worse. You have to do like when you remove a patch, you just have to do it quickly and without think because it will scare you more than before. I hope that my advise will help you. Good luck!

2. Tell it to your closest friend or to someone you really trust so you can have some support because in this situation is the most important thing

3. The idea of coming out with a joke is nice but you have to be sure that your parents understand that you are serious and if you dont want to say it face to face you can do it by a message like I did and it will be easier

Good luck :)"

I know that what i said is probably is the most common advise but it's because it's true so I think you have to take your time to prepare and then come out to her

I hope i have helped and I hope that everything will fix and get better for you!!
