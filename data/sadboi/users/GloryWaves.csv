I didn’t think about this too much because I’m very good about having a sense of ironic humor - I genuinely thought he was joking. 

I found out later he had an e621 account and a fursona called Zyklo (as in, Zyklon B!!!). I accepted that also, he can be who he wants, whatever. I even bought him a furry body pillow cover lmfao. then the mask dropped and he started talking unironically about how bad The Jews are, how they control the media, how the holocaust was fabricated. how he hated gays and thought they shouldn’t have rights. how women should stay home and raise the children. I stayed with him for a little longer after that because I wanted to be with someone (read: low self esteem). eventually that type of hatred and narcissism from him turned towards me. he would constantly blow me off, say hurtful things and just generally be gross. we ended it on this past New Years, our senior year. in the end, we both ended up hating each other. tl;dr: don’t ignore the red flags."
