mentalillness,fpvm6k4,t1_fpvbeja,1588947558.0,"Bipolar is a tough one for sure. I definitely miss the manic swings where I could be the life of the party and be at my most creative self (as I perceived it). 
But the lows are so painful, for me but also to those closest to me. Which is why stability is much more rewarding for the long term.
If friends are lost along the way, they aren't there for your best wellbeing. You decide what you want for yourself."
mentalillness,foqpud2,t3_g8tbk2,1587998617.0,"You can definitely ask for a diagnostic assessment, when I went through it it took a little more than hour to get through all the questions. As there are more than 300. I'm pretty sure I only took one of the 3 or 4 that are offered. I didn't take the ADD/ADHD one, some of my friends went through that one and it's kinda challenging, fun, and wears you out.
The personality disorders/ anxiety test that took was a lot of strange questions with A or B answers.
In any case, if you're in the US. It cost a pretty penny to get done."

Best advice I've got is look into mindfulness meditation or yoga. Takes the mind off of stresses as a practice, can maybe help with the headaches. 
Don't get wrapped up in your family's choices and interpersonal businesses. Seems like a chore that you can't control and you burning yourself up over ruminating about such things. Live your life <3
Watch out for toxic relationships, keep the good eggs close.
Good luck with your path."
mentalillness,fkhemfa,t3_figyjq,1584196926.0,"A diagnosis can be placed and people with mild symptoms/ moderate symptoms can live productive and healthy lives; forget about their condition altogether. 

 Though stressors and triggers can sometimes bring out some of those symptoms, especially high levels of stress in any life event. When you have the diagnosis already in place, you can use tools to help get past any difficult stress. You might not be able to cope the same way others do in these moments."

mentalillness,fiaxnl6,t3_f7a5b5,1582310443.0,"It can take any number of days/weeks for meds or a combo to fully take effect. Your onset symptoms may be a reaction to the sudden change to a combo?I would absolutely keep a detailed record of what you're feeling on a time frame for your health care provider so that if you do need a change in treatment they can help you out the best they can. Don't be afraid to offer up your values as well for what you want too, if it seems like too much all at once you can ask for a second opinion.I've been through some changes similar with tingling sensation in my hands for a week, and dissociation. But it passed. Combinations can be tough though.Best of luck!"

I've noticed improvement in emotional regulation and how to develop strategies that create relief before and after stressful situation (like, setting up each day for success, then having plans for taking care of self too)   
The biggest thing is you're taking a step to focus on you for a moment, and that's huge. That will help you're family is the long run, because you are so loved by them."
