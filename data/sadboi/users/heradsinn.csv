dpdr,fqqkn2o,t3_gk6fz2,1589567182.0,"Dude, so relatable. I am quite ‚Äùrecovered‚Äù from dpdr, but I think understanding the condition is very important in order to have any chance at all of recovering. Just know that dpdr, as awful and terrifying and soul drenching as it is, is your body‚Äôs way of protecting you. Because you (or your body, or your brain, who knows?) decided at some point that the emotions you are feeling are just too painful, and that it/you can‚Äôt take this shit anymore. And this is obvious from reading your story, especially with the second girl. You just were so broken by the emotions, and they are so intense, that you quite literally have to put up a wall as defence. 

This is just what worked for me, and although I have heard this from others too and psychologists and psychiatrists, I‚Äôm not saying this is the solution. But what worked for me was just letting go. I have had DPDR for many, many years, constantly, 24/7. And when I figured out what it was and became aware of it I was absolutely terrified. And I felt that I might never get better, that I one day ‚Äùsnap out‚Äù of it, that I wake up 60 years old and I‚Äôve lived my entire life not feeling anything. And I was completely filled with dread, for so many years. But eventually I drifted out of that too. I just accepted, and stopped caring about that (just as I had stopped caring about my unreal life too). And I would let myself just sit with that, just allow myself to not experience reality, and (most importantly) to allow myself to be filled with dread about that. Instead of fighting the onset of unreality, fighting the dream and the haze, I just stopped caring about that. 
And I‚Äôve had episodes where it has come back too. But I just then calm down, allow myself to feel derealised, and so forth. I think that ‚Äùdetachment‚Äù to some degree might be the solution to many of our problems. Instead of (desperately) fighting our inner demons, we acknowledge that they are there, and then deal with them.

Anyways, this was my own rant as much as it was input on your situation. I really do feel your pain, and I know what you‚Äôre going through. Just know that what you‚Äôre feeling is your body‚Äôs defence against pain. And good luck, dude. I wish you all the best."

I have been struggling so much lately with being able to support a close friend of mine who is doing really badly, struggling a lot and is suicidal. I have felt so confused and lost for the past weeks, not knowing how to help and unfortunately doing many of the things you outlined shouldn‚Äôt be done. After reading this I feel much less lost.
It also feels better knowing that my feelings after a recent breakup are normal / warranted, and that I hadn‚Äôt been over-obsessing with her.
Thank you so much for this."

But on the other hand I have much more derealisation than depersonalisation, but I haven‚Äôt seen anybody else describe what you experienced.

But DPDR takes weird forms, not recognising yourself or your body parts. And the brain is complex, so it‚Äôs very possible."

I‚Äôd say that libertarianism is what resonates the best with me and I‚Äôm pretty anti-government, but I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of being stuck in my patterns of thoughts. I mean, after all I have no idea whether my reasoning is ‚Äúright‚Äù. And although the left are many times seemingly insane, I believe that there must be merit to their beliefs. 
Mental health is a very large issue though, and it must be absolutely dealt with. What do you think is a good way of trying to deal with this epidemic?

mentalhealth,f8c3fny,t1_f8bzd1a,1574451540.0,"This was a way more balanced and fair description than I would have imagined, thank you.

Wouldn‚Äôt the conservatives be less tolerant to mental illness though, as progressiveness is something at least commonly thought of as left/democratic? And from listening to democrats, they seem to be more focused on the under-privileged, on larger government, more social engineering etc. Is this not the case, then, in your opinion?

Edit: I.E. democrats with their tolerance and more social welfare would be the ones who propagate for more help to the mentally ill, no?"

changemyview,f3950qm,t3_dfs709,1570743757.0,"Many good points of views being presented so far. This is something I have struggled with for a long time. On the one hand I intuitively feel that people have the right to self-defence and that that should be equal between the genders. If a woman attacks a man the man should be allowed to punch back.
On the other hand, from a more logical point of view, I think that the concept of self-defence is a paradox. Firstly, because violence is wrong, and I don‚Äôt think that anybody has the moral right to violence against another human being. But also the fact that when somebody attacks you first, the entire reasoning behind self-defence is that that initial agression is wrong. But thus, it seems to me, it‚Äôs been proven that agression is wrong and it would be morally wrong for you to use self-defence, as the entire premise is that violence is wrong.
Although I emotionally feel that self-defence should be allowed, I fail to see the reasoning behind it. And this viewpoint is the same as I have with the capital punishment. The reason you want to execute murderers is because what they did - murder - was wrong. But then you can‚Äôt execute them, because, as we concluded, murder is wrong.

Please share your opinions, because I‚Äôm genuinely struggling with this."

mentalhealth,f2bfcl6,t1_f27asb9,1570125694.0,"This is the tricky part really. For me, it was really just havig the mindset to allow it (this sounds so clich√© but for real). When you recognise that you‚Äôre in a situation where you might be feeling, or should be feeling, you have to be alert. At times, I could physically feel how the emotions that were about to occur got supressed. For many years I felt this kind of melancholy over how my emotional response to everything was almost zero, and I honestly realised what a loss that was. So for years the desire to get my emotions back built up, and it‚Äôs along those lines I mean when I say to have the mindset.

Heads up, though. Emotions are necessary and you should do all you can to get them back, but man are they painful. This has been the best and worst year of my life. A lot of emotional pain, sadness, irritability but also joy and genuine happiness for the first time in a while. It does beat the numbness, though, for sure."
mentalhealth,f279625,t3_dcbstg,1570033163.0,"It‚Äôs interesting that you mention this, because I myself had really severe alexithymia in combination with DPDR. I‚Äôm pretty much gotten rid of it now. What I did was, in combination with therapy, really focus and work on allowing myself to feel emotions and actively try to have them. A kind of mental fight to not suppress them. Of course, getting healthy from the dpdr and depression (with antidepressants) was crucial. So in summary, I would say that working towards a better mental health in the ways you would with other illnesses helped at least me. It might depend on what/if you have other underlying problems too."
