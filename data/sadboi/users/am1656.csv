Psychiatrists are medical doctors and therefore focus on the medical model of mental distress and part of their way of treating people will be with medication alongside therapeutic methods.

Psychologists focus on therapeutic methods and may even be critical of the medicalisation of mental health issues.  

I think you really need to spend more time researching exactly what these roles involve, the models that are used, and the evaluations and criticisms of each different approach taken to see which role aligns best with you and the way in which you understand mental health issues, what causes them and how they should be treated."

It has been pretty commonly discussed that individuals who die while testing positive for Coronavirus will be included in the death count even if that wasn’t the direct cause of death. As this BBC article states, it may be the direct cause, contributory factor, or just something present at the time of death: https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51979654

I wish I had the article on the suicide death to hand, but I’m in no way trying to suggest that’s the norm, more that that is the extreme end. It is true though that if someone tests positive for Coronavirus at their time of death, or in some places, if it’s just presumed that they had it based on symptoms, this is included on the death certificate and therefore in the statistics."

I actually recognise you from the anxiety sub which has been a life saver for me since February. I had one of the worst periods of anxiety of my life in February, because the stuff we were seeing from a China was truly horrific. I couldn’t leave my bed and I was about ready to give up.

Even from all of my reading of the anxiety good news thread, and seeing all of the IFR estimates from antibody and prevalence studies, this fear and anxiety is still there. 

I relate a lot to what you’re saying, and I know that if I started to have symptoms I’d panic, despite knowing the statistics. The psychological damage that has been done by the media is wide spread and I think it’s impact will be seen for a long time."

However, due to lack of testing kits, when it started to spread more, you had to have a pretty bad case to be tested. So people who had tested positive and had a ‘mild’ case were on the worse end of the ‘mild’ spectrum and basically had bad symptoms but just not bad enough to be hospitalised."
LockdownSkepticism,fpohp6q,t1_fpofdt5,1588784682.0,"I’m British and haven’t noticed this being politicised as much here (although I’m staying away from social media so that might be why).

I’m also a left-wing Labour Party supporter. I’m not entirely sure what my views on the lockdown are yet, but I cannot understand how those of us on the left can completely ignore the long term effects of this. It’s the poorest people in minimum wage jobs who are going to be most affected by this financially. Small business owners are losing their livelihoods. Retail and hospitality workers are losing their jobs and will continue to do so when businesses in those sectors start to shut down. Domestic abuse and mental health issues are on the rise. Cancer diagnoses and treatment for other health issues are being being delayed. 

The impact of a long term lockdown and shutting down of the economy should be something that those of us on the left care deeply about, especially considering it’s the most vulnerable that are likely to be the most affected."
Anxiety,fpody7y,t1_fpntytn,1588782874.0,"I know what you mean. Seeing numbers like this is really upsetting. In the U.K. we have the highest number of recorded deaths in the whole of Europe.

I’m trying not to focus on any predictions, big or small, too much as we can’t be sure of what is going to happen, so focussing on predictions too closely can make us feel disheartened if the numbers end up being higher.

What I will say though is to keep in mind how lenient they are with reporting Covid deaths. Anyone dies with the virus is counted, regardless if that was the actual, direct cause of death or not. This is happening to the point that I’ve seen a report of someone committing suicide and it being counted because they tested positive."

I intentionally didn’t post this in the good news thread, because I didn’t want to come across as brushing off the deaths of older people, or anyone, and I know there are people of varying ages here. I also feel a little uncomfortable associating death with ‘good news’ because every death from this is a tragedy.

Statistically, in every age group, you are highly unlikely to die from this. However, there are a lot of young people here, including myself, who’s anxiety, encouraged by media portrayals of deaths of young people, has made them believe that they’re definitely going die from this. Looking at the actual stats, and IFR estimates from antibody studies, shows how minimal that risk actually is."
Anxiety,fpec9s8,t1_fpe9vl4,1588544661.0,"Coming from the U.K. I think the lockdown was the definitely the best thing to do at the time, with the information we had, especially given what we saw happening in Italy and Iran. The science and modelling at the time also indicated that this was the best thing to do to ensure hospitals didn’t get overwhelmed. There were some indications that even with the lockdown there wouldn’t be enough beds.

However, we passed the peak a few weeks ago, and the NHS didn’t come close to being overwhelmed. As the science has developed, most of the research, particularly from antibody studies, has indicated that the virus is far less deadly than first believed. 

We now have clearly defined groups of at risk people. I believe that as long as we put the measures in place to protect the most vulnerable people, the U.K. should start gradually loosening restrictions soon and take an approach somewhat similar to Sweden’s.

As you’ve said, the lockdown had achieved its purpose. We need to start focussing now on a sustainable, long-term solution that allows people to live somewhat ‘normal’ lives while preventing a peak in pressure on hospital systems, and protecting the vulnerable."

So, just a little reminder, if you are young, you are incredibly unlikely to die of this. (Just to note, at any age you are very very unlikely to die of this, but I specifically wanted to focus on the media narrative of deaths of young people here).

Anxiety,fpd1tb1,t1_fpctm67,1588518014.0,"There have been observations that people who are overweight or obese represent a higher percentage of those who are seriously ill than those who are a healthy weight.

From what I’m aware, there haven’t been studies to prove that obesity or being overweight in and of itself directly affects Covid outcomes, when other factors are accounted for. Obesity is associated with a number of health issues, especially as people get older, and so it’s possible that those health issues are what put certain overweight people at risk, instead of just the weight itself.

Over all, I think we should be careful about drawing conclusions from weight demographics when looking at the type of people in ICU. For the U.K. I saw somewhere that about 70% of people in ICU are overweight. But about 60-70% of the entire population of the U.K. are overweight, which would suggest that the number of overweight people in ICU is in proportion to the number in the general population. If the majority of people in a country are overweight then it goes without saying that the majority of deaths will also be people who are overweight."

Anyone over 65 with minor symptoms can get a test.

Additionally, tests take a while to come back and be reported.

The most important indicator of where we are on the curve is the amount of people in hospital with this. This number peaked has been consistently decreasing, considerably so in London. The amount of people with the virus is going down, we are just testing more widely."

Additionally, all people over the age of 65 with symptoms, and people whose work has to be done outside of the home with symptoms, will now be able to get testing. This rapidly growing ability to testing larger portions of society will be important in being able to keep this under control going forward.

- Additionally, one of the potential treatments being tested has today been entered into the next phase of clinical trials which I assume suggests it’s showing promising results. Dominic Raab didn’t clarify which one this is but I’ll update if it’s mentioned further on.

We do know that severe cases can cause damage to the lungs. Although we don’t know this for Covid yet, because it’s too early to say, the body is able to repair itself. Severe pneumonia from other causes can also cause long term damage to the lungs, but this can be repaired at least to some degree.

Again, the blood clots are not something only related to Coronavirus. We’ve discussed strokes/blood clots quite a lot over the last through days, so it’s worth scrolling through here for some reassurance.

Complications like those you’ve listed do sometimes occur. They also occur with the flu and are not new in and of themselves. They’re also rare, and mostly observed in high risk groups.

Honestly, the drop in London is wild. We are well over the other side of the curve right now.

This is not the same as saying antibodies are useless or there’s no level of immunity after recovery. There’s just no evidence yet, largely because it’s far too early for there to be evidence.

In the link below, we can also see that unlike Swine flu where 80% of virus related deaths were in people under 65, people under 65 only account for around 10% of the deaths with Covid:

Anxiety,foc56t5,t1_foc311t,1587667240.0,"The death rate in your age range is still sooo low. The initial data we had from China was 0.2% of people under 40 who get this would die. All of the estimations I’ve seen since that have been even lower. You are so so incredibly unlikely to die from this, even if you are overweight."
Anxiety,fobv4jz,t1_fo7tjrx,1587664000.0,"Although the researchers at Oxford are hoping to have 1 million vaccines ready for autumn in the hope it works, I don’t think the government is planning on administering these on a widespread basis. At the Downing Street Briefing yesterday prof Chris Whitty made it very clear that we are unlikely to have a vaccine for a year.

Any potential vaccine will be subject to strict testing for safety here in the U.K. as it would be in the USA. There aren’t plans to fast track an unsafe vaccine. The government have been very big all along on assuring the quality of anything we use, which is why we haven’t started antibody testing yet - none of the tests have been good enough.

I also can’t imagine the government would allow people to fly over to get the vaccine. Any vaccine would be provided on the NHS for which you’d need to be registered with the NHS."
Anxiety,fo9mjjr,t1_fo8e0tp,1587623981.0,Yeah I’m hoping for some clarification. I was a little bit taken aback when he said that in the briefing because he didn’t expand on what that would mean. Thank you for this!
Anxiety,fo9lr4f,t1_fo9laqe,1587623273.0,"I had my last orthodontist appointment just before lockdown in the UK and I was concerned, but the orthodontist said that between each patient they wipe everything down with sanitising wipes (chair, goggles etc) which is just standard procedure as infection control is incredibly important even in normal times. They’re incredible hygienic places :)"
Anxiety,fo87qpz,t1_fo84qpc,1587591420.0,"We haven’t needed to go to that extreme because the lockdown measures are working. We can see this in the stable hospital numbers in most areas of the country and the consistently decreasing hospital numbers in London. (Source: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/880756/2020-04-22_COVID-19_Press_Conference_Slides__13_.pdf)

The truth is, no one has the ‘right’ answers in how to respond to this situation right now, and just because some countries have taken stricter measures, that doesn’t mean that they’re better than ours. We have to be guided by the science we have, and there are so many experts in our country working on this right now. 

As you’ve said, our hospitals haven’t been overwhelmed. We were able to build the Nightingale hospitals before we needed them, and largely haven’t needed them so far at all. In places like Italy their health system did get majorly overwhelmed which likely contributed to a different response.  The whole point of the lockdown was to ease pressure on the NHS which it has - it was never to eradicate the disease.

As a side note, from watching the Downing Street Briefings, prof Chris Whitty is very aware of the side effects of lockdown, on people’s mental and physical health. These have to be taken into account too on any measures we take.

Edit: as another side note, you posted one of the best and most helpful comments to me in the old megathread, so thank you for that! It was one of the comments that helped me out of a really bad place. I hope you’re keeping well. I know things seem bleak right now, but I’m confident they’re getting better :)"
Anxiety,fo82jcj,t1_fo81417,1587588762.0,"Multiple reasons. For example, we’re very lenient with how we classify deaths. There was a good BBC article on this that has been shared on here or the good news thread, but I don’t have it to hand I’m afraid. Essentially, anyone who died with the virus is classed as dying of it regardless of whether it is the direct cause of death or not. Someone could be 3 days from dying of terminal cancer, but if they test positive at the time of death, they’ll be recorded as a Covid death.

Secondly, we don’t have a ‘cure’ for this yet. There are many trials of drugs and treatments going on, but not everyone is enlisted on these. Treatment is oxygen, ventilators etc.

A lot of the deaths being reported now happened within the last 1-2 weeks. The daily reports are not reflections of what happened the day before as reporting is delayed.

Additionally, the number of cases are ridiculously under reported. I’m not sure which person from public health said this, but I think it was Sir Patrick - it’s expected that the number of actual cases are at least 10-20 times higher than reported due to lack of testing.

On top of that, although infection rate is now low in the community, it’s higher in places like hospitals and care homes. Sadly, that’s where the most vulnerable, at risk, people are.

Your comments are generally level-headed and balanced. I think you approach this situation in a rational way.

The things those people are saying are extreme. What evidence is there for everyone getting evicted from apartments blocks and either becoming homeless or dead? Governments are trying to find balances between protecting the economy and the public health. That is not the same as sacrificing babies.

The discord server sounds like quite a toxic environment. Maybe it’s a good idea to take a step back from it for now, but if not, please don’t let other people’s spirals affect the rational, well-evidenced conclusions you’ve come to. You need to protect your mental health."

Anxiety,fnln53y,t1_fnlmici,1587056362.0,So do I! The fact that the R0 thing probably won’t make headlines is part of the reason I much prefer watching these briefings. The media will definitely try and pick out the negatives and exaggerate them for their headlines.
Anxiety,fnlm2jp,t1_fnllhji,1587055853.0,"It’s certainly great news but as Sir Patrick mentioned the infection rate is still higher in some places like care homes and hospitals. He also made the point that we need to know exactly what the R0 is because if it’s too close to 1 we run the risk of a new wave if we lift restrictions. 

So it’s great news, but we need to be cautious! However to me, the government wanting to be cautious in itself is a positive."
Anxiety,fnlju5t,t3_fj2y1a,1587054778.0,"I’m sure the headlines are going to be very negative about the Downing Street Briefing but here are some positives:

Sir Patrick says that the evidence is that the R0 is below 1 in the general public.

He also said that cases are flattening and maybe decreasing.

In terms of hospital beds, in many regions, including London, beds filled are decreasing which is in line with the view that the the R0 is below 1 which he said suggests that we’re in a good place.

Edit: As a side note, I’d really recommend that people in the UK watch the Downing Street Briefings if they want to keep up to date, but avoid sensationalised news. The journalists that ask questions can be a little bit annoying and intentionally inflammatory sometimes but even then you are able to become aware of potential criticisms while also getting reasonable, calm responses directly from the government and public health officials. I find it helps me feel informed, but it doesn’t trigger my anxiety."
Anxiety,fnlfbd9,t1_fnldkeh,1587052550.0,"This is a great article, thank you! We kinda already new this, but it’s good to see more evidence of this virus being that of the ‘close contacts’.

Apparently, Deputy CMO Prof Jonathon Van-Tam believes that the curve is already beginning to bend in terms of hospital admissions.

Like you said, as we're coming to our peak, the numbers don't look great, but the next week or so is the worst of it, and things should begin to improve from there."
