BPD,exa680r,t3_crvgaz,1566100243.0,"wish my boyfriend would ask this question haha. i'm sure each person is different, but when giving her space, i'd say to be very reassuring - something like ""hey, we're going to talk soon, but lets both take a breather and just get our heads right so we don't say anything hurtful to each other."" 

have a conversation when you're not arguing. set some ground rules on what definitely isn't allowed when both of you are heated in the moment. talk about what each other needs when they feel upset. I know for BPD the main thing is feeling like they have you as a stable source of support - affirm that. hope this helps."
