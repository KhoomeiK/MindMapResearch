bujo,fgpiq3w,t3_ezk2rr,1581005596.0,I'm doing something similar for my nine year old daughter who always seems to leave for school with something missing.
PacificCrestTrail,fdfxvln,t1_fdewosi,1578373255.0,"One of the best things I learned on trail from a trail sister is how to tie my shoes in a way that they don’t come untied all the time, but still untie easily at the end of the day. Here’s a link to the particular method I use: [Tie Yo Shoes](https://youtu.be/P0RIfDEiEPg)"
cricut,f8wh3s1,t1_f8wgtfn,1574890663.0,Thank you!! Do you also sell your designs somewhere? Would love to check out your shop if you have one!
cricut,f8wffxr,t3_e2ks33,1574889599.0,What material did you use to cut your patterns on? Card stock? Plastic stencil sheets?

BPD,f7zl4r2,t3_dy6vjt,1574112312.0,"As a woman, I’d love to be able to also track my period with this to see how hormonal shifts are potentially contributing to my mental state as well. I feel like when I’m having a moment where I feel myself starting to spiral and feel extra rage, I always go check my Fitbit first to see when my period is due. Is there a way to add this as a “factor”?"
BPD,f7fgbsm,t1_f7evl61,1573678792.0,"My therapist asked me this exact question last week. “Maybe if you didn’t expect him to fill all of these roles at once, you would be more satisfied with the state of your relationship?”

She’s right... I would be."
BPD,f7bql62,t1_f7bo39p,1573575364.0,"Lord, wait until you hit the “goes two weeks at a time without talking to you” phase. Crisis Survival Mode would be an understatement. I’m a wreck and it’s all my own doing. Best thing you can do for yourself is to keep not bringing it up, and go through the work of reminding yourself you are loved and you are loveable. Confronting them goes nowhere."
BPD,f6l4k1k,t3_drtwxk,1572928748.0,Thank you for this...
editors,f5nwtc9,t1_f5ka1hr,1572305153.0,Just keep showing the same four or five shots over and over again for 30-40 minutes. Nobody will notice. They do it in “real porn” all the time!
socalhiking,esr9j23,t1_esqelqo,1562219751.0,"It's not just that they're not indigenous to the mountains. Fruit peels need microorganisms in soil to help break them down during decomposition. If you're leaving orange peels on a rocky mountainside, or out in the desert where it's very unlikely to get moisture, they'll just sit and sit for ages. Yes, eventually they may biodegrade, but not in the way they would in a compost heap. Always pack it out."
