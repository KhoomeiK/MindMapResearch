I guess it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve been that Believer and I can understand why they do it. We had to resign because we just couldn‚Äôt handle the members wanting to suck us back in and it was a waste of their time and ours. Hope that helps."

mormon,fcmbmyy,t3_ehrxzs,1577769710.0,"There are 2 really hard things I had to get through in my crisis. 
1) Spiritual experiences-they must be real because I felt them. There is a word for it, it‚Äôs called Frisson(I think that‚Äôs it)- basically you go into something expecting a spiritual outcome and most likely your mind will let you have one.
2) Patriarchal Blessing- turns out there‚Äôs an entire sub of people that share theirs and all or most are the same template. If you had a good Patriarch, they spoke to you a few minutes before your blessing and it seemed more personalized.

My family of 5 went through a very hard crisis and we are out. I go through long periods where I don‚Äôt even think about it but Holidays mean TBM in-laws and I have to remind myself how far I have come from that. 
Good luck in your search for your truth. Like many have said, message me if you find yourself troubled."
