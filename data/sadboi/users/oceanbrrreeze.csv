benzorecovery,fr5mokp,t3_gmfrv6,1589911094.0,Yes it does! It takes awhile but you will feel like yourself once again. I was scared I would never feel like me again but after 5-7 months completely free I felt like me again and it was such an emotional realization. I was on Klonopin for 10 years.

benzorecovery,fozmj9w,t3_gab4a8,1588193154.0,Yup! I've never had social anxiety and when I went off Klonopin BAM. Even family members and really good friends. I felt so much social anxiety around my own husband who I've been with for over 7 years. It's tough but it does get better. My social anxiety 8 months off is so much better than it was when I was tapering.
AskReddit,foz7l2o,t1_foyhisw,1588186013.0,Agreed. Quiet Place lacked a lot of content and didn't deliver anything well. Cinematics we're fine but the rest was just overall overrated imo. The aliens also lacked imagination.
benzorecovery,fonnqno,t3_g88txd,1587922992.0,What methods are you using now to cope with anxiety? And what were the effects of CBD? I'm 5 months off Klonopin and am now on Lexapro but my anxiety is still extreme so I recently started CBD.

Anxiety,fo82z40,t1_fo7ql22,1587588985.0,"Thank you! I greatly appreciate your answer :) I started therapy really early on (9 years old) and unfortunately it didn't help with my anxiety until I got on medications. It only helped a little but not to  function in life without my extreme anxiety getting in the way. I luckily got weened off Klonopin about a year ago which is a huge accomplishment. But now my anxiety is higher than ever, so I'm going to first try the route of CBD oil. Lexapro helps a bit but I feel hyped up all the time on it. Thank you again for your input üòä"
Anxiety,fo7itx2,t1_fo7242y,1587579068.0,Curious as to why you'll never go back on Lexapro? I'm currently on it for anxiety and Seroquel for sleep. Lexapro seems to personally have negative effects for me and I hate it but I'm scared to go off because I'm afraid my anxiety would be too much to handle.

""When I was eight I used too grab lizards and smash them against my penis. I don't know why, I just did. Once I hit puberty, I realized porn really didn't do it too me, then I remember the lizards. They always lived behind the windowsill of my home, we lived on Florida so they were everywhere. So i tried smashing them against my penis and masterbating, using them as lubricant. The thrill was god damn exilirating. I do it about once a month now, and sometimes I look at scalie porn while o do it""

So I work in snow, negative 10 degree weather, rain, then extreme heat. The animals need someone to take care of them. I also get physically exhausted. I walk on average at my zoo 9 miles a day and am constantly lifting 75+lbs of food, hay animals etc. It all depends on what zoo you work at though. Every place is different. I also work a lot of hours. An average daily is 7:30 am to 5:30pm for me. But again every place is different.

So on to rewards is definitely working up close and personal with these exotic animals.  I love taking care of all of my animals. They mean the world to me. I also love the education and joy that these animals bring to kids. To give that to children is super rewarding.

Education will look really good going into a zoo. There are many Zookeeper types, one is an Animal Ambassador keeper where they want someone experienced in both education and animal keeping. I'd suggest volunteering or start an internship at your local zoo to make sure zookeeping is right for you. Usually zoos like to hire within their zoo. I started with education to get into my current zoo by teaching camps and programs at different parks. Best of luck! Zookeeping is a tough job but it's so rewarding.
