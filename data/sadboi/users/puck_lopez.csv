Psoriasis,fr1ugne,t1_fr18ika,1589826147.0,I love and hate living here at the same time our friendly neighborhood for Karl was rolling in and obscured the bridge but it's still my favorite part of the city!

Psoriasis,fqgoo1l,t1_fqdug8y,1589352219.0,"I don't know your situation but I am not shy about my skin and stopped caring about what people say especially your partner. Starting a new relationship with a girl is tough for me because after being with the same girl for 25 years of my life it's all new to me. I was mostly worried about that than worried about what someone thought about my skin. I am 42 years old and don't have time for people who are superficial and only care about looks money or social status. 
I have lived with psoriasis since I was 16 it's all over my body and never do I feel a need to cover up because I don't care what people say! I am bipolar  as well and that shit is only major medical issue I have and really care about because it does affect my life. The only thing I have serious issues with is my mental health and this girl am with now I only cares about whats on inside and shes told me she could care less about some silly skin issues"
Psoriasis,fqdw0md,t3_gi903k,1589297569.0,I have psoriasis as well and was married to a beautiful redhead for 18 years and together for 25 years we have two kids and unfortunately we got divorced but never and I mean never has my psoriasis been an issue with her. I am newly single and I have met a girl who does not care about my skin because like the ex wife they look past that. I won't let my skin hold me back if people say anything I basically tell them to fuck off.
Psoriasis,fpucur9,t1_fpfllwu,1588909813.0,Yes it would I wish I had the time and $$ to do so. I was planning on going to Guatemala when I got my citizenship but ole covid 19 delay that so I am hoping to get there eventually and the sun and less stress will be a godsend
Psoriasis,fpuaqbc,t1_fptvfap,1588908422.0,I hated giving myself shots but it's quick and easy I highly recommend it. I have tried hummara (not sure on spelling but it did not work out for me. The last one I tried was a pill but all it did was fuck up my stomach and gave me HORRIBLE gi issues and what I did not know was that it causes you to have suicidal thoughts. I am also bipolar and that shit did not agree with me.
Psoriasis,fptt3zp,t3_gfiixn,1588897726.0,It sux big time! I feel for you I use a cortisone cream and it usually clears up. But before I would use what ever the doctor gave me the best cream was something with 10% salacilic acid but I don't recommend it cuz that shit burns! The only thing that ever worked for me was embrel it clears up everything with in a few weeks.
Psoriasis,fpfizy1,t1_fpfieo6,1588572711.0,"I have had psoriasis since I was 16. I have it on 90% of my back and a good percentage of my legs and upper arms.  I have tried multiple topical meds and had the best success witha mix of UV treatment at my dermatologist and biologics like embrel at 50 mgs 2x a week.! Stress reduction and uv worked for me when. I spent a week in Hawaii my psoriasis cleared up for about 3 months.  Stress for me is a major trigger for when my psoriasis flares up. Example In the last year I have been 5150d gone through rehab for the second time got divorced so my stress level is through the roof. 
Everyone has different triggers btw"
Psoriasis,fpfgo4u,t3_gd58ir,1588570694.0,"I stopped caring about what people said or think. At least once a week I get some unnecessary comments looks people staring and the ever popular so called ""miracle cure"".. my personal favorite was the woman who suggested I use cigar Ash and garlic to make a paste that. Would not only repel vampires but also cure my psoriasis right up in a few days!  I agree with the first guys comments  if your partner loves you they will accept you for who you are inside and out! If they don't move on and find someone who will.!"
Psoriasis,fpfcdy5,t1_fpfc4vf,1588567214.0,Sunlight and less stress are probably the real reason why your symptoms have been going down.
Psoriasis,fpfaoe0,t3_gd4nav,1588565913.0,"Wow this is really eye opening! Thank you for your insight! I should look for a new dermatologist asap! 
Nevermind that it's an autoimmune disease and hereditary but by all means keep me posted on any new information you come across"
BipolarReddit,fnb8tv6,t3_g0lfsw,1586811239.0,I am sorry for what your going through. I was on the same boat a year and a half ago. When I tried to kill my self my spouse divorced me on the way to the hospital! Bleeding out on the car ride to the hospital the one person I have ever! Says she can't handle it and while I was in an inpatient treatment facility for dual diagnosis. I get handed divorce papers! Please be mindful of the baby and again I am sorry for what your going through
horrorlit,fmrk1tb,t3_fwljdo,1586325601.0,I did not care for this book at all. I really thought it would be more than what you said of Lord of the flies but with scouts and it did not live up to anything. I gave the deep a shot as well and was not impressed at all.
BipolarReddit,fmrjjrh,t3_fwvlil,1586325149.0,First of all happy birthday! I  have been severally depressed and I am on the same boat with little to no friends. My marriage of 18 years ended the day I tried to kill my self and  was 5150d then sent to rehab for addiction and being bipolar for about a month.i had to move in to my mom's living room and lucky I got my job back that I love. I have been self harming for over 4 months due to issues with pay at work but I am getting paid more now to do the same job. I am sorry for what your going through but please know that I love what you said I feel the same way. Happy birthday and if you need a bipolar friend on the west coast I am here for you..
Psoriasis,fme0yhw,t3_fu9qmz,1585984916.0,My tattoo for fucked up too from psoriasis it sucks I have a small piece on my thigh and part of it came off when I had some on it. The cream I had at the time cleared it up but you can see a chunk of it missing.
Psoriasis,fm363zb,t1_fm1naab,1585713856.0,I did not have a biopsy to determine if I had psoriasis or not I am sorry I was not clear about that. I remember freaking out because I was 17 and had it on my genitals thought it was something else and the Dr looked at it and said it's psoriasis. I have horrible flare ups when I am stressed out and the pandemic is not helping. I am fourtun and currently my back is the worse
Psoriasis,fm1mhs1,t1_fm1lyy9,1585681105.0,Why did you have a biopsy? I have had psoriasis since I was 17 and I have it everywhere the guy was asking if it moves around from one place to another and it does not yes some places are worse than others I know that I was giving him an example! currently have it on a hudge percentage of my body as well. And it's HORRIBLE on my back and legs. I was on embrel for years and it went away then I became immune to it and tried hummara that did not work out last meds I tried was the pill and all that did was f up my stomach.
Psoriasis,fm0uvet,t1_fm0qdl7,1585666627.0,It's not going to move around you will get on your knees elbows and back. Your mom probably had ezema and those will clear up with some topical steroids like cortisone cream. there are no test the dermatologist can give you they won't take a sample and send it to the lab the Dr will look at it and prescibe you a topical cream and worst case scenario a biologic.in the mean time look for Dr Sheffields psoriasis cream it comes in a red and white tube and can be found at the dollar store. Or dollartree.com they can ship you a case of it. I have been using that and it works really well because it has salacilic don't know the spelling sorry
Psoriasis,fm0ptam,t3_fsc9jq,1585663716.0,I have had psoriasis since  I was about 18 years and I. 42 now. you have an autoimmune disease that is usually from genetics. The percentage of affected areas of the body depends on the severance. I have it about 60% of my body and it sucks. I have been perscibed pretty much any and all topical meds. Done light treatment and taken two types of biologics. The best advice I can offer you is when you have the opportunity to visit the dermatologist it will clear up any questions or issues that you may have.
Psoriasis,fl922yq,t3_fndlfs,1584938561.0,Its REALLY REALLY hard for me to get sick. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease and makes your immune systems hyper active. Yes the scales and itchiness suck but I have no fear from the corona virus. Yes people with compromised immune systems and the elderly are more at risk. I worry about my mom due to her age  and  my ex wife who has lupus is at risk.
AskReddit,fl5tc7r,t3_fmnu1a,1584845180.0,I am male and recently became single but I stopped caring about what people think about me a LONG time ago. As a delivery driver for FedEx good looking  women are always smiling and talking to me and generally happy to see me

BipolarReddit,ey1vxk5,t3_cv34lu,1566713456.0,Hand raised high here i used to self medicate to balance my self out problem came when i became severely addicted. A little but turned into a lot more and hours turned into days. The drugs were not enough because what made things worse when my tolerance was so high that the high from dope would only last for about 20 to 30 min. This made me crazy when The worst part was crippling depression that came about 2 to 3 days later when my serotonin levels would be more fucked up. I battled addiction for years and currently struggling staying clean its a fucking one man battle everyday staying sober. Long story short fellow polars DON'T DO DRUGS ITS NOT WORTH IT.
