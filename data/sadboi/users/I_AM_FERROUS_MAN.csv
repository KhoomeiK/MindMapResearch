learnmath,fqvxrva,t3_gl4jvi,1589687620.0,"I'm glad you're reaching out for help. That indicates that you're taking steps to try to address what you see as a stumbling block. And I think that is a great first step.

However, I will say that I don't think it is likely that anyone that comments here will be able to offer you a silver bullet. I'm familiar with the struggles you've described because I used to tutor a bit when I was younger. The pattern of steps that it takes to solve math problems come more easily to some and a lot less easily to many others.

My first piece of advice is that you should look for some support from people in your life. Learning can be made much easier when you have someone to work with. Granted as someone in my 30's too, I know how hard an ask that might be.

My second bit of advice is to consider asking your doctor if there's any option to be evaluated for a behavioral disorder or learning disability. Finding out if you happen to have one can really help you find the right resources to overcome it. So many adults don't realize that they didn't pursue certain skill sets because it was truly harder for them to pick up. I was in freaking engineering college before I was evaluated and determined to have one. It was liberating to realize I wasn't just stupid or lazy. I just needed more time to do an excellent job.

Third piece of advice. Do a lot of Googling and try a bunch of things. There's so many more resources out there for learning than ever before. YouTube videos, community college, local study groups, online classes, books, libraries, community centers, and many state colleges offer free or minimal cost adult classes. Just don't get discouraged if whatever you try first doesn't immediately work. Just move on to the next thing. Here's some potential resources I found with a quick glance:

SciFiConcepts,fqdf6n1,t3_gi2h81,1589288310.0,"So: 

1) It's not the best idea to ""blow up"" a potential impactor be it asteroid or planet.

2) For any sufficiently large object to threaten the earth with an extinction level event, you're going to need to intercept the object way, way early on to have any hope. For something as large as a planet that is even more true and we're talking decades.

3) IMO, sci-fi stories typically break down typically 2 ways: A) Characters struggling against an external challenge that requires banding together as a team to overcome, B) Characters struggling with each other to do the obvious thing. I personally prefer A type stories (The Martian, Apollo 13, Alien, Star Trek, etc) because I gravitate towards liking characters that are compotent and level headed, especially in something as high stakes as this scenario. If you go with B type (which it sounds like your story is currently headed towards), then I think you run the risk of making either your antagonist or protagonists seem like fools with the wrong priorities.

Those more powerful societies end up circulating those connotations around the symbol faster than the original group. So whole cultures can be reduced to a charicature around the world without getting any voice to provide context.

Just look at any indigenous peoples in the Americas or any of the other colonies that were established by European powers. Their cultures were portrayed as savages and their cultural symbols turned into exoticisms for the Western world's imaginations and fancy.

Sure the original meaning and the appropriated ones can coexist for some time. But inherent to the imbalance of the relationship between the cultures, history has a better chance to remember the symbol with the charicatured symbolism."

spinabifida,fomlezr,t3_g88w9n,1587894452.0,"Hi, I'm a 30+ yo male born with mylomeningecel at the L5 S1 location. My Spina Bifida is very mild and I largely pass as an adult without disability. To start with your questions:

1) I have a mild Chiari Malformation. It didn't affect me much as far as I can tell. Only sign I ever had it was some neck stiffness and head pain prior to my tethered cord surgery as a teen.

2) I've never had a shunt. Only mild hydrocephalus that never caused me issues.

3) I've catheterized 4-5 a day since 7ish. It definitely was a bit scary as a child the first couple times. Granted I know most children want to stay in diapers no matter what. Lol. But once my nurse and parents showed me how to do it a couple times it became no big deal. The ""pain"" of the first times are really more just fear of the unknown of putting something into your body in an un natural way. Now I don't even think about it. It's just going to the bathroom. Absolutely no pain.

Some other info about me. As mentioned, I'm very fortunate with a mild version. I have bladder and bowel incontinence, which was more difficult when I was young. But became easier to control as I grew up and embraced making good habits. It's a lot more responsibility for a kid (and his parents), but accepting it and taking 1 day at a time helps a lot. I take medicine daily to help my bladder incontinence as I have a loose sphincter and overactive bladder treated with Sudafed and Oxybutenin respectively. I'm also happy to say that I got through all the tough parts of young life in one piece, got my Bachelor's and Master's in Engineering, and have a long and happy relationship with my college sweetheart. Of course, I can't promise that it'll be the same outcome, but the lower in the spine the better the outcome tends to be.

So some other details and advice that has worked for me or something I wish I would have done better at:

1) Get to know your closest Children's Hospital. They have superb staff and gave me yearly checkups with a ton of specialists (Neurology, Orthopedic, Urology, Psychiatry, etc.). This really helped my parents and I to navigate this world. Plus it got me used to having a positive association with hospitals.

2) Get to know the SBAA (Spina Bifida Association of America). They have tons of great resources, info, and support for families.

3) Be ready for the confusing and frustrating navigation of diet and fiber intake to combat bowel incontinence. I wish I had discovered that eating frozen quart bags of fruit everyday was my best option. But I tried pills, diet, metamucil, and all kinds of other stuff that was unreliable or inconvenient until I happened on this idea. Then boom I've never been more regular. My intestines are just slow and so I would cycle about every 1 to 2 weeks from constipation to diarrhea. As a teen this was the hardest thing to deal with.

4) It will be likely that as a teen during a growth spurt you'll have to do what is called a ""tethered cord"" surgery. I did it at 14 because it was causing me neck pain and worsening my scoliosis. The procedure went great, but it took 10 days in the hospital to recover. And for the first 3 days the head pain was the worst pain of my entire life and I have a well practiced pain scale. But it passes and is well worth the results.

5) As your child gets older they will have to work on accepting the responsibility of their health. This becomes hard as a teen when you want nothing more than to be normal. But more than anything, I wish I had invested more in building my skills around routine, consistency, and exercise. As a parent, I think this is one thing you can really help your child to do over the long run and by setting a good example. My parents did an amazing job. But I still wish I had done even more. As an adult, being consistent is more important than anything and I wish I understood that sooner.

6) Tied into the advice above diet and exercise are pivotal. It is easy to get obesse with slow digestion and barriers to exercise or feeling like not being good at sports or avoiding activity for fear of bowel issues.

7) It took me far, far too long to realize I suffered from mental health issues. My apptitude, intelligence, and responsible nature covered up my symptoms when I was younger. Plus being a teenager is, of course, very emotional. But looking back on things, I realize now that I should have been leveraging the psychiatric resources that were available to me. It was only in college that I started to think my depression/mania episodes might be bipolar disorder and not just a natural ebb and flow of mood or concentration. I take medicines for it now and really really wish I had started sooner. They help so incredibly much. I'm certain I could've been a better student with them. Or at least minimized my stress. I would suggest just always having a psychiatrist visit be a part of their lives growing up. It would be best to normalize this kind of resource. I think I just, unfortunately, grew up in an era 90's where psychiatry and medicine for mental disorders were still stigmatized. So it wasn't a natural conclusion to jump to until my life started to feel like it was slipping out of my control. Luckily I had an awesome urologist who I felt open to talk to these feelings about and he immediately recognized that it was some form of depression stemming from my Spina Bifida. Just legitimizing it is all it took for me to start addressing it and I'm so glad that I have.

8) Get in the habit of collecting all the information and reports that will go into their medical file. Keep records for yourself of everything. This helps with any changes in insurance, docs, schools, you name it. I have one that takes up two filing cabinets and took me months to digitize. But I did and it has helped me greatly.

I think those are most of the highlights I can think of for now. Please feel free to dm me if you want more thoughts or advice."

It's kind of interesting to see the physics play out. The trucker hits the breaks of the truck and begins to slow down the load. At some point the force from acceleration overcomes the friction holding the load in place. As soon as the load starts sliding the force the load is imparting to the truck decreases dramatically (static friction is higher than kinetic friction) and so the trucks breaks suddenly do a better job of stopping the truck because they feel less pushing force from the load. This only makes things worse as the truck is now stationary while the pipes slide without losing momentum.


Just a lighter touch on the breaks or a better connection of the load to the truck bed could've stopped what happened. Heck even just butting the pipes up against the vertical headache rack on the front of the trailer would've helped stop the pipes from picking up so much speed before encountering a barrier. So many ways this setup could've been safer."

nonmonogamy,fo1et70,t3_g51khl,1587431742.0,"I'm sorry this is happening to you. 

First, I think your husband is really and completely at fault here for not telling you before committing to the relationship. That is well understood to be a HUGE mistake in the poly community. People committing to relationships should go into them with eyes open. So I wanted to convey this because it is likely that this relationship won't work out, but you should know that you aren't to blame for that outcome. I would go so far as to say that your husband doesn't sound polyamorous. It sounds like he's trying to use and abuse your feelings and attachment to him to get what he wants (tacit approval to cheat). Just remember no matter what happens that you aren't a fool. Don't be ashamed. You were lied to or the truth was hidden from you.

Second, most people in the Poly community understand that a huge number of people are fundamentally monogamous. And there is nothing wrong with that. Being Mono is as valid as being poly. Just like being straight is as valid a sexual orientation as gay, bi, etc. People are people and will have varying comfort levels and desires. So, if you feel confident in who you are, there's no amount of experimenting that will change that. It might only hurt you.

Third, if he keeps pushing this without respecting the boundaries you want to establish to be comfortable, then this means he doesn't respect you as a partner. There's no amount of compromise that can fix that. if that happens, then your only choices are to leave or continue to enable an abusive relationship. If for whatever reason, the latter happens, just please avoid bringing children into the picture.

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh or stark. It's just if you hang around the poly and non-monog subreddits, you'll see that behavior like you're describing your husband doing fits a pattern that usually ends up bad and the abuser usually just uses ""Poly"" label as an excuse for their shitty, unethical, and cowardly behavior.

I hope this isn't the case for you. Or if it is, that this point in the relationship is a wake up call before you have to endure any more pain.

Good luck OP. I hope I'm wrong.

Edit: Oh and look into teleconferencing with a counselor. I'm seeing all of my current doctors through online portals that they are setting up. Therapy and counseling is easily the most appropriate of medical appointments to do over the web.

Edit2: Link to an article describing how emotional abusers will act good to get you into a relationship, but will slowly test the waters to see how much power they can have over a partner:

writing,fnk4min,t3_g20xsm,1587014824.0,"Most of the answers here are talking about people just being mean or getting off on tearing things down.

I'd like to offer a different perspective. The works I tend to criticize most strongly are:

1)The ones where something was done really well (a great premise, good dialogue, great character, good plot, etc.), but is overall let down by the rest of the storytelling. As an audience member, it can be infuriating to read through a work that weighs down it's good ideas with it's bad.

2)The ones that are loved by most others, but for whatever reason don't resonate with me. In this case, it usually makes me question if I'm missing something obvious or if others are just more easily pleased. Either way, it can feel like your forced to defend yourself when, you don't like something that others universally love.

Edit: Reread your post and I'm not sure I answered the right question, but I'll leave it up in case it is helpful.

If your question is more, ""why do people criticize authors for starting their material off of online communities?"", then I would answer with the fact that many historically famous stories and creators were considered low brow and pulpy material at their time. Shakespeare, Asimov, Heinlein, HG Wells, Dumas, Dickens, and countless other famous storytellers were not seen as respectable in their time and only came to be loved after history polished away the context."
Futurology,fnk2wvr,t3_g1zgm5,1587013404.0,"As someone in the industry... uh not so much actually. Robots are primarily used in the Automotive sector, which is experiencing a huge downturn at the moment. They are not going to invest at a time like this. And the companies that are developing the tech are going to see their venture capital dry up.

Cut deep enough and the only automation will be in the consumer space like Tesla, Google, and Amazon."

Went to it with college friends. Thought it would be a fun noir super hero. Instead just got the **worst** dialogue and plot I have ever heard brought to screen. I was actually putting my fingers in my ears. The only scene that was worth anything was seeing Samuel L. Jackson react to a CGI flopping foot. Otherwise, every other scene that I actually saw could just be set fire to.

I didn't want to disturb my friends watch of the movie so I sat through way more than I should have. Eventually, I excused myself and hungout in the arcade in the theater until the movie was over. It's the only film I've ever walked out on. And I saw the theatrical release of Ultraviolet. But at least that movie was laughably bad."
