Daca esti complet nestiutor, as recomanda sa te familiarizezi cu termenii des folositi in discutiile politice, inainte de a explora ideologii. Pentru ele iti recomand Wikipedia. Incearca sa abordezi totul cu o minte deschisa, lipsita de prejudecati, pentru ca oricum ce ai auzit pana acum e foarte probabil sa fie fals. Incepe cu capitalism, socialism, comunism, nationalism, libertarianism, progresivism etc. (daca reusesti sa intelegi acesti termeni esti imediat mai cunoscator ca majoritatea :)). De asemenea, poti incepe si aici, chiar pe reddit. Exista multe subreddituri destinate intrebarilor in privinta anumitor ideologii. 

E greu sa iti ofer o recomandare obiectiva, dar ai putea incepe cu Manifestul Comunist de Karl Marx si Friedrich Engels. Il gasesti pe internet sub format pdf gratis. E relativ scurt. 

Daca ai intrebari, imi poti trimite mesaje si am sa incerc sa iti raspund."
Romania,fovvq61,t1_fovujcj,1588108355.0,">Sa discuti despre ideologii politice este extrem de plictisitor.

Tine de opinie si de persoana cu care le discuti. 

Discutia ba din contra, duce la actiune. Ceea ce nu va schimba nimic in mod semnificativ e mentalitatea ca nu mai exista alte idei si concepte in afara celor sustinute de partidele dim tara ta. Trebuie sa recunosc ca ma intristeaza faptul ca romanii refuza sa mai puna intrebari de genul ""de ce?"" si devin intr-o secunda ostili fata de cei care o fac.

99,9% sunt apolitici care nu au nici bazele teoriei politice, dar ei stiu destul incat sa spuna cu incredere ca ideologiile in sine nu conteaza si ca e inutil sa te educi im privinta lor.

The thing is that over here, it's not as easy as a simple walk in and out. They don't give out prescriptions so liberally. It's not a huge deal though, i can get various stuff from different sources. 

It's just that i've been considering therapy for ADHD (if i have it, i'm pretty sure i do) and a script for some stimulant because a trained professional would be better than me at calculating the dose and judging what's the best treatment, or so I would imagine at least."

1. Try to deal with it like i did until now and self-medicate.

2. Get an actual diagnosis and a prescription. Which would be more expensive, but proper therapy alongside medication might help too so idk. 

And the only reason i asked about ASPD is because someone on here claimed that they got diagnosed without them realizing, because they went to a psychologist because of nightmares or something. I mean i kinda doubt it's legit because i doubt there's any correlation between the two and i feel like the questions for an ASPD diagnosis are specific enough for you to recognize, considering the diagnosis criteria provided by the DSM-5.
