I hope you are getting the help you need. 

""How do you guys deal with this?""

I am focussing on myself right now. I need to take better care of myself, but the quarantine is a good time for me to do this. I remember that I am not others and life does not work on my timeline other, but if I get to the right place, it's better than ending up in the wrong one and getting stuck there. I am focussing on what are my struggles, what are my solutions, and then sorting out my goals, and getting help with identifying some of these. Even if getting help is hard or slow, it's worth it and will move you forward in life-give yourself time to do this because you are worth it-we/others know you are worth it even if you forget it sometimes.

   1. Example 1. In one video, the lady scraped peeling parts away to cleanup her holes, then wiped with non-acetone nail polish, then used filler. (surface had a large whole in the top layer)
   2. Example 2. In another, a guy used a leather cleaner, then scraped, then sanded, then sanded before using filler. (example was cracked leather)
3. I think what I want to do is wipe to clean, peel loose bits, sand edges, use filler, dry, and then paint.

Yes, a non-Lutheran Trinitarian baptism will be enough when you join an LCMS church. Also, you are saved by the Word of God that can then lead you to be baptized, not just saved by the sprinkling of baptism as an infant (there are two ways to come to Christ's salvation). Perhaps it's not even those who have been baptized with water that are clothed in Christ but that all regardless of race or gender, Jew or Gentile, but all who are in Christ who are clothed in Him."

I want to add a note on this and please forgive me if I read anything wrong ""And because I'm not baptized, I feel I'm not saved, and because of that I feel anxious, and because of that anxious feeling I turn to sin.""  There is nothing and no one that can separate you from the love of God. Your desire to be baptized reflects your love for God. Though we are imperfect in this mortal form, our imperfect selves love God because He first loved us. You are already his beloved child. God knows your heart and your desire to be baptized. He is merciful. As someone old enough to decide that you want to be baptized, your faith and desire to be baptized in accordance to scripture matter more than the opportunity because they are what make the action and the pouring of water matter. I have no doubt that God is rejoicing in your and preparing you for for a good work. Take heart, ""whosoever believes in Him shall not perish."" I imagine God is pleased with the fact that you want to honor your dad by including him. Honoring our parents was between not having idols and not murdering. Even in this, the Spirit is with you. The Holy Spirit will help you with the opportunity and the words to say. I find Luke 12:11-12 comforting at times.

The peace of God be with you. He will give you the right time and the right words to say. He knows what He is doing and He knows your desire. Lord, let it be so soon for Theserviceofhishonor. Amen."
medical,fqajuhn,t3_ghjv8g,1589220292.0,"Even without GERD, you can have acid reflux from diet that causes a cough. I've had heard gastroenterologist (and this didn't make sense but it worked) suggest an IBS diet instead of a GERD diet for someone whose diet had changed to more raw fruits and veggies, somewhat increased fiber, and either low carb or vegetarian lunches. More of an IBS diet (with less raw fruits and veggies) and a few more hamburgers instead helped. The IBS explanation did not make a lot of sense given where in the digestive system that symptoms occurred, but it worked and reduced the cough.

Have you had an endoscopy? This might be helpful for ruling out causes of stomach symptoms to allergy, anxiety or other non-stomach causes.

Have you had any impact in different allergies? I know someone with a seasonal response to antihistamines to lessen nasal symptoms that occur whether inside or outside when the pollen is out and that did not show up on an allergy test. Do you have any impact on antihistamines? I have been told that you can add a Benedryl (diphenhydramine) to Claritin, Allegra, or Zyrtec and tried adding with no noticeable side effects beyond already being sick with a nasty cold. I knew someone who took accidentally took a second dose of antihistamine and finally had a clear nose. If you have any nasal symptoms, perhaps it is worth adding Benedryl or talking to a doctor about antihistamines.

I use them (and love them) for other cleaning things though-they do a great job on grime I need to wipe off and smell nice (and healthier if I am handling them a lot). Is there something that tells me I can trust them to help with the SARS-CoV-2 virus?

I honestly do not know much about essential oils. What I do know is that my wipes from another brand that uses Thymol was listed on the bottle as disinfectant wipes and it was EPA registered. That company listed on their websites that they had submitted a request for EPA emerging pathogens certification a few weeks ago. It is now on the list. If the wipes that use essential oils are not EPA registered disinfectants, is there anyone who we can trust to tell us if these do disinfect or sanitize for SARS-CoV-2?

I was looking at cleaning products on the EPA list last week because I had not yet seen my other wipes approved. There are a lot of brands and products besides Clorox and Lysol that are on the list. As regular consumers who do not buy for businesses, we aren't necessarily exposed to the breadth of products that are out there.
