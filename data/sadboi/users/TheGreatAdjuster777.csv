The presentation as a whole, voice acting, characters, writing etc were all VERY well done but actually PLAYING it was one of the most tedious experiences I’ve had in gaming.

And I’m speaking as someone who didn’t grow up with a lot of these old consoles but sought them out later thinking “gee there sure are a lot of interesting games on these old consoles”. Like you could probabbbbly buy a ps2/ps1, a copy of ff7, AND a crt to play it the right way for cheaper than the $60 this upcoming ff7 remake is going to cost."

But if you didn’t know that somehow, how do you close menus in most Switch games..? The B button.. And the game says “b button” to close on the dialog box... So hmmm, if b closes the prompts, let’s see what happens when I just hold b down? And then when you notice the prompts aren’t popping up now that you’re holding B, voila  mystery solved"
