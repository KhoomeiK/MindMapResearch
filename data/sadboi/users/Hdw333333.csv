I live alone and already live a pretty lonely life, two weeks without seeing another person or leaving my house has been very damaging on my already suffering mental health, and all the reports are saying it'll go on a lot longer. Should I get over it? Of course, there's nothing I can do about it and we're all in this together. But should I not be able to even talk about it to my friends? That seems unfair. If you were my friend, I would be even more frustrated and feel even more isolated if you shut my venting down because- I have no room to talk when others are making such huge sacrifices. Just because my sacrifices aren't nearly as important or risky, doesn't mean they aren't still hard. I could be out visiting people every day, but I'm not, which IS a sacrifice, however small. I'm doing my part even if it's harmful to my mental health. Both things can be true at the same time, and I don't think we should be villainizing people for being upset for being stuck at home."

This is coming from someone who has Bipolar disorder. As someone with this disease, this was the first time since they introduced this storyline that I've felt it was depicted well, both from Deluca's perspective and the people around him's reactions."
AskReddit,fkqdduz,t1_fkqbw8g,1584441454.0,"I never said treatment is the same as a cure. Mental illness is treatable, not curable. Cancer is treatable not curable. Methadone is a medication used to TREAT drug addiction. 

I didn't downplay addiction as an illness in any way (as you comment implies I did); my best friend is a recovering addict who has been sober for 10 years, she still fights her disease every day and I wholly support her in every step of her treatment journey. I was saying that the person who implied that ""using methadone"" is nefarious/ equal to ""doing drugs"" is either misinformed about what methadone is and does or is lying (I believe it's the latter)."

Maybe when after we eat/ tomorrow. Love you!"". Seems like he could ""avoid easily in passing (helping his mom)"" with this simple statement..."

AskReddit,fkq9o6p,t1_fkq72op,1584436656.0,"Thank you! I'm sitting here thinking, ""she was secretly treating her addiction with a prescription medication that literally disables the high of real drugs""? Methadone is treatment for drug addiction people, this answer is bs; especially with the dramatic ending line of ""where they are now is even more sad, but I cant bring myself to dive into that""."
AskReddit,fkpnsrm,t1_fkoylcp,1584414606.0,"I bought a used WiiU right before the switch came out for like $100 specifically to play Ocarina of Time. Now I also have Breath of the Wild, Mario Cart, Super Smash Brothers, and all the Donkey Kong Country games from Super Nintendo, and I'm thrilled! For what's it's worth, I actually love the system, it gets a lot of hate, but it's perfect for me and was cheap."
UpliftingNews,fkpa0cz,t1_fkp76sq,1584405192.0,"They have 3 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, a huge backyard and the garage. They have 5 people living there (two parents, their two kids and the dad's brother). I have a studio size room with my bed, kitchen, and small dining room table all in the same room, a small living room area, a small bathroom, a tiny back yard, a tiny patio, and I park my car on the side of the driveway (not in front of the two car garage, in front of the side fence). I'm charging slightly less than the going rate for a 3 bedroom 2.5 bathroom house in my area and pay ALL the utilities (including internet). I'm not exploiting anyone, they're getting a great deal and so am I, but thanks for your judgment."
UpliftingNews,fkojfni,t1_fkois2x,1584388425.0,"Thank you, it's been working out really well so far. I hired a property management company to find and manage the tenants so I wouldn't have to deal with it. The sides are completely separate, the small side is like a one bedroom with its own kitchen, full bathroom, washer/ dryer, patio and separate back yard. The only thing we share is the driveway. I would never rent to a friend/ family, I learned that lesson when I hired a friend to work for me and I had to fire her for stealing...."
specializedtools,fkoh8up,t1_fko9k89,1584387176.0,"Agreed. The reason I love my air fryer is I can just throw everything in there, push start, and 20 minutes later my food is done (with the occasional stop and shake or stop and add an additional ingredient). While it's cooking, I clean everything I used to prep the food, and I'm done with all that by the time I get to eat!"
UpliftingNews,fkogjt0,t1_fko6cu7,1584386782.0,"Same with me. I rent the other side of my house which pays for the majority of my mortgage. I set it up that way when choosing a home so I could buy a bigger, better house that I'll hopefully be able to afford fully by myself one day, but that I can always rent the other side (or the smaller side that I live in currently) if I want/ need extra money. I would be screwed if my tenants stopped paying rent for more than a month or two. Maybe that's my fault for owning a home I can't fully afford, but it seemed like a great idea when I bought the house; I live near a college, there's always students looking for housing, so it seemed like a pretty safe bet that I'd always be able to find tenants. But if the tenants I have can't pay their rent and I can't evict them.... that could pose a huge problem."
