CasualConversation,fqy1lj6,t1_fqxrqnz,1589741113.0,Oh boy those are a lot of details for a beginner haha. But I think I get what you mean. For now a low-mid budget setup would consist of a stratocaster and a voxx combo amp for that crispy Queen sound right?
CasualConversation,fqy19j8,t1_fqxrgws,1589740968.0,Eyyy! Happy birthday indigo! How old are you now?
CasualConversation,fqxqusn,t1_fqxn56m,1589736462.0,"Oh boy that is one hell of a rollercoaster. Glad you're finally free man!

So with the stratocasters the difference is largely in budget right? and ill definitely check in with a luthier. I'm really into Queen tbh and I honestly considered purchasing a BMG Red Special but it was a little too expensive for me haha. Kaleo are awesome for sure I love that they don't just stick to a single genre. And ooh I'll check out James Bay thank you!"

The beard part I can understand. I am not christian but I see where you're coming from with that and will try doing it. I'll try castor oil too.

Guitar sounds good. Should I get a teacher or can I learn using Youtube, on my own generally.

So for laziness your advice is to take a break? Like instead of wasting time while stressing about what I have to do I intentionally do nothing without stressing? How do I manage that when I already have a lot to do?

When he was discovered to have special powers, he was still treated with distrust from his peers and masters. Never got what he deserved in terms of praise and that freaking Master title. Had to marry his girlfriend in secret because Jedi prohibited marriage. Saw a vision of her dying during childbirth. Was manipulated by a Sith Lord (Darth Sidious), promising him a way to keep his wife alive. So he turned on his allies. Thinking his best friend turned his wife against him, he choked his aforementioned wife from anger, and had to fight aforementioned (now former) best friend and mentor on a lava planet and be severely mutilated, losing the 3 limbs he had left. Been lied to about how his wife died, being blamed for it and hating himself. Goes through crippling depression throughout most of his cheerful career and lives in a heavy handicapping, yet life supporting metal suit that leaves him weak to force lightning (main weapon of Sidious, now his Master),making it a fact that even from his new master he is distrusted.
