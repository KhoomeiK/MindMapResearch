Anxiety,fnyd3i2,t3_fo6h6w,1587359601.0,"It makes me feel a little bit better knowing im not the only one . Not that i want anyone feeling this way but it calms me down a little knowing its sadly just the anxiety . Yes my neck has been stiff for a few days now and the headache does not go away. We will get through this though, hopefully."
Anxiety,fnv27kt,t1_fldnsc0,1587277842.0,Thank God i thought i was the only one. I have called the doctors office atleast 3 times anxiety really does suck . I feel so bad i make myself get a headache and neck pain. I dont have fever or cough just tightness in chest and shortness of breath. Stress is gonna kill me before coronavirus . Lol
