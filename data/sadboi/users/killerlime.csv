My grandpa, uncle, and brother were all diagnosed with Bipolar 1 so it definitely runs in my family. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was bipolar or not though because I‚Äôve seen my brothers manic episodes and I‚Äôd never had those before. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my freshman year of high school (although I suffered years before being diagnosed) and have tried every antidepressant in the book with no success. I knew there had to be more to it than just being depressed, and when I finally got good insurance after getting married to my husband last year I started therapy for the first time. She recommended I see a psychiatrist as she thought I showed many symptoms of ADD or possibly Bipolar 2. I didn‚Äôt know the difference between Bipolar 1 and 2 so when I started doing more research on it I learned what hypomania was and realized I have gone through what seems like hypomanic episodes in the past. I started tracking my moods with Daylio and started seeing a psychiatrist, and although she told me she doesn‚Äôt want to label me with Bipolar 2 she told me she definetly believes that‚Äôs what I have after seeing me in both depressive states and hypo states. I‚Äôm being treated with Bipolar meds now and can actually tell a difference for the first time in my life. This (not official) diagnosis has changed my life- mostly for the better.
