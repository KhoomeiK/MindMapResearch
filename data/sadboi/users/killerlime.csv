Seeing him in the condition he was in and watching him take his last breathes today was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do and I feel strangely numb right now. Deep down I know there isn’t a right or wrong way to grieve but the way I’m feeling just doesn’t seem right. I think I’m numb. And I know that it’s okay to feel that way. Grieving is weird.

Nanny,ffxkj8n,t3_evonhe,1580327002.0,"I’m currently going through something similar with my NF. 5m is too much for me to handle anymore, his tantrums are unbelievable and I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around him. I work 50-60 hour weeks and am so tired during the week I’m passed out by 9 every night. The only reason I’ve been here for so long (2.5 years) is because of the pay. I finally took the first step and applied for a new job at a daycare/preschool and have an interview next week and it already feels like a huge weight off my shoulders! It’s going to be a big pay cut but it’s also a good opportunity for me career wise because if I get the job they’re going to pay for my associates degree!

I would suggest quitting if the job is that exhausting, for the sake of your mental health! I wish you the best of luck and hope you find something that pays well and puts your mind at ease!"

The only side effects I have from it is for the first couple weeks I was incredibly tired, but that went away. Also it makes me anxious. I’m on anxiety meds now along side it and the anxiety is still awful. I don’t want to go off the Vraylar though because my depression was so awful before this med. if I can just find an anxiety med that works for me then everything will be perfect.

I can see them thinking that this isn’t enough and I need to do more around the house, sadly. I just wish we could talk about it face to face instead of hearing it from their child. I’m probably going to be getting a new job soon anyways so there’s no use bringing it up to them."

bipolar,faeryc7,t3_e8tmja,1576006942.0,"I’ve had suspicions for years now that I was Bipolar but never opened up about them because I wasn’t sure. My grandpa, uncle, and brother were all diagnosed with Bipolar 1 so it definitely runs in my family. I wasn’t sure if I was bipolar or not though because I’ve seen my brothers manic episodes and I’d never had those before. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety my freshman year of high school (although I suffered years before being diagnosed) and have tried every antidepressant in the book with no success. I knew there had to be more to it than just being depressed, and when I finally got good insurance after getting married to my husband last year I started therapy for the first time. She recommended I see a psychiatrist as she thought I showed many symptoms of ADD or possibly Bipolar 2. I didn’t know the difference between Bipolar 1 and 2 so when I started doing more research on it I learned what hypomania was and realized I have gone through what seems like hypomanic episodes in the past. I started tracking my moods with Daylio and started seeing a psychiatrist, and although she told me she doesn’t want to label me with Bipolar 2 she told me she definetly believes that’s what I have after seeing me in both depressive states and hypo states. I’m being treated with Bipolar meds now and can actually tell a difference for the first time in my life. This (not official) diagnosis has changed my life- mostly for the better. Now I’m finally being treated properly and can learn how to cope with my moods and behavior without wondering what the hell is wrong with me."
