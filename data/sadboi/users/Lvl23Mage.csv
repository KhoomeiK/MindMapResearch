bipolar,fr6ontq,t3_gmvwi8,1589930187.0,"I get bad anxiety before my period too. I track my moods daily, so I can see patterns. Plus I track my period too, so I know it’s not an episode. Once my period comes the anxiety, irritability goes away. If my anxiety is really bad, I take my anti-anxiety medicine. Overall it sucks!"
bipolar,fqbqik4,t3_ghzpcq,1589241970.0,"Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, my dr tried cymbalta. It did nothing for me. So I essentially failed that treatment which the dr determined my bp diagnosis. (I did try other antidepressants and they just made things worse)"
BipolarReddit,fqbku9w,t3_ghxcj6,1589238866.0,I take .5mg of Ativan for really bad panic attacks. I actually keep track on how many I take in a month. On average I only take no more than 10 a month. I really don’t want to build a dependency on this.
BipolarReddit,fq7j73z,t1_fq7hl2s,1589147091.0,"It took maybe 3 months for my mood stabilizer to work once it got to the therapeutic level. Then I kept having mixed episodes, so my doctor added an antipsychotic and that worked immediately for me. So I’m at a year with this combination and I mostly feel stable. But everyone is different. What works for one person may not work for another."
BipolarReddit,fq7fma7,t3_gh98xq,1589145756.0,"To my understanding, medicine doesn’t make the episodes go away. In my case, my episodes are so mild that sometimes I barely notice them. It takes time to find the medication that will work best for you."
bipolar,fp0gg8l,t1_fp0fq9v,1588208779.0,"I think if you eat the required amount of calories, it should make you tired."
bipolar,fp0faqk,t3_gakxys,1588208146.0,I take 60mg at night and 20mg in the morning with cogentin. Plus I take a mood stabilizer. The combo works for me. I’m able to lose weight on it (no food cravings). I figured out how/when to take it so I’m not too tired. I’ve been on this combo for almost a year. So far I’m doing great.
bipolar,fo52f2k,t3_g5kq26,1587516053.0,"I take an AP and mood stabilizer and that seems to balance me out. Everyone is different, but I feel good. My episodes are mild,  but I can enjoy things- mildly of course."
BipolarReddit,fmghcec,t1_fmgg56p,1586049078.0,"I found geodon to be really good with weight. I never gained on it. I don’t have food cravings either. I lost 40+lbs on it. I was an emotional eater. With the smoothie I take, I know it’s nowhere near the calorie requirement but it works for me. My psych once told me that I was sensitive to the medications."
BipolarReddit,fmgf8eg,t3_fv45gm,1586047703.0,I take 60mg at night around 8:30pm so around 11:30-12 I get tired. In the morning I take 20mg. For the mornings I play around with what I eat. I found drinking a protein smoothie doesn’t make me fall asleep. It’s sucks that you have to take it with so many calories. But this method has been working for me. I’m also on cogentin in the morning and lamictal at night. I want to say the sedation has gotten a little better. I’ve been on this combo for 9 months and it’s working very well for me.
BipolarReddit,fm0zmd2,t3_fsar7e,1585669260.0,"With my first daughter I noticed that I was really emotional. Then when I got pregnant for the second time, I was actually depressed during the pregnancy. Once she was born, I was diagnosed as postpartum depression.  It took 2 years to get  BP 2 diagnosis. So yes, in my case, pregnancy makes bp worse. However, I would do it again- I love these adorable stress makers. Lol"
BipolarReddit,fk26om5,t3_fg103p,1583794293.0,I couldn’t agree more. Sometimes I feel every mood and then some months I have no symptoms. I wish my body would make up its mind.
bipolar2,fi2m05m,t3_f64a3b,1582082914.0,"I’ve been there. I hated the thought of medication. However I gave them time to work and I got better. Yes I still have episodes but it’s not as intense. I’ve made peace with medication. I can work, take care of my kids, have a healthy relationship with my husband and I’m happy. Give it time."
BipolarReddit,fi2l5c9,t3_f60z0y,1582082323.0,I take cogentin with geodon. I don’t know of any side effects. I’d say it kicks in within an hour. No idea really. But I don’t experience akathisia anymore.
bipolar2,fhr4wzr,t3_f4itfk,1581817458.0,"My depression drastically decreased on lamictal. Most episodes I can barely tell it’s there. However, I would still experience really bad mixed episodes. My pdoc added an antipsychotic and that seems to have done the trick. Oh I’m also on 200mg for over a year now."
bipolar2,fhgo4i8,t3_f342z5,1581572853.0,I actually have this book. I never finished it but I found it to be useful. I liked some of the positive sayings during depressive episodes. The worksheets are good too. I basically jumped to chapters that I could relate to.
bipolar,fh8757t,t3_f1ss6t,1581353506.0,I don’t know of medications that are low risk for akathisia. But my pdoc prescribes me congentin  to combat akathisia. Maybe bring this up?
bipolar2,fguk8ug,t3_f0f30l,1581122889.0,I’m not crying.. it’s allergies
bipolar2,fgrk6of,t3_f03t8r,1581048910.0,"Where I’m from, electronic scripts are the norm. They have been for years. I prefer it that way, zero chance of losing the prescription. It goes straight to the pharmacy so by the time I get to the pharmacy my medication is ready to be picked up."
bipolar,fgrj995,t3_f03c9g,1581048215.0,"My co-pay is $70 to see the psych and for each therapy session. I used to go to therapy twice a month. I can’t afford it, so I stopped therapy. Granted they can do a payment plan, but that means I’ll always be behind."
bipolar2,ff5gjuw,t1_ff5fvw0,1579591902.0,Thank you so much for your replies!
bipolar2,ff5fot4,t1_ff5ff4a,1579590838.0,I stopped therapy and now I think that was a mistake. I’m afraid of talking to other friends / family about my struggles. I thought about joining a bp support group.
bipolar2,ff5fje6,t1_ff5bgwa,1579590655.0,Exactly. I wish I knew how to change this cycle.
bipolar2,ff5fcjc,t1_ff5essc,1579590429.0,My husband really does try. I try not to burden my friend that’s in a similar situation. This whole thing just sucks. I can’t sleep either.
BipolarReddit,fbwk243,t3_eeryyy,1577151995.0,"When I took geodon at lower doses I had akathisia. So my dr added cogentin and that helped a lot. I now take 60mg at night and 20mg in the morning. Paring this medication with a mood stabilizer has been my perfect combo. It’s not 100% perfect, due to the sedation at times."
BipolarReddit,f7czk41,t3_dvhoym,1573603794.0,I didn’t know I had bp when I had my two kids. But after my second I knew something wasn’t right with me.  Symptoms were intense. But now that I have the proper diagnosis and the right care I’m doing well. Bp runs in my family so there’s a chance my kids might get it. But I hope not.
BipolarReddit,f76thpg,t3_dukad3,1573435367.0,I work 40-50 hours a week at a desk job and I teach. I know my memory is crap so I usually write down what I’m supposed to do. This has been working well for me.
bipolar2,f6xgz9f,t1_f6xgisi,1573249373.0,I take geodon 20mg morning. lamictal 200mg and geodon 60mg at night.
bipolar2,f6xeoqy,t3_dtjuer,1573248064.0,Yea that used to happen to me. I told my pdoc and he prescribed medication for me to take in the morning. Sucks but it worked out well for me.
bipolar,f6v8a3b,t3_dt8gse,1573179234.0,I take an antipsychotic and mood stabilizer. So far working like a charm.
theyknew,f6v80zs,t3_dt7nqt,1573179046.0,I actually have that and got mine for free.
bipolar,f6uzp1l,t3_dt5j8n,1573172746.0,"I’m on the same med. I had an abnormal ekg too. Saw the cardiologist and my heart is fine. I have a non threatening congenital heart defect. So it was luck that my pdoc found the abnormal ekg. 
So hopefully it’s nothing for you too."
bipolar2,f6qxm0n,t3_dsodi7,1573088549.0,"I noticed skin changes with my medication, however I’m stable, I can function and I feel like a person.  For my skin I make sure to wash it 2x a day, use facial masks and moisturizer. I think most medications come with some type of side effect. I wish you luck in finding one that works well for you."
bipolar2,f6h55m4,t3_drauoq,1572837279.0,"I set reminders on my phone when I need to take my medication. So I have 3 reminders- morning , around dinner and before bed."
bipolar2,f68d2fi,t3_dqq2rd,1572727601.0,I’ve been on 200mg for a year now. My depression is extremely mild. I don’t even realize it most of the time. I also take an antipsychotic and the two medications are the perfect mix for me.
bipolar2,f687gsj,t3_dqpa5e,1572726181.0,"From my understanding, and I could be incorrect. But hypomania has to last a few days in order to be hypomania. You could have had an elevated mood. I go through that. But for hypomania I look for other symptoms such as increased irritability, anxiety, feeling amazing, less need for sleep etc"
bipolar,f3vbv40,t3_diat1f,1571174063.0,For me it’s hard to say. Last month was so freaking horrible and this month I was totally fine. I wish my symptoms would be consistent.
bipolar2,f3ssf4a,t3_di0at0,1571108323.0,"I’m pretty sure I’ve achieved stability. I feel calmer and happier. I take geodon and lamictal. I no longer stress eat, my appetite is actually good. I’ve lost 40 pounds since last year! I’ve restricted my carb intake and I workout."
bipolar,f3a2x6w,t3_dg7vmq,1570760548.0,"I used to have a fish tank and I had guppies. Great times! There’s just something so calming about fish. Maybe it’s the sound of water? 

I’m happy that you’re enjoying them."
bipolar2,f36ndta,t3_dfwuiq,1570714843.0,"I was voluntarily committed. If I hadn’t I don’t think I would be alive. So going in I wasn’t thinking of pricing. I just needed to get better. The staff and doctors were really nice and they helped it during my lowest. 

My insurance covered a bulk of it but I was left with about $5,000 to pay out of pocket. I was able to claim financial hardship and the hospital reduced my bill to about $1,500 or so. I make monthly payments and I should have it completed within 18 months."
bipolar2,f22q0hh,t3_dbh1o3,1569894233.0,I had akathisia with low dose of geodon. My pdoc prescribed cogentin. That got rid of it for me. I hope you find a solution.
BipolarReddit,ey7bsh7,t3_cvy4s2,1566877653.0,"It happen to me. Sucks really, I have two small kids so the sensory overload gets to me badly."
bipolar2,ewq2hrl,t3_cpfpww,1565655214.0,I was on 5mg once a day at night. It would make me sleepy so I didn’t mind the tongue going numb. I went straight to bed. Maybe after two weeks I didn’t mind the taste and the numbness. I’m sorry it’s not working for you. I started it while going through a horrible mixed episode. I swear it stopped that mess right in its tracks. I felt normal on saphris and my mood stabilizer.  I only stopped taking it because of the sugar cravings I was getting.
bipolar2,ew5xlwl,t3_cn047e,1565147768.0,"I was on lamictal 200mg and still had hypomania episodes. However, It did wonders for my depression. I’m now on an antipsychotic and lamictal and it’s working really well for me. My pdoc once told me that lamictal spaces out episodes. Who knows. I hope you find the right medication combo."
BipolarReddit,evrw2tm,t3_ckyvj6,1564720335.0,"I have BP2, I was on lamictal only and it helped the depression but did nothing for the hypomania. I went from euphoric to mixed states every week. It was tough. After a bad mixed state I was put on an antipsychotic with lamictal and I’ve been dare I say, stable for 5 months now. However, everyone is different."
bipolar2,ep0xlqe,t1_ep0seai,1558981742.0,"I’m going on 2-3 months now. My doctor says I’m “sensitive” to medication so maybe my experience will be different than others. It’s interesting how the two medications work together. Because by themselves I was still miserable. 

Best of luck to your friend!"
bipolar2,ep0r7ee,t3_bth020,1558979280.0,"The antipsychotic and mood stabilizer that I’m on helps me have a clear mind. I don’t have suicidal and self harm thoughts. I haven’t had a depression, hypomanic and mixed  episode either.  Dare to say, I’m stable. This combo just works for me."
