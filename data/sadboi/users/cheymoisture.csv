euphoria,fqal7f4,t1_fq7v513,1589220950.0,"true but try to keep in mind that rue is mentally ill and this scene was met to exhibit her instability and frustration, keeping in mind the scene before where she was humiliated in front of her class and needed something to take the edge off. dealing w mentally ill loved ones is a challenge but patience is key. rue’s illness and addiction combined create a turbulence that sometimes she can’t control and inadvertently affects her loved ones, like lexi, jules, leslie, and gia. 

this is coming from someone mentally ill btw."
BPD,foyeuok,t3_gaaikl,1588171246.0,i’m in a similar boat right now. i haven’t had a decent conversation w my FP in about 2 months and i’m scared to reach out bc of space. i feel like they don’t love me anymore and that i ruined everything by just being myself.
BPD,fmovphv,t3_fwgoqw,1586269405.0,"i feel like this most of the time. that a lot of people don’t take our relationships as seriously as i do, like i’m disposable. people say the pandemic is affecting people but it’s always been like this for me and i hate it. i’m not sure how long i can go on like this."
BPD,fmllaa1,t3_fvuu9v,1586188619.0,i always find myself mimicking my friends so when i’m alone i don’t know how to act. so i try to figure out how people perceive me. it’s so frustrating and i wonder if i’ll ever be sure of who i really am.

BPD,fljfvie,t3_fooi4w,1585210769.0,"i’m like this with zendaya’s character rue on the HBO show euphoria. i’ve been  be seen myself or how i feel so accurately represented before (rue being a black mentally ill lesbian) and i feel possessive of her almost because i suppose an attack on her is an attack on me? 

but of course there’s small differences but the majority of it (minus the opioid addiction) is relatable. it makes me happy most of the time but then i realize how weird it is."
BPD,fl3z0e2,t3_flowf0,1584802007.0,"i’ll wake up in the middle of the night and just dance to my music blasting from my headphones. this usually lasts about an hour before i’m worn out. also when my mom’s not home, i’ll do this and run from room to room. 

thank you for posting this. i don’t feel so weird anymore. :)))"
BPD,fl3yuxt,t3_fm47li,1584801902.0,"!!!!!

ALL the time. my best friend does this a lot. it makes me question whether or not i matter sometimes even though i know they love me. 

the same with a lot of my friends. i feel like it’s normalized in our culture these days. i catch myself doing it from time to time but i always try to answer back when i can. i ALWAYS answer to emergencies. i usually don’t feel comfortable confiding in someone because i know they can’t help me or i’m scared if i unload myself to them that they’ll leave me. so i try not to text serious matters to anyone because i know i won’t get an answer. i know this can be interrupted as entitled, i don’t want someone at my side every hour of every day but i wanna feel cared about."
BPD,fl3ybkz,t3_fm919w,1584801527.0,"i was clingy to my abusive ex best friend. he waited months to tell me and when he did it was in a long text message where he called me emotionally abusive, a bad person, and that i suffocated him. i attempted suicide because of this the next day because he meant the world to me. 

flash forward to now, exactly a year after. i hate him. i can’t forgive him. people say forgive and forget but i can’t. not after what he’s done to me. i hope he rots in hell. with the spread of the virus he’s trapped in france because of a study abroad program with our school (nyu) and i check his twitter to see how he’s taking it hoping he’s absolutely miserable in self-quarantine. he deserves it. 

i also find myself obsessively jealous of people i envy, though i don’t necessarily hate them but i hate that i’m not them."
BPD,fl3xvvm,t3_fmbln1,1584801214.0,i always say “you” and sometimes “we.” i’m not sure why.

euphoria,fgxxip3,t3_f0pp8r,1581177516.0,"they won’t just drop the mains, we’ll get other openings that focus on them, just maybe not all of them. we haven’t explored rue’s relationship w her dad pre-cancer, maybe jules’ mom tries to contact her, the mystery of nate’s other brother as well as the one we’ve seen, etc. they added a few more recurring characters but that doesn’t mean they’ll have much spotlight. 

i can see fez and lexi getting an episode opening but not daniel. he’s not relevant enough, i’m pretty sure he’s just meant to be a plot device. if anything he comes back to mess w cassie. i’d say there’s more of a chance of ethan getting some shine. 

if stories continue to play within the lines you get tired of them. it’s good to branch out and build."
BPD,ffzqqcr,t3_evy5b8,1580390120.0,"i feel this ALL THE TIME despite it being romantic or platonic. with all my close friendships and my best friend (who’s my FP) i worry one day they’re going to get sick of me and leave me, which is what my past best friend did last year in a really traumatic way (sent an essay length text to me telling how much of a bad person i am). 

i’m in the process of starting a relationship with this girl i’ve been talking to for about a month now and i’m scared that if she really figures out who i am that she won’t want to be with me. i’m already in disbelief that she likes me — she’s way prettier and sweet. 

it’s haunting, haha."
BPD,ffcezd0,t1_ffcaaxt,1579798026.0,"I find that she doesn't really share her own thoughts? Sometimes. But not usually. She usually just empathsizes with me, comforts, and reassures me. I'll make a note to discuss it the next time I see her.

Thank you :))"
BPD,ffc5p4c,t1_ffb3wrp,1579792130.0,"Okay good! I thought I was alone. 

I've always relied on escapism to feel at peace, so I like to pretend I'm someone else sometimes. Better - usually people with more money, more conveinently attractive, possessing skills I wish I had, etc."
BPD,ffc3m2e,t1_ffas23r,1579790708.0,"I find that therapy helps me communciate my feelings with someone unbiased and not actively invovled in my life but I'm not sure how it implements coping mechanisms. She (my therapist, who specializes in trauma) usually guides me in accessing ""parts"" of myself and to analyze how they're feeling. While it's helpful to tap into these parts, after seeing her for a few months now, I'm not sure how helpful it is anymore.

I'm coincedentally seeing my psychairist later today so I'll ask about adding an antidepressent. I've had Prozac in the past (which was a bust for me) as well as Lexapro, which kind of helped. So I'm wondering how much combining it with Lamotrigine would help.

Do you take both? How has your experience been?"
BPD,ffc0zg5,t1_ffbifyy,1579788764.0,"I've told her to get tested and to go to therapy and get medicated but she refuses and she doesn't realize how determential it's made our relationship over the past (almost) decade. 

My grandmother is similar. I think she's in the beginning stages of psychosis, though I could be wrong. Long story short she's very religious and trusts some woman who has stigmata and is likened to Christ to pray for our family (sends her hundreds of dollars at a time... really fucked up) and she spews lies about us that she believes to be true because the woman told her they are. She constantly pushes me to help my mother and when I say I have to help myself first she calls me selfish. 

So, yeah, I think there's some intense hereditary mental illness in my family but I'm the only one trying to deal with mine, and being around the rest of them only makes mine worse. I'm in my 2nd year of college and working as hard as I can to get money to move out once I graduate, but I fear a lot of the time that I may not last to see then.

Sorry if this is too much, I've just been so fed up and depressed lately."
