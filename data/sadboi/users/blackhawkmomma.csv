TapTitans2,fn1jvfz,t1_fn1jqa6,1586563557.0,It's ok! I thought it was I that was doing something wrong. Thank you for the quick reply and information.

TapTitans2,fl0s1ob,t3_flpncy,1584714474.0,"Could you try a different optimizer?  [https://www.tt2-compendium.com/en](https://www.tt2-compendium.com/en)  

I have all equipment and artifacts. If you don't then this might not be for you. Make sure you're using the right equipment. When things slow down, see which hero damage is the strongest (when war cry is not activated). In a run, I change equipment 2-3 times. I also switch pets. I alternate between my highest Gold and Damage pet.  I might switch over to gold before hitting the fairies, opening up chests and then switch back to damage pet. I keep my BOS at 50%. Once I finish a tournament, I prestige and pump my BOS back up to 50. Then I save the rest of my prestige to upgrade artifacts during a tournament. Any equipment upgrades I do during the tournament as well. Also, I don't push past my MS outside of tourneys. If things are close, I wait until the last 45 mins of the tourny before I do my push and sometimes am able to sneak into 1st place."

Nest,f82pwxb,t1_f82pdfx,1574195949.0,"I am not sure what wire nut to plug into the nest. I think one has to be a transformer wire, but I am not sure about the other wire.  If the thick red wire is a transformer wire, there is one red one going to 3 of the post along with 2 littler wires.  The end of the nest only has room for one wire to fit in."
Nest,f82mzq1,t1_f82mmdw,1574194360.0,"ok, what is the thick red one for? And which one goes into the nest?  I am not sure if I twist the orange wires together it would fit into the nest connector."
