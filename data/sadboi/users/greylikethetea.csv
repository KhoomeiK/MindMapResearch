femalefashionadvice,fq9sbyp,t3_gh733k,1589206033.0,"yeah, I know what you mean. Growing up we bought everything from goodwills and second-hand shops, or the clearance at target. I never considered clothing as something to want I guess, I just knew I got it when I needed it. I felt guilty growing up whenever I did want an article of clothing that I didn't need, so I rarely asked because I knew money was tight and my mom hated not being able to buy things for us for fun. 

But this isn't all bad because it taught me a lot as I have my own money now and it also greatly helped me to appreciate saving and being careful with what I buy and how much I buy.

I'll admit, I may be a bit addicted to online shopping now because I never could buy just what I wanted as a kid. But I also am very cautious in that sense too because I know the value of being careful with money and only spending a lot of money on things I know will last and really love. So when I buy things online, it takes me a long time to decide if I'll get it or not, and I try not to spend over $20 at a time.

I do my best to catch sales and almost never buy things that are full price because of the guilt I feel when I do. Five dollars, ten dollars... that's a lot of money to me, and I think that's not a bad thing either because the more value you place in a small amount of money, the more prone you are to be careful how you spend that small amount, let alone any large sum :)"

My sister and I are both closer to introverted but I do kinda miss a few close friends. But I rarely got to hang out with them before anyway so theres not such a big change.
But I mean yeah, it has been wildly productive on my end and I do feel bad for having relief over this when there are people struggling and risking their lives out there because they have to. I take comfort in the idea that me staying home helps them a little bit, if nothing else.
But seriously, I do really enjoy being inside and outside with no crowds, taking quiet walks and watching tv with my mom and sister way into the early hours of the morning. It almost feels like quarentine gave that back to us and since I'm about to graduate high school, it's a bittersweet send-off to childhood.

Oh yeah, as for group chats... I haven't been in many but the few I have are stressful and feel/felt pointless. A lot of patting on the back or passive agresive stuff. I don't even know.

AskReddit,foyqojh,t1_foyobsr,1588177402.0,"I'm not informed enough to say they have or haven't, to be honest. But seeing how conservatism has changed, I wouldn't be surprised if the old right-wing politicians did act like that, and even some modern ones. The thing is politics is about choosing the lesser of two evils. And it's impossible to compare evils, which is what makes it difficult to say you agree with one side or the other. I'd suggest doing research from both sides of the story. 

Obviously there will be racist conservatives, but there are racist liberals too. I believe racism is a problem, but also a problem that in some situations is blown out of proportion on both sides. It depends heavily on circumstance and informed opinion."
AskReddit,foyq7hg,t3_ga4gjx,1588177154.0,"Ok, I did already post a story on here but I thought of another that happened to my sister.

When we were younger we shared a room. One morning we woke up and noticed that my sister had a child's handprint on her bicep, bright red as if a hand had been pressed there for hours. It was at such an angle that there's no way she could have made it herself in her sleep without having literally broken her arm to do so.

 Now I was prone to sleepwalking (wait imagine me standing over my sister's sleeping body with my hand on her arm for hours \*shivers\*) but when we put my hand on it, the print was much smaller, and still defined enough to know it wasn't fading out of size. I was only 8 or 9, but this handprint looked like a toddler's almost. We never did figure out why or how it got there, freaked us out for a long time after"
AskReddit,foymf6l,t3_ga4gjx,1588175142.0,"my sister almost drowned when she was much younger. At the time I was around four maybe, and she's two years older than me. I remember the day, and even vaguely the event. But I have an even more distinct memory of being at the bottom of that pool, drowning. It's like it actually happened to me, and I always assumed it did until I was a little older (maybe ten or so?) and they said *she'd* almost drowned. I never said I thought it was me for fear they'd think I was trying to get attention. 

But they described the events of that day exactly as I remembered them, but instead, it was what happened to my sister, and it was the strangest thing. I've never been able to explain why I have one of her memories so vividly since we didn't talk about it for years after it happened. They weren't hiding it from us, it just never got brought up.  


My sister and I are very close; it might just be me imagining vividly what it was like. Strange thing is, it's the same feeling as my own memories, it doesn't feel made-up. I can feel myself sinking to the bottom of the pool, see our dad reaching his hand up. Losing my breath, and my eyes burning from chlorine, and then being pulled out.

Trying to make everyone else happy has rarely ever benefitted me or anyone else in that position long-term happiness.
I know one things for sure, this strange time is also a great opportunity for a lot of people to self-examine. Now the life I ived before isolation was basically the same so I've been doing it for a while, but it's only now that everyone else is doing it that I kind of see changes and developement.
I understand your point really well too.

Truth is, I don't stay conservative because of my parents. I've educated myself, and you said you have too, which means you have a valid basis and you also have the right to chose your opinions and act on them.

I've looked at the options and seen how liberals act and I have chosen the side I can agree with the most. As with all politics, there are things about radical conservatives I don't agree with just as much as with liberals. It does suck to be told that I don't care or that I'm stupid by strangers who are angry because they don't see the same logic I'm seeing. Its because I care and because I researched that I feel like I can have this stance. 

And I don't like politics to begin with, but they're important. So from one conservative gal to another, thanks for standing up to what you believe in, and you've got support here if/whenever you need it!"

I implore people to stay away maybe selfishly. But also, I know, because I was hurt by someone like me. And I may enjoy outsmarting but I never want to make more people like this. For my own pride's sake, I can't seem to admit these problems face to face with anyone.
I guess that's why my reddit posts are mostly be complaining. It's probably irritating. I've got nothing else to dump these things into.
The problem is when I devote myself to screwing up I seem to go all the way. I've made a big mistake in trusting a lot of people and the actions I took after probably made them feel abandoned and angry. I know that feeling. I just don't seem to be able to stop making other people feel that way. Bravery and common sense are difficult to couple for me. I have the want to admit I've done wrong to people. Not the will.
And when I'm angry and frusterated I guess I see myself as a manipulative person. It does mean so much to me when people can see me as otherwise.
The truth is, I'm not smarter than anyone, I just hate that fact. So I can pretend all I want that I'm better but I'll never be. I am becoming okay with that. Apathy, incidentally, is a helpful tool to cope with my inability to measure up to siblings and peers. But I am always frusterated at my self and for my own sake. There's nothing in the world that seems to stop it.

Sometimes when I'm doing art I focus so much on it and worry other people won't like it to the point that I stop liking it myself. In those times, I think it's a good idea to step away, avoid comparing yourself to other artist's work, and try to look back on why you draw/write/sew/sing (do art) in general- because it makes you happy and you're creating something beautiful.

How obnoxious is that? Nobody naturally chats about how much they're attracted to the opposite sex, right? We'd think that was creepy and irritating if a girl was like, ""holy crap I love men so much."" Nobody cares"

prolife,flt4jc4,t3_fquvgg,1585459025.0,"well, it depends on why you are pro-life really. If it's because you believe abortion is murder, your arguments will be very different than if you think it's wrong because people should be more responsible and shouldn't be taking pregnancy and responsibility so lightly, or if it's because of any other number of reasons. Depending on where you sit morally, that's how you argue your point. You said you weren't religious, so you already know you don't want/need those arguments. You'll find the best arguments are simply what is the truth. Research is the best way to argue your point because facts, although difficult to swallow for some, are most often difficult or impossible to argue properly with opinion alone  :) good luck!"

I've spent like 15 minutes preparing a package before taping it up, making sure there wasn't a spot of lint, dust, or hair to be seen, and praying that nothing would get stuck to the tape and that my handwriting looked nice and that the tissue paper wasn't torn. It was a whole ordeal and I don't think I could fathom doing any less because I know I'd be really disappointed and angry if I paid $$ plus $8 shipping for something with someone's hair or stains or something that smelled bad"

I realized this before COVID-19 but being in isolation really solidified it. I came to understand that it's not conversations I don't like, but pointless ones. I genuinely enjoy and miss deep and good conversations, and quality time spent with people outside family. I never really thought that was true before now, because I am really appreciating not having to make small talk right now as well as missing good conversation. I guess I always told myself I wasn't a people person- when really I just wasn't a polite super sticky sweet fake conversation person. I don't mind- in fact I enjoy- real conversations that mean something and lead to friendships and relationships that mean more than superficial politeness. I'm not mad about this discovery."
poshmark,flk75pl,t1_fljypvu,1585235305.0,"yesss. They should have an option for longer, cheaper shipping, and then they can keep the $7.99 shipping if you want it in 2 days"
poshmark,flk71tq,t3_fparji,1585235242.0,"I would buy more too. Honestly, doing everything I can do to sell stuff, I've had Poshmark since December or earlier maybe and I've sold one thing. But I sold that one thing for 8 bucks... and the person had to pay 8 bucks shipping too, so it was wildly unlikely to happen but it did. Now, no matter what I do I can't sell anything, especially since the shipping hike I believe. There's nothing wrong with what I'm selling; the photographs look as nice as someone without professional equipment can make them look. I've gotten a spattering of likes despite my frequent and plentiful shares. I think the thing is that like me, when you see something on Poshmark you automatically assume you can't do it because the shipping is way too expensive. If I had higher value stuff, I'd be happy to do free shipping, but the stuff I sell isn't that valuable and it'd be impossible to sell a tank top for 15 bucks with free shipping if it's second hand anyway. If I have a shirt that I think should be 5 bucks, I still have to price it at like 9-12 to make a profit. And nobody is going to buy that."

fashionhistory,fl5qutn,t3_fmqaur,1584843387.0,"Beautiful! Since she doesn't have the leg-o-mutton sleeves of much of the 1890s but she *is* wearing a blouse, indicative of the time after the structured bodice (mid-1890s- on into the 1910s), I would say it appears to be around 1900- early 1910s. I don't think it would be in the 1910s due to the blouse style, but possibly just before. I'm going mostly off the blouse and skirt style as her hair is not the typical round ""Gibson"" shape of that era that many women had, and could really fit in several eras seamlessly, nix the bow."

AskReddit,fknt5ne,t3_fjep7t,1584373384.0,"I thought buying clothes was something you did when you absolutely had to. Like, you were getting holes in things or outgrowing them. As I got older I started to notice people talking about shopping for fun and buying ""clothes they didn't need"" or just stuff they liked and I was really surprised that people did that. It seemed so expensive to buy things just whenever you liked them.

I was also shocked that 10 bucks is not a lot of money for some people. Even as an almost-adult I am shocked when people say they spent ten bucks on a snack or something. And I know that's cheap for a lot of people but like... $10?

I'm blessed to be out of that financial situation now and am planning to get another job full time when I graduate school, but having a job and having an income was really shocking to me for the first time. Spending a large amount of my money on a computer for school was surreal and I felt both proud and guilty. It's something I think makes those things more important to me, because I appreciate now what I went without back then."

DoesAnybodyElse,fkg2waf,t1_fkfylww,1584148618.0,"the thing is, he is a very social and open person. He has a lot of friends who are girls, good friends who I know too. And he's talked to me about how every girl he meets seems to get a crush on him just because he helps them and is there for him. He's a genuinely comforting guy to talk to, and that's just it.

I don't want him to think I am only close to him because I find him attractive. I think he'd feel betrayed. And I'm not, but that's a lot of the reason. I do like him, naturally. And I know he doesn't feel the same way now. 

However, his girlfriend just appeared out of nowhere about a year ago. He didn't tell me anything about her. Of course, we weren't as close then as we are now. But I thought he'd at least mention it.

But yeah, our goals are too different. We aren't compatible in that way, and I worry I only like him because he's the first person to hear me out and be there for me when other people can't be or just aren't. And that would be a miserable life, my husband having to be my therapist. 

It doesn't make it any easier though."
