Subjects in A Levels are genuinely much more complex  in a sense that they require a lot more attention than subjects did before, and if you choose subjects that you may not use later or don't have a particular interest in, it really affects your grades negatively. I've seen a lot of people who choose commerce subjects or the sciences in A levels thinking it'll get them a job, despite not having a keen interest in those subjects and it's sad to see how much they have to struggle to get by. I am grateful that I realised what my interests were early on, and while A Levels is quite a tiring journey, I am glad that I chose the subjects that *I* wanted to do."
