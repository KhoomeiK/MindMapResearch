Remember the garlic festival shooting? Who the fuck would do that just to shoot up people. If they wanted mass death they would probably do it at a huge concert or convention. I am pretty sure it was for the attention. They think being infamous is better than not being famous at all. Yes, obviously mourn for the victims but really the headlines and stories and what not are really not doing anything but just giving attention to the shooters. At the very least, when reporting on the shooting, never mention the shooter. I think the attention should go to the victims mostly. And no one is ever bringing this point up."
