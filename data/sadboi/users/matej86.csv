Interesting use of the term ""instead of"" by the way. Here's the thing, it's possible to tax wealthy members of society, and businesses who are using loop holes to reduce their tax bill *at the same time*. It's not an either or option. 

There's also a massive difference between earning £40k and £100k. After tax £40k will give you about £2500 per month. £100k will give you £5k net per month. While £40k is a good salary it's not mega bucks and would barely support a family of 4 who also have a mortgage to pay.

To clarify, those who earn more should pay more, because they can. Those who earn less should pay less, because it's what they can afford.
