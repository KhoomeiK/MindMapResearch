masseffect,eymq0ff,t1_eymgla8,1567216409.0,"Exactly this, every ending bar Destroy changes the galactic landscape far too greatly. Synthesis supposedly means forever-peace, whilst Shepard-Reapers from Control dwarfs any future conflicts, also its pretty ambiguous whether Destroy kills all AI, and besides lol what's to stop people from just creating them again? I would **LOVE** an aftermath of the Reaper war, I've said it before on this sub but if they also make curing the genophage canon that's another huge plot point/conflict straight away which would be awesome if explored"

SuicideWatch,eymmy2z,t1_eykunrq,1567213785.0,"Yeah fuck I feel so guilty for being depressed and anxious despite being good looking, even though it's not fair to do that to myself, we all have our own experiences in life which affect us for better or worse"
science,eyjs815,t1_eyjo2hu,1567126846.0,"Exactly mate, and what's worse is that you're barely even working for yourself, the majority of the fruits of (most) labour goes to the people at the top, and this is all deemed normal. We have evidence time and again that the rich and powerful are corrupt (and just generally evil) and have people FUCKING MURDERED for exposing them and yet nothing is done, we need to legitimately organise some sort of resistance movement to rise up against our corporate overlords but it's such a colossal undertaking that I don't even know where to start, I just end up feeling overwhelmed whenever I think of it, so all I'm doing now is trying to sort out my own mental health so I can actually tackle today's problems."

And besides I would say **EVERYONE** is an addict, whether it's alcohol, sex, drugs, screen, hobbies or whatever, we all have vices that we like to indulge in (and subsequently cause us problems if we indulge too much), everyone's got issues, most people should worry more about their own instead of losing their shit over someone else's (obviously this is contextually based, if it's someone you know personally it's a different story, but some random dude on the Internet? Fuck off and worry about your own life)"

AskReddit,exjdy76,t1_exhjpsg,1566348021.0,">once you've found a glimmer of good cheer, it's that much easier to view things **as they are** as opposed to how they ""should be"" or ""shouldn't be""

Holy hell have I needed this, I've been so caught up and twisted by the injustice and bs in the world and how that it isn't how it ""should be"", you've reminded me that not everything is controllable and this comment in itself is fantastic, thankyou"
