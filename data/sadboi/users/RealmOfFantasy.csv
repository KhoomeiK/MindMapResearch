That being said, I would recommend talking about how much they expect per month and discuss whether or not that is setting you up for failure (never affording to leave) or success (leaving enough savings to move on your own).

And let‚Äôs say this girl actually wanted to because her mom was wearing one, can she still choose to take it off after? Or will she be like the multiple girls I know that take it off once they‚Äôre in a safe zone where no family or family friend members will see her?"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ey9ntc4,t1_ey9kxto,1566947919.0,No one needs it. The men in the family that think hijabs are okay are the one‚Äôs that need a reality check and learn not to be such perverts.

ATAAE,ewvmcgc,t1_ewufgup,1565809299.0,It could be the surface area and weight that a braces bracket has. I‚Äôve had braces break on me multiple times. I‚Äôve now had those permanent retainers and it‚Äôs been over 10 years and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it.
antinatalism,ewvku37,t3_cq873s,1565808365.0,"As someone your age, I totally get your frustration. The thing is, most people are so apathetic when it comes to having kids and the negative impacts in has on that kid and the environment. 

At the same time, I absolutely love kids. I think they are way better than dealing with any adult. So, to make the situation better, you can be the best influence in those kids‚Äô lives. Teach them things that their parents aren‚Äôt going to because they aren‚Äôt the smartest, obviously. 

As someone mentioned you can always adopt kids too. There are plenty of kids that need loving people in their life.

Unfortunately, people just aren‚Äôt going to stop having kids anytime soon. We have to educate the youth because they‚Äôre pretty much the only hope for this planet."

Especially considering how hard it is to actually find the right drug to work with an individual, the withdrawals, the reintroduction to some of the shittiest symptoms had from before the medication. This is depressing, literally."

That‚Äôs cool though, I don‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôm mostly concerned about my prescription meds being cool there."
qatar,ew16qq1,t1_ew15oi8,1565016493.0,"Interesting. I‚Äôve lived in Lebanon and it seems a lot more different than I had expected. 
I‚Äôd most likely stay in the pearl area of Doha for the most part if that changes anything at all. 
I had no idea my shoulders had to be covered. I‚Äôm currently dying of heat at 22 degrees Celsius so I hope tops with no cuffs but cover the majority of the shoulders would be okay. 
Also what about style of clothing, are my punk band Ts going to be an issue? Like nothing vulgar or inappropriate but also not typical style of there I‚Äôm assuming. 

Thank you a lot for your input by the way."
