bipolar,fr11k4p,t3_glxd8u,1589811441.0,"Take that route. BUT try and do it the steady way. ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôll need to keep my job to pay for the internet to upload the videos, so let‚Äôs keep working and focus my weekends on filming and uploading videos. I want to do xyz craft for the Etsy store, so in the evenings I‚Äôm going to try and make 1/2/3/whatever is reasonable number of things and when I have an inventory of (some amount) I‚Äôll launch the store.‚Äù

And then review all the terms and conditions and payouts and figure out how many views and sales you would need to afford the van and get it tricked out. 

And then start working on it in your free time and whenever you dread going to work focus on the idea of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna spend so much time building my dream life this evening!‚Äù

LifeAfterSchool,fqzuja6,t3_glt3d9,1589775728.0,"It really sounds like you‚Äôre dealing with depression, and based on the student debt I‚Äôm gonna say you‚Äôre in the US and not able to access healthcare easily. 

First things first, forget about the debt. You can‚Äôt deal with it right now so set that to the back burner. It ain‚Äôt going away so don‚Äôt stress about it. You can always deal with that later. 

Second, don‚Äôt feel like a failure due to the MCAT. Just don‚Äôt. Why? Because you still went to school, still took the classes, etc. You don‚Äôt lose all that knowledge just because you didn‚Äôt get a good score on the MCAT. Instead, review all your classes you‚Äôve taken, and figure out what other majors your classes cross with easily. What about PharmTech? What about physical therapy? Is there anything similar that can cross into with few additional classes? Ignore the passion part for now. It sucks, but the reality is for most people is you follow your passion off the clock. I work in a factory as QA, but my dream is to be a writer. That‚Äôs what I do in the evenings while the QA work keeps the lights on. 

Third, job searching is a lot more about quantity than quality until you get an interview. Aim for three to five job applications a day- more if you‚Äôve got time. Also look into temp agencies in your area. Temp agencies frequently have temp to hire positions. Aerotek is a good one that operates in a lot of places. They‚Äôll find interviews for you. 

Lastly, your mother. I‚Äôve dealt with really shitty living situations. I feel for you, especially when you don‚Äôt have options. It‚Äôs tough. The best thing I can say there is to meditate. As much as you can, work meditation into your life. InSight Timer is an awesome free app- check out the courses section. And every time she talks shit, every time you hear her talking shit about you, put in another job application. Use it to motivate you to get out. Prove her wrong and live your best life away from her. 

Good luck. You got this."

Sadly she left the practice but set me up with another lady there who she thought would be a good match, but then the pandemic started and I didn‚Äôt get beyond the first two meetings. 

I guess I‚Äôm trying to say is that therapists are people and it‚Äôs like doing a group project where the project is you.

A couple months is a little long when he wasn‚Äôt an instigator, and I would institute ways for him to earn it back. Maybe two months is the original length of time but for every garbage bag of litter he picks up off the ground is two days off, and writing a well thought out apology letter takes a couple days off, and maybe a research paper on the effects of cyber bullying takes a week or two off depending on length."

Even with just the current hospitals open we don‚Äôt have enough, let alone stocking field hospitals. Maybe if the federal government was working with the states instead of outbidding them we could set up some temporary locations, but that‚Äôs currently not happening. Even if we did, we would have atleast a few weeks if not months needed to flip plants over to producing medical supplies.

I‚Äôm an essential worker and I know kids are caught inside all day so there may be more that I don‚Äôt see. I do see plenty of people using the park in the evenings and just staying away from the playground. The two families I saw arrive and didn‚Äôt clean before or after use, and it‚Äôs like one of those giant jungle gyms with slides and stuff- not detached like swings, so it would be hard for them to wipe down the whole thing. If it was swings that I saw them wiping down, I‚Äôd honestly probably be less likely to say something."
AmItheAsshole,fp4jc8t,t1_fp4ewgn,1588300315.0,"I think the point is, atleast in this post, you emphasized how much you enjoy cleaning, and how much he enjoys having you clean, and views the time you spend cleaning as the time your spending together. You don‚Äôt y‚Äôall about what you do at his house other than... clean. You also don‚Äôt mention him wanting you to live there for any reason other than wanting you to clean. 

I love cleaning. I sincerely do. I enjoy things being neat and when my boyfriend and I were living separately I loved tidying up while I was over cause thats just what I do. But now that we live together and it doesn‚Äôt happen unless I‚Äôm doing it and seeing how far things fall is now the biggest source of our arguments. He forgets to move laundry until he‚Äôs out of clothes completely. Forgets to take out the trash and recycling. Dishes. Litterbox. All of it. He‚Äôs working on it but I never realized how much it would wear on me when it went from me being nice to me being the one responsible for it every single day."

Vent,fp05pje,t1_fp0571y,1588202975.0,"The idea of telling someone to move if they don‚Äôt like a country a) implies that it‚Äôs possible to just move and b) implies that they should easily have access to moving if they so wanted. Moving is a hard process that takes multiple steps especially when leaving a country, and is expensive even if you‚Äôre able to go through all those steps. 

Tack onto that that many countries exist at a disadvantage because of people moving due to not liking their own country, causing issues for people who already lived there. The USA is one such example, where Europeans ‚Äújust moved‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt like their own countries, at the disadvantage of the Natives that lived there who did not have that option. 

Telling someone to move is the same as saying if you don‚Äôt like walking just fly."

Second, your guy is probably right. Meds help you stabilize, but it‚Äôs like using a cane. If you only use a cane and never focus on strengthening your leg muscles, you‚Äôre always gonna need more help. Meds are the cane to your mind. Your brain‚Äôs been working without the right chems for a while, and therapy will help your brain figure out how to use those chems. 

Not every therapist is right for every person. It sounds like you have a severe case and it could be that those who turned you down likely realized that they weren‚Äôt equipped to help you. That being the case there‚Äôs been a sharp increase in telemedicine for every field, including therapy. Especially when dealing with trying to let the walls down, sometimes videoconferencing from a place you‚Äôre comfortable in can make it easier to open up to a therapist. 

There‚Äôs also different types of therapy. Depending on how you like to think, whether you focus on how you relate to others, using analytical based approaches, etc you can benefit from trying out different kinds and do find a therapist that works in your preferred method can help you find a path to stick to. Here‚Äôs a link to an explanation of some of them.

Lastly, there are other options if you don‚Äôt want to pursue therapy, but I would take them with a grain of salt and only after exploring the therapy options above. You‚Äôve spoken about your physical journey for health, but what about spiritual/wholistic type health? Yoga and meditation have both been shown to do wonders for people‚Äôs mental health, especially when used in conjunction with meds and therapy. I would not advise trying to base your whole mental health plan around those, but they can help bridge some of the gaps."

When he gets angry, and it‚Äôs when and not an if, ask if he wants you there for just the rest of his life or if he intends to be there for the rest of yours. The rest of his life won‚Äôt be very long at this rate, so emphasize that point.
