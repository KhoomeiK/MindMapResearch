depression,faputsq,t1_faptsec,1576293757.0,"It's all right, you showed up and put forth the effort. The rest is kinda outta your hands."
depression,faps9by,t1_fao9yvo,1576292680.0,Temp tests? So you didn't end up interviewing?

depression,famljsq,t3_cml6ni,1576206773.0,"I had such a good day today. I keep dreading on how I'm gonna feel tomorrow after such a ""high"". Still wish had someone to help with the flip.ðŸ˜”"
depression,fai3tb5,t1_fahjajr,1576099264.0,"Had a couple of hours where I got busy, it distracted me from my head. I guess if I think about it, I guess I get up to seek any sort of relief. But man it's hard wearing this mask in front of others"

depression,facxn0k,t1_facuntd,1575949535.0,"Yeah, you can. I feel so alone I cried three times last week. My family or friends would probably never believe it. 

I'm depressed but I wanna live my life. I own 11 firearms, never have I considered using one on myself. They're just a hobby I've had for so long. I also work in power generation where there's many lethal hazards at every turn. I still do my best to get myself and my coworkers home safe."

depression,fa98vgc,t1_fa978p1,1575865558.0,"Really I wouldn't. Doesn't matter if he's Jesuses cousin, if there's drugs in the mix it could end up being detrimental to you. You sound like a smart person so I'm probably telling you what you already know."
depression,fa96fvc,t1_fa93fd1,1575863668.0,I think if you tell your friends you left because you'd felt tempted they should understand. If they're the right kind of friends. You can be selfish if concerns your health. Hope you get out well.
depression,fa918mr,t1_fa903vz,1575859816.0,Uhhhhh... please do? Nothing wrong with an Irish exit either.

depression,fa8olmm,t1_fa7bdsd,1575851023.0,"If you're talking highschool, just try to keep em high enough to pass. And focus the rest of your attention at finding methods of proving your mood. I'm 25 and depression found me in recent years. Like you said it's like others keep moving forward and hitting their goals when there's been a quite a few times this year I have to call in sick because the energy is not there. It's hard and lately I've shed a few tears but let's try to find any reason to press on."
depression,fa8nztf,t1_fa7qtvv,1575850612.0,It wouldn't.
Gifts,fa8iza9,t3_e7p21a,1575847340.0,What's your materials? I loved playing cars as child and got into building cardboard neighborhoods for a while there. That's really dope!
depression,fa7fvta,t3_e7vxms,1575834405.0,Some things you can't control. You can't control that person's reaction toward you. But we can learn to accept this adversity. It's out of our hands. I struggle with this too.

depression,f9vqzxt,t1_f9vpy68,1575677412.0,"Yes. I've always thought I may have been born in the wrong century but the truth is I always feel out of place. I feel like everyone is moving forward but I'm still peddling the same old bullshit. I can't connect with others either, there's always this invisible barrier I could not climb over with a ladder even if I could see the damn thing. Also not suicidal, but I'm not sure I'd be missed."
depression,f9vppa2,t1_f9v8xfn,1575676447.0,"I've never been glad someone got fired, hope all is well:) I think about quitting but I haven't because I'm not sure it would help. I've worked outside of my home state at the same plant for 3 years. It's either be at work or be back home depressed. All my old friends moved away and it's been so hard meeting anyone new. Never thought being a young adult would ache my heart so much."
depression,f9thumz,t3_cml6ni,1575625064.0,"We had a party at work yesterday. The plant manager brought a motivational speaker which I thought would be a crock of shit but he brought up depression and I took his advice to heart. I didn't even think I could make it all day being at the shop around my coworkers. They don't know I'm depressed, pretty sure they think I'm just an asshole. I'm here now hoping to learn from you all and support if possible. It's nice to see I'm not alone."
depression,f9th5il,t1_f9pgixu,1575623974.0,I wish you the best in finding an escape while still at home. As a kid I lived through physical and emotional abuse. Things definitely got better after highschool when I started taking control of my own life.
depression,f9tgbqq,t1_f9r4uii,1575622715.0,Nice! You'll do well!
depression,f9tft1z,t3_dx2h8x,1575621941.0,"Yes, it's like letting someone else take the wheel for a while. Don't typically have nightmares so big win for me if I dream."
