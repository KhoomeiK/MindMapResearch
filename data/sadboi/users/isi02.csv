Every human being has inherent value regardless of “productivity.” You’ve been struggling hard the best you can. You’ve been trying to survive in your own way and that’s necessarily going to crowd out other things and that’s okay. No one including doctors has the right to shame you and make value judgments when they don’t live in your skin and don’t know what you’ve been through and how much you do struggle. I really relate to you though. I wish the world was more understanding. I wish there was more social support, no judgment, kindness for all mental health difficulties...

Of course, your situation is different, but I reflected on why I wanted to explain myself and how that would help anything and the patterns with this person when I tried to be vulnerable about my needs. I came to the conclusion I wanted to explain because I wanted to feel heard for once, of them confirming that they are truly sorry for how they treated me and they’ve reflected sincerely on our relationship and will seriously try better from now. But I realized their patterns of saying they always try to do better but never actually do. They are hypocritical, incredibly defensive, selfish, and incapable of real self-reflection in general as I have noticed in their interactions with other people. When I try to assert my needs/boundaries, they either are insincerely fawning to get me to shut up or outright explode on me with such vitriol. So I knew these were the patterns and they never tried to actually understand or compromise with me, only demanding I do all the heavy lifting in the relationship. So I blocked because I am tired of wasting my time and energy and so much grief into trying to make this person respect me and our relationship. No more.

I try hard to be accommodating... to try to allow for mistakes... but really, it’s about not knowing for sure what is actually acceptable behavior and feeling like my needs/boundaries don’t matter and I don’t expect people to care about respecting my comfort. But I know deep down the incident wasn’t acceptable so it just festers inside me until it grows into a discomfort I can’t ignore and I’m like “Wait, I don’t like this” but it feels too late to say anything. Ugh.

I will just say that the right people will always want to listen to your concerns, no matter how long ago it was. They don’t want to you feel bad and they will want to make up for it. I can’t say if it’ll be impossible to talk to these people. Maybe they could be open to criticism.

CPTSD,fqnu7fw,t3_gjvhtg,1589501490.0,"Yes, I believe that love or the lack of it is at the source of both healing and trauma.... Although honestly, this is in an intellectual sense. And I believe this for others. But I don’t viscerally feel it for myself. I cut myself off from receiving and feeling love too. I wasn’t even aware that this is an actually painful way to be until relatively recently. I just thought it was how it had to be, for something as despicable as me. It doesn’t really register as a lot of pain for me... but just that it’s necessary. Yeah, it hurts but so what? But when I hear people say that this way of life really hurts for them, it takes me aback and makes me reflect. Is this way of thinking actually really hurtful? Is it ok for me to actually... allow myself to receive and feel love? What would that even feel like? Questions I struggle with so much.

Relatedly, one of my favorite series is called Umineko: When They Cry. It’s a story that goes into excruciating and graphic details about intergenerational trauma and abuse (big warnings if anyone is interested). But its central message is “Without love, the truth can’t be seen.” Without love, we get broken. Abuse fundamentally breaks our sense of love for ourselves (and others) and that is tragic. We deeply, deeply hurt if we don’t experience it and feel like we are incapable of ever receiving it. But with self love and compassion, healing can foster after abuse. With love, we can see where people are coming from despite all their intense flaws and legitimately bad things they’ve done. We may not accept or even like them for it, but understanding breeds some kind of compassion anyway. The same goes for ourselves. Love is at the root of everything and is the main thing that can really save and heal people. That’s the truth. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share that. I still cant.... emotionally grasp that for myself though, honestly. But I hope one day I will. I just want to let you know that you’re not alone in feeling like this."

I still  feel so isolated. I know I’m distant... people call me a “ghost” jokingly but it’s the truth. I really cannot shake the feeling that getting too close to people will lead to inevitable rejection and even abuse. I can never allow myself to be abused as I have in the past so I stay away. The thing is though I have had bad relationships so yes that has reinforced the anxiety/doubt... but I did them keep at arms’ length so they never really knew me. And It’s one thing if people reject me but don’t really know me... but if people genuinely really liked me, even love, and really really saw me and then hated me even remotely like I hate myself, I don’t know what I would do. 

I don’t know. I’m just... trying to learn how to trust. To believe in people when they say they do like me unconditionally. To learn how to believe in... myself.

attachment_theory,fqjsei7,t3_gijc2l,1589414515.0,"Yeah, secure people can be tough to stay with because they're so unfamiliar to us... love being certain and unconditional is truly a foreign concept. But I've found increasingly, little by little, how good it actually feels to actually try to get closer to them. I'm increasingly getting tired of being involved with immature/emotionally unavailable/insecure attachments and getting disappointed; the hype, the adrenaline, the love bombing, mind games, etc are just grinding me down. They just reinforce to me that I'm unloveable in the end. And with secure people, they will be a rock for you. They let you feel like you really do deserve love and you can count on it... perhaps not a life-shattering, savior-type love like it's romanticized in media and all that, but their kind of love I can viscerally feel is healthy for me and I just need to let myself believe that I do deserve it.

So basically I guess is try to believe in yourself that you deserve healthy relationships, to see how these patterns only lead to getting hurt and you deserve better, to start lowering your desire for immediate gratification for high levels of passion. Healthy amount of love and passion needs to build up gradually. I understand though the deep fear of intimacy. I really, really do. I'm also really struggling with this but I hope this helps you. I wish you luck."

I overextended so much, I have drained myself to make this person happy, and it was NEVER good enough for them. I suppressed myself bc I didn’t want to hurt them and they’re in pain and they’ve been good to me too etc so my needs were never the priority. And I felt like a monster and it’s my mental health that’s causing discomfort when I tried to speak up about my own needs but no, they just never respected me. They were selfish and manipulative and forced me to bend over backwards for their own comfort and tried to make me feel like a bad person for not giving into all their demands. They made me feel like such shit about myself but since I already have poor self-worth tbh, I didn’t even see that. 

I identify a lot as I too have a background of abuse and neglect and now I realize codependency is rooted in all that. I put up with these toxic relationships for far longer than people with good boundaries would have because I have no idea what I should deserve. Still though, I am very grateful that I have people in my life who talked me through all this and confirmed these people are all giant red flags and these were bad friendships. They made EVERYONE super uncomfortable. Everyone could see they were taking advantage of me and I tried way too hard to accommodate them but that was never appreciated. And I was not the crazy, toxic one they let me believe I was but the things they did to me were unacceptable. Very illuminating when I told someone about how they tell me they love me but screamed at me for always being a horrible, scary demon to them and they replied that that’s not “mixed messages” as I told myself. That’s just lying. And that’s a shitty thing to do to a supposed friend.

But yeah, it has been an informative experience. It’s made me realize that wow, I really don’t love myself. I put up with it all bc quite frankly, it reminds me of my childhood. It’s familiar.

I only recently discovered I have codependent traits but it really explains so much especially because I literally have a disorder based on over control. That’s.. interesting. 

I really identify with what you said about not being set up to receive in a relationship, never feeling like I have the right to be first to someone. When my partner said, “Of course it’s not a problem to listen to you, that’s my job,” I was... really taken aback. When a friend apologized for not responding immediately back to a 5 am, anxiety fueled vent which I never expected to them to because of course they were sleeping and I just wanted to rant to someone and they didn’t have to respond until they had the time etc...

attachment_theory,fq5cxvq,t1_fq4bzky,1589100621.0,"Yeah, the irony when APs can be so intrusive and disrespect boundaries and need for space for DAs but claim  that DAs are the ones who don’t care enough.

I’ve known a lot of people like that too and that kind of covert narcissism is just as bad as the overt narcissism that DAs are capable of. I would even say the former can be even trickier to handle bc there can be lots of emotional manipulation there that’s hard to call out or you get painted as an uncaring, mean person that’s hurting a vulnerable lamb.... 

Like one big thing that I really dislike about APs is their tendency to demand intimacy/vulnerability or you’re the bad guy. You can’t demand intimacy from people. You can assert your honest desires that you want to be closer and all that but forcing intimacy and holding it over the other person’s head as moral condemnation if they don’t is an invasion of boundaries and so disrespectful. Actual care means respecting other people where they are at, their needs too, because vulnerability can be so hard for people. But also knowing your needs and desires cannot always be fulfilled and the other person should be allowed to say no to you."
attachment_theory,fq4b5cz,t3_ggos74,1589075556.0,"Agreed. Plus, I think it’s more likely to hear from AP’s complaints as they use protest behaviors and are verbose about their emotions whereas DAs will naturally be more stoic, so there’s that too. But I have found APs to be equally as hard to deal with and unaware of how their excessive need for external validation can be bothersome and intrusive to other people, very much obsessed with their own needs at the expense of others. I have noticed that many can try to manipulate with tactics like claiming since they care so much, the problem can’t be with them and people need to appreciate that care (or else they’re mean for not doing so, seems to be the implication). APs definitely aren’t immune to being abusive or just plain bad friends/partners as well. The AP/DA push pull cycle can be too blamed on the DA side whereas APs tend to disregard how they can be just as much if not more of the problem ...

DAs really don’t have to be that bad, it depends. They can be quite respectful and caring people, they’re just not as showy about it."

Still though, I've noticed there does seem to be a difference when there are insecurities about feeling like an object which is my own doing in healthy relationships and actually being taken advantage of.

I just recently discovered that I'm FA and it was so helpful in explaining my life... also overwhelming bc it's considered the most ""difficult"" attachment style... but it does help knowing I'm not just like this bc I was somehow born defective but I became this way due to the way I was treated and being FA was a survival tactic.

From what the podcast said, he had it pretty rough growing up biracial in China and then dealing with racial discrimination in America. He was pretty hot headed as a teenager and was so against all the rules and decorum he thought were nonsense such as not allowing those who aren’t of pure Chinese descent to learn martial arts.

I want to be seen as a good person though so I’m gonna say I’m worried to look like a saint for ‘looking out’ for you and pretend it’s for your own well-being.” It’s a coward, self-serving tactic.

But with immature people, I definitely can get so triggered into fixing things and making them feel better at the expense of what I need bc I feel manipulated into not making them fall apart and thus upset them then and potentially lashing out at me in revenge.

I can’t block out the negatives and crave safety (which is really stagnancy in the long term) and also feel happy and present in my life and grow healthily. I am thankful that dissociation has helped me cope but when I find myself blocked from feeling happiness and love and connection to other people and myself... well, I do find that frustrating and sad.

Wish it could be that this is an ability that only blocks out the bad, that part is great, but that’s not how it is. And dissociation really means that I am not processing trauma which keeps it locked within me so I can’t move on. Ugh."
Dissociation,fpfyuqm,t3_gd8uts,1588588635.0,"Firstly, I’m sorry your mother treated you like that. I’ve had similar experiences so I also view dissociation as being helpful in those kinds of scenarios. It’s true that dissociation is a coping mechanism but it is born out of the freeze response when someone feels incapable of doing anything to stop or get away from an overwhelming situation. It helps you deal with stressful things in the moment but it does effectively block you from processing the stress/trauma which keeps it locked within your body. Keeping experiences/emotions/trauma buried ultimately is maladaptive and can keep you stuck in distress even if it feels like you’re coping and it’s not really ‘there.’ 

And unfortunately, people can’t selectively block out. Dissociation becomes a problem like when I’m feeling overwhelmed at all but still need to work through a situation. It is a problem that my subconscious tries too hard to block out the negatives so that all the positives are blunted too and my life doesn’t feel real so nothing matters anyway and I feel disconnected from everything including happiness and connection with other people. It keeps me safe but also stagnant..."
umineko,fpfw7p5,t3_gd61ns,1588585845.0,"cw: child abuse, suicide

I keep going over Umineko and being floored by the accuracy of the depictions of the child abuse and its ramifications into adulthood and mental health. I don't know if this is confirmed but I read somewhere that Ryukishi07 used to be a social worker. I believe it because all of his works are painfully true to life of how child abuse looks like and viscerally feels and how it continues to affect so much of someone's life.

Umineko is, at its root, a story about intergenerational abuse and trauma and how factors such as gender and wealth help perpetuate the cycle. Kinzo had some sort of childhood emotional wounds which led to his fixation on Beatrice in pursuit of ""love"" to fill his own unhappiness and entitlement over women and the power the gold gave him ultimately lead to the ruination of every other character's life. All of his children are broken from his abuse and manipulation and utter selfishness which set the stage for the murders on the island. Yes, they are desperate for money, but if they didn't all loathe each other from the start, it wouldn't have panned out like it did.

As despicable as Rosa is, I can't help but feel sorry for her in a way because she is a fundamentally broken woman who never could achieve any sort of happiness for herself and she took it out on her child who became a symbol of her misery, raging bitterness at the world, and self-hatred. Just like Kinzo. Maria really did her best by trying to remain optimistic and the trying to see the best in her mother despite everything; these are common tactics of a desperate, helpless child who cannot believe that her mother is abusive and that is not Maria's fault. But when Maria finally broke down and tried to get revenge on her mother by mentally enacting her murder but deep down still trying to believe that the abuse will pass and maybe she can forgive Rosa eventually... that's also the tactic of a desperate child who can not fight back.

This is already long but I could say the same thing about Ange and Sayo. Ange finally breaking down from Eva and her classmates' abuse and intense loneliness and desperation for the love of her family and being driven to suicidal despair was done so well. And of course, Sayo's whole story which was the culmination of Kinzo's sins through no fault of her own and eventual paralysis out of fear that there are no viable choices she can make without sheer disaster leading to suicidal despair as well... I'm just very saddened reading Umineko but also impressed by how detailed Ryukishi07 is when it comes to capturing the complexities of abuse and trauma. It is too easy to distill abusers into strictly evil terms but Ryukishi07 has this skill to carefully and empathetically grasp what goes into abuse, how it is learned, how much pain someone is in to enact abuse, but still not excusing how wrong they are and the damaging effects it has on its victims. And love isn't just about positive emotions but having the compassion to take the effort to really see someone fully and extend empathy for what shaped them but which is not the same thing as forgiveness though."

It's intimidating to speak up for myself from the get-go and even to acknowledge to myself that I do have my own needs bc I've been conditioned to believe I shouldn't have any but I have to notice the patterns here and it's simply reality that I can't keep bottling things up to the boiling point. I do not have infinite patience and a part of me really does want to be treated fairly even if it's buried deep within. I think I confuse being kind with just letting unacceptable behavior slide too much and that's not healthy either for me or the other person doing it.

But yes, the thing that really motivates me to change is how much bitterness and anger I have towards those who refused to be accountable for their actions towards me and sincerely apologize and sincerely make the effort to grow and sincerely consider me a full human being who they respect and try to acknowledge my perspective and feelings instead of getting defensive all the time. I truly loathed that. I have so much resentment towards those who only ever saw themselves as pure victims and thus justified to themselves they are free to be defensive, selfish assholes. Therefore, I don't want to be like that so I have to be the change I want to see and actively work towards being better than that even if it can be a hurtful, humbling process."
CPTSD,fpbdsa2,t3_gcejnp,1588467700.0,"I was going to make a post like this — I feel exhausted to the bone every single day. I’m sorry you’re also feeling like this, I also really feel you on the food thing. And I feel like people won’t understand and just will think I’m just a lazy scumbag who purposely is like this but I really am so exhausted just by living. I don’t know if I have an underlying medical condition other than mental illness stuff (although I do have suspicions) but if it’s ‘just’ the latter, I feel like people think that doesn’t count and I’m just lazy and weak. And maybe I am though, I don’t know how much my exhaustion compares to others, but I feel so overwhelmed by everything anyway. People can say it’s ok to just stay in bed but they just mean for like a weekend, not weeks spent mired in deep exhaustion and apathy and misery, paralyzed in bed. Ugh.

Anyway, I just want to say you’re not alone. And as someone with an eating disorder, I want to say you never have to ‘earn’ your meals. I know it’s hard though, I have felt the same way so many times especially when I also felt like I want to be dead anyway so what does eating matter? But it is okay to eat no matter your productivity level or how you feel.

I hope you feel better but I know that can seem so meaningless when you’re feeling this low. But I do hope this will pass for you."
CPTSD,fpb57fe,t3_gcf47v,1588462354.0,"Well, I don’t think it’s necessarily a natural skill to be a good listener. Lot of people weren’t taught how to do so. That doesn’t have to mean they don’t care, they just don’t know how to express it well. So I have been trying to instead appreciate other ways people try to help if they’re not good at listening/verbal support like taking time to hang out with me and just talk about random things to distract from Bad Brain Times. Not all friends are going to be able to support you in certain ways and that can be okay imo so long as it is felt that friends do care for you. But ofc if you want different, more explicit support, I would suggest bringing up that you would rather be validated in a certain way and you feel unheard when the other person isn’t there for you like that."
CPTSD,fpb3tcp,t3_gcdoy2,1588461522.0,"It’s common for people to adapt to their abusers’ mannerisms bc it’s all we’ve been modeled and we don’t yet know other ways of being or we’ve internalized that that’s the way for people to get their way bc it clearly worked for the abusers to get their way. I understand that that can be scary to realize but all we can do is try to unlearn them, grow, and take accountability when we screw up which will prove we’re not the same as the people who hurt us.

Personally, it was actually helpful to realize how some of my behaviors stem from abuse. Like I had an epiphany when I realized that I have anger issues bc I keep it real buried almost all the time and direct it to myself and didn’t realize until i lashed out at others that i do hold a lot of anger and others glimpsing it for a moment and getting rattled by it made me realize that oh god, I actually hate myself a whole lot. I am angry at myself a lot and if others are rattled by seeing a glimpse of it, then what does that say about how exhausting it must be for me to hold all this anger? It just really made me think. Plus, I caught myself thinking in that moment like “I am not even that angry why are people being so unreasonable I’ve dealt with so much more anger in my life so why is everyone else so weak” and it just shook me bc I keep denying I dealt with abuse at all but that made me realize that I /have/ dealt with a lot of anger directed at me and that’s not.... good. It may have been actually overwhelming not just for me, who I see as very weak, but maybe for anyone else to deal with too. So yeah... it’s just been strangely educational and kinda validating in a weird way. But yeah, now I have to work on not repeating the same traits/behaviors, I don’t want to perpetuate the same harm. I want to prove I am not the same as them."
CPTSD,fpb1j7o,t1_fpatpdu,1588460153.0,You described my experiences so well too; I do feel like there’s a glass shield between me and the rest of the world and like I’m viewing someone else’s life instead of experiencing it as mine. I have had brief instants where I felt present though and I guess it felt like that wall disappeared. I’m neither fixated by my emotions/ruminating thoughts (which is a form of dissociation too I think bc it’s still not being truly connected to yourself) or feeling like I’m fundamentally disconnected from other people. It just feels like I let things be a lot more simple instead of overthinking everything and I’m just in the moment and I know what I am feeling and I own that.
CPTSD,fpb0cs0,t3_gcbpvi,1588459455.0,Yeah. All the time. And mostly I feel ‘in touch’ with myself when I’m having strong emotions which is exhausting so I switch to dissociation. Dissociation is an effect of the freeze response which continues even if nothing is objectively wrong bc trauma is fun like that...
Dissociation,fpaz023,t3_gcdyoq,1588458657.0,"I feel you. I don’t really know who I am or if I’m ‘real’ or any of that or if I’ll ever stop feeling/thinking like this. But what’s been helping is trying to reframe this feeling of an internal void as not necessarily a bad thing. Emptiness can mean endless possibilities rather than eternal nothingness. Emptiness can be a blessing.  Think of someone who believes they’ve got themselves all figured out but are clearly mired in delusions and have an inflated sense of ego. Emptiness at least can mean open to all meanings of the self.

Another example is like a pot can be beautiful in its own right even when it’s in the default state of being empty but it does have the possibility of being filled up with something and thus having a set purpose but the state of non-purpose and non-identity isn’t the same thing as having non-value. I hope this makes sense."
books,fp5t9rh,t1_fp5qi7x,1588339395.0,I meant that it says at one point the servants did something to him that he considers the most despicable thing one can do to a child which I would say points to sexual abuse. I don’t think his parents were sexually abusive but it says in the epilogue that his problems in life originated with his father; hard to say if that means if he was abusive per se but even a merely strict parent can be hard on an especially sensitive child.
books,fp5hn8u,t3_g1hn5f,1588329731.0,"I believe that No Longer Human is semi-autobiographical and was written as a sort of confession and suicide note (Dazai committed suicide soon after writing it). Thus, I believe the narrator of the prologue and epilogue, who is sympathetic and seems to look at Yozo in a more objective light than he was ever capable of, was Dazai’s attempt to convince himself in a more objective manner that he still has worth no matter how much he hates himself and regrets his life. It’s not actually Dazai himself though bc he identifies too much with Yozo but it’s a sort of proxy anyway. The epilogue where the narrator talks about the notebooks with another acquaintance discusses how Yozo must have been suffering a lot and indeed had many mental health issues but others saw him as an angel really confirms this for me. I think it’s a common tactic for deeply depressed people to try to look at themselves through others’ eyes in an attempt to believe in their own self-worth and also common how their self-beliefs are distorted but it may not have been the real truth. Yozo (and thus Dazai) portrayed himself in the worst light but deeply depressed people can only see and believe in the worst of themselves but that’s almost never the full truth of someone and their life."
books,fp5g8b0,t3_g1g05l,1588328236.0,"There are a number of reasons why Yozo became so depressed in my view. One is his parents never modeled understanding and connection and seemed quite emotionally neglectful (and may have been abusive in other ways, particularly his father), so he felt like he must have been an alien and disconnected from others since he was born bc his own parents didn’t try to connect with him. He is also a very sensitive and astute child and the various hypocrisies of others around him and social norms in general seem absurd to him and accurately so in fact once you think about it (such as people saying his politician father made such a great speech in one context but talked shit behind his back in another and how everyone acts like being two-faced is how to get along in the world) and he just can’t accept why this is so. Plus, it’s implied he was sexually abused by the servants at a young age which would thus destroy any child’s trust in others. I believe that Yozo and Osamu Dazai himself (since the book is semi autobiographical) suffered from complex PTSD which explains so much of his behaviors and feelings such as timidity, alienation, fear and self-hatred. There’s also the consideration he grew up in a wealthy family of politicians so there must have been high expectations of him and him never feeling capable of living up to that contributed to his self-loathing. 

I’m not an expert on Japanese beliefs about suicide but I would guess it was something to do about bringing shame and scandal, again important bc of his family’s high status. It was reported in the news and there seemed to be some gossip about it especially bc it was an attempted double suicide with a married woman. He got out of it but it could’ve been speculated he tried to murder her so there’s that. 

I believe that his reaction to his wife’s rape makes the most sense if you see it as a reaction to his own sexual abuse history. Firstly, he was attracted to her in the first place bc her pure trust in others was beautiful to him as someone who was never able to trust others and hates himself. He believes her rape was a result of her pure trust leading to never being able to suspect others so she got taken advantage of. I believe this triggered some deep mourning for how he lost his own trust as a child due to never being able to say no to others and how he couldn’t save his wife from the same pain. I think he wonders if pure trust in others is a sin bc it seems to inevitably lead to harm and violation. I don’t believe he blames his wife though; he suffers as a result bc he knows it wasn’t her fault so he doesn’t know what to do about it. There is nothing he can do to erase what happened, she didn’t do anything wrong so he can’t either forgive or not forgive, but he is thrown into despair bc he wanted to believe trust in others is possible and he can run from his trauma but that became broken."
attachment_theory,fp5794z,t1_fp53wsq,1588318746.0,"This definitely sounds like FA. I'm sorry you went through all that in childhood and it makes sense that you developed FA attachment as a result. It's not true that FAs will ""never"" know secure attachment and we don't want to connect at all. We do, it's just terrifying. Even if it's buried deep inside and we can self-sabotage by doing the pushing and pulling, our desire for connection is half of what fuels the pushing and pulling in the first place."
attachment_theory,fp56zjx,t3_gb856l,1588318472.0,"I feel you a lot as a fellow FA. I would recommend Briana MacWilliam for guidelines on how to work towards secure attachment: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtC6J3ybDw\_I\_1oahIYIAoQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtC6J3ybDw_I_1oahIYIAoQ)

But I would suggest communicating with her your feelings. Try not to spill too much (you've only known her for a few weeks and I would say that's too soon to share too much about one's deep issues) so maybe write up a letter beforehand and evaluate what would seem appropriate to tell her but enough so that she has an idea why you're doing these behaviors. Let her know that it's not her doing but you struggle with certain things but you do care about this relationship. 

But also its ok to be gentle with yourself. It's so hard for FAs to open up and be stable in our relationships. It's okay to need your space at times. Intimacy and feeling safe in relationships is like a muscle that FAs need to exercise; we have reasons why that muscle is atrophied but it can get stronger with effort. Open up a little bit at a time and over time, it'll hopefully get easier. Good luck!"
attachment_theory,fp55u6l,t3_gbbwcv,1588317311.0,"I'm FA and honestly can understand where your partner is coming from. I understand your own frustrations toward it too though. I'm sorry and it's even harder if your partner just fights when you want to discuss matters instead of listening and communicating. Personally, I can try to be understanding of a lot of flaws but refusing to communicate effectively and being ultra defensive all the time is something I can't stand (although I do understand I can be like this too at times, hah. I'm trying to work on it though).

I will just suggest trying not to take it too personally. You are of course allowed to be frustrated etc but you do not have to hold yourself responsible for your partner's flaws and maladaptive tendencies. It is very very scary for FAs to open up bc of some kind of trauma in our past where opening up to people meant being hurt deeply. Vulnerability = harm and even abuse for us. But we also don't like ourselves so we can't be content with just being by ourselves like the dismissive avoidants so we do also crave relationships. I know it can seem really confusing on the outside but tbf that's bc our internal experience is also chaotic and contradictory. 

None of this means you have to put up with bad behavior though. You are free to feel whatever you want and please don't feel obligated to stay with them or abandon yourself and your own needs to change them. I do believe that healthy relationships can be a place of healing for FAs but only so long as we are willing to put in the work ourselves too. But it seems like you realize you have your own issues to deal with as you say you are Anxious Preoccupied and APs can trigger FAs and vice versa if we are unaware of own proclivities.

I feel really bad when I see people complain about those who won't involve themselves enough in the relationship enough bc I wonder if that's how people see me.

It also feels like people just want me to deal with my own anger away from them (regardless of what THEY did to spark it) and then they can take the results when I try to get better and just be more positive around them.

I don’t know if I’m actually coping. I do think I have tried a lot in the past year to be more open with people which has helped ... but I have also messed up a lot which I feel has made people alienated by me. People have told me they want me around, I deserve love, they think I’m cool etc but I don’t really believe them and all my bad actions must cancel everything out? And I feel I’m unacceptable in some ways bc people around me have their own quirks which clash with mine and I don’t know if they like that about me. tbh I’m not sure how to proceed from here... I feel like a black hole and nothing external will really reassure me that I’m worthy bc I don’t believe I’m worth it. Which means I need to work on self-acceptance/love, huh. Ugh.

attachment_theory,fp204wq,t3_gaini2,1588252266.0,"Honestly I would say a lot of these apply to APs as well such as overthinking relationships and incorrectly interpreting motives, it’s just that presentation is different.

However, here are some traits I would say  are anxious:

Fantasies about enmeshment but actual emotional availability is intimidating.

Rescue fantasies/dreaming the love of another will save them from themselves but doesn’t know what to do when real love presents itself.

The thrill of the chase is more important than stability.

Manipulating others when they don’t give you want you want.

Tends to present themselves as a victim, blames others for not living up to their standards, doesn’t reflect how they contribute to a problem. 

Expects people to mind read instead of communicating.

Confuses enmeshment and oversharing and clinginess as being open and vulnerable and friendly instead of what is really is, projection and forcing intimacy.

Gives in order to receive and resents when people don’t give back as much as they want.

Prioritizes relationships at the expense of everything else but fails to realize how this is self-sabotaging and taxing on others.

Thinks they are being selfless and caring but fail to actually consider what the other person needs; at the root, they want to be taken care of, not actually committed to loving someone else. 

Presents as helpful but can actually be controlling and demanding."

I would suggest asking to talk about it and communicating your feelings that you feel like he is angry at you and how you feel about it. With avoidants/avoidant leaning FAs, it can be that we are afraid of confrontation and rejection and withdrawing seems like the only option to ‘keep the peace.’ That probably seems strange on the outside and yes people are allowed to be frustrated by it but I just want to put it out there that it’s possible people really don’t know this is frustrating to others.

Are there any free/low cost support groups in your area? Any community mental health/disability centers? Maybe not the same as therapy but being around people with similar issues may help. And not the same thing as therapy but I have found free therapeutic content online such as CBT and DBT resources. Books, workbooks, and academic research have also helped me.

I try to frame it as like I don’t expect others to earn their keep around me and if people actually did expect that, that is unfair and selfish of them. But I still can’t shake the feeling.

But I really would have preferred to read more diverse authors such as Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, and Amy Tan. ""Speak"" by Laurie Anderson would also have been great especially as a comparison to ""Catcher in the Rye.""

I also think it would have been neat to have been able to read graphic novels; I have heard of some teachers implementing this in their criteria since GNs are popular now. I would recommend ""Maus"" by Art Spiegelman, ""Persepolis"" by Marjane Satrapi, ""Fun Home"" by Alison Bechdel.

I know I can't change people. I know I can't make them do anything. I don't know how to proceed either in this situation except just distance myself from them and try to validate my *own* feelings. Even if no one else agrees with me, I am allowed to be upset. I don't *need* other people's permission and validation to feel upset about how I was treated. I want it anyway but I'm trying to change my thinking. But ugh.

But I do have people in my life who will calmly and rationally engage with me in conflict which has given me a lot of perspective. So here's some advice: I try to observe how a person reacts to criticism and conflict before getting in too deep a relationship. If they always have this defensive air about them, then that's a red flag. If they can calmly react in most disagreements, then that's a good sign. If they are willing to be accountable for their actions and apologize sincerely when they mess up, then that's a great sign. Unfortunately, I still tend to get involved with emotionally immature people bc I do really want to see the best in people and try to allow for mistakes bc I know damn well I mess up a lot and wish other people would allow for that and be compassionate about it. But I don't know, I'm just tired now. Anyway, solidarity. I'm sorry this happened to you and I wish you were treated better."
CPTSDFightMode,fotbivb,t1_fos4ts7,1588049294.0,Yes. I almost prefer it when people lash out bc at least it seems more straightforward how to deal with that directness and I know where I stand with that person. Passive aggression is sneakier and it creates mind games and it seems harder to confront and thus resolve bc there’s wiggle room for the other person to deny anything’s happening (so you’re just the ‘crazy’ one for reacting). I really can’t stand that.
CPTSD,fot9wcu,t1_foqwyfv,1588048108.0,I didn’t really think of freezing like that before but you’re so right. I do think of myself as relatively easygoing in a lot of situations some others would probably find stressful and perhaps more willing to let some things slide than a lot of other people but ugh... I realize now that a lot of that has to do with the freeze response. Thanks for your comment.
Dissociation,fot96j6,t1_fos2v69,1588047590.0,Thank you! I’ll look into all of this.
BPD,foqjyc6,t3_g8jvs5,1587995241.0,"I also don't have BPD myself but know people who do and I deal with other mental health issues which includes emotional dysregulation and relationship problems so I can relate in a sense and agree the stigma for BPD is huge compared to most other mental health issues. pwBPD seem like an easy scapegoat at times and people treat it as an overly generalized label and if they meet one pwBPD they don't like, then everyone else with the condition is the same. I've met people with other psychiatric issues who were more difficult to handle and empathize with and just plain toxic. I've also met people with no clinical mental health issues be way more toxic and also get way with more shit bc they're supposedly ""normal"" so they think they don't have to work on themselves and it's only ever ""crazies"" who are the problem. I don't see a point in looking at someone as just a cluster of symptoms and not as an individual who struggles with certain things. You can never truly generalize who is going to be toxic and unforgivable based on a label.

Plus, I suspect BPD is at least partly stigmatized bc it seems like more women are diagnosed with it. It fits a lot of stereotypes of ""difficult"" women who are maligned societally ie highly emotional, not compliant, and willful unlike ""good"" women who are docile, always restrain themselves for others' sakes, and never impose on others with their own needs. Not to say that men with BPD don't face stigma either. But things that are mainly associated with women generally get poorer reception from everything from hobbies, media, to careers. Things like ADHD are more associated with men and things like anxiety disorders and depression are pretty gender neutral which I would claim helps with those things being seen less harshly at least a bit. We know how things like hysteria was seen as a woman-only disorder for instance and how that was maligned."
Dissociation,foq7qbl,t3_g7mxgf,1587985948.0,Thanks for posting. I feel like this all the time...
Dissociation,foq5yqj,t3_g8dyss,1587984207.0,Thank you for posting. This is definitely a problem I have and explains a lot of my dissociation/DPDR issues.
CPTSD,fopwtt5,t3_g8nlw4,1587974803.0,"Yeah, same. ‘Flashback hangovers’ is a great way to explain it, I’m gonna use this too. I also have chronic amnesia from dissociation and finding myself not feeling like recent days even existed. I don’t really have any advice here beyond grounding techniques for dealing with dissociation and all that but you’re not alone."
CPTSD,fopw45f,t1_fonyny7,1587974100.0,"Oof, yeah. Absolutely. I’ve noticed that too unfortunately when these sorts of people say they feel a connection with me...  it really is at least partly bc I have had weak boundaries and they feel like they can get away with shit with me that other people wouldn’t tolerate in the first place, huh. “No one else has treated me like this before for no reason bc there is nothing wrong with me so you’re special” like nah, people don’t want to be close to you bc they don’t want to be taken advantage of..."
CPTSD,fopvjd0,t1_fonttuv,1587973545.0,"Yeah, I feel this a lot. Like I had a wake-up call when I realized it’s not actually being empathetic when I let people dump upsetting stuff like self harm on me w/o warning whenever they feel upset and try to soothe them. I realized I was enabling them by making it seem like it’s ok to dump shit on others and hold them responsible for their own feelings or else they’re going to hurt themselves, not just to me but in their other relationships. That’s not being empathetic, that’s coddling bad behavior that will negatively affect other people too so it’s up to me to not enable that sorta stuff. 

And yeah, I agree that that kind of people pleasing is manipulative. I try to not to be a dick but it’s important for me to at least not feign i feel a connection with someone. And when someone did that to me and they had no remorse over screwing me over and talking shit about me and acting like I was in the wrong for ‘forcing’ them to be pleasant to me... ugh. It is hard for me to trust people as it is. And when I saw someone I know (a clear fawn type) confess to never liking a mutual friend even though they always acted pleasantly to them, that really knocked down my respect for them a lot. I understand why people do this sorta stuff bc trauma responses but it really is self-centered and cowardly. 

Anyway that’s great that you’ve been working on these issues. It’s not easy to realize how these behaviors that you think are being nice are actually unhealthy."
CPTSD,fopui4p,t1_fonmjx4,1587972558.0,I’m sorry these people treated you like this. What assholes. I really feel you on being unsure of my own perspective and it’s very tempting to just go along with what others say about me bc I’ve been conditioned to think I’m a bad person no matter what. It’s not fair that people can be so selfish and have all these double standards.
Codependency,fopskbu,t3_g8r8aw,1587970747.0,"I used to really let it slide when people would dump upsetting things on me w/o any warning. Now I’m adamant on having people ask me before talking about certain things and I refuse to be guilt tripped if I say no. I say no, they need to back off, the conversation then moves on. No harm, no foul, but I need the space. Also I tell people on social media to warn for certain things before talking about them or it’s just going to be an unfollow or mute."
BPD,foloxo1,t1_folf946,1587867062.0,"Yeah, I also have emotional outbursts so I can relate and it has taken me a lot of work to be able to change and have more productive, open constructive conflicts. So I get that it can be hard to change and I’m not perfect by any means... but I have to question it when people act like there’s no reason why other people should feel like they need to act on eggshells and they should just ‘know’ to be straightforward with them. Like sure other people could be immature about communication too but if it’s a recurring problem... maybe look inward into why people assume they can’t be straightforward. How do you actually react when people being up issues to you? How do you actually come off to people regardless of your intentions? Like even though you might not feel like you’re defensive and you’re just being open, are you really? What kind of expectations do you have from criticism that can breed defensiveness and react out of your woundedness rather than receiving calmly the other person’s words? How do you behave after receiving criticism ie withdrawal, more irritable, more critical of others, passive aggressive? Etc...

Also congrats to working hard on yourself!"
books,folg2uq,t3_g53gtd,1587861472.0,In Our Time is a podcast by the BBC that brings in a lot of experts to talk pretty in-depth on a variety of topics including literature. I enjoy it and think they do provide lot of interesting analysis.
ptsd,fojm3qi,t3_g7q9dw,1587824382.0,"I feel the same... dissociation has helped me through a lot. But it’s also held me back a ton. It is what is, my brain is trying to help me and that’s cool and I can thank myself for doing that. But the sad thing is that people can’t block out emotions selectively. I can’t feel happiness or positive emotions that well bc I block out my negative emotions so much through dissociation. Like it was weird when I was going through an objectively happy experience, I felt completely blocked from actually feeling happy. I felt like I /should/ be happy but I just felt blank and like none of it was actually real. That can be helpful when I’m going through something bad but... it does really hold me back too."
BPD,fojldcd,t3_g7tkqn,1587823882.0,"I feel like I may have been the ‘FP’ or something like that for someone and it’s not all that pleasant to be on the receding end. I mean, I try to be understanding but I don’t see all that fixation as flattering and it makes me feel smothered and that I am obligated to return feelings as intensely or I’m responsible for the other person having a meltdown. I can try to be compassionate why people do the fixation and all that but yeah, at the very least I do not think it’s good to glamorize having a FP and act like it’s indicative of being highly loving to do so. Love isn’t about viewing other people through such polarizing, dependent lens."
CPTSD,fojjpiw,t3_g7imtg,1587822712.0,"Yeah, same. It has been helpful for me though in a way when I explore my anger... like when I feel like I’m getting real pissed off and ask myself why I’m feeling like this, it can yield some interesting ideas. Like recently I was feeling irritable bc I felt like someone was refusing to listen to me and it’s not fair that i get cast sometimes as a bitch for not being perfectly cordial. I see how this stems from feeling unheard so much of my life which means I don’t feel like I matter at all and I’m loathsome for defending myself from unfair treatment. So that tells me something about myself. But also ... interesting ... when I explore my anger and think I’m being quite reasonable but then I realize that I look quite angry to others and I don’t feel it’s that bad bc I’ve experienced so much worse. But then that means that I’ve experienced a lot of anger directed at me, right? Which is something to dwell on bc I still have a lot of trouble accepting I dealt with abuse all that much."
CPTSDFightMode,fojheu1,t3_g7kdnr,1587820969.0,"Yeah, I also process a lot how intergenerational and learned abuse can be. It’s given me a lot of perspective for what I’ve gone through; doesn’t make anything ‘right’ but i think it saves me a bit of mental grief. And in a broader sense, I believe it would be much more realistic and productive when dealingwith the effects of abuse and ending abuse through exploring these shades of grey and why people are the way they are instead of binary models of good/evil. This does not mean excusing or forgiving anything, I don’t believe people should be forced to do so against those who hurt them. But I know that such binary thinking has hurt me and made me feel irredeemable for not fitting into someone else’s standards and my individuality denied about me so I know the fallacies. 

I also agree that there really is a rigid expectation for ‘good’ abuse survivors to be perfectly meek and passive all the time and if you’re not, you get little leeway... but fawn types really aren’t as ‘nice’ as they and many non-abuse survivors seem to think they are. I’ve seen many be incredibly passive aggressive and manipulative and force their way out of accountability bc of some selfish excuses and it’s maddening that they still think of themselves as ‘good’ people who can never hurt others bc they don’t get ‘angry’ and they’re so ‘loving’ and they were victims so that means they’re incapable of hurting others. I mean, I also can be a fawn type at times and I recognize that this is all a learned response from trauma but there is no one right way to be an abuse survivor and no one is immune from doing toxic behaviors and from accountability. Everyone can hurt others even unintentionally and denying that you have the capacity to be wrong and hurtful bc you’ve been hurt and/or bc you’re not a fight type is immature and self-centered and can even turn abusive which is the greatest shame. It’s not only fight types that are capable of harm."
CPTSDFightMode,fojf484,t1_foieks8,1587819096.0,"I agree, I also think it’s at minimum a bit uncomfortable when people are so confident that they can read everyone super accurately. I mean, I can get it bc I’m also hyper vigilant and think I can read people well a lot of the time, but I am also aware of how my triggers and blind spots and biases can cloud my judgment in negative ways. I know I’m not perfect; I try to balance listening to my intuition about people with acknowledgment that I can fuck up and need to own up for my actions due to my mistaken judgment. We are all just human and prone to error more often than not and claiming like we have some kinda infallible reasoning that’s inherent to us seems egocentric if not downright judgmental in the long run. 

I’m also sensitive to people not giving me room for error and right to think for myself and it honestly ticks me off when other abuse survivors assume that they have the right to deny my individuality bc of their own issues. It’s selfish and I think people can refuse to see that bc unfortunately, people can be so defensive about this bc they’ve been denied agency and control and had their self-esteem beaten down for so long that they want to protect their egos and their sense of self as ‘good’ people.... but it’s still fundamentally selfish and it just perpetuates further cycles of dysfunction which is everyone’s responsibility to not do."

AskReddit,foajprl,t1_foa2gut,1587647788.0,I’m also Korean and it just seems more satisfying to swear/vent anger in korean lol. I don’t know how to explain it but I think there’s just something about how the language sounds that makes it more cutting.
CPTSD,fo9dz44,t1_fo9cfng,1587616921.0,"Yeah, I usually feel responsible in conflicts even when I feel I was justified too so I have the compulsion to at least say sorry for upsetting the other person. And then I look back and was like “wait, why did I even say that? It wasn’t even my fault!”

Also, I don’t know if you’re a woman, but it’s also common for many women to say sorry a lot, I’ve noticed. I think it has a lot to do with trying to make ourselves more appealing to others and to seem nice and unobtrusive."
CPTSD,fo9bkmm,t3_g6dp2d,1587615170.0,"Yeah, I get this urge too. For me, when it gets like this, it’s tied a lot to feeling like whatever triggered it means my existence must be a burden to everyone around me all the time rather than seeing it as one mistake I made. And tbh probably also bc to stave off excessive criticism/prevent escalation; I’m just used to being attacked for every fault disproportionately to the situation and I guess if I emphasize how much I regret something, I feel like I’m less likely to get attacked for it? So trying not to catastrophize and just see it as a mistake or temporary bad feeling state and consciously limiting saying I’m sorry only once has helped... but I still struggle with this."
CPTSD,fo8yms5,t3_g69v6e,1587606622.0,"Yeah, I feel the same re: hypocrisy and performative niceness. Although I  try to be lenient generally bc I know very well I have my own blind spots and own hypocrisies, I can’t help but feel repulsed by it at times. It’s one thing if people are at least semi-aware of their issues and try to work on them/open to criticism, I really can’t stand it though when people act self-righteous and act like they’re such nice people who can do no wrong and it’s only other people who have these issues who are bad and take criticism/feedback as an affront. my stance on this has gotten me a lot of resentment I feel bc I want to try to be fair to everyone as much as possible and transparent about my intentions around other people which is fine when its directed towards themselves but when I try to be fair to others, lot of people tend to get affronted bc they feel I’m not on ‘their side’ and confronting them on their two-facedness. It’s just tiresome. Im not perfect by any means but the degree to which people pretend they’re immune to self-awareness and accountability can be depressing to me and I feel like even a lot of other trauma survivors don’t respect my desire for transparency and honesty."
CPTSD,fo5y46u,t1_fo3o53m,1587539551.0,"Yeah, I do have triggers that do that and it's hard to come out of it and it can get frustrating esp when it happens like someone is being emotional in any way and/or directing positive feelings towards me and expects me to mirror back or react and I just can't do it... I have to use cognitive empathy/remember basic social cues then so I don't cause offense but I really just feel nothing at all during those times.

I've never done drugs largely bc I'm worried that they will trigger worse psychiatric issues so yeah that's definitely not the cause. It's weird though because logically I know that chronic depersonalization and derealization arise due to trauma but I don't consider my trauma to have been that 'severe.' Ah well, it is what it is.

CPTSD,fo2o6nm,t3_g5arav,1587469456.0,"If we are denied unconditional love and proper amount of guidance in childhood, then we inevitably grow up feeling lost about our identity and feel difficulty in believing in ourselves and what we want.
