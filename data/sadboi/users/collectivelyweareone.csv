mentalillness,f9m5ejm,t3_e5o9pa,1575442259.0,"I voluntary addmitted myself in June of this year. Make the best of it while you there. Ask as many questions as you can, talk very openly about your issues. ask about coping mechanisms this will help you while you having a next episode. Talk about pills your being prescribed and what are the side effects of those pills. Try to get into group sessions if theres any or if you can get into drumming this helped me alot.

Remember your given this opportunity which most people and most countries dont have, despite of the circumstances you are there know so make the best of it. 

One thing that really helped me while I was in psych ward was this community on reddit. So stay connected theres much love and support here.

Remember your strong for taking this step, much love and sending you positive energy."

witchcraft,f9cvask,t1_f980zwf,1575227661.0,"I was in the same boat. I never knew people can cast a spell to harm other human beings. I never knew witches existed. I thought everyone was like me I gave out love, i am helpful to people around me, i am polite honest genuine kind sincere etc etc, until 3 years ago when several people whom I considered family cast a spell on me or used some kind of dark magic, it ruin my life entirely, my life was torn apart, my life was flipped up side down, I lossed everything, I lossed my job, my sanity, I started seeing things, I almost became homeless, I ended up in psych ward, my dad passed away...üòü
like seriously I had no glue about this kind of stuff,I was so so naive Haha, BELIEVE ME PEOPLE CAN HARM YOU JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO, they can cast a spell so nobody wants to be friends with you. They can totally ruin your life. You just try to heal from the truma like this which I dont think is possible but you try and everyday is a struggle. you also got to understand after going through experiences like this you are never the same person again. You forget to laugh and just try to fit in because one will ever understand what you went through. 

I hope everything works out for ya. Much love."

I feel this pain all the time when I am around my family all the time and around some friends as well. I go for mindful walk, I try to release all negative energy to the universe. I just cant handle this pain anymore which makes me really sick I ended up in hospital once already. I also feel so bad and guilty by talking about my family but this what I observed when I am around them I am always in pain or when they lie to my face I always sense it, so sometimes I lose my cool because I know what are they doing and then everything ends up in an argument.

I am no expert but I have been going through some tuff times as well,not long ago all I wanted to do is to die. You are stronger then you know. You have to find that strength and light that is in you, get hold of it and use it to dig yourself out of this negative rabbit hole or the thought patterns that we get ourselves into. Ofcourse its easier said then done but there are some good tools on youtube that you can use such listening to alan watts, abraham  hicks, maybe try guided meditation on you tube it's hard at first but try sitting down for 10 mins everyday to quite your mind. Have you seen a therapist or someone professional to talk to, it always helps just to talk to someone and let it all out. I understand your pain and know how hard this can be but you are stronger than you know. You got this I believe in you and most importantly believe in your self,  just dont give up.  you are welcome to DM me if you want to chat. Best of luck."

You should not invalidate anyone else's  experience by calling it ""bullshit"". That's pretty low of you and that's why you dont deserve any respect. All you doing in this post is  defending yourself rather than seeing or understanding others pain,truma and  perspective. Maybe you can learn to recognize each individual have their own truma and pain and how they deal with it depending on the support that they have at present or maybe they dont have any support. So they post here to get some support and understanding then theres people like you who just calls others experience bullshit is not nice. You can't call anyone else  experience bullshit without knowing any back story. It's about having courtesy to understand and validate others experiences. Thank you."
