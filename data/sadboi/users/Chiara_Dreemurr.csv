I know they have to be carful and make sure the children they are taking care of during the day aren't being abused at home....but I feel they should have gotten more ""evidence"" than just a small bruise.

 Nearly the same thing happened with my dad and little brother a few years back

Edit: also....isn't it bad to confront a possible abuser like that? Like....say they confronted an actual abuser like that after a kid said that someone had beat them....and they left after not getting enough evidence....the kid would be in trouble with the abuser for telling someone..... I seriously think they should have gone a different route with it"
