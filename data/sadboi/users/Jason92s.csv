Now, it's important to note that US ranks 38th out of 212 countries/territories in terms of how much testing it does, so that's a good sign. We're making significant progress!

To break this down fatrher, just 1 in 20,762 people have Covid and the death rate is at 1 in 627,032.

Anxiety,fpecphp,t3_fnz5n3,1588544910.0,"Hey all, just want to share something that may be helpful to others with health anxiety.  Like many, I've been on a roller coaster of emotions for the past few months.  Fortunately, early on I discovered this subreddit after only spending time on the one that we all know about that focuses on the negative stuff.  Anyway, I was doing really good for about 4 weeks straight, never went back to the other site.  Then, last Sunday, I figured I'd go check it out.  Huge mistake.   The last 6 days were pure hell.  Just gonna be honest with you all--I started down a very dark path, drinking, taking excessive pain meds, and lashing out at my family and friends.   Then late last night, I started running some numbers and really looking at the statistics.  Statistically speaking, my odds are pretty damn low of getting it based on my research, and even lower of dying from it.  That other subreddit just focuses on anomalies, outliers, and anything else that can generate clicks or promote fear.  I did find some useful information, but navigating through the crap and seeing most of the titles did little for my anxiety other than to let me spiral out of control.  Now that I'm back here, I feel much calmer and in control.  Anyway, I said all this in the hopes than anyone else considering venturing to the other subreddit thinks twice because this one is where we should all be spending our time.  Great people here, no wars of words, no fighting, just people living with anxiety trying to come together and support each other while this virus gets its ass kicked and we say we overcame it all."

Anxiety,flgpqo1,t1_flgpgf1,1585147878.0,I came here after just seeing that article too.  Hoping beyond hope there‚Äôs a good explanation.
Anxiety,flesin8,t1_flef1en,1585090657.0,"A good friend of mine texted me the following a few hours ago:

""my daughter , son in-law and gkids are in Germany. They have just enforced fines of 15,000- 25,000 euro to anyone not following their strict guidelines. 

They are not allowed to be around anyone expect their immediate family . They can go to the grocery store, get out for exercise. Parks are roped off. They are serious about this virus"""
Anxiety,flbwy37,t1_fla6aa4,1585014530.0,Couldn‚Äôt agree more!!
Anxiety,flaxmu3,t1_fla89vv,1584993197.0,"This!!  Very well put, and you're spot on."
Anxiety,fl91ekl,t1_fl8vnmk,1584937992.0,I felt the same way just an hour ago.  Went up and started watching a movie with the kids and when I saw your post I realized those feelings were gone.  Anxiety can definitely mess with us. Find something to take your mind off it for just a little while and you‚Äôll soon realize it was the anxiety. Best to you internet friend.
Anxiety,fl917jc,t1_fl8zsu9,1584937829.0,It‚Äôs made such a huge improvement in my life as well. Focusing on the positive news stories (and there are a LOT of them) has completely changed my outlook and given me so much hope.
Anxiety,fl7mrvv,t1_fl7lyt8,1584904978.0,"Definitey good news!  And keep in mind, Italy and France have populations of 60 and 67 million people, respectively.  We've got this people!"
Anxiety,fl66dij,t1_fl6014w,1584855952.0,Thank you so much for this.
Anxiety,fl6680a,t1_fl60pqq,1584855803.0,Totally appreciate this post.  I‚Äôve been unable to sleep tonight  and after reading this a wave of calmness just came over me.  Thank you for all that you are doing kind stranger.
Anxiety,fl31fm5,t1_fl2v0w4,1584765768.0,"Sounds like you did everything correctly.  Stay strong friend, hope you enjoyed the pizza and keep enjoying the game."
Anxiety,fl2tvgi,t1_fl2mso2,1584759774.0,You‚Äôre welcome. If the media would just do more of these stories I think many of us here would be in a much better place.
Anxiety,fl2mpe7,t3_eupik4,1584754704.0,"Just wanted to share a good news story.  We know a pastor near Seattle, Washington who is in his 60‚Äôs.  He is a super nice man and performed the funeral for my father in law a few years back.  Well, he tested positive a few weeks ago but we just learned he was released from the hospital tonight!   I‚Äôd personally like to see more stories like this as we all know this outcome is far more likely that the worst case."
Anxiety,fkzuw2y,t1_fkzu82f,1584681110.0,My pleasure.   Feel free to message me anytime if you‚Äôd like to chat. We‚Äôre gonna make this!
Anxiety,fkztorg,t1_fkzt6e2,1584680051.0,"Hey I get it.  We‚Äôre in the same boat with anxiety but you know what, we also are here to support each other.  Feel free to message me anytime if you wanna chat."
Anxiety,fkztl3d,t1_fkzlyjy,1584679964.0,"In California too, but our governor is on this.  Trust in him regardless of which side of the aisle you‚Äôre on.  And try to limit your internet searching.  It has helped me a lot in the last week.  If it‚Äôs something you REALLY need to know, trust me, you will get the info. There are a lot of dark rabbit holes out there, we need to stay away from them.  You‚Äôre gonna be ok my friend."
Anxiety,fkztda3,t1_fkzmogj,1584679780.0,"Yep, maybe a month or two to get this under control.  Definitely not years.  There are some brilliant scientists working on finding a vaccine for us. You‚Äôre gonna make it my friend."
Anxiety,fkzt68h,t1_fkzqcyj,1584679618.0,"I‚Äôve been in your place recently.  I just have to take a step back and try to think about the numbers and statistics.  I visualize dealing out 100 cards and then think what are the chances that if I pick 2 or 3 cards I‚Äôll draw a specific card.  Well, it‚Äôs pretty darn slim so you know what, my chances are just as slim of this taking me down.  Stay strong friend, you‚Äôre gonna come thru this ok."
Anxiety,fkzsyjo,t1_fkzs5p1,1584679441.0,Nothing wrong with that.  I did it the other night on my drive home from my last day at work. Crying is emotionally healthy so let it out my friend.
Anxiety,fkzsw51,t1_fkzsj2k,1584679384.0,I hear ya.  I‚Äôm reassured to see stores doing online shopping and deliveries too. Just saw our sporting goods store will take your order and take to your car in the parking lot. We‚Äôre gonna get they this folks.
