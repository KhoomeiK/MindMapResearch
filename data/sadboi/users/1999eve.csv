I would recommend really paying attention during class and reading the book inside out. One time she asked a question about a FUN FACT on the side of a chapter page. I only got it right because I’m a dummy who likes reading those but a lot of the class got it wrong because they neglected it.

In regards to healthcare, it’s extremely expensive, but if you have good insurance it’s not. My brother had surgery last year and besides the copay (a few hundred dollars), it was completely covered by insurance. All of our doctor, eye and dental appointments are covered. Insurance virtually covered all 4 of the births my parents had. My dad has diabetes and his insurance covers insulin. 

College is expensive. That I extremely agree. But if you’re smart, do community college cuz it’s the same. My sister did 2 years community and 2 years online while working and only had a 2-3 thousand in debt that she paid off in a year. I’m lucky cuz I got a full ride scholarship so college is free for me.

I guess maternity leave depends on your jo. My mom had 8 months maternity leave and every teacher I had who had a baby got about 6 months.
