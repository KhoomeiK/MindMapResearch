depression,eyie6ar,t3_cwt34b,1567101205.0,"Yes. I’m using citalopram and it brought me back to life in general, but i honestly feel like i’m always just one step away from being all depressed and suicidal again. Like i’m walking on a tightrope each and everyday: i’m doing good, but i could fall anytime. Even though i enjoy my life so much more than a year ago, i still feel like deep down there’s no purpose of life. We just got here in this nonsensical world so arbitrarily, and we are forced to enjoy it. So yeah, i do have something to live for, i guess, but deep down nothing really matters."
depression,eyic3o7,t1_eyd6f61,1567100337.0,"damn, this happened to me. I got diagnosed HPV when i was 18 and for years i didn’t go to any doctor because i just wanted to die and blame it on cancer. I kept smoking, drinking, working a lot and sleeping so little. I’m a very functional/social depressive person so a lot of people would never think that deep down i wanted to die. A year ago (i was 25) i finally started using antidepressants (citalopram) and it made me feel SO much better (even with the weird vivid dreams). I met my actual partner and we got engaged so i finally decided it was time to go see a doctor. If not for me at least for him. I was terrified but it turns out i don’t have HPV anymore. Honestly, even with the antidepressants I still think dying is easier than living, and life is stupid and nonsense, but i guess i’m trying to enjoy because i’m already here. It’s a very contradictory feeling, like if i’m fooling myself on purpose, but it works. most of the times."
