> Our son and his boyfriend have been together for several years, since they were freshmen in college. They both came to stay with us when their campus closed. His boyfriend was disowned by his family for being gay so we've always been happy to welcome him into our home.

> Last night or I guess really early this morning, around 4 am, I woke up and my husband wasn't in bed. I just assumed he was in the bathroom or something. I got up to get some water. When I opened the door I saw him right outside our son's bedroom which is next to our's. He sleeps shirtless in boxers, and his boxers were pushed down in the front. He scrambled to pull them up but I was able to clearly see he had a boner. He had jumped in a startled way when I opened the door, and as he tugged his boxers up he started whispering angrily at me asking what I was doing. I was really confused and a bit in shock. I just said I was going to get water, what was HE doing?? He said, ""nothing, couldn't sleep, it was too hot, is that a problem?""

> I didn't say much in response, just got my water and went back to bed. He never came to bed and I assume slept on the couch in the basement where his office is. He's been down there all day today. He's working from home but never just shuts himself away like this. The door is closed and he said he was on a call when I asked to talk. I also sent him a text asking if he was okay, he said yeah just busy, then I said I want to talk about what he was doing last night and he hasn't opened it.

> I'm disturbed that his penis was out. Why would that be unless he was masturbating and why would he do that at 4am outside our son's door? If they were having sex I didn't hear anything, but they could have easily gone quiet after my husband started whispering to me in the hall.

> I'm deeply creeped out and while they are adults, he's still my husband's CHILD, who spys on their own kid to see if they're having sex? Who'd want to see that? As long as my son keeps it private and I'm none the wiser I don't give a crap if he has sex while here. My husband has never expressed any disagreement to that. So why go seeking it out? Is he gay? Is there any explanation besides spying that I'm not thinking of?

> I also would like advice on whether I should tell my son. If they were in fact having sex he'd be mortified, he's a very shy modest person. Is it a case of what he doesn't know won't hurt him or would you want that knowledge if it was your privacy being intruded?

uj/ What did you use to cry about? I've been crying about the rapes and the mistreatment. Trying to grapple with how and why it all happened. Also been crying because my life has been at a standstill since 2017 so I feel like a loser because of that. I think I've been having mood swings since I started therapy. It alternates between crying or feeling happy or feeling nothing.

How long did you go for? Did you do it off-and-on or were you committed for a bunch of years? I've only had four sessions and I already have abandonment anxiety. I dread that maybe I'll recover too fast and then I'll have to stop seeing her.

I used to think I was self-reflective and self-aware but apparently not. It's just too painful to really look at yourself and try to decipher what's going on.

Did you end up so early in therapy because you're Jewish? I've heard that it's very common among American Jews to be in therapy. That it's almost thrown around as a joke in conversation in Jewish circles: ""Get some fucking therapy, goddamnit!""

> A masculine man is free from this bullshit.

> What I envy is not the perceived masculinity of the gay guy but rather his ability to socially integrate. It's the ability of the masculine guy to get into a straight marriage and present a normal front to the world that I envy.

> Due to being put down all the time, feminine guys usually have low self-esteem and suffer from some strain of self-hatred.

> What can be a confidence boost is the man loving me back. On some level, it validates my identity as a man. It strokes my ego. I think ""a real man wants me so I might be a man after all"".
