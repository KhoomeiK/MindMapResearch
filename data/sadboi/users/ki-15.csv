It doesn‚Äôt even matter about your situation. My parents were poor now they are middle class. Do you think this makes them happy? No. sure there‚Äôs less stress, but I think what makes them happy is that they still have each other and a family. If anything, it‚Äôs making money that stresses and can make my dad depressed I feel. Anyway sorry that got off topic, and I do totally understand what you‚Äôre talking about but don‚Äôt feel bad about feeling bad for no reason (that‚Äôs like depression-ception lol) it‚Äôs part of being human, society sells up a lie that we are always meant to be happy.

People have already given excellent feedback regarding the importance names and hints at the larger story, etc. What I think it could benefit from is the use of some inner dialogue, though I'm not 100% certain.

Needs a bit more urgency as people have suggested though, the world feels too safe, no matter how beautiful the prose a story about fishing isn‚Äôt that interesting usually. But obviously the story isn‚Äôt about that, just add a couple more things to suggest conflict or a problem is on the horizon, that‚Äôs what keeps people reading, conflict and in fantasy, danger. You‚Äôve probably heard that before but it‚Äôs true, as far as I can tell. 

Sometimes the prose also becomes over written (not sure how else you‚Äôd call it). For instance: 
‚ÄúThe sun rose steadily, a warm ember radiating heat in the cloudless sky‚Äù sorry paraphrasing there, but you don‚Äôt need to necessarily say the sun radiates heat; you‚Äôve already called it an ember, and we know the suns hot.
