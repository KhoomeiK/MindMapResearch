When it’s a weeks long holiday, I plan in advance that I’m going to be eating garbage and I’m going to go out of ketosis and I’m going to get bloated and gain a bit of weight. That’s okay, because I know I’ll go back to keto when I get home. I consider the process part of the holiday tbh. Especially when I travel to Asia, or go camping, I find it too difficult to maintain keto.

I have these planned breaks, usually around my bday, and a few months over summer. This is how I’ve been able to stick to keto for over 5 years. Mostly recently, I knew I had Xmas, New Years, summer silly season (being Southern Hemisphere) and a 2 week trip to Thailand. I stuck to keto as much as possible around Xmas and that was fine. But I just went on the trip to Thailand and I basically lived on noodles and rice. When you are in villages in northern Thailand you don’t exactly have a choice.

I decided ‘fuck it’ and I will go back to keto when I’m home. I gained 7kg in what I think is mostly water weight, between December and now. I knew that would happen. I went back to keto when I got back from my holiday the other day and I’m just 2 days in and already dropped 2kg. It’s incredible how much carbs bloat me."

I don’t do keto in the way many people do, wherein they douse everything in cheese and try to make keto versions of normal foods. I eat pretty simply.

Breakfast is usually salami or bacon and eggs, maybe an omelette or low carb toast. My snacks are strawberries, eggs, cheese, almonds, dark chocolate, yoghurt etc. My work lunches are chicken and vegetables, with a rotation of sauces. And my dinners are meat or fish with vegetables...

I pretty much just minus junk food from my diet, which is my downfall normally. Biscuits and cakes are extremely addictive to me, and I rapidly gain weight and feel ill and tired all the time. I already had stopped eating pasta, rice and bread a year before, and I already didn’t drink soft drink (soda).

I’ve been eating this way for coming up to 6 years now and it’s been the only way I can lose and maintain my weight, as well as observe portion control and stop food cravings. It reversed my insulin resistance also.

I always have planned breaks and don’t go too hard on myself. I’d say I eat keto 9-10 months out of the year in total. I never eat keto on holiday or during Xmas time etc- I still love carbs, but they don’t love me."
