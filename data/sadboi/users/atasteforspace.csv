ExistentialSupport,fr5mtet,t1_fr5k31l,1589911158.0,"Thank you. It’s hard! And it’s always going to be hard! You’ll get used to it though. I’m 27 & things are constantly still evolving for me, but I’m becoming accustomed to it. The existential crises seem like a thing of the past. I am more nimble in my mind, I have learned how to truly connect and build lasting relationships, and I fully accept myself wherever I am. Everything is so easy when there’s nothing to fight. Just let it happen. Life will mould you into who you’re supposed to be. This has been an especially difficult journey for someone like me. I was severely abused as a child and inherited a reality that was very far from the truth. Growing is pain, it is acceptance of all of the things that you create in ignorance and unreality. If you’re in pain, there’s something to learn. Slow down. Pay attention.  The fact that you have deep awareness of truth beyond what others see is a good indicator that you’re gonna be fine. (: 

Good luck to you! ❤️"
ExistentialSupport,fr5174b,t1_fr4ysb2,1589900660.0,I hope this doesn’t come off as unsolicited advice and you can connect with it. Sometimes I miss the connection.
ExistentialSupport,fr50ajn,t1_fr4ysb2,1589900197.0,"Yeah, you got a lot goin on fam. Judgement only exists internally in the mind. When we judge ourselves we allow ourselves to be judged. No one can truly judge you, as they hold as little truth as you do. Shift your framing. As unreal as anything is, the possibilities to reality are endless. It is a choice. 

I’m somewhat of an off-brand existentialist; I believe all reality is internal and very real. My world morphs day in & day out based on my perspective, and I’ve lived long enough now that I can see how external reality responds to internal reality. 

When you’re different from everything and everyone around you, it’s hard not to feel out of place. However, if you value your differentness, you will see reality shift to support you. People will give you weird stares and some people’s reality will heavily not align with yours. You will attract and repel people. Allow it without allowing judgement. I am completely surrounded by people who love and support me and although most of my friends don’t understand the depth of my truth, they support it. I do my best to make it palpable, and in turn we have growing understanding together. I know the limits of their interest as well, so they are not driven away by me trying to force things on them that they don’t understand. I have other outlets to get my needs met. I respect my friends and what they want for themselves. Together, we all have something beautiful to offer. 

It’s all about focus. Love is the answer. Love is real and covers all. It makes things simple. Love takes the focus off yourself and only helps people grow, trust, and prosper. You’re not wrong for believing what you believe, but it is partial truth, you’re just a piece to the puzzle. You have something to offer everyone and love allows people to access that without much effort at all."
ExistentialSupport,fr3vz0a,t3_gm6ca4,1589867818.0,"You sound a lot like my friend. The thing is, you think people are trying to achieve greatness at the height of passion, and find that passion unreal and unmoving. What if the things that motivate that passion such as helping others and reaching the heights of influence for the sake of human benefit are the motivating factor? These are different realities. It’s best not to cast judgement and feel confident in yourself and your views. You only hold half of the truth at all times.

I am a passionate person. I want to reach the height of my greatness, not to be great but to accept that as hard as I’m willing to work that I will be able to reach as many people as I am able with my personal truth and benefit people in understanding. My vision knows no bounds, but I take life as it comes. If I wind up living in a box, then that’s how it is; but I believe there is a difference between ambition and expansion. The purpose is lost with ambition, and growth comes naturally through expansion. 

I would challenge your perception a little & expand the possibilities of alternate realities. This mindset is very isolating & easy to get stuck in. The greatest meaning is the meaninglessness. It all boils down to one thing; growth."

It resolved when I got out of an unhealthy relationship. My night terrors actually just stopped at the beginning of this year, I still have flashbacks a lot. The best advice I can give is to let yourself experience the flashbacks and try not to fight them. Self-acceptance has been so key for me & realizing that I am not weird or abnormal, and everything I do has some root that most people aren’t going to understand but that it’s totally normal. I have a tendency to seek out really understanding and compassionate people and surround myself with them & am always completely honest about my experience once they get to know me.

raisedbynarcissists,fps6ucr,t1_fppmajf,1588868445.0,"It’s very complicated. I definitely experience dissociation, but that happens before my emotions get overwhelming, I just never feel them in that case. Sometimes they flood after the dissociation breaks, sometimes they just come out of nowhere and are intrusive. I’m feeling better today & probably will be fine for a while. I just have to feel what I feel then move on. The episodes last as long as they last & i find acceptance during and in them and they get better with time it seems. I also experience less dissociation over time, I go weeks usually but sometimes months without symptoms. I think it just has to be deal with in time. It just sucks sometimes because it’s debilitating & can take its toll on my relationships, but the strong ones last & that’s all that matters."

dating,fpqn0lb,t3_geq4eo,1588826706.0,"Honestly, it’s probably trauma related. I have this problem a lot with men. You need to give her a lot of space & either let her come back to you and check up on you without any pressure. Good things feel bad and bad things feel good. Let her adjust to why feels right for her, help her talk about what may be happening. If she’s not healing properly, and aware of her own patterns you may be at a dead end. You may need to become a bit of a bad boy to get her attracted. Don’t chase her, this will turn her off completely. It’s just messed up. This is what trauma does to people. She has to be very conscious to handle herself."
CPTSD,fpqakfz,t1_fbbpap6,1588818560.0,"Very interesting idea. I have a very unique experience that I would like to contribute. I am a high functioning sufferer, but that doesn’t mean anything. It’s more like I leave the protective parts behind and only struggle with the anxiety. I used to have internal panic attacks at all times, but no one in my life knew & somehow I was able to develop very stable and loving relationships. I have always been honest about my past, i just can’t remember when I talk about it or to who. This leads to me not telling people about my internal experience and so they just experience me as a regular fully functioning person, which I am not and only appear to be. Haha. I can’t even get my therapist to believe that my identity shifts with my emotions. What the hell, like, I know what’s going on. Just because I hold it together extra well and keep a smile on my face when I’m around people most of the time - and have perfected this act, I am considered high functioning. I will say that I am a fast learner socially. I basically came out of complete isolation at 13 and started studying people. I was so afraid of them but I wanted to be a part of something. I pushed my fear to the back of my mind and acted against it and I learned. The mistakes were rough and there are always times my anxiety gets the better of me & I can’t think and people will wonder why I’m being so weird or think I’m very stupid. This gets better with experience and I throw myself into that. It’s very interesting that I chose this path and I wonder what about me gears me towards that... I think part of it had to do with influence from my sister who was 20 years older than me and lived a very adventurous life. We started becoming friends when I was about 15. I always wanted to be like her. At family gatherings now people tell me I remind them of her. It could also have something to do with genetics. It’s just interesting. When I experience shifts in identity, which is very difficult as an adult when you’re surrounded by fully developed peers that have no way of understanding you, I just say fuck it! It’s the name of the game! And I laugh it off. It’s not the same internally as a person who might just be having a bad moment, it’s a literal shift of identity. What’s the worst that’s going to happen? People who already don’t care about me will care about me even less and form an incorrect opinion? Fuck em. That attitude makes a huge difference, the shifts pass easier and happen less and less frequently, because through them I am able to experience what is myself and what is not. That’s just the way it is for me. It’s when I fight them that things start to fall apart in my mind. I start hurting very badly and terrible overwhelming emotions and intrusive memories are triggered and I collapse and have to self isolate. It helps me not go bat shit insane on everyone :) cheers! I don’t know how interesting or relevant that is to what you’re talking about. But I thought it might be worth reading. 

I study biochemistry and am going into neuroscience and I find the things that happen within our brains very interesting and want to make my own developments in the field. We’ll see where I land, I have some very big goals and this is a very long process for me! I’ll be almost 30 by the time I finish my undergrad! Is what it is. I got a late start and had a lot of living to do before being able to make these commitments."
CPTSD,fpq88a3,t1_fioktnk,1588817148.0,"Yep. I’ve become rather social though naturally through my life. I was removed from the worst trauma at 13 but the abuse continued intermittently into my 20’s - I just didn’t know how to set boundaries. Since 13 I’ve had a natural inclination towards people. I love them and I want to do my very best to help them. My goal is neuropsych research and science communications so I can learn more about healing and communicate it to the public and help people understand how to heal and how to help people heal. I am obviously extremely intelligent, I make mostly A’s in my courses in hard science. My friends know me as a peace keeper, I stand up for anyone and love to tech people how to stand up for themselves. I was rather quiet as a child, but I believe that was just created by the trauma and never being taught to connect. I am 27 now & I learn more about myself all the time, whatever that trauma tried to turn me into, I naturally am not. It is quite a process of finding myself & learning how to be a person but all my friends say I’m doing excellently! I still struggle with some pretty major cPTSD symptoms & a couple other comorbid disorders but I do my best and that seems to work. I have never taken medication, which is astonishing, I just assume everything will pass and it always does! Cheers to healing!

There’s nothing wrong. You’re alive and that’s all that matters. You haven’t lost your soul, it’s just buried right now. That’s going to take time to heal and that’s fine & normal. You’re just a person, and your unique circumstance doesn’t mean you’re alone. Give it time & take care of yourself the best you can. If you’re sad, that’s good! You’re feeling something! You can meet yourself there and know that it’s okay to be sad and you should take time to grieve your situation. Be very sad for as long as you need to, be kind to yourself.

I still have struggles that most people don’t understand, but I have a network of friends that I’ve built after a LONG time. It took me many years to figure it out, but I kept trying & it’s paying off. You have a unique struggle, one more difficult than most have to endure, but there are people out there who will accept you wholly and completely for who you are & who will show you love and compassion. I promise. It will take you a long time to figure it out, but it will happen if you keep trying. 17 is very young. I wanted to kill myself too. I spent years purely isolated & didn’t see an escape but I had hope. It’s okay to have hope, even if you can’t see the end. Please be kind to yourself. The people who will love you, already do & they’re just waiting for you to enter their life. Do the best you can, even if you can’t see that it’s good enough, people know the difference between trying and not and your individual struggle and the effort you must put in to survive will impact other around you positively, even if you cannot see it in the meantime.

Honestly, I think simple relationships can work when you’re getting both areas of your needs met however you need to, meaning you have other relationships that can fulfill you in those areas as long as there is love between the partners. Love means finding joy in their interests because it brings them joy. You don’t sound like an asshole, you sound like someone who’s intellectual needs are going unmet. I do feel sorry for your girlfriend though. This doesn’t sound like love. Let her go so she can find someone who encourages her happiness and shares her joy, not necessarily because the same things bring them joy, but because they find joy in her joy. Maybe you should lighten up a little. You’re missing the importance for the smaller things. Big things like politics, economics and finances are important too, but not everyone has the capacity to understand. There are truths to life to be found in nature and maybe you could stand to dig a little deeper into WHY your girlfriend finds these things beautiful. She may have something to offer within what she sees beyond what you’re willing to tap into. The beauty of life is no shallow or simple thing. She may also have just been really excited to be with you in that moment which intensified the beauty of everything around her & you crushed her in that moment.

socialskills,fmx0dzh,t3_fxoc97,1586456224.0,"I’ve had to work very hard to develop my social skills. I was raised in near isolation till I was 13, then got introduced to the world. I have a lot of friends & people love and like me. That being said,  I’m weird. Hahaha. I embrace it at this point. I’m 27. I have a different view of the world & people support it. It took a long time to trust that. I’ve done so many things that were weird and socially mortifying. Haha. I choose to look at it like an experiment. In everything I do I’m learning. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had times where I was depressed for years & have been a full fledged adult making some bad decisions. It’s okay. I can finally see my progress. I never quit trying & I’m here now & that’s all that matters. It probably helps that I’m naturally adventurous and really want the best for the people around me in my heart. That helps. I put myself in situations for years that we’re uncomfortable in order to challenge myself. Waiting tables, sales, huge crowds, mingling in large groups. It’s been very painful, but when I tell my friends how it’s been for me on the inside, they say they never knew. People don’t care. It’s a good thing. All they’re paying attention to is if you’re there. People want to see you do well & when you’re having internal conflict, they’re just going to let you work through it. You have to know how to find the people that are going to love you. You have to know what you stand for and what you want. When you’re attracted to someone just go for it. Be weird. People love that when it’s genuine and will be open to the connection. You have to connect with yourself. You have to let people see your heart, just make sure it’s safe. There are people who will help take care of you & you will feel yourself being more open with them. 

I’ll be real though. I surrounded myself with the wrong people for years, but it was solely based on how I viewed myself. I didn’t view myself as worthy of talking to people that I had deemed “better than me”. Breaking down those walls had been hard but I’m the kind of person who sees a wall & wants to tear it down. Not all people are like that & that’s okay. It’s all about what you want for yourself & want to see in yourself. I’ve been through some really hard things & have always felt dignified in my pain. Like, I know what it’s like to survive, so when people act like they’re better than me I naturally amp up my respect for myself. Haha like, “who are you?”. Growing into that, I realize that no one is better than anyone else. We all have unique gifts to offer the world. People like the way I think & what I have to say about things. Everybody is weird! It’s not always the best time, but when it is you enjoy it. The best times just happen & you can have a good time whenever. It’s about how you view it. 

This self-love thing really hit me out of nowhere after working for it for 27 years. The pay off is huge. It’s weird because I’m in the same body with the same friends doing the same things, but my connections are deeper, I listen better, I am not concerned with what people think, I am only concerned with myself & the people that I care about. People can see the difference. I’m present. It’s literally mind blowing. Keep trying. ❤️"

""Twisted pearls that shine to shackled souls collide"" is wonderful

You're working with some real talent here. Overall, I think the whole thing could be a little more cohesive as far as what you're trying to portray. A little more solid in emotion if that makes sense? A clearer path to the end of the poem. I think this is very good, albeit slightly confusing."

I feel bad for my own mother with her many issues. I was angry at her for a long time. I only recently started thinking like this about her and it makes things much easier. Unfortunately space is key. Try to enjoy your time away from her as much as you can. That is your time for freedom, to be on your own. Ignore those kids at school. They're ignorant of themselves too, but they have their own struggles. Some of them act the way they do because they are sad inside, some are ignorant of things they have yet to learn. Have compassion and train your eyes to see the reasons behind why people act the way they do. I want you to pay attention.

I think the tone is solid all the way through, and I appreciate that for as long as it is, that's difficult to achieve and shows a lot of strength in your writing.  I don't mean to be harsh, but I would say it's a little cliche and flashy. I just wish there were a little more to it, like a pang of something else a little deeper, you know? But that might take away the solidity of it?  Overall, I like it a lot, the imagery is excellent, I just want to feel it more."
lonely,f2q13yd,t3_de0blk,1570353903.0,"I also want to say that the pain you’re experiencing is very real. But it is okay. Your emotions are running your mind right now. And that is okay. Just wait. Be patient and wait. Feel everything that you feel, and scream into a pillow or cry for hours. Wrote it out. You’re doing a good thing now by reaching out to connect with people about this. 

Imagine if you found a little puppy by the side of the road, and it was starving and had never been pet and it was just sitting there cold and helpless and afraid of you. How would you want that puppy to feel, what would you do for that puppy? You would probably pick him up, tell him it’s okay, and everything will be okay, take him home, warm him up, and give him some food. 

Now imagine you’re that puppy. Now you can feel about yourself how you feel for the puppy. The warmth comes from inside yourself. It’s like giving yourself a hug. Whatever you would say to someone in your situation thy you care about, say it to yourself.

People who care about you are out there. Everyone is just a little messed up & most of them are a lot messed up & run around like robots. It’s not you honey, it’s the world. But there’s a lot of beauty out there you have yet to see, and there’s beauty in the pain eventually too. You’re going to make it and all this will eventually feel a lifetime away. I know it’s overwhelming and feels like it will never end right now, but I promise if you hang on it will smooth out. Acceptance is key, there’s nothing that’s going to change immediately, but everything always changes. There are some beautiful things waiting for you. There’s nothing wrong with you. Sometimes people are just more sensitive to the pain the world so blindly ignores. It’s a very rough experience. It seems like everyone is happy but you, but some are just ignorant, or they’re taught how to cover it up. But you have a lot to offer to the world being born so sensitive to pain. You see things others can’t. You can learn to help people with that strength. I believe you can learn to turn all you weaknesses into strengths. You can help people like you. It’s a lot to take in. You won’t have a normal experience. But you are valuable to the world in ways you don’t quite see yet."
lonely,f2px1ki,t3_de0blk,1570351923.0,"Definitely don’t end it. I started contemplating suicide when I was nine. I fantasized about it all through my teens. I wouldn’t ever really say I was high risk, but there have been a lot of times I wouldn’t have minded dying. Anyway I’m almost 30 now. I have many beautiful friends, I have a purpose, I have social skills, I have my own place, and people are interested in me now because I have my own interests. My sister used to tell me this story (a little background: my big sister is the only person I’ve ever met like me. We weren’t raised together & were 20 years apart, so she had always been in my situation before.) but the story goes like this: there once was a little rabbit and all he wanted to do was be friends with the other bunnies. They would laugh and play but never wanted anything to do with him. One day the rabbit got so tired of trying to fit in he went off and started playing by himself. Soon the other bunnies saw him having fun and came over to see what he was doing and all the bunnies wanted to be his friend. When you stop caring, good things happen. You may have to wait, but be patient. I have struggled with chronic depression my whole life, I was raised in isolation and had no social skills, I was very afraid of people and still sometimes am. The trick is to develop your own interests, whatever they may be. You need to try things and try to learn. Never stop trying to learn. Push yourself to the boundaries of your comfort zones. Look at the way people around you view things. Nothing is very personal, so don’t beat yourself up, and when you get tired, rest. Rest as long as you need to and do what you need to do. It’s all going to work out, just keep your eyes open and feel what you need to feel and move forward. It’s okay to be hurt and it’s okay to take a long time to heal. Being a good person is the only thing that matters, and if you weren’t today, you can try again tomorrow. There are people out there you haven’t even met yet, and there always will be. You can always try again. You haven’t even had a chance to know who you are! Everyone is awkward, everyone is weird, you’ll figure it out if you just keep trying, I promise. Also, therapy helps if your parents can help you with that. Don’t get stuck on medication though. You can strengthen your brain alone and form your own thoughts and conclusions as you learn. I have had years in years of bleak depression, felt everything and felt nothing. Some of us need the extremes to find the balance and some people are just born with it. It’s not a bad thing, you’ll learn how to control your emotions and learn how to use them as a strength as you grow. If you want you can dm me and I can help talk you through it, and share a little more about how I have overcome this stuff. <3"

BorderlinePDisorder,ey69exa,t1_ey5y8bu,1566850413.0,"I’m not saying you meant to but if someone said this to me it would feel totally generic and I wouldn’t feel heard at all. There’s literally a million things running around online on how to approach someone with these sorts of issues, and everything you said is on the list of don’ts. I’m not trying to tear you down or anything, just don’t want OP to read that and get pushed farther into a depressive state because that’s exactly what comments like this do. I mean, it may be heartfelt for you but it doesn’t acknowledge anything about what OP said is truly happening in their life. It comes from a place of care, but a lack of knowledge & I just want to make sure OP is alright. I’m not trying to attack you, and I’m not trying to be rude, I’m just saying that your post is invalidating, because it is. Whether you choose to accept that or not is your business. I personally believe everyone needs to work on their validation skills including myself. But when someone is talking about suicide, it’s not really about you. I’m just trying to help the OP out & if I read that I would feel even more hopeless. It’s not personal, it’s quite the opposite. Sorry if I came off cross, I definitely did find it frustrating when I read it. I should have approached it better & taken the time to not knock you down, it honestly wasn’t my intention & my emotions got the better of me. That being said, my opinion still stands. 

Why you letting me bug you anyway? I’m just a nobody on the internet. I truly do apologize for my rashness though and upsetting you. This is not sarcasm. I’m a nice human."
BorderlinePDisorder,ey568p6,t1_ey4wtz7,1566823117.0,"This is so invalidating it’s not even funny...
OP, don’t let people like this get to your head. “Cheer up, it will get better.”, just doesn’t work and doesn’t make anyone feel better.

Gonna give you some hard honest truth. Right now I’m going through a bit of a depressive episode myself. Try not to contemplate suicide, try to train your brain to think about other things. Force yourself to think happy thoughts even if it makes you want to vomit. Suicide is not the way to go. Accept being alone. Find peace in that. I mean it’s almost the same as not existing! Conserve your energy for now, you don’t have it for other people and that’s okay. You need time to learn a new way to think. Read some statistics on superficial friendships & you’ll realize how not alone you are. There are people who will want to be in your life, but if you don’t have the energy to take care of yourself properly, they aren’t going to want to be there. Maybe your old friends suck anyway. I’ve felt very alone for the last 3 years, I recently made some new friends who accept my struggles & help me feel better faster because when we talk I can open up, get it out, get feedback I trust and move on. Try a support group. Make a little list of basic care for yourself everyday & celebrate yo titties off when you do even one of those things because you deserve it."

Advice,erf67xa,t3_c1mh2g,1560800967.0,"I think it’s important to pay attention to what’s going on around you as well. Sometimes it can seem like you’re the only one struggling with managing everything, you see the person next to you doing more seemingly effortlessly because of their grades and whatever judgements you make at a distance, but if you talk to those people they are experiencing the same feelings as yourself. As long as you can maintain it longer than you have before, you’re better for it. It doesn’t matter if you collapse into a puddle on the floor for a month or whatever lol, just acknowledge your mistake and move on. I do this same thing. This semester I did really well. I was working 15hrs & taking 15 and commuting 2.5 hours a day m-f with a 6 hour Saturday class. I got tired and I didn’t finish as strong as I should have but I did alright. I fell behind at the very end. Could have done better & will try again in the future. 

In order to maintain my mental strength during the majority of the semester I would give myself breaks when I needed: take the nap, go outside, make time for people. When it was time to study, it was time to grind. Sit down for like 3-8 hours at a time in order to be able to have that time to spend having somewhat of a life. But you have to make those sacrifices before you get the reward, once you’re behind you have to accept the consequences and do your best."

OCPoetry,epcmsoc,t3_bubrs6,1559156011.0,"This is amazing. I literally can't breathe. I love how the whole thing wraps around paper, especially the way it is reintroduced in the end, it's just a shock of emotion that forces you to create your own personal version of everything on fire. I think the word newspaper stands out because it brings the poem back to paper halfway through, but it catches my attention so much that almost disrupts the flow. 

I read it again and I think it's because nothing else is as descriptive. Everything just kind of flows from one thing to the next in this mental image. but the word newspaper is harsh and not foggy enough around the edges. I think you could use that line to come up with something to make someone think, only because you have done it so well through the entire rest of the poem. I would love to read more of what you write!"
