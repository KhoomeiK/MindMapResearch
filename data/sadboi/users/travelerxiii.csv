Have you considered an online platform? My fiancee has used BetterHelp for some time, and I recently started.  You get a private ""chat room"" that you can dump questions, thoughts, and daily events into and your assigned therapist will respond (mine generally does so on a daily basis) and you have weekly phone sessions. As I understand it, most of the therapists on the platform offer those weekly meetings in and out of ""regular business hours"".

I'm still early on but I like it a lot because I had the same issues you did fitting in another obligation during the work week. Maybe it can help you too. If you are interested, I can give you a referral link that gives you a free week to try it out. Just DM me or respond here.

Whatever you decide, best of luck to you. Take care.

OCD,ewnhdsa,t3_cotluc,1565578273.0,"I wrote this in a thread about a year ago and it seemed to resonate with some folks dealing with something similar. I hope it helps.

*It is OK to feel badly about things from the past. In many cases, you probably should to some extent and though the topics differ, everyone has something that makes them cringe in their backstory. Everybody. Those feelings and your recognition that you don't wouldn't do those things today are signs of growth - they are positive. But you can't just sit in that feeling all day.

Something that has helped me has been to create a (short) plan and then refuse to dive more deeply into compulsions. For example, I have a thought that I did or might have done something I am opposed to in the past. I might say ""okay, if it comes up that is an actual issue I will genuinely apologize and accept any impact it has. Until then, I have to assume this is my OCD and acknowledge there is nothing for me to do right now."" That's it. I mean what I've said, but unless there's a real world action I can take in the moment to address the matter, I recognize it as what it is (a diagnosed mental health problem) and go back to whatever I was doing or working on.

It isn't always easy, I fail at it a lot. You might find some help in discussing it with a therapist. I would bet that he or she will have heard it many times before.

Best of luck, and take care.*

OCD,ewngry1,t3_cp3c9n,1565577777.0,"Make yourself feel better? I don't know.

What I can say is that, in my experience, is best course of action is to accept that you're uncomfortable but there's nothing to do about it - you know you're dealing with OCD. Feel and think whatever you feel and think, then get on with your day.

Don't try to wish or will it away. Just acknowledge your feelings like a person sitting in the room of your mind. Eventually that person will leave the room. They might come back. That's okay.

patientgamers,eud3a31,t1_eucvh9j,1563698997.0,"I didn't know that about CD Projekt, though now that you point it out it makes perfect sense. In this case, Cyberpunk was simply a reference point since the first person in this thread referenced pirating it. Regardless of CDPR's origins, my original statement that without people actually purchasing games their large scale products of today, from them/their authorized resellers, do not exist seemingly stands. I don't believe they'd take money from GOG, create games like Cyberpunk, and choose to give them away entirely - if they did, I don't suspect they'd remain in business very long.

My question was derived from the fact that if one has access to the hardware to run software that demanding, the variable of wealth has been set in some respect. It was there enough to build or buy that computer. Hence my question about waiting for the price to reach a palatable level, so to support future development of the products you enjoy.

Maybe this is also based in bias, because I know personally many folks who very well can afford to make those purchases full price; let alone at 60% or more less than full price months later and instead elect to get it for free on launch. And those are the folks I think of when asking those questions. Economic status may drive some or even most of piracy (I'm sure there's a study somewhere that has an answer) but it definitely doesn't drive all of it.

Edit: not may, obviously does drive some level of piracy."

Play what you feel! Sometimes you scoop a couple extra games in a bundle or a buy one get one or whatever and they wind up on the shelf.

I just can't wrap my head around the idea that people feel like its OK to take the work of others for free when that's clearly not what they intended - particularly when it comes to things like entertainment media, which won't end your life if you can't consume it. If everyone held this mindset, games like Cyberpunk (i.e. massive budgets) simply wouldn't exist. Surely if you created something to make a living you would expect compensation from those using it.
