If she is not doing so already, I’d recommend she see a therapist or a psychiatrist soon if her mood does not improve. Keeping a promise not to tell is admirable, but keeping her safe is more important. She could try to take her own life again at some point. Please think about this. Even if she asked you not to, reaching out to others is not a bad thing if you want to keep her safe. I hope for the best for the both of you."
