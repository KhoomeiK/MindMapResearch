Adulting,fpvrp71,t3_gfkwl6,1588950609.0,"Do you have any hobbies? When you go on YouTube, what kind of content are you usually drawn to by instinct?

Music cover? Comedy? Photography? Make up tutorials? Languages? Travelling vlog? Product review or just reviews in general? There's gotta be something that your heart inclines towards.

Can you imagine yourself starting a YouTube channel doing any of that? I say this because there is genuinely a sense of accomplishment to build something from an idea until it becomes an end product, with you assuming all creative control.
You said all your life, you have been given a goal to work towards, now you shall be in charge of setting a goal. 

Honestly, you sound like you have a pretty successful academic achievement and career path. I'm sure many people like to hear about it or listen to any advice that you might give. There's like a bunch of YouTubers in big tech in Silicon Valley that like to share the journey of how they made it. Of course a lot of it are exaggerated to be more entertaining but you get the idea.

Just my 2 cents"

Although I dont like ALL of the K pop songs, I really feel that K pop performers deserve recognition and respects. They literally started since their teenage years and had to go through competition to get to where they are today. I was really anti Girls Generation when they debut but because of my interest in k pop, I sorta rediscover them and I couldn't help but respect each of the members."
