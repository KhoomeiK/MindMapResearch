relationship_advice,fq9amuq,t3_ghkgz2,1589191657.0,You said you don’t have feelings and  you’re only seeing him casually yet it’s not a hookup because you’ve met his friends and family? First I think you need to get your feelings for this man straight before you send anything. If you’re not already committed to him don’t bother sending anything. Don’t waste his time while he’s grieving he really doesn’t have time for you rn anyways. But if you see a future for your relationship together stay faithful to him despite the lack of contact and you could shoot him or one of his friends a message just stating you know he’s going through a lot and if there’s  Anything  you can do to help out. But just leave it open ended. Make sure they know you’re sending good vibes. If he wants to pick things up with you I’m sure he will in time. But he also might abandon the relationship all together. Going though something like this takes time and you never really heal from it.

But at the same time you both gotta be cleaning the litter box"
relationship_advice,fq841x2,t1_fq7s1jz,1589158070.0,It sounds like you’re not committed to this relationship anymore. It does sound like she has her personal issues that may be contributing to problems in the relationship. But still you can’t just run to your friends every time your relationship gets hard. As much as they know and love and support you if you are going to open yourself up to a parter it has to be communication on both parts which just sounds lacking (both sides). The way it’s been painted it just sounds you’re gonna have to pick between her and your friends. I don’t blame you for feeling manipulated it does seem she might have some of those tendencies but it also seems you might as well.running to your friends or purposely only bringing up negative aspects of your partner to other people in your life can be manipulative as well. Honestly this whole relationship sounds like a lost cause
relationship_advice,fq5x9df,t3_gh0uhs,1589119794.0,"Look hacking into your computer is a huge breach of trust. But honestly in my opinion you’ve been chipping away at her trust this whole time. 
You say she’s not from this country, does she have family around? Or friends she’s close with besides you? It sounds like you haven’t made much of an effort to make her feel comfortable in your life. Of course you want to hang out with your friends but it sounds to me like she doesn’t have a lot of other people in her life aside from you. Which contributes to the clingy-ness. 

And as far as your friends go, you have been fostering this bad relationship between your gf and friends for quite a while. Of course they will have a skewed view of her as you seem to only tell them when you have problems with Maria. In my opinion you don’t go broadcasting your relationship problems to your friends, family or colleagues! You talk them the heck out between the two of you. You have created the animosity you were trying to avoid. Look you have good friends that care but it seems to me they (as well as reddit) are not getting the whole picture here. 

You’ve said you’re taking your fair share of blame but honestly this looks a lot like your fault from here. You’ve painted Maria as controlling and manipulative to your friends when all she was trying to do was plan a trip for your birthday. HOW DO YOU NOT INFORM YOUR GF YOU BOTH HAVE PLANS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?!?!? Big plans it seems. We’re you not going to tell her? Did she not ask at ALL about your birthday before planning something? To me it sounds like she was just trying to be sweet but thanks to your selfish personality she ends up on the back burner. I think you need to take another step back and re evaluate from her perspective."

Truly op was insecure and if he’s feeling not good enough for her, that’s probably the truth. Since clearly reddit won’t look past a females sexual partners and sexual experiences. Maybe she WANTED someone more stable and reliable smart and that she could keep a conversation with. I’m sure she’ll find someone better because op you can’t run from your insecurities about size or your ability to perform. And I’m sure you’ve had at least a couple sexual encounters you might have regrets about as well. Not fair to judged her on her sexual past but it seems she’s probably better off without op anyways."

If you’re going to be involved in her life and your girlfriends life then you should expect to be under some scrutiny from them. The should be keeping a careful watch on you. You’re not the father, just someone they are letting into their life and family dynamic. If you’re invested in your girlfriend you should be willing to compromise. Her parents already said this is for emergencies ONLY. obviously if he’s at least half decent he would be calling the mother first about any emergency  to arise.

relationship_advice,foh5j6b,t1_foh42tj,1587760776.0,"I agree here sorry! But first you initiate the idea of threesomes but it seems only with the intention of having 2 girls. Then you go and hang out with the other male counterpart, bring him back home to your girlfriend, happy as a clam. All hanging out, either you’re looking for more than just a threesome (polyamory) or you kind of shot yourself in the foot here. You can’t have your cake and eat it too"
relationship_advice,fo63cre,t3_g5rxww,1587544965.0,"Sorry this happened but like you’re gonna wanna move on here. The relationship is over. She will probably never be satisfied with you. Doesn’t matter how hard you or her try. Humans are biologically evolved to mate with other humans with certain traits. Women are naturally more attracted to someone they feel protected by. Not saying every woman will feel you are less, but keep in mind. Not saying start a fight but don’t back down in front of your girl either. Be tactful or at least don’t coward out of a bathroom. That would stick with me. I know I wouldn’t be with my boyfriend if he didn’t make me feel safe every night. 
Also, for some reason it was really important to specify you didn’t cheat or abuse her, so good job for making the bare minimum I guess."
relationship_advice,fnzb31h,t3_g4d2kt,1587390416.0,"Most of these comments are great. Probably I would just talk to him, like a lot of people have said and see if you can figure a plan where if you want left overs he can cook something else for himself. But also tho you are on a tight budget if you can keep many meals protein based that will probably fill him up more. You mentioned you make like a box of pasta and he eats the whole thing. Pasta is just empty carbs so he probably is hungry after just that. Maybe you can both try re working some of the snack food and meals to make them as healthy and FILLING as possible. Make sure you’re including a beef/chicken/fish/pork in most every meal. Same with snacks, there are more or less filling ones. I love to buy peanuts or almonds because I eat like 15 still have more than 2/3 of the bag left and I’m stuffed. Or baby veggies. Instead of just chips and crackers. Sounds like you’ll figure it out tho"

relationship_advice,fnw1rde,t1_fnvnk7d,1587309663.0,"Honestly hun, as other posters have said we’re getting to the real problem. I’m not saying this relationship has to go one way or the other. Honestly it sounds you both have room to grow, now that can be together and it can be individually. But most importantly it should be personal growth. It sounds like you should really just throw yourself into your cooking, make what you like, get really good at it. Enjoy it for yourself, if he’s willing to grow too, he’ll come around and once he gets sick of pizza will probably be excited to join in. But regardless of him work on finding something you can better yourself and enjoy on your own. That will make you happier than any guy will"
relationship_advice,fnvnvv3,t1_fnt9by3,1587299854.0,"I don’t know if she was uncomfortable in the act or not. I only know what she said to him after the fact. and only what op has told us. I’m definitely not trying to minimize all of the women, myself included all of the daily sexual assault and rape that we endure. But I do believe we need to value ourselves, our feelings and the the truth.  And I would agree with you that the majority of men, when met with an uncomfortable/crying woman who had refused their advances would not have sex or would immediately stop. But communication is everything in sex. So all people should be actively working to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves. That’s all. But I also agree about your definition of what an actual false claim would look like thanks."
relationship_advice,fnvn2cj,t1_fnszvaw,1587299109.0,"Maybe, like I said in a reoccurring situation. But not the first time. You have to say no, you have to refuse, you have to make an attempt to show that this is not consensual. That reasoning really doesn’t work here because you if you’ve never been raped, and you are starting to feel uncomfortable like I said, you have to value yourself enough to say no. Stop. I don’t want this please leave. Obviously after that if they continue that would be considered rape. How can the other person know if you haven’t even told them to stop? I get she said she was crying, if she was again that’s different. Any normal person would stop having sex if she was crying. I think that’s a grey area as op hasn’t really said weather he knew she was crying when it was happening or is she just saying that after the fact, we don’t know. Either way, if she wanted it to stop she should’ve said something."
relationship_advice,fnsim6k,t1_fnril62,1587222389.0,"Why would you not say no at least once? Or make some concerted effort to get across that you do not want this to happen. Obviously if there is a weapon involved. Probably if it’s a reoccurring thing in an abusive relationship or such your probably mentally used to it. But if you’ve got a guy over, or your over his place, and you don’t know him very well but he hasn’t been violent, why would you just have sex if you didn’t want to. 

There’s a fine line but for me you have to value yourself enough to say uhhh get the f*** off me or to go along with it. I get being froze maybe in a situation where you’re not expecting it. But from the way op describes it sounds like they both maybe had thought about having sex before even meeting up and she might regret doing it. That does not constitute rape."
relationship_advice,fnshbom,t1_fnse94v,1587221619.0,"Obviously the post is short and vague. I don’t know op but what even half brained person has sex with someone who is clearly crying for one? As a female who had cried for unrelated reasons during sex every time has been met with an immediate stop and concern. Not every man is like this but I would say most people with half a brain and good intentions are. 
Possible he didn’t know she was crying. Especially if she didn’t tell him. To stop. Which is almost a requirement for rape if you ask me. At least once. Also possible that he noticed her crying and continued, finished and then for some reason they were just hanging out for a few hours until it is addressed? Seems unlikely. If it were me I would want out of that situation as fast as possible. 

As far as her trying to keep a relationship with him, I would as some other commenters say to lessen it as much as possible if you wish her out of your life, if you can get her to say she agreed during the act then afterwards was unsure In a screen shot I’m sure it will help your case op. 

@politeresearch I think you’re assuming the worst of op which is possible but I think you’re also filling in a lot of blanks you don’t know the answer either"

Some don’t realize and some probably have true personality disorders. I don’t know for sure but I think my ex knew when he was trying to manipulate me. About anything and everything. He turned me against my immediate family and friends. I was never allowed to go out on my own play sports in school (I was 16) and would gaslight the hell outta me when I questioned him. He used sex as leverage and would only touch me when he felt like i deserved it. Or he just wanted some pussy. He would go out without me and purposely make me look bad in front of his family just to embarrass me.
