You should get yourself calmed down, shut down your emotional side and restart the conversation with him. It's best not to get emotional because it seems like he isn't taking you very serious when you're crying.

It was pretty clear to me he desperately wanted a friend because we talked for at least 2 hours before usual business. He told me 5 years ago he met a guy (40ish) that he fell in love with hard. Strong enough that he told his wife he is gay and wants to be with this guy. They decide to split the house in half basically. So he had 5 years with the person he loved the most. But the guy he loved was unstable, depressed and drug addicted. His boyfriend killed himself but before he wrote the older guy a bunch of letters for keepsakes. Those letters just made him really sad, at least when I knew him. So it was pretty easy to see he was looking for something that I wasn't the right person for. Despite being a man whore for gay guys in my own life I exclusively fuck women. But at the time I was a hard heroin user living out of a motel. Oddly enough a gf of mine had killed herself half a year before I met this man. The only reason that matters is because we spent a lot of time crying our eyes out talking about how bad life is. But while I just kept getting closer to trying to kill myself he was developing strong feelings for me. I should have backed out first time I met him for his own sake but I desperately needed money and I truly thought he was a good person I didn't mind hanging out with him. But a dozen sessions later he's full on wanting me to move in and be a permanent boyfriend. As fucked up as I was I knew full well no matter what this guy is going to get his heart broken again dealing with me. He already was an emotional wreck and if I cut him out of my life he's going to feel even worse or I move in and essentially use him for a place to stay and eventually at the very least attempt to if not succeed at suicide.

There is always stuff I miss. And I read it as damfair for years before I finally took a closer look because that name made no sense to me.
opiates,flkdm8o,t1_flk33xn,1585238937.0,Exactly. It's just so dumb I can't comprehend it. Trying to piss off the person that can really make you regret it. It's a hard and stressful job dealing with people that lie to your face all day amongst other things. Intentionally trying to piss them off is stupid. And acting like all cops are uncomfortable around gays is hilariously optimistic
opiates,fljo0ko,t3_fp2ebe,1585220664.0,Dumb shit thing to do and I'd bet you don't do anything but stick your tail between your legs when a cop is tapping on your window.
opiates,fljntci,t1_flirjdm,1585220441.0,So is op.
unpopularopinion,fleeioj,t1_fleckyf,1585082854.0,Im with you on all that. I think it's pretty sick when a parent encourages and signs off on shit like that.
unpopularopinion,fle6kjp,t3_fo30o5,1585078544.0,Can I child consent to anything? It's difficult to know where to draw the line.
unpopularopinion,flchwa1,t3_fnu00t,1585031499.0,If schools are brainwashing kids into nationalism they are doing a terrible job. Now I think it's silly to have kids pledge allegiance as well. Kids don't even understand the words they are saying. You are anti American obviously and that's what you really are trying to say.
relationship_advice,fl9bp0w,t1_fl9av9b,1584948500.0,They can't stop themselves. It's really weird they want this to be true. If they didn't their first thoughts would be this is fake.
HumansBeingBros,fl9bge4,t3_fn69v5,1584948203.0,"Obviously your landlord can afford to do that and that's very nice. To everyone else that rents none of you are entitled to a free month of rent no matter what is going on. I don't want to sound mean I just want some people to understand that it's unreasonable to expect free rent. I've seen tons of people in Facebook that are expecting no rent and it's a really bad idea to think that will happen. Don't put your life in the hands of someone else. Get your rent together no matter what. I just came across that rent freeze petition and I was blown away by if. Those people are going to be much worse off if they truly are expecting no rent. Landlords have bills to pay, families and everything else. Just something to chew on. I hope you all get through this in good health."
WatchRedditDie,fkkbpnm,t1_fkk3h7q,1584279834.0,I've never visited that sub but I always heard it was everyone not hardcore left that gets banned.
AMA,fkge95e,t3_fi8iuz,1584157140.0,I keep seeing Asians on Reddit dating people are cracking jokes and avoiding them and I really have a hard time believing that. No adult in the world thinks Asians are the sole race to carry the virus. I live in Hawaii and just flew out of Honolulu which if you've ever been you know that airport is always packed with Chinese and other Asians. No one treats them any different. Tsa isn't fucking with them. Restaurants are letting them eat with everyone else. Next time you go in public turn on voice recording and record these mean people saying bad things. And if anyone truly is avoiding you it is most definitely not because you're Japanese. If I saw a lady with three kids I'd avoid you too. Kids are dirty.
relationship_advice,fk8xj7e,t1_fk8ho69,1583964739.0,"I can't disagree with that. Im my own unique situation knowing what I know now I choose to put it behind me to have a better relationship with my mom today. You're right though this
Ops mom seems unhinged. For as bad as my mom could get she never pushed me down the stairs. I wouldn't have let her anyhow."
relationship_advice,fk877wj,t3_fgvyzs,1583950658.0,Sounds like you already know what's best for you. Bring whipped is hard. I don't necessarily mean pussy whipped perhaps love whipped is a better way of saying it. You have to override you want to be loved to save you massive heart ache later.
relationship_advice,fk84lt6,t3_fgxqiw,1583949258.0,Hey man there's a decent amount of men and women who have parents like you. Most of us get over it eventually. That kind of stuff just doesn't seem to matter as you get older. My mom fell asleep on the couch when I was a kid and I woke her up when I crunched down on a cough drop in the kitchen. She reacted extremely violently. I just laugh about it amongst my siblings anymore. I hope it works out. Just remember soon you won't be living with her and not far past that you won't see your mom very often. Maybe just once a year. When you don't see your parents for so long it's just not worth it to cling into the hatred from years ago. As for right now good luck.
unpopularopinion,fk839d1,t3_fgx6z2,1583948534.0,"It's civil here because this sub is mostly racist, sexist, homophobic, islamaphobic, rapist neck beard boomers according to most other Reddit users and we all get along."
rant,fk395hy,t1_fk38nca,1583822504.0,Oh no!
rant,fk380vm,t1_fk37lqs,1583821171.0,No you are disgusting. Telling people fabricated stories to harvest sympathy. You are a fucking sick person. I bet amongst your peers you are known as the kid that lies about his life all the time. You lie because you are uninteresting. Everyone knows someone like you by the way. You're not fooling anyone except a handful of simple folk on Reddit.
rant,fk36scr,t3_fg0hzg,1583819800.0,100% this story is exaggerated at best. Every key point is blown out of proportion. None of this was racist. School thinks you're sick and questions why you came. That's normal during an outbreak. Simply keeping the sick from the healthy can save literal trillions of dollars across the world and save lives. And someone asks if your parents speak English. I bet my life it was said with respect and in a casual tone. Not in a bitchy manner as you suggest and that is a valid question. Are you so desperate you need to be a victim too? Jealous of blacks getting all the attention? Such a liar.
relationship_advice,fk24ec3,t3_fftnp5,1583792910.0,She's certainly thinking both of you are going to burn in hell for your sins. My advice say the Lord's prayer and a few hail Marys. Where there is sin there is forgiveness
AMA,fk1mb6o,t1_fk0f4qt,1583782542.0,"Yea I know what you mean. There are crazy Christian types in America that make up all kinds of crazy shit and constantly spread hatred in the name of God. In reality they have very little to do with Christianity. Im sure its much the same in the middle East. And a lot of crazy religious stuff happens because people interpret books like the Bible and the Koran and vastly different way that fits their preference. It is much more common however that Muslims interpret very violent things from the Koran. Meccan and medinan both mention jihad frequently but it seems to mean different things to different people. Over the last 50 years though it has been interpreted in an extremely violent way to many, many Muslims."
unpopularopinion,fk052m8,t1_fjyqtl7,1583742186.0,"""CLEAN dreads are not for lazy people."" Very true, too bad it's lazy people that seem to like to wear that hairstyle most. I do live in Hawaii though which is the number one destination for lazy people. Tons of the hippies rocking dreads around here."
