dogs,fotic9p,t3_g9heup,1588054818.0,"In think in both the us and canada, gsd are typically used as police dogs as they are highly intelligent working dogs. Many k9s that are drug detection are labs etc, but the k9 used for apprehending criminals are gsd because they are versatile, and have strong working breeds. Many are also bred from a select group of breeders with known familial lines. You can do scent work with your dog or search and rescue etc. Gsd are also highly loyal and intelligent. Specifically beligian malinois, which are very common. But they aren't pets. They are working dogs."
canada,fnyex4v,t3_g4fp22,1587361082.0,"I'm wondering to if he was dressed as an RCMP officer and had a similar vehicle if he went door to door and just knocked on the door- many people would trust a police officer and let them in. 
How horrible and disgusting. Such an incomprehensible thing to occur. When people aren't stressed out enough as it is."

politics,fmo0u9v,t1_fmnjn8a,1586241343.0,How can you possibly say well done America when they are a third world country that literally stripped funding from hospitals. Trump was warned about this pandemic coming  for months and chose not to act. So many deaths could have been prevented. It's an embarrasment.
britishcolumbia,fmnv7d8,t3_fwa6mh,1586236235.0,Does the bylaw state dogs must be off leash? I for one have been taking my dogs to a field to run because the dog parks are closed and they need to be off leash. If they aren't causing trouble what is the big deal?
VictoriaBC,fme06lm,t1_fmdvll0,1585984066.0,Are the majority of these deaths from care homes?
britishcolumbia,fm13qul,t1_flzzpty,1585671447.0,It's a pandemic. Cut people some slack. The entire Ministry of Education is trying to figure things out. I would imagine the school will contact sometime this week. I know my daughters teacher individually called her as well as the other 27 kids in her class. The Gov't said programs would be rolled out by mid April. Cook with your kids. Be outside with them. Read together. A lot of learning tskes place outside of the classroom
britishcolumbia,flzye4v,t1_fly670h,1585637744.0,Many districts went back to work today. It will take them a few days to get things sorted out. I would expect some direction from the school later the week or next week.

I still deal with it, but have learned to recognize it most of the time about 10 mins before and can prepare. Happened this evening on the highway and i had to use some calming strategies to make it to the bathroom at home."
ibs,flq3gaf,t3_fq8dnq,1585377618.0,I also have dogs. I feel that dogs understand in a way. My flare ups coinside with anxiety being high so i feel my dogs understand me. Try playing some canine enrichment games. There is a huge Facebook group where people post ideas. Go for a little sprint in front of your house and then back inside to play games. We play hide and seek with ours or sprint down the block in the dark in our pajamas. No one sees and if they do- screw em. Best of luck. I know this pain is not fun.

britishcolumbia,fli7lzp,t1_flfg26k,1585176876.0,They also have a ton of industry up there with workers being flown in and out for camp work. If a camp gets sick and the workers need to all go to the fsj hospital then it places a huge stress on their health system which is already very small. It's difficult to even see a doctor there on a regular basis

britishcolumbia,fkj647s,t3_fhtslj,1584237185.0,"It's not so much the worry about hundreds of kids getting sick. It's the stress that that many sick kids would put on the healthcare system. My kids school is 350 kids from k-5. They only get one week of spring break. If a ton of kids get sick, many parents are rightfully worried for them and will be looked after by grandparents etc who are most vulnerable. They safest thing would be to close schools for a few weeks rather than try to stop an issue that is out of control already."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fhzop88,t3_f5aq5f,1582005833.0,"As a teacher, this is so accurate. In my first year teaching I had 3 very disrespectful and violent students. I went home and cried almost every day. It almost made me leave teaching. It still is stressful but now I just walk out and leave it up to the administration to handle it. I didn't go to school to be abused."
VictoriaBC,fh9r87l,t3_f20sjc,1581387776.0,Victoria's real estate is ridiculously overpriced. The prices are creeping into the rest of the island. I feel bad for young people who are saving for years and years and pouring their life savings into a downpayment on overpriced houses. They will lose their shirts similar to those in Northern towns have or other industry towns.
