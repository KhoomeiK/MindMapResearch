As for the therapies, I had actually been in group therapy for an IOP for 2 months I think? And while it was really helping me out in a lot of ways, I did this on the night before my last day, so I dont even have that right now.  I do regular ECT which has helped always in the past, and I ended up skipping my appt for it last week because I was afraid of my doctor there seeing what I had done.  I am already in progress of getting a new individual therapist too, supposedly supposed to hear from them in the next day or 2.  Thanks a lot for your help!"

I had to euthanize my 14yr old dog in December. and I had him longer than the rest of my pets and my human son.  He was everything to me, and I still cry on a regular basis over the loss of him.  If anyone ever handled him the way your brother does yours, I would just let it rip.  I'm in group therapy stuff for Bipolar, but a large part of what they have me talk about is feelings about the loss of my dog.
