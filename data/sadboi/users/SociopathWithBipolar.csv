The problem with me and them are most of them have terrible effects or just don’t work. Of course I like mania but it isn’t really what I’m missing, I always made dumb decisions while manic. I miss feeling human, but come to think of it I’m not sure if I ever have. Many factors could play apart of my emotional bluntness seen that NDRI’s usually don’t cause it. I had previously spent 3 or so years in social isolation, with minimal stimuli, due to that I have many issues that cannot be fixed. These years I spent in isolation would have been crucial into making me who I am, they have, but it’s different because I had to rebuild myself. Before medication I lacked certain emotions that others have, so it’s hard to say why it’s happening."

AskReddit,fjiwvts,t1_fjidzpw,1583377611.0,"Your serotonin levels are fine. You have a release of oxytocin around her, to absorb and take in everything and turn it into social memories, which also makes your protective over her, and dislike people more than usual. This is the initial part of falling in love, oxytocin takes over sending signals all over the place, releasing dopamine, possibly norepinephrine if you want to boast or show off a little, if you are compulsive oxytocin is telling the serotonin to settle down a little bit to make you ease up even if you do feel anxious, also when your levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are high testosterone seems to be higher than usual making you more competitive trying to make yourself seem more fit to mate with. We are social creatures, we rely on neurons turning on and off to make these connections. 

I have two solutions to your problem, either make yourself irresistible by becoming alpha making the alpha of her life seem little in comparison. Love and mating is about genetics, and survival, we are built to make ourselves and the next generation survive.

Or you have to move on, better yourself along the way, and don’t make yourself seem better than others, laugh at yourself, be unfazed by peoples bullshit, have a destination and work nonstop to get there, then you will gain traction in your love life from there. Also don’t be afraid to make dark jokes, if crazy is your type. Make sexual jokes but not awkwardly. If you are being disrespected, demand respect and give them a few warnings, if not received just walk away and never return even if it’s your parents, you deserve respect. I could go on man, but what seems the reality of the situation is she is planning her future, and you possibly lack status, maybe a bit clingy, just ease up and focus on you."

Don’t constantly do things that make you feel good, don’t over do technology, limit instant gratification. Pick up hobbies, do things that reward you after hours or days. Socialize with people you like, avoid people you don’t. Eat healthy to avoid fatigue. Sleep well. Practice mindfulness, over time master it. Exercise often, endorphins promote happiness via increases in dopamine and serotonin both. Control impulse by increasing serotonin levels in the brain. Decrease emotional bluntness by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine. 

Basically don’t cut out all instant gratification because it is important too, but don’t over do it. Use long term replacement methods for cutting abscess amounts of instant gratification out of your week. Be around people you like, it promotes oxytocin, avoid people you dislike because oxytocin makes you remember them and messages a part of the brain telling you to stress. Eat healthy it promotes mental, physical health and sleep. Sleep good because it allows neurons to send the correct signals because there is fewer mishaps amongst neurotransmitters. Mindfulness is known to be equally as effective as antidepressants and I vouch for it over SSRI’s but I don’t believe SSRI’s are obsolete, by mindfulness improves other areas of life as well on top of helping depressive symptoms. Exercise because it makes you feel good mentally. Control impulse because short term gratification addiction is a black hole."

I’m actually working on a book about happiness, which is informative on the neuro chemicals and how they rely on each other to create happiness. The chapter is called Happiness Connections. People think oh this kid is on SSRI’s he shouldn’t kill himself, which is so stupid. SSRI’s actually shouldn’t be used as a means of trying to cure someone who just tried to kill themselves especially since they will usually send those people on there way a few days if they pretend they are fine. I have known many people who have killed themselves after they left a mental hospital. We also have this issue in the world on how people don’t share brain research with each other unless it’s IMPORTANT, let me say one of the worlds hardest questions was solved by using everyone else’s failed research, the man himself said he shouldn’t be rewarded and refused a million dollars to make the point I’m making."

So yes it was stupidity, stupidity is the reason I’m alive. Yes I wanted to die, it actually is a survival instinct, few know.

It’s a way to get rid of genes."
AMA,fjhl69j,t1_fjheq9d,1583350255.0,"That’s a good question! I actually cover this in the book. As happiness is very broad term. 

We have short term gratification which could be declared happiness to some, however nothing but constant short term gratification is a leading cause of depression from addiction, since you synthesize the dopamine process and end up over doing it, you disrupt other neurotransmitters causing depletion or disorder. So technically we could conclude happiness is short lived, but I don’t believe happiness is just this. We also can use long term gratification for rewards which to some people the words may just seem draining because it says long. To those who are unknowing of what the phrase means, it basically means putting off the reward, such as building a table for example. The problem with long term gratification is people eventually experience burn out from working all the time, but generally feel more accomplished and more rewarded, than those who choose short term over long term. Both of these people can feel “happy” but the questions I pose are are these people content with themselves and their lives, do they rely on constant distraction to stimulate their brain, do they know the reason they are doing what they are doing or are they mindless about it, how often do they get sad or tired of the day, do they often feel stressed, what makes them feel depressed or stressed or compulsive or even feel numb. Yes I know the answer and this is how I conclude what happiness means to me. Pleasure isn’t happiness, pleasure plays a role in happiness, this is oftentimes mistaken which thus causes discontentment and stress. Depletion of dopamine or norepinephrine, possibly both, while serotonin remains in a healthy spot causes emotional numbness, while compulsive behaviors is driven by high dopamine and norepinephrine while serotonin is down (this is why mania usually isn’t long lived). After we determine a few factors we can step back and reevaluate what it means to be happy. First we need to be at peace with our lives, second we cannot stress over things that aren’t worth it, third of all we have trillions of neurons decided where to connect based off how we perceive things causing all types of chemical imbalances all the time, sometimes causing issues that need to mended to. Happiness to me is good mental and physical health, happiness is balance, not over or under doing. 

A few things to practice if you want:
Mindfulness (some of these are included but I really want to emphasize)
Time management 
Exercise 
Not indulging in instant gratification activities all the time 
Eating well
Meditation
Make sure to laugh at yourself
Accept life’s disappointments

When you are manic you have this delusion that you are better than everyone else or that you are invincible.
