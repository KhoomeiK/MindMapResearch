summonerschool,fqdhr6k,t3_gia34f,1589289937.0,"The fact that you are aware of the problems you have and want to improve them is very noble and honourable. 

I've fallen into the toxicity trap a lot, so I hope i can help. (i call it a trap because once you go in, it's much harder to come out, but please don't lose hope <3 ) 

It takes a lot of mental practice to deny yourself the ability to flame others. Every time you say no to that impulsive voice in your head, you win a small battle in your mind. It's a hard habit to form, but it's incredibly edifying and strengthening to do so. 

Reward yourself for playing your best and not being toxic. 

Turn all chat and ally chat off completely and never give yourself permission to turn it back on, no matter how you feel. Most tactical things in the game can be communicated with pings. 

Giving yourself 5-10 seconds in fountain to breath deeply is also good. It's better to allow yourself the space to reset than letting your emotions snowball more and more. You're mental health and wellbeing is more important than any game.

Hope this helps"

It was pretty chill on the woman's ward when patients weren't struggling, a really nice sense of community and camaraderie. 

I would say the quality of care was good as there were some brilliant nursing staff, but there were also some weird, unkind staff who didn't treat people well (treating me like a child, being quite two-faced). 

My main problem wasn't with the ward itself but the home treatment team who admitted me. I was struggling with severe depression and one of their guys basically told me that hospital wasn't the right place for me and it would 'scar me for life'. So he pretty much shut down the idea of being an inpatient to get better, which led my to think there wasn't much help for me. I sadly  attempted suicide, at which point I had to go in as an inpatient or I would have been sectioned (admitted under the mental health act)."

I think given the reactions you have described, you should bring this to your therapist as they can help you work out the best way forward.

mentalhealth,ffp3iy7,t3_eueom6,1580085566.0,"I think you're suffering from intrusive thoughts. They are exactly as you describe; random ideas, images or impulses to do weird, dangerous things without any explanation. I suffer from this myself every day. It really sucks because I'll get hung up on a horrible image or idea and lose concentration of what i was doing. 

If you're feeling adreneline with them, then i would suggest looking up grounding exercises online. Grounding your senses; so like drinking a really cold drink, having a cold shower, smelling something strong like perfume or coffee. Basically, taking your mind out of the mess of thoughts and feelings and just focusing on something solid and real, the feeling of cold water, the weight of your feet on the ground, the sensation of breathing in and out slowly. 

It's a really hard thing, but in Mindfulness, I was taught that you need to develop a non-judgemental attitude to your thoughts. A thought comes, notice it , and then move on with your mind. But this is really really hard, and if the thought is something as horrible as 'stab yourself', 'run into the road', then i completely relate how stressful and painful it can be.

Stay strong. Remember that your brain can do some pretty annoying stuff without you wanting it to. It's not your fault. And you know in your mind that those thoughts are completly crazy and you wouldn't want to do those things. But I know how hard it is. You'll get through this."
