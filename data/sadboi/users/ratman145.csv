iphonehelp,f289c0z,t1_f28935f,1570055790.0,I have unlimited so it’s not a problem. I can’t use mobile data to update my iPhone and as far as I’m aware there’s no way to get iTunes on a chromebook so I can’t update it on that at all I don’t think

depression,etj87dr,t1_etj5vso,1562868130.0,"Thanks man, life is so crap like consistently for everyone, it’s weird how it’s always when you try and grab it by the balls it kicks something up to put you down, it always helps to have people with experiences I can relate to, I’ve never had much luck with girls that’s why when I finally find one who likes me it shakes me up a bit u know"
depression,etj0m9x,t1_etizeda,1562863819.0,"Thank you so much for this I’m going in the hopes I can come out the other end a better man. You’re right when you say I have to be okay to be there for someone, Im well aware being the state I am I’m not in any position to be dating anyone it’s going to be hard at the beginning I guess, but it’s just a means to an end. I’m honestly so glad I have this subreddit to turn to, there’s always one person who knows just the right thing to say so thanks again."
depression,ethsm22,t1_ethrftt,1562826149.0,"That’s a good way of putting it, most people I’ve met don’t say anything  but the ones who do are just being invasive I know I wouldn’t ask someone such a personal question if I didn’t know them"
depression,ethrk3c,t1_ethqy1h,1562825147.0,"Honestly back when I was a kid I thought it would be good to have scars just so people knew how messed up I was at a glance, now I’m an adult it makes things like getting a job and meeting new people so much more difficult even if people are nice and respectful I still know that they’re looking and coming to their own conclusions and it brings up my anxiety."

martialarts,et7e7fd,t1_et7dnss,1562529726.0,"XD Idk man I’ve just started training been looking for some videos to help me out, he’s got loads of ppl licking his asshole in the comments section one guy even compared him to Bruce lee, his gym is a couple of hours away from where I live too I didn’t think fake martial arts would literally hit that close to home"
depression,et5t2ap,t1_et5r1xb,1562488354.0,"a month ago I nearly caved in and tried it I thought the same thing for a long time but when I got to it I just couldn’t rightly go through with it, all of my life I’ve just wallowed in how sad I am and how futile trying is but after that night I’ve been trying my hardest, I made an account on here to try and find people who understand how I feel after years of counselling with people that could only guess how bad it’s been. And little posts like yours ensure I’ve never been alone in feeling like this and I never will be"
depression,et5sgi8,t1_et5ru3p,1562487425.0,"It’s odd thinking there might be some people out there that have never had thoughts like this or maybe everyone has had times when they do but they don’t talk about it. I always knew a lot of people had suicidal thoughts but I never knew until recently a lot of people are almost constantly suicidal even if they don’t want to act on it right then, it’s always there as a looming promise to themselves. No wonder depression’s such a slippery slope it keeps holding you down as long as it can by conditioning you to be sad even when you’re happy."
booksuggestions,et5q6wz,t1_et16tyq,1562484202.0,Ah thank you very much
depression,eswk36x,t1_esughf5,1562316210.0,"I was on a pretty heavy dose for years but I haven’t taken it for a while because of side affects plus I’ve been reading up on newer studies on mental health and I found a doctor called Chris Kresser who said “if you have a stone in your shoe you can take pain medication but it’s much more effective to take the stone out of your shoe even if it’s deep in there” it really resonated with me, I can understand how useful meds can be but they’ve never helped me much they just made me sweatier!"

Dogtraining,eskcqr7,t1_eskc1tg,1562059980.0,"That’s what I think, I’m not a trainer either. 
these people don’t even seem to know anything’s wrong with how they’re doing it either I really think if a dog has problems with obedience or behaviour it can be solved with training and proper care.
 I can’t imagine getting a dog and treating it like property rather than family, let alone yelling at an animal who doesn’t know what it’s doing wrong."
Songwriting,esk9noz,t1_esk7agp,1562056380.0,"Love it cheers very Matthew McConaughey :p, instantly it really clears up a lot of trouble I’ve been having with my voice break its like a bridge over that I feel like I have access to a whole new bunch of lower notes just by knowing I can break it up. I’m looking into it big time now I feel like that could help with emotional impact too."

Advice,eqyi6cq,t1_eqygol8,1560383700.0,"Are you actually mental how are there no good reasons to believe to believe he did anything wrong 6 people have all come forward and said in excruciating detail how he sexually abused them by molesting them and manipulating their young minds whether you believe them or not you can’t just ignore their claims; frankly I’m done replying to you I was more than willing to keep an open mind but you’re clearly completely biased and ignorant, Jesus Christ taking little kids into your bed isn’t something someone does when they’re just trying to simply entertain kids for their benefit, it’s more than unorthodox it’s sickening if you honestly believe that people should be taking random children into their bed whether they’re abusing them or not I think you should get some help."
Advice,eqy6f5h,t1_eqy57ry,1560378153.0,Besides “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence” it’s completely different from positive evidence that helps prove innocence if there’s no proof he’s guilty it doesn’t mean he’s automatically innocent
Advice,eqy57ry,t1_eqy0p4r,1560377682.0,"The legal system isn’t irrefutable, what about OJ Simpson he got away with murder it’s pretty much agreed world wide that he’s guilty. There’s also a huge problem putting such a beloved figure on trial when the jury could all be massively biased as well as pitting a normal family’s lawyers against a rich mans lawyers. I don’t pretend to know if he’s guilty or innocent but I’m not naive, the legal system can be corrupt and no matter how nice and wholesome people seem on the surface they can have dark hideous tendencies when there are no cameras about especially if they like to shut themselves in a room with a child at night. Like I said before he either only wanted to show certain boys a good time and let them sleep in his bed which is odd for a man who claims to love all children or he had a specific type of boy he wanted to sleep with which raises even more problems. :/ I get why you’re defending him I love his music and I want to believe he was completely innocent and just a very damaged person with a few issues, but if he was guilty he was universally loved which makes him a huge threat as a predator half the battle for these sick people is the grooming and he had the majority of the planet groomed already which makes it easier for his to get away with it."
Advice,eqxy4va,t1_eqxwkgu,1560375262.0,"Do you have any proof  that he was never inappropriate? Or is it just what you think after looking into it? I’m not trying to be rude but that’s a pretty bold claim, I think he was really damaged as a person and that made him very childlike but no one knows what happened behind closed doors. If he just wanted to show kids a good time why wouldn’t he invite little girls to sleep with him and why was it only conventionally cute little boys and no fat or ugly kids that he slept with?"
Advice,eqxjb9u,t3_bzvqbj,1560370157.0,On Skype or google voice you can’t call 911 but you can look up your local police stations number and call that and tell them there is an emergency but you don’t have a cell
