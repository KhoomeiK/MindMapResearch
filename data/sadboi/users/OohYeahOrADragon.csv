Clean the sections starting from highest part first then everything under that. One, dust falls. And a lot of residual cleaner spray does too.

politics,fn9nbqz,t1_fn9gykc,1586779215.0,"As an American, and I mean all the way back in my heritage, I feel so angry at my leaders sometimes. The everyday lay-person isn't so bad. But the more money and status seems to bring out such a selfish stubborn stupidity. 

And they tell me if I don't like it I can leave up North or south. But my people have been forced to move from their land too many times. The impoverished whites. The African slaves. The Muskogee natives. So I'm going NO where until America's sits down and act like an like it has some sense left."

Coronavirus,fn952p7,t3_g0d7cd,1586759696.0,So I'm not holding my breath over this one. The small business loans provision of the CARES act said it had money set aside for aid to small busines owners. And y'all can see how well THAT went.

An additional method to get that train rolling is to be aware of how you're an adult now. I know when I was younger, and undiagnosed, life *sucked*. I was so often miserable. My mean voice was on the inside and from the outside. 

I realized kids don't have much of a say on what happens in their life. Adults control what happens to them. 

Then I evolved into Legal Adult™. So I get 100% say of what happens in my life. And if I can help it, I choose not to live one more day in misery. When I hear mean-voice rev up, I recall *why am I letting any part of my lifetime be used on such ugly thinking? Thinking this other optimistic thought is much better*."
Coronavirus,fn76flo,t1_fn6ysbk,1586714203.0,"Waaaaay ahead of you dude. My bachelor's is in clinical psych and I love it. These suicidal intrusive thoughts are a combination of hereditary depression and a bit of normal brain functioning malicious compliance. 

Essentially, in an effort to help you survive, your brain always tries to predict the future (do it too much and that's anxiety). It tries to predict dangerous situations so that you'll avoid them. It's always doing that unconsciously. That's why when you're driving across a bridge you get a flash of *I could careen into this tree* or if you're waiting to cross the street you get an image of *step out in front of this bus*. It's your brain trying to solve problems not an indicator of mental illness. It's quite common. 

Now me, I'm still clinically depressed. So when I get overwhelmed, my brain decides to run future-prediction simulations to figure out ways to solve my problem. Then I get suicidal intrusive thoughts as one way to solve my problems. Now, it's the nuclear option to solving my issues but a possibility nonetheless. So for now I can only be aware and know that's not something to actually consider."
wafflehouse,fn6bmwm,t3_fwmusw,1586694611.0,I didn't even think about that part. FEMA uses waffle house to determine how serious the damage is in a community after an emergency. They said it's never been red until now.

Coronavirus,fn5pr2a,t1_fn5ogp2,1586671794.0,"Don't panic but be informed. You may not have been around anyone that's been confirmed infected because of the lack of tests. For now, please start wearing a mask (masks lower the risk of you spreading it if you have it). And call your doctor. For healthy people it's a coin toss of how severe symptoms will develop, if at all. Most recover fine but until you do you don't want to spread it. You should have an emergency plan kit in case severe symptoms hit because then they'll hit hard and fast. It should include living will, child care authorization, medication list, regular doctors etc"
Coronavirus,fn5oqnz,t1_fn5mpbm,1586670886.0,iirc there was an incident in Atlanta where 2 Black men were removed from a bus and arrested for wearing masks. The mayor then issued a memo to apd about relaxing on the law.
