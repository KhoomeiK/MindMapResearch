CPTSD,fqu23qb,t3_gksxiz,1589650535.0,"I do this too, mostly on fb. It feels horrible to get no positive response, I feel you. 
If it means anything, I think it took a lot of strength and courage to share this feeling, and I am proud of you!"
ptsd,fqu1dkv,t3_gkqsfs,1589650132.0,I am so proud of you! That is difficult for sure. It’s great to hear you’re feeling better and more at peace now!

Anxiety,fqu0yj5,t1_fqr1ajj,1589649900.0,"Yes! I especially relate to your last comment. I always thought I was okay being pretty frequently isolated as it was, but it’s obvious I need some type of social interaction. 
I also didn’t really consider that desire being more comfortable in quarantine, that I could still be neglecting myself. 
I really appreciate the response!"

I personally don’t know how I would handle this.
Like others said. It’s been 3 years, you’re probably the only who person who knows BUT, 
I would also get the concern of them having been still screwing around when you first met. 
Best of luck to you and your decision. I recommend therapy if you think it could help, he clearly could use some help. 
I’m sorry this is a situation you’re in. And clearly he’s fucked up over it and I can’t imagine being in those shoes."

Opening every gift and getting an egg is lazy, maybe higher chances but not 100%.
And guaranteed gifts? Requires you to do a whole lot less exercise and getting out because ope sounds 15 stops got all my friends covered all done.
Yes increasing percentage is one thing but dumbing down the game is just a little ridiculous

However a large gift inventory seems fair"
