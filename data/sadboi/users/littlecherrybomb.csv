zelda,ffwc0wd,t3_ev267s,1580294674.0,both are fun. I love transforming into different races with the masks in MM & I love traveling through time in OoT. to me there is no which is better. I love them for different reasons. however MM is less linear & I like to take a break from main plots in games sometimes so that’s refreshing. also MM Link being able to do cartwheel jumps? since when did he learn to do that lol amazing.
