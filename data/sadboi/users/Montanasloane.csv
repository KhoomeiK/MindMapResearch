cfs,fr39n7i,t1_fqo2wbx,1589852757.0,"Thanks fellow warriors for the advice and support. I fortunately did see another doctor today and she actually didn’t brush me off. She said it didn’t sound like  anxiety (which I’ve been misdiagnosed with multiple times) and she asked the magic question “do you feel tired after exercise?” YES. She took me seriously when I said “I need to lay down after vacuuming.” She took a lot of bloods, including glandular fever, Epstein Barr, ANA, ENA.. for those who have been through this, will those tests help with chronic fatigue diagnosis? 

I am very thankful to finally have a doctor who didn’t brush me off or declare me depressed. Of course we are depressed. Not being able to do even half of what you used to do is depressing!

I’ve had time off work due to the lockdown and I actually like my job or did until fatigue made it near-impossible to keep doing, but it’s been nice not to have the dread of “how am I going to get through this day”"
Anxiety,fqzdq9u,t3_gex7uu,1589765222.0,I get this. You’re right; it doesn’t feel like hyperventilation. I’m going to the doctor about it tomorrow because it’s affecting me on a daily basis. The scary part for me is it can make me feel sleepy as well. Do you get other symptoms with it?
work,fqz3ycs,t1_fqz2wa4,1589759484.0,"Thanks for the reminder that we just have to keep looking and stick it out until then. I try to remember that the worst day at work is still better than unemployment. We can dislike colleagues but as soon as we quit with nowhere else to go, they’ve won.

cfs,fqkoby6,t1_fqkcs7m,1589431927.0,"Thank you for the helpful suggestion. 
To update: the doctor was appalling. He obviously had no experience with it, I told him what I’m going through, was in tears and he said “OK, so what do you want me to do?” Fatigue is not medically significant. I know you feel terrible but it’s not the reason for people to stop working” I couldn’t believe it. I’ve been a mess all day after it. It’s bad enough having this horrible thing and it feels like fighting for my life every day, and living with the reality of not being able to do all that I once did, then to be made to feel like it’s no big deal. It’s just tiredness. Sorry for the trigger but I feel suicidal and so misunderstood. I feel like nobody could ever understand until they experienced this degree of tiredness for themselves. I don’t know where to go from here, I’ve completely lost hope in any medical professional caring."

I will be sure to mention that, thank you for the reminder"
cfs,fqgqso5,t1_fqgqlsh,1589354092.0,I’ve had fatigue for at least 2 years. It’s always been low level with periods of reprieve but a 38 hour work week is not possible for me anymore.

Fibromyalgia,fq8ezce,t3_ghddvm,1589164694.0,"Emotions / stress definitely exacerbates my symptoms. I assume they’re related. it’s also a chicken and egg thing, I don’t know whether I’m stressed because my body is hurting and I’m tired or if I’m tired and hurting because I’m stressed and unfortunately nobody can answer that. I’ve decided that our bodies are just sensitive to any stimulation of the nervous system. Controlling stress and changing my thinking patterns makes me feel in control of my physical symptoms even if it’s just an illusion. I’m sure any stressor can certainly cause flares. It has helped me to use the flare as a sign it’s time to practice more self-care. So rather than hate and dread the flare, I see it as an opportunity to slow down and be kind to myself."

limerence,ffb2u7k,t1_ff4u7kt,1579750377.0,"I can only offer advice based on my experience and with my last case of limerence with a co worker. It’s been almost 2 months now and I’m healing. Out of sight, out of mind is true. It will feel hard at first, like withdrawal, but then it lifts. Time heals all. Tell him if you really can’t live without ‘closure’ but better best forgotten. I wish you all the best whatever you choose to do :)"
limerence,fepgk1i,t1_fenkhz1,1579319945.0,"Yep... a lot of inner work, however messy, and uncomfortable is the breakthrough for this dis-ease of the mind"
limerence,feiq6jt,t1_fei9bjc,1579144460.0,"I think “what do I want from this?” is a good place to start. I can’t speak for you, but I know for myself, that the urge to disclose came from a belief that they like me back and are almost waiting for me to say something. When I have disclosed (once) that wasn’t the case. Yes it got it off my chest, but it made me awful because my ego (which I believe drives a big part of Limerence) mourned that big time. 

As for my recent experience with the co worker, to be honest I’m still mourning it. I’ve gone into a depression over it. Nothing energises me now to go to work or be at work. And because he used to be there, and I still see his name on client files and notes and things in the computer, I’ve been having anxiety and sadness. The funny thing is I wanted him to leave because I wanted to focus again at work with no distractions. Classic case of careful what you wish for. 

Are you able to stay in contact with this guy outside work?"
limerence,fei45mq,t3_ep6lsp,1579129881.0,"32 here. Same boat. I’ve not even had an actual relationship. I’ve realised that I couldn’t notice if anyone available was genuinely interested in me, because I was too busy being hyper-focused on people who were flirtatious but unavailable or simply aren’t interested, but my ego wouldn’t let go and kept on hoping/ interpreting platonic signs as interest. 

It sucks. And yes it makes me ill too. My last LO dropped off the face of the earth a month ago, because he was just a co worker who left the company, and he left my social media requests unanswered and seeing him was my “high” so now I’m in an extreme low. I hate how much this affects our energy levels. Extreme high or extreme low, no in between. 

I won’t even log into Facebook at the moment because it would make me even more low to see he (probably) still hasn’t accepted me and I’m still pending. So I haven’t seen my friends updates or anything in the past three weeks because I can’t face it. I feel like any normal person would say oh well and move on. 

As he was my co worker, I have been forced to take two weeks off work because I was having anxiety there. So now he’s costing me money as well. It’s ridiculous. But a reminder that what we experience is far beyond a crush.

Limerence is horrible. It’s like we KNOW one person is not that special, because we can so easily become limerent over someone else, but the depression sets in anyway. 

Big hug ❤️"
limerence,feg5nz3,t3_envdyz,1579078087.0,"My recent LO was a colleague who also just left the company so I empathise. 

I agree with no harm in speaking your truth. But I think the danger is in limerence causes us to exaggerate our importance in that person’s mind. It’s always possible that they just don’t care that much or wouldn’t even say we are close to them. 

So as long as we deal with our expectations - as in making them null and void - we are only coming from a position of wanting closure for ourselves then allowing them (and ourselves) to move on. 

All the best."
limerence,feg4foj,t3_eoxx1n,1579076452.0,"Yeah 100%. Sure, someone would say limerence is not trauma. But the constant elevating of somebody at the cost of diminishing one’s own self worth is a traumatic experience. 

The mind/ body doesn’t differentiate between different types of trauma. It doesn’t categorise it the way people would, when they say “people have gone through worse than that.” My body/mind doesn’t know “worse than that.”  Funny, “hey you weren’t in the war” never turned off the stress response. Because no matter what the horrible ordeal is, the body’s reaction is the same. So I never let people invalidate my experience. YES it’s traumatic. It’s an awful place to be and we all know it."

I just got a doctors note and took two weeks off. It’s my sincere hope I can get another job. 

One of my coworkers who I vented to one late night shift went and told my boss... makes me feel very done with this place. You think co workers would be supportive but apparently he loves his job and told my boss that he was “offended” that I didn’t. Ugh."
Anxiety,fe5itub,t3_enuvi1,1578870018.0,"Yes! It’s the small steps done consistently that lead to big changes. Well done! 👏🏼
It may not seem like much but it really is; because anxiety is so much about memories and when we have memories of being panicked and feeling incapable of just going to the grocery store, it will prevent us from trying. But when you’ve done it, you now have the memory of succeeding. And you will again. It’s all about repetition and celebrating the ‘small’ victories."

And what hope is there when the old people who are meant to be pulling the young people up, are commenting on their Instagram photos and trying to recapture their youth through them? Yep it sucks.

Honestly it’s like nobody wants to be bothered with anything and I haven’t got the ability to deal with every problem that comes through. I’ve never worked where so many people were terribly unhappy. But I get it. I can’t even relax when I’m not at work anymore. I took a holiday and all I could do was stress about having to go back to work.

But I know that even though the others slack off and the boss doesn’t care, when I do it will be noticed. I’m not that lucky. I know I need to get out of there. It’s not going to get any better. I had a major anxiety attack just in time for lunch the other day which meant I couldn’t even enjoy my downtime before I was back on the phone. Not worth it. All this job gives me anymore is money.

limerence,fbhvbro,t3_edhgwa,1576883278.0,"The advice someone gave me once was to imagine them doing something gross and unbecoming. Seemed to work when I was desperately obsessed. 

It’s just a thought. Your brain is tricking you. That’s why it’s called fantasy. The reality is she is flawed and imperfect and would disappoint you and let you down and there are parts of her that aren’t flattering. 

I would recommend not going to her gym , you are only feeding your obsession and giving into stalker tendencies is not good. It’s not going to diminish , the limerent brain cannot be trusted to be rational. We see these people in hyper-attractive light and the way to heal is to remove the images from your brain. Seeing her won’t help at all. It’s not closure; it’s just your brain addicted to the limerence, fooling you into thinking this is going to be a good thing. It won’t be. Contact is a drug it must be starved of. 

I stalked an old LO at his gym, the coffee shop outside his gym actually with the fantasy he will come out and have coffee with me. The reality was he gave me a WTF face, and went on to his car, and I realised this guy is NOT in my life nor am I in his. I realised my own arrogance in thinking he’s just got time to sit there with me that particular day anyway. I don’t know his plans, I’m not privy to them because I am not in his circle. It was a harsh realisation that REAL friends plan to do things, they meet up, whereas stalkers just show up in the hope of connecting with that person which would be nothing more than a forced interaction anyway. This person does not have any plans with you. Put the shoe on the other foot and think how you would feel if someone you didn’t care for was around a lot. Then don’t do it to someone else. I had to remind myself of that harsh truth. 

We are irrelevant to these people no matter how much our fantasies tell us otherwise. Rather than go to work that day and get on with my life, I drove around crying for 4 hours, shaking. Limerence is a cruel bitch, don’t elevate people who don’t give you a second thought. Honestly. Stalking someone (and yes, it *is* stalking) will only make you feel worthless and will never produce the reaction you want from the LO anyway. Ever. 

All the best. You will overcome this."

limerence,faw4fjq,t3_eaqsp8,1576365802.0,"Sounds familiar. It kinda helps to remind yourself that it’s all chemical. It goes a long way in helping you to stop blaming yourself. If this conversation was between you and anybody else, you wouldn’t interpret it the same way. It would just make sense that someone can’t remember and leave it at that. It wouldn’t consume you all day. You asked him a question, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to talk, there’s no opening there to begin some totally unrelated conversation. Us limerents look for any excuse to talk to LO and imagine they will be totally engrossed immediately. We can’t just say “hi” like normal conversation begins. 
I totally relate to thinking they don’t want to talk. One of my past LO’s injured himself and was in a neck brace and texted with me for 20 minutes before saying “hey thanks for the chat. Sorry but I can’t keep texting it hurts my neck to look down.” And my stupid selfish limerent brain at the time went if he liked me if he cared blah blah blah he would have put up with the neck pain, he never would have ended the conversation, I hate him.  And I didn’t talk to him for a week. Gave him very obvious immature silent treatment. Ha, crazy.  So yes I relate."

I feel depressed and especially rejected after the FB stuff. Everyone accepts everyone on there so it feels even worse. It’s hard to have had some person be kind every day and to know now that it was probably insincere. That hurts a lot. He was so nice that I feel like I could never trust anyone to be honest about their real feelings about me ever again. I’m really torn up about the fb thing, and moreso because it feels stupid to be so upset about it. The thing is I don’t even actually know if he ignored, declined or accepted. I have been too scared to even look. I’m just going by that he’s not shown up on FB messenger. But I can’t even bring myself to log in to Facebook and it’s making me feel sick that he has that much power over me because it’s possible he did accept, but also I know I would be gutted once it’s confirmed he didn’t.

I’m older than you and I have been in your shoes. What’s missing is your own self confidence. Nobody can give you that or take it away. You get that confidence by recognising your own strengths and accomplishments and honesty not giving a f*** if others don’t see them or know them. When you are confident and happy within yourself, people know you don’t need their approval so they know they don’t have any power at all, over you. Yes you’re more than your looks and it’s not your job to make people see that. You just have to be confident of all the good qualities you have and stop worrying about people who only look at the outside and make judgments based on that. Because they will always be there.

It’s uncomfortable but not catastrophic) until I couldn’t hold it anymore. It actually resets your breathing plus proves to you that you have breath to hold. Someone who was struggling to breathe cannot hold their breath by choice. When you hold your breath until you no longer can, and breath out all that air, you will activate the part of your nervous system responsible for calming you down and prove to yourself that your body isn’t going to make you hold your breath until you pass out, it is still in control, not the anxiety.

She may actually figure out what she wants faster if you cool it, than show her that you’re the lost puppy that will keep coming back to her. If she is playing games however, this is someone who will be a nightmare if you had a relationship with her. Show her now that you’ve got more going on, and know your worth. People play games to get a response. As a woman who has done this, the hoped for reaction when I showed up was all his attention, and when I disappeared for him to be sad and not posting on social media, etc. I wanted to see the impact I could have on him. That’s not how you show care or love for somebody. This is not cool and not the behaviour of a well-adjusted person, just a scared little girl who needs attention. The guys eventually stopped reacting at all and left me on read and it’s what my ego needed. I’m sorry to say it but I see myself in your description of this girl.

So someone like this is usually a game player and it’s best not to get attached. She sounds like a little girl. Real women don’t play games, they just know what they want.

selfimprovement,f7kain1,t3_dwmxmt,1573800649.0,Yes definitely. But self discipline is a skill like any other: it has to be learned then practised.
Anxiety,f7kab97,t3_dwms8l,1573800401.0,"Good question. By accepting that you’re a human being not a human doing. Your only job is to be, and being alive means you’re going to have experiences good and bad and each of those is designed for you to learn what you need to learn to flourish in life. So when you understand that you’re a human being, not expected to get it right all the time, you see everything that happens to you as a lesson. You’re a being and in just being is where your worth is, it’s not in what you do. Once you realise that, you’re free to live and learn and know that mistakes are all part of the human experience, they don’t define you as a person. Not even your accomplishments define you. Rather than say “this is positive and this is negative” I think of it all as part of the human experience and evolution. Don’t attach so much importance to mistakes or achievements."
work,f7k9rc7,t1_f7k2jcw,1573799729.0,"Thankyou so much for your time. I will sleep easy now with that thought in my head. You’re right; she says she applies for 30 jobs a week, here’s hoping!"
Christianity,f7k8u9q,t3_dwm0z7,1573798661.0,"Losing a pet is devastating. I faced that this year and cried for days thinking of this question. I found comfort and perhaps an answer in Romans 8:22 which says “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.” The whole creation suffered the consequences of a fallen world but has the hope of restoration, that’s what “until now” means. It doesn’t say “all humankind groans” but all creation. That includes animals. It’s a nice thought that God gave us these pets to teach us something about unconditional love. I don’t believe they are meaningless to Him. There are scriptures about let everything that has breath praise God. God created everything to worship Him and God is glorified in the faithfulness, loyalty and love of a dog 100%."
socialanxiety,f7k8d3e,t3_dwmj4r,1573798123.0,"Do you actually not want to go as you don’t think you will have any fun or is it just because you’re anxious? The first reason , then I would encourage you to think there’s no obligation to go to a Christmas party for work and leave it at that. We place way more importance on this than others. At parties people don’t really care who didn’t show up. The second reason I would encourage you to ask yourself what scares you and to not let fear stop you if you really want to go. Can you go home if you aren’t comfortable? I have social anxiety and if I actually don’t want to go I won’t. But if I want to go and am just worried about being anxious, I go. Because it’s what I really wanted to do. You can’t let fear of anxiety stop you from what you really want to do. Because it will keep happening and make your world very small and your social life non existent. Start with: Do I really want to go?"
Christianity,f7k4vrh,t3_dwle1b,1573794758.0,"Don’t burn with a lust from a distance. Right now you have a fantasy. You need to come back to reality by talking to her like a normal person because that’s what she is. 

When you let fantasy overcome you, you are at risk of seeing her as an object that you need to attain to be happy instead of trying to make a healthy connection with her by communicating and getting to know her. She will either reciprocate or reject you, but it’s better than keeping your distance and this belief in your mind that everything about her is perfect getting stronger because it’s simply not true. She is a human and flawed like everyone else and you can’t know if you really like someone or if you’re even compatible with them until you are close to them. From a distance they can be anything you want - which is actually what some people with a crush prefer so they will never try to get closer because they don’t want to know who they really are because they’re in love with their idea of the person. But if you actually want a shot at this girl in real life, you need to be brave and take a risk."
selfimprovement,f7k4jng,t3_dwleh8,1573794473.0,Sadly people like to know you’re there when they need someone. It’s not about you; its about them. You are probably a source of comfort because she knows you are available. In my experience people who do this are unstable. They like you but more for the feelings you give them not for you. They like that you’re there. When people are feeling like they need somebody they will text and reach out to whoever is available. When they ghost you it’s because they no longer have a void that needs to be filled. Something else has their attention now. I have learned to let go of those people and when they text I wait to text back or don’t reply at all. You don’t ghost people who mean something to you. Some people just like that you’re available when they need you. But they don’t care when you need them.
Anxiety,f7k3zm0,t3_dwltoy,1573794011.0,Absolutely normal and healthy and you should do it. You don’t have to be with people to do so. You are more than able to revisit familiar places and the warm feelings you get from them without including other people. It’s when we’re alone that we can do our best reflecting anyway. It sounds like an awesome idea.
Anxiety,f7k321n,t3_dwlmwh,1573793299.0,"I do this too... but I think it’s just part of being alive as a human being. It’s a universal anxiety. Mostly everyone has these moments. We rethink what we could’ve, should’ve, didn’t do/ say in a situation. The truth is we can never really know what anyone we interacted with thought and we have no control of it anyway.  We all say stupid things as well. Most people if asked “what do you mean by that?” actually wouldn’t be able to tell you. I like the saying “what people think of me is none of my business.” We don’t need to waste leisure time trying to read someone’s mind. They’re probably not thinking about you at all- and what if they were just thinking positive things? And look at it this way: if you’re thinking about how you came across in an interaction, chances are that’s what other people think about. What did they think of ME?"
work,f7k1wkx,t1_f7k19cq,1573792413.0,"Absolutely. She’ll say “I wish I married into money” not her Australian husband. Sometimes I just want to say bitch you went from hiding from bombs to living in Australia. That’s wealth. Shut the hell up. 

Thanks so much for your advice. I’m tired of her mind games. I’m tired of thinking about her. I feel like going on another happy hour with her and recording everything she says about the company and the boss then hold it over her head."
work,f7jxco3,t1_f7jwwc5,1573788898.0,"I appreciate this. I don’t stand up for myself and I have continuously encountered people like her. What’s the science behind being friendly though? Why does she alternate between that and being a bitch? When I did report her and move desks and stop talking to her after going to HR, she wrote the letter and came crying to me. Is she just unstable? She also seems to like to make out that she’s my ally, so she’ll make me distrust everyone else."
work,f7jvl2m,t1_f7jut9x,1573787608.0,"Thanks so much for the advice :) but she does suck up to people while treating me like crap so I don’t know if anyone else has complained. Telling me not to tell anyone she hit me felt so condescending. As well as “it’s not hard to hit you.” I feel a lot of rage about that comment as I don’t really know what she meant by it. She buys me the drink, asks me to join her and then does that. And I thought she was my friend!"
work,f7jv6of,t1_f7jus7e,1573787302.0,I agree. Would HR be interested in someone who was badmouthing the company though?
Anxiety,f7juq6g,t3_dwk6fs,1573786965.0,Not visible at all. I remember one terrible attack where I felt like my jaw was shaking and my mouth was drooping  and my friend was sitting across the table from me asking me what I wanted to order for lunch. I felt like a volcano about to erupt. So my experience is it’s not visible to others. I’ve even had people tell me I’m “so chill” when 90% of my day is spent resisting a full blown panic attack!
Anxiety,f7jr087,t1_f7jqid3,1573784317.0,Ah yes. I hate my emails. I’m on a two week break so I am dreading the emails I will be going back to! I feel freaking awful arriving at work for all the reasons you mentioned. All that small talk and “hello” with people who don’t really like us because we don’t really like them either and they can sense it. Gotta love the workplace.
work,f7jqjdk,t3_dwjvdn,1573783983.0,"Ugh I know this feeling. I faced the same situation early into my current job. The people I clicked with all quit within weeks. I ended up staying and things turned around for awhile but I’m ready to go again now and just keep looking for a new job. See it as: it’s money in the meantime though it sucks and it’s not forever. Definitely don’t bail without something else to go to. You should never run away from something, only run toward something else.  I know how your feeling, it SUCKS to be where you are not thriving or happy and nothing gets better, but the next thing will surely come. But don’t leave until there’s somewhere else to go. Nothing is worse than the uncertainty of unemployment. I HATE where I am and can’t wait to go, and instead of being miserable I get my joy and energy from knowing that I am actively looking for something else and it will happen for both of us. All the best."
Christianity,f7jlkla,t3_dwik1e,1573780329.0,"Ask yourself how you react when you read of some terrible crime. Maybe child or animal abuse or just unimaginable cruelty committed by someone. My response is anger and the need for justice. We are made in God’s image. He is a God of justice. He punishes evil. Plain and simple. People aren’t created evil, it is a free will decision. If God had created robots , then He would be abusive for punishing sin because it was programmed for humans to sin. But He created humans with the freedom to choose between right and wrong. If You were the creator, You would reserve the right to punish bad and reward good. The God of the Bible is no different. It would be abusive and cruel if we couldn’t differentiate between good and evil. But we can, and we have the free will to do either.  God is not responsible for what we choose to do with our free will. If you break the law, you go to jail. If you break God’s laws, there are also consequences."
Christianity,f7jjgrz,t1_f7jhroj,1573778961.0,"God does not pardon sin and wrong doing. He gives us another chance. We give the people who do wrong by us another chance, but that doesn’t mean we excuse the behaviour. God has not decided to never punish sin. Forgiveness doesn’t make us a pushover. Forgiveness doesn’t mean : I will allow you to walk all over me. Forgiveness is not weakness. Reluctance to forgive can come from a place of, I don’t want to lose power. If I forgive this person, I have given them the power to keep hurting me because I pardoned them. But forgiveness can be the message: I don’t condone what you did, but I give myself the gift of letting go of the hurt I carry and any bitterness I feel toward you, and I extend grace to you to free you of any guilt you feel and trust that you will do better from now on. When I ask for forgiveness, what I am asking for is another chance, so that’s what I believe of others. To be deprived by the people we hurt of another chance to do better is painful and it’s also sin to withhold that chance from someone as imperfect as we are, when God being PERFECT does not withhold it from us."
Christian,f7jh2ol,t3_dwbbib,1573777463.0,"Conviction is not condemnation. If the voice isn’t steering you towards a better course by telling you how you can do better it’s not of God, it’s the devil. The devil will just tell you that you are hopeless and have no future, there won’t be any encouragement in it. Just a strong urge to give up. The devil cannot inspire hope. He has none himself."
Christianity,f7jgm2p,t3_dwi9zk,1573777177.0,"Forgiveness is the power of God in us. That’s an awesome thing to think about. People say speaking in tongues is true evidence of the Holy Spirit living within a believer, but I believe it’s the ability to forgive. We were given grace when we were undeserving and to extend grace to those we deem undeserving of it is a strength we wouldn’t have if not for God demonstrating it first."
Anxiety,f7jdc0r,t3_dwhfcr,1573775233.0,"I’m sorry you are feeling this way. But anxiety and depression sometimes really does come out of nowhere and isn’t based on circumstances at all. That’s why “I’d be happy/ less anxious if I had x, y,z” doesn’t work. I think it’s less about what we have and more about what the condition of our soul is.  Just like having someone doesn’t take away someone’s loneliness, or having a job doesn’t mean being fulfilled. 

It might be that you need to look inward not outward. It’s entirely possible for the outer life to be fine but the inner person to be miserable. Contentment with life is different to contentment with self. There’s a chance that you’re wrestling with yourself about something that is stealing your peace even though you look around and think to yourself “everything is fine, and I SHOULD be happy.” It’s good that you can recognise what you have, but that doesn’t necessarily equal happiness. I never imagined someone with the money to book a flight and a hotel somewhere exotic at a moments notice could be depressed but they are. Because happiness has to come from within, first. 

You’re content with your life, but are you truly content within yourself, as in if you lost everything, is having YOU enough? I asked myself this and the answer was honestly no, my happiness depends on what I have and who I have. If you feel this way too, that’s the source of your mood swings. The subconscious knowing that you’re not actually happy being you. You need people, surroundings and events to make you feel OK, and when they don’t measure up as they often won’t- you don’t know how to stay in a good mood. Trust me, I know that feeling. 

I’m sorry if that was way off track, but I related to what you’re saying and I found after a lot of introspection that that was the answer for me. I wish you true peace and happiness."
Anxiety,f7jbhhj,t3_dwhqt9,1573774198.0,"Me too! To the point where it has caused problems for me at work because I don’t ask for help when I don’t know something. 

I wish I knew why. How is your self confidence? I think it has something to do with lack of confidence. I remember back at school that people who always put their hand up were confident and liked themselves enough to realise that asking for help doesn’t mean I am useless. It means i am learning something and will be able to do it by myself (or help someone else) next time. Asking for help can be empowering."
Anxiety,f7j06u3,t3_dwfyv7,1573768421.0,"Hi, yes I can relate to feeling anxiety before work. The hours leading up to and the drive there is almost unbearable. I hate the initial arrival part. You’re experiencing anticipatory anxiety. You’re subconsciously dreading the day ahead because of what could go wrong. It gets better once you’ve been at work awhile because the hours passing is a relief when we are anxious. But when all that time lays ahead, we feel anxiety."
Sjogrens,f7dmfsi,t1_f7dlnim,1573621257.0,"Yep! I had this symptom for years but chalked it up to anxiety which I also had but now I wonder how much of it was actually sjogrens. Thanks for the eye drops suggestion, I don’t think I have ever used gel, just drops. Is gel different?"
Sjogrens,f7dmb6h,t1_f7dirk1,1573621137.0,Oh yes i can definitely relate to the last three things there. And I always feel relief from all the above once I am outside in fresh air again.
Sjogrens,f7dm7xm,t1_f7dgb6o,1573621052.0,"I have social anxiety as well so when you say the environment, I think that might contribute to my disoriented and overall crappy feeling in malls."
TrigeminalNeuralgia,f7apfix,t1_f77dgxz,1573535547.0,Sorry to hear. I think this is probably what I have too. :(
TrigeminalNeuralgia,f7ape5v,t1_f782uhj,1573535514.0,Whoa that’s something I’ve never considered and would make sense because I have sinus problems on that side. Many thanks for the suggestion.
