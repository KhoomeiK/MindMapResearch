Because of this hurt, he has developed this armor, shields to protect himself and other coping mechanisms that allow him to operate in this world But these mechanisms, do not serve him well in our culture or in society, thus the struggles.

If it ever does become necessary or helpful to notify someone at work, find out what the polices are regarding asking for accommodations at work first. If a large employer, they will probably have an HR dept and polices and procedures. You maybe want to not say ""BPD,"" but only say a ""psychological disorder"" that impacts your work or your attendance and have a letter from a treating professional asking for X-accommodation/s. 

Before asking for the accommodations research which ones you think would help you or you need at work and have that included in the letter too. I am thinking of things like: short breaks (to go breathe or relieve stress), maybe preferential scheduling if there is someone at your work that pushes your buttons that you could be scheduled to work opposite them or not scheduled to work with them at all, but in a different area, etc.

2. Keep doing the best/next thing. Just keep doing what is best, doing what is next.  
3. Practice self care to the extent possible. (Take a moment for yourself, a deep soak in a tub, a cup of coffee, go for a walk, sit in the sun for 10-20 mins., take a multi-vitamin, watch a comedy or sit-com.) Exercise is also very good to lift the spirits and boost energy.  
4. Meditate or pray (if you feel likt it).   
5. Wake up and think of what you are grateful for. Every. Day.  
6. Start a gratitude journal and write in it as often as possible, hopefully daily. It really makes a difference.  
7. When you are able, find yourself a listening ear, a professional one (a BCSW, LPC or Psychologist). As soon as you have found one who is a good fit, try to see them as often as you are able.

These guys are someone's son, someone's brother, just a guy who would like to not spend his entire life alone. Be kind. Be courteous. Be empathetic. Geez."
BPD,fhexnm6,t3_f2u3ga,1581532010.0,"Follow the rules, take your meds, go to therapy there, work on yourself and getting better. You are in a safe place and you will get better there. Just try to be kind to yourself and the people around you (the staff will treat you better if you are polite).  


Improvement doesn't happen overnight. Make a promise to yourself to work on yourself when you are discharged. Keep working. Sometimes it is one step forward, one step back, but more steps forward than back and eventually you get to a better place.   


Be strong. Be kind. Love others."
utdallas,fgnwbtb,t3_ezahky,1580954308.0,"We all have anecdotal evidence based on our subjective experiences and what we have heard others say or read in venues like this. Hearsay can become very contorted, exaggerated and widespread. Do we have any way to verify or quantify our evidence? We do not unless there have been reports to safety agencies that regulate food service industry. Anything else is just “he said, she said.” We have to use verifiable facts that we can measure and evaluate in a meaningful way. After all, “quality” is fairly subjective.

UTD has a contract with Chartwell for the operation and service of the dining hall and other food venues on campus. Chartwell is a commercial food service company that specializes in education facilities, such as schools and college campuses. They have had the contract for UTD since 2008 and got a renewal in 2018. It was renewed in 2018 for eight years.

UTD is very aware of concerns over dining hall quality of food. They only thing they can do is enforce the contract with Chartwell and make sure the food is 1) safe, 2) enough in quantity, and 3) the quality agreed upon in the contract.

Quality of food can be very subjective. Some people shop at Whole Foods, others shop bargain store, visit food pantries and shop for bargain cuts of meat. Food standards vary widely from developing countries to developed countries. I doubt if there is one standard of food quality among all Comets.

Here is the most recent food safety inspection from the City of Richardson:[https://discovery.cor.gov/Public/health/HealthTrak.nsf/webScoresForReadonlyAll/11348\~95\~12/09/2019?OpenDocument](https://discovery.cor.gov/Public/health/HealthTrak.nsf/webScoresForReadonlyAll/11348~95~12/09/2019?OpenDocument) Note that UTD Dining Hall has never received a score lower than 91 of 100. A score in the 60's would be needed to close a food venue.

If we want improvements we need to report suspected cases of food borne illness to the agency responsible for inspections.

Here is the form to report suspected cases of food borne illness from any restaurant or UTD dining facility:
