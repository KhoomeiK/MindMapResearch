**Excerpt** \- He comes close enough to the cauldron – from which smoke now rises in  spirals, the surface gleaming like mother of pearl – that this time when  he catches the scent, he recognizes it. ”Wait,” he says. ”You're making  *perfume*?”

Malfoy looks at him with a raised brow and a  strange, lop-sided simper. ”What perfume?” he asks, which seems like an  odd question.

”The one you're always wearing, isn't it?”

As their eyes meet now, the expression on Malfoy's face, hard to read as it is, makes Harry wish he hadn't spoken.

”No fucking *way*.”"

\- people knowing exactly what the other person wants/likes the first time they have sex, without them talking about it whatsoever.  
\- too many/weirdly specific descriptions of how people smell and taste. Sure, there can be specific scents due to aftershave and lotions etc., but... most people smell and taste ""human"" in a way you can't describe. And I think it's awfully overused to describe it as someone having just eaten something - always something ""sexy"" such as strawberries or chocolate - and the other person tasting that in their mouth. It usually makes me roll my eyes.  
\- super complicated descriptions of positions/limbs going different directions, giving you a mental image of a Twister game. Often you end up realizing that something happening in the scene isn't actually anatomically possible.  
\- the exaggerated reactions during sex that has already been mentioned several times, like screaming etc. I worry that people writing such scenes are virgins that will be awfully disappointed once they start having sex if they imagine it is actually like that.  
\- writers thinking that for a sex scene to be good/hot, the people included has to come at the same time. Not realizing this usually doesn't happen, and that people who are good in bed will go on until the other person (or people) have come even if they've already come themselves.

FanFiction,fc3lu3z,t3_eekr40,1577392757.0,"The best one I can think of is Dexter, from the show with the same name. He is a sociopathic protagonist, and it really works. I also agree with the suggestion of Shaw from Person of Interest - great show and one of my fave characters ever.  


Have to say btw, I disagree with what you write in the third paragraph, ""... contradicts the reason people read books..."" I read books because I find it interesting, I like interesting characters, and a character can be very damn interesting even if I don't empathize with them. Emotionally connecting with the protagonist is not my motivation for reading. There are a lot of emotionally cold/disconnected main characters, and it works as long as they are written well.  


Worth noting, based on what it says in some other comments; sociopath is not a clinical term, the clinical term is Anti-Social Personality Disorder. The terms sociopath/psychopath are unofficially used sometimes, though. And although 'incapable of love' isn't a criteria for the disorder, people that have it are not capable of genuine, loving and healthy relationships, despite what a lot of fanfiction authors wants to think. (I'm thinking of the many fics I've come across where a character with ASPD is characterized as loving and empathetic as long as they are with that one special person. That isn't how it works.)"
FanFiction,fc3khyy,t3_edwlzf,1577391820.0,"I'm not currently, have experienced it though. If you're exhausted that does indicate you need breaks. However I disagree with the idea that some people are expressing that doing things the way you are will definitely lead to burn out. Writing isn't inherently stressful for the brain, creative work is good for you. There are authors who work solely with writing who write many, many hours per day every day, after all.  


Also, watching tv or playing a video game like someone suggested definitely isn't relaxing for your brain and in no way a good way to take a break. If you need a mental break, taking a walk is a good idea, especially in nature. Exercising in a natural environment is unmatched when it comes to relaxation and recharging your head and body. Give your brain a pause from output/input, and especially a pause from bright screens."

The idea of goldfish in bowls is especially problematic since goldfish needs BIG tanks and well oxygenated water. Goldfish in bowls die young because they can't grow properly, whereas goldfish that are properly cared for can live for many many years and grow to be very big. (In my country there are actual laws in place against keeping fish in bowls.)

There is also an issue with the curved glass; it causes disorientation for the fish and makes bowls even worse than a square tank of the same size. But even Bettas aren't supposed to be kept in such small enclosures, and I have no idea how the idea came to be that they somehow don't need more than a liter of water to live in.

AskReddit,ew25vcl,t1_euibwd5,1565038944.0,"It will definitely have been hard enough; as someone said, a horse can feel a fly sitting on it. If it doesn't move when you kick it, it's not because it's not hard enough. Ofc you could kick hard enough that the horse start moving because it gets painful, but in that scenario it just as well might end with the horse throwing you off to get rid of the discomfort.  


Most likely you were holding the reins too hard or shifting your weight in such a way that you were telling the horse to be still, to back up, and go forward at the same time. Also with horses it's never about brute force, it's about actually -communicating- with the horse and making sure it's listening. Example; at the stable I'm at there are some dudes who work as, I suppose janitors or something like that. They handle the horses a bit, but aren't properly trained or have experience with it. One time when we were taking some horses in, one of the ponies stopped to eat grass and refused to go in. This one guy, taller, bigger and definitely a lot stronger than me, grabbed the pony by two tufts of its mane and tried to pull it with him by brute force. Ofc even a pony is stronger than most adult males, so it ignored him. The dude was treating it more like he was pulling a heavy dead object with him, but not actually *telling* the horse to come with. It's very hard to explain how to do that, and I think something you mostly learn by experience. I told him ""it's ok, I'll take him."" I then took the pony by the fringe with one hand, and led him in. I ""told"" the horse we were going in, rather than try to physically pull him with me or timidly ""asking"" (with my body language/energy) whether he felt like going in, which he didn't. The horse will know you're there, and it'll feel that you're kicking it, but if you're either giving mixed signals or not really communicating with it at all, it's likely to ignore you. In some cases with very sensitive horses, they might freak out in some way because they get so confused."

The point isn't that if the thing you obsess about is technically positive, like a musician, it can't be OCD. The point is whether the obsession leads to compulsions, unwanted behavior and anxiety.
