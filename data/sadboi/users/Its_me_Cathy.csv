My husband was never a small guy, and he's gained 80 lbs since we met due to the side effects of several psychiatric medications. He is, like your husband, tall and handsome, and I honestly have not lost my attraction to him. He thinks he looks like Comic Book Guy; I think he looks like a Celtic god. I will say, though, that I doubt we'd still be able to have sex were I not built slightly. 

However, I am TERRIFIED that he is living on borrowed time. It is not super unusual to hear of men in their 30s and 40s dropping dead of a heart attack these days, and he seems like a prime candidate. He can't seem to stop eating because of the drugs and because he is an emotional eater; he can't exercise because of the strain his weight puts on his joints, among other reasons. 

He takes my genuine concern for his health as condescension and judgement. I'm accused of being a health Nazi and ""thinking I know everything"" because I'm vegan. Really, I just don't want to be a young widow. My fears make me want to disengage emotionally, which is wrecking our marriage."
