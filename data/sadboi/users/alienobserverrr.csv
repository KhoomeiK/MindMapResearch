ptsd,fpczg9s,t3_gckhxc,1588516502.0,I definitely get this. I think when I'm not getting much support and I'm stuck in a rut I just dissociate until it passes or life changes a bit.
Grimes,fpcz3dh,t1_fpcaglx,1588516270.0,I know... I could never understand Elon stans. It gets depressing.
COVIDTraumaSupport,fpcyr6d,t1_fpc3rat,1588516051.0,I get this. I have an autoimmune disease as well as PTSD and an eating disorder. Not much of it is visible besides my miserable resting face (hah!) but healthy people I know still going out and socialising during this time is really grating. I'm home with family but it's extremely toxic and they forget I'm struggling too so the support is really on/off...

ANGEL,fpcxsc2,t1_fpb7y4p,1588515404.0,"Actually it seems true to the show too. I always felt like in Angel hardships were shown honestly and true to life minus the demons etc. None of the characters seem to get a ""happy ending"" but they keep going and face every obstacle, like in real life, and the show's finale sort of captured that (in my opinion)."

I've always felt like an alien like something wasn't right about me compared to everyone else around me. Now it's even worse after repeated heavy traumatic events, constantly on edge, heart palpitations, getting dizzy and sick. I can barely eat or sleep or function at all and feel constantly like I could end everything, and I'm so disconnected from everyone. Nothing around me seems real or right.

CPTSD,fnta26t,t3_g3l64a,1587237535.0,"Exactly, I think about this so often... In an ideal world mental health issues are quick and temporary with a little therapy fix and in 3 months time we're good to go and relationships are all easy without any baggage to bring. It's just unrealistic. Part of me has no hope in the idea that anyone could actually love me for who I am with my mental issues but maybe it just means you have to find someone understanding enough and that you have a big enough connection with... And maybe that's just rare."
depression,fnt9qw0,t3_g3ljni,1587237356.0,"I feel this. And actually it describes how relationships are with me too. Depressing as hell, I can barely connect with anyone meanwhile empathy also sucks the life out of me haha."

buffy,fjxburw,t3_esma6q,1583666726.0,"I relate to this heavily. I was sexually assaulted several times while also dealing with mental health issues that I've had for a long time. After events happen everyone moves on so fast while you have to suppress your feelings so that you don't cause more upset or become a burden to them. I still haven't been able to talk to anyone about it since it happened and am finding the only way to keep on is to go about it in a robotic way so that no emotions can get in so aa not to utterly crumble... Watching buffy's journey through what almost mirrors how I feel always helps so much, the only comfort I can find anywhere anymore. I'm so sorry you had to deal with something so traumatic too."

My body physically aches like I'm carrying something heavy on my back and shoulders and in order to keep going through the day I'm left with a permanent scowl because I don't have the energy to appear happier to disguise it ugh"
