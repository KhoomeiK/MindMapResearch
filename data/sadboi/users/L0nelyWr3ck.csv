* Can I assign stat blocks to all the monsters ahead of game? Whatâ€™s the easiest way to do this?

Monsters/npcs relevant to the module and any compendium (Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters, etc) that you own will all have their stat blocks already. Sometimes, when you click on the sheet it'll ask if you want to edit it, just click edit manually and it'll change nothing (the stats and such are there but a glitch thinks it's not there when it is.). Any monster/npc not relevant to the module or in an owned compendium, will have to be manually added. 

To do this: 

1: Create a character.

2: Make it an NPC (it'll ask the first time you go to the character sheet to make them)

3: Have the stats available to fill in what's needed.

4: Hit the gear icon on the right to show the character sheet where you can't edit anything. It all auto saves, so there is no save button to click in this part.

5: Go back to the Bio & Info screen (not necessary as you can just click the Edit button on the top right to do this without going there) and add the image where it says Avatar. If you have a token maker website ( [Token Stamp](https://rolladvantage.com/tokenstamp/) is a good free one), make a token there first otherwise it'll show it as an image, not a typical token. Add the name of the monster/npc. Then save it.

6: Repeat steps 1-5 until all monsters/npcs not available are added.

&#x200B;

 

* Is there a way of keeping the initiative tracker in descending order?

1: Open the initiative tracker/Turn order (looks like a clock on the menu thing on the left)

2: Have everyone roll initiative, including you for all of your controlled characters being sure to remember to click the token before clicking initiative (can always manually add or redo it and add the original roll by editing it in the tracker \[click the number and you can edit it\])

3: Once everyone has rolled and it shows on the tracker, click the blue gear icon. In the sort options next to Numerically area, click descending and it will sort it with the highest initiative roll on top. Close the settings box by hitting the x on the upper right. Then as each character's turn is over, hit the arrow and it'll move to the next one."

For example, one freebie redo but any others must come when it happens within the game (character death) and not actively trying (purposely doing things that doesnt make sense in hopes of getting killed so they can make a new character, etc...) to do.

Either way, you've shown a complete lack of willingness to even try to see things outside of what you CHOOSE to see, I'm done even bothering."
PublicFreakout,fmh0pd9,t1_fmgzzzs,1586063115.0,"And you continue to ignore everything that is present just because it allows you to feel good about your stance. The fact that you think anything i said validates your original reply is funny because all i did was further expand on my comment to make it clearer on what i was saying. It must be nice to have tunnel vision but the world doesn't work that way. You need to see everything to make a judgement call. You choose to only see the dog attack because to do otherwise would show exactly why some people immediately jump to calling it animal abuse. Whereas i look at all of it and while the guy was right in defending himself, it's easy to see why others call it animal abuse. Not my problem you choose to only focus on one aspect when there are multiple aspects available."
PublicFreakout,fmgz6me,t1_fmgxp81,1586061873.0,"Wow i literally just agreed with you. I am just pointing out the FACTS of it, outside of just the dog attacking the person, as well. Rather convenient that someone was recording right at the EXACT moment the dog attacked. Rather convenient the other person there made no attempt to help the person being attacked. Rather convenient there were people cheering it all on. Notice how the dog completely ignored the other guy there. The guy also made no real attempt to get away from the dog. One spin and throw would have given him ample time to get away. Hell after slamming it to the ground before spinning probably would have given him time to get away. Put ALL OF THE FACTS into focus and you can easily see why people jump to the conclusion it's animal abuse. I'm not arguing anything. I am simply putting it all into perspective beyond just a dog attacking. All you're focusing on is the dog attacking and ignoring everything else that is present (or not present - anything that happened directly before the attack). Notice how i didn't once say it was animal abuse, yet you're assuming I'm defending those that did? Look at everything, not just what you want to see. Basing it off of everything you can see why people would jump to that conclusion."
PublicFreakout,fmgxk2z,t1_fmgx6t4,1586060562.0,"While i agree, we don't see anything that happens prior to the dog running at him. Top it off with the cheering, the other guy there doing absolutely nothing to help and it being recorded. There are a lot of questions unanswered."
maybemaybemaybe,fmgva01,t1_fmgubl0,1586058770.0,My thoughts exactly. Context would be nice.
trashy,fmdu2s0,t1_fmdu0os,1585977967.0,Exactly.

Whatcouldgowrong,fm679ne,t3_ftc9jw,1585787792.0,Not a matter of height at all. It's a matter of using a wet bench to jump off of. Her foot slipped the moment she put pressure down to boost her jump.

offmychest,fm5vcj5,t1_fm5qykc,1585780702.0,Then it sounds like time to move on. You can either tell them of your plans or just ghost them. Your choice on what you're comfortable doing.
offmychest,fm5eu1z,t3_ft2btt,1585771614.0,"The best thing to do is to just tell them that you want more than what they're currently giving and if they can't meet you halfway, then it time to move on. Sucks, but its better than continuing on the current path."
