Turns out an old friend works in the DA’s office in the county I have my DUI in. He reached out to say hi and I realized how fucked the court systems are right now.

I have an actual skill set I could use, I’m hoping they just assign me community service editing PSAs or something. 

That’s the thing, honestly. I haven’t had a drink since the day this happened, I completely blacked out and managed to get my car from the Castro to Redwood City, and it scared the shit out of me. I’d never had a functional black out like that before. Losing control like that and being vulnerable like that, never mind I could have killed someone, made drinking profoundly un-fun. I was never much of a drinker anyway, and this sealed the deal. I’m grateful I was given this opportunity to re-evaluate my actions. I think there should be a punishment. I hurt the community, I think I should have to give back to the community. But if I can’t afford the IID and the extra insurance because I’m laid off right now, then I can’t drive in case of an emergency. During the pandemic, it makes me feel so unsafe.

AM:

-toner (if needed)
-moisturizer for oily skin (not too heavy)
-SPF (non-tinted)

PM: 
- Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing oil
(Leave on for 1-2 minutes, wet fingers and massage skin to emulsify, rinse)
-La Roche-Posay Toleriane Face Wash
-AHA toner (lactic or glycolic acid, no more than 10% solution)
-moisturizer 

Here’s my opinion: 

Ditch the Differin/acne spot treatment and Elta Tinted SPF for now. 

Tinted means it has foundation in it, and makeup generally isn’t great for skin. Elta does make non-tinted sunscreen, but it’s billed as moisturizing - which means oily. (I use it, but I have dry skin. I’ve heard good things about Neutrogena SPF for oily skin.) Only apply SPF in the morning.

Differin is a retinol. While retinol does fade acne scars, it might be a little too intense for your skin, especially if you’re following it with a salicylic acid treatment.  I would use a mild AHA (try The Ordinary’s Lactic Acid 5%) at night, alternating nights that I use the Differin. I might also consider adding an Alpha Arbutin, Vitamin C, or Niacinamide treatment to my morning routine if I had issues with acne scars/marks, but these products can add to sun sensitivity. 

Good luck!"

I really responded to your metaphor of swimming against a current. In that are the ideas of life’s ebbs and flows/tides, drowning, succeeding. 

Have you tried meditating on, instead of fighting the tide, stopping your resistance? In real life, the way to escape a rip tide is to swim with the current or float so you don’t exhaust yourself and drown. My friend told me when she feels like she’s drowning, she imagines swimming to the surface and taking a breath. I wonder if a similar mental image would help you find solutions/work arounds/accommodations to your current situation.

Getting through the day-to-day, create as much structure as possible. I just made a chores/self-care list I can check off throughout the day, which helps keep me organized. 

Get yourself back to baseline, and then tackle more complex self-improvement projects. Good luck!"

relationship_advice,fcuu1s1,t3_eiyhsn,1577988492.0,"Thank you for sharing your story here. You’re definitely making the right choice and you should feel proud of how strong you are!

Reading about how you feel about your body and if you are desirable as a dating partner, I just wanted to share this:

I have a work friend who is fit and attractive. We were talking about intermittent fasting and he told me he used to be 300lbs and pulled out his phone to show me a picture of him before he lost the weight. 

This guy is great at his job - like one of my favorite people to work with in the area. He’s great at his job because he’s an understanding, lighthearted, kind person with this laser focus that somehow never makes him seem high-strung. He just can juggle all these different needs without making anyone feel like they’re putting him out and it’s amazing.

Sometimes he’s self-deprecating about his body. It’s so frustrating because he looks great, and also the chubby boy in the picture he showed me? Still attractive. He’s always been attractive because of who he is, no matter the size. It’s in his eyes and smile.

I know he looks at that picture and sees all the shame, depression, and self-loathing he felt during that time. Putting on physical weight will always carry an emotional weight only he can see. 

Looking forward, I urge you to recognize all these layers of emotional pain you are feeling and remember that, to the right people, on the outside, it looks like depth of character. The guy I work with, once he shared his story with me, I’m just even more impressed with his drive and work ethic. And if he was still 300lbs? I would still be impressed and love working with him. He lost the weight to feel more authentically like himself, but it’s always been the same soul in there

Good luck!"

relationship_advice,fcjqdpf,t3_ehcmfv,1577699351.0,"TL;DR: Talk to her! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

As a woman who has sex with men, I can tell you condom-less sex feels amazing. There’s nothing quite like skin-to-skin contact with your partner, especially when you’re in love. That being said, birth control and STI checks are a must. There are so many forms of birth control that work in lots of different ways, so I can’t imagine none of them work for her. I would say grab a copy of Our Bodies, Ourselves (actually a really dope book on sexuality), flip to the section on all the forms of bc, and the next time she brings up foregoing the condom, just be straight with her - “that sounds so hot, but I want to be responsible about this. Let’s find a kind of birth control that works for us and get a free STI check.” Also, figure out if you have the same opinions about abortions and agree to a plan if you did get pregnant. 

It might not seem romantic, but having sex is also this thing that can have these huge consequences. This situation requires this grown up conversation where you don’t avoid each other or accuse each other, you instead take care of each other by communicating. It will bring richness to your sex life in the end"
