BipolarReddit,f3za7yw,t1_f3yfafu,1571264814.0,"For me it’s housing costs. The only thing I can afford with my budget at the moment is nothing at the moment (I’m living with my ex, mostly a SAHM because childcare is a minimum of $700/month). I’ve been looking hard but I can’t even afford the baseline of $700 for a 400 sq ft cabin with no running water 40 minutes from town."

BipolarReddit,f08xwv9,t1_f08uk0y,1568490057.0,"They just wouldn’t put in the actual request for the med, the first time I had called them in the day before and received all my meds except my anti-depressant, so I was like ok well I’m busy I will come back later, so I come back 1.5 hours after and they tell me no one ever put the request in...well I need the med so I’ll have someone else pick it up later. They get there 10 minutes to closing and are turned away because it was too busy and the request was put in too late in the day so they didn’t have time to fill it. So that’s the story of how I went of Wellbutrin and somehow managed to avoid falling hard into the pit of despair. 

More recently they wouldn’t fill my adderal because they ‘didn’t have a script’ so my doctor called during one of our appointments and they actually had 5 scripts the people answering the phone just didn’t give a fuck"

BipolarReddit,f08puvk,t1_f07jfl8,1568485511.0,"It’s both in the US, they often overlap and wrap around the whole bottle making them impossible to remove. I like your system better, it’s probably cheaper and takes less time for the pharmacy"

And you guessed it right I got yelled at and still didn’t receive medical attention. 

I never thought of your first point though and I really appreciate you saying it, in my teens I would be screamed at because (I didn’t know if back then) I’m fucking bipolar with severe depressive episodes.
