Friday nights after school he‚Äôs allowed to watch cartoons or play video games. Saturday and Sunday morning he can have screen time so my husband and I can sleep in. Then we usually make him shut everything off around  9am or so for the rest of the day until the evening. And he has to have his laundry folded and put away Saturday before he can do evening screen time. He‚Äôs 8 1/2 and we‚Äôve been doing this for years (just recently added the laundry stipulation  though) Sometimes we‚Äôll be more lenient and let him watch a cartoon during lunch or something on the weekends or watch a movie together in the afternoon. 

With this lockdown we have been a little more lenient. He can do education stuff on his tablet during the day but not ALL day. He‚Äôs been reading a lot of books on his tablet since we‚Äôve been stuck at home. And we allow free screen time for a bit each evening if all his school stuff is done."
