Alienware,fr5s30x,t3_gmpq34,1589913716.0,"Get the one i'm using, IMHO best laptop in the market for 2019 and even 2020

AW 17Mi7-8750H w/ RTX - 2080 for two main reasons

1 - You can upgrade ram to 32, and it is a must if you plan to play games, i didn't complete a month and i was running out of ram with their onboard 16

2- Motherboard is not inverted as is the case with the newer m17 R2 and makes it easier to repaste your heat sink when it gets too hot

3 - Can replace the on-board 60 watt battery with 90W battery

4 - Can also replace the SSd card and install any size you want

&#x200B;

For this much upgradablity you'd be making a huge mistake to choose anything older or the atrocious new models where Alienware decided to remove all the above for a modern day gamer and just force you into their factory features, with a really bad laptop design M17 r1 beats M17 r2 in just about every category, i even prefer the classic alienware spaceship design to the newer ones.

What a dilemma, this ordeal is actually making me reconsider buying gaming laptops in the future, it is just not convenient,  for the price we pay you’d think the label “gaming” laptop means manufactures would invest more time into the stability of these machines and mainly the thermal temperatures of the CPU and GPU, I was initially hesitant to jump into the Max-q line up of NVIDIA cards but they do perform at significantly  lower temperatures, my last laptop was Aorus failed on my due to consistent heat overtime which damaged the IC chip.

2-4 years = dead GPU 

Always utilize undervolting + thermal pasting 

Otherwise consistent heat will over time result in bad solder joints in your GPU IC 

After this recent unpleasant experience, I’ve thought long about how to avoid this in my next laptop purchase.

And figured the only workaround to prolonging the lifespan of your internal GPU is by utilizing one of the modern features presented in having an External Graphics enclosure and utilizing the external GPUs which are provided with good ventilation and air flow unlike the cramped up mobile GPUs in your laptop.

Yes it is an expensive hack, but it would certainly prolong your laptops graphics card by few years unless you prefer to buy a new laptop every 3 years.
