I was too young to even vote in 2016, and if Bernie's not the nominee this year, I'm not voting at all. It's people like Joe Biden that lead to people like Trump. I'm almost certain Biden can't beat Trump head to head unless Trump has grown *that* unpopular. If Biden wins, he likely paves the way for an actual sophisticated Trump, which is *dangerous*, we should be counting our lucky stars that one of the most outwardly narcissistic presidents also happens to be an idiot. 

You say to educate people like it's simple. It's taking a pandemic (that is, bodies dropping around us) for people to realize that capitalism isn't the perfect system they once thought. If it takes a disaster for people to realize the error of their fundamental beliefs, how am I supposed to do it in a time of peace? People are very, very, averse to change."

worldpolitics,f2c50os,t1_f2bimyi,1570134428.0,"Aren't all hierarchies (just and unjust) maintained by at least implied violence though? The reason I, a homeless person (not really but it's an example), can't steal soup from a Walmart is because I'll be arrested despite, you know, the need for food and the fact that Walmart is always overstocked and will throw away tons of food anyway. This applies to a myriad of other things.

If I'm a woman in a very patriarchal society, I'm kept in line by the implicit and explicit threat of violence. I don't remember exactly when but there were women in India recently trying to get an education or something similar  and they were beaten in the street with sticks. Wuth women aware of what violence awaits them if they disobey the social order, they're far less likely to even try to revolt. When a child disobeys a parent to a certain extent they'll probably get spanked to be kept in line. 

Violence doesn't even have to be violent force either. 

Why don't more Americans (left or right) take the trip to DC protest the govt for (whatever reason they think is important enough to protest)? They can't afford to even if they wanted because they're kept poor by the way we distribute money so they can't risk taking off work (not to mention most people don't have much vacation time anyway). I'd argue that keeping someone just poor enough that they *have* to come into work the next Monday despite having the ability to, without *real* consequence (real* meaning no one's gonna die if McDonalds workers got paid a few dollars more. whether you think they should be paid more is a separate discussion but I hope you get my point here). 


So I guess my question is what are some hierarchies that are maintained without violent or at least the implied threat of it?"
