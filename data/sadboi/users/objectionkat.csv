It’s when you have a significant event related to an event where you believed yourself, or someone close to you (in proximity or emotionally), was in impending risk of serious harm or death. Then PTSD is essentially not being able to progress through the emotional trauma and being “stuck” at that point and then dealing with triggers that take you back to the traumatic event and you can’t let go of the events and memories. 

It takes a lot of emotional effort and strength. Not everyone is ready or stable enough to address the event. It’s not made easier by other mental health issues, chemical imbalances, poor/unhealthy coping skills.

The most helpful mantra I have is “your brain is not your friend”. Your brain’s job is to protect you and keep you safe. The things it says to you or wants you to focus on aren’t necessarily the most important for you, they’re the things your brain thinks you should be focusing on.

Self preservation is brain’s job. That’s not very helpful during school, there aren’t many life threatening things around but work is stressful and your brain can distract you with other stuff to avoid the stress and anxiety of doing things that are hard. It’s also a pain in the ass when you have some chemical based mental illness. 

Your brain is not your friend- learn tools, learn your behaviors, your stressors, your triggers, and know what to watch out for that are specific to you. Hang in there and don’t stop asking for help and reaching out to others. We are all going through our own stuff but it’s helpful to share with others."

Here are some things that help me when I get intrusive thoughts that relate to what I’m reading/working on:
- Writing things down will help get them out of your head. Even if it’s a list of things that you’re reading about that may apply to you, make a list of things to research or look into about you personally. Put it down, move on back to work, look into it later AFTER FINALS and final grades. 

- When you recognize you’re off task (in your head) you have consciously remind yourself to get on task. I made a sign for myself (folded over note card works) that says “On task!” Don’t hate on yourself for getting off task, it happens.

- Don’t hate on yourself. It’ll be ok. Make sure you are doing self-care behaviors: eat, sleep, shower, avoid drugs and alcohol, get some exercise and take breaks from studying to give your brain some relaxing rewarding time, but in moderation. 

- Be careful of distractions: Your family history, mental health diagnoses, your future, your medication, etc etc are going to try to get you off task. 

I don’t have medication suggestions, but my general suggestions are try to keep track or changes that you observe, write them down and roll with it. Hang in there"

It starts a good habit and while it sucks in the beginning, it starts a “rent/security deposit” fund for when you’re trying to get out. 

Also, given your family dynamic and situation, be careful about letting your family know you have “extra money.” Don’t flaunt it.  Your siblings will soon learn the expense associated with babies and you don’t want them to see you as someone who has money. You will have money because of your responsible child-free choices. You get to enjoy that and the guilt that can be thrown around can cause even more family issues before you can get out.

Nothing on this post has genuinely surprised me. 

Not saying it’s not disturbing, upsetting, nauseating or depressing. It is- all of it. However, when you’re a lawyer you’re expected to be able to manage it. I don’t want to be surprised in my job. I tell people that upfront, but then I hear all the awful. I know I won’t be able to do this forever and I’m still in my first decade of practice, but there is so much awful that often, the way that lawyers process this stuff is by talking about  it being fucked up and not normal, then moving on. You have to keep it compartmentalized in order to do your job. It’s awful, but someone has to do it. Lots of peoples cases are not awful- but the people’s whose cases are crazy are the ones that get the attention. 

My background is in counseling and psychology- I wanted to be a counselor but I learned how beneficial it is to have a mental health background in working with the population of people who come through the court system (Especially family law). 

I tell people often that they just need to hang in there and it gets better, once the audience is gone and the lawyers are gone (and they no longer have someone to call to complain that dad didn’t send kids home with the right shoes, or that Timmy didn’t go to soccer practice yesterday and they want other parent held in contempt of court) often things improve (or find a new balance whatever that is). The “in court” type is very emotionally/financially/psychologically draining for everyone. 

I recommend therapy/counseling to everyone going through a family case. Lawyers are not therapists, and while we listen, you can’t bill insurance for services. People need an avenue to process what’s happening and lawyers aren’t here for that- but it’s helpful when lawyers can identify maladaptive coping skills and reinforce healthy behaviors to detach and move on.

Mom was not a good mom and had tried to take the children from school that day too- had there not been a restrictive order not allowing her to take the kids out of school (this was a regular thing and she’d hide them for a few days in a hotel or at a family/friends house telling them how dad was trying to brainwash them and the judge was working with the Illuminati or other  conspiracy groups, etc.) I can only imagine what might’ve happened to them. Dad had been being abused by mom’s crazy, drug use, emotional instability and paranoia and got into therapy to deal with his anxiety issues and started getting help to set boundaries with wife’s behavior and the divorce ensued.

Silver lining is that Dad was an awesome dad and was patient with the kids and got the kids in therapy and helped them as much as he could. 

Lastly- I got to hear a lot about it from both sides attorneys just during the pretrial litigation, I wasn’t just hearing the bad stuff from Dad’s Attorney’s perspective, Mom’s Attorney was trying to get things stabilized and it just never happened. After the overpass incident the kids had supervised visits until she just stopped going. I’m sure the kids fear her showing up somewhere trying to “rescue” them from their “horrible father”. 

So much ptsd in family law."

AskReddit,eoq7xm0,t1_eoptuwx,1558787000.0,"I’m so sorry for what you went through. I know of a case where someone jumped off an overpass in a suicide attempt and lived, then just shook it off and kept fighting for custody like nothing happened. It was gruesome and I just felt awful for the kids.... bad parent awards..."
AskReddit,eoq7f27,t1_eop7u0e,1558786716.0,"This. As a family law attorney, this. I don’t do criminal except little thinks like trespassing or speeding tickets when my clients get arrested. I can’t “unsee” the things you see more frequently with criminal cases; in family law cases, the abuse, neglect, control issues, drug issues, mental health issues, codependency, domestic violence and emotional/mental abuse is the worst. 

The court doesn’t do anything unless it rises to a (high imo) level of abuse for the court to jump in and stop it and it has to be more than people being assholes or a little crazy. The court isn’t suppose to micromanage people’s lives and answering the question of “how could the judge/court let this happen?” Is one of frequent hard questions to answer. “You’re parent1 and they’re parent2 and you guys made babies and now you have to find a way to work as parents because it takes a lot for the state to get involved.” Is something that I have to tell people. That being said, i don’t say that in response to the kinds of stories in this thread- just the average people going through divorces using their children as manipulative chess pieces to fuck with their ex. 

I tell people I speak fluent drama and crazy, thats why I went into family law. Also, fuck Facebook.

Edit: missing words."

Also, do you have a counselor? That was very helpful for me"
pettyrevenge,eof8bmc,t1_eoeqy22,1558526565.0,Thank you!!! I like “bonus kid(s)” better :) I have two bonus littles and they make me so happy! Bonus mom’s get to do fun stuff that bio-moms don’t get to do.
