bipolar,fo7wpab,t1_fo7uxpn,1587585839.0,Yeah I really don’t like it. I’m going to try to take it with my sleeping pills tonight to see if that helps lessen the side effects.
bipolar,fo75j3i,t3_g621iz,1587572614.0,Interestingly I was exercising my everyday ever since I started on Latuda and stoppe a Couple of weeks ago for some reason. I should definitely get back into the routine of it! Thanks!
LifeProTips,fo6yf36,t3_g5vyer,1587569026.0,Why does this remind me of Stardew Valley...
bipolar,fo6wrb5,t1_fo6w9h8,1587568168.0,I take methoprazine for sleep at night so I don’t need much help with that but I do think taking it at night will help me sleep away the symptoms. For some reason I don’t like the idea of taking all of my pills at once? Which is probably silly but..
bipolar,fo6u89k,t1_fo6tmjh,1587566823.0,"Yes! It’s like I have so much energy but none at all. I feel as though Latuda has worked wonders for me over the last couple of months until now. It’s totally changed my perspective but I don’t think I could deal with this side effect forever. Actually, when I first started to take it I felt this symptom the first day and then it just randomly came back a couple months later. I have only had to ween myself off of cipralex when I was first diagnosed because it sent me into mania and that was bad enough. I have a feeling Latuda might be a lot worse."
bipolar,fo6tduu,t1_fo6syx6,1587566369.0,It’s such a strange feeling. I will ask my doc about those meds for sure. Even just not taking my meds this morning is making me feel way better. Im really hoping it will stop because I don’t feel like weening myself off my another drug blah. Thank you!
bipolar,fo6nfj4,t3_g5suab,1587562949.0,Wow!
bipolar,fmxe9rs,t3_fxmuy0,1586463367.0,This makes me happy. So cool!

bipolar,fms17t8,t1_fmrza1o,1586343051.0,At one point I was very quiet about thingsbut it seems that defence mechanism broke down for me. In fact I started to dissociate at the sight of any conflict. So I decided to be the complete opposite and start lashing out at people. Not great but I’m learning.
bipolar,fms10uh,t1_fmrop6r,1586342854.0,Thank you. 🥰
bipolar,fmqzpy9,t1_fmqw7dr,1586310583.0,That’s all I ask! Thank you so much.
bipolar,fmqjfm0,t1_fmqhkl6,1586300792.0,Luckily I have full coverage on my medication. I think I’ve been on it for about a month! But yeah I like it so far. Very few negative side effects for me although I have pretty bad restless legs at night sometimes but meh I can deal with it.
bipolar,fmqgmrh,t1_fmqgah0,1586299233.0,I am on Latuda and methoprazine right now it seems to be helping me a lot but I’m thinking they are going to continue upping my dose as I’m only in 40mg of Latuda and 25 of the methoprazine! The biggest effect I’m finding it has on me is recognizing the way I treat other people when I get into those moods. I can contain myself a little more now just sometimes it breaks through. Thank you for your words!

mycology,fle24mk,t1_fle1ryv,1585076162.0,Mushrooms and other fungi of north America by Roger Phillips is the #1 guide I use the most. It’s just suuuper easy to use and follow. I really like mushrooms of Ontario and eastern Canada  by George Barron but I’m not sure what your area in so I’m not sure how helpful these would be to you! A mor general one would be the ultimate mushroom book by Peter Jordan and Steven wheeler it has recipes for wild edibles you find and ID keys for mushrooms that you find. Another favourites for me is not pictured here called edible wild plants by Thomas S. Elias and Peter Dykeman: this one doesn’t have mushrooms in it but it is a season by season guide to all the different kinds of wild edibles around us!

mycology,fld9si7,t1_fld9lp1,1585059964.0,Yeah in my 7 years of thrift I don’t think I’ve seen that book or I would have it that’s for sure.
mycology,fld9cb2,t1_fld939a,1585059673.0,My one insect book is a golden guide that’s probably why it looks familiar ha.
mycology,fld98w1,t1_fld939a,1585059609.0,Ugh I work in a thrift store and I feel like I’ve seen this one before. Could just be the design is familiar but that would be a super cool book to read!

offmychest,fkvgnnf,t1_fkvg02b,1584568844.0,Idk maybe this is your coping mechanism right now man. It’s hard to comprehend death and maybe youre mind just doesn’t want to right now. Have you been to the funerals? This is a hard subject so hard to tell anyone how to grieve at all.
offmychest,fkvfuuz,t1_fkvbsrb,1584568383.0,How old are you? If you don’t mind me asking
offmychest,fkvahhh,t1_fkv1fru,1584565300.0,There is no scale of grief. Maybe you are lucky and don’t have to grieve in sorrow. Do you think about the good and bad time’s with the deceased?
offmychest,fkv11vf,t3_fkvez1,1584559912.0,"It’s not that abnormal I don’t think. I didn’t cry at a funeral or about death until my best friend died. Didn’t cry about my grandma, my grandpa nothin."

offmychest,fja61o8,t3_fcbsd5,1583167122.0, I’ve been with my husband for 10 years and we have had phases like this. Especially in the first 5 years of our relationship for some reason. We got married about 6 months ago now and our sex life is CRAZY good. Open communication is such a huge part of sex life. Not being afraid to bring up sensitive subjects when it comes to this can be detrimental. Just remember how many hard conversations you’ve had with your permanent and realize you made it through that. Now you have to have another hard conversation that you will also make it through.
offmychest,fja540x,t3_fccrcg,1583166573.0,Remember that just because you have an apparent “perfect” life doesn’t mean that you arnt allowed to struggle. Your struggle is YOUR struggle and no one else’s. this is what you know and no one else has felt how you feel. This isn’t saying that no one will understand though. This isn’t to say that your struggle is worse then others. This is to say that we all struggle. This is to say that we all have the right to feel comfortable talking about what we are struggling with. If someone says you have the perfect life when you do say something tell them to fuck off. My husband is severely depressed(medicated and stable now) and he used to feel so ducking bad about it for the same reasons. He has everything growing up except for the coping mechanisms he needed to emotionally be on his own. He had the perfect up bringing while I had a drug addicted mother with severe mental health problems and an abusive alcoholic father. He always said how bad he felt because he knew I was raised with a lot more turmoil but I was also raised to be more independent. There are so many factors that go into someone’s mental health that if someone wants to judge you they can go fuck themselves if you ask me.
