raisedbynarcissists,fqwhnrt,t3_gky9ck,1589704769.0,I can say I had to raise myself. My mom wasn't the best and my dad tried to do what he could when he could. My mom never taught me anything and expected me to know. Sometimes I felt like I was just brought into this world and has to figure everything out on my own. But as I grew older I learned that wasn't how things were actually supposed to be. Your parents were supposed to teach you right from wrong not get mad at you for anything and everything you whether that's good or bad. My mom barely taught me the basics of living I had to so on my own. She never inforced any kind of good habits on me like brush my teeth. I know it's gross but things are way better now. My dad was the only one who actually taught me things and life lessons. For the most part though I had to teach myself everything when he wasn't there. I never looked at it this way but thinking about it now makes me see alot more things that made my mom more narc then anything.

NTA I understand this situation to well as I've been in something similar.

  My SIL and her 2 kids moved in with my fiance, me, and his family when times were hard for her. I really tired to get along with her because she was the only other girl in the house. We lived in a small apartment that all the rooms were taken so she had to sleep in the living room with her kids. After a couple months she was supposed to have found another place to stay but didn't even seem like she was trying. She's leave her kids with the family mostly me and go off to work and not get home till late around 12am.

 I didn't mind watching the kids at first but it started to get all the time and I love them they are family but their not my kids and not my full responsibility. I got upset at her and told her she needed to be home taking care of her kids. I knew her job was from 8 to 5 so I knew she was off alot and she was making good money she could have been out of our place in no time if she prioritized her money better but she spent it all on new make up and expensive handbags. 

Anyways she got upset after I told her that and lashes out at me for everything I did. How I talked to her kids that I was always in the room she demanded she sleep in which was our home office that had my PC and everyone in the houses computers they needed to be on. She got the room but it was only for around bedtime when she and the kids needed to sleep that was fair. She didn't treat it like that she assumed it was now her room. The room was always trashed she let her kids be messy with food and never cleaned any of it up. I had to do that. 

After about 6 months not having access to that room I decided I needed to be on my PC so I paved my way to my desk marked out an area that was my area put up signs and told the kids to not touch anything in that area. It was small but it was all I had besides my bedroom that had 3 feet of walking space barley that. She got upset at the signs teared them down and literally got in my face about it. I am horrible in situations where there is yelling and anything agressive in general. I shut down I close off myself and disassociate. I had a panic attack that night because of the things she said about me which weren't true and her yelling in my face about Evey little thing she could possibly blame me for and nit-pick at. No one in the family wanted to face her besides my fiance who wasn't home at the time. I told him about it and he got in her face about it. That was the end of the line for him and he wanted her gone so we started making threats we'll tell the landlord we had people who weren't on the lease stay there. Which could have possibly kicked everyone out but it was that bad of a situation. That made her kick in high gear and she started to find a place to move.

 We eventually moved out around the same time she moved out too. There was alot going on and we were looking for a place to move into to be more independent. We never told the landlord so no one was ever kicked out. We don't talk to her anymore I hate her so does my fiance. I just hope her kids are doing alright they were little boogurs but sweet kids none the less.

OP your definitely NTA. I'm glad you stood your ground. If they really want privacy they can go do whatever in their car or a motel. The can use their drive for privacy to get them out of the situation so they work just as harder to find a place to stay. It's really gross to think your sister possibly having sex on your bed. I'd stay firm and if they suggest it again and make a fight about it tell them to hit the road. They can't really be beggers in this situation. Due to whatever happened, I'm assuming they both lost their jobs due to this virus, they don't have room to beg. Lol see what I did there. Hope things work out well for you and they find anew place to stay. A situation like that can turn for the worse like it did for me I hope things don't go that far."

raisedbynarcissists,fqeaf2j,t3_gi7azi,1589304347.0,"I had a very similar experience with my mom and periods I thought my period. I had my first period at the age of 13 when I was living with my dad and my stepmom. My stepmom helped me with my period Because I didn't really know anything about it or how to deal with it she helped me through the first one I had and a couple more after that. I told my mom I started my period the next time I saw her and she went ballistic and got mad at me for not telling her sooner and got mad at my stepmom for taking a milestone away from her. 

Unrelated to my period but another milestone my mom got very upset over was me learning how to shave my legs. I had a friend who was a few years older than me and I drove over to her house quite often and her mom taught her how to shave her legs and she was shaving her legs one day while I was over and asked if I wanted to learn too. Of course I said yes and a couple years later when my mom got me my first shaving kit she asked if she could teach me how to shave. I dismissed her offer saying I already knew how my friend taught me. Mind you this was a couple years after I learned how to shave. She got so upset and was mad that another milestone was taken from her I understand where she's came from but she overreacted towards it which made it worse for me."
SeriousConversation,fq968ho,t3_ghcvfd,1589187046.0,"This is the first mother's day that I've actually dreaded. My mom was pretty abusive towards me. as I got older it got better and not so physical anymore but that switched to mental and emotional abuse and I've only just realized how it's effected me. And it's effected me greatly. Seeing this now has made me resent my mom where as before I knew she was a narcissist and just blamed all the abuse and the way she talked to me as that's just how she is I can't change it so I'll have to deal with it. I don't live with her anymore and hardly ever talk to her. I've given up on trying to create any kind of relationship with her because she just doesn't try and it's gotten to the point I don't care if she talks to me or not. There's no point if your own mother doesn't want to talk to you barely because you decided to leave the best. That's the biggest reason she still has issues with me is because I moved out when I was 18.

Anyways this was the first mother's day I didn't really appreciate her. I used to write FB post about her and say how great of a mom she was and how hard she tried which was true raising kids is no joke but she was far from being the best. I was blinded before and thought she was the best she could be but I was very wrong and even though she did try to be somewhat of a good mom in her own way it still wasn't right most of the time 

I started hating all the post I've seen today because they are all about great moms who have been there for their kids through thick and thin and didn't blame then for things they never did. It made me so jealous of the kids who have those kinds of moms or even parents. I know I'll never get that and it's so frustrating because I feel like I won't ever have an actual mom. I think from now on u til I have kids mother's day is just going to be another reminder of the abuse she gave me and how I will never get the mom I deserve."

AmItheAsshole,fpcihkf,t3_gcj097,1588501765.0,"I can't understand why she's so upset over receiving alcohol it's not like you knew she didn't drink. There doesn't seem to be a reason she should be so upset to cry over it unless she was previously an alcoholic and is now sober making it seem like you ment it in a wrong way when it was a genuine gift not an insult. I wouldn't send the flowers but as someone suggested sending a card full of glitter would be a better option. It's not a direct fuck you but close enough and makes it more difficult for them to clean up giving them a real punishment to deal with. 

I'd say ESH. It sounds like she doesn't like you and got upset over such a small thing that shouldn't be significant and says some pretty mean things about you which is wrong but you wouldn't be in right either to send anything to her just because she doesn't like you and says mean things. You may not like her either but by sending something mean to her is stooping to her level which doesn't make you look good or the bigger person and you lose. Which could also cause more problems between you and your father. By doing nothing and having her act like a child for you doing something genuine out the pureness of your heart makes her look bad and you the bigger person. Its a win for you because your not being immature and a loose for her because she's just childish for throwing a fit.

 If you really want to do something I'd tell them you genuinely didn't know and give an apology with the card I mentioned above as well as in that card a congrats on the engagement so it doesn't seem like your being a total bitch. congratulating them in the card while also saying sorry combined with the mess of the glitter everywhere disguises the fuck you while seeming like your being nice and genuine."

I understand that feeling of wanting love from then so we'll it hurts. I still talk with my mom every now and then but it doesn't stop the scar she made over many years of neglect from hurting. I would not talk to any of your family. It hurts to think this but they will never love you the way you want them to. I'm not saying that to be mean it's just the truth. You either completely stop talking to them and heal from the hurt they have caused by realizing they won't love you the way you need or you continue to talk to them and continue v getting hurt more and more until you become numb and unstable.

I understand exactly how your feeling because I've been through those feelings too. I had to move away from my family and never talk to them for long periods of see them for long. I still remember the fact that my mom probably won't love me and support me like I want and need her to. It's not something she can do. It's depressing to feel that and realize how fucked up it is but there is nothing that can be done about it so I choose to go on with my life and live without her. It is totally possible and will make your life better. Focus on you and your boyfriend. Make a home where you will love your future children if you desire to have any. Things will look up so please don't be in bed for long. Get up and hug your bf because he's what matters the most he will support you and love you unlike anyone can and thats all that really matters.

AmItheAsshole,fotusfo,t3_g9f7dz,1588066871.0,YTA I don't even have to say allot because I agree with all the comments here. Your parent and a partner to your wife just because you work and are tired after you get home doesn't mean you don't have responsibilities you don't have to do. My fiance and I work as a team he works I stay home. A majority of the time I do the household chores but he helps out on his days off and when he can. We don't have kids yet so that's not on the list but I can only imagine how stressful it is for her to keep up with everything she has to do while taking care of kids and working from home. Your an adult and your married. With marriage come responsibilities and looking after your partner in bad and good times. Your the asshole because you havent looked at it from her perspective and see why she's so frustrated and wants a divorce. If she mentioned divorce before this isn't the first time you have acted like this to have her consider this. I'd say you better change the way you act and feel if you want to keep your family together otherwise you can kiss them goodbye because it doesn't seem like she will stay any longer and put up with your bullshit. My advice. Look at it from her perspective see why she's angry and take action to fix it. Be a good life partner for her and someone she can depend on when she's tired because God knows she is fed up and tired with being the only one holding up the foundation of the home.

I also have little to no sensitivity in my nipples unless I'm close to my period it would be amazing if I could get more sensitive because of this.

UnsentLetters,for83dn,t3_g8ymj8,1588007775.0,I feel this on a hard personal level. I too have an autistic brother and may very well be autistic myself. I hated how my mom would always treat him better then me. She'd abuse me and treated me like crap while coddling my brother and giving him everything he wanted because he had complications when he was born and was in and out of the hospital and because he has autism. To this day it's still the same and I don't talk to my brother often. I almost have always resented him because of how much better he was treated. I haven't tried to understand him much but have been wanting to lately. Things are still the same so idk if I'll be able to learn how he is and he never send to want to talk to me anyways no matter how hard I try. It's difficult. I fully understand how you've felt though because Ive felt and acted the exact same towards my brother.

I also have this fantasy and have acted on it in a way and it went horribly wrong. So bad that I hate thinking about what happened. I still have daydreams about my fiance going at it with another girl while I watch but the feelings I had after the acts were done take over and I no long get aroused by the thought of that. My emotions of feeling like it's wrong for him to touch another girl and that it's basically cheating in my mind even though im right there somewhat ok with it, those emotions take over when I think about it and it makes me feel disgusted by it before I get anymore turned on. Though the fantasy is not completely gone those feeling block any sort of arousals I may get from it.

I focus on the negatives subconsciously because of how traumatizing my experience was. In the moment when the sex was happening it was hot and I enjoyed it alot more then I thought possible. After everything happened and I was seeing more clearly I had a couple mental break downs because I couldn't handle the fact my fiance just had sex with another woman besides me. His first and only and having that aspect of being his only and another girl touched him made it worse. Which caused more conflict then I'd like to admit between my fiance and I.

Paranormal,fnbz4en,t3_g0r50i,1586825233.0,"I had a similar experience but with my dog. She was old and passed one night and I had found her lying in the kitchen away from our bedrooms where she would always lay. I had a strong feeling something was wrong with her before bed and told my mom but she dismissed it. I got up to get a drink and found her cold and limp on the kitchen floor. It seemed like she passed in her sleep. We were all shocked we had her for 10 years and it was heart breaking to see her like that let alone me being the one to find her dead. 

That night I had a very vivid dream where I was staying in this white tunnel and pepper my dog was there. She was running around panting enjoying her self then came up to me nudged on my leg. She gave me a kiss and walked off into the end of the tunnel. I tried going near her but the faster I walked the farther the tunnel stretched. I woke up the next morning crying and still shocked. I believe that was her saying goodbye and forgiving me for not helping her and treating her better. 

I miss her alot and think about her all the time. I know she's happy now. In my dream she had lost alot of weight and was able to move around like she did when she was a pup. I'm glad she said goodbye. 

The same also happen for my old cat tiger. I had a dream of him cuddling at my head on the bed where he always loved to stay and giving me a nudges and kisses.

I'm looking forward to have them peirced because I'm also pretty self conscious about them. I have bigger boobs but they sag so it makes me feel insecure about them sometimes when I'm naked. I think adding peircings to them will help me like them more and also give me more sensitivity.

raisedbynarcissists,fn6w67p,t3_fzt128,1586708533.0,"Reading this gave me flash backs to the night I left. Im sorry if it's long tldr at the end.

I had just turned 18 at the time and wanted to change schools because if I didn't I would have to be in school for another 2 years just to make up credits and graduate. Which is secretly what my mom wanted so she could get more money put of me from government payments.

I had a boyfriend at the time now fiance who came over alot and lived a great deal away from me. We would see each other about every weekend or so. So one time I went over to his house for the weekend and he told me about this online school he attended and recommend it to me. I was 18 so I was legally able to enroll into the school but couldn't be enrolled in 2 schools at the same time. So I would have to unenroll myself from my other school which proved to be difficult because the school denyed me unenrollment because my mom had to sign off on it. Which was bullshit because I knew the law and that was completely wrong I can legally unenroll myself from a school after I turn 18 which I was waiting for. 

So my mom finds out because the school called her and she came down to the school I never saw her because I was hiding in the back of the school because my anxiety and stress trying to get away from that school and home made me so upset I was shaking. My mom also had complete control over my phone so I couldn't contact my fiance during school unless I had internet. 

I came home that day and acted like nothing happened and went to my room and passed out from the stress for a couple hours. I locked my door and forgot about it and a couple hours later my mom came banging on the door screaming to let her in or else she'd take the door off its hinges. I opened it and she immediately asked "" Do you have anything to tell me?"" I looked at her confused in a daze from just waking up and shocked at how upset she was for no reason. I told her ""no I don't know what your talking about I just woke up what's going on?"" She didn't say anything and just stomped off. I shut my door got my phone and tried to message my fiance but the internet wasn't working and neither was my phone service. I got the house phone and the line was cut and I was freaking out because I couldn't call my fiance and my mom just started freaking out I figure she unplugged the phone and turned off the internet from me and that's when I knew things were going to get hectic.

My mom loves to blast music when she's hurt and upset and doesn't care how loud it is. So I'm in my room and she is blasting music in the living room and I go out there to see what she's doing and it's pitch black dark (mind you this was around 10-11pm ) so I turn on the lamp and she's laying on the couch curled into a ball crying. She looks up at me with the darkest eyes I've ever seen (my mom has blue eyes they were pretty dark not blue at that moment) and the most anger I've ever felt towards me. She tells me ""turn it off!"" In the most low voice with harsh undertones I've ever heard from her. i ask her what's wrong and she just repeats what she said a couple times while I ask her why she blasting music. At this point I'm scared, terrified so I turn the light off and run to my room. I lock my door grab my Bible because I'm sure what I just saw wasn't my mom but a demon. I pray the hardest I've ever prayed and I'm not that big of a religious person though I consider myself Christian. I can say God helped me and kept me safe that night. 

An hour goes by and I'm crying my eyes out because I'm scared my mom is going to hurt me again though she hasn't in a couple years. I have no way to contact to the outside world so I'm stuck to the confines of my room. I start to hear glass shattering and finally get the courage to go see what it was after it stops. I go out or the living room and don't see my mom but see all the portraits my mom had on the wall of me just me not brother just me all of them thrown on the ground and broken. I'm shocked and even more scared because that's a sign I could end up getting hurt. If she did that to my pictures then imagine what she would do if she saw me. I was scared and knew I needed to get help to get out of there. 

Thankfully my mom wasn't anywhere to be found. Stupidly I looked around for her and found her out front in the yard just sitting there. I asked her what was wrong and if she wanted to talk but all she said was to leave her alone so I did. I had no idea and still don't know what drove her to insanity that day. It could possibly be me trying to get into another school and not telling her and going against her wishes. It could be the fact that I was trying to move away and didn't tell her. I will never know. 

At this point I go back inside and try to gather my thoughts about what to do. I was in a fight or flight mode and my anxiety was raging. I couldn't contact anybody it was 12 almost 1am at night so no one in my small neighborhood was awake. I didn't have anyone to go to besides my ex best friend down the street so I decided to ""go take a walk"" after my mom got back inside. She got doped up on Xanax because of her anxiety through the situation I know this because she takes showers to calm down from it and finally went inside to shower and blast more music. 

So I ""take my walk"" really fast speeding out of the house so she doesn't notice and try to go to my friend's. We weren't on good terms but she was the only person I knew could help. I knocked on there door but got no answer and I wasn't surprised because it was late. My other option was a fire station in my neighborhood. I treaded down there and banged on the door and they let me use there phone to call my fiance and called the police for me. I talked with my fiance and told him what was wrong and he was worried because he couldn't contact me. Him and his dad immediately drove 40 mins to me to come pick me up at a gas station in my neighborhood. The cop took me back to my place and I got as much stuff as I could and my cat and waited at the gas station. My mom didn't even know i left until she finally got her shit together the next morning. My fiance picked me up and I moved in with him and his family. That was the best decision I have ever made to get away from there. 

After all that she kept calling my fiance's house harassing me calling me disgusting names and threatened to call the cops on me for stealing my phone back from her and other things I don't want to think about. Which she did and I gave the phone back. I've had LC with her since on and off for 3 years now and things have gotten better but I honestly don't think i can ever love her again and care for her. She's done way to much to me in my childhood I can't forget.

If you got this far thank you for reading my comment. Sorry if this is like a whole other post but OP's post made me think heavily of my experience so I wanted to share thank you for reading if you did.

Tldr: mom started acting crazy smashing pics of me cutting the phone line and cutting off internet when I wouldn't tell her I wanted to change my school on my own after I turned 18 which I had the authority too. She made a scene and I got terrified thinking a demon possessed her and ""escaped"" called the police and my then boyfriend  now fiance drove 40 mins to pick me up at 1am. 

P.S. weeks prior to me trying to unenroll from my school I showed my mom documents that I enrolled in another school because she confronted me about it and I didn't want to hide anything. At the time I was staying at my fiance's home for the weekend so I sent her pics of the documents and she denyed it. Like I was lying even though I had proof. she was so in her head that she thought it was impossible for me to unenroll myself from school and enroll into another yet having proof I did and showing the law that I could. I was also ""plotting"" as my mom likes to call it to move in with him and she no longer wanted me around him. That weekend I couldn't go home because 1 I didn't want to and 2 because his dad was out state and couldn't drive me home and my mom couldn't pick up be ause she was to lazy to drive down to get me and didn't want to waste gas but in the end she did anyways cuz she got fed up about it. Then a week later all that shit happened."
RandomKindness,fn6mwzv,t3_fzwwqw,1586703115.0,With everything going on with yourself you are such a  kind soul to be giving something like this out. I'm struggling myself with barely scraping by in the bills and rent to barely get food for my fiance and i. It's tough times already and this virus and quarantine really don't help much. I hope you pick someone who really needs god bless youüòä
rant,fn2s1e9,t3_fywxbl,1586600998.0,"I agree with most of what you said. My step cousin put out a story on insta the other day of her literally balling her eyes out because she couldn't go see her friends. I think that's a little too much tbh. 

And all these memes about quarantine are getting repetitive and annoying. Everyone complains about how much they hate going to work and all they want is to stay home but once they get to stay home they get stir crazy. I understand, people get on a schedule and habits form so their used to being outside and once they can't it feels like you can't shake the anxiety of staying home. I get that I stay home basically all the time and my life hasn't changed much from this quarantine but even I get that way and I consider myself an introvert. But it gets to the point when you can complain to much and it just sounds like whining. No one likes whining. Have you ever heard a kid screaming and crying because something didn't go their way? Well most adults right now are starting to sound like that and it's getting annoying."
AmItheAsshole,fn13e70,t1_fn0rrq4,1586553991.0,Because I'm usually not like that and like to keep myself Clean and feeling fresh. I see that creppying up on me I know I've hit a low point again
AmItheAsshole,fn0imoc,t1_fmzdrxj,1586542626.0,I suffer from depression and I can say that this is entirely true. there are days that I don't end up taking care of myself for a couple days. That's when I know I'm hitting a low point in my depression. even though I am happy and positive doing lots of things I am still depressed because I am not doing the basic needs I need to do. I am not eating I am not cleaning myself I am not taking care of my hair I'm not getting the basic necessities for life that is when I know I am in a low bout of depression this is a very real thing and I'd suggest OP gets help for his SO
BDSMcommunity,fmxlj5x,t1_fmxj3km,1586467244.0,"I'm glad I could help. I go through the same feelings you described. I've learned way to help myself be better with my thoughts though I'm still learning and growing. It's difficult on some day but when you have someone there who supports you it's even easier. 

It felt the same for me coming out to my fiance about my kitten side. I never actually knew it was a thing for me until this year but always wore ears and tails. I'd catch myself acting cat like but everyone thought it was weird so I suppressed it for a long time. Then I learn it was a kink and sexual things, it just exploded from there and I wanted to share it with my fiance. I was so scared to tell him because I thought he would think I was weird for liking such a thing and that it was wrong and just creepy for wanting to wear a bushy tail, realistic like cars ears, and collar all the time. He was extremely supportive and encouraged it because he thought it was cute and sexy which made me feel really great.

 Every now and then I still go back on thinking he doesn't like it and finds it weird even though he's done and said nothing that proves that. It's just and issue I need to work on myself and with him and he understands. He's been so giving and supportive of since the day I met him. It's really great to be able to be open without feeling judgement.

The way it sounds doesn't seem like your fiance dislikes its. He's open to it and that's what matters. Ask him about what he likes about it and finds enjoyable and channel those things more if you can. It will make it more positive for him and also for you. It will break that cycle of linking it to abuse too.

 Always remember to always think of your partner while going about things that they are easing into. I speak from experience and it was the worst thing I've ever done. I only thought about myself and how I would feel and what I wanted. I didn't think about how what I was wanting and needing affected my partner. Now I realize that things are alot better and way more fun."
BDSMcommunity,fmxik88,t1_fmwunze,1586465653.0,"I can understand how you feel entirely. I'm into pet play and being a sub and my fiance is ok with me being a kitten and enjoys it. I've gotten way into my head recently and made it seem like he didn't like it to me because of some insignificant things he said. We talked and worked things through and now I'm coming to terms with my feelings and learning I need to realize what we both want from both perspectives. We are easing back into kitten play and I can tell now he's into our play times. 

Your SO seems open to it which is great that the first step to incorporating it again. I'd take it slow and be aware of his reactions to you being a little to gage if he is actually enjoying it to. Have your mind Go off his reactions so you don't get caught up in your head about him not liking it. This technique is a hit and miss because it depend on how the other person is feeling so if they are not liking it you might feel more sad about that and get more into your head on the other hand if they do like it and you see that you can start to feel more comfortable. 

I'm not sure if I'm making sense at all but this is how I e worked things out with similar problems. I've always felt that my kitten play kink wasn't sexy or accepted by my fiance when it actually was and I just to self conscious about it so I didn't want to do it anymore until he made sure I knew he didn't mind it. That and being a submissive for him has been difficult due to conflicting feelings from both of us. It's gonna take time. Show you SO the things you like about littlespace and reassure them your doing this of your own will because it's something you like and feel is a deep part of you. Eventually they will come to accept it when seeing how much it makes you happy and see how it's not hurting you anymore"
raisedbynarcissists,fms35bz,t3_fwy9ty,1586345012.0,"Wow being hit with a .308 hollow point at such close range..  that's insane I'm surprised your even alive. I mean you did die maybe twice but to even come back at all is amazing. There's definitely a reason your ment to be alive. Try to get out of there as fast as you can your definitely not safe there at all. Your family doesnt seem to sympathize with you for the situation they put you in. That's really sucks and is shitty on their part. It's crazy how insensitive, cold, and abusive people can be to their family."
CasualConversation,fmo770l,t1_fmo6gk4,1586247931.0,"I understand the small living space too I was homeless for a couple months when I was a teen. We had to stay with relatives and only had a small trailer that fit me my mom my brother and my mom's friend. I had to sleep on the living room floor with my brother but we would alternate from the bed in the back with mom to the floor every other night. It was hell for me. And with that many people living in such a small space it always got cluttered which didn't make my depression any better back then. 

I moved in with my fiance a couple years later and had the same problem with so little room living in a small 4 bed apartment with 6 people. I'd always get overwhelmed because I had about 3 feet of walking space in my bedroom my fiance and I shared. I was never able to keep it clean which made me spiral into a deep depression most of the time. 

Things are looking up now that we have our own place and lots more space. Yet somehow we still have alot of things. I'm surprised this whole apartment was able to fit in a 10 x 9 room."

CasualConversation,fmo60yo,t1_fmo5qeu,1586246678.0,Thank you. I hope you can push through and get those clothes done. Doing laundry is the one thing I dread the most and tend to procrastinate on them until I just can't look at it anymore. I've watched Marie kondo show on Netflix and it's so informational and helpful. I can now fit many pair of pants in one drawer due to her way of folding. I've also gotten rid of alot of unnecessary clothes I never really wore. If you have time and neflix definitely watch it it's a great show and Marie is such a sweetheart.
CasualConversation,fmo5slh,t1_fmo51cv,1586246429.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I tend to do the same thing when I get on a good roll. Like today I had to move a night stand that was in my closet to be my new bedside table. I got it a year ago and hadn't fully cleaned it. So when I got it set up I was like you know this is kinda dirty let me wipe it down. 30 mins later I wiped all the from that was stuck in the edges now it looks and feels alot better. 

It happened again when after dinner I didn't wipe the counters down and I was just going to leave it till morning but as I was putting dishes in the dishwasher I was like you know it's just a little bit of stuff let me wipe it up. Then I headed to bed but saw my cat box Ive been meaning to scoop for a day now and was like that really needs to be done let me do it quick before bed. 

Everything I did today just ended up leading to a other. I felt like I didn't have anything weighting me down so I just went with it. I initially just wanted to put the clothes away today but ended up cleaning my whole room. It's not a bad thing to keep finding things to do but if you never sit down and break you'll end up hurt. I have a shoulder problem and lower back pain so when I do to much those tend to act up. With my back I have to make sure I use my core when bending over otherwise pain shoots right up my back and I'm left stuck bent over. It sucks. Luckily today that didn't happen and my shoulder just bothered me. 

I got alot done and that's all that matters. I didn't touch the bathroom but like you to I'll probably hit that another day. Tomorrow I got to take out all the trash and then I can relax for the rest of the day and finally only focus on working on my PC."

Keep it up and look forward to that bright future of yours. Whether you see it or not there are always going to be people who support you. Even a complete stranger like myself.

Unfortunately I can't give you advice because I'm in need of it to. The reason why I'm lurking around this sub reddit.

Wear some clothes you know you felt good in and revamp your confidence. And fake it till you make it if it's not all the way there yet. I have pretty low self-esteem and it's often difficult for me to love myself. So these are the things I do to help and can it really does. 

Also dump the guy. Who cares what he thinks if he's making you feel bad about yourself then he doesn't like you to begin with. His behavior sounds like manipulator behavior and those kinds of people are horrible. Run as far away from him as you can."
BDSMAdvice,fmbrm8o,t3_fuaa6h,1585931938.0,"I didn't know this was a feeling until you described it. I've been feeling this way for a while and didn't even realize it. 

My fiance isn't to into BDSM. TBH he doesn't like certain things about it and can't understand the Dom mindset. So he's not able to or even want to give me tasks and punishments and rewards. Though he likes kitten play but it doesn't go any farther then me just acting like a cat. It's been very frustrating for the majority of our relationship but we make do and still have fun. 

As of late though I've been feeling extremely empty due to not having those needs met. It's putting a bit of a toll on me emotionally and making me question my relationship. I really don't want to end it but I know nothing will change and he's not the way I want him to be. I don't have any plans to end it but talking to him about it seems hopeless. And I honestly don't know how to deal with these feelings."
unpopularopinion,fm75g9e,t3_ftbv6g,1585813937.0,"This is very similar to me. Back when l was 13 I started smoking and I smoked everyday. The stuff I was getting was from a private seller who grew from his home. That was and has ever been the only thing that I can actually take. A couple years later I moved in with my mom after a while and still wanted to smoke but couldn't get any from that guy anymore. So I went to outside sources. Everything I smoked always gave me extreme anxiety attacks. After about 3 more tires trying to smoke I gave up entirely. With in the last year I've been more open to it again because my fiance wanted to try it. I've still had no luck with it and don't plan on doing anything with again. I've thought about a vape pen with mainly cbd but I'm to afraid to even try anything now. My anxiety is through the roof that I'll have anxiety so I've just stay away from it. 

My issues where very similar though and I noticed getting anxious worse and worse the closer I got to the full on panic attack that made me stop smoking. Maybe the stuff I was getting before was way better but all I know is now if I try to smoke anything at all I'll be sobbing in the shower trying to sober up. It's just not worth it to me. 

I used to have a really open mindset about it. And  want to smoke because it was fun and It'd be fun to do it with my fiance again until I find something i can handle and where to get it"
unpopularopinion,fm74w1u,t1_fm6h3ua,1585813350.0,This sounds like a girl I once knew. She would constantly smoke and literally couldn't live without it. She'd smoke a bowl and then play some games having the same mindset you described. If she didn't smoke for more then an 1hour after her last high wore off she would get extreme anxiety. She'd get so blazed out that half the time she fell asleep. It was insane I'd never seen someone smoke that much and rely on it that much.
Advice,fm3u9nb,t1_fm3tfwv,1585737252.0,"We both get enjoyment from what we do with kitten play. It's not like he doesn't get 0 enjoyment out of it I make sure of that. I don't even think he sees me being a kitten and him as my owner being a dom sub thing but when it goes outside of that he says he doesn't get what people can find enjoyable about being a dom and acts like the Dom's get nothing in return.

When we talked he was never that clear and wasn't a very long talk either. More like a comment on a tik tok he expressed. 

It matters alot to me and he knows that and has been trying for me and I'm so happy and thankful he does. Not all the time is he Dom like and that's ok because not all the time am I Sub like. We've talked before about that also as it used to be an issue and from time to time still is. As you said I don't think it will ever be good enough for me unless he all of the sudden gets more interest in it and wants to learn more. But I love him. I don't want to be with anyone else but him and can't see myself that way either. So moving on isn't an option. 

Kitten play was kind of a middle ground for us. It wasn't to into it and felt like it gave us more room to explore and not define things as such like BDSM. It was a compromise. I got a head of myself and wanted more and tried to gradually ease into it. I got so excited finding out a new part of me and probably went to fast without realizing it."

That's pretty gross. It is a normal reaction especially with this whole virus thing going on. But I'd doubt that one little thing is actually OCD she's just being cautious. Because of misinformation people associate cleanliness with OCD and that's where it miss translated as just being neat and nothing more. People really don't understand the severity of it.

Even though I've been diagnosed it's not my main mental illness and my current doc didn't think I have it although my last and multiple others said I do. It's gotten worse as I'm getting older too. More and more habits arise and I'm afraid it will keep getting worse. As for now though im just happy others understand what I go through too. It almost empowers me.

One of the main things that has hit me is there have been way more sirens near my home making me feel on edge. I live on the far edgy of town and don't normally here sirens at all. So this has worried me and made me feel uneasy. I started to feel like it getting really serious when there was 2 death just down the street from me. It made me realize just how close this is to me and how bad it's going to get.
unpopularopinion,fl6l8ne,t1_fl6br51,1584874018.0,I am someone with multiple disorders and have been to many therapist and psychiatrist and I am very happy to hear there is someone like you in the field. I've had not to many good outcomes with therapist and psychiatrist but you sound like a very good doc. Thank you for spreading the right info on people with these disorders
depression,fkwxt5c,t3_fl010g,1584610628.0,I was just wanting to start therapy to and now I have to wait until this all blows over. Hopefully soon things will get back to normal. I really need therapy and also to go back to the dentist.
raisedbynarcissists,fkqa63o,t3_fjv9p7,1584437304.0,Lately I'm having second thoughts on having children because of parenting like this. I grew up with Narc parents my mom mostly. I didn't find out until recently that they were and how they treated me wasn't necessarily normal like I thought it was. I see how parents nowadays treat there children. It makes me realize I won't know how to treat my children because I wasn't raised in an environment that was healthy so I don't know what's healthy. There is this mom on tik tok that tells stories of how she handles situations with her kids and how to lift them up and be a good parent. It's made me dout myself because I see how I was never treated in a normal family household so I have trouble figuring out what would be good for them. I don't want to end up hurting my children like my parents did to me. So I've been stepping back and asking myself: Do I really want kids? I know I do in my heart and I know I can learn what is better for them. But when the right foundation of my childhood isn't strong and hardly there it becomes unclear to me if I can actually handle it
raisedbynarcissists,fkp8h05,t1_fkj3r9l,1584404181.0,"My dad regrets never doing anything and he hated how my mother treated me. To this day she won't accept that it was abuse and makes me feel crazy for thinking it was. Thankfully I no longer live with her so I don't have to deal with it as much. When I was younger my parents would fight alot and I'd get in the middle of it because I just hated it. It wasn't my place or a place for a child at all to step into and it was alot to handle at a young age but I felt it matured me. My mom never wanted to rely on me emotionally because her mom did so and she basicallyhad to be the parent to her mom. She never let that happen to me which helped me growing up. That was probably the only good thing she ever did. 

As for the fights going to bed I should have listened and there definitely was a better way for everything to go well. Even my mom admits to that but that's as best I'll get from her. I never did get to spend time with my dad alot so that was the only time I could but my dad could have handled that situation alot better and compromised by making time for me in the day. Everything was messed up at the time life got the best of everyone and drug certainly didn't help. It happened and I haven't been able to go to therapy for it yet. The last time I was in therapy was when all of this was happening and my parents divorced. Alot of trama followed after therapy so I definitely need to go back and sort things out within myself.

I feel like my childhood wasn't the best but it wasn't bad either. I went through a lot and actually never told anyone about it. Anyone I did tell, even my therapist, told me that everything I had experiences was not abuse or some times even in my head. It made me feel alone so joining this sub and commenting on things that happened to me just for it to be validated makes me feel so much better."
raisedbynarcissists,fkp6ync,t1_fkmgo25,1584403192.0,I know full well I won't get it but I can dream. She's always going to be like that even after pointing it out there really no getting around it. It's almost like talking to a brick wall.
Anxiety,fkj1ot2,t3_fimwvj,1584233939.0,Tbh I e been falling asleep just fine if not better since all this. I have been having bad dreams though so that doesn't always helps. I've also got back on a regular schedule of sleep after insomnia took over my life for a bit.
raisedbynarcissists,fkj0xkb,t1_fkj0bqe,1584233382.0,Haha thanks for the hugs. It was a long time ago it happened so I'm somewhat ok now. It was definitely frustrating I'd kick and scream and flail my arms. Only thing I really want from all that is a confession from my mom saying it was abuse and was definitely wrong.
raisedbynarcissists,fkj06m6,t3_fimhfs,1584232837.0,"This is sad. It's sad because the end bit is extremely relatable. 

When I was 8-13 I wouldn't always go to bed or do my homework. My mom and dad were still together at the time and I always loved hanging out with my dad in his man cave. We'd talk and have a good time. Because he either worked all day or slept all day because he had night shifts I would stay up with him as long as I could. I wanted time with him as much as I could because I never got to really see him.

My mom did not like this at all she hated that I didn't listen to her to go to bed when told. She hated how I loved my dad and got along better with him alot more then her and she definitely showed her jealously and anger. 

My dad never really pushed for me to go to bed because he wanted to spend time with me too. When my mom would tell me to go bed and I didn't listen she'd count down from 5 and if I didn't get up she would grab a chunky of my hair and pull me by my hair to my bed. I of course cried out for my dad but this became a normal thing that happened and no one did anything. They always bowed their heads and ignore my screams. It got to the point wear my mom wanted to video tape me having my tantrums and replay it back to me later and show her friends and the therapist. Imagine how that feels it was humiliating to me I still havent resolved my feelings over that. I struggled with her every night. She'd do all that again and then I'd finally get away from her and out of my bedroom back to my dad. Dad told me I needed to go to bed but I was stubborn and didn't want to because I missed him. 

Again she would find me pull me by my hair to my room dragging me on the floor or making me trip over myself so my hair didn't get ripped out of my head. If I struggled more she would close my door and shove me down on the bed and lay with me. I'd get multiple times and she just shove me down again. She'd put her arms and legs over my body so I was essentially strapped to my bed by her. My mom wasn't a skinny person she was pretty big so even if I wanted to push her off I couldn't trust me I tried. It would get to the point where I would fight back so much I'd get extremely tired and just pass out. I'd also scream for her to get off me and for my dad but my mom would cover my mouth. I'd play like I was asleep so she would leave and after she left I'd cry myself to sleep because of how much she was hurting me physically and emotionally. My mom the person who was supposed to love me unconditionally and protect me was doing all of this to me. I felt like she didn't love me as much as she loved my brother and just hated me. Every night for about 3 or 4 years this happened and each night getting worse. Granted it probably all wasn't my moms fault because I could have just gone to bed normally but I never got to see my dad and I needed all the time I could get with him because when he wasn't there my life was a living hell with my mom.

Every time this topic gets brought up she denies she ever abused me and says ""it was all discipline what else was supposed to do you would always run away from me your hair was the only thing I could grab ahold of"". We still talk but it's not alot and I still can't handle her. After my parents divorced my dad moved and left me with my mom our relationship eventually got better but she took a more mental turn to the abuse which I'm still struggling with today. 

Sorry if this was long if you read it all thank you. This reminded me of my bed time times lol. I wish my mom could have been more like that I know my dad was."
AmItheAsshole,fjztxoi,t3_ffgwib,1583729283.0,"NAH I do think she's going a little over board. You don't need an excessive amount of TP and PT. As for the food it doesn't hurt to have some kind of preparation for anything. 

My fiance isn't one of those major preppers but he's prepping just in case. It's really alot of money and we won't eat half the things we bought because we are on a diet until SHTF (shit hits the fan). It's really not a bad thing to do and it's always good to be prepared. Your wife is doing it the wrong way though. She has the right idea but just to much of it. A shit ton of beans is ok but you'll get sick of it. Getting a bunch of variety of canned goods would be better. 

I don't think your the asshole and neither is she. She isn't doing it right by any means and only panic buying with is the worst kind. Your not totally in the wrong with your feelings about the prepping but should understand where she's coming from. 

I get pretty upset with my fiance when we go out and buy more things for prepping and it's understandable and he's doing it a good way instead of just panic buying. Regardless it's still irritating so I understand where your coming from."
Scary,fjz0htb,t3_ffb4b0,1583708582.0,This is exactly why I don't swim in lakes or Rivers I can't fully see through.
AmItheAsshole,fjyz2y7,t3_ffd129,1583707684.0,"YTA a major one at that. I really hope you take all these comments and learn from it. Your definitely the asshole here and you need to change your thought process if you want a happy healthy relationship later on. If you keep doing things like this to your girl she will leave you. Im surprised she hasn't.

I listen to Kpop and fan girl over alot of groups so I know how she must have felt and it must have been amazing for her to meet her idols. Keep that in mind and lets turn this situation around towards you. Let's say you want to share something you like with your girl, Like cars or games or whatever you like, and she isn't interested in it and even jokes hard at you for liking it and says some hurtful things about how it's stupid and doesn't make sense. How would you feel? You'd probably feel like shit right? Because someone you care for just trashed something you like and hold dear. That's most likely how she feels. And why she doesn't want to invite you to things like a concert because you won't have fun and she won't be able to enjoy herself without worrying that your bored and don't get it and judge her for things she likes. And don't buy tickets to a concert you probably won't enjoy leave those tickets open to actual fans.

Because I listen to Kpop and fan girl a bit my fiance makes side remarks and jokes about it and it's honestly very irritating and annoying and sometimes insensitive. I've had to bark at him a couple of times to knock it off. It's something I like the person I love shouldnt act or feel embarrassed by it. They should see how much I like it and appreciate it for making me so happy and maybe try to learn what makes me so happy about it. I stopped talking to my fiance about Kpop when he showed no interest in it and didn't care to talk about it. It sucks because I want to discuss something I like with him but he doesn't care. I could be the same towards him and the things he likes but that not what I want to do. I want to learn what makes him happy and love him even more for those things. Thankfully my fiance and I have alot of similar interests. You may not always like what she likes but try to understand why she likes it and not joke or belittle her for liking it. It causes issues for her and most likely makes her insecure about her interest.

I wish my fiance would take what I like more seriously and learn to enjoy it as much as I do even if it's just a little. I've talked with him and pointed out how his jokes about it are hurtful to me and I wish he would not joke about it. He didn't really understand what I was getting upset over but has since stopped joking about it so much. Every now and then he'll throw in a small joke when he knows it's alright but he still respects me enough to not go further.

This isn't just about you not liking the group. It's about how you embarrassed her by making jokes in front of her friends saying how embarrassed you were because of her. You don't f@#$ing say that to or about your SO in any situation. Your being so insensitive to her and don't even care about how she feels. You need to think before you speak and learn what will hurt others. Obviously you don't think your the asshole and need some serious self reflection to better yourself for your girl. If you still think it's stupid and belittle her for liking something you can't understand then leave her she deserves better. Harsh words I know and I don't like being mean but these are thing that need to be said."
AmItheAsshole,fjv8c0u,t3_fexya3,1583624206.0,"NTA it's your birthday and you specifically requested she bring a sweet cake. There is no shame in having sweets every now and then. If she has a specific lifestyle she wants to cater to then She simply doesn't need to eat the regular cake you want. She's being insensitive to you on your birthday with a normal birthday request. To me she sounds like shes selfish and doesn't really care about the health of your family and more so about her not having to look at a regular cake and be tempted. 

I'm on the keto diet and I can't have any sweets and am restricted on carbs so alot of foods that would normally be eaten in a family household with others who aren't on the diet I can't have. I've learned to live with and not be as tempted. It's something choose. I can't make form to my needs. It's something you love with when you have a healthier lifestyle.

If your sister"
depression,fjpw5xr,t3_fem8tv,1583562100.0,I'm so proud of you for getting up and showering. I know all to well how dreadful that is when depressed. Look at this as a great accomplishment and move forward positively.
Advice,fjjmsgh,t1_fji45uc,1583403916.0,Also M using the way you are against you is a sign of not being a true dominant. No true dominant would do that. That's just plain abuse using the thing you like. I've been through that to so I'm all to familiar with it.
Advice,fjjmn8p,t1_fji45uc,1583403702.0,Ypu will definitely get through this it's a matter of time like I said. I'm so happy I could share my story and someone else gain from it. If you ever need anyone to talk to further who understands I'm here. Shoot me a message if you'd like and we can talk further in detail if your comfortable. I don't like putting to much on here but willing to share alot more if it will help you. It does get better and I'm evidence of that. You'll definitely one day find someone who will care for you the way you need it to it takes alot of time and patience and strength to get there but you will. I met my fiance a year or 2 after wheat happened and I can say I've never been happier with my life. Again I'm so glad I could help hearing you say that is worth every word I wrote. I wish the best for you cuz I know how it is and it's amazing to know your not alone too.
AskReddit,fjhe957,t3_fdbdik,1583346426.0,"Not my story but my fiances and partially mine. I'll try  make it short.

 Me and my fiance went to Walmart late one night to get some things for something I was baking. He got caught up in the fishing isle with his dad so I quickly went over to get what I needed. It was late no one was there so I was by myself. It was summer so I was wearing skirt a long one that went almost to the ground.

A Walmart employee walked behind me and I tried to make sure he went past. (Paranoia and anxiety I guess) I turn around to him putting his phone up my skirt with the flash on taking a picture. He shot up and looked terrified as I screamed at him asking what the hell he was doing. I always carry knife on me for these kind of instances and almost pulled it out right then and there but didn't want me being in the wrong to some how pop up. I was furious and scared I wanted to hurt The guy for doing something like that to me. But I didn't and The guy immediately ran to the back of the store and I ran to get my fiance and his dad.

 His dad searched high and low in the store for him and so did my fiance. My fiance didn't want to leave my side but he was visibly shaking from how much rage he was trying not to show. We found the guy and my fiance got very upset. He's able to keep his cool really well and didn't slip but I could tell he wanted to bash the guys face in and give him hell.  

Cops got called and they found nothing. With no evidence nothing could be done besides pressing charges but I was dealing with alot at the time with me moving away from family and drama I didn't want to add more to my plate so I didn't press charges. Since he was an employee there we tried calling corporate to get him fired but with no evidence they couldn't do anything. They just told us don't shop at that store anymore. The guy still works there and we don't shop there anymore. My fiance refuses to go to that store at all for anything even though it's closer because if he sees the guy at all it reminds him he wasn't there to protect me and that some tool advantage of me. I don't like going there but have on my own before and have seen him he recognizes me but just puts his head down while I stare him down. I hardly go there because it was a traumatizing experience for me. I'm sure if my fiance didn't hold his cool then that guy probably wouldn't be walking right now."
Advice,fjgg9vu,t3_fdat56,1583325687.0,"I wanna start by saying I'm sorry you had to go through all of that. I understand your view point and where your coming from about your ex. I've been through something so similar so I know how your feeling. 

I dated a guy back when I was 16. I only dated him for 3 months but I felt like he was the one. It was a long distance relationship so no physical abuse went on but I'm sure if he had the chance there would have been. He manipulated me same like they way your ex did and made me think I needed him and loved him and I couldn't do anything wrong to hurt him and had to be there for him. All the while he wasn't there for me and just made me feel worse most the time. He was what people call a false Domaint in the BDSM community. We did alot of stuff from that kind of community and that's where most of the abuse stemmed from for me. I don't want to go into detail let's just say he used a part of me against me and it messed me up for a while. Much like what happened to you with your abandonment issues. Which my ex also used that issue again me too. 

I believed and did everything he said and never questioned him. We ended up breaking up 3months after getting together. I was distraught. I wanted to be with him. I believed we were ment to be. I couldn't live without him in my mind. I tried talking with him to get back together but he blocked me on everything. I couldn't do without him and the pain was to great I started to go numb. I needed to feel something so I started to cut. It was the first time I had ever cut and I always told myself I would never do something like that. I had suicide thoughts and wanted nothing to do with life without him. Things got better with time for me and eventually I healed.

Sadly there's nothing you can do to immediately feel better. If you've been to therapy for years you know it takes time. It takes time for wounds to heal. Your going to be sad. Your going to feel angry. Your going to not feel like you can't go on. These are valid feelings. These are feelings you feel after you have gotten out of something you know didn't do you good. These feelings are a sign of healing. This is just the beginning and it will pass have patience.

 It's going to take time. After he left me I wanted to be dead so bad. I didn't think I could live without him and I was very wrong. It took a long time for me to heal and even now after 5 years I'm still healing. All I can say is ride it out. Find yourself. Find things you like to do, focus on those things. Put all your self into it. After a while you start to forget. You'll find a better reason for living. And those feelings will start to fade. Having family around also helps. My mom and I never had the best relationship (alot of abuse there too) but she was there for me when things where tough. She helped me through it and made me feel better on days I felt like I couldn't do anything. Reach out to others don't be afraid to ask for help and loving care from others. All you can do is focus on yourself and do what's good for you. 

I know how it feels and it will take a while before you feel completely ok. I'll admit every now and then I still find myself looking back to see how he's doing. I'm in a loving relationship now of 3 1/2 years. There shouldn't be a reason I still care about that man who hurt me right?  I think it's ok though. He's someone I held close to my heart and helped shape me to who i am today whether that be the good things or the bad things that happened. You loved him it's ok to still care just don't let that consume you again because your worth so much more then what he gave you. 

Therapy only helps to a certain degree. My advice is focus on you. Focus on your hobbies. What do you like to do? Ask yourself what you love about yourself. Be kind to yourself. Your healing and your doing your best. 

I hope I helped if even just a little. I probably went on and on. I saw alot of myself in your situation and wanted to do what I could to help. These are things that helped me grow from the madness hopefully they can help you to. Thing will get better with time you just need to have patience with yourself and trust your heart that you'll be ok. It took me a while to learn to trust my heart in the healing process. I know I didn't have a chance to make the hurt stop so I let it happen and pass and tried my best to look forward to a brighter day. I tried my hardest to stay positive. Like I said having family or friends helped that stick better. 

I pray you start to feel better and wish the best for you on your path to being better. I hope I helped in anyway. Stay strong and fight on! I'm rooting for you!"
SeriousConversation,fj9q0j5,t1_fj6ut94,1583156609.0,I am seeing a psychiatrist for my disorders and have just started new meds. I plan on going to a therapist in the future but have been holding off from it because of many bad experiences with them. It's a difficult task to find a therapist you click with and there's not many in my area that take my insurance so it's been a battle with therapist. I do see a psychiatrist so I do have some sort of help. Getting on the right meds have been hard ngl. I'm very sensitive to meds and sometimes they make matters worse. I'm still trying everything I can regardless.
SeriousConversation,fj9pjq5,t1_fj6pqju,1583156242.0,I've been through alot of rough patches and meds only make it worse sometimes but so far their helping as do my little fur babies. Hoping this next month will be a good one.
AmItheAsshole,fj6gd4k,t1_fj4yx6f,1583071069.0,Even as a joke that's going to far and should never be said in general. I feel bad for the new mom. Her baby is the NICU and her father doesn't seem to care for her or the babies health with those kinds of joke. It's insensitive to the mother who is going through alot. I say NTA because the father is being insensitive to the situation.
AskReddit,fj6bnfj,t1_fj6bczs,1583066177.0,Gosh that sounds all so terrifying. How did you get past those fears? Was it hard to do?
