alchohol is a depressant, in that, i believe you feel that effect after, i.e during the hangover (if its not done in moderation) or maybe you don't feel its effects cause youre inebriated. but yeah i get hyper when i'm drunk -fun/notsofun"
Water_Fasting,f8wg19p,t1_f8wfh9t,1574889976.0,"well funny thing is i stopped smoking, not cause i was actively trying but due to the initial effects of a medication i was taking, wellbutrin, which as an ulterior effect, makes people quit smoking, so at a point in time, i realized it felt like i was just inhaling smoke, and around that time, i was already trying to be healthy and started getting into the ketogenic and fasting lifestyle, and was for a good period, it's just that i think ive created the notion of smoking the occasional cig as a calming ritual, which is now come back to bite me"
Water_Fasting,f8wflzw,t1_f8vxg6z,1574889706.0,"I believe smoking cigs, the nicotine, fucks with the production of insulin, i don't know the nitigrities of it, and that type-2 diabetics should definitely avoid smoking and that smoking cigs leads to type-2 diabetes; so having speculated that, smoking cigs may only momentarily ruin my fast, since nicotine doesn't stay in your body for long, i think

i'm also more so afraid of the smoke, and it creating problems i cant think of, like messing up o2 supply for the duration. 

I do feel hungry right after I smoke, but not after a while, so thats happening, 

for me its majorly for fatloss, fasting has helped in the past, a long way, during my best months, ive fasted, and broken it with broth, and ketochow, which is like a meal replacement for folks that cannot(don't want to) make healthy ketogenic meals on the daily, basically protein, and then you add avacado oil and water, and chug, doesn't taste that bad really, just that you cant constantly rely on a sub-par tasting shake as your source of food

also another major motive is weirdly enough, my mental health and general well being since, i don't know i just live better when i'm fating.....

 \*\*non-sequitur\*\* (also talking about psychoactive stimulants, i was on a theraputic dose of wellbutrinXL, which is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, I don't know what exactly it does(other than inhibit ruptake) but i do know that it is a stimulant of sorts, i told my psyc that i was water fasting, and he was surprisingly understanding/curious and gave me the green light, and didn't notice anything abnormal while i was on it, but then I was on a low dose of Li and I had to stop water fasting since thats dire if you do, i stopped taking that for other reasons and hence able to re-continue this lifestyle.)

.... BUT Anyway, along with weightloss, I do it also for the mental alertness, and the need for lesser sleep, AND that i have a propensity to go on alcohol fueled ragers that might last for a cumulative of 6-7 days in a fortnight, which is clearly not ideal. so this helps me kinda abstain from having a horrible relationship with alcohol which is nice. and i can't smoke weed regularly cause of my security clearance, and that i will have another test coming up

So yeah thats about that, sorry for the long post, it's easy to ramble on a pc,

Oh and ive tried vaping, and the juul more recently, but it's not the same, ritualistically, and with that also, you keep doing it cause it's easy to, so you end up consuming much more nicotine"
Water_Fasting,f8wc25b,t1_f8w0aub,1574887456.0,"Yeah, well it's an addiction, I do feel weird after surely I think im afraid of the smoke doing something I don't know, I've smoked before cause of stress, which I'm in now, which isn't permanent; it's like a drug I pick up and put down at times, funny thing is I've gone a year without it, and I come crawling back"

Water_Fasting,f8ry8b5,t1_f8rmr45,1574759135.0,"Well the number one thing you gotta keep in mind is to maintain your body's electrolytes, else you might feel light-headed and I'm assuming risk a seizure, <= I'm only fairly certain about that.

There are different ways people get their electrolytes, snake juice(Google snake diet) is one, which can be made with stuff from Kroger, or I prefer liquid electrolyte concentrates like hi-lyte

Some purists might say fish oil might break your fast

But you should think about reading about water fasting more, since I think it's safe for the most part if you know what you're doing and can listen to your body to avoid dire circumstances, this is still a fringe diet and lifestyle

But after your first few fasts you'd gain confidence to push the number of days, I'd say go for two or three days to get a feel for it, and if you're a-okay at the end of the third day and feel good, you can go on, a lot of it is just listening and conditioning your body.

Also in fasting you will be in ketosis, so make sure you can be in ketosis, (like diabetic folks should NOT attempt this). And re-feeding is the most important part of the process, which you can read about from experts

I don't know why I wrote all this stuff, I was just a little taken aback by electrolytes missing in your list, so I just wanted to stress that, I hope it doesn't sound like I'm discouraging you, cause I'm not I just wanted to advise caution, since this isn't a community of professionals, neither in fasting nor in medicine"
