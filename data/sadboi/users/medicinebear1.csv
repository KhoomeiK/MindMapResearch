Flagstaff,fi98pmd,t1_fi9498d,1582258380.0,"At least 1K for a studio, so not even a one bedroom is pretty standard and that’s for the some of the oldest places in town. And it hikes up considerably from there as you add bedrooms. Frankly I don’t understand how so many people afford it when most jobs in this town pay so poorly. Ah, the mysteries of life."
Flagstaff,fi89dpa,t3_f6zsmv,1582235890.0,"Unless you have work lined up or money isn’t an issue I’d personally reconsider. While Flagstaff offers a lot of natural beauty and outdoor activities they come at a cost. Rent is very high. Average paying jobs are rare. Spiritual types of communities and activities are available in nearly all metropolitan areas and those may have Flagstaff’s best beat when it comes to Yoga, meditation etc, though we do have both.  Two gyms in Flagstaff have sauna’s and steam rooms so there is more (while  not exactly fantastic) options than 24 hour fitness. I love it here and if you can swing it I’m certain you will too, I’m just trying to be fair and honest and round out your expectations. It’s a pretty simple place, but a very good one if you can make it work. Feel free to ask other questions or message, glad to help & good luck to you."
Flagstaff,fi2n39p,t1_fi2mvce,1582083684.0,Looks like rain/snow in both places. If you’re not actually going to the canyon on sat but say Sunday instead you should be good to go. Hard to enjoy the view getting pelted by rain in my opinion. Safe travels to you.

From what I read you’re doing the right thing, you’ve searched for media to share with him but that’s as far as you can take it. You can’t make him receptive to your help. Depression is a beast and it’s tricky and also extremely subjective so it’s harder to offer blanket statement advice. That said from personal experience the best ingredient is time, sometimes months and even years but time. Remind him gently how worth it he is and how important he is to you, often. Allow him space to process his sadness. Was he close with his dad? That’s can’t be easy.   Educating yourself (like you are!) is amazing and so kind, he’s lucky to have you!  On being suicidal please, get guns out of the picture if they are in it. Try to have him be honest with you about actively having a plan to hurt or kill himself OR if he’s struggling with thoughts of wanting to die, there is a difference. If you have to, take him to get psychiatric help at a hospital or behavioral health clinic. Encourage him to stay sober. Thinking good thoughts for both of you."
