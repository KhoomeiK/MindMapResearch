(Mobile post :/ )

It was 11pm and I had laid down in bed to zone out on Reddit after just cleaning the shower (nesting urge was strong for me) when I heard a loud popping noise in my stomach.. it sounded like someone cracking their neck, so at first I just thought the babies bones were cracking?? Idk, anyways, I got up to use the bathroom and felt liquid trail down my leg, and I had a lightbulb moment of ""oh shit, I think that was my water breaking."" I run to the bathroom and lo and behold, theres my mucus plug and soaked pajama pants. I was actually kind of disappointed because I wanted a large portion of my labor to be at home, but my gyno told me that if my water breaks to get examined right away, so :/ . Hubby and I pack our bags and I start feeling very small contractions after 30 minutes on our way there. By the time I was on the examining bed, it was 2-3AM and I was already at 5cm (!!). So they get me to the labor room and hook me up for the saline drip. I opted for a non-medicated birth, so I spent the next few hours watching Harry Potter and bouncing on a ball. Nurse comes in and examines how dilated I am, and I guess I had been stagnant at 6cm for a few hours so she decided to put some pitocin in the IV. Shes like, ""oh, this will just help speed up your labor :))"" and Im like, ""Oh, okay sure! :))))"" happily bouncing away on my ball. Yeah, things went from like 30 to 100 in barely 10 minutes. Bouncing on the ball quickly became exhausting so I laid in bed hunched over a pillow. Nurse comes in again and Im 8cm. Between contractions I asked about getting gas because the pain was unbearable. I can't remember the exchange very well, but I basically decided ""fuck it, Im this far already, might as well carry it through."" So an hour later (11:20A?) Im on the bed, having a great time, and all of a sudden I pee and start feeling like I need to push (I didn't familiarize it with pooping, as some others do). I press the nurse button and tell her I peed the bed (üòñ) and that I need to push. She checks me, and leaves for what feels like years. Im yelling at my husband ""where the fuck is the doctor!? This babys coming now"" and hes just kind of frantically trying to calm me down, wildly looking at the door. I seriously could have strangled the doctor as she finally came into the room. All of a sudden things were being set up and there were like 8 more people in on the party. One nurse holds my leg while my husband holds the other, and the nurse holding my leg is coaching me through. She was amazing. She told me to press down on my bottom and push each contraction, and I think I only pushed 6 or 8 times. That last push the doctor calls out, ""I see hair!"" And that did it for me. I gave that last push everything I had. When  babys body came out, it felt like giving birth to a jellyfish. She was healthy and crying after 12 hours of labor, and it was the most amazing thing getting to hold her. I didn't cry, which for some reason made me feel bad, but I  smiled at her on my chest through the entire time they were stitching me up ( I had a small labia tear). I had bled a good amount, so I laid in bed with her on my chest for 40 minutes till I had to go pee. Going pee definitely did not feel good, but it felt good to walk around again. I was wheeled to the mama and baby room and stayed there for 2 days. During that time I had an LC in and out of my room because breastfeeding started off horribly for us. I had blood blisters, milk blebs, chafing. Nipple shields weren't even helping. I was dreading each time I had to feed her, and still felt awkward handling her and getting into breastfeeding positions because I'd never been around babies before. Honestly, staying those 2 days were the most emotionally draining part. The last day I was there I was so ready to just go home. But overall, I am so happy with the way things went.

If we keep falling back on this toxic train of thought we will never get anywhere. 
This may be cheesy, but Ive found that a healthier way to look at it is it compare yourself to who you used to be. It drives me to keep moving forward so I can look back at all the progress I have made, whereas comparing my progress to others is just a recipe for feeling defeated."
Knoxville,ern1t8r,t1_ern19rc,1561042626.0,You're welcome! I've also had to use Community Food Connection in Maryville when I first moved into my apartment here last year. I'm not sure what your schedule is like but they are open on Saturdays 10am to 12pm. I believe they only ask for your I.D. and a piece of mail.
Knoxville,ern12zx,t3_c2wtlq,1561042147.0,Fish Pantry in Knoxville has a delivery service for those who can't make it to the physical location. I'd call and ask if they can deliver it to your doorstep while you are at work
homeschool,erio9ss,t3_c29mr0,1560902852.0,I would check your district's alternative high school options. I went through my last two years of high school through an independent study program through the district that was completely online.

Knoxville,erf76gj,t1_erf6yry,1560801600.0,"Thanks, and I should have mentioned this is definitely a career I want to pursue, I'm just taking precautions before I dive into it :)"
AskParents,er455hh,t3_c0enru,1560481332.0,"I think shows like this definitely normalize underage drug use, drinking and casual sex at a very young age. 
Personally, I would not allow my child to ever watch a show like this. Not to shelter them from what can happen behind the scenes in high school, but so they do not accept these behaviours as ""just being a teenager."""
BabyBumps,epy4tjt,t3_bwek6s,1559619423.0,"I would love something like this, especially since I don't know any other women in my area who are pregnant right now. Im 20 years old and 27 weeks, PM me if you'd like!"
Knoxville,eow6n04,t3_btbquk,1558905729.0,Sent you a PM! :)
