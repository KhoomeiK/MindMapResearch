Puppies tend to have a pattern of sprinting then taking a short break and then sprinting again.  That's probably the safest and healthiest thing for them.

Let's say there are a million people about to die instead of 5.  A million vs one.  Each of those million people is as special and valuable as the one.  A million catastrophic losses vs one.  A million mothers/fathers/children/spouses/best friends/siblings etc. dead or one.  Either is a tragedy, but one of those choices is a much bigger tragedy.

I'm not saying I'm right.  I'm just saying that this particular ethical dilemma doesn't give me pause.

They keep whittling down what they're providing. It's reasonable for customers to dislike that."
service_dogs,fdhpwpr,t3_elfmif,1578427822.0,"I'm kinda fuzzy about all this because my school required a diagnosis for anything related to disabilities at all.  It wasn't specific to service dogs.  It was that you had to have a diagnosis to be eligible to work with the disability office and get disability services.  I'm pretty sure that's the norm.

As the other poster asked is it for housing or classes?  That matters because the laws for each are different.

edit:  Looking at your profile, your doctor does not need to know why you're fainting to tell your disability office that you are fainting.  My disability counselor seemed to just want to know the DSM or ICD-10 code from my medical professional.  Those sets of codes have options for situations where a named diagnosis isn't available.  He can just put down that you're fainting and the ICD-10 code for syncope and collapse or whatever is appropriate if your paperwork looks anything like mine did."

""To fully explain cholesterol, you need to realize that it's also vital to your health and well-being. Although we measure cholesterol production in the blood, it's found in every cell in the body. The Harvard Special Health Report Managing Your Cholesterol explains cholesterol as a waxy, whitish-yellow fat and a crucial building block in cell membranes. Cholesterol also is needed to make vitamin D, hormones (including testosterone and estrogen), and fat-dissolving bile acids. In fact, cholesterol production is so important that your liver and intestines make about 80% of the cholesterol you need to stay healthy. Only about 20% comes from the foods you eat. ""

""You may wonder isn't fat bad for you, but your body needs some fat from food. It's a major source of energy. It helps you absorb some vitamins and minerals. Fat is needed to build cell membranes, the vital exterior of each cell, and the sheaths surrounding nerves. It is essential for blood clotting, muscle movement, and inflammation.""
