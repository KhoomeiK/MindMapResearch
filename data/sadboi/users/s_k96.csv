Invisalign,fpqhchq,t3_gez50b,1588822815.0,I‚Äôm on tray 12/32 I also have a permanent retainer behind my bottom incisors. They said they were going to remove it. This has actually been happening since tray 1 in November.My orthodontist noticed this and tried to push down the tray and it just made the tray pop out on my back teeth. He just shrugged and said it would resolve on its own. It‚Äôs better now but still bad. I saw another orthodontist for my last checkup in January but he didn‚Äôt mention it.i should have said something. I don‚Äôt wanna be called non compliant when it‚Äôs not my fault. Alll my other teeth fit perfectly. I had a checkup in March that was cancelled due to the corona virus. Now I can‚Äôt do anything about it but I have some trays i picked up from the office. I mentioned the problem and the secretary said we can‚Äôt help you now. Do I have to do refinements? How long would this extend the process?

PostureTipsGuide,fh1fpof,t3_f10qmz,1581214751.0,"Btw I went to a doctor because my right side of my head, head jaw, arm and shoulder and back were all stiff and cracked and hurt whenever I moved. An orthodontist told me It might be related to my severe crossbite. It‚Äôs been like that for years but I‚Äôm using Invisalign now we‚Äôll see if it helps. It‚Äôs funny how the muscles are all connected. Also my orthopedic doctor took an X-ray because and said that I have cervical lordosis and muscle spasms and told me to take aleve and do physical therapy which I felt was a waste of time and money. I feel like I just really need to work out regularly but I can never get myself to do it or commit."
