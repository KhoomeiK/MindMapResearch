Before ECT you should look into Spravato. It takes longer and the treatments themselves are not pleasant but it will not steal your memories.

showerbeer,foh3qqz,t1_fogwiu6,1587760190.0,"Now you are making me wonder if I know you?!? Hmmm..

Bipolar is such a trip. I‚Äôve been on over 30 different medications. I‚Äôve tried TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). I‚Äôve been through over 30 rounds of ECT. And most recently I‚Äôve been going through esketamine treatment with spravato. 

ECT is lifesaving but there are MAJOR setbacks. It‚Äôs not something you can back out of. You need to finish the schedule. And you will lose a part of your life. 

Here are some questions both of you need to think of? 

Where is she on this [scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/feuvj0/the_suicide_scale_might_be_helpful_to_know_where/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

What kind of mania does she have? Any mixed episodes? What kind of trouble has she gotten into? Manic spells? Drugs? Sex? Debt? Dangerous behavior?

How bad is her depression? Does she wake up suicidal? Does she hurt herself or others? Any suicide attempts? How‚Äôs her hygiene? Can she take care of herself?

How old is she?
Does she have a job? 
Do you have children? 
Do you have WONDERFUL insurance? 
How close are you to the hospital?

Is she willing to lose her memories? Could be months could be YEARS! She will most likely not be allowed to drive during her treatments. Is she okay with that? Does she play an instrument? Is she an artist or creative in some way? Well, she might lose those skills too. 

ECT is a big deal. It saved my life. Unfortunately, I feel like the stigma toward it and the doctors knowledge about it make ECT a very dangerous option. 

I do support ECT. I just wish I was educated more about it and had more control in my treatment plan. 

If you want to talk more about it or if she wants to talk about feel free to message me. You could even call me. ECT might be right for her. It definitely saved me extremely quickly."
