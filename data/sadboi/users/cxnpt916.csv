It’s always so great to hear that others with bipolar are succeeding in such impressive ways!"
bipolar,fdhj749,t3_elcfg7,1578423781.0,"I had the same feelings after I was diagnosed and started medication -- I became suicidal again and was nearly involuntarily committed. Unfortunately, I found that everything I felt got worse immediately after I was diagnosed, but it's much better now. It takes a while for medication to work and you then have to deal your realization that you're saddled with a lifelong illness and everything bad you've felt before will continue to happen. It's common for people to become depressed after being  diagnosed with any chronic illness and adjusting to a new normal, what sucks for us is that the chronic illness encompasses depression and it's hard to disentangle what is bipolar and what is more like situational depression that was triggered by the diagnosis. 

It gets much easier, but it takes time and commitment to treatment. I'm extremely thankful I didn't kill myself and my symptoms are no longer as debilitating as they once were. If you stick to treatment you should get to the other side of it too :)"

bipolar,exk09k4,t3_cspd9q,1566366951.0,100% see your doctor. A similar happened to me after I was diagnosed with bp2 and first put on medication -- I went straight from suicidal depression to hypomania/psychosis at a level I had never experienced before. Things got a lot better after my medications were adjusted (and SSRIs dropped for me) and I've been stable for about two years now. I trust that things will get better for you too!
