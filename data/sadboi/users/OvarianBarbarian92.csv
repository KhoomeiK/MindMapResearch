AmItheAsshole,ffesw07,t3_et7vrr,1579863955.0,Nta- but understand this is probably more of her boyfriend then her talking. He doesn't want you there because you can have a influence on her and the situation. Please find a way to help your siblings they probably dont fully understand what is going or they do and are having trouble handling it. I went threw the same thing almost with my mom and her boyfriend. She moved out my older brother because that is what he wanted. He was a drunk and abusive the last straw was when she finally caught him hurting me. My brother was allowed to move back in immediately and he helped me put a restraining order on my mom's ex boyfriend. They broke up never saw that guy again. I'm sorry you have epilepsy that's a struggle of it's own. I have had a seizure disorder since I was 17. It never really gets easier dude.

I dont want to lose my brother he is the only family I have left, my parents past and my grandparents dont like me at all. I would be alone if she decided to talk him in to cutting ties with me.

As for me I am a lesbian and have know I was since I was kid. but I notice since taking seizure meds around the age of 17 and all the way till now, it almost seems like the medication chemical castrated me in away. I dont have a libido so it is possible it could be the medication. So it might not mean that you are asexual because you would not have any sexual feelings towards women at all. so you wouldn't want to watch porn or deal with anything that is of a sexual nature. Sorry I'm bad at explaining things but I tried."
