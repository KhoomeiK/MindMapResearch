They are thought of as deposit-taking institutions that lend money, but this is not actually true. At law, the word ""deposit"" is meaningless. When you give them money to put into your account, they *lend* it from you. And when you ""borrow"" money, they don't actually lend. Instead, you have created a security which they buy from you with newly created money. You have issued a promissory note which is immediately purchased. 

This works perfectly and is indeed infinitely scalable as long as you only create Bank credit for productive purposes. But if banks create it for consumption, you have more money = more demand for the same amount of goods and services, driving up consumer price inflation. Much worse is creating money for financial transactions, asset transactions and purchasing ownership rights, because you are giving out new purchasing power over already existing resources.

Call me crazy, but I think the FED will do a better job at categorizing their ""lending"" than Wells Fargo. The Dollar may well be strengthened by all of these shenanigans, provided they start doing their job, which they are now kind of forced to.

In any case, take care of yourself. I've had to stop drinking, since its so tempting to think of it as regulatory, when its actually just a huge trigger for me. Rest assured I still do plenty of other drugs, and it feels to me like ""indulging"" in a controlled manner is skill that can be learned.

The similarities between all the maniac stories are funny and fascinating to me, they always seem to involve travel, substance abuse, reckless romance or a combination of all three. Definitely some fear-and-loathing material there, somewhere."
AmItheAsshole,fk8k5mo,t1_fk7x798,1583957587.0,"""Rapid cycling"", in the context of bipolarism, means having four or more mood-swings (""episodes"") within a twelve-month period. Does that seem very *rapid* to you?

Even then, rapid cyclers are the exception, not the norm. My pattern is one or two weeks of mania, followed by two to six months of depression. Then comes a year of semi-normalcy and the cycle starts again. The length and severity of my depression will correlate directly with how much I indulged in my mania, so the way I dealt with my illness wasn't primarily through medication, but through building a support-network that can recognize the signs when I become volatile and keep me grounded.

Mania used to turn me into a charismatic, lying, womanizing scumbag. It was like being on a two-week cocaine-bender. I would do unspeakable things to people to keep me high, and once it wore off, I was usually surrounded by the shambles of my life where a drained bank-account was the least of my worries. I wish I had parents I could trust enough to act as my fiduciaries.

Because last time I checked, most legumes still had a protein content that is absolutely comparable to most meats. They also have more fiber, more iron, more calcium, more magnesium, more vitamins, no cholesterol *and take ten times less resources to produce*.

If you want easily digestible protein and fast gains, you don't eat meat, you eat a ton of peanut butter. Which are also legumes btw, unlike true tree nuts.
