The impact of the voting system is way overestimated in the US. Americans have a two-party system because they secretly love uniformity. When they move to another suburb, they feel comfortable knowing there will be a McDonalds, a Walmart and a high-school football stadium.

It's quite possible to have a one-party or a three-party system under FPTP, although the third party will have a low number of seats. The system is even favorable to regional separatists. 

And as Guastella admits, minority parties can be effective as pressure groups that have their ideas stolen by the two main parties. The most successful leader in recent British history was Nigel Farage, who was never elected to Westminster.

A third party did have a significant impact in recent history: Ross Perot got 19% of the popular vote in 1992, helped elect Bill Clinton and pushed both parties to a balanced budget policy."

He's also feuding with and suing Hotwheels, who used to run 8chan and sold it to him."
CryptoCurrency,fn3eskc,t1_fn3b4ja,1586619263.0,"Bitcoin might be a hedge against inflation on a longer time frame, but it's not immune to a sharp recession, and it remains more volatile than the stock market, which is a much bigger market and has some connection to intrinsic value. Only a small slice of all existing bitcoin are actively traded, so the price is always a bit of an illusion propped on by inactive hodlers.

Some people will sell bitcoin when they lose their job and need money, or when they get a margin call on their stock portfolio. Then there are traders who sell in order to buy back cheaper later. 

This effect is reinforced on derivatives markets. Something weird happened on BitMex on March 12: more and more long positions were liquidated and the bottom fell out of the market. At the same time, there was a botnet attack, but it seems like that actually helped to stop the bleeding by shutting down the site."

A large number of countries have a hygienic culture, where wearing masks is normal during flu season, and took the virus seriously due to their experience with SARS. On the other side of the world, a large number of countries just let the virus spread until it was to late to do anything other than a lockdown to flatten the curve."

> I'm not some liberal who puts his whole hopes into a single personality, so I'm fine.

> And I'm gonna keep fighting to utterly destroy you and everything you stand for.

By the way, ""We need to have a [conversation](https://twitter.com/St_Rev/status/614689027933999104)"" means ""You need to listen to my lecture."""
