But really reading posts like yours where I feel like it mirrors my story is the best because I know I’m not alone in this!! 😊
vaginismus,fo9ccrb,t3_g6f7xf,1587615728.0,I’m so sorry :( I’ve had similar experiences and really feel for you! You’re not alone out there. I feel very alone dilating and it’s not fun to do especially when you don’t feel supported doing it. I feel the same way. My PT says to just do little bits each day and eventually it’ll get better. I just try to tell myself that😥

This is how I always use hard wax 🤷🏼‍♀️

I’m on session 5 and we just got to a place of taking my underwear off and she’s using her finger to show me how the different muscles feel when she touches them. Trying to normalize the feeling for me basically. She’s so helping and moves slows and never pushes me. Try it!!

When it first flared up my entire face was RED and little bumps. People thought I was allergic to something! So embarrassing and the worst when skincare is literally your job. I feel for you girl. I try to not give up but my confidence has gone down on my facials significantly at work :( I just try to do the best I can and accept that I can still give a great facial even if my skin personally looks like shit :(

We dated for 2 years and we broke up literally when he got back from that basic training thing in MITT. I just...am a very skeptical person naturally and when he got back from the workshop I swear to god that GQ article is so true he was like shoving this thing down my throat about how amazing it was but didn’t really tell me anything of substance about it. I’m not super surprised he joined it bc he was always looking for a “community” to be apart of and he was really into the whole self improvement type of stuff.  Anyone PM me if you have any more questions lol.
