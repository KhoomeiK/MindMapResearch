For me, it was his dialogue, and composure. I find solace in the fact that Newtrox isn't necessarily as bloodthirsty murderholic, but rather suicidal in his spiraling existential crisis.  Honestly, if a new champions came out with his old attitude, and like jax/yi or someone was nerfed and given elements of his old playstyle, I'd be a little happier as well."
AatroxMains,et5r20a,t3_c8wvhb,1562485400.0,"Listen up you little shit.

Runes, go Conqueror, just do it pussy.  you're going to want to take Triumph for those sweet heals when your adc who is infinitly more competent than you for picking Aatrox support, gets those kills and keeps you alive with your meager assists. Tenacity so you can cry home to mama without anyone stopping you. And Last stand, because you're going to be at low health a lot, like the punching bag you're making yourself by taking Aatrox support.  Secondary go Transcendence because on your limited gold income your broke-ass is going to want to be able to have some form of spammability you didnt have to drop 800 gold on in early game. And gathering storm, because you'll be too broke to afford the one stat that actually makes you useful as a fucking champion (why the hell would you take Aatrox support??!?)- AD. 

Items you're going to want to grab to make it easier for your team to carry your dumbass to victory, include but are not limited to

\-Relic shield path so your ADC doesn't actually think youre trolling, you have to at least let him know that no, you are not. You're just autistic.

\-Build yourself an AD item component, so you're not as MUCH of a chump, I'm quite fond of Hexdrinker, or Jaurim's Fist.  Finsih it off late into a maw or Steraks

\-Okay fuck why did you go support. Knights vow. Don't make your team report you.

\-Zeke's Convergence so you're at least still a little bit of a threat when you pop ultimate.

\-Take a fucking HP item, Sterak's if you went for the hexdrinker, or a Spirit visage if you didn't.

\-Round of your defenses, buy a Spirit visage, or a steraks if you went Hexdrinker.

\-Get some fucking boots on so the grass doesn't tickle you too hard and hurt you like the little bitch you're being by going Aatrox in the support role. What a waste of potential and a disappointment to Aatrox the world ender."

AatroxMains,et5q5q5,t1_et1yzc3,1562484157.0,I get sad realizing I'm going to need to play ADC most games just so no one else has the opportunity to fuck up so horribly and ruin it.
AatroxMains,et5q34o,t1_et5or78,1562484060.0,"Im going to throw in that the EQ combo can be used in tandem. You can use the E in the middle of your Q before it lands to reposition. That's a very cookie cutter combo when things go extremely well, but a lot of the times you'll miss that combo if only because your W hits a minons. Aatrox is very cool because he has a lot of adaptability in his kit, for example, the combo I usually end up going is Q(E when you have enough CDR to do it later), Q, QE, Auto, W and walk away.  Hitting your first Q isn't really priority since it's only used to help set up the rest of your combo but it isnt necessary because it's damage isn't too hot and it can be difficult to hit.  But you can land it once, walk forward a smidge, and Q again to catch them at the tip as they try to walk away, and throw your W out if they try to escape because they'll probably leave their wave if they need to because no one wants to  walk close to an Aa when his 3Q is up. But if they do, you just throw your 3Q on them with that saved E if they try to pull the slick trick dashes (Fuck you fiora), slam W down, Autoattack, and walk away because they'll get pulled into it as you make your escape since your CD's are blown.  Also, if you want the big dick plays, you can use your Flash instead of E if it's down and you need that clutch Q.  Laning with aatrox is about finding the combo your most comfortable with mechanically, throwing it out to see how the enemy reacts, and then following up on that by tailoring it to what their patterns are. It's pretty similar to playing the Black Prior in For Honor, if you've done that."

AatroxMains,eprquuz,t3_bvpxnl,1559429551.0,"So what you're going to do most of the time from my experience, is to only really ""engage"" after landing your first Q if you think you can do it. My typical trade is just using Q, W, Q/E to help land the second Q and keep them in the W, and throw my third Q in the sweetspot of the W once they're yanked back and auto them.  Using your dash isnt before or after your Q, it's used in the middle of your Q to adjust the sweetspot and help you land it better. Visually it would look like ""begin Q-2, dash, land Q-2."""
