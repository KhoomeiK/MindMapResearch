You are doing great by your tomatoes. Transplanting stresses plants no matter what. By following the schedule on the seed packet, I think they give the information to have the healthiest start. Planting earlier does lead to larger plants when transplanting into the ground (or container), and it sets them back quite far when you put them into their final location. 

Against my better judgement I re-transplanted a tomato plant that was doing great last year. I wanted the pot for a pepper to go in, and I had bought a larger pot for the tomato. That tomato plant got 6 feet tall and gave me a single tomato. The plants I didn't transplant a second time gave me a more regular harvest. I don't think that tomato ever fully recovered from transplanting after it had settled nicely into the smaller pot.

A lot of the larger plants sold at nurseries have already been transplanting once if not twice. Every time we move them, we're damaging our chances of it producing well."

The only reason I have no debt is because my dad bailed me out or would use his credit card and I would struggle to pay him back. I ended up selling a really nice camera and my first sewing machine that I really miss, but I still never got him all the money back. I also stopped paying rent in a place I was staying in, because the girl wasn't paying for the utilities with the money and it made me mad.

I have 2 different ones for the state of Idaho, one for medicinal and one for edible. I've marked the pages of all the things I've found in my own yard (wood sorrel, mallow, dandelion, plantain, black medic) and take the books with me if I'm going anywhere outdoors"
herbalism,fogh96t,t1_fofu377,1587752556.0,Maybe other apps would be more useful to OP than this one.

I fantasize about that kind of thing, too. I want to jump off the roof of my work because it's so easy to get to. Or jump in the compactor. Then I think ""how horrible would it be for my coworkers to find be?"" Unfortunately I love all my coworkers... Just hate the company we all work for"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,foge925,t1_fogaka9,1587751459.0,"People have commented on my slowness as well. I have ADHD, I'm not positive how much it relates to it or not. There's also auditory processing disorder. I want to find a doctor here so I can maybe figure it out. I honestly just want help in my life."

I'm happy it wasn't emotionally devastating for you, in fact the opposite. Live your life the way you want it!! Sans children!!!"
AmItheAsshole,fog83fc,t3_g77rzf,1587749148.0,"NTA - I have high pain tolerance. I once dated a guy with a low pain tolerance and severe acne. I would take care of his back but he wouldn't be able to handle it for more than a minute.  In retaliation (for me *helping* him *at his request*) he would act like I had a zit where I couldn't see so that he could pretend to pop it just so he could try to hurt me enough to get a reaction. Granted, he had cystic acne and that definitely hurts. That doesn't mean he gets to hurt people because he hurts. 

I'm not saying your husband is going to try to hurt you, but he is being overdramatic and he *is* affecting you personally with this shit, and he refuses to stop. I think he needs a therapist more than a doctor."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,foe1119,t3_g6p168,1587693931.0,"I really suck at talking. I stutter, I have to restart talking, I also lose my trail of thought half way through. If something is happening for long enough for (a) me to notice and (b) for me to think of something to say, I'll eventually say it just because I've thought it over enough times to feel confident I can get it out intelligently enough to be understood. If something happens fast, I can't do shit. I'll watch it happen and it's like slow motion, but my mind takes so long to process things, I won't be able to understand what's happening fast enough to even think of something to say before it's over. 

I hate myself for how quiet I am, but I can't really see how I can improve"

 My altar is personally covered with almost nothing but plants. I have a spot where I placed a bowl containing my current intentions this lunar cycle and the stones for that spell, as well as a few skeletal figures in yoga poses (who help support some of the plants!)"
witchcraft,fod15fy,t1_fobmtbx,1587678564.0,"Right. It used to bother me a lot too.

I have severe depression. I don't know if you've experienced this, but at my lowest, everyone tries to explain to me how to get out of it. Just do yoga! (I do.) Get outside! (My passion is gardening.) Meditate! (I do that, too.) 

I guess I just know now that any one person can't just give me the information that I personally need to get to where they are. I see things differently than another person, and what they've done to get to the top of whatever ladder they're on, isn't what I need to do to get there. 

Plus, how do you explain a life time, when that is the answer? How can you take everything in you that you've done, and boil it down to a tutorial?"
witchcraft,fob7xn8,t1_foamhld,1587657050.0,"I want to expand on the research thing.

Talking to people who have experience you don't have, is research. Getting online and finding a group of people who are interested in what you're interested in, and talking to them and asking questions, is research. Finding peer reviewed articles with actual bibliographies is research. I personally like to read blogs, but these are not always accurate. It's still research.

That said, this is a deeply personal matter that perhaps can't just be ""explained"". I am interested in learning about deities and I am comfortable learning about this on my own because from everything I've read... It is incredibly individual! Just because OP is experiencing what others might want to experience, doesn't mean she (I'm assuming correct if wrong) can just sit down and type up a guide. Maybe she doesn't know exactly what she did to deserve these attentions, but is happy enough to continue with them. Which is perfectly fine for her to do."

I met another person who had 7:21 as her number. It was strongly associated with her grandmother, who ended up dying at 7:21pm. She feels a connection to her Grandma at that time of evening."
childfree,fo7t2m5,t3_g60f6c,1587584066.0,"She's going to be miserable if she has dreams of that guy getting off his feet and doing *anything* for that child, if he hasn't done anything for his other kids yet. 

I'm so glad the only people in my life who have had children were in good positions to do so at the time they did it (altho one of them had a kid from before and they weren't doing okay at all for a long time) because I don't know if I would be able to hold back on my thoughts. I think more people should be really open about why having kids isn't fun, because there's so many women out there who just did it because that was the next step in life."
