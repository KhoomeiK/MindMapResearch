MentalParental,fl53ifn,t3_e1v5uv,1584827661.0,"I have been feeling guilty and selfish for having children. I was made aware by my psychiatrist that I could trigger another episode or if that wasn't bad enough it is in my genes. I had 4 children, my baby boy who is 21 has been diagnosed also. He's addicted to drugs and alcohol, sees no light in that dark tunnel of sadness and basically has given up. I might lose him. I have no one to blame but myself and my desire for children. I just can't get passed this."
mentalillness,fi28ds1,t3_f5zh9x,1582073837.0,"Have you been diagnosed? Maybe a simple tweak in your meds. Now, if you can rule out all the stuff you are doing right, maybe something or someone is doing you wrong. Like not supporting you and not involved with your healing. Sometimes the toxicity isn't even us, it's us allowing anything or anyone toxic to be around us."
mentalillness,fi27qf9,t3_f5x5jd,1582073409.0,"Something similar happened to me 33 years ago. The only difference being is, I did die. I made the decision, and executed my ""perfect"" plan. Since I'm typing this obviously I failed. I was resuscitated and in a coma I eventually came out of. My lesson is this. While I was in a coma I was dreaming. I guess my brain was thinking I was dead. It terrified me so badly I can't give you the details, I get anxiety to think about it. I was or at least felt what limbo was like. Nothing is worth that price for your soul eternally."

Don't forget, only the strongest carry the heaviest of burdens. Sadness is everywhere, but so is joy. Find it. I wish you the best of everything this universe has for you. Take care."

mentalillness,fhezy9s,t3_f2t3pv,1581533361.0,"How old are you? I've had drug resistant bipolar 1 for over 40 years. ECT is my only alternative so far as I know. I'm like the girl in ""50 first dates"", once I go to sleep everything gets erased. I'm exaggerating but my short term memory has suffered. I believe I've been where you are right now. The pain was physical, I could feel it in my very depth. That's when the cutting began. Don't go there and don't give in. I've lost many, many years of happiness. All because I could not imagine I had a say so in the matter. You do. You have the control and you can do something about it. If you are around toxic people or environment, GET OUT! Always take your meds. Cut out depressants, alcohol etc. Finally, live your life not what someone else thinks you should live but the way you imagine that happy life and go get it. My heart and prayers are with you, you shall overcome my friend."
mentalillness,ffx3u6h,t3_evnf8v,1580317167.0,Try reading. It's proven that reading uses a substantial amount of glucose. A doctor once told me that digging a ditch uses around the same amount as reading. I'm not to sure about that but I do know it helps me sleep.

Positive attitude and meditation are very good at keeping your mood in a stable and that anger that comes with it. How are your relationships with your friends?

I decided that I had a life to live and if it was a shitty life I was going to change it. Haven't looked back since. Thank you for letting me share what took me 30 years to learn.
