One, this man is a piece of shit.  Six years is just not enough.  Chemical castration and twenty years minimum.  Examples should be made.  Also, make sure he's put in to general population, and his crimes announced to all inmates.  Ah, to dream.

Two.  Two male friends left their young drunk female friend in an Uber with a stranger?  That's purely irresponsible and negligent.  They should have seen her home safely, or at least had her dropped off first.  There is a reason why I always walk my female friends to their car, or offer to give them a ride instead of an Uber.  There are a lot of creepy men out there that will attempt to overpower a young woman.  A coworker of mine once told me that she got a lift from the airport with another female friend.  The driver, seeing how attractive they were, said ""you looked stressed, if you like, we can pull over, find a spot, and I can massage you.""  No more rideshare for them after that.

Three.  ""Guilty of sexual intercourse without consent.""  Bullshit PC terminology. Child rape, he's a rapist.  He raped a young woman below the age of consent.  Can we please stop softening the terms?

Four.  ""Out of character and opportunistic?"" Howabout ""deplorable, opportunistic, and worthy of severe punishment?""

Five.  The jury accepted his initial defense? He was driving his Uber at the time!  The idea that they accepted that he engaged in a sex act in the backseat with a minor while on the job is indefensible in an of itself."
