[My uncle almost went to jail for the rape and murder of a woman they picked up at a bar](http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-4431.html)

My uncle was hanging out with this friends when they decided to pick up a woman from a bar, and she ended up dead in the woods with her vagina cut out. The guy had anger issues, and I think it stemmed from him constantly being turned down for sex because he had a colostomy bag. He flew into a rage and dragged her into the woods, cut out her lady parts while she was still alive, stabbed her repeatedly and then slit her throat. She was found about two weeks later, I think.  


[Cousin decided that he wanted the land that was inherited to another family member, so he killed the whole family](http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/South/03/01/missing.family/index.html)

Guy was a pretentious know it all. He always thought that he should have everything better than what everyone else had. He was stuck up and just a real pain in the ass. He always talked about how he was going to inherit so much stuff that he'd never have to work again. He got pretty mad when a big piece of land that he thought was going to be his when his grandfather died ended up going to his cousin, so he killed the guy, his wife, and their young son.

[Myra Lewis](http://charleyproject.org/case/myra-rena-lewis)

Myra's mother went into town to run errands and left her with Myra's father. She was last seen playing in her front yard. Myra's father assumed that Myra was with her mother, and when they discovered that she was missing hours later, they searched for her. The town of Camden is very spread out and very rural- her father even used a 4-wheeler to go looking for her because of the location of their home- it's on a very rural road. There was no trace of her ever found. Her mother was arrested not too long after her disappearance on food stamp fraud, but she never mentioned anything about Myra even though a lot of the town thinks she had something to do with her disappearance.

[Tammyetta Spaulding](https://www.truecasefiles.com/2019/08/the-disappearance-of-tammyetta-spaulding.html)

Tammyetta was last seen dropping her kids off at school. She went to work as usual, and disappeared shortly thereafter. Her SUV was found abandoned behind a gas station, and it had been wiped clean. She had been in a relationship with a guy and had gotten pregnant by him, but broke things off with him after she found out that he had gotten another girl pregnant. Months after she disappeared, an unknown woman was in contact with Tammyetta's aunt, and told her that they would never find her, because her body was dissolved with acid, and that Tammyetta's ex-boyfriend had something to do with her murder. Rumors have started that her ex-boyfriend and his girlfriend lured her somewhere, killed her, and left her vehicle behind the gas station to be found later.  


  
[Leigh Occhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Leigh_Occhi)  


Leigh Occhi was a 13-year old girl who went missing from her home during Hurricane Andrew. Her mother had gone to work that morning, and called their home from her job to check up on her later. Leigh never answered the phone, so her mother hurried back home, only to find blood in the home and no sign of Leigh. Later, her eyeglasses were mailed to the home, addressed to Leigh's ex-stepfather, but nothing came of it. Rumor has it that the Sunday School teacher that Leigh knew, [Oscar McKinley ""Mike"" Kerns](http://state.sor.dps.ms.gov/OffenderDetails.aspx?Display=Main&Id=374582) , is the one who kidnapped her.

Angela was last seen at her job at Pizza Hut in Petal, MS about 1 AM, talking to her ex-boyfriend, who had recently gotten her pregnant. Her Honda was found a few hours later at the [Mahned Bridge](https://bridgehunter.com/ms/perry/mahned/). Her blood and shoes were at the scene, but Angela was nowhere to be found.   


  
[Asia Martin](http://charleyproject.org/case/asia-nicole-martin)  


Asia went missing after going for a walk from her Robinson Place Apartments and was never heard from again. She had spoken with her mother on the phone shortly before her disappearance, and was planning on taking a bus trip to see her mother in Colorado. Her mother is now deceased, but her father is still alive and living in Slidell, LA.   


  


[Jeffrey Keith Hegwood](http://charleyproject.org/case/jeffrey-keith-hegwood)  


Jeffrey was a young bar owner (the bar is demolished now and is a parking lot). He was scheduled to go on a date at 9 pm and never arrived. Later on that night, his car was involved in a hit-and-run, and was found abandoned at a dead-end street. His half-brother, who Hegwood had never met, was involved in a police shootout in Ontario and was killed. He had Hegwood's ID on him at the time."
