Cantaloupe is known for being a great natural anxiety reliever. Due to it's high potassium content, this fruit can help normalize the heartbeat as well as stimulate the body to take in more oxygen to the brain. As you eat this melon the body relaxes and anxiety disappears."
loner,fkn1otp,t3_fjgz4x,1584349365.0,Yea I can
Anxietyhelp,fkn0v8a,t1_fkmnx78,1584348282.0,It's not a myth. The virus is in Africa yet there r no known cases of death. And the black people whom have it in places like America r low. It's not a myth its statistics but ok. Seems like people r greatly mis understanding my response to this post. I'm in no way trying to fool people to doing nothing and be reckless. I'm just trying to calm people who r scared. That's it. The media has been hyping up the virus and create g panic. I just want to bring further insight.
Empaths,fkn0g2p,t3_fjg4v4,1584347728.0,"The virus has a 3% mortality rate but almost a %60 recovery rate and its mostly a problem for people who r age 50+ or who have already bad illness issues. Black people r the least affected yet can still get it. Men have a higher chance of getting it than women .So honestly it's not that big a deal its just a scare. Just keep the immune system up with vitamin c and clean yourself and drink lots of spring water. Try not to be in close contact with groups of people and public items. A 86yo and 100yo women both beat corona virus. I'm in no way saying u shouldn't take the spread seriously, u should just be more calm about it and not panic."

But by all means go and self isolate in a closet please. We need less of people like u who aren't educated or even try. I'm here trying to help and calm people down but I see ur a ""lets panic and run from people so we don't get sick"" kinda person but u say I have an ""ego"". Before u comment on someone else's comment fist think ""hey do i know wtf I'm saying? Did i even search anything up? Will what I say help anyone?. By all means drops some facts and knowledge about the virus to correct me so I can relay the message to others. I have no intention to mislead anyone."

Meditation,fklk4sj,t1_fkk6xbj,1584308173.0,But those r simulators tho. I'm talking about updated stats and percentages of what's already done. They've had simulators like that for many previous diseases like we swine flu sars ebola etc. But I don't understand what ur saying people should be more aware but I just wouldn't want someone to panic into isolation. I've seen to many people doing that
Meditation,fkljvqo,t1_fkk7gkj,1584307987.0,"This is true and I sorry but I was just referring to the person of this post. For those who r elder or have current illnesses it is best to stay a firm distance away from large groups and clean yourself regularly. But it's still hope. If u search it up I saw a 86yo and a 100yo women both beat corona virus. So it's still hope and manage able to avoid. Do what u can to boost ur immune system as best as possible., try not to come in close contact with people or publicly touched items, and clean ur hands often. I recommend going to the CDC website for bettee info but u should just research the rate of the virus in general to stay informed"
Meditation,fklj87p,t1_fkk7q71,1584307522.0,Yea true
Meditation,fklj6ga,t1_fkkabrz,1584307486.0,Huh. Where did u get that. That's not at all what I said. Don't listen to me. Research up on it
Meditation,fklj4ka,t1_fkkcvke,1584307448.0,Stfu have u done any research at all. But be the headass and lock yourself in the closet if u ever so please.

Meditation,fkk44oy,t1_fkk3fau,1584272711.0,"Scaring people to self isolate is doing damage in itself. That creates panic. U shouldnt self isolate u should be clean and aware to not expose yourself to contact with alot of things or people and keep keep it immune system up. Self isolation is just pushing it. It's an airborn virus whether u touch someone or not or be around them or not its still flowing throw parts of near by air potentially. The goal is to stay calm and be aware and clean. Not to panic and shut yourself from civilization. Besides id the virus was that easily obtained by not isolating yourself yourself, nearly everyone would have it. The millions of people panic buying and panic stocking would all have it but they don't. Treat the virus as any other could or disease. Panicking and self isolation leads to other bad things like fear and Axiety both bad for ur health. No one is saying be reckless and go lick a bus sign outside or something foolish like that. It is statistics literally saying those who r elder or have current illnesses r at most risk, those who aren't of that category are at low risk and even so have a high chance of recovery. But yes I understand avou t the healthcare system. Idk maybe it's different in ur country. I live in America so idk"
Meditation,fkk34m0,t1_fkk30sw,1584271548.0,When I say it's not a big deal I mean if ur afraid of catching the virus. It's a low chance for u to get it and its a high chance if u recovering. That's all I ment by that. I didn't mean to offend anyone

SuicideWatch,fkifdhw,t3_fihlor,1584218701.0,"Well. How bout this different approach. Instead of u reaching out to someone, I'll reach out to u. I be on Reddit looking over the suicide, kind voice, lonely, and Axiety pages and I reach out to those whom I can lend a ear to hear their pain. I'm currently in college for psych to pursue my passion to become a therapist to help those in need like yourself. So I can atleast promise its pretty impossible to annoy me or overload me with ur pain. If anything I wanna here it all so I can try to do whatever it is I can to help even if that means I just listen. So if u ever one just wanns chat don't hesitate to hmu any time"
