Anxiety,fgmkmc0,t3_ez8uhq,1580926488.0,Absloutly iv been diagnosed with generalised anxiaty disorder and it took me untill I was 26 to have so far my only panic attack where I thought I was having a hart attack which ment for the last 27 years of my life I have been having prolonged anxiaty without ever understanding it and it took one bad job to finaly busrt the danm that had been building for 27 years. After I got treatment this year I have seen so many of signs that u missed like constant persistent stress headaches and bsck and shoulder pains that never truly went away until my anxiaty dropped with the use of medication. So I absloutly belive somone can have prolonged and persists anxiaty that just build and manifests as a dark cloud in the background of some ones life. Just for added context I was in a totall and clinical prolonged depression for a few months when I was diagnosed with my generalised anxiaty disorder as the cause of my depression. And it has taken a yest of treatment to get me to about half way on my road to recovery. So if your asking this because you think this maybe what's happening I just want to say I know it sounds bad but it's OK to ask for help it's OK to admit something is wrong and seek professional help no matter how much it may feel shameful or unolesent its OK iv been thier and I know it gets better but thier are alot of people who are willing to help you and the road ahead is worth the journey I'm only half way thier and my life is amazing already iv got great friends and a beautiful girl who loves me and a family that's supported me all the way and I'm sure you will have some if not all of these in your life as soon as you take the step towards help. And if you want to talk please feel free to DM me and I will always be thier to talk a stranger who cares about your journey.

Which is basicly a good, 80% with that being said dialog has the best overall Coverage island wide this will be important, as u will find modern smart phone battery's tend to run out faster when Ur in Sri lank due to the constant loss of signal. When not using data switch off Ur mobile data it will save Ur battery and try and use WiFi as much as possible. Stay away from hutch and most other providers Ur best bet is mobitel or dialogue. plus dialog and mobitel are what lost people use so they sometimes do free calls to number on the same network which means if you are going with many people you can esential call each other for free.

Edit :

Forgot to mention you can by the simcards at the airport and almost every little side of the road shop will be able to sell you recharge vouchers for these companies so you will be able to top up even in the smallest of towns. Which is great if Ur traveling. Just look for a boards in the shops with the phone company logo or even ask any random person on the street most locals will be able to point you to the closest recharge point.
