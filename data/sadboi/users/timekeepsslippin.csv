But you will, I just recommend you don't do it the second time, even two days apart is risking it (plus you never know if it will hit the same as the first time, or make you feel like complete shit). 5 g seems to be way too much too, Those subs recommend you start with 1 g or half of that, and remember it takes hours for it to kick in. I'm pretty sure 5 g in one sitting is very risky.

I was interested in phenibut and still am, but something I would take way more serious than any other drug. After reading the horror stories, I'm not so sure about going near it. But do as you wish, just try to be safe about it and read up on it first."

sandiego,fmgbbit,t1_fmftvts,1586045251.0,"San Diego was actually the second city to have bloods and crips before any other non LA city, west coast crips started in 1973. Lincoln park bloods were first known as Paul Lowe’s control because of a liquor store in the neighborhood owned by Paul Lowe who I believe was a former charger? But he didn’t want his name associated with them so they changed to Lincoln park piru i believe at first, at one point were Lincoln park crips, and another point were called syndicate mob. Skyline piru was at first East side hang gang. I think the first blood/crip gang was the basement bloods/59 brims which was started by a brim gang member from LA in the early 70s unless skyline was first, I forget.

San Diego was also the first city to have a collaboration between a blood and crip on a rap song, which was between black Mikey (brims) and big June (piru), I recall some story of black Mikey having to sneak into fam mart to buy all the copies since issues arised from it. Not sure if i got that story right but it was something along those lines

Edit: I got the collaboration part totally wrong by mistake. I think it was Cricet (NHC 40s) with Black Mikey (brims). The error being that brims and pirus are a part of the damu (Swahili for blood) family. So neither are crips. Still trying to confirm who collaborated but pretty sure it was them."

San Carlos has goon mob in the apartments nicknamed the pinkies , they say they aren’t a gang but a family but they act like a gang lol, I could care less regardless, when i lived there I had no problems walking around there. there are some Ogs from Lincoln and emerald hills that live there but they are normal every day people."

Like damn these people can’t get a break, either they commit crimes and they’re the scum of the earth, or they do good things to help the community and they get negatively compared to other groups that commit more atrocities."
todayilearned,f90187j,t1_f8ytype,1574967087.0,"You have valid points but to me that’s just strength in numbers. Mexico operates different than the US, and bloods and crips started as a reaction towards constant bombardment from other groups of individuals. I’m not sure how cartels started but I’m sure it’s not cause they were subject to racial violence.

Sure cartels are powerful and brutal but that’s cause they have the man power and are in a country that doesn’t give a fuck/works in their favor. Damus and Kiwes have no one in their favor yet the culture they created was globally infuential.

I’ve seen all those cartel videos. When they do that shit it’s not one man doing it, they have a bunch of their butt buddies armed to the teeth. I have no doubt you catch one of those dudes slipping while he’s alone and with no gun (which I doubt ever happens), and put him against a blood or a crip and the evil mr cartel man is going to get his ass whooped.

Cartels just have way more people, connections and way less laws so of course they will do wtf they want and unleash their aztec or Inca or whatever roots and savagely sacrifice whoever the fuck they want.

And obviously if you put a US gang member (non Latino) in a Latin American or mexican prison they will probably be tail tucking but no shit, there’s fkn thousands of Mexicans and one or two of them. Maybe they won’t be scared either and handle their own. I’d trust a young Piru with his back against the wall compared to a cartel surrounded by black gangs.

The nature of bloods and crips aren’t like cartels either, there’s no gang leaders or shit like that, it’s more of a family. Cartels are soulless killing machines and it’s easy for them cause there’s so fuckin many of em. Of course your gonna do crazy shit when you got hundreds of your people with you and military grade artillery. Most bloods and crips either do their shit by themselves or with maybe 4-5 homies tops. Idk about you but that takes more balls than riding around with multiple trucks with crazy ass guns.

I’m sure you aren’t doing this but I can’t stand when people romanticize cartels when talking about them. Fuck cartels. Some mexican gangs in LA with cartel ties can’t even hold their own in neighborhoods shared with enemy brims bloods crips or Hoover’s. Even today when you got 100 fkn Mexicans in La for every one black person it seems.

Put one of these cartel members in a room alone with an OG like Tookie, Monster Kody from 8/3 gangster crip, mike lok from elm street piru (RIP), or OG turtle from Santana blocc Compton crip—with no guns or weapons allowed—and I guarantee you that narco trafficker is gonna be scared to death and will get beat half dead"
todayilearned,f8ybgrw,t1_f8h73y0,1574944452.0,"rolling around in pickup trucks with big guns and a bunch of guys isnt hard at all. OG Damus and Crips were monsters with or without guns, and would fuck you up in a second regardless if they were outnumbered. 

Sure cartels are pretty psychopath but shit theyre always surrounded by a bunch of men and drinking that liquid courage, with bookoo ammo and guns. 

Catch one of these Young Pirus or Crip and id put my money on them tearin the shit out of a cartel member if it came down toe to toe."
