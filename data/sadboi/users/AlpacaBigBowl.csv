Weed is wild man. Terps can get thrown off if the grower decides to do something like being in their equipment by truck instead of by hand. Something as simple as more dust in the air from vehicles around the plants and such.

I’d encourage you to give it a quick google or Reddit search. You’ll find everybody is a little different. Luckily, I haven’t had it happen in a long time. But years ago I remember one of my early dabs in the bathroom of our college apartment. Hot dabs off titanium nail, before quartz was even popular, that wasn’t very well kept. Some shitty extract too I’m sure. 5 dudes in a bathroom with the shower running trying to keep the “smell” away. Stupid as fuck. But instant beads of sweat as you can imagine.

You’re definitely right it does waste some and not produce as much smoke. But on the flip, taking hot dabs, to me seems unhealthy. Just a lot of heat and rather not feel deathly with the dab sweats every time. But that’s just me. If you enjoy it keep rockin.

Dabs,f2rqerq,t1_f2roo59,1570375516.0,"Well you never asked that before but I’m happy to answer. And nope other things aren’t for peasants. I too enjoy diamonds and batter but per the post we are talking on high end and as I’ve mentioned many times. This dude definition is OFF. I also see you use the term rosin very loosely, that’s a mistake. You know how many types of solventless extract there are? And consistencies? I mean you can get rosin, live rosin, lava, cold cure batter, 6* water hash, full melt and it goes on. And all of that even depends on what micron you working with. You can even get solventless live resin just so ya know. Resin doesn’t necessarily mean bho although it’s far far more common.

Short answer, at this current time 6* water hash or live heads is as high as it goes

Edit: high end also has to do with brand and the flower it’s coming from for sure. How it was frozen, how it was grown, and how heads were extracted
