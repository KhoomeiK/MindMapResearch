As guardian angels, we tend to study the human behaviour in very boring details varying from drinking other mammals' milk, to trying to move things with their minds, so you could say we have a pretty strong background on how humans work. Before being set for a certain target, we had to monitor everything they do for 3 human-days for the sake of studying their interests and whatnot. 

For this week, I got appointed in the children's section, definitely less work than the Schizophrenic's one I was in. No beggie or so I thought, I had been appointed to too many children over the course of many human-decades. Until today.

This child I could sense was very different from the past ones I've monitored, no lectures have ever readied me for him, but still, I was willing to try and see how things go. As the first day, he woke up and saw me standing next to him, 

""Good morning!"" I said,

""Who are you?""

""I'm your new friend, you can call me Donnie, what about you?""

""Kevin.""

""Goodbye Kevin.""

I wasn't being paid enough for this."
