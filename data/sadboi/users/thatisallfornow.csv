Hypersexuality and drugs..., right with you there. All of these are pointers that the medication isn't holding your mood, and that needs addressing first, and it will help you the most.

Hypersexuality is a symptom, and the one that's least understood, talked about or accepted. For many it comes as a package deal when they're not of sound judgement to say the least. It's not just ""ooh I feel horny I'll fuck someone else"".

When depressed more light can help some, socialising, exercising, doing things they love more - even if it's binge watching series with a treat. It depends upon severity. Hugs always help.

For hypo/mania, less socialising, more sleep (meds), distraction (mainly for your sanity), relaxation (book plus music - music can often distract me), a separate bank account with a limit for them to spree with if that's a problem.

I think right meds are 80% of the answer for straight bipolar, and self regulation and awareness the other 20% - watching for symptoms and proactively upping doses/keeping healthy/finding triggers like stress or certain meds and reducing them.

Also lithium did nothing for my manias either but really helped reduce my depressions. The way your story reads I assume the happy> doing things> telling you how amazing you are  could be the hypomania starting - then throwing anger in as it progresses/becomes dysphoric, then getting more manic recently because of meds (or even despite them maybe).

I've said some really really awful things to my wife that have left her speechless over the years. I've generally forgotten most of them (my manic memory is hazy at best), but she hasn't.

I'm bipolar 1 and have been given low/0 points a couple of times, overturned later before arbitration. They make it so difficult, and it's so stressful, and rather kafka-esque. There's such a long period of worry attached to it all for most. Considering everyone going there has doctor/consultant notes, and many have disorders that don't suddenly get better, it's a terrible system. It's actually the benefit least likely to be fraudulent according to their own studies, I think only 0.5%"
DWPhelp,fee5q3w,t3_eod32t,1579026946.0,"Just be ready to explain whatever info didn't get across the first time - why you should get more points than were shown in the assessment reply in each section . It's a good idea to know how each question's points are awarded/what for. 

It's not like an assessment. My son has severe autism but got no points once, it was overturned whilst we were waiting to be seen, they only called us in to let us know. It was more personal and more relaxed in our case.

Take someone who helps with benefits (local disability related charities sometimes have someone), or just a loved one for support if they'll help your case.

There's a 70% chance of it being overturned, which are good odds, good luck."

BipolarSOs,f8o5d4m,t3_e1b13n,1574663518.0,"Sorry for what you've both been through, it's been a rough year.

1. Not always but very often. There's a list of symptoms or behaviours to look out for to see if people are hypomanic/manic. Each episode seems to have its own mix of them. Hypersexuality is one of them. Overwhelming urges, no real thought to consequences, change in tastes/interest/kinks, change in sexuality. I'm straight but some guys look hot when manic, Ryan Reynolds all the time for some reason. Hypersexuality's a symptom seldom discussed, even by psychs, and causes so many problems and can ruin relationships. 

2. For supporting him, I can only suggest; meds (learning about the main types for bipolar, and drugs to avoid that can send him manic), symptoms to watch out for (depressive/hypomanic/manic symptoms like grandiosity/sprees/hypersexuality/rage/sudden hobbies or obsessions, etc), a mood diary app (I use emoods, there are many) to see his sleep and mood changes as a graph and catch it early (low sleep could be hypomania/high amount, depression), you find out what his possible triggers are with the mood diary app from what you did on particular days and how your moods reacted - mine's stress mainly. You can also how effective drugs are - that's what helped me decide to take the medicines - I could see them working/not working by checking the graph and seeing if the graphs got better.
Getting diagnosed and accepting either the disorder or the medication took me a looong time, as did finding the right medication/combo, but medication is THE main key to staying well. 
Exercise and interests can help with reducing stress and staying well, if not overdone.
It sounds like he was on depakote/sodium vaproate after the lithium.

3.
The medication is for your sake as well as his, and it's been the biggest help to my wife out of anything. 
If possible have a contingency plan for catching things early, like extra medication. It takes a while to get to long term stability from diagnosis. I'm on lithium and depakote, and it's rough at first (lithium especially) but they get easier for many. There are other drugs, but they're less fun imo.
I'm in the uk so I'm not sure what help is out there, sorry, wish I could help with that. There's probably NAMI. I'm sure others here will be able to point you somewhere."

BipolarSOs,f4km1mf,t3_dkvdl0,1571654165.0,"Hi. Ultimately its down to her to take her tablets, but it may be worth discussing why she doesn't want to take them - is it side effects, is it one in particular, is it because she hopes for a manic high? Medication is key for dealing with bipolar. Nobody likes bp meds, they are all differing degrees of awful - they generally make you fat, tired, not as sharp witted, even before adding medical side effect risks. That said, some are better than others for particular people and it may be one med she hates that can be swapped out - or they can be changed completely.

As far as other self help goes, she could do a mood diary - I use emoods on android but there are others. It lets her see how her symptoms are changing and makes it easier to see if your going the depressed or hypo/manic route.
It maps symptoms and you can add others that are common. It also tracks sleep because it's a big indicator in many - no/little sleep means hypo/mania, more sleep may be depression.
Sometimes triggers can bring on mood changes. The most common are stress, poor sleep/jet lag, etc. It's worth knowing what hers are, and a mood diary with events can help. It can also help remind you to take/log meds and see if they/new-ones are helping.

Learning depressed/hypo/manic symptoms might help you out too, plus learning about the main bipolar drug types/what to avoid - bp antidepressants (and why normal ones are bad in bp), mood stabilizers, antimanics and antipsychotics - at the very least the ones she's on. Knowing symptoms let's you know what you're dealing with, and what you might have to deal with in the future.

I hate my meds, it's common, and I even don't take one - but my others keep me fairly sane without compromising employment in things, and I enjoy that. The one I don't take (unless I'm ill) makes me feel like crap, and most people would probably not take them if they didn't believe they really needed them. They may be alternatives for your wife's that are bearable for her. It took me a looooong time to come to terms with the fact I need to take something for the rest of my life to stay well, and as long to realise I do/achieve more medicated."
