EOOD,fe6jpe5,t3_enxyoj,1578893113.0,"Lots of great suggestions here, but I’m just going to throw out little nuggets that have worked for me :) they are simple and silly... but all helped me at one point or another when I was in a dark place

If you like the outdoors/hiking, find an uphill hike and walk up.  Then, pop in an earbud (obviously be careful), listen to a majestic and triumphant playlist, and RUN down... feels like flying

I know you mentioned cash is tight, but one totally superficial thing that can be a butt kick is to get some fun running clothes. Thrift stores are often great!!!

Find a podcast that REALLY clicks with you. I’m not sure what your interests are, but there’s tons of great recommendations on Reddit.  Spend a little time making playlists.  

If you live somewhere warm (or you’re just reeeaally gutsy) jump in a body of water immediately after sprinting the end of your run...

Other random ideas: borrow a friend or a dog for your run, run in different places (it always amazes me how much a difference this makes... although I guess it’s kind of common sense now that I think about it), register for any kind of race, use Strava or another app to track your runs. 
That’s all I can think of now.  Sorry for the novel.
Sending you love on your journey!"
