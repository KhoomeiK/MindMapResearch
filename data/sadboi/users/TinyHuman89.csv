A human child is what makes a parent a parent (whether by birth or adoption or fostering).

Before having my child, I was not celebrated as being a mother and I never would have dreamed of asking anyone to. It's not Women's Day. Thinking that having pets makes you a parent is more than a little silly. I've had pets of all sorts from near birth to death and it is barely comparable to having a human child.

wedding,fpobrhk,t3_gemrpp,1588781808.0,"We did this very backwards. We were supposed to move halfway across the country in late January/early February. Most of my family and friends aren't able to travel, so we had a commitment ceremony in December with my friends and family. We did it because it would break some of my family's hearts if they weren't there when we got married and my best friends were insistent that we have a wedding in California with all of them. My friends put together almost the entire ceremony and reception for about 50 people and we did it for probably around 6 or 7k. It was all held in one of my best friend's mom's backyard and house. We bought  fake flowers from craft stores to make the centerpieces. We bought fabric ourselves to make the runners and the arch decorations. Food was bought from a local restaurant. Tables and chairs were rented. One of my best friends officiated and another good friend was our photographer (we did pay her). It was livestreamed to my bedridden sick mother by another friend. I think the most expensive thing was my dress. We didn't have a DJ or dance floor as we just played a playlist I made. 

We ended up moving in early March due to it taking my husband longer to get out of the Navy than we thought. Then the Covid-19 lockdowns happened right as we were moving and we left California just before it closed and got to Michigan just before it closed. We weren't sure if we could get a marriage license due to the courthouse being closed and some websites said you couldn't get the marriage online. Well, after being her a month, I sent all our paperwork online and they mailed our license to us. It took us a couple weeks to organize and make sure we could do it, but we got everything together and had a tiny legal ceremony today. It was just us, our toddler daughter, our officiant, our two witnesses. We observed social distancing and wore masks. It was about 5 minutes and then we all signed the paperwork and left. 

I have been very lucky with the whole process. I now get to call my partner my husband and I couldn't be happier to be his wife."

We're a heterosexual couple. We had our whole wedding thing backwards. We had a commitment ceremony in December with my friends and family in my home state because most of them can't travel.

You already said there were other nails in the coffin, so if this is the final one (and why would you ignore the other nails), then split. I do not suggest getting married any time soon until you can address your issues in the relationship. At this point, if you're making a huge deal out of this and don't want to know more, it seems like your mind is set. 

There's plenty of options for men. I actually mean it was literally the same outfit. It's not the end of the world. It didn't make me love our ceremony, him, or us any less."

Because in the end, he's with me for better or for worse.

But like a previous comment has said, he probably doesn't have the same attachment to it that you think he does. He knows it's a venue that is budget-friendly that does beautiful weddings. He probably agreed to it knowing it is in your price range and could give you the wedding you want want. You said he eyed it with her. That leads me to believe that he didn't book it. And likely your (yours and hers) styles are likely very different. He's not replacing her with you. He's creating a new dream with you in it. 

One thing sticks out to me. You view his being engaged before as a very negative thing. As if he should feel guilty for it. You think that you should be the only one in his life that he should have ever been engaged to. But he's with you now. He chose you. And you're holding on to the fact he was engaged before like he has committed a crime.

If you aren't seeing a therapist either alone or together, you probably should. I think there are deeper issues here that should be addressed before you get married. It's seems you're making a mountain out of a molehill."

What made me angry was he saw what heroin did to him and he quit, just to get into snorting coke. I tolerated it because we both knew the relationship wasn't a real thing. But I wish I hadn't tolerated it. 

If I found out my fiancé was doing anything more than the occasional time he partakes in weed, I'd be done. All the other illegal substances are a hard no. I don't care whether it's coke, heroin, meth, etc. It's a complete deal breaker and it would end my relationship. 

Coke is a hard drug. And it's often cut with so many different substances now that makes it more dangerous than it already is. He kept this from you because he knew it was make you upset.

I narrowed it down to 3 and my fiancé picked it out. I like the delicate look to the wedding band. I chose the engagement ring on my own so I wanted his input for the wedding band. I love them both so much."
weddingplanning,fo39yv2,t3_g4w9s1,1587483268.0,This is my set.  [Ring Set](https://imgur.com/a/sxvu5Sc). The engagement ring is platinum plated silver with Moissanite. The wedding band is white gold with diamonds. I got both off of Amazon and were fairly cheap and I love both.
DoesAnybodyElse,fo3008c,t1_fo2z9xv,1587477879.0,"Thank you. I guess I used to have constipation issues. I didn't think of it as constipation because I just wasn't a person who pooped frequently. I didn't have problems going when I needed to; it was just not an everyday thing. 

But yeah...I probably should see a doctor. I should have a long time ago. I will admit that it definitely is something I don't want to experience it ever again and when it happens I go into a state of dread. But I'm glad it's only a couple times a year instead of frequently."
DoesAnybodyElse,fo2xe98,t1_fo2wu17,1587476317.0,"I'm a woman, but period poops have nothing on these. Mostly for me, period poops just make me feel like I need to poop often, but there's no pain. 

It doesn't matter whether I'm on meds or not, it just happens. It's been happening for over a decade. It's just like a pain build up to what eventually turns into diarrhea. I don't think constipation is a side effect of my current psych meds and I've only been on them a couple years."
DoesAnybodyElse,fo2untp,t1_fo21r85,1587474515.0,"I hope I find a doctor to deal with it. It's just hard because it happens so infrequently that I can't just show up and present my case. Diverticulitis runs in the female side of my family, but the CT scan that the hospital did in February said everything looks completely healthy."
DoesAnybodyElse,fo2uicl,t1_fo2nxrl,1587474410.0,It's absolutely miserable. I don't wish it upon my worst enemy.
DoesAnybodyElse,fo2udim,t1_fo24ejn,1587474317.0,I doubt it. I don't come in contact with any toxic metals. At least not that I'm aware of and it happens no matter where I live or work.
DoesAnybodyElse,fo1yajw,t1_fo1xe1j,1587444451.0,"I think it is poop shifting around in my intestines, but this lasts for anywhere between 2-8 hours of agony before I feel like my insides explode out of my poor butthole, usually more than once. Usually after that I feel better, but while the pain happens I can barely think. The pain subsides, but I feel exhausted afterwards. It only happens every 6 months or so, but I wish it didn't happen at all. Maybe I should see a doctor about it. The digestion process sucks sometimes. It's annoying from feeling nausea or heartburn to explosive diarrhea. 

I love a good pun and that was a good one, intentional or not. I hope your digestive issues go away too as they're not fun at all."
DoesAnybodyElse,fo1oeyu,t1_fo1nyyd,1587437775.0,Nope. I'll be passing gas just fine the entire time. Gas pains feel different to me and don't make me feel like passing out. I think it'd be easier if it was just gas. But I know gas pains can be absolute misery. My dad had it happen once and my mom said he thought he was dying.
DoesAnybodyElse,fo1lzx6,t1_fo1hso4,1587436225.0,"When this happened towards the end of February, I actually did go to the ER because the excruciating agony would not stop and I was worried I had appendicitis. It took a dose of morphine to get a small amount of relief to where I wasn't crying out of pain. 

It happened to me again over the weekend. And I hate it. It happens every 6 months or so (and has been happening for over a decade), but I can't figure out the cause since it's so infrequent. I just call it an intestinal cleanse."
DoesAnybodyElse,fo1l4xo,t1_fo1fqtr,1587435674.0,"The heart racing is probably almost as bad as the pain. Thank goodness I discovered that cold water on my hand or foot (or if I can splash it on my face) keeps me from completely passing out. 

When I'm finally done emptying my intestines, I feel a mixture of relief and exhaustion."
DoesAnybodyElse,fo0ygzp,t3_g4wint,1587422172.0,"Yes. 

A few times a year, I get intestinal pain that will make me pass out if I don't get cold water running over my hand or something. Chills, sweating, shaking. Worst pain ever, Pain level 12/10. It lasts HOURS. 

During that time I have to strip everything off while I try to poop. Clothes have to go. Rings have to be taken off. Necklace removed. Earrings out. Hair has to go up as loosely as possible to get it off my skin. It feels like every nerve in my skin is extremely sensitive and I must remove everything in contact with it.

I know I'm not alone in doing this, but it's still embarrassing."
AskReddit,fo0paul,t3_g4uku1,1587417259.0,"My brother has always been the Golden child. 

These are just some of the times they showed favoritism. For the ones that deal with money, let me just mention that for most of my life, we were pretty poor. If my grandparents hadn't supported us through some times, we would have been homeless and hungry many times over. 

1. When I was 12 or 13, my parents bought my brother a Razor Scooter when those were all the rage. I had to work all summer doing chores and helping out at my best friend's house to try to save up for one. Making $5 a week. I think I saved up about $50 towards the end of summer before my Aunt (who I admit favors me) paid for the rest. But summer was over so all the time for scooting around was gone. 

2. My brother loved soccer. My mom pressured me into playing as well. I ended up enjoying it, but having to stop playing after two seasons because my brother was good enough to join a kids soccer club and that was more important than me continuing to play. I think I went back after a year and I never reacquired the skills that I had lost. 

3.  I was on my high school's swim team. I wasn't great but swimming was the one sport that I could do with relative ease. My parents rarely made it to an away meet. The away meets were just too far away (despite being other local schools). However my mom went to every soccer game my brother played. Even if it was far away. We'd driven hours just for a game of his, but driving 15 minutes to my swim meet was just too far. 

4. My brother got a PS2 for his birthday right after they were released. They made me wait until the GameCube had gone waaaayyyy down in price before they got it for me. 

5. I was required to have a summer job when I was 17. Not a big deal and it was over before the school year started. Then I was required to have a job before I graduated high school. I do thank them for it because it instilled a good work ethic in me. My brother, however, was not required to have one. And he went out and partied before high school graduation. If I had done that, they would have lost their minds. He didn't have a job until he graduated college (and I'm super proud of him for that). I paid for my own prom ticket, grad night ticket, and yearbook that year. I don't think my brother ever paid for anything aside for lunch (which he always got money for it before I did) his entire high school career. 

My mom admits that my brother is my dad's favorite. She won't ever admit that he's her favorite though. They've gotten better as we've gotten older, though it's harder to play favorites when we're both independent adults. Plus they're thankful I was around when my mom had life-saving surgery and helped without having to be asked. I think the only time my mother ever picked me over my brother was after they discovered I was pregnant. My brother stormed into her room and basically told her it was either him or me and the baby. She told him that if he had a problem, he could just find another place to live. There wasn't a problem after that. He's also gotten much more bearable as he's gotten older as well. Slightly less entitled."

Probably more video games as well."
weddingplanning,fnzrkux,t3_g4j7pi,1587399509.0,"Personally, I wouldn't want to get married on my birthday. Technically we decided to be a couple on the evening of my birthday, but announced it to everyone else the next day so we go with that as our official anniversary. Birthdays mean a lot to me, even if I don't do much (I try to do something every year, but don't always get to). I know it sounds selfish, but I don't want to share my birthday with my anniversary. Plus I don't want him to feel as if he has to do extra just because it's both occasions on the same day. 

But if your fiancé has no problem with it, go for it. It all comes down to what you both want and if he's okay with it, go for it."
weddingplanning,fnzmjo9,t3_g4fnps,1587396904.0,It's so pretty. It matches your engagement ring perfectly.
tifu,fnw9axe,t1_fnw92vo,1587313988.0,"That's smart. I've never thought of it that way, but I also didn't know 911 called back (I've never called 911 before)."

tifu,fnw41vq,t3_g484jw,1587311005.0,"A similar thing happened to my fiancé the other night. He somehow happened to hold the power button on his phone too long and it called 911 without us knowing. All of a sudden it was making a siren tone for the SOS and he hung up right as they picked up. They called back and he had to explain that his phone called 911 on accident and that there was nothing wrong. I'm glad to know the SOS feature works, but he was embarrassed."
sex,fntdsz7,t3_g3q68d,1587239646.0,A no is a no. It sounds like he doesn't respect your boundaries. You said you don't want it and don't enjoy it and that should be the end of that conversation. Be firm when telling him no and don't give in if he keeps asking. He should be able to respect you and your boundaries.
sex,fntco73,t3_g3jhhg,1587239005.0,"Nope. I've never come at the same time as a partner. Close, maybe, but not at the same time."

AskReddit,fn9vbw3,t3_g0569i,1586785420.0,"My ex dumped me because he was ashamed of me (for being similar to him) and to please his family.

His family hated me because I'm not Christian, not university educated, and didn't work a fancy job for most of the time we were together. 

My ex also wasn't Christian, university educated, and didn't work a fancy job most of the time we dated. After his brother married his sister-in-law and he started hanging out with them (middle to upper middle class), he began to act like our lifestyle wasn't good enough for him. 

I was devastated for a long while, but now I look back and realize how stupid it all was. He was also emotionally abusive and manipulative so I dodged a bullet there."
trashy,fn36pmz,t1_fn23n66,1586614190.0,That's fine. California is super harsh about DUIs. Which is good because it should be more of an incentive to not drink and drive.

AskReddit,fmy5vp3,t3_fxw890,1586478784.0,"I met quite a few celebrities when I worked for an airline. I didn't really get to chat because I was supposed to look professional all the time. I really wish I had gotten some signatures though 

Gigi Hadid: Really sweet and nice. She checked in to the flight by herself (no handler) and was pleasant the entire check-in process, lots of luggage though, but less than I expected a model to have. 

Sebastian Stan: From observing him and boarding him on his flight, he seems like a nice guy. While waiting for his flight, he just sat in a chair near the gate listening to something on his phone instead of the usual hanging out in the ""VIP"" lounge. When boarding time came, he didn't rush to get onboard. He waited his turn and was polite to us scanning boarding passes. I was fangirling pretty hard and really, really wish I had asked for his signature at least. 

Hayley Duff: She was a mess. She grabbed the wrong MacBook from security and wanted us to hold the flight and find her MacBook. We couldn't do that and offered to let her off and book her on a later flight. She refused and she proceeded to bawl and told us to wait while she remotely wiped her MacBook.  We could not do that. My co-workers told me she was often demanding when she flew. I understand that the situation sucked, but we can't hold a flight for something like that. 

Debra Messing: She made me angry. We boarded wheelchairs and customers with severe disabilities first. She pushed her way in front of several wheelchair guests, demanding to be let on first because she was first class (and a frequent flyer). 

Elle Fanning: Met her several times. She was always nice and friendly. 

Jaden Smith: A pain in the butt. Had to be first on and first off the aircraft. Always had to have a handler do EVERYTHING for him. Didn't speak to anyone. 

George Hamilton: Super flirty and always pleasant. 

Kristin Chenowith: She's TINY. Very nice. She was also very patient. 

There's more that I've met, but those are the ones that stand out the most."
