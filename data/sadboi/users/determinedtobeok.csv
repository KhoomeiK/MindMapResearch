migraine,fj891ag,t3_fbsvj1,1583107862.0,I'll take that side effect please and thank you
cymbalta,fiyiyrr,t3_fahvfj,1582840318.0,"Yea. Cymbalta caused this for me too. I've been off it for just over 2 months and that side effect is gone. For me it happened at night time and I thought I could hear people taking outside my bedroom window and I kept thinking I could hear someone say my name right behind me but no one was there. My boss was alarmed thinking I needed my hearing checked.
Have a chat to your doctor about it to see if you're on the right medication."
cymbalta,fisxceq,t1_fiscptk,1582696197.0,"Sounds like a plan. Drinks loads of water too. Being dehydrated will make some side effects worse..... did for me anyway.

Good luck. Hope it works out!"
cymbalta,fis1jcg,t3_f9hcro,1582675686.0,"You could ask for a lower dose maybe and increase after you get used to it.
The experiences vary so don't stress too much.
It will take a while to get used to and if the side effects don't improve after a few days think about discussing another medication with you doctor.
I went better taking mine at night about 2 hours before bed with a snack. I found I slept and functioned better.
When I first started I got crazy angry really easily until I cut down coffee for the first month or so."
melbourne,fiiy6wn,t3_f7zcc1,1582429920.0,Possum tea now?
cymbalta,fi9jndb,t3_f76obo,1582268388.0,It helped me because it made me tired when I took it but by the time it got to bed time I was wide awake. Swapping to nights made sense for me. Test it on a weekend or some time you have no plans for the next day & see how you go.
GetMotivated,fi96kuh,t1_fi951di,1582256828.0,That is true. It is very materialistic and shallow.
migraine,fi8f6qh,t3_f6v8hn,1582239135.0,"I had a constant headache for 26 years. I stopped using steroid nasal spray (also used for 26 years) a few months ago. I'm happy to say the constant headache is gone and my migraines are shorter and easy way less severe.
Wish a doctor had suggested another nasal spray in all that time of specialist visits and wasting all that money."
cymbalta,fi6808h,t3_f6mjiv,1582182399.0,It's a common side effect. Mine was high all the time I took cymbalta. Keep getting it checked.

cymbalta,fhqijxx,t3_f4awz5,1581804805.0,"I was OK on 30 but upping to 60 was the biggest mistake I made. I will never trust a pain physician again for suggesting it. Put me into psychosis. Then weaning of 60 was horrible. But nearly 3 months later cymbalta free and feeling human and in control again.
Cymbalta should not give you a high. That's not what it's meant to do.
Like anything that messes with the chemicals in your brain, be cautious.
Saying all this, however, only about 60mg. Years ago I lost my father and needed help. I took. 30mg for 2 years with barely any side effects and when I forgot to take it for a week I just decided to stop. So 30 was not a problem for me 8 years ago.
But 60 really made my life suck."
cymbalta,fhomgc8,t3_f3yjcm,1581764734.0,Your wife is going through a rough time and is seeking help and your worried about how it may affect your sex life. Wow.

cymbalta,fh4ht6q,t3_f1cbyb,1581278811.0,"It will slowly get better after time. Took 2 to. 4 months for me. I tried to wean for a month until I went cold turkey. I had a complete meltdown getting off it but I'm glad I did. I was on it for 8 months and the idiot pain physician I had upped the dose when I told him they weren't working.
It will get better a tiny bit every day. Hang in there."
CRPS,ffzcmif,t3_evou7q,1580372369.0,I swear by pot. I got off all other meds. A shame it's illegal where I am but I'll take my chances for the relief.
cymbalta,ffw62ky,t3_evjln7,1580286021.0,"It's just time that will help. It took a good 2 months to get out of my system.
I forced myself to work out a lot to try and sweat it out lol
Try not to stress too much it will get better!

Edit; that directing to a wagon bit was directed myself to work out. Apologies on behalf of  auto correct."
cymbalta,ffv6d6p,t1_ffv4xee,1580256749.0,"I went to pain management for 20 weeks and it barely helped apart from the weight strengthening and exercise. I was put on so many drugs that were all awful.
I had a sex drive but the most pitiful climax so how frustrating is that for 8 months!
Nerve pain is so annoying because stress triggers it, temperature triggers it, a breeze triggers it and you just get over it. So to take something for that long that made me sweaty, nauseous, muscle spasms, headaches, brain zapa, body zaps, jaw pain, neck pain, digestive issues, blocked nose, insomnia, head fog and sd just made things worse for me. Plus the psychologist's just crap on about mindfulness and pacing so I actually feel better for doing meds. I'm in Aus too so weed isn't ready to get and not spruced yet for chronic pain because we're in the fkn dark ages. I've found though that it takes the edge off and your attitude to pain is not panic. But it kills lungs and it kills a lot of motivation."
cymbalta,ffv0cgg,t1_ffuz1ee,1580252805.0,"I was taking it for anxiety and nerve pain. It helped anxiety straight away but didn't last. Then I upped it. Biggest mistake for me. My brain was on overdrive and I was to aggressive and angry all the time for 3 months I tried weaning which felt like torture so I went cold turkey start of Dec. It has been a roller coaster. Unfortunately much worse than how I felt before. I now have depression too. But I think that's more about the lengths I have gone to to cure nerve pain and failing. So I found weed and I take no pharma medication. Again unfortunate that weed is illegal where I am. 
Everyone is different though and there are plenty of positive stories with this drug."
cymbalta,ffuy5jt,t3_evcqve,1580251578.0,"There are mouth guard for grinding you can get to wear at night. This may give you some relief. I also did had to keep stretching my jaw to relieve that clenching. For me the jaw issue was a constant problem but then I managed to suffer  every single side effect it would seem.
Good luck. Hope it works out well for you."
cymbalta,ffq2kum,t3_euhfjl,1580116919.0,"It's hard to tell what is 'normal', I had a pain physician tell me the same thing and it didn't go well. I went up to 60 and my world came crashing down pretty fast. Be cautious.

I am now free from cymbalta but it took me writing off my car because cymbalta caused so my aggression and anger that I felt everything was a race.

Well now I still have pain but I don't have a car which makes everything much. much worse. There may be another medication that works better but if you do continue on 60mg just make sure you're checking in wit yourself regularly to make sure things are improving."
cymbalta,fdt28m9,t3_emz7m2,1578710970.0,"Ride it out. The brain zaps fade away but I get one every now and again. But it was torture until I got rid of cymbalta all together. It's been a month and a half and I still feel like my brain is still recovering and returning to normal.. But everyone is different and I'm still very bitter about my experience with cymbalta this time. I weaned for a month and a bit until I got tired of drawing the process out.

Hope you're feeling better. It will get better every day.......gradually :)"
cymbalta,fdlqw0n,t3_em14f6,1578530345.0,You would expect improvements I'd think. At least feel like the potential for improvement was beginning. I'd have a chat to your prescriber to make sure it's right for you. Good luck.
cymbalta,fcvsv4t,t3_ej3c3a,1578009337.0,For me it was overwhelming coming off. I'm much happier for doing it but remember the first few weeks were pretty bad and I had migraines nausea brain zaps depression. Good luck! I wear blue light blocking glasses that I swear help with glare. Maybe they could help you?

cymbalta,fbx25cv,t3_eevrcw,1577166400.0,I'm having a similar but not so dramatic increase. I stopped 3 weeks ago and gained 5 kilos. I had a tough withdrawal though and seeing the scales scared me into a few cardio workouts lol
cymbalta,fblpljo,t3_edspqq,1576967019.0,Kind of but I'm just so glad it's coming out of my system. I'm expecting to be a bit fffed up while my brain readjusts. I'm 21 days cymbalta free today.
cymbalta,fblp3o4,t1_fb4926u,1576966658.0,They put me on it for nerve pain and adjustment disorder. Lol Much happier now I'm off it. Honestly it just amplified everything I was feeling. I didn't properly realise this until it came out of my system. Good luck.
cymbalta,fb2jvud,t3_eb1ivf,1576452391.0,It turned my hormones upside down and after upping the dose my cycles went crazy and like you sweats nausea and migraine when I ovulated. Way more intense pmt too. I began to not recognise myself. So I weaned off and have been cymbalta free for a couple of weeks. I think it's helped. There are other options you could discuss with your doc because I realise just coming off a med isn't everyone's cure.
cymbalta,fagmil7,t3_e91t2o,1576063055.0,Yeah. Totally messed with my cycle.

insomnia,f9ta8ym,t1_f9squls,1575614484.0,Lol I know right. Insomnia is a beast! You gotta tame it or release it somehow.
insomnia,f9sjgbw,t1_f9sixsl,1575593651.0,I get it. I used to use pot but alcohol makes my sleep worse. I'm not disciplined enough to use pot for sleep because....... I will smoke it all the time lol And yes keeping the routine up is difficult because... Life happens. I will swear by sweating and stretching though because it makes me feel better in general.
insomnia,f9sibh8,t1_f9sfdng,1575592985.0,I've many years experience with no sleep for so many different reasons. It's my little system I created from so many different insomnia 'cures' I've tried. Sometimes nothing helps.
insomnia,f9scqd5,t3_e6o42j,1575589835.0,"What works for me is after too many nights without sleep is doing a tough cardio workout to get rid of cortisol followed by pilates first thing. Then soaking in a bath listening to soft classical music then listening to guided relaxation.
I also start setting an alarm and getting up at the same time every day for a few weeks to reset.
P. S I'm hyper so I suffer from this a lot  but my strategy may not help you. It's hard and I hope you get some relief soon."
cymbalta,f97wnwf,t3_e47zfh,1575171196.0,"Sounds like a rough time. When are you going back to see the prescriber? You may want to try and see them asap to discuss the side effects. It is still early days with side effects but it sounds like cymbalta isn't a going too well for you.
I'm tapering off and it feels rough too."
cymbalta,f8worvx,t3_e2eh49,1574895907.0,"I had to take it at night. I get better sleep if I take it at night about an hour or so before bed. If I take it in the morning I feel like I'm in a haze for the whole day until bedtime where I've started gaining my clarity so I didn't get to sleep.
I also took 4mg melatonin for the first couple of weeks which helped. Taking antihistamines at night and forcing myself to get up at the same time every day helped too.
Hope you get some good sleep soon."
cymbalta,f8qe2hp,t1_f8qas82,1574716241.0,"The first time I stopoed cymbalta absolutely nothing happened except at day 5 I realised I'd forgotten to take them and didn't look back. I'd been on 30mg for a year or so. This time I went up to 60 for nerve pain. Have noticed nothing but side effects and this time I'm having trouble with withdrawal.  Maybe it's also because I don't have too much to distract myself with?

But if they're right for you don't worry."
cymbalta,f8qd8mp,t1_f8pq3nt,1574715864.0,Thought I was going crazy feeling like I'm coming down with a flu...... Thanks for sharing. Tapering off sucks!
cymbalta,f8fwcp9,t3_e0hj7u,1574550365.0,I hear you loud and clear. It's a game of timing. I find the best time is when I miss a dose and due for the next at the 48 hour mark. I've been taking cymbalta for about 6 months. Yet I'm finding that the fact I have to think about timing this aspect of my life a huge problem for me. Good luck. It will get better.
cymbalta,f8bye9w,t1_f8bjlzw,1574448194.0,"I'm tapering off but not because of that but other side effects l have decided to try and stop. I'm taking it for nerve pain. I've not noticed any improvement due to cymbalta so there's no point continuing to put up with all these side effects.
Initially it helped with anxiety and mood. I'm grateful for that but the negatives have outweighed the positives now and causing more issues. I can always start again if I'm wrong.
But 17 days is excessive and could be caused by something else like an imbalance. Hopefully you can get a doctor to make sure of that but I feel for you. Apart from everything else it's inconvenient to say the least.
Good luck. Keep us updated."
cymbalta,f8b98cj,t3_dyfkgj,1574430947.0,Tinnitus perhaps?
cymbalta,f8b8vhz,t3_dz4iho,1574430652.0,I know that feeling! The headaches get better with time. I can't recall how long it took but it was gradual over a month or so. And I make sure I drink lots of water.
cymbalta,f8b86ni,t1_f8ayp4a,1574430069.0,Yes. 8 days. Then it stopped for one to two weeks and started again. 7 days that lasted.
cymbalta,f8atxwl,t3_dzqjsb,1574411728.0,Yes. Cymbalta affects my hormones incredibly and when I increased from 30 to 60 brought heavier periods........because all the other side effects aren't enough lol

cymbalta,f0avzcv,t3_d4eakq,1568519516.0,"I'm in a similar position. I started on 30 maybe 4/5 months ago.
I felt after a couple of months the gains I'd noticed initially were gone but I was just left with the milder but still crappy side effects. So I doubled it and got a month I improved slightly but I'm back in the same slump and like you mentioned I've become increasingly more aggressive. I'll fire up easily & quite often it's an overreaction. Then I get so upset I get emotional and inconsolable.
I'm not sure whether I'm jumping to conclusions that cymbalta is to blame or if there's external stuff as well that's added too much pressure and I've become overwhelmed.
I was told when I increased last time that I may need to increase again up to 90.
But I also don't want to put myself on this emotional roller-coaster of increasing to fall in a heap again.
Funny thing is I took 30mg for nearly 2 years almost 8 years ago and didn't have half as many issues."

At first I got super motivated and worked out a lot, lost quite a bit of weight and are well. Then I got really sick with an infection, hash to take 3 courses off antibiotics and since then I've struggled a bit with motivation although I am still recovering.
