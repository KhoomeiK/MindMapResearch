getting_over_it,ew5zrez,t1_ew5yvec,1565149475.0,You were looking for two cents and didn't like what you got. You seemingly have all the answers anyway. So be brave and figure it out for yourself or ask real friends.

But hopefully you can find some inner strength to move on. Some people cannot. I hope you can make it work though."

getting_over_it,evat4t5,t3_cixwgr,1564356511.0,"Honestly, i think if it lasted that long you should have risked trying. It sounds like torture to have put yourself through that. Learn from it. The next time you have strong feelings, attempt a gesture and see if it's reciprocated."

I really never pursued art for work, but am a creative thinker still. I narrowed down my interest to just watercolor and can tweek out on that when feeling good, but that's rare. I'm only starting back into watercolor as a way to cope with stress."

Marriage,euovoik,t1_euolw4i,1563947591.0,"I tried. Since the abuse is not physical, I don't qualify. It is mental abuse. I see that now. He took advantage of my sorry state of mind. Calls himself a bottom feeder. And i was at a low state when we met. But I'm a good person. Or thought i was. Guess I'm not really."
ptsd,eunuocc,t3_cgzuoe,1563933758.0,"I didn't realize i grew up in a toxic household, and unleashed all my horribleness on others as a teenager. I was just a little girl who grew up with nasty brothers. And felt i had to defend myself. Unfortunately I am now a fucked up person in a bad relationship."
ptsd,eunu0xl,t3_cgzuoe,1563933508.0,Once you've gone through abuse i think you'll always be a target for more. Unless you get serious help early on
MentalHealthSupport,eumhhmo,t3_cgqagx,1563915775.0,"I know it feels good to break with the norm and ""be yourself"" but life will be difficult if you don't follow some rules. Everyone learn them.

depression,eully66,t3_cglb3p,1563903260.0,I feel on the outside of thingss because I'm so unhappy. But I'm working on accepting myself as is so others acceptance will feel welcome.
MentalHealthSupport,eullmq9,t3_cguaat,1563903070.0,"I know what you are feeling. I had to make up lies to satisfy a distant father. I still slip sometimes, out of pressure to please and seem better than i am, but it's totally not worth it.   It's a crushing feeling to have to become honest about yourself and your situation. But it  can only serve you better in the long run to get your head on straight. You'll feel better and do better."

CPTSD,eul258h,t3_cgqlrs,1563896022.0,I tried to do best by my awful mother. But i am a fool to have tried to care for so long. I did my best at her funeral. Which i now regret. But fuck all don't know what else to have done.
Marriage,eukhj3u,t1_eukg3ws,1563888418.0,I'm also afraid to reach out and to admit i made a terrible decision. I have no family and don't feel like i can trust people at this point.

mentalhealth,etqcbrv,t1_etq87ix,1563079523.0,All good advice. You have to learn to cope and take care of of your emotions. It's hard if you were never taught. But it's all anyone can do in this life. I wish i had known better sooner.

I feel challenged by trying to find something new to pursue. But not going to lie....relating and getting support here is helping. But you could take solace in the fact life in meaningless or you can find your own sense of meaning."
depression,etj2jql,t3_cbunaz,1562864935.0,"You are not depressed permanently. You need to breakdown your situation and start making small changes. Focus on doing things that will make you feel better. Exercise, music, art, etc. Once you get feeling better you will be able to see your situation better. You may try a new job or education. Depression comes and goes for some of us. Reach out to friends or family if you have them. Life is not always predictable and constant, and that can be seen as a good thing. Please, Don’t give up!!"
depression,etj1962,t1_ethxcgz,1562864199.0,Don’t panic. Just get a stupid job being something mindless for awhile. Just keep going. Your degree may be applicable in a different way. It’s best to get real world experience. A degree shows you were able to complete and commit something. It will be ok. You just can’t give up. Reach out to friends or family if you have them.
depression,etj0np8,t1_etidswx,1562863871.0,"Really, fu*k other people. They don’t matter. You have to be strong and have conviction you are doing what YOU need. Most people are complete waste of time and not worth being concerned about."
depression,etj0ft2,t1_etia6aj,1562863710.0,"I was stuck in mindless retail in my early twenties. But went back to school. Finally got a MS. It was going positively for a while, but I’ve hit another low. But you just got to keep trying. We are moving and I’ve got to find a new job. Don’t give up and don’t be lazy. Keep stretching, it’s part of what makes life interesting and fun if you are doing it right."
depression,etiqetr,t1_etgd227,1562857471.0,Sharing and relating to people used to be a natural thing society did. Encouraging the human spirit to go on with life.

depression,etios8u,t1_etimxed,1562856378.0,It’s a lot to deal with and can really put a damper on things when you realize it’s a problem.
depression,etiofht,t3_cbvznq,1562856128.0,"Life is very diverse. It isn’t just about love. It requires a lot to keep going. Find something that brings you joy, that wakes you up inside. (Not having power over friends/I think that’s just in your head). Do find someone you can trust to share your life with, because it brings comfort. Don’t give up so easily."
depression,etinym1,t3_cbsdrv,1562855763.0,Making little goals and accomplishing them can make a difference. Keep building your life up that way and depression will soon be in the past. Just don’t stop!!

It was just so sad, but at the same time there's nothing more i could do for her. I was wrapped up trying to be a good daughter for so long. Only now she's gone do i know for a fact that she was a narcissist, wish i had clarity so long ago, but i did know she was crazy."

MentalHealthSupport,etd5abh,t3_cayubk,1562699444.0,"I understand how hard it can be to function. But what she said was her way of wanting to help but not knowing how. If you can see that then i think you understand as adults we don't always know what to say or do. She's not trained in empathy. And she has no personal experience being that low. Take time to recover, journal, and take your meds. Keep trying."

MentalHealthSupport,etcd9et,t3_cb0qbo,1562682012.0,"Letting someone help is tricky. Because if you're not careful you can grow dependent on him. Don't let that happen. For depression: work on yourself. Eat better, exercise, (maybe change your location), and set good habits and intentions. If you so desire get some medication or talk to someone or both. Depression is really just a hard grip on the brain. But it can be broken."

mentalhealth,etbqipi,t3_cavvr3,1562657040.0,"It’s not normal. Sounds like you are experiencing some depression. It’s okay to be an introvert but the rest of what you described is not good. Medication can help. Wellbutrin is a mild antidepressant, then there is Zoloft and others. I think you should start by talking to a primary care doctor. Alternatively to medication or in combination with medication you could speak with a therapist. In my experience my depression is hereditary and brought on by bad environments or unhealthy people. I’ve taken Wellbutrin before and it helped. Also eating well and having an exercise routine helps. If you have family or friends that can be supportive, reach out. Take good care of yourself."
