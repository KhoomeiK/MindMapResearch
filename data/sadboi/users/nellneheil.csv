My dad works from home during the quarantine too. We live in the same house. It's my home as well as his. I keep quiet, knock when I need something from him and wait for him to let me in and always make sure I'm not loud when I'm near. Basic human decency. I definitely learned this as a kid because my dad used to work from home then too.


As many have said, your girlfriend seems to suck. I can't comment on her being unemployed because I don't know her life, but since I don't pay my full expenses as well (low paying job), I am respectful to people who pay for me especially while they're earning it. 


She does, sadly sound like a kid, which is weird, since I assume she isn't 5 years old. Most 5 year olds can understand ""I'm working, please be quiet"". Now that we have gathered she's worse than a child, it's probably not her being stupid but her being entitled and spoiled (who pays for her weed?) and if she can't respect YOU of all people, then she probably doesn't respect anyone. And yeah, you should probably dump her. That's what I'd do but also I'm not the most patient."

I could look past that but as some have mentioned he turned really self righteous, was mad when Clarke trusted Bellamy even though Bellamy had started changing and you know, took things seriously and respected Clarke.
And then he goes and massacres a village for Clarke whom he had known for what, a month? I get liking people and shit but Jesus, he acted like they were some soulmates and he would destroy the whole world for her. Bellamy on the other hand, while actually doing everything for Clarke, tried to find a better way than just murdering innocent people (not counting his Pike phase since that wasn't for Clarke).
It was pretty clear that the grounders didn't have a clue about her but Finn just lost it and murdered out of anger. Like dude, go punch a tree or something not...kill...people?
I get it that arkers didn't want one of them to die, but protecting a mass murderer was pretty stupid and I feel like the grounders were right about killing the guy - they only took one life for his massacre.
In conclusion, he seemed like a nice guy until we found out he had anger issues and a shitty method of coping with them."

 In an interview with [MTV](http://www.mtv.com/news/3162473/gi-dle-interview-oh-my-god-soyeon-i-trust/), Soyeon explained that the imagery in the music video represents love in its many forms, a notion made more powerful by the unexpected use of female pronoun — “She”.

The only male performers in the music video appear at the first scene dragging Minnie across a hallway representing societal pressures and expectations.

Soyeon cries out on the hook, while she writhes within a mass of bodies cloaked in white and tainted in black ink, symbolic of her homosexual love to be a sin.

Soyoen leaves the interpretation to the fans saying,

>I didn’t want to limit that ‘she’ to a certain being or a certain definition. So it’s open to anything. I believe that all kinds of love are valuable and must be respected. That’s why I don’t want to limit ‘she’ to something specific.

I'm literally dying. I'm bi and I never expected Gidle to do something like this.

Warning: like MAJOR SPOILERS ahead.

1. I see so many people misunderstand the difference between Polo and Lu. In case I was terribly wrong, Lu didn't even consider hurting Polo. First, she was really drunk, second she was fed up and she went in the bathroom to ask Polo to leave and let everyone finally have some rest. When Polo saw the bottle neck, he took it in his hand as well and I doubt Lu could've stabbed him even if she tried at this point, he's definitely stronger than her. Then he decided to provoke her, because that's a very smart move when you see someone clearly distressed holding a ""weapon"" in their hand and they don't really like you. Not saying he deserved to die for that as well but he definitely needed a brain scan because come on dude. And last - after Polo provoked her, Lu started to have a breakdown and we see her falling on Polo because she lost strength (if Polo hadn't been right in front of her, she'd have falled to the wall or on the floor or whatever was in front of her). She definitely forgot about the bottleneck she was holding and she wasn't thinking ""oh yeah I'm angry at this dude let's stab"" she was more like ""fuck he's right nobody loves me"". And then she stabbed him. And that was a really sad and distressing moment. Polo on the other hand got angry at Marina, he wanted to take the watch away by whatever means possible (well he didn't plan on killing her but no doubt he'd taken it away violently) and he literally picked up a heavy object with the intention of hitting her with it. There's a clear difference between those two situations.
2. The finale and them covering for Lu. God, I had literal chills. The moment where they all worked together, putting their differences, social class, wealth etc aside. I don't think it was a great thing. I don't even think it's the right thing to do. But in their situation would I have done something different? To be fair, I doubt it. The last scene showed the humanity of all these characters. That they're not perfect, they're human. If Lu had turned herself in, the Polo/Marina drama would have kept going for god knows how long.  Also, if she still had her parents on her side, she could've turned herself in and would probably had kind-of-actually-fair-treatment, not because the system is fair but because her parents have money. Since she was nothing now, god knows what would've happened. 

Moving on to the characters and plotlines and everything else that doesn't really concern the main drama.

* I was really happy that Omar got to go to the school in the end, be around his friends and get his family back. His stupid cheating plotline left a sour taste in my mouth. I would've felt a lot happier with his happy ending if he didn't turn out to be such a dick. Writers did him dirty. I do understand that it would be hard for him to be around Ander. Ander acted like a jerk (he did have a reason and I don't blame him) and the situation was definitely horribly depressing for Omar. But jesus christ I hated the cheating thing and I really really hated Malick! He felt nice at the beginning, I enjoyed him and Nadia because it seemed like an important plot point in her storyline - on one hand she had Guzman, who she really loved but who was from a different world and didn't make her parents happy and on the other hand - this muslim guy her parents loved, who understood her and her faith and taught her important things (I really liked the part ""we can't always be Allah's perfect children""). But him being gay and getting with her brother ruined his character and made everything else meaningless.
* Carla and Yeray. Poor, poor Carla. I felt the most for her out of all the characters. Her father is a terrible person. Manipulating and practically selling his daughter was disgusting and her having to deal with it and become totally depressed. The worst part was her mothers betrayal. Yeray was techinally a good dude, naive but not a bad person. I disliked how he didn't seem to take Carla's wished in account, for example, when he got her that dress and you could see she didn't want to wear it but he still guilttripped her. I think he should've noticed what was going on, and he DID but he never once decided to ask her ""okay I see you're unhappy, why is that? And by the way your father seems to force things upon you all the time, what's up with that?"". I don't condemn Carla appologising to him in the end but I do think that he should also have done that, since his blindness caused her a lot of pain. The end with him giving her the wineries was nice though and I'm happy he lowkey came to his senses.
* Rebe is too good for any of these characters, espcially Samuel. I do understand why he did what he did. He prioritised his family over a girl who, yes, was his friend but also a stranger and not his blood. Was it the right thing? Probably not. Was it a very human thing to do? Yeah. She is still too good and nobody deserves her. My favorite scene was when the gang stood up to her.
* Nadia and her family. God, I cheered for all of this so damn hard! Nadia has grown so much, het putting her foot down and being honest with her parents was amazing and her parents finally comming to their sense was great as well. I generally had 0 problems with her and her storyline. Love her. 
* Lu - the same as with Nadia. I really hated her S1 and didn't like her much S2 but S3 was her best season, she's grown a lot. Her friendship with Nadia is beautiful and her being a feminist - but not choking this down our throats - was beautiful and well done and ugh.... Yes. I love her a lot.
* Cayetana, Polo and Valerio. - I don't like any of them. As many have said, Cayetana's ending was out of character, she should've taken the university offer. Especially because nobody would've helped her after that, so she'd have to come to terms with her poorness anyway. Polo is a dick because even though he did kill Marina by accident, it took him three seasons to decide in the last episode he'd have to turn himself in??? Dude what the fuck, have some remorse. Valerio is just. Eh. I like how he had his nice moments when he was decent but... Not my favorite character. Besides that, their polyamorous thing was fucking amazing! I don't really like that they made the worst (subjectively?) characters be poly, since it leaves a bit of ""oh they're evil that's why they're poly"" taste in my mouth but I love the representation poly folks got. Also it seemed logical since Polo had obviously been poly for a long time. So yes, more poly representation in the world, please!
* On the Valerio note - okay maybe Sandra did what she did to be a good person and keep a kid away from drugs. That scene was still incredibly disgusting and wrong to me. How a grown woman can use a kid (even if he's 19, still a kid) even if she doesn't want to go all the way. I don't understand why no one is adressing that.
* The end was pretty nice. I'm sad about Samu and Carla but there was the theory that since they filmed S2 and S3 back to back, they didn't expect fans to love their ship so much so they didn't film a good ending. Even though I ship them a lot! I like that they didn't cancel the pairing completely but left it open. After all, studying abroad and the other person staying home is a very natural thing to happen. And also not being together with your senior crush. If they're a good pairing then they will work out when Carla finishes studies or Samu moves to her - they'll find a way. Similar to Nadia and Guzman's ending. It was sweet and they seem to really be endgame and I'm glad they were true to each other. Maybe Guzman will graduate and move to New York as well, he certainly has the funds. Lu and Rebe being alone/with no pairing in the end was great and powerful. Also did you remember Rebe hinting she was bi? Yeah that, give her a girlfriend you cowards. Lu leaving with Nadia was great. No comments on Omander because again, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
* Also the whole cancer plotline! Might not have been great but I love how they portrayed Ander's depression and giving up and then deciding to live again. Nice and realistic.

In general, I loved this season, it seemed to be almost perfect (and definitely realistic unlike a lot of teen shows!!!) and I cried like a baby for the last half of the episode."
