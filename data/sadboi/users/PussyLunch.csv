ghostoftsushima,fqy1uwa,t1_fqxrnrt,1589741232.0,"Except theyâ€™ve said the story revolves around Jin learning new tactics to fight the mongols. He gets his ass kicked fighting the samurai way, so he learns ghost techniques. Weâ€™ve even seen in the story that his master disapproves of what he is doing. What Iâ€™m not saying is that you canâ€™t play a certain way, I just think that story wise youâ€™re going to learn ghost tactics but then youâ€™ll get to decide if you continue to fight using those tactics. 

Now based off my previous paragraph, getting your ass kicked is guaranteed and you will somehow learn the ghost techniques. However, maybe the scene with your master changes based on your play style. But that seems too early for the gameplay to to affect the story, so Iâ€™d like to think thatâ€™s still the game introducing you to the ghost mechanics. 

One thing is for certain though, Iâ€™m positive based on the allies you meet, you will only be able to progress quest lines if you play that style. Now Iâ€™m not saying you get locked out of missions, rather the quest itself has you play as the ghost or samurai.

The real question people should be asking is how much of the style you want to play will you be able to stick to throughout the story because surely itâ€™s going to be a mix... which is back to OPs original point, people are over thinking it."
