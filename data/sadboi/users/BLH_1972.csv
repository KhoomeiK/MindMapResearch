Try to connect with people that like you and are kind to you. Bad attention IS NOT better than no attention. Better yet work on not needing this attention. Look up DBT on YouTube.
BipolarReddit,fptinfy,t3_gfawvp,1588891955.0,This is rough. I suggest getting in touch with NAMI.  They teach you how to help and cope with your own feelings and take care of yourself while being a partner to someone with these illnesses. They actually have a whole (free) class for you. Please take care of you while loving her. That is an especially difficult combination of illnesses. I know because I have both.
