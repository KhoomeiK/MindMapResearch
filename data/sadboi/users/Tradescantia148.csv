Gossiping. I heard people gossip about patients (me including) and they were saying the nastiest stuff, and that about teens who were mentally ill, and depended on these people to care for them! whenever I catch myself making fun of someone, I get this sense of shame"

I said ""hi"" to them as if I had never been gone. the funny thing is, no one has even bothered to ask where I have been, do they really care that little about other people? jeez"
DoesAnybodyElse,fdv87le,t3_emo432,1578744423.0,no. spoiling art is such a disrespect to its creator and if anyone spoils something for me I will not forgive them for it.

DoesAnybodyElse,fdv5vd2,t3_en3u98,1578743615.0,"totally. especially my brother does this. He has these fixed passions for like a few weeks and buys hella stuff for it thinking that makes it easier and better or whatever. F.E iceskating, photography, other sports, school. he makes a habit of blaming it on not having stuff instead of just using the shit you already have! 

example: photography. i want to make photos but I dont have a camera. \*buys camera\* not good enough of a camera \*buys more\*. its a never ending cycle."
DoesAnybodyElse,fdv5d3b,t3_en5teh,1578743371.0,"when I was depressed I noticed it was to get out of it because I didn't want anything else than being depressed. I thought happiness was fake and doesn't exist and I was so suicidal that I didn't even want to bother getting out of my depression because that would mean all my problems needed fixing and stressed me out so.. 

not sure if that's what you mean but in a way I was addicted to neglecting all other feelings etc."
