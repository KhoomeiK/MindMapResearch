emetophobia,fqpoygt,t3_gk97fz,1589551207.0,i’ve taken Plan B and had no issue. try to take it and forget u did. eat a small meal or snack before. drink a glass of water. take it easy while also getting distracted. you got this!
emetophobia,fqfkkpl,t3_gikv5x,1589326570.0,i actually gag every time i brush my teeth (while i’m brushing my tongue). i couldn’t imagine v*ing from doing that though!!! wtf?!
NatureIsFuckingLit,fq51exi,t3_ggm1nd,1589089574.0,celebrities!! they’re just like us!!
emetophobia,fplmbf1,t3_ge3lg4,1588715300.0,OMG I LOVE YOU!!! thank you for your story and your positivity. <3
emetophobia,fpfcc7o,t3_gcxdyj,1588567177.0,"i am so happy you’re here. what a relief. you are NOT alone and you, me, and all of us - we will get through this. <3"
relationship_advice,fpdr8rn,t1_fpdki9c,1588532614.0,this was where i started to lose it!!!!!!!!!
relationship_advice,fpdr4ba,t3_gcmq39,1588532543.0,honestly this made me tear up😂 I’m such a baby!!! I’m glad you could both come to an understanding. i absolutely understand both sides. it really does sound like u found the one. <3
relationship_advice,fpdqn1y,t3_gctlyn,1588532268.0,you deserve a life filled with love and light! so glad you know what’s best for you. it’s hard to move on but i know you can do it. and remember not to blame yourself. you’re amazing! <3
unpopularopinion,fpczsp1,t3_gc6gq0,1588516722.0,i 100% agree. i can’t wait to not have kids at my wedding. fuck that. and i bet the parents would thank me too!! a whole night without having to make sure one of them hasn’t fallen in a toilet or gotten lost? while also drinking?
unpopularopinion,fpcyp8n,t3_gco02x,1588516017.0,"this might sound weird, but i’ve got a family friend (Kim) who knows a lot of celebrities. idk, since she was young she did everything she could to marry celebrities and be in their friend groups. usually accomplished by stalking. weird lady, but she’s had a hell of a life and the BEST stories. 

Kim knew Ellen for a period of time. she was in a lesbian-girl hangout group with her. idk what else to call it 😂. she was in the group for a few months. ellen was a bit of a dick but everyone accepted that, she was kinda in charge. people would fluctuate in and out of the group according to ellens wants. Kim said that it felt good when Ellen liked her. 


Kim mentioned a story where Ellen once dumped her girlfriend by leaving her in her house and a note, telling the woman to move out by the end of the day, because it just didn’t work out. i think they were dating for awhile too!! pretty cold. anyway, Kim got kicked out of the group a few months later when Ellen found out she was not, infact, a lesbian. i wonder if Kim pretended to be or if it wasn’t mentioned. i can’t imagine a group of lesbians not talking about how they’re lesbians... maybe she flew by as Bi? 


not the craziest shit, but cool to get an in on her life back then, when she was like, queen of the lesbians. i wish i could remember more details about the story. if you’ve got any questions you can ask me and I’ll text Kim and ask her. i don’t like using her for her stories but i will if i have to!!!! (Kim is not her real name) 😂

EDIT: i really got on my soap box and forgot to tell u the point of the story. Ellen was only interested in people she could sleep with. when she got tired of them they were gone. when they were too much work they were gone. when she found
out they def aren’t lesbian - gone. she was a dick to people who liked her. and who could say she even liked them. it was when Kim told that story when i thought... damn, Ellen is kinda a sleezy bitch. and a bit of a predator."
emetophobia,fp66ni4,t3_gbdbas,1588347037.0,oh my god😂😭OF COURSE!!!
emetophobia,fp2tlvo,t1_fopzezv,1588267672.0,"hey there - i’m remembering this post from the other day and needing it now. i took too much benadryl last night (but an amount i’ve taken before), 75mg, and had the worst night. i was shaking uncontrollably, couldn’t see right, mouth super dry, low blood pressure, and just all around didn’t feel right. i woke up today in a pool of sweat and i feel severely dehydrated. i’m trying to drink plenty of fluids but i’m not feeling much better. any advice? will this pass soon? my brother who is a nurse said that the benadryl is leaving my system."
relationship_advice,fp11daq,t3_gafjh8,1588221821.0,"i think this is a very hopeful situation. your boyfriend seems to be caring and understanding about this, and you seem to be aware and working on this! you even picked up hobbies - that’s awesome!! i think making friends, joining community or school clubs, and going to therapy would be great too. idk what your insurance situation is but you can find therapists within your network on Psychology Today or there are other resources to get lower-cost therapy. message me if you need any assistance! proud of u. things will continue to be good :)"
funny,fp0z98b,t3_gablzl,1588220353.0,gladly!!
emetophobia,fox0nzj,t1_fowvq9y,1588131292.0,"aw thank u so much for this sweet message!! i really wanna let go on my birthday and just enjoy and celebrate. i’ll try to take these words into every day and accept that what happens will happen. the countless nights i’ve spent panicked it’s going to happen and it hasn’t ... it saddens me. like any typical phobia - if it happens, you will survive (unless it’s deadly ofc😂). i don’t wanna live like this anymore so i’m excited to try and move on and leave a lot of my anxiety in the past in my 21st year. :) i think anxiety will always be with me but hopefully i can learn to use it as a helpful tool instead of a crippling burden. i wish only the best for you! <3 mel"
emetophobia,fowueth,t1_fowojda,1588127370.0,i love it!! thanks so much :))
emetophobia,fot96wn,t3_g9d41f,1588047597.0,"omg thanks y’all. !! i am planning on doing mimosas (champagne), margaritas (tequila), and then white wine :) maybe a shot or two of tequila for funzies. i don’t wanna mix any other alcohols. i’ll take my time and have fun. i think i’ll be asleep by 10 lol. i’ve never even drank all day!! but i’m excited :)"
emetophobia,fosn5et,t1_foricw0,1588034014.0,"im really excited actually! my boyfriend and his siblings are planning a bunch of stuff for me which is so cute. the first thing i want when i wake up is a mimosa - i love champagne! i would like to get drunk (lol) and drink more than usual, but i am weary about feeling ill that night or next day. i need some all day drinking tips!! i’ll make a post :)) i have a good feeling about this bday."
emetophobia,for8yem,t3_g8wb1d,1588008194.0,7 days from being 21 :)
emetophobia,fodtv4n,t3_g6psyr,1587690022.0,i like to always have a cliff bar or filling snack near buy incase the hunger/nausea shows up and i don’t have a meal ready or available. it takes practice but when im out and about (which isn’t the case right now) having my granola bars or snack bars is my safety net. prevents the hunger from turning into nausea or nausea from getting worse. :)
tifu,fo17evk,t3_g2vx9u,1587427275.0,"i would’ve damn near died if this happened to me. your strength and humor is amazing. im so sorry for your suffering but i know you’ll be better soon. by far my fav post on reddit. beautifully written! much love, stay strong!!"

emetophobia,fnnb4b8,t3_g2q9qh,1587088380.0,yes!!! me right now. usually every day. tonight i could only stomach soup and bread.
BipolarReddit,fnjo764,t1_fnjj5qz,1587003172.0,this made me tear up. so happy you have found all of this love in this life. <3 hopefully my future is similar.
emetophobia,fnimlij,t3_g1z67s,1586982614.0,hey! we’re all in this together. i’m really sorry you don’t have good support from your mom. we are all here for you and you can private message me anytime. please don’t hurt yourself. you WILL get through this. i promise <3 just last night i was up with a stomach ache freaking out and i’m here right now. no matter what you’ll be okay. please reach out to me if you need help or someone to talk to who completely understands what you’re going thru.
emetophobia,fncgf5s,t3_g0xegb,1586836129.0,yes i think this is what i’m going thru rn too. lmk if u wanna talk!
emetophobia,fnc798f,t3_g0vo7v,1586830126.0,"i would definitely eat something small at first! i would also not have hot tea on an empty stomach, that’s just me. maybe a piece of bread, crackers, soup, anything bland u can get your hands on should do the trick. make sure to stay hydrated! start small and go from there. you’ll be okay !! :) <3"
emetophobia,fnbo87o,t3_g0tqzb,1586819090.0,"in never have before! i know people with really bad cramps who haven’t either. it is normal to have diarrhea because of your period but i think less common to actually v*. keep the heating pack and try a cold compress (wet,cold,handtowel) on the back of your neck. take it easy :) i don’t think you’ll v*!"
emetophobia,fnbo14b,t3_g0sx0p,1586818982.0,"all sounds pretty normal to me :) i have a high metabolism too and my poop schedules can vary day to day. some days i poop a lot, some days i don’t. try to not let your anxiety cause the nausea and just breathe thru everything. water is good and so is eating stuff like bread! maybe tums or pepto to ease the upset a little bit? feel free to DM me! hope you’re already feeling better."
period,fnbnao4,t3_g0rzz7,1586818589.0,"honestly, i’m pretty open about my close friends/partner seeing me nude or helping me out when times get tough, like this. if i were you i would have a helper help me out! if that doesn’t work - go to the doc asap :)"
emetophobia,fn7c2fa,t3_fzmtcc,1586717376.0,"i smoked every day for a couple years. i have definitely heard of people smoking way too much and getting sick. “greening out.” when i would have a bad high, that was always my fear. i would get really nauseas and hyperventilate, i was having really bad panic attacks. i quit a few months ago - the anxiety was too much. but if you use responsibly and in *very very* small amounts - you should be fine!!! i say very small like 1 tiny hit. wait a little. is that enough? stop. not enough? take another tiny one. and wait it out. i’ve also never taken an edible. just from my emetophobic standpoint - you don’t get to take it slow which means it’s harder to prevent a bad experience. i stay away from edibles :) also a nice tip that i live by is to never ever smoke after you’re already drunk. being crossfaded and smoking while you drink is a fun time, but drinking and then finishing up the night with a smoke is never the best idea in my experience. causes the spins and nausea and ultra confusion - just not worth it."
emetophobia,fn1kwbe,t3_fylnsb,1586564192.0,I absolutely understand this feeling. I have been feeling nauseas or generally anxious and bad at and after dinner. Just trying to cope and get through it. We will. Good luck to you <3

emetophobia,fmqt5j3,t3_fwset7,1586306501.0,drink some water and maybe take some tums or belly medicine to calm down the acid reflux/IBS. im sure you’ll be okay <3
BipolarReddit,fmqkvv9,t1_fmo9ylu,1586301618.0,yes that’s a really good point! i always have trouble noticing if i feel different until i feel way worse. i am with my partner so that support is great. thank u!

BipolarReddit,fj8qzme,t3_fby83s,1583119979.0,"i quit smoking too. the bad highs got to me and made my life hell. i would be with people i’m close with and trust, and their faces changed. their faces changed to completely different people i didn’t recognize. i don’t know if i’ll ever smoke again. the fun highs are long gone. sending support and love."
