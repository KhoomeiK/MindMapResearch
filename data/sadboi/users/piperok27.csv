Just keep a towel on hand and mop the floor after he goes to bed. Always keep saying ""pee goes in the potty!"", never say it's okay when they pee on the floor.

Day 2-3 something clicked, might not be as fast for others but they get tired of peeing on themselves. Make a huge deal out of it when they get the pee in the potty and use bribe if you have to.

Day 4 - we tried pants with no undies underneath, she did great, no regression.

Day 10- we tried panties, she did great, no regression and stopped having accidents.

We're three weeks in and haven't had an accident since like the second week of potty training.

Every kid is going to be different but with my girl, taking her to the potty every hour just pissed her off. She started self-initiating on her own and letting me know when she had to potty which worked out best for both of us. Obviously at the beginning you will have to prompt but be careful about over prompting which is where the resistance kicks in.

She never had a poop accident but was terrified to poop on the potty because sitting down to poop was so new and she was used to standing up to poop. Just know this part will take awhile."
