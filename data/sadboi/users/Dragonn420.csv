Dude. Regardless of whether she lied or not, you clearly have some deep seated issues with trust.
Let me put this into perspective, she had a private recording that you listened to. After listening to it, you then went through her MEDICAL RECORDS, emails, and probably her phone too. 
Then you posted on reddit about it, and now
 you want to post the recording? 
It's a breach of privacy and a lack of empathy. What if that really is her talking about being actually raped? Do you want to advertise that to the world? So she pours her heart out into a private recording, and then, not only do you listen to it, but you post it on the internet to be memorialized forever?

You have just discovered your wife does not work well under pressure and long stressful hours.

You should talk to her, let her know that even though you *do* understand she's been doing a lot of work and is exhausted and crabby, it hurts you to be treated that way, and what she said was hurtful and uncalled for. 
Calmly explain that you have been re organizing and cleaning while taking care of two toddlers. Out of all the cooking you've done and everything, you have only burnt food once, and it was due to a misunderstanding, not a fault. 
Explain that if she were in your position, she would want her efforts recognized and appreciated, not torn down. You are no more a paycheck then she is. 

She said something shitty, but y'all have been together way too long and loving each other way too long to let that cause a broken family or anything of the sort.
Should she have controlled her tongue? Yes! That was an asshole thing to say. But you have to understand the situation she's in. She's likely also feeling under appreciated, tired, and probably like a paycheck. So it most likely brought those feelings up.

unpopularopinion,fffi4ej,t1_fffgrsr,1579884460.0,"I think this conversation is fruitless. You clearly have a set belief that anyone with dread locks is gross, and I have a set belief that as long as its not a public health hazard, people can have their hair however they want. And neither of our opinions are going to change, so have a good day."
unpopularopinion,fffg2vs,t1_fffdp7j,1579883191.0,"Actually no. Most dread locks are created using a back brushing technique. You separate the piece of hair you want to turn into a dreadlock, and then you back comb it until it is tangled into a dread, then it is rolled in your palm to smooth the outside. You can soak and wash them, and keep them clean. You just can't brush it. And as time goes on, because the hair is tangled, when your hair falls out and a new strand comes in to replace it, the strand that fell out will be trapped in your hair, adding volume. But you still wash it along with the rest of your hair. So, hypothetically it isn't any worse then owning a wig, which is dead hair that you keep, wear and wash on occasion. 

Although, a lot of people will add oil to their dreads, oil is very good for your hair, and plenty of people without dreads use it, as well as some sort of oil is usually in hair products. And it gets washed out. 
So yeah. If you're just laying around letting your hair collect grossness, that's a problem."
unpopularopinion,ffffgeu,t1_fffaft1,1579882805.0,"Dread locks are perfectly capable of looking clean and well groomed if properly cared for. 
Celeb examples: Kelela, Chloe x Halle, Richard sherman, Wale, Lalah Hathaway, etc. 
Those are well groomed and neat dread locks, and the people themselves look quite professional generally. 

I'm not saying we let kids do whatever they want, but so long as it is clean and well cared for, it shouldn't matter. Kids are allowed to show up with dirty clothes and bodies, but certain hair isn't allowed even when properly done? Also interesting that braids/twists aren't allowed, those aren't dirty at all, they just have a *resemblance* to dreads."

It does not matter how much trauma you have endured, it does NOT give you the right to hurt or traumatize someone else. Period.

I am a daily smoker for medical reasons, but when I first moved in with my spouse (who is a social smoker) he would let literally anyone hang out if they smoked weed because he thought they were chill. I really had to put my foot down on that one and nail it in that just because people smoke doesn't mean they are chill or good people. Especially the younger generation. A lot of these kids are getting into it because they think its cool. Posting videos on Instagram smoking a blunt with shitty trap playing in the background  its just like the whole cigarettes and leather jackets thing from the 80s. Its a fad.

That is why it is an *opinion*. The definition of opinion is ""a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.""

Therefore, it is personal, and should NOT be enforced on the public. That's the issue we are having. People need to learn to keep their opinions to themselves, and not force it on others. Is that so hard?"

And there is a reason for that, people in power are more likely to  be sociopathic or narcissistic, so they like making people follow what *they* want, and it makes them feel superior.  And reddit brings out the assholes of course because it's anonymous.

People go there to achieve their dreams, and often end up slaving their lives away for someone else just to stay afloat. Stress levels are always high and the people are higher. 
On any given night the drunkards are stumbling around at 1am, while prostitutes strut along the sidewalk. Everything is about money, if you don't have it, you wont be able to survive. It's home to millions of diseases and viruses that spread like wild fire given the close proximity of people. The average ally smells like piss and garbage. 


But seriously, I live in the middle of nowhere next to a river in the mountains. I would consider it nearly impossible to starve here, too many animals and too many edible plants. Everybody knows everyone and so there is a sense of security in that. 
Its quiet, and I get to watch deer, moose and elk gracefully strut around on any given morning in thick mist. If I need fresh air, I can go wherever I want to. 
It's beautiful and I don't think I would ever trade it for a city, and I've lived in both.

I just figured if I was him, I'd break it off if she was that selfish. 
BUT, I didn't hear the part about the kid, knowing that pisses me off and I *totally* understand why he freaked out about it. She deserved that, its her responsibility as a mother to prioritize her child. I was under the impression that this was some bf/gf bullshit and she was supporting them both while he doesn't seem to be doing much. 
As a woman, I do not expect my bf to pay for all my food and such, and we live together, so we pool our funds. I guess I find it somewhat offensive when people automatically *expect* to be taken car of like kids by their bf/gf when they are fully capable adults.
Throw a kid in the mix and I have a very different point of view."

I imagine this conversation would have been far more civilized had he not decided to do that, over all she seemed to try to keep the drama at bay. Not that I agree with her financial choices, but he sure wasn't in the spot to do what he did.

relationship_advice,ff933sr,t3_esbnfo,1579703665.0,"If you were a girl, people would be losing their shit over that age gap. Personally, I'm not too fond of your situation either. Age gaps are *often* quite controlling and toxic. (Have been in one, can confirm) 
You are 20, and she's 40. When you're 50, she'll be 70. And she'll likely die well before your life is over.
So the question you have to ask yourself is if you love this person enough to spend your prime years with her? And will you be ready when *you* are ready to ""kick your feet up"", and you'll be alone or have to find a new woman? (Unless she happens to live until 90+)
If you are having desires and wants outside of that relationship and you have been together a year, what will it look like in 10 years? How much worse do you think those desires will get? Will you resent her for ""taking""  your prime away?
You sound like a young man who just isn't ready to settle down yet, and you are with a woman who had the same urges you did at your age, and she's lived it all out and she wants to settle down. 
20 year olds have a hard time settling down the way she wants to, and if she doesn't know that already, I question her intelligence. You have a lot of questions to ask yourself, and then you need to weigh your options and decide what to do. 
I hope it all works out for you."
unpopularopinion,ff7awcr,t3_es1f38,1579644998.0,"Actually, there is scientific proof of it working. 
But it takes effort because to have to train your brain to do it. Someone was doing a bunch of research on how meditation works, and they took a brain scan of a monk as he began to meditate, his amygdala lit up like a Christmas tree, beyond what they'd ever seen. Your amygdala is the part of your brain that regulates compassion, empathy, love, etc. 
Similarly, looking at the brain scan of a psychopath shows little to no activity in the amygdala area of the brain. 
So yes, it works, but you have to activate the part of your brain that releases the love chemicals."

I also think it is over rated, but for different reasons. 
Modelling takes more then looking good, models have rigorous training routines to keep them looking the way they do. It's just that their work outs don't focus on creating a healthy body, they work on creating a *pretty* body. 
Most models are trained to walk in super difficult shoes. (Google models falling in heels, I'd never touch 85% of them if i was planning on walking down a slick runway.)
You also have no control over what does or doesn't go on your body, that is entirely up to the designer/employer, so you will be dressed down to nothing at times, and others so over dressed you look like a stuffed seal, it doesn't matter, you have to eat it and wear or not wear it anyway.
Their diets are insane, and often lacking in enough calories to sustain them properly, a lot of high end models turn to drugs and others of all types go to weight loss pills to help with that weight loss. I remember seeing an interview with an older model discussing it, and she said she wouldn't do it again if she had the choice.
You are expected to work on the schedules of others, not your own. As it is your job is ""only"" to look the best you possibly can in order to advertise someone elses clothing. 
If you are famous, you are also open to super harsh criticism from the public, often of their bodies unfortunately. 
And with that, often you are *expected* to get little cosmetic surgery's along the way, because god forbid you might *age*.
I remember seeing another model say that her agency had set her up to date a footballer for publicity, she was married and thought that excluded her from the dating/relationship thing. Apparently not. A lot of them seem shallow because they are, they spend their whole lives obsessing about how they look and who they are with and what it will do to their reputation, because they have contracts to fill and agents to please. That is their whole livelihood, looking good *to the public*. 

My point is, their lives are actually not something to aspire to, many of them aren't happy, and aren't healthy. You're seeing their perfectly angled and edited 00.02 seconds of their lives, because their job is to sell you something."
