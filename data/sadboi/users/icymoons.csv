Never tried this. What's it like?

I had to dig around on this one. If I'm right, this targets glutamate right? The effects it has on glutamate could be accomplished by something other than an antibiotic couldn't it? I saw somethings about picking it apart and making something for depression and other problems but, I don't think using an antibiotic long-term is good for anyone unless your treating something and the risk/benefit is worth it.
