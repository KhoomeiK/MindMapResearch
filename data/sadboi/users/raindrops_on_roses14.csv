Vindicta,flrhdet,t3_fnsqut,1585420231.0,"Good luck!! Even though quarantine stinks, I’m trying to make the best of it. Here’s my list...

1. Gain some weight. I’m 5’9” and weigh 115, which isn’t at all healthy. No, I’m not anorexic or anything; I actually eat more than average and should be gaining weight. Doctors don’t even know why I’m this thin, which scares be a bit lol. I’m going to start doing more intense exercises to hopefully gain some muscle. 

2. Use self-tanning lotion or find better makeup. I’m pretty pale, so lots of makeup companies don’t carry foundation light enough for me. I’m either going to invest in new makeup once stores such as Sephora reopen or possibly use some self-tanner to look a tad bit darker. 

3. Start doing hair masks. I have wavy-curly hair that requires a ton of product to look decent, so I’d like to find treatments that condition my hair and enhance my curls. 

4. Whiten my teeth. That ones pretty self-explanatory haha. 

5. Fix my dark circles and redness. My skin isn’t the worst, but I’d love to get rid of my stubborn dark circles and redness. If anyone has suggestions for what products to use, please let me know!!

6. I’m about three months from being done with Invisalign, so my smile will hopefully look great after quarantine ends!!

7. Learn to properly diffuse my hair. Diffusing always makes me hair look weird, but I’d love to be able to diffuse in order to dry my hair faster. 

If anyone has any suggestions for achieving my goals, please let me know!! I’d love as much advice as I can possibly get :)"

I've tried to accept the fact that people aren't willing to pour that much time and effort into getting me back to a better place. My friends will just watch as I slip farther and farther into my pit of self-loathing. But I can't help but have the tiniest bit of hope that someone wants to save me.

Note: I am a super pale white girl who lives in a predominantly white area and have little experience in dealing with issues of race or color. Therefore, if I do happen to overstep or say something offensive, please correct me. I don’t believe I’m being racist or insensitive, but if you believe I am, please don’t hesitate to call me out for it. I want to respect all races and skin colors, but I don’t fully understand how to do that due to my experiences :)

I don’t believe you’re disrespecting your culture. If you want to be whiter, I think that’s perfectly fine. Just know in your heart that your skin color doesn’t define you and that you are beautiful no matter what shade you are. I don’t see this as much different than a pale white girl like me using self-tanner or laying out in the sun to become darker. If you’re more confident when your skin is lighter, then that’s okay! On the flip side, I always feel a little more confident in the summer when I am not a complete ghost and have a little more color. 

However, make sure the products you are using are safe for your skin in the long run!! I don’t want you to be damaging your skin to be a little whiter now and end up with problems in a few years :)"
