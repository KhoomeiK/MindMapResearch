I naturally like to push myself so my very first ride was circa 20kms but start slowly then build up from that. The longest ride I've done was just a little under 100kms but it was gruelling. 

My advice for you is to start small and build up on that. Most importantly, don't be afraid but instead be very alert and cautious. Also, listen to your body all the time and watch your diet."

""Just happened a few hours ago hence the thread. I'm currently working night shift in an Arab school, and as you know, you can't have contact with the ladies, not even looking at them unless they talk to you first. 
 
Schools are closed but the teachers come sometimes to pick things from the office. They normally notify us an hour or so before they come so that you can open the offices and leave the premises, then lock them up after they are gone. Mind you, I'm all alone during the night shift but the other day security personnel are also around but off duty. We were provided with temporary accommodation within the school due to COVID-19.

So, I'm doing my regular patrols which normally has me exiting from the reception door and as I approach the reception area, I clearly hear what sounds like ladies talking. I come face to face with one of the ladies and she immediately covers her face while complaining in Arabic why the offices were closed (I was not informed that anyone was supposed to come tonight) and coincidentally enough, they came when I was doing my patrol and quite far from the gate so I couldn't hear anything.

I opened the offices and responded to their requests and they left like an hour ago. The problem is their thinking is absolutely black or white thinking, no In-between. They want this, you have seconds to deliver it. They call you, they expect you to pick up the phone in seconds..so anything could happen. 

So well, let's see if anything happens tomorrow"""
