Women ignore me and guys turn their back on me, but do you know what, I don't care anymore. The people who matter the most to me care about me, and as much as I wish I didn't exist there are people who I would hurt if I ceased to be. The one truth that you can take from life is that no-one is going to help you or even care for you, not until you ask them for help. So I'm going to heed my own advice and ask someone for help. I really hope you do the same.

Kind regards
