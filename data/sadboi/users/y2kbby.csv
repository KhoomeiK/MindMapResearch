Degrassi,fp2tm33,t1_fp2qxvw,1588267675.0,"so why did he act like he still expected to graduate even after his cancer? he still studied hard asf for exams it was a whole storyline. and i cant remember them ever specifying it was because of his cancer treatment. and if it is bc of the cancer treatment, i still think that him not graduating was a bad choice on the writers. like it was really upsetting he didnt graduate with all of his friends spin is one of my favs"

Degrassi,foi33q9,t1_foi302n,1587777732.0,omg yes exactly!! she was so gorgeous with her long hair i think it was her best look
Degrassi,fo6336c,t3_fofhiw,1587544678.0,they always gave manny the ugliest hairstyles for no reason. ever since season 5 when they gave her that scene girl layered hair its all been pretty bad. and its a shame because shes so pretty and the hair kinda ruins it.
Degrassi,fo60j8a,t3_g5ow7x,1587541988.0,"when i watched it growing up i was IN LOVE with craig seriously, and rewatching it now i was really excited for season 2 when he gets introduced, he is so charming in the beginning. but later on he is such a douchebag i cant believe i overlooked it. now that im older i can see how he treated manny, ashley, and ellie like shit, and was never apologetic for any of it. he was so manipulative especially when it came to the horrible way he treated girls. having bipolar disorder is not an excuse for not having a concience.

that being said, i realized how SPINNER is actually the cutest and best guy on the show!! he showed so much growth throughout the show, and treated the girls he liked with kindess and respect. even early on in the first 2 seasons when he was the school bully, he was so sweet to terri like the scene when he calls her pretty and encourages her to keep modeling. not to mention his style and his piercings and his sexy badass attitude haha

also peter is a disgusting creep. im still only on season 5 rewatching but from everything i remember hes horrible and never faces any repurcussions. and ms. hatzalacos or however you spell it totally gives him passes because shes his mom."

selfharm,fmr7aw4,t3_fwncy0,1586315567.0,"I understand why youre upset, self harm is no thing to boast about or be insensitive about. But I have personally battled self harm along with depression and a lot of other shit from a really young age and I personally have learned to use my sense of humor as a coping mechanism. I also make self harm jokes about myself to my friends sometimes. Im adopted and joke about that too at times. Not to mean that these serious things are a ""laughing matter"", but we're just trying to make ourselves feel better and find something to laugh at in a really hard situation to help us get through it although its infortunate. Id rather laugh about something than cry about it. You'd be suprised at how many people use humour as a coping mechanism.  Maybe you should just avoid going through the comment sections of videos like that if its going to piss you off so much?"
