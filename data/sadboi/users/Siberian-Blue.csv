TwoXChromosomes,fqbsmwv,t3_gdqjsw,1589243131.0,"My story is similar to yours, my father is a drug addict with a complicated personality...

I think the worst thing he's done to me was when I was about 12 years old. I was crying a lot because I had been told I was ugly at school. My mum tried to convince me that I was pretty but I was being very reluctant and when she finally gave up, my father told me I was lucky to be ugly because ""only pretty girls get raped"".

I think this impacted me a lot more than it should have, as I was then starting to having fantasies and exploring my body, I developed rather strong rape fantaisies... I don't know what the hell was wrong with me but I believed him, and I wanted to be pretty and that sadly shaped me into the girl that I am today."
TwoXChromosomes,fqboxdt,t3_ggxh4d,1589241104.0,"Hi there!

So from what I read, it seems like there has been a lot going on in your head about how you viewed your genitals. I am glad that you no longer feel repulsed by it, as I don't think it's normal to consider your own body disgusting. But why did you ever feel this way in the first place? Have you been taught as a child that sex was gross? Can you think of any event that could have leaded you to think your vagina was disgusting? If so, that could explain the complicated relationship that you have with it and potential traumas that would just bring anxiety.

The other thing that I want to point out is how you mentioned your partner who tried to get you to touch yourself. I'm not sure what you meant by partner, but in any case, could she have been either forcing herself on you, or forcing you to do things with your body thay you did not want to do? Because that would explain why you would feel bad.

In any case, take it slow and don't stress it. Masturbation is healthy, natural, and can be awesome but if for you it's a stressful process then there's literally no point and you're not obligated to do so! I do hope you'll find a better harmony with your body, good luck with everything!"
TwoXChromosomes,fqbm7cp,t3_ghpszv,1589239611.0,"Hello there, the only times when I felt pain around my clit was when masturbating too much.

That being said, I don't think that what she said was awful, she said that you were on the smaller side and that it limits positions, she's hasn't been very specific or gave details AND what she said doesn't have to be taken as being something negative. She didn't said oh he's so small I don't enjoy myself. Just that some positions weren't achievable. But if you think about it, no one can achieve every sex position for various reasons, such as flexibility, physical aptitudes, etc... I understand one could be hurt from reading such a comment but I also think we have to get over that glorification of huge penis, big or small, all penises are awesome!"
