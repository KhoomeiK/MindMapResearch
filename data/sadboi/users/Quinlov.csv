AskReddit,fr26idj,t1_fr0ooy9,1589831985.0,"This bothers me surprisingly much considering I have actually been sexually assault and unfazed by it, but basically some young women see gay men as OK to touch all over because ""it's not sexual"" and I'm just like totally not OK with physical contact with women because it's very unfamiliar to me and not wanted. I mean a hug is fine if it's someone I know but in a flirtatious way? Please no. In contrast if it's a man even if it's someone I'm not attracted to I'm generally not that bothered. If it's excessive I might ask him to stop but it doesn't make me feel violated in the same way as when women do it. 
 
There are two more things that probably contribute to this: 1. When I was growing up a lot of girls considered me to be really creepy (even though from very young I was only perving on men) so I do have a bit of a complex about coming off as creepy towards women. I guess if they touch me it turns all that upside down. And 2. Sometimes I kind of forget that women have sex? Like legit when my girl friends talk about having sex with their boyfriends I'm often a bit surprised for a minute that they actually do have sexuality. It sounds dumb but I'm a man and only interested in men so for me sex is just something that's only between men."
AskReddit,fr25mbo,t3_glz1vu,1589831556.0,"I didn't report it because basically I was surprisingly unaffected by it. Not a surprise to me, but for people who don't know me, obviously people don't expect someone to not really give a shit about having been sexually assaulted. I have a feeling some of my friends wouldn't be surprised if I told them, though. 
 
Basically my flatmate had shagged this guy and left him in his room as he (my flatmate) had to go to work, and he left me to look after him because he seemed a bit unwell when he left and also to make sure he didn't steal anything. Well, I introduced myself and he seemed perfectly fine. He asked if I wanted to fuck, I was just like yeah sure, guy was alright looking. Well, he had a super long dick, unfortunately I'm better at taking really thick ones than long ones. He was also quite aggressive which normally I would like (I mean like fucking really hard, not violent) but thanks to his ridiculously long dick it was kind of hurting, so I was asking him to slow down a bit a couple of times. As he didn't do it I tried to push him off at which point he kind of pinned me down and said that he wouldn't stop until he came. So I tried to make him cum as fast as possible which was kind of difficult because my arse isn't that tight (hence why I am good at thick dicks) but yeah eventually he did. 
  
  
Shortly after that he left. I was a bit just like, well that was fucking unpleasant but to be honest was kind of able to shrug it off. I did end up bleeding though (not from the anus, from deeper), not heavily but not lightly either, so I know I wasn't being over the top about it hurting. Honestly I had always thought my reaction in this kind of situation would be mild after having heard how badly a lot of people take these kind of things, I had a kind of survivors guilt I suppose, because of thinking it would be better if it happened to me rather than them. And to be honest I was right, if I remember that morning (for example if I see someone who looks like him) I'm not like distressed by it, I just kind of consider it a bad lay. I guess after having slept around a lot and had some guys that were really bad (but through no fault of their own, just clueless about how to use a dick etc) it wasn't that much worse than some of the others I'd fucked. Also the beginning was alright, it was just when he started like stabbing my insides that it was uncomfortable. And I'd seen him around before and wanted to shag him, just ended up happening earlier than expected. And he was surprisingly bad in bed for someone who I assume sleeps around quite a lot (I mean, my flatmate and I both do and he seemed chill with the situation of a random guy appearing ready to be fucked lol) and I can't imagine he could be that inconsiderate to *everyone* because on other occasions he must be interested in maintaining someone as a fuck buddy, and with the length of his dick I imagine that a lot of people struggle, no-one has an 11 inch rectum. 
 
I kind of wonder how many guys have a similar situation to me where they were mostly unaffected by it. I'm not ashamed of it or anything but I wouldn't mention it to anyone I know so as not to cause them distress or make them worry about me, because that would be totally unjustified. So it makes me feel like there could be some other guys in a similar position who don't mention it because there's no need to talk about it. I obviously imagine it's a small proportion but I also doubt I'm the only one"

AskReddit,fqwlo2c,t1_fqwk820,1589709048.0,"That's why I said depending on the election. UKIP is essentially the new BNP. I'm aware it wasn't always. 
 
And Barking is actually where I was referring to specifically."

ShitAmericansSay,fqwl494,t3_glc5lf,1589708449.0,"As far as I understood it the entire western theatre was a distraction more than anything and while it was the USA that helped make it a viable distraction in terms of manpower on land, the Russians did the real work"
eu4,fqwk699,t3_glbiv4,1589707426.0,Inside sources say its actually Cuba
AskReddit,fqwjevk,t1_fqwjan6,1589706628.0,"I heard a lot of that in high school but since then I haven't, but I guess when I went to uni people were more tolerant in general there..."
AskReddit,fqwjcuo,t1_fqwizv0,1589706567.0,"I'm referring to a specific type of English person that probably hasn't read enough about anything to have any sort of ideology but hates anyone who is not white, female, lgbt, young, poor, foreign, and seems to want to declare war on Europe (and the rest of the world) - basically people that would've voted UKIP, BNP, or FN depending on the year. I have a friend who lived in a part of London with a lot of these"
askgaybros,fqwifmq,t1_fqwi9gs,1589705582.0,"Yeah I'm sure I've had more Muslims tell me calmly that they think I should stop being gay for whatever reason, coming from a mixture of intolerance and ignorance, but I prefer that to getting beaten to the point of internal bleeding and having my windows smashed and fireworks through the letterbox 
 
For the dense, these are not random examples plucked out of nowhere."
AskReddit,fqwhtnu,t1_fqwgwvx,1589704937.0,I think it depends largely on the part of London. Most of London is at least better than the rest of England for these things but there are pockets of fascists.
AskReddit,fqwhnbt,t1_fqw8tip,1589704756.0,In the UK people will put on a census form Black British. In most conversational contexts either race or nationality is relevant though rather than both
AskReddit,fqwhcbl,t1_fqwgwhr,1589704436.0,I think the German approach makes much more sense. There's perfectly solid grounds to avoid having a national dataset of who is what race. But just forbidding collecting stats on something which does make differences to people's lives is silly
ibs,fqwgfav,t3_gla1w9,1589703500.0,"I have had this type of constipation before. I'm now experiencing the diarrhoea version - the same but 7 times a day. Would be interested if someone else has something actually useful to say. 
 
The only thing I think helped at all with the diarrhoea version was calcium and vitamin d supplements. Calcium can cause constipation so maybe if you take it with some magnesium it would help? But I'm not sure because I very rarely have to deal with constipation"
aww,fqwfwnq,t1_fqw9m7i,1589702976.0,In Spain we take the rubbish out every day so yes!
