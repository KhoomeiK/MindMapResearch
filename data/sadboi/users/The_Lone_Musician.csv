I don't like being single because I've already been alone most my life, I simply want companionship and the validation of knowing I'm lovable and desirable. I don't like my appearance because of my abhorrent weight and my abnormally large teeth and the large, dark circles that are always under my eyes. I get mad at myself because I want to be something big in my lifetime but I can't muster the motivation to do anything to work toward that goal. The list simply goes on and on.
