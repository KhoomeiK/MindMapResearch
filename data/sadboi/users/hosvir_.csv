&#x200B;

The main problem is that the cream is an emulsion between water and the fat in the cheese. Now, as anyone knows water and fat don't like to mix, so we're using the starch  in the pasta water as an emulsifier. This means cooking the pasta in the lowest volume of water possible to maximize starch concentration, and with less salt than you would normally to compensate for the saltiness of the cheese.

&#x200B;

Then it's time to pre-melt the cheese in the bowl. You gotta time it cause if you do it too soon your water will not be as starchy as possible, if you do it too late you will overcook the pasta. 60-45 seconds before draining the pasta is the sweet spot.   
If you try and pre-melt the cheese with boiling  water, it will very likely separate into its liquid and fatty phases, and your pasta is ruined. I found that one small ice cube to one ladleful of pasta water cools it down to the perfect temperature to effectively melt the cheese risk-free. The ratio of water to cheese requires practice as well - I leave it slightly  liquidy and pull my pasta a little early -  it's gonna absorb the excess liquid while mantecating like a risotto, and I get perfect sauce distribution this way, but I guess this step is personal preference.

 Lastly, the mantecation process may require a little bit of practice to get perfect as the size and material of the bowl you're doing it in and the amount of pasta you're working with are relevant.

&#x200B;

Igredients-wise, the pecorino romano has to not be too old/cured - salty and funky but with a sweetness to it, and crumbly. The stuff that is all salt is no good, and doesn't melt very well. Any bronze drawn-pasta is okay. If you can toast your peppercorns whole and then grind them, it makes a difference,

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk about pasta."
