depression,f5sqql8,t3_dp12kn,1572440586.0,"In the age of food delivery apps, I haven't really had to step foot out of the house to feed myself, if I feel like eating. I only get out to go to work and back and nothing else. There's just no energy for anything else, really. I wish to get out of the rut but at the moment, the rut is more comfortable than outside."
depression,f2dhyxn,t3_dd0w3v,1570154704.0,"I hear you. I feel that way too, even all that I've done or put into... I wish there was a way to get out of it.."
depression,exelkd4,t3_cs2ogj,1566219215.0,"I hear you. The only reason I stopped short of ending it all is because of my Mom. I couldn't do it to her, at least, not again. We already had a suicide in our family and that changed the dynamics of my immediate and not so immediate family members so, as much as I want to end it all for myself, I could not bear to see my Mom suffer again. But I worry, though. She's not young anymore. And when she goes, I don't think there's anything holding me back anymore. But, yeah, hang in there, at least for them. I know what it's like going through someone else's suicide..."
depression,ewnperq,t3_cp1ajy,1565585511.0,"The story of my life right there. I'd be in some good company but I'm always feeling left out. I've tried to ""belong"" but it never seems to happen. I think I've done all I introvertedly can but I don't have any idea how to anymore."
depression,ewaio3u,t3_cn5vlj,1565244498.0,"Waking up? What is that? I find myself in a never ending cycle of lacking sleep. I don't think I have ever been in it or out of it. Everything is just a haze. If there is a ""waking up"", I missed the memo..."
depression,ew641h3,t3_cmxonf,1565153289.0,"For a few years now. Somehow, the tear ducts run dry, even though the feels don't stop.. Not sure why, still wondering..."
depression,ew1vjxi,t3_cm28m0,1565032409.0,"I can totally relate. The people I wish would talk to me never do, and I'm holed up in my house almost every day that I can't bring myself to be ""a friend"" anymore. I feel like I'm the one who needs to start or get the conversation going instead of them making the effort and whenever they have anything fun, I'm never one they'd invite. I don't think I'm remotely socially stunted and I can definitely carry myself well when needed but I don't think I can handle the one-way-ness of this ""friendship"". Guess I'm stuck being alone with my black dog called depression."
depression,etqmg9z,t3_cct3jo,1563091839.0,"Happy Birthday! I did that last year, drove to another state (almost) just to get out of the house. I go to the movies alone most times too. Sometimes, all we need is just a little sunshine. Or shopping."
friendship,esyshps,t1_esynyb1,1562348648.0,"I get what you mean, but in a way, that so-called ""best friend"" didn't have to go through what I went through. Didn't get the ""oh, you weren't invited for dinner because your 'bestie' was there"" end of the stick. That's what sucks. I end up with the short end of the stick due to someone else's illogical decision but they are not paying for it, that's how it feels. That's why it's still hard to continue friendships if decisions like that keep happening to me."
friendship,esyn97p,t1_esyn12y,1562345984.0,"In a way, I wonder, if they like me, then why didn't they stand up for me? And by standing up, I mean, choose my side? That's what bugs me to this day."
friendship,esvuedn,t1_esu9dn9,1562304281.0,"Yup, dropped like nothing but suffering all the collateral damages from that event that I had no part in. I'm still feeling the effects of it for sure. I want to move on but I just don't know how to."
friendship,esvu6e6,t1_esttcyh,1562304181.0,"I have actually done the opposite at the moment. I have withdrawn from friends because, well, mutual friends are painful reminders and also, some of them have still continued their friendship with the so-called ""best friend"" even though they know of the situation and do not approve of it so it feels like a stab in the back."
depression,ese9dmp,t3_c7b20k,1561888428.0,"I feel you. I am that way too. I care for people but I don't feel like I am getting the same in return, and this is me not expecting it. I think part of it is I might feel like a lousy friend if I didn't care. But at the same time, I need to start taking care of myself before I take care of others and that is not being selfish, it's loving myself so that I can then care for others. I'm learning to not give a fuck if people don't care for me; I can tell you there are days that it works and then there are days that it doesn't. But, all in all, you should take care of you first before others."
depression,ese8zeu,t3_c7batd,1561887825.0,Happy Birthday! I remembered wanting to kill myself on my birthday last year. It was hell last year for me too and I'm sorry it's hard for you. I can't tell you that it gets better but just know that you are not alone in this.
depression,erpobke,t3_c3agw7,1561123855.0,"I listen to Sara Bareilles or Kelly Clarkson, especially the dark and emotional ones, even though I really shouldn't."

depression,er4szuk,t1_er2imty,1560508698.0,"I just make very little eye contact with workers there. Other than not being able to share the experience with someone, it's the random stranger that sits next to you that might annoy you with their own interjections and conversations that annoy me when I have to watch movies alone..."
depression,eqzlpws,t1_eqzl9a4,1560402281.0,"I was there for a long time; being afraid of going to the movies alone, being afraid of people's perception. I still am, sometimes, but having travelled out of country alone has sorta helped overcome the fear a bit. If I could go to the movies with you, I would too. I'm rooting for you."
depression,eqzkh9i,t3_bzzzf0,1560401621.0,I feel you. I'm at this point where I'm watching movies at the cinemas on my own too because there is just no one. I just wish it would get better...
