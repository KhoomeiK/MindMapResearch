AskLiteraryStudies,fp0z4a8,t3_gao06e,1588220258.0,"I see a thing here so I’m gonna talk about it. I warn you, its past midnight 


canon is Language and geography based. You talk about a whole big literary canon. At this point that’s classics, The Bible, or whatever your perspective tells you what it is. Sure it might involve some non english pieces, like Les Mis or Don’t Quijote, but that’s because of the perspective. An English speaker is far more likely to know another white language and culturally speaking, english is dominant in the media. So that’s where you’re going to see the “canon” skew. Where are the other dominant medias lately? Where were they in history? mostly white people. So you’re going to see white stories. 

So in VERY BASIC terms, the non white canon is going to be the Non English canon until the English people get themselves together and take the time to translate what they’ve looked down upon for years.

To actually answer your question: I think a good place to start is to look for translated work from other places. Places that aren’t white. 

But also, Jumping off of Toni Morrison is an excellent spot. I think the Tuscarora have a somewhat active language hotspot, but native stories are far more oral tradition and there’s a LOT OF messy things in that bucket of Why We Don’t. 

Also THIS IS ALL ARBITRARY AND MADE UP. In reality THE CANON does NOT EXIST other than us listening to what the people before us thought was the pinnacle of literary whoseawhatsit. So go outside “your canon”.  By going outside your borders. Find the works you can access. Magical Realism is a HUGE THING. Go look at that! 

Jesus. I hope I made my Spanish professors proud with this. I rewrote this three times not to ramble.

yoga,foovco8,t3_g89fsb,1587947246.0,"This is actually something that has prevented me from creating a fully formed practice-yay trauma.

 Yoga in general, opens me up in the mind/body/spirit way. Yin yoga does it a lot more, but also less. I have a lot of anxiety around physical activity so when I'm doing a Youtube practice with a talking teacher versus something like Down Dog with a more passive teacher- I end up breaking a lot. Sometimes I just need to focus on what my body is going to bring to me versus what someone else is (even in the best of senses) is going to bring to me. 

 Yin yoga in and of itself is a catch 22: it opens and lets me process in those moments, but at the same time yin yoga is so low key that I'm not worried about ""doing it right"" like I am when I'm doing a more intense form. 

I don't know if that breakdown will help but I'm working on it with my counselor soon. You might be able to work through it with your practice, in a meditative way. Meditation talked me through acknowledging the thought without taking it on. So acknowledge the thing, and then let it pass and focus on your mind/body in the yoga moment. It won't work and it takes practice, but it might be worth a thought process.

So I was a violin player for years. I really loved it but the school I chose didn't have a music program that I could pop into. Unless I wanted to play for the church (a catholic university) which I wasn't too hip on playing for an institution I didn't believe in. The University is a specific brotherhood that I really truly identify with and adore, but the Church as a whole...woof. So I haven't been musical in years. 

Then I started dating my boyfriend who can pick up most any stringed instrument and have it figured out in a few hours to a few days. I borrowed his ukelele and realized...oh hey yeah I get this still. One day  I was browsing facebook marketplace and found a guitar a guy would give me for $50. Not a fantastic one obviously, but a solid one. Maybe a bit too tough for a beginner action-wise. But I miss playing music and  I prefer to play as a group rather than a solo. I've always wanted to learn the guitar so why not? 

I picked it up like maybe once or twice a month for the last year year. I can mess around with five  or six chords with relative ease...faking my way through it.  I was a little disappointed and maybe it was my depression too because I've been struggling with that. 

In the last month or so, I've discovered that I love, absolutely love, folk music- and there's a lot of it that isn't the ""run for the hills"" type.  I've always played classical violin, and I can't get a banjo like I'd like to try- for the obvious reasons. So I was looking up some performances of some of my favorite songs and decided...I'm gonna actually do this. There's a ton of stuff on youtube. I know music and I have time. I feel more focused now.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with you for not wanting to have sex every day. Everyone has different sex drives. Some people have sex every day (wow) some people have sex once or twice a week (kinda typical after the initial OMG) or NOT AT ALL. 

Your boyfriend is being a manipulative jerk. In a relationship you need to respect each other's boundaries. How DARE he say anything about how you may or may not have treated past partners. It's one thing to comment on ""oh my ex and I used to go there a lot it was fun"" or ""my ex always hated that so I couldn't try it with her"" because our exes are natural and in our history and we need to have a mutual respect for each other's pasts. But he's using your past to manipulate you, he's trying to make you feel bad over sex. Everyone values it differently and instead of communicating a higher need in a mature and a way that makes you both feel like active partners, he's trying to guilt you into it. That is NOT okay. 

Guilt someone into their preferred ice cream/bubble bath after they've had a bad day. NEVER guilt someone into something as intimate and physiologically involved as sex.

AmItheAsshole,fi1bi0x,t3_f5x8m7,1582054445.0,"Dude NTA. 

The thing here is that your stepmom didn’t see you as a kid as much as she sees you as an adult. But in reality, you’re still kinda a kid. Learning how to “parent” is something that comes with experience and it’s not easy when you’re dealing with your own issues with your own mom. Your stepmom also has to deal with a lot and while it’s not an excuse to treat you poorly, it can help explain what’s going on in her head. She probably wants you to be back up, and still sees you as a kid, and that can be conflicting for her as well. She’s the adult she should handle it better but humans are bad at being human. 

I’d suggest some counseling to help you be able to talk to your stepmom without an anxiety attack."

I think it helped me. The way I describe it, was that my trauma was like a stack of books, papers, binders, and folders. I wasn’t carrying it logically. EMDR helped me put the papers back in the binders and carry it in a way that I wasn’t dropping everything all the time. 

It does take time though, and it can suck. Take it easy with it."
dogs,fhvvhwk,t1_fhvsg4f,1581901845.0,"I would like to point out before I go into this: I am not a vet I just have 10+ years of personal and about two years of professional experience with caring for dogs. 

Chicken and rice is considered a bland diet for humans and dogs. 

In general, a good indicator of your dogs health, physical or mental, is their feces. Sometimes your dogs bowl movements will be awkward for no obvious reason. As in they didn’t eat something they shouldn’t have, and they’re not obviously stressed or uncomfortable. Just have runny, or awkward bowl movements. 

If it’s just the consistency that’s an issue and not the color and/or your dogs behavior instead of making a trip to the vet for hundreds or thousands of dollars of tests, a bland diet can kinda reset them. Obviously if this lasts for a concerning amount of time or there are too many factors, get them to the vet. Recent experience with a dog I was watching: dog wasn’t keeping down food, water, had bloody bowls and seemed uncomfortable. That can indicate a LOT OF BIG PROBLEMS. So, we went to the vet and had one of the most stressful weeks of my life. 

My own dog has a somewhat chronic upset stomach. He gets a few days/week of chicken and rice every few months or so. He’s been to the vet for potential pancreatitis, parasites, and some other stuff. Everything comes back negative. 

We have a large backyard in a rural area. Who knows what he may have licked or sniffed, or if my parents leaving on their cruise freaked him out just enough to upset his tummy. We now have a stock of food that we always have on hand to try before we schlep him off to the vet- and somewhat obsessively communicate about what’s going on between the three of us when I’m at home. 

90% of the time bland diet works. 10% of the time he was anxious or ?¿?¿?. Nothing came back in the pathology and he‘d typically back to normal in a few days. 

Thus is the story of #7. Chicken and rice."

dogs,fht27cu,t3_f4s44g,1581869006.0,"In a vague order and guided towards puppy rather than dog: 

1) Consistency. Dogs are essentially toddlers who are very strong and can be quite dangerous 

2) Positive reinforcement. It will create a stronger bond than being low-key abusive.

3) Get that leash and collar on early. Get them used to it and to respect it. 

4) Play with the dogs food/paws/ears early on. Get them used to people handing those parts of their body.

5) You need to teach kids just as much as you need to teach your dog how to be around them. This is huge. By having a dog you immediately are responsible for the well being of those who are interested in your dog. 

6) Doggy socials. Look into puppy parties. Dog parks are iffy for puppies. Get your dog used to other dogs of all shapes and sizes- and also help them learn to walk away from a dog that's annoying them rather than engage. 

7) Always have chicken and rice ready to be made. 

8) Training is WORTH IT if you don't know what you're doing. Listen to the trainer. Listen to the groomer if you have a dog with a coat that needs care (aka goldendoodles).

9) Get all of the recommended vaccines just in case. You never know if you have an emergency and need a kennel. 

10) Play play play play. An active dog is typically a happy dog."
