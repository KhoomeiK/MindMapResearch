debtandcredithelp,fh3ih8h,t1_fh1i53o,1581269290.0,"Thank you, I have no idea how I managed to make it happen - with my rent, car payment, insurance, phone, etc - I literally have just enough and maybe $70 leftover a month that I'm ""paying myself first"" when I get paid - so I take that money out and grocery shop right away with cash. The food thing is also teaching me to be more frugal with not spending on takeout and coffee too."
debtandcredithelp,fh0i3c0,t3_f0jr6r,1581204130.0,"I am in your shoes - 20k in credit card debt myself. Also never really learned about finances until it was too late, just like you it sounds like with the shopping when I was younger, then taught myself as much as possible about money and credit. I have an anxiety disorder and the debt makes my anxiety so much worse. 

What I just started doing as of last month is: I looked at all 9 of my credit cards that have balances on them and looked at the statements and where it says ""if you make no additional charges using this card and each month you pay"" - minimum payment - it'll take 19 years to pay off (unfortunately this is real for me). Compared to the same comment with the higher payment amount below that - it'll be paid off in about 3 years. 

So for all 9 of my cards, I took that higher amount that each statement said and put that in my monthly budget. My goal is to have all 9 cards paid off in the next 3 years through this method. 

I don't know if this is helpful or even advisable but since I relate to your post 100% I wanted to share. Good luck, I know how hard this is."
AskReddit,f0fpedx,t3_d4lya4,1568587131.0,My boyfriend and I have been together for over four years and everyone in our family and our friends know we don’t plan on getting married although we’re committed. Every single time I see my family they ask when we’ll get married.
AskWomen,f0f9592,t3_d4l8go,1568579846.0,"I had to learn to stop apologizing all the time. In my 2 previous relationships I would get yelled at for things that either weren’t my fault, sometimes even things that were their fault, or even not a problem at all and I would apologize constantly. My current relationship (over four years now) and I still do it when it’s not necessary and my boyfriend has to tell me to stop apologizing."
bipolar2,eosujvh,t1_eosquq9,1558829513.0,"I've been in this loop since I was 18, I'm 30 now. I'm really trying to get better with it. I hear you with the self help shit, I can't tell you how many books I got, on top of work out clothes and sneakers, and work clothes that I never ended up wearing. Lately i'm trying to tell myself/convince myself I will never wear it, if it doesn't fit now don't buy it, all sorts of things. I'm getting a little better now with the clothes but talk to me in 6 months to see if that changed lol. It's so fucking annoying tbh I hate it. As far as your surgery goes, i'm really sorry to hear about that - I hope your feet are okay for now? I'm wondering if you can talk to the billing office people for the doctor/hospital and see if they'll do a self-pay discounted rate or something like that? (i work in billing) i don't know if that would be possible but it's worth a shot. Hope you're doin okay though!"

bipolar2,eodmddm,t3_breuej,1558476049.0,"I was at work today and my mind wouldn't stop racing at all - so many post-it notes of random thoughts and things I can do and take care of outside of work and my arms were starting to tingle like I just needed to go somewhere and do something, anything instead of work! and very very tired like an hour later, I hate it so much."
