SkincareAddiction,foujhsi,t3_g9g91e,1588085209.0,"I need help with my routine order and I'd appreciate some input. First I'll list the products I own in no particular order:

Micellar water (Balea brand, water based product and Bioderma Sensibio, water based product)

Sunscreen (alternating between Sun Bears Strong Super Plus, Sundance Kids and Sundance Anti Age Fluid)

Moisturiser (currently testing Roche Posay Toleriane Sensitive Creme, water based)

Balea Aqua Moisturising Serum (water based - I've used this as a moisturiser for a while)

TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5

Eye cream (Balea Q10 anti wrinkle eye cream, water based, Balea Urea eye cream, water based, Isana Age Performance eye cream, water based)

Exfoliants (TO Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, TO AHA 30 & BHA 2 Peeling Solution max 2x/week, Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant)

The Ordinary Argireline Solution

The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in Squalane

The Ordinary Alpha Lipoic Acid 5% (can be used 2-3 times a week)

Different water based ampoules, sheet masks, anti spot masks

Yeauty Eye Pad Mask

BPO 5% as needed

I'm considering incorporating another cleanser FYI.

I've been in a skincare slump and haven't followed a real routine. I currently do micellar water and sunscreen in the AM and then micellar water and eye cream in the PM, TO Peeling Solution about once a week and then sheet masks and the eye pad masks here and there.

So right now I'm thinking:

AM 

-Micellar water 

-(Moisturiser when using Sun Bears sunscreen)

-Sunscreen

Note: The two other listed sunscreens are kind of oily/sticky and I'd prefer not to use a moisturiser with them.

Question: When using actives and acids in the PM, is using micellar water in the AM enough?

PM - this is where it gets tricky for me

-Cleansing (I assume I should incorporate another cleansing product on top of micellar water?

-Exfoliants (particularly PC BHA and TO Glycolic Acid - which order?)

-TO Hyaluronic Acid

-Moisturiser 
(-Eye cream)

Questions:
-Which step is the TO Retinol 0.5% in Squalane? 
-TO Argireline Solution conflicts with direct acids. Can I use it with TO Retinol 0.5%? If so, which order?
-TO Alpha Lipoic Acid conflicts with pretty much everything, so I guess on days I want to use it, I only cleanse, apply the product, then moisturise?
-Which step is BPO that I use sometimes?
-Where would I incorporate a moisturising ampoule? 
-Where would I incorporate face masks or eye pad masks?

I feel like I own a lot of unnecessary and gimmicky products, so I hope establishing a routine will help me find products to focus on as well as deciding what I can toss. I also know eye creams aren't really necessary when you have a good moisturiser."

Also, this isn't directed at you or your boyfriend, but I always see men claiming they don't like women wearing makeup... until they actually see a woman with zero makeup. I also wonder if the process of putting on an elaborate full face of makeup plays a role in this. Woman spending time on (seemingly) herself = bad in their eyes?

She posted a story saying she's bringing her own snacks (including a huge water bottle filled with diet coke) to the cinema to save money... which is so normal, but so not Skalla-like?"
blogsnark,f91po8q,t3_e1qus6,1574997389.0,"Those stories on Megan's profile make me cringe. Zach is so awkward on camera, I feel bad for him. The story with the cake, when she's done singing happy birthday, they look at each other and to me it looks like she wants to kiss him, but he turns away his face to blow out the candles. Ughhh. There's no chemistry between them."
SkincareAddiction,f8zowf3,t3_e0u7z0,1574963250.0,Rant: TO Salicylic Acid is sold out everywhere here (Germany) except on some websites that overprice it and knockoffs from questionable eBay sellers 😑 I also checked in store (at Douglas) and they didn't even have the price tag on the shelf or an empty space. I wonder if there's a distribution issue going on? Has anyone else noticed this?
GenderCritical,f8nogme,t1_f8mog5y,1574648973.0,"Unfortunately, ""some women just love having sex, why shouldn't they make money with something they enjoy (like a hobby)"" isn't that rare an argument in favour of prostitution. It's always presented as prostitution being a logical next step for women with high sexual activity."
GenderCritical,f8no3qo,t3_e135kt,1574648728.0,"Maybe on some level they are aware that prostitutes are a disadvantaged group, but of course they can't say that because their entire defense of the sex buying industry would fall apart? 

I never understood the term SWERF. Radical feminists fight for a system in which disadvantaged women aren't forced into being raped for money."

SkincareAddiction,f7e4r57,t3_dvmsk5,1573646427.0,"Routine:
AM
Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water
Balea Moisturising Serum or Sebamed Clear Skin Care Gel
Sunscreen (I alternate between three, SPF 50)

PM
Balea Cleansing Milk
Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water
TO Glycolic Acid Toning Solution (1x/week TO AHA BHA Peeling Solution instead)
Moisturiser same as AM


So four days ago and two days ago, I used the TO 30% Vitamin C suspension in the AM before moisturiser. I've used it before and was looking to reintroduce it. The strength has been fine every time I used it. Two days ago, it stung more than usual so I put on some more moisturiser. The stinging subsided except under my eyes. When I looked in the mirror that night, the creases I have under my eyes were red and irritated. I used a moisturising sheet mask with aloe vera and my skin calmed down, everything was fine...
Except when I looked in the mirror yesterday, there were two tiny new creases starting to form right below my creases... could this be a reaction to the irritation? Based on the instructions I thought vit C was okay to apply in the eye area."
GenderCritical,f79qogz,t3_duqoix,1573513160.0,"I stumbled upon a paper about transsexuality and gender dysphoria by psychiatrists published in a scientific journal recently. They are involved in a university research team about sexual health, so they can be considered experts.

I've only skimmed it so far, but they say it is doubtful that genital surgery should be considered standard treatment for dysphoria and that post mortem MRIs have failed to show a difference in the central nervous system of gender dysphoric patients.

If anyone's interested, I can post a summary (it's in German) when I get the chance to read more closely!"

If it's required I don't expect Rachel to go against the grain, obviously, but posting a picture like that on the internet is a different story (to me). I know she doesn't mean any harm, but I wish all the mommy bloggers would consider who they want looking at the pictures and who might actually see them."
blogsnark,f72lad6,t3_drnm2m,1573367403.0,"I probably sound pearl clutchy, but I'm weirded out by Rachel's most recent picture of Isla. People in the comments there claim the makeup is totally normal for dance kids even for girls Isla's age, so I believe them (but I do find it weird), but the pose? The look on her face? The outfit? All of that combined? I don't get why mommy bloggers are so willing to hand fodder to creeps. It's all just so sickening to me after a German mommy blogger very openly did not care about actual paedophiles spreading and commenting on pictures of her children on another (public) platform."

And is there a term other than prostitution and ""sex work"" that I could use? I'm planning on writing my Bachelor's thesis (Sociology) on prostitution. When I discussed my ideas with my professor, she made sure to inform me that I will find a lot of literature under ""sex work"". I am not sure if she considers the term prostitution biased, but I definitely do not want to describe it as sex work. I have to stay in a neutral position, but I'd like to have very strong arguments against prostitution."
