One particular mate has a brother in jail right now, and a dad who has been in and out. He was raised to never trust or respect authority. It is engrained and hard to unlearn. 

It’s not hard to become known to the police in small towns just because of your last name too. Some of us in our group growing up were never given a chance by the police, they were always written up for public drinking and weed offences, we were all doing it but some of us would get lucky and were let off a lot of the time.
