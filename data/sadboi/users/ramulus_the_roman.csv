basically, when you have pressure in le chat's principle, you add up the moles of the gaseous reactants and products. once that's done, the reaction will shift towards the side with more moles of gas whenever you increase the pressure. pressure is a special thing; it doesn't behave like volume or temperature. if you wanna know why then use the gas laws, bc there's a proof in there somewhere"
