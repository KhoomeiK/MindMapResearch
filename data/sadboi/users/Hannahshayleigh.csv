birthcontrol,fmal22w,t3_fu3lrq,1585897858.0,"I had the same thing happen to me when I first got mine, I was the worst pain I‚Äôve ever been in. I went to my OB who inserted my IUD Mirena ad she said my body was trying to reject it since it was a foreign object in my cervix and not a baby. Also since I‚Äôve never had a kid my body was trying to figure out what the hell was in my body. it went on for about 6 months for me and suddenly completely stopped, spotting and cramps. But let me tell you I was hunched over sobbing pale as could be because it hurt so bad I had to call out of work because I couldn‚Äôt move. I‚Äôve now had mine for a little over a year now and it‚Äôs been absolutely amazing since all my pain had stopped. I don‚Äôt get any periods and once in a while I‚Äôll get the occasional cramping and ‚Äúspotting‚Äù that only last like an hour. But my advice is just take pain killers and warm compress like you would with your regular period but if the pain is to intense go to the doctor."

AskReddit,exn0qe6,t1_exmm1nv,1566443581.0,So pretty much I used to work a fast food place. The way they ‚Äúpre cooked‚Äù and like ‚Äúpre cut‚Äù the food was disgusting. They cut everything and pre cooked hamburgers and hotdogs and just about everything else and just kept it in the freezer with a label of the date it was cooked and when it came time to serve it they‚Äôd cook it AGAIN and just warm it up to a ‚Äúserve able‚Äù temperature. The lettuce and tomato‚Äôs would be like rotten and have a absolute horrid smell and they‚Äôd still put it on the food. The way they made the onion rings was NASTY. They‚Äôd get just regular corn meal and city water from the faucet we‚Äôd wash our hands in and mix it together and dipped the frozen no good onions in it.. the ice had cockroaches in it and they‚Äôd do nothing about it. There was times where we‚Äôd find eggs that looked like the ice itself. When someone got a customers order wrong they‚Äôd scrap everything off all the condiments into the other condiments and REUSE the burger or hot dog for the next order.. if something fell onto the DIRTY floor they‚Äôd still use it.. It was just very scary as well and scarring also the way they wouldn‚Äôt clean anything once it was closing time you‚Äôd think the place would be shut down... the store was place #2 in the TOP 5 in the region...... the company loved how business went about and how procedures were done....
