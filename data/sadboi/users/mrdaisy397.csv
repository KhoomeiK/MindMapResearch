shoppingaddiction,fml1zie,t1_fmkdgqx,1586176459.0,Me too! And then I worry it will be sold if I leave it too long and I am so obsessed with buying it or not that I just do it! Maybe I need to start knitting. BUT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER PURCHASE HAHAHAHA
shoppingaddiction,fml1vky,t1_fmkftom,1586176371.0,"I am also so attached to them!!! It‚Äôs such a strange thing! And hundreds is not ridiculous lol I easily have a collection of crystals that are around 100. I could probably sell them, but I love them! Usually this time of year I‚Äôm prepping for a flower obsession but I discovered the world of houseplants before the season hit hahaha. I feel depressed about the money too but then I just love my collections so it help me justify it I guess."

tattoos,fknkkue,t1_fkmd9t4,1584368021.0,I‚Äôm sure with shading they can make the line work better. Just make sure you communicate!! Good luck and post a picture after!
tattoos,fkmm5ce,t1_fkmd9t4,1584332627.0,"Its such a commitment, I get it. I have an appointment next week to fill in a couple spots on my sleeve and my artist likes to kind of do it in his style and wild colors so I normally have to have a lot of open conversations with him beforehand and during lol."
tattoos,fkmcz4y,t3_fjdixd,1584326040.0,"Usually once everything is filled in it will change a lot, right? Once I added color to mine it was very different. Also, TELL YOUR ARTIST. Don‚Äôt be afraid to tell them how you want it. It will be on your for the rest of your life!!! If it‚Äôs just the outline then they can go over it with color or shading and cover up why you don‚Äôt like."
Spravato,fjyraln,t1_fjwf8yy,1583702896.0,"No need to apologize!!!! I absolutely am grateful for your response, and I totally agree!! Actually, after my 9th treatment things have been a little better! I actually went to my classes and my work study job (thankfully that makes attendance a bit more flexible, since it‚Äôs not exactly a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job haha) and I‚Äôve been able to get out of my car at the grocery store and get a couple things. My doctor extended the twice weekly doses since I was about to start going only once a week. I even went out for a jog today for the first time in at least a year. I am hopeful again, don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll last but here‚Äôs to hoping!!!! I am SO GRATEFUL to have people who actually feel the same as me!!! And that you have had some success is incredibly helpful."
Spravato,fjp8lqs,t1_fjkwls8,1583544511.0,"I did exactly this, and noticed a difference at least with the 45 minutes afterwards. ü§ûüèºü§ûüèºü§ûüèºü§ûüèº THANK YOU for sharing your knowledge!!!"
Spravato,fjp8guv,t1_fjnkxuu,1583544413.0,"Oddly enough when I went back that day my doctor had been to a seminar and she had me hold my other nostril while spraying one, and we waited the five minutes. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in my head or if it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs my 9 th session but I feel a difference. And the experience was also quite different."
Spravato,fjhhi5e,t1_fjgshff,1583348216.0,I will do this!! I administer it myself but I get all anxious and self conscious when she‚Äôs standing there waiting lol. I also read the doses are supposed to be 5 minutes apart? Do you do that?

gardening,fjf1o02,t3_fd4hi1,1583282400.0,I had a lid on mine and kept them in it until they were almost too big. The problem I ran into was getting them OUT of that little ice tray thing. I destroyed an entire tray. I recommend using a spoon or tool.

Spravato,fjei7is,t1_fjdr5d2,1583272144.0,"Thank you. I actually saw a study near me very recently. I‚Äôve promised my husband and therapist that I‚Äôd at least finish this, so I plan on talking to my doctor today about where to go from here.  At least there are things happening out there. ü§ûüèºü§ûüèº I wish you the best as well!"
Spravato,fjehn59,t1_fjdqnv1,1583271833.0,"Yeah. Idk, I‚Äôm just leaving from my dose and it kicked my ass today. Maybe it‚Äôs been too long in between? Idfk."
Spravato,fjdka01,t1_firiz6k,1583254249.0,"Same. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs making any difference for me and I‚Äôm also back to the dark hole. I‚Äôm frustrated and sick of sitting there for two hours. I‚Äôve had 7 treatments and all she keeps saying is it may take time, eVeRyOnE iS dIfFeReNt. üôÑ"

Damnthatsinteresting,fgrg4zm,t3_f03ix6,1581045983.0,It‚Äôs odd that the cheaper one had less. So the one that‚Äôs more natural must have more actual orange in it. Hmm. Interesting.

depression,fgpde07,t3_enrs4c,1581002529.0,Literally feeling so bad today that my best friend told me I needed to try and articulate it for my husband so he doesn‚Äôt think I hate him and I felt like such a drama queen. I even asked him if he thought I was making it up. Because I feel like I am just sitting in it or choosing not to ‚Äúshake it off‚Äù.  I am so fucking grateful for this thread right now. It has been such a dark week. I literally feel like I‚Äôm just waiting for every day to be over so I can move on to the next.
