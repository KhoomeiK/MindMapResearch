Focus on sword and fighting skills first because you do A LOT. You also want to get your hidden blade to one hit kill when you can - it makes killing baddies later in the game much much easier.

My suggestion is don’t try to do all the side quests. Pick 2-3 after each few main quests so you level up a bit more, google some of the better ones, and stick to those, at least until you beat the game. If you try and do everything during the main story you’ll get so lost you forget the story."

personalfinance,fqe4wx2,t1_fqe4sha,1589301806.0,I agree - teach outside the south. Or a private school. After you teach a few years here it’s not too bad money wise but it’s hard to get past the first few.
personalfinance,fqe3wk9,t1_fqe3aga,1589301339.0,"The south is bad for teachers. Yes the cost of living is low, but not that low.

I’m well aware that teachers do not go this above and beyond, and to me that’s a problem. Why we want teachers to go into class every day, do the bare minimum, get a check, and leave is beyond me. That’s not how we created great students in the future. That’s how we create a lazy society of kids who do the minimum to get by.

I do not ever encourage people to go into teaching for the money, just like I wouldn’t for nurses. You need to feel called and committed. That’s why this profession isn’t right for OP unless he wants to be. That was my sole point.

Even if teachers don’t work twelve hours days (although I think more so than you think they do) they work far more than to be paid $30K/yr IMO.

Again, I’d encourage you to shadow a teacher for a day. Think you’ll be surprised. Also if there’s some grand conspiracy that teaching is actually easy money, please tell me where I messed up."
personalfinance,fqe2k10,t1_fqe1hrb,1589300712.0,"Why would me being a debate coach be a hobby? It requires hours of prep, traveling to competitions, working with students one-on-one, to make them better. I do it for them, not for me. Same with my other club, which is Model U.N. Both are year around.

I get approximately 100-120 emails a day. Some are junk, some don’t need a reply, a good chunk do. I have many students and parents who require regular updates, I have to email administration and other faculty about students progress or issues, I have to fill out and submit daily lesson plans, I have emails about debate club, model U.N, baseball, band, all of which I help with at some level.

I’m sure plenty of teachers don’t put in the extra time I do, I’m saying I wish they did because students get more for it. I’m also not complaining, I was stating a fact in regards to the original topic of this post that 30K a year, even eight hour days, isn’t going to help repay debt that large. He needs another alternative option.

Finally, I was a TA in college as well, grading there is much different then grading as a teacher. For one you’re grading college students, who need less feedback and guidance and generally do better, it means you spend less time making comments, or finding time to talk with them individually, then you might for a struggling freshmen in high school. Additionally, my tests and papers are for history, which is nuanced, and in essay form. If you grade that fast and think it’s easy, I’m sure a local school near you is hiring today.

I think a general rule of thumb is don’t critique a job you’ve never done. If you’d really like to know, when COVID is over, I’m sure a local school would be happy to let you shadow a teacher for a day if you’re that intrigued.

personalfinance,fqdzvv2,t1_fqdz6q9,1589299443.0,"You didn’t look in the replies like I mentioned.

I get to school an hour before classes to tutor students and reply to emails. I stay an hour after to do the same. (Some students prefer one or the other depending on how they get to and from school). After the hour of tutoring I typically have 1-2 hours of activities I do, either coaching or being an advisor to the two clubs I manage. Technically not a part of my teaching job, but I don’t get paid extra for it, and it’s important for students, incase your knit picky.

And have you tried to grade 120 (that’s how many students I have) tests or papers? They take hours. Probably not 20, but definitely 5-10 per week minimum when I have them, which is most weeks (some are less, some are more).

Hopefully that answers your questions. I by no means am saying I work 12 hour days every day, but it’s more often than not I arrive at 6:30AM and leave around 6:30PM.

I like Black Flag but all the ports look and feel the same to an extent and I don’t want to chase meaningless collectibles for hours, I just don’t have the time if I can’t justify that."
NASCAR,fp5w3wh,t1_fp5vpuz,1588341181.0,He is.
assassinscreed,fp5w307,t1_fp5uvsi,1588341166.0,Interesting. The story is good but the gameplay is super repetitive which hold it back to me.
assassinscreed,fp5usr5,t1_fp5uqx6,1588340381.0,"Nope, it definitely does. It’s weird. One’s graphics are oddly superior that 2 or Brotherhood. Revelation finally beats it"
assassinscreed,fp5uodz,t1_fp5uc06,1588340307.0,No worries. I’ve been replaying the series and have had this issue at least once in every single game. 3 Remastered was the worst. I had to quit the game about 10 times.
assassinscreed,fp5ufyu,t3_gbexyi,1588340159.0,"I’m replaying all the Assassin’s Creed games right now to prepare for Valhalla. I started a month again ago and am now halfway through Black Flag.

Like you I don’t have a ton of time or willpower but with quarantine I figured why not. I’m basically playing just the main story and doing a few side stuff here and there so I’m a bit higher leveled, have more gear, before the end sections.

The first 3 Ezio games I finished with 2-3 days of gameplay each (10-12 hours each). After that they get a bit longer. AC3 took me 5 days and I’m 3 days into Black Flag and only halfway so looking at a week. Unity and Syndicate are about as long as Black Flag but take a little less time because there’s less time traversing the map.

Origins and Odyssey though are massive. I’m debating replaying them because they’d easily take 30-40 hours to just rush through the main game but I likely will after a little break after Syndicate. I may play on NG+ so it’s a little easier and I’m not as worried about leveling and gear.

The point of that ramble was the first 7 games (I would include Rogue before Unity too) aren’t actually that long if you just want the main story. Some, like Revelations and Rogue, could honestly be beat in a day if you went ham on it. If you didn’t want to play them all, I’d play the Ezio Collection, Black Flag, Rogue, and Unity. With that you skip AC3 and Syndicate, but IMO they’re good games and you went that far so why not add them on.

Origins is definitely a must. Odyssey is good but less so than Origins, you could watch a short movie on the plot on YouTube and be fine.

Sorry for my rambling! Have fun!"
assassinscreed,fp5tbrb,t3_gbhjl1,1588339431.0,Maybe I’m stupid but this feature hardly ever worked for me. I’d set it and within a few seconds my horse would be down a wrong road or run into something that stopped it.
assassinscreed,fp5t57v,t3_gbhwvi,1588339312.0,It’s a bug. Just restart the game once you get an auto save and it’ll go away.
personalfinance,fovpzrw,t1_fovpobo,1588105527.0,"Sigh. That’s what I’ve been saying but apparently her “dignity” is worth more than whatever money she’ll make by staying a bit longer and then unemployment. I told her nothings dignified when I have to drop out and we can’t afford to eat but, she didn’t like that. Thanks for the input though."
personalfinance,fovptma,t1_fovpr14,1588105443.0,"Oh good to know. So if they just fired her and didn’t provide a reason, she could still qualify for unemployment?"

assassinscreed,fosnopm,t3_g9cjp7,1588034323.0,"Just finished Liberation and I’m on the same track you are. I agree for the most part, although I love AC3. Maybe it’s because I’m a history teacher and I geek out."

assassinscreed,foqirqx,t1_foqihw7,1587994511.0,Oh I think you’re right. I had the Ezio Collection and didn’t even think about that.
assassinscreed,foqhllx,t3_g8kykp,1587993749.0,"I started this three weeks ago and am starting Black Flag today. Notably, I skipped AC1. I remember the story of that game and it’s just so repetitive I couldn’t.

One thing about this journey is you make a lot of early progress and then stall around 3. The games just get much longer after that so you spend more time in each. Nothing wrong with that, just interesting.

I think after Black Flag I’m going to take a break for a week and come back. I’m too excited for Black Flag though bc I didn’t appreciate it the first time around and just powered through it. Gonna take my time."
assassinscreed,foqgrek,t1_foq7zv0,1587993191.0,Don’t they add like a “separate flying mission” after the game ends in Forli off the lighthouse? It’s not as fun but it exists.
assassinscreed,foqgikz,t1_fopysz8,1587993026.0,Man you hit the nail on the head with AC2. Ive been replaying the entire franchise and I saw that mission and just about rage quit. I wanted to move on to Brotherhood so bad and knew I was close and then was slammed with an hour grind. So annoying.
assassinscreed,foqgaon,t3_g8vfze,1587992873.0,"I. Freaking. Hate. Optional. Objectives. I just don’t have enough time to be bothered with them because some are ridiculous but they trigger my OCD and prohibit me from 100% some games.

I’ll admit I get the point, but I’ve enjoyed AC games much more now that they’re gone.

Also I love the modern day lore but the bit between Black Flag and Syndicate spent in Abstergo was really just annoying. Very few good things came from that."

If there’s one thing I’ve learned about high level college applicants (no offense) they’re academic smart which is great for succeeding in a structured atmosphere. Not much anywhere else."

assassinscreed,fnr0phm,t1_fnr0ewp,1587176502.0,This is the best explanation I’ve heard. Thank you!
assassinscreed,fnqt91r,t1_fnqsxl2,1587171724.0,"I agree. I’d be down with a modern one, even if it was a spin-off. Or maybe even a game that focuses more heavily in modern day but still has elements of the past that can appease those fans as well. The thing I liked about Revelations is all the Desmond stuff was optional, but if you chose to do it, it added a LOT."
assassinscreed,fnqsmqu,t1_fnqsgl6,1587171348.0,Okay that’s a little more detail than I remembered (hence much replay). I’d still like to see some sort of continuation of the modern story or just dropped altogether but I assume everyone’s in that boat.
