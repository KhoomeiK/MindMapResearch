On your birthday no less. I think all of us should note to be kinder to ourselves, and we could potentially be in good hands being with ourselves.

My ""fishing"" is actually computer programming, same deal with isolation, learning curve, keeps my mind focused, and what not. Just not in nature, but that's what hiking is for...with the occasional friend... if you catch my drift.

Have a great day."
depression,ew6kacd,t1_ew6c3d0,1565173597.0,"Got to say, after reading this entire thing a few of your points stuck out that are relevant to my situation. Since not everything needs to align. I'm also not a doctor, but lets just say I'm a keen observer. (damn, your tone rubs off on me quite well, kudos) Just thought I'd share some thoughts for those who care to read.

2. Only reason why I think big change is difficulty, is that it requires one to overcome fear or self-esteem issues. It's kind of hard to explain to someone you need to be handheld because the common perception now is ""you need to get your shit together"". I'd argue it's true too (it's what I grew up with) but if we were really taking mental health seriously, I'd hope people understand if someone is asking for help, they probably really need it. To put it in my perspective, If I ask for help I've learned a lot of people say, ""how can I help"" and a response of ""I don't know what you can do"" or ""you can't do anything"" isn't helpful either. The dreaded, it goes both ways, really kicks me in the ass when I realize people want to help but I'm just stubborn. Which relates to...

5. You're basically saying don't be a dick. Haha. I mean... sometimes I feel like I'm so sorry for myself that no one understands and honestly, it's probably true they don't understand me. But when I'm in a funk, take things too personal, or have some issue going on, anything that isn't my own thoughts sounds like a threat or the same generic BS people say when they try to help. Maybe I don't need to be so closed off and actually listen to people. Gee....that sounds neat doesn't it?

8. I've been lucky enough to recently have gotten a supervisor who is closer to my age and can see the world similarly to mine. Regardless of whether the ""care"" is there, she at least knows the struggle. I've wanted to change jobs for a while now, but was never in a situation where I could ask for help or had the courage to. It's common for people to do so in my field and yet here am I feeling lost. Glad I'm where I'm at now, but really the fear of rejection is the only thing I need to get over at this point.

9. I know I'm selfish with time, just funny because I hear volunteering helps a lot. My post says things about being open minded, but allow me to be selfish in some aspects of the change process haha.

10. I think you hit the nail on the head for this one. I hate talking to people, don't necessarily care because I don't think it's worth it. But when I observe others, they become closer by talking about problems and before this post, I always hated how people would bring up gossip or issues to me because I found them petty. I never thought of it as a way for people to connect by wanting to confide in me. I know some basic psychological theory, not sure which one, stated if people experience trauma together they have the chance to get closer, which is sounds true. But I think I've always been the type of person to believe if I didn't personally experience it, why does it matter? Yah, shared/related experiences blah blah common ground... sigh...reading into this, I probably just sound like someone that needs to work on communication huh?

11. I'm glad someone can confirm the strength of apologizing quick. The only thing that sucks is if someone doesnt accept your apology, there are people out there who wont, but I guess as long as you are sincere in that,  it's there problem if they want to hold a grudge.

12. I interpret this last point as you saying, don't take things to seriously. Now childhood trauma might be a determining factor as to the way I respond to certain situations, but that's beside the point. This relates to not being a dick to others, but when we're in a depressive state I think we forget how it negatively affects the people around us, and as much as I want to feel sorry about myself... like anything in life that involves people, everyone involved needs to take some part of the healing process. Which doesn't make sense since I feel like shit all the time, but .... why should I make others feel like shit too? Especially when they really are...just trying to help. You've given me new perspective in throwing people a bone, but as I'm approaching the end of this post, I realize I'm the one that bites the hands of those who feed me. 

Overall I appreciate the tone of your post. ""Fuck all"" attitudes are great (if this is the tone you have.... idk but I feel cheery) and I feel like I just need to kick myself out of this funk. Tired of small changes that seem temporary with fear being my only set back. While I do notice the changes and the potential of a new way of viewing life. The solutions I've shared for myself,  sound easy but that path will take time. I'm trying to do active change and have the courage to take shared ownership of why I'm the way I am."
depression,ew58tn4,t3_cmmstv,1565130422.0,"I actually think it was nice your coworker noticed. I know I actively avoid people when I'm at work, but when someone can see what you're going through I can't help but want to reach out.

When I first started playing, I remember how intentional I was with this game. Seeing this question made me look back on my ""Obtained Prizes"" list and I noticed in the most recent months I've just been winning things because I can, not because I actually wanted them. So, it made me a little emotional. In addition, this was also my first exposure to the Sumikkogurashi series which I've since fallen in love with and has become a fairly prominent hobby for me to follow the brand and their social media (they have a movie coming soon around Nov. 2019). 

However, winning this was a downward slope into this ever-complicated relationship with Toreba due to spending and what not, but either way. I love the entire experience. Haha. Thank you for asking the question and I'm glad to share! :D"

I'm pretty sure you need to have a card registered at all times on there so I'd suggest putting the pre-paid card on there first, and then removing your other one. You are correct in that putting a card on an account requires a purchase after your first initial registered card.

Toreba,epfd2u8,t3_buokno,1559194394.0,"I can share some thoughts on your questions based on my experience. I started playing around August 2018

1. Free play tickets always had some end date and it normally lasted a few months. So far, they never got rid of it so I hope that stays the same. On this note, the 10th and 20th of the month used to give 3 free tickets but now it only gives 2. I think it happened sometime late 2018.
2. I certainly hope not, but paying for shipping used to only cost 10,000TP. So you can see it already increased, which it's currently at 20,000TP.
3. I've only seen higher reservation lists on machines that had ""popular""items or brand new ones. So if it becomes a regular thing that's cool, but I wouldn't really see the point of doing that since people will be fighting for a spot regardless.
4. I don't see them putting something like this. This seems more like a personal interest for each person, but I'd like to hear the opinions of other people on this matter.

Hope my input helps :3"
