AskReddit,fmm05hp,t3_fvzqic,1586196337.0,"Omg this one just happened to me - absolutely mortifying. 

I was recently in Las Vegas for an extremely huge trade show with my last company (no I was not fired because of this). This trade show was INVITATION ONLY. When I received the invitation to go I was thrilled that me, an engineer, could actually go to the largest trade show for our company and be with the product managers, business development managers, Vice Presidents, etc (I was trying to move up). 

So we go to dinner and we are at dinner talking about homes. They live in the Midwest and I in California. I speak to how I was able to furnish my home with all free items and how happy I was because I was finally able to get rid of these two hideous couches. 

I go to pull up the couches and show the product manager the couches, no problem breeze over it new talking to them as he‚Äôs looking at my phone I scrolled over and ended up showing an ENTIRE ROW of images of me in lingerie. 

I thought it was best to play it off as in it didn‚Äôt happen. 

TLDR: tried to show my coworker/way higher up associate a picture of my couches and ended up showing him a row of me in lingerie before the couches at a work dinner"

Many times (in my area) the berries and fruit are organic as they come from local farms with excess. 

I make sure to wash everything vigorously, but the produce is great quality. I can get 1-2 weeks worth of produce for under $20!! I discovered this in college and it helped tremendously when I moved out \*officially\* on my own in times of struggle.
