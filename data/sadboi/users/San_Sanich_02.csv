I wish I could give you a better advice, but I am only 17 myself.  
What I can say, however, is that I have gone through almost the exact same thing. It definitely isn't easy to live with such a thing, and it is variable. I am glad you're still here. Thank you for continuing to fight despite your thoughts and the emptiness.  
What helped for me is self-inspections. I began journalling. I began to look into myself, noting behaviours. I tried therapy for a bit, but I noticed the only one who can fix it is myself. That being said, you should probably give it a try for a few sessions, see how it makes you feel.  
I noticed for myself any form of distraction works. Working out, drawing, finding new music, writing. You can definitely use those to see if they can be coping mechanisms.  
I cannot guarantee when the darkness will lift up, but all I can say is that, well..

I hope it lifts up soon. Thank you for still being here, and thank you for being strong.
