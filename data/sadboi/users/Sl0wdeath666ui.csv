It seems to pop up in very conquest based societies the most, as celtic tribes and native americans were particularly respectful of their women. However, there is proof it can also arise in highly developed societies, for example there are many examples of matrilineal inheritance in indonesian societies.

One of the most interesting things i find was that this wasn't *equality,* per se. Women and men were still very restricted to gender roles, and you were rarely allowed outside of that. Even in the societies that embraced gender identity you were still expected to behave a certain way dependent on your identified gender, even if it wasn't your biological. The difference is how much real power women had, and how much say they had in political and purchasing decisions within the home and society."

If you suspected someone of a serious mental illness even if it was exceedingly rare and very little chance... would you want to be the person who encourages it? If it was someone with depression, you wouldn't exactly want to encourage that thinking.

And actors play characters, and acting is pretty close to how you use these personalities. But terms like Persona and personalities are more normal and accepted, and accurately describe your situation. For paracosm, many writers just call them worlds or universes. Just look at the discussion posts where people talk about aspects of their world.

Besides, the fact you even know those terms implies you have some experience with mental illnesses of that nature, as most people don't know them, and they are used in very singular situations to describe dangerous behaviors. While this may be because of family or friends or less serious illnesses, it will still alert quite a lot of people.

It may be disappointing to see that this is all people are focusing on, but they are doing it entirely out of kindness rather than anything else.
