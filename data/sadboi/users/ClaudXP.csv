The100,f92tq7j,t1_f90pln1,1575041509.0,I love Kane.  I didn't know he died and now I'm sad.
classicwow,f81uh0f,t1_f81ryyy,1574177615.0,Its just really weird because generally when the term exploit is used in video games it means a bug or something the developers plan to fix.  Thanks for explaining!
classicwow,f81neca,t3_dye9s7,1574172682.0,Can someone explain to me why this is a rule?  Seems like they just made the map poorly if jumping on an object is an exploit.
BlackPeopleTwitter,f6k5ei7,t1_f6jbdrl,1572905291.0,"OK, but what about bill gates?    I think it's possible to become a millionaire.  Billionaire is a different story."

anime_irl,f4hdeej,t1_f4h8w66,1571590438.0,"I don't even know what the anime is so maybe not in this exact case I just mean in general.  Also ""why are you booing me? I'm right."""
anime_irl,f4gk6kc,t3_dkfwga,1571581867.0,I hate in anime actually making a move on a girl is such a big deal. Lol.  Probably has something to do with the reduced amount of sex in Japan.
MemeTemplatesOfficial,f24spza,t1_f24nqpg,1569959509.0,"Sorry to say, but the electoral college is completely fair.  If it did not exist my state would have to pretty much fall at the knees to California and that's the last thing the country needs."
Anxiety,f1kcq6k,t3_d9el7p,1569534260.0,Interesting how many different things ppl can be anxious about.  Mine is  related to death or health problems.  As well as failing something big.
Humanoidencounters,f1j4t8n,t3_d9f902,1569518736.0,Why does stuff like this exist now?  These weren't really popular until the creation of the rake.  It was just a creepy pasta.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  I feel like people are just bullshitting 99% of the time.
politics,f1en4ru,t1_f1emw44,1569425957.0,I really don't care if any president did this.  He's trying to get some shit on his opponent.  Every politician does this.
Anxiety,f18d110,t3_d85862,1569255951.0,I unfortunately haven't experienced that.  I live in the middle of nowhere kansas so you can pee anywhere in between towns.

Anxiety,f0szrsj,t1_f0sis4b,1568913438.0,That's sucks.  People just don't understand and they really can't.  The good people are the ones available to just listen and comfort.  Talking to people always helps me.
Anxiety,f0s7fby,t3_d67nwf,1568900149.0,I personally have never ran into someone that attacks people is anxiety.  Probably because the only people that know are my friends.  Random people aren't gonna know that I do.
politics,f0otmah,t1_f0o9k8w,1568819963.0,"Pretty sure it was setup to protect smaller states.  Our votes in Kansas for example have way less of an impact than the entire echo chamber of California.  This makes it so we have at least a little voice.  Because what one state wants/needs should not be dictated by another.

I suggest you look into small government and help your own state rather than large government."
cursedcomments,f0luctz,t1_f0lg2hq,1568729770.0,To be fair 99% of these type of posts are fake af and their eyes are actually normal.
Anxiety,f0lu4lz,t3_d56opw,1568729612.0,"Avoid caffeine at all costs.  I switched to decaff and enjoy it.  Balance diet and exercise helps with mental and physical issues.  Also obligatory cbd oil.  Lol. Goodluck, man"
Anxiety,ezrsecn,t1_ezrln1g,1568078131.0,I'm 24 and still haven't passed the test due to anxiety.  Don't feel bad at all.  I've had an instructor put me down.  Sucks.
Anxiety,ezrs775,t3_d1y6d5,1568078044.0,"Hey, man.  Hopefully it subsided.  Good on you for recognizing the symptoms.  We're always here for ya!"
Anxiety,ezbo4s4,t1_ezbnm4k,1567823100.0,Thanks for the correction.
