I had a look at my original plan, and it seems that I've added 3 subplots, which I was writing at random intervals. it looked like ""plot point, plot point, sub plot A, sub plot B, plot point, plot point, sub plot B x 4, subplot A, sub plot B, plot point, plot point, plot point, sub plot B x2, plot point, plot point, sub plot B, plot point/conclusion. and it's likely the sub plots leaked into the plot point chapters.

seeing it now, I know I should probably take out sub plot A since it's not used much. sub plot A was tragic backstory or times when he met people he's scared of from the past. this was probably why my character felt inconsistent (since he appears to be a happy person), whereas sub plot B was friendly relationships with people the characters met while travelling (it could be considered the ""real"" story and it ties in with the main plot)

what worries me is that taking out plot plot A might prevent some of the plot points or the other sub plot from making sense. so does that mean it's actually part of the plot rather than a sub plot?"

* 5. (Pepi POV) They walk through the forest, talking to each other about holidays and family. Pepi gets anxious about the silence. They come across a pond, Renato inhales gas from a strange flower and begins to act loopy. 
* Action/ conflict
* There are some fairies who recognize Pepi, they tell him he met someone called Niklam and give him a shawm which he remembers losing but not spending time with the fairies or Niklam. 
* Consequence/resolution
* Pepi is cursed to dance/sing without stopping, but is saved by the presence of a large black horse which scares the fairies away, and they ride out of the forest.

I've struggled with it for as long as I can remember, my mum would substitute food for attention before I was 5, I got forced to lose weight at 9 years old, developed some restricting habits at 12.  I've been morbidly obese since I was 16. and when I was 18 it turned into full blown bulimia and was worsened by my anxiety (since it makes me nauseous).I'm now 22 and I've managed to reduce my purging, it used to be several times a week or day and it's now once a month or less, and I'm pretty sure it's because I now live by myself (I used to be in uni dorms and would hoard food in my room since I didn't want my roomates to see me). 

I still binge each day, I've read that ""Brain Over Binge"" that gets reccommended so often, I've had to deal with condescending comments about how ""easy"" CICO is and that I should be smart enough to use it and that I ""just :) need to stop :) eating crap :))"". for some reason people assume binge eating = eating sweets? I'm mostly eating healthy sandwiches tbh. the only time I eat less is when I'm so depressed I'm essentially comatose. 

binge eating is a deeply seated coping mechanism for me... it doesn't always feel like one of the ""self destructive"" symptoms because you can sort of do it without people noticing and it's less scary to others compared to doing drugs or drinking."

it's possible that having one triggers the others, e.g feeling exhausted from having anxiety then falling into depression which induces BPD. it could also be due to BPD mood swings with each mood carrying a set of symptoms..? you could have a closer look at what happened in each month to trigger each illness and next year you can prepare in advance"

(the woman who answered said it wasn't the weirdest thing she'd heard... yeah). I can do hours of research, my longest was 40 hours in one week. those oneline tests are a massive trigger for me and I usually end up spiralling.

I did find out that hypochondria is a mild form of psychosis, which makes sense because all of these obsessions just had no room for doubt in my mind. it takes the form of a very convincing logic and if anyone tries to convince me I'm not ill with whatever I get upset, so I just kinda have to wait it out each time.

sometimes people aren't prepared; it's a lot of stress to put on someone. and it can be draining to hear a person's negative thoughts because it'll be on their minds even after you part ways and they'll expect it every time they see you and could strt avoiding you.
