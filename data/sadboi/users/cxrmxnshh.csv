selfharm,fji7snt,t3_fdgi3d,1583362054.0,"I’ve had the pleasure of telling two therapists about my self harm. 

The first was a younger man who I saw for around a year. He was very cool and we had the same taste in music so I found it very easy to confide in him. I told him and he was very very chill about it. He was a school psychologist so I’m sure i wasn’t the first 15 year old girl he’s known who struggles with it. Even when I s/hmed at school, he’d be more interested in discussing what led up to it and my feelings more than anything else. 

The second was an older woman with notably less experience dealing with teenagers. She found out through a formal intake questionnaire I had to fill out, so it wasn’t really on my terms. She doesn’t treat it nearly as casually as my first therapist, she refers to it as “carving” which I find just a gross, dehumanizing term which gives it a weird culty connotation. She doesn’t tell my parents when I do self harm, but she has asked them to take my blades away once. 

I’ve never had an experience where they sound the alarms at the phrase “I cut myself”  unless you’re holding a blade as you say it. 

With that being said, its still a very misunderstood topic even amongst mental health professionals. I’d tread the topic lightly if you feel that they might twist it and think that it’s for suicidal reasons."
selfharm,fdqtken,t3_emt8rm,1578674581.0,"I get how lonely it can feel, without people in your life who know how to help or who care. It’s such an isolating feeling that can discourage you. I want you to know that you’re not alone! This subreddit is filled with people who feel this weight of being alone, not having a strong support system. You should let yourself cry it out, you’ll feel very purged of emotions after which might be nicer than feeling absolutely bottled up with nowhere to put that emotion other than in s/h. When you’ve finished your cry sesh, wash your face and put a cold compress over your eyes to reduce swelling. Try to practice self care as much as you can because crying is exhausting! This feeling will pass, just ride the wave as best as you can."
selfharm,fcuwbme,t3_ej18bv,1577989848.0,You’ve got this!! That’s a great goal to have
selfharm,fcuw9ma,t3_ej1bc8,1577989817.0,"I understand that feeling of attachment to it, it almost feels like a safety net for me and I found myself hoarding them “just in case” before I relapsed. Keep it somewhere hard to get to and somewhere no one will look (I kept mine in a heavyweight pen box, I used the blade to create a little slit that I could slip it into and no one would see, even if they took the pen out). Even if I don’t plan on using it, I would definitely recommend sterilizing it now, just so in the heat of the moment you don’t find yourself cutting with a dirty blade. Stay safe and in the mean time try to find other alternatives that work for you!"
selfharm,fcuvr4d,t3_ej1j8q,1577989531.0,"Always try to discuss it beforehand, “I just don’t want you to freak out when you see my thigh cause I have some s/h there” or something along those lines. Make sure they know that you’re not telling them as a cry for help, but to notify them for their comfort."
selfharm,f6q768q,t3_dslthz,1573072075.0,"don’t make it a big deal. She already knows all the dangers and how scarring doesn’t fade sometimes. Don’t repeat what she already knows. Obviously you still need to make sure that she’s safe, that may not be raiding her room for whatever she uses but if she’s in her room for a long period of time, get her to go watch a movie with you or help with cooking! Getting your mind off of sh with distractions is crucial for sh. If you want to have a conversation, make sure you’re casual but still concerned. Showing that you care, and aren’t mad is how I wish my parents approached it. Maybe have her speak with a psychologist if she’s open to it? I hope she falls in love with being alive someday. And good for you for reaching out, it can be really hard on parents and siblings."
selfharm,f6jv78f,t3_drnfu0,1572900715.0,If he’s a good friend he shouldn’t hate you. He needs to understand that you use sh as an outlet and simply talking about it doesn’t always fix things.
selfharm,f4q7k71,t3_dlhfub,1571749201.0,"The week of my 15th birthday. I remember I used the mini screwdriver from my glasses repair kit on a new pencil sharpener. It wasn’t even a sad day, it was just days and months of severe depression bottled up so the first second I was alone in my house I went for it. I remember i rested it out to see if it worked, lightly dragging the blade just below my knee. Immediately I thought “oh my god what am I doing it’s so obvious there” and that was the last time my thigh was scar free."
EatingDisorders,f4jc960,t3_dkr8uz,1571616887.0,"Take the batteries out! Or put it somewhere very hard to reach, that way you’ll have time to reflect on your actions and it’s outcome as you’re getting out the scale. In the mean time, my therapist always tells me to stand up straight and flex my stomach when I walk past a mirror because it makes you look smaller with the weight distribution around your torso, maybe this tool can help to assure yourself that you look okay? Proud of you for staying away from the scale for so long♥️."
selfharm,f4jbxap,t3_dkrz8b,1571616703.0,"Don’t feel bad! Opening up is so hard to do and you should feel proud that you managed telling her all that you did. You don’t owe it to anybody to tell the whole truth in the span of an afternoon. Confidentiality can be tricky, especially with school-provided therapy. Have you looked into the confidentiality agreements at your school? Like mine is as long as you aren’t going to off yourself or murder someone they can’t tell anyone."
selfharm,f4jbjk1,t3_dks5rk,1571616496.0,"I remember the first time I hit styro. I thought I was going to die once I saw the blood pool into the wound and it scared me so much that I felt sick every time I thought of sh and it ended up being my reason for quitting for nearly a year! It can be scary, I hope you have someone to vent to and if not this platform is great for support in the mean time."
selfharm,f3odtyj,t3_dhhpzc,1571015240.0,"Setting this sort of goal is definitely the beginning, “I’ll stop when I lose X amount of weight..” is already a disordered thought pattern. I said that and once you reach that goal weight, you won’t be happier. You’ll only be thinner and sicker. The idea that you have control over the disorder is so false. You lose control the second the think you’ve gained it. Please talk to someone you trust, whether it’s a teacher or a friend or anyone! You deserve to live a full life without this disease."
EatingDisorders,f3nm36x,t3_dhg665,1570999533.0,"I was in the same boat as you for a year! I had all the symptoms described in the DSM, but my doctor is very hesitant because of my age to diagnose anything. My mum was also super nosy and tried to get our GP to give her updates on mine and my sisters health, even when it’s ethically wrong. I was finally diagnosed this year with anorexia nervosa, and I’ve had no additional symptoms since my disordered eating first started. Bottom line is this, if you strongly believe that your symptoms and behaviours coincide with the symptoms described in the DSM, there’s a large chance that you could be struggling with anorexia. You don’t have to be diagnosed to recover, your feelings are valid and I hope that you try to fuel your body as much as you can♥️"
