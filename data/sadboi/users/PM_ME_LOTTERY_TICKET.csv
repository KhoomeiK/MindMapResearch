1. Don't hesitate to back out of a fight. Always have a plan for bailing out in every scenario.

2. Be mobile (ie. have a grab bag ready in your base or keep your vehicle stocked to last a few days if you have to bail out of your base)

3. Stay out of major towns and wait for the zeds to group for a while. 

4. Hand-to-hand or melee combat is dangerous. Using firearms could be even more dangerous, unless you keep in mind that zeds will come swarming very soon. I have found that vehicles is the most reliable, safe and effective weapon. Keep a vehicle in good shape and run/back them over in a slow speed."
