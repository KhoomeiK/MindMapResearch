Just remember to give yourself time to go trough the pain, but with every day the pain will go away. And right now when you’re going through that pain keep yourself rational When I went trough it I was seeing a therapist and that really helped me, it would be worth a shot to se someone or the reach out to someone so you can talk with somebody and vent.  I wish your best, and I have a discord server made for breakups, it’s on this thread in the front page but if you want I can link it. Bless you"

It’s not always going to be good but you just have to keep going till you hit a good run."

OCD,epw8n9y,t3_bw94qw,1559569221.0,"Hello, i'm sorry for what you are going trough and i know how it feels because i went trough exactly the same thing but I came out of it so you can do it too! What i want to tell you is I know it's hard but accepting the thoughts and not holding a grudge against yourself for them, will help you. I had those thoughts and i did not want to be homosexual (I have nothing against homosexual people and i'm not an homophobe) but accepting those thoughts and that I may be slightly attracted to men released a lot of pressure of me, and also that does not mean that I have to be an homosexual and that i won't be attracted to women! Look at the thoughts as running water, you can either put a bucket under it, fill it until it's full and then have have to throw the water out (I see this as crying or having a breakdown) or just let the water run not paying attention to it. It takes a while and I know it can be hard but you need to remember that people close to you, love you and accept you for who you are. I hope this helps, best wishes."
