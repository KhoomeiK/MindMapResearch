Adoption is a perfectly valid way to grow your family-- it's not necessarily for everyone and that's okay--but adopting a child does not diminish in any way shape or form the love of a parent to a child and shame on anyone who thinks it somehow diminishes the family unit.

I get that you're probably just venting about a lot of frustration you have pent up about how people talk. I wasn't adopted, so I don't have your perspective and would never claim to, but I have to imagine that when you hear people talk about adoption as being this distasteful thing, it makes you feel attacked and as if somehow your life circumstances are ""less than"". I'm glad you're taking some time to vent your feelings, and I hope you know that's not true--that how you came by a family is just as valid and loving as how I did."
