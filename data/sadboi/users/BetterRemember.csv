I experienced a computer virus in the 2000's that came with porn pop-ups and I was exposed to violent porn when I was around 7 years old, yeah.. my mom gave me my own computer to play around with when I was 7. I tried to download music illegally because I was a dumb kid and I was met with images of women in pigtails being slapped and spit on, I've been anti-porn ever since then.

One video was of a very small woman playing a child and wearing a shirt I actually had in my closet, they often dress porn-stars in actual children's clothing. I remember running into my room and tearing it up after and wondering how many items in my closet had been shown in porn.

So yes, this is about you! This is about children just as much as it is about women. I've seen men pretending to be teenage boys too, and with that industry they might have actually been underage, we have no way of knowing. By all means, keep up with research and take a peak at activism that other older people are doing but use most of your time to be a kid! **I just wouldn't interact directly with pro-porn people until you are much older because a lot of them are pedophiles and they are dangerous.**"

It makes no sense, especially because no matter how heartless men pretend to be, hatred still eats away at a person. Misogyny is a net-negative yet most men are still obsessed with it. It feels so fucking hopeless. There is nothing you can do to convince someone that you are a person, that you experience reality just like they do, that you don't deserve t suffer. Especially when they have been taught to see you as subhuman and somehow sinful/evil just for breathing ever since they could talk. I've heard this from several men in my life, it's so painful to face reality, they are disgusted with their own gender. 

My boyfriend was at a sleepover when he was 13 and his friends played some porn, just the first video off the home page, and the woman was being spat on and hit and degraded and choked. He had a panic attack and ran to the washroom and all but one of the other boys mocked him. The one didn't mock him started crying, and is the only one he's still friends with. They couldn't believe that this was supposed to be normal and even enjoyable to watch. They couldn't believe how normalized hatred of women was. 

I think I feel similarly to you when it comes to being white. I'm horrified at the atrocities that have been committed in the name of ""the white race"". I am disgusted with the actions of many of my ancestors and even the shit my family members say sometimes. I've freaked out and vomited learning about residential schools. My ancestors created such an ugly legacy and I unknowingly benefitted from the ""white privilege"" they created for years of my life. It's horrifying to realize that. The only thing you can really do to cope is to commit to standing up against it and being a good ally. What I've realized is that I can use my white privilege to amplify indigenous people's voices because their oppressors won't listen to them but they might listen to me. 

It's the same with being male. Men don't want to listen to a woman speaking out against rape-culture they just dismiss her as ""hysterical"" or accuse her of false rape accusations or scream ""WHAT ABOUT MALE RAPE VICTIMS???"" But if another man points out the issues that created rape culture other men are more willing to listen, if only for a second. I *still* see men quoting Kurt Cobain on feminist issues.

I took a feminist philosophy course last semester and while it was a bit lib-femy the professor really didn't hold back when it came to discussing the hellish reality we live in. We read a paper by Sara Ahmed called ""Becoming a Feminist: Feminism as sensational."" which outlined how once you learn about how much misogyny there is you end up losing the ability to ignore it, it's like a physical sense. You can't just stop having a sense of smell just because everything reeks, you can't stop seeing your own dehumanization once you notice it. 

  One of the men in the class noted that he can't slip into denial about sexism as easily as he used to, that it's like a physical pain now when he witnesses an act of misogynist hatred or reads about male violence against women or even watches a toy commercial that framed little girls as passive. The switch has been flipped and it's stuck like that, you can't go back, and it's exhausting. The trade-off is that you actually begin to see the gigantic disgusting thing you are up against.

But then they want to think that everything about women is passive, it would go against their beliefs to actually acknowledge that a vagina is basically all muscle. They have this fucked up fetish for believing that everything about women's biology is designed to support the patriarchy and to serve men in some way.

AskPinkPillers,fp3r303,t1_fp3ppik,1588284260.0,"Suffragettes had to demand the vote. Slaves had to demand freedom. The stonewall riots ended in more rights for LGBTQ people. Workers protesting and rioting gave us unions and the 8 hour workday. Civil rights activists protested loudly. Protesting ended residential schools in Canada because in what world would people not be angry that their children were being stolen and abused by Catholic priests? 

I honestly don't know what kind of reality you are living in but you can't twist the course of human history to your liking. Nobody achieved freedom and justice by asking nicely. Without those people you wouldn't remember fondly ""screaming"" you and I would both be living like slaves today.

Why do pedos and incels even need to be at the library so much when they can't even read an entire book? I guess they need a change of scenery from mommy's basement and there are no little girls to harass in person down there."

AskPinkPillers,fp3a0r9,t1_fp1bsfv,1588275690.0,"Bottom line, if you wanted military worship here you were never going to get it. It's illogical to get angry when people don't emphatically agree with you. The military banks on people from lower socioeconomic status feeling like the military is their best option, and then they are sent to kill and die.

 It's a human meat grinder, not some glorious honour that rich politicians and their corporate pals bestowed upon you. There's a reason that high schools in poorer areas get far more military recruitment events. They were always at my school because it was an overcrowded school known for high rates of poverty, we were the prime targets. 

I went to university but a lot of the kids I knew either dropped out or got sucked into the military. If you are born poor and you are not lucky enough to find a way into post secondary you are seen as potentially expendable."

I don't walk around pretending that forms of racist oppression are not real just because I could be personally offended by someone pointing them out. I don't try to manipulate people of colour into being silent about their oppression except for in very specific pre-approved scenarios. So I don't understand why so many men do that when it comes to misogyny. If you only speak when members of the oppressor class tell you that you can speak you'll never be able to say a damn thing."

There is so much more porn now that's just downright hateful and degrading, it's just a woman getting beaten but there are men with erections so it's somehow okay?? 

Most people have to be gradually conditioned to enjoy that kind of sadistic/ depraved bullshit otherwise it's a shock. On a lot of porn sets, they provide hard drugs because the porn stars need to be numb to be able to pretend to enjoy what basically ends up being torture. Most female porn stars only last an average of 3 months in the industry because they often end up with so many injuries. Most of it is just for shock value so people will click out of morbid curiosity and the company will make more money, it's not even about what the largest amount of people would enjoy watching anymore. 

Then, of course, an incel is braindead and their whole worldview is based around pornography and hentai.
