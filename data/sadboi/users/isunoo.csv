Agoraphobia,fr3jbqn,t1_fr0iv08,1589858646.0,"Try not to glorify the agoraphobia or thinking of it in the slightest of romantic way. Agoraphobia and social anxiety are illnesses. You might be used to it like I was, but it is an illness. I only fully realized that while I was inside the hospital. The realization sux. The fact I have to face the reality of life and my many problems sux. But at least I am going through life now. As miserable and sick as i still am, I would do anything to not be back in isolation ever again. Fk that."
Agoraphobia,fqzy073,t1_fqzwt1r,1589778273.0,"Read my other reply on hospitalization and stuff. I think you shouldn't be putting these off like this. The covid 19 will crush the mental health system in every country. If you wait for the virus to blow pass, then there will be a huge surge in people seeking help. 

I personally wouldn't put it off because of covid 19. Try a text line first. I'm sure there is one in Australia. As far as I know, Australia's health care system is way better than America's complicated and divisive healthcare system. So if I can access help here in america as poor as I am, you can definitely do it in Australia. You can start by texting a helpline and tell them you need help. You need to be seen by professionals. Hopefully this will lead you to different programs like peer support groups and pros program that helped me."
Agoraphobia,fqzw5vo,t1_fqsohvc,1589776880.0,"Wow yea. You are in the exact same situation I was in. I wanted to get help but was in many ways afraid of asking, and self doubt in a million ways.

With the hospital, I know how you feel. I felt like I wasnt the real type of sick for hospitals. That people there don't care about me. Or that I needed a very specific treatment that is hard to find. The thing is, most mental health treatment at most hospitals are definitely not designed to treat anyone properly. It is merely a place to subdue the crazy and violent types, and also keep the suicidal from killing themselves. So if you're looking for the right type of hospital, you most likely won't find it. The best you can do is to use what is available, and try to come out as better as you can. 

The hospital staffs or doctors will never understand you. If you think they won't take you in, then just say you're suicidal. I've been hospitalized 3 times so far, and I have seen all types of people in there. Some are really sick, some just have a bit of OCD and wanted to get help. IMO, agoraphobia is more destructive to health than OCD, so if they dont take you seriously, just say you're suicidal then they can't refuse. The thing is to suppress your self doubt and just do it.

The hospitalization for me was awful like I said. But I knew what I was doing and what I wanted. I used that experience to force myself out of my own prison and it worked. The medication was awful for me, but you can always refuse it. They can't force it on you if you voluntarily admitted yourself to the hospital and is cooperating. 

Right now, you can start by contacting a helpline to get yourself familiar with the process. Use the text line to avoid speaking on the phone. I was scared and insecure to call strangers just like you. I texted them and got some info and familiarized myself with everything. Then I took the courage and just went to the hospital. 

You can ask me any questions, and I'll help you out."
Agoraphobia,fqzujgd,t1_fqsojst,1589775731.0,"Yes, it was a lot of impulse that made me took that step, but it also took months of wanting to do it. I wanted to get help and kept thinking about it for months before I finally had enough. So, impulse was the spark, and the planning was the fuse. Does that make sense to you?

Help yourself out here by thinking about getting help. Get in to that mindset. You don't have to be hospitalized, it could be expensive depending on your health insurance, but think about getting help. Maybe speak to a help line that can help you link up to help. I texted a helpline and asked them for guidance while remaining anonymous to get an idea and weight my options. It's an awful thing to break out of, but building that fuse in your mind is important."
Agoraphobia,fqppdap,t3_gk64ug,1589551438.0,"Back in 2017, I didnt leave my apartment for 7 months straight. I eventually broke out of it by gathering enough courage and took a taxi to an ER and told them I needed help. They hospitalized me and put me on meds. The hospitalization and meds were awful for me, but the whole experience did broke me out of the isolation. I even found a job afterwards, but went downhill again afterwards. I am 24 now and still having a lot of problems with agoraphobia, depression, anxiety, and complex health problems, but I am a lot more functional than before. I can leave my apartment when I have to.

Did you get your hormones checked? I mean like the actual numbers, and not just take the word from doctors who say you're okay. My testosterone levels were in the 200s when I was your age, and my doctor at the time ignored it. I wasnt knowledgeable about hormones back then, but now looking back 200 was extremely low for an late teenager.  That could very well be a big contributor to the fatigue, the joint pains, and in my case the poor sleep, no existent libido, poor immunity, being underweight, poor development, and brain fog.

At this point, I do accept that psychology has a big part to play in one's poor health. However, treating it exclusively as a mental problem isn't going to solve anything. I've done that and my symptoms never really improved. Sure my anxiety decreased, and my sleeps were better while medicated under anti depressants, but it also gave me new problems.

Despite prolonged period of loneliness, mental illness, and health problems, i still care about people. I still try to do my best in life. Even when i felt like the whole world is against me, i can still rationalize and pull myself back up relatively quickly. My life is so miserable that i think most normies would have given up the moment they step into my shoes. If i kill myself, it's not because i hate this world or i hate people, it's because i have lost the battle against the monster. That is my pride."

I did work a minimum paying retail job last year, and I have to be honest, it helped a lot. The job gave me a structure, and something to wake up for. The job exhausted me so I sleep better. The money was also very freeing, and I was getting slightly better in every way. Unfortunately, even after getting better I was still a mess, and was really lonely, so I quit."

SuicideWatch,eyyacgq,t3_ctq66f,1567577440.0,"I am experiencing something very very similar to what you're going through. I have been suffering from chronic problems including the chronic neck and joint pain, but also many others. These health problems have derailed my life since junior year of high school. I am 23 now and live at home with complete socially isolation. I held jobs before, but always ended up quitting because the loneliness and the toil were too much to bare on top of my health. 

I have been trying to get better, but the doctors I have seen cant help. I guess they think I am making up the illnesses. My hormones are out of whack, and the endocrinologist tells me he can't help because it isnt life threatening. My joint and neck hurts, and doctor only reccomend me to excercise, which made my neck and shoulder pain even worse eventually. Oh, and I also can't burp which means gas builds up and I feel awful and dizzy after meals. Great right? That's not all, I also have lost my sexual health since 15 and it's never came back. I have so many reason to die, but being a coward is also one of my problems...

I also have your sleep problem too. Always wake up feeling awful and like if my body was never asleep. That could be the anxiety though, because when I was on SSRIs, sleep was great improved. However now it's back since I am not taking any meds."
