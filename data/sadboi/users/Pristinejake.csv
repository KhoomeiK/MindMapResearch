AskReddit,foa06up,t3_g69kfu,1587636259.0,"I think I’ve seen worse but I always think about this. In middle school There was a tree next to the front office and one day a humming bird made a nest and there was a little baby humming bird inside. Kid’s would gather around to see the humming bird. One day this kid had this irritating little smirk on his face while all the kids were looking at the baby. he pulls off his backpack and swipes down the nest killing the baby. A teacher walked up and asked where the humming bird was and a kid said one of the kids knocked it down. And she said something like what! Really!! Who?? jeeze these kids and sounded pretty mad and marched into the office. I think she grabbed him by the arm and the kid was giggling and smiling. 

I never forgot that kids face. He was smiling like he did something funny. I think there was worse things that happened but I was new to the town and I just remember thinking this place was fucked up and I didn’t want to be there."

Had a bit of a back and forth with someone who claimed Christ and scoffed and mocked me because I said Jesus was an immigrant. He told me I was lying. I showed him where king Harid ordered all the new born boys to be killed so Mary and Joseph fled their country to protect Jesus as a baby making Jesus an immigrant. After standing his ground and claiming Christ while obviously not knowing the Bible I kept showing him scripture refuting his claims and he eventually stopped replying.

Jesus’s words are the “sword of the Spirit”. People try to fight you but his words eventually put an end to any debates. Because Jesus is good and people want to use his name to justify their own corruption."

SandersForPresident,fl3ftya,t1_fl3flx4,1584781943.0,"Lol totally respect your point. Yeah Christianity has been twisted into something that isn’t Christianity and I understand you’re anger towards it. Even Jesus hated how people twisted it in his time. If you read his words I think you’d find that he was angry about the same things as you. Like tithe. Jesus got upset with people who were using God to take their money. Jesus flipped tables over and got very upset. The book is really really good. Cuz when you read it, you realize he’s mad at all the same things you’re mad about and he wants to forgive everyone for it."
SandersForPresident,fl3fajs,t1_fl3dv12,1584781224.0,"Oh yeah, I think most people were brought up really against their will. Haha sorry it was shown to you in a negative light. A lot of parents are scared and know the Bible has helped them out of some very hard times. Like myself there are decisions in my life that had disastrous outcomes but if I would’ve listen to my convictions people wouldn’t have gotten hurt, relationships would’ve had better outcomes. I’ve done things out of selfishness that I look back on and think I didn’t really need to do that or say hurtful things. Some people just have good convictions built into them. Others don’t have them and turn to good words to help them have those convictions they lack. Some people need to be reminded. And some people take it too far and try to force their kids to believe in somthing that has helped them but they take it too far. They forget to be loving and patient. what kid wants to be bullied into believing in anything? 

As for me why I’m such a believer is because if you have parents that claim Christ and they’re talking down to you or using too much force. Pretty much anyone who is just not acting right there’s somthing pretty cool about Jesus. When you read his words you are suddenly armed. They call Jesus’s words the Sword of the spirit. Jesus says “do not despise these little children” imagine saying that to an adult who despises you for not believing in Jesus. Jesus has a word that can disarm the wrong in others and in myself. 

Jesus pretty much attacks hatred, evil and anger but when we are thrown into this world we don’t know his words. Others try to tell us what Jesus says. I’ve spent a lot of my life just reading the words of Jesus and it has transformed my family because they used to be domineering and aggressive In their faith but as I learned Jesus’s words I was armed and able to fight back. That’s why he came, to fight religious hypocrisy. To bring people back to the Loving God. People who raised me suddenly knew that they couldn’t tell me anything about Jesus. I know Jesus. And Jesus is loving and kind. He can be aggressive but only when people are not being loving and kind. Lol cus Jesus stands up for what is right! Even if I die and I turn out to be wrong. Knowing his words has taught me that most people are wrong in their claims of being a Christian. I myself included are constantly put in check by his words and in following his words I realize that his words are alive. Everything I do is put in check. I forget a ton of things, I forget everything, but right before I make a decision that is wrong now I immediately become convicted by his words. So one day I just realized that other people words I forget. His words prompt me constitnanty to the point to where I feel like he’s really there! Lol so for me I understand you. But for the past 26 years of seeking Jesus I’ve seen his words transform me and others. If you wanna battle anyone of any faith, go to the source material. For me I battled family and came out knowing Jesus was real for me and they turned out to learn who Jesus really was and are a lot kinder. Like then bible says “iron sharpens iron” there a lot of Good in the Bible. A lot of weird too lol but a lot of good. But I’m sorry religion had a negative effect on your life. It’s always sad to hear when parents or teachers take it too far and miss what Jesus is all about."

Plus a lot of people come here just to be homeless cuz of the foot traffic and weather. Also California is doing a lot for the homeless situation. Constantly see food pantry’s and people cooking for the poor. In some areas they have mass amounts of portable trailers brought out for them. I was just talking to a friend about when the Levi broke in New Orleans and the state gave $6000 pay people to relocate and a lot of them used the money to come over to California just to be homeless. Or start over. You move to a new place with no job priorly secured it’s going to make it harder to survive anywhere. Also homelessness happens cuz a lot of people have no one to fall back on when in hard times just like any other state. No different here. There’s just a ton more people.

I feel like when anyone leaves someone’s life, weather it’s going separate ways or on to the next life, I truly feel like it’s because their purpose was fulfilled. That all they had to offer the world was completed. And That drive and push to live life harder is a gift from them to you. 

I heard someone put it like that in some way that when a person leaves it was because they fulfilled what they were set on earth to do. I have to believe that. Everything that was meant to be said and done by them is used by those who needed it to move forward in life. And it’s all in the right time.
