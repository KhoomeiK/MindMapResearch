The left the lens brings more light in and on the right the lens tightens to bring less light. This creates the depth of field change. Here‚Äôs a video about aperture:

AskReddit,fe5rmqc,t3_envtbc,1578873601.0,"My dad got me this giant oversized Tigger shirt (from Winnie the Pooh) when I was a kid. Used to love wearing his shirts as a kid because they smelt like him and he had to work a lot. But obviously he needed his shirts not to be worn by a messy kid, so he put some of his cologne on it and gave it to me for Christmas. Almost 20 years later I still wear it. Tigger is basically unrecognizable but no other night shirt gives me the same happiness."

BPD,fdh1j38,t3_elctke,1578413357.0,"Hey! Totally relate to this. Therapist and Psychiatrist pointed to Bipolar. My family does have a few members with a history, which made the diagnosis all that much easier. But it felt like there were certain aspects I had to make fit in my own mind if that makes sense. For example, I would have mood swings and they could range from depression to inspiration or trying hard on something - but never felt like mania in the way it was described. Wasn‚Äôt until I was around someone who had bipolar and was in a manic episode to realize there was a difference. It was exactly like what I had read, it was intense for her, and I felt like a fraud to see her struggle and be identified with the exact same thing. On the good side, it lead to questioning and speaking out to my Psychiatrist about the mixed feelings and concerns on how my experiences related to the bipolar experiences. Low and behold, the term BPD was introduced. Never had that same ‚Äúforcing the description‚Äù to match my experiences vibe since. Everyone who had it and all the information read just felt amazingly relatable without any stretch."
BPD,fdgs4p5,t3_el6lnl,1578406913.0," ü§£ Totally with you mate. I‚Äôll raise you even one step further to add an extra little flair of bizarre. I genuinely, when looking at my own profile, look at my eyes and ask myself if they look honest. Or if my body language or facial expressions look good intentioned and genuine. But I‚Äôve never gone through a newsfeed and ever thought ‚Äúgosh... those are some honest looking eyes..‚Äù or ‚Äúwhew, look at that good intentioned body posture!‚Äù"

BorderlinePDisorder,fdc8f8i,t3_ekkypz,1578269128.0,"My mother attempted suicide when I was 13, then moved half way across the country for over a decade without fighting to come back. Just remembering thinking ‚ÄòWas I not worth living for?‚Äô ‚ÄòWas I not worth fighting to come back to?‚Äô That seems to stem a lot of the abandonment fears that correlate with BPD for me.  But as you said, not everyone is the same. Getting to know yourself and the environments that you grew up in is important. But sometimes focusing on each day and how you want to improve and seeing what holds you back can be even more telling than trying to turn over every rock of your past."

suggestmeabook,ey9icu9,t3_cwb1xw,1566944016.0,"Sorry to hear about your partner struggling.Been dealing with the same for half a year. Finally booked and went to a psychiatrist last week. I asked the same thing to them, are there any books I can read in conjunction with future appointments to help myself? She told me one of the most important things to learn that most of her patients who come in usually benefit immensely from is mindfulness. The book I am reading now is: ‚ÄúMindfulness‚Äù by Mark Williams. Not saying mindfulness cures people like a pill, but in the week since that appointment and reading this book I do think it makes me feel more in control and somewhat optimistic that things will ease up mentally if I put work and routine into practicing mindfulness. Guessing there are a million other books on this people with more than one week experience could recommend, but a start is a start!"
