These aren't problematic in the way we were talking about before, but they are there 

The main thing is the technological exclusivity Ryder practices. He managed to design and build a full functional ai dog robot that can pilot a plane, a bus, and a submarine, cars (and a God damn helicopter) and bionic arms that can be controlled by dogs, an atv that can turn into a hovercraft at the touch of a button, and countless other gadgets and gizmos that could make life for everyone better and easier, but keeps it all to himself and his crew.

TumblrInAction,fjdaqf2,t1_fjctmjd,1583249421.0,"Basically they're saying that paw patrol is classist because of the way they portray one of the dogs. The ""Garbage man dog"" is hydrophobic and therefore avoids baths, and is the only dog on the show who is obviously a mix breed. Some people read this as ""the garbage dog is a dirty mutt and all the others are clean and pure"", while many many more of us see it as ""your background means nothing as long as you contribute to the betterment of the group"". This classist nonsense is ridiculous on its face because all the other pups in the core group have blue collar jobs as well (fireman, cop, construction worker, coast guard, pilot).

 I've been force fed every episode of paw patrol that's on Netflix at least twice, and there are quite a few problematic aspects of the show, but suggesting it has classist propaganda aimed at kids is just being ignorant. At the end of the day Rocky is the nicest one in the group, he is regularly willing to face his fears to help someone in need, and he's a hard core environmentalist/genius inventor who makes gadgets and machines out of literal garbage, he just suffers from hydrophobia, so he avoids baths when he can help it. IF (big if) there is classist propaganda in the Paw Patrol, it's in favor of the lower class.
