oh, and he also totally just wants hot girls to dm him lmao. if he didn’t, he could text krystal herself or talk to his friends & family who have all gone through heartbreak. he could even talk to other bn members who have gone through public heartbreaks! but he doesn’t need to air his dirty laundry for his followers to attack his ex. he just wants the hot girls in those dms. call it like i see it.
