Anxiety,fqcqfdg,t3_ghiqy2,1589265582.0,"Always. It’s exhausting. 

And every time I try to tell myself “you’re fine, you’re overthinking this,” a different voice in my brain brings me back to the select experiences in the past where I HAD done or said something wrong. At that point I don’t know which voice to believe, which only fuels more anxiety.

Like I said: exhausting, lol."

Impeach_Trump,fnt8m59,t1_fnt22qy,1587236722.0,"It is insane.

When I say “not totally absurd,” it’s relative to other decisions made by Trump. On its own, it’s batshit crazy. My point is: temporarily freezing WHO funding is not as absurd as Trump calling for “liberation” and defiance of public health orders. 

My stance would be different if WHO was entirely funded by the US, but it’s not, and other countries have already made sizeable contributions. 

The funding freeze will likely encourage additional donations from independent sources (I think Bill Gates is meant to donate $150 million? I could be wrong,) and the dire long-term consequences (not covid related) can (hopefully) be avoided if the US votes the shithead out of office come 2021. But in the short term, he’s doing so much more harm, and my honest worry is that more attention will be paid to this and its potential long term impacts, and not to the very present crisis of his corrupt leadership.    

I’m genuinely not trying to minimize how bad this is. But in the short term, Trump will do more damage all on his own. He’s done this finger pointing schtick before and it’s dangerous. That’s just my take."

AmItheAsshole,fj5zok7,t3_fbjec8,1583049689.0,"Going to chime in super late here, but wanted to give my two cents: one of my dad’s favourite things to say (to me, to family, to friends) is what an ugly baby I was, how horrified he was when he met me, how he joked to my mom that they should replace me for another baby, etc. 

His heart is golden and he loves me immensely, but he has trouble expressing himself when he is emotional, so he turns to humour. Sometimes (often, actually) it makes for untimely jokes.

This all has come to an abrupt stop now that my doctor found blood vessels growing in my cornea (that would eventually obstruct my vision if I were to continue sleeping in my contacts/forgetting to remove them.)

The process of putting them in/taking them out is simple and easy if done right. If you don't wash your hands prior to putting them on, you risk putting in dirty contacts which hurt like absolute hell. If you leave them in too long, they end up sticking to your eye and you have to then carefully pull them off which feels pretty awful too (so instead of them sliding off easily, it's like they're glued to your eye.)

AskWomen,eszkk6o,t3_c9ktv3,1562363589.0,"One of my favourite rom coms of all time is Little Black Book, solely for its portrayal of a real situation that I think many people experience. 

In the movie, two people are in a seemingly happy relationship. On the surface, they don’t really have many problems. Maybe a few small things here and there, but they’re otherwise content. Brittany Murphy’s character eventually begins to snoop - not necessarily out of suspicion, but sheer curiosity, to eventually realize that her boyfriend will never really love her the way he loves someone else. It’s as simple as that, and it’s incredibly heartbreaking. You can do everything right, but you can’t force love. And sometimes people spend years carrying out relationships, being perfectly content, while quietly, unconsciously suppressing their feelings for someone else. 

10/10 storytelling, I thought. The Carly Simon-filled soundtrack is also a delightful bonus."
