virgin,flrmmh9,t1_flq6nhc,1585423346.0,That’s true. It depends on the escort though. Sometimes they’ll invite you to their skyrise apartment (;

dating_advice,fcc2an2,t1_fcc0o9o,1577593610.0,Yeah they basically give me that when I ask them questions and try to relate with them and so and so and give me a dry response. It would seem that they probably do suck at responding or aren’t interested as you said. So You’re right I shouldn’t waste my time. Thank you for replying to my post and having this discussion with me!
dating_advice,fcbzjkm,t1_fcbz0hf,1577592721.0,"Almost.

They respond but it’s dry or short “like hahaha or oh nice”. I heart it and don’t respond and then they try to talk to me again later and I respond and then I receive another dry response. At this point I just heart and lead myself out.

(And yes insta DMs)."
