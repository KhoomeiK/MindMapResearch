Telling rape victims to forgive perpetuates rape culture. Listen to survivors, NEVER tell them what to do, and NEVER tell them to forgive. Forgiveness is an overrated trope that does not serve survivors, please educate yourself:

I realized it as I had been raped while compiling my ENTIRE trauma history for my May 15th, 2020 psychiatrist evaluation. Yeah, I had a 2 hour psych eval, and then cast this hex on the same night. The rape happened when I was 22. When I was 18, my first sexual experience was akin to rape, I had a freeze response, and dissociated. Because of that experience I developed PTSD. But I wasn't talking about it to anyone, and I didn't start therapy until I was 21. When I was raped I wasn't going to therapy at the time, I was living in a state of repression, so that when it happened, I didn't tell anyone and I just went to sleep and made it disappear from my consciousness. I realized that I had been raped in April 2020, four years after it happened, because my trauma response masked the event from my conscious memory. When I realized it, I begun having flashbacks, I'm working through it in EMDR, I'm not having flashbacks anymore."

""Fear collapses the imagination. When you feel attuned to power struggles today, stay present. You owe it to yourself to breathe and go inward. Work on creating a nurturing home inside yourself, independent of external people and forces. It can be hard to submit when you're jealous and judgmental. There's nothing inherently wrong with locking your heart away as if it were a safe, it doesn't necessarily serve your purpose right now. Be open to the presence of all your past selves, otherwise they'll turn up unannounced and take you by surprise. The general theme of your life during this period is to get free by transforming your surroundings. A ravenous appetite for yourself is no small thing."""

I have cPTSD, but I have hope too. I have done EMDR for a year now, and it has taken some of my most painful life experiences away from me. The way EMDR works, is you visualize the traumatizing experience, and the therapist moves her finger back and forth from left to right, your eyes follow her fingers as you reprocess the memory. This eyelid movement activates both hemispheres of the brain and you rewire your neural passageways to lessen and dampen the event, effectively undoing the severity of the trauma. Before you begin the eyelid movement you identify the negative self belief at the core of the memory. Then you identify the positive self belief you would rather feel. Once you identify the negative and positive self belief, you begin the eyelid movement. You repeat this process and you take the negative self belief (for me about this memory of being raped my negative self belief was that I am dirty) and replace it with the positive self belief (It's not my fault. It's over, I'm safe now). I have so much hope for you my dear friend, I have so much love for you, may your heart bloom, thank you for your blessing last night, I felt it, I am blessed.

Thank you for letting me know about the witchcraft of northern Africa, esp. in regard to Morocco, and Egypt...I will seek out that witchcraft. I know r/catWithAGrudge is responding to r/oldbetch but I wanted to talk about this...and I appreciate you bringing it up."
witchcraft,fqtlmrd,t1_fqrkl14,1589641396.0,"Ok so, last night I did the rapist hex from the link, I completed it just in time, and lit the candle at 11:11, for about an hour and half I chanted ""justice is here, justice is served"" and I channeled the energy of the flame and the witches who fucked with this post. After I did the hex, I showered w/lavender/moon water, and went to sleep, I lit sage this morning and today I'm going to clean my house and then tonight I am going to complete ""my"" hex...by collecting graveyard dirt....sprinkling it into my hex jar, and then rage screaming/cursing him w/my selenite dagger in the woods beyond my Ma Tree.

My problem is that my hex jar that I made 2 weeks ago, has cigarette butts (not biodegradable) and my phlegm (personal concern). I thought about opening the jar, fishing our the butts, and plastic, and then disposing of it in a hole that I dig in the cemetery. But I'm feeling conflicted cause I don't really want to open the jar. I thought disposing of the hex jar in a landfill was the way to go (best compromise for eco consciousness and the hex itself).

So then there is the jar I hexed last night from the atheist rapist hex link...and I thought about walking to the graveyard tonight, doing the cemetery ritual (collecting my dirt/offering flowers/washing my hands w/water/walking out a different way than I walked in) and timing it so that I dump out the jar with toilet water and the dead moth (that I found, thank you moth) into the cemetery...but again I'm not sure about this because I don't really want to ""release him."" I feel like the landfill is the way to go for this jar too.
