depression,fjwly0a,t1_fjpyun2,1583640880.0,"Recently I opened up to my parents abouthow I feel. About how most of the time, things on the surface feel okay, but how I mostly just am hiding how much I feel like I am pathetic and not worth talking to. I explained to my Dad how I sometimes just drive my car to certain spots and just sit on the road and stare off into space for hours on end. The days that I just sit in my room too miserable to leave my room, too depressed to play videogames or watch TV, and too anxious to sit in a room alone with myself for more than 2 minutes. Yet if I try and force myself out of my apartment, I hate every minute of it and just want to go back to my room with every fiber of my being.

I explained how I feel so awful trying to talk to girls and how I feel like no girl will ever want to be with me, because I cant even sit in a room alone with me because I constantly over-think everyting and spiral out of control. I told them how I genuinely hate myself because I feel like a failure and a loser and someone who just never belongs. 

My Dad just looked at me and said ""I don't understand how that feels. That is not something I understand. If I feel somethingi just 'fix it.'""

It makes me feel so alone and miserable. That was 2 months ago. I started feeling better for a little bit, but  the whole time I knew my next wave was just aroumd the corner. I live month to month fearing the next wave of self-hating depression and anxiety inducing loneliness. 

I just want to be better. I want to be okay. I want to be told its not too late to make myself into a better person and believe it."

How did you manage even these small crystals?

I think my problem is that the pot i was using to make them was too wide and caused the bismuth to cool from the bottom up instead of the top down, but i am not sure."
