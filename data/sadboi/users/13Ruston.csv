I think by default attacks are inverted, that can be unchecked too. You can also angle attacks with movement, apparently, but I haven't tried it. Alternatively, I just unbound default attacks, bound all right attacks to mouse buttons and I switch the attack direction with 'alt'.

There are lots of options to customize controls, but either way, they take time getting used to, because the skill ceiling is incredibly high."
