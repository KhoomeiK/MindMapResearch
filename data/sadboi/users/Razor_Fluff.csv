EliteDangerous,fl7x91a,t1_fl7wuq4,1584911328.0,I'm not sure yet. Today i flew over to Maia system and took a break since I was playing for like 10 hours. But I'm gonna go further. Maybe just to fly arround and explore but may as well take some missions. But im heading towards the outer rim I think.

I'm kinda half way to do something like this. 
I got myself a little box where I put cash every week. Everything I managed to save. Then there is a paper where I keep track on my savings like writing down ammounds I put in or out. But making some decisions and sticking to them may improve my system even more. Thanks!"

factorio,fcxm1la,t3_ejgeah,1578066184.0,"Factorio is a preety complete game for me if it makes any sense. Like paid DLC's are maybe the thing. But we got a few games factorio-like lastly. And TBH it would be hard to make like Factorio 2. Also what could be possibly added in those DLC's? I saw an idea of improved combat mechanics etc but it could be just a big update, IDK. I know it may sound like I'm stingy but if there is anything really worth it, like a big deal addition to the game I'm willing to give Factorio devs my money ^^"

mentalillness,fcx2t3i,t3_ejdq9e,1578048723.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. When i have this type of episodes i tend to stay at home at my room too and just doing nothing but watching movies, listening to music and playing video games (also living with a flatmate). But this sounds much more complex. So IDK what to think. I mean friends support helped me a lot so don't give up on it. That's for sure. Just try talking to them maybe, anything. But I don't know if there is a way other than just letting them get over with it. But that's just my point of view. In my opinion you should keep on trying to i tract with them and try to convince them to at least take a shower; basic self care if u know what I mean. Hopefully they will feel better soon. I'm sorry I can't really help you :("
