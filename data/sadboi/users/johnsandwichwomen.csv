therapy definitely has its benefits and i think you should give it a shot when ready."

I got slapped on the regular too i was always very careful to not say anything contradicting my mom when she was angry as she would usually slap me for that. Soap in the mouth is another terrible one, putting chemicals into your child's body just to have them gag on it for hours later. Fuck you mom and fuck you dad for being a enabler... i still flinch whenever someone goes to hit or spank me playfully. This is not how i will raise my kid. Timeout yes, hands on your child, no."

Listen girl you are a easy 9 but you need to look inside more often for your reassurance rather then other sources ie compliments, likes, matches on dating sites and followers. In today's day and age (coming from a fellow attractive person, 20m) we are constantly flooded with what's mentioned above that it warps our self view. keep your head up and try meditating or write in a journal."
