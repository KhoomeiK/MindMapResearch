Your daughter has opened the door to you to try and heal your relationship, but she’s far to hurt and angry to listen to your reasons, she just needs to know you are sorry

If you want to have a relationship with your daughter, you need to support her process.  She needs to lash out and blame you, she’s not ready to hear your reasons yet.

Whilst therapy is strictly confidential, I’d maybe ask your daughter for permission to have separate sessions for you with same therapist?  You’ve been through hell too OP so take the guidance and advice especially if the together sessions are daughter unleashing and blaming everything on you 

I suffer with my mental health, so whilst not an eating disorder I have a level of understanding about such things...

The story itself is not relevant, and probably is in necessary for the point I’m making, but I’m pissed and this shit is still raw...
My mother is an evil bitter twisted witch, having not spoken to her for 101/2 years, she changed her number to by pass my security blocks.  She tried financial blackmail to get me to do her bidding, she then played dead to panic my brother, and when I proved she was play acting she told me if I didn’t speak to her everyday she would cut my brother out of her life!...
Whilst my brother is 5 years older than me I’ve always hidden her narcissistic behaviour from him, but this time I I showed him everything.
I didn’t ask for my mother to contact me after 101/2 and I certainly didn’t ask for financial or emotional blackmail; however my brother is really hurt and he’s lashed out, he’s cut her dead, I know he knows it’s not my fault, I’ve done right thing and didn’t ask for her to throw a grenade on our lives, but I’m the punch bag whilst he’s processing it all.  
I know he’s being irrational, I know I’ve not done anything wrong, but he needs someone to blame and lash out at.  I could fight my corner and try and force him to see my side; or I could do what I’m doing, and just take it because I know he needs a punching bag at the moment.  
If I argue back I will lose, as you will with your daughter.  Logic and facts can not win arguments against emotional pain 

You can’t change an irrational mind, listen take it all on board, apologise for how your actions have made them feel, but do not apologise for your actions.  The more she pushthe firmer you need to be and if you have a few sessions you will get through to her and get your daughter back

They have everything, so asked for money and set up bank account as you have and also said they didn’t expect or want anything but to share their day with everyone.

And as I saw on a different reply, your parents paying for half doesn’t force you to agree to a guest list you’re not comfortable with.  It’s yours and your fiancés day.  As your Dad is one your side and Mum is peacekeeper maybe speak to Dad about it being an interest free loan that you’ll pay back so they aren’t paying for anything so you have complete say over your day?

Another edit having read more replies; as much as I’m all for girl power, your uncle isn’t going to listen to a word you say, let Dad do the man to man chat.  And yay Dad, he’s sounds like a really decent man!"

If you’re really unsure, ask him for a complete break until summer holidays when your back from college; you’ll either miss him terribly and call him after a few weeks or it’ll feel like a relief not hearing from him
