MultipleSclerosis,fqb83fh,t3_ghnxa7,1589232232.0,"I've always found it hard to summon the energy to exercise and would often just skip it all together. It's a vicious circle though as if I avoid any exercise I just end up feeling worse in the long run.

About 6 months ago I bought a virtual reality headset and actually it's been immensely helpful to get me moving. Games like Beatsaber (simply slicing blocks to the beat of music) are surprisingly fun which motivated me to actually move instead of sitting in front of the TV. Good exercise to as supposedly on higher difficulties it burns as much calories as tennis, according to [this report](https://vrhealth.institute/portfolio/beat-saber/), though even lower difficulties get you moving.

It of course doesn't replace proper exercise and not everyone will enjoy it, it's also expensive and can be a little complicated, but I went from doing virtually no exercise to being motivated to put on the headset everyday and doing some kind of activity."
MultipleSclerosis,fnlzuoh,t3_g2k2in,1587062624.0,"I went to the GP a few times but eventually I started to get tingling down my back, made an appointment and simply said I think it's MS. She said it's very unlikely but ordered an MRI and here I am!

It's best to just be upfront with your concerns, mention you're worried about MS and then ask for their opinion on it. I wouldn't try to push for a specific diagnosis but certainly raise it if it's on your mind. I sometimes write down all my symptoms beforehand and pass them the list since I would often poorly explain or forget to mention something. It's easier to convey that way and helps build a medical history."
Anxiety,fn6vmwn,t3_fzm0k0,1586708235.0,"I always used to have this problem though it helped to think of the benefits to activities in addition to relaxing.

Playing games for instance can help improve your problem solving skills and hand eye coordination. Reading boosts your creativity and improves your language skills. Little puzzles give your brain a workout. The hours of video you watch online might teach you something. Almost all hobbies have some kind of benefit like this, even if not immediately apparent, however the biggest benefit is happiness. If you enjoy something, that is reason alone to keep doing it. If we always had to use our time to maximum productivity it would be incredibly boring. Reddit would be empty!"
buildapcsalesuk,fhkiel9,t1_fhkhv7n,1581684381.0,"27GL850-B has USB ports and is a nano IPS meaning it can support the DCI-P3 colour space. Whilst the GL850 supports a wider colour gamut, it can oversaturate sRGB content unless you enable sRGB emulation.

If you don't want or need DCI-P3 (most content like games are sRGB) then you can happily save Â£200.

Take frequent breaks, don't overdo it and gradually you will be more comfortable in VR. If you are prone to motion sickness pointing a fan at you whilst playing might help take the edge off."

Hardware requirements will vary depending on the game. Beatsaber for instance is pretty easy to run though I would try to upgrade at some point, you might even be able to find an used i7 3770 to tide you over (edit: assuming desktop, if it's an OEM desktop check compatibility beforehand)"

unitedkingdom,eyuay1w,t3_cyu0dj,1567457389.0,"It largely depends on where you live.

If you live in a deprived town searching for unskilled work there will potentially be a hundred applicants for each job. You might be able to gain some qualifications or experience through schemes (less so now due to cuts) however, skilled work isn't really there. People in this area are also more likely to be suffering from various health issues.

Other factors come into play like public transport. It's expensive, slow, limited and unreliable particularly in rural areas. Some jobs might be inaccessible due to this, limiting your options.

Shift work in Mcdonalds with unpredictable hours might not be practical for someone with children. It might even make you worse off due to child care, travel costs etc. It depends on each situation.

The list is almost endless. It's not impossible to find a job but for some it can be very difficult due to a range of factors. Sometimes they just need a little support and guidance (something the jobcentre does not adequately provide) whereas others have big barriers like a disability which puts you at a huge disadvantage when competing with 99 other candidates."

Monitors,eynjlau,t3_cxu68m,1567250093.0,"The LG 27GL850 has better motion handling and a wide colour gamut.

The Asus PG279QE has a Gsync module and better contrast. It's likely the PG279QE uses the same panel as the PG279Q/Z, but it might be worth waiting for reviews of it.

[This TFTcentral article has a lot of information regarding Gsync/adaptive sync](https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/variable_refresh.htm#g-sync). With these two monitors specifically the Gsync module offers ULMB and variable overdrive.

If I was choosing between these two monitors I would personally save the $200 and get the LG as it has reviewed very well. It's main weakness is a below average contrast though every monitor has compromises, it just depends what you value most."
Monitors,eyiafih,t3_cx3s63,1567099726.0,"If deep blacks are a top priority then it is best to avoid any IPS panel, the LG especially.

The Acer will have better contrast however it comes with all the usual compromises of a VA panel which may or may not bother you.

I don't think a 980Ti can make use of Gsync compatible but it may be a relevent feature in the future when you upgrade."

In the grand scheme of things it's nothing groundbreaking but a lot of people were fed up with the poor quality control of AHVA panels and hope that LG brings some improvement in that area. Overall it's a decent monitor which has reviewed well from rtings and tftcentral."

The 970 PROs temperatures are very jumpy. Mine, even with a heatsink, shoots between 50-60C on the contoller due to normal background processes all the time.

Judging by your setup it's probably not due to over heating but still worth checking anyways."
