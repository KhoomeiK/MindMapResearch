ptsd,fohmb64,t3_g7cq8i,1587768334.0,"A bit of background info first: I am 32 years old. When I was 25-28 I was the only caregiver for my mom who died of lung cancer (she was my only true familial support system). My mother had also fallen from the opioid epidemic.

PTSD makes it so that I can‚Äôt breathe in crowds now. I struggle trusting people. I have my dream job, I enjoy my team, but some days I am distant and cold. I think something bad is always around the corner. I‚Äôve been through so much sometimes I think it‚Äôs impossible for me to relate to anyone or anyone to relate to me. I am afraid I‚Äôm going to be that girl that talks about her dead mom too much. 

Garth Brooks sings this song that goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm much too young to feel this damn old‚Äù and I swear he wrote that just for me. 

PTSD makes it so that my muscles clench up every time I‚Äôm anxious. My body is always tense. I have wept in more public places than I care to admit. I used to scream violently In my sleep. i have cried silently in so. Many. Stalls. For months I don‚Äôt even think I got up off the bedroom floor. I‚Äôm thankful everyday my fianc√© stayed. 

Every time I hear certain words like ‚Äúventilator, c-pap, narcan, breathing tube, overdose, or cancer‚Äù I inadvertently turn my head  and force myself to be present. Because otherwise, I go right back there. My childhood home I had to abandon, the hospital rooms, the waiting rooms, the ambulance rides, the steps outside to take a personal call, take your pick. 

Things that never bothered me before about my past creep back up now. Things I thought I got over. Things I thought I overcame. I guess this is what they mean when they say that it comes in all sorts of waves. 

You are not alone."
