Average cost of insulin in the US is between $300-500 per vial,  with an average of 2 vials used per month (average, since diabetes affects people differently).

That same vial costs like you said, $30-$40. A round trip to Montreal from SW Florida where I live is $500."

mentalillness,f5y5ira,t3_dpsg9e,1572551122.0,"Hey! First of all, this is awesome of you to reach out. Thanks for being open.

An important thing to remember is that as you come off medications, your brain will feel altered and fucked up but it won't last forever. Just stay strong in that. As for being worried about treatments you may not be able to afford, my personal advice is take your mental health more seriously than anything. A deteriorating mental status can and very well may ruin other things in life, so care for that first. If you need to put a hold on something like cutting back hours at work, going part time at school (idk if you're in high or college) but make this a priority.

Good luck, keep us updated, remember if people dont like you, strangers on the internet will‚ù§"
