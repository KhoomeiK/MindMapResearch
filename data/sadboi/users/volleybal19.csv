It sounds like you think your missing out on life and honestly you are. Your early 20's are for exploring and being selfish please don't miss out on that. Otherwise you'll just resent her"

relationships,eqanwva,t3_bxvg03,1559936574.0,My boyfriend (26 M) and I (25 F) have been together for almost 2 years and this past week has been super busy for the both of us. He recently started a new job and still working at his current job so we haven't been able to spend time together. But tonight we are going out for drinks with my cousin and his girlfriend who are in town. And tomorrow we are spending all day together because my sisters are having a graduation party. So I am just so excited to be spending the weekend with him and my family!!!
