bipolar,fmfjbo5,t3_fuycor,1586028447.0,"If your instinct is that you need help, I think you should trust your gut! I’m no saint when it comes to drinking and my meds but be careful! Benzodiazepines (Valium) and alcohol are potentiates which means they increase the effects of the other which is very dangerous! Benzodiazepines do have a very long half life, so take care with the alcohol. Also be kind to yourself, I hope you can seek the help you may or may not need, and thank you for sharing here.

bartenders,fizbajb,t1_fiy4vnh,1582858551.0,"Yes. When you work with other people things get dicey. I’m all about accountability but in the fury of things we’re all not perfect. And it depends on the POS and process at each business. I count my “zero’s” at the end of the shift or sequence numbers and actively ask other bartenders if they have them. But working with two other bartenders, and at least a bar back, slips end up anywhere. I’m very thorough but on the flip side I often find my coworkers slips in the morning  during the AM shift. Shit goes missing, no worries,  just thought it was a funny thought to see me looking around then just cut to a clip of what actually happened to that slip :P"

She asks me to serve her a shot discreetly and I obliged because the way I read the situation I thought she and her man were meeting up with people I thought might be hers or his parents. So I thought she might need some liquid courage on the DL. Super nice and seemingly responsible person. She steps away from the bar and I’m MORTIFIED. This was years ago and I still think of this often and fee so guilty. I would have said no, aaaand would not have gotten in trouble. “We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.”"
