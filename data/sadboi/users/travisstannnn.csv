leangains,foo7k6p,t3_g8jv9j,1587934041.0,"Iâ€™d say it depends on the workout. If itâ€™s a large lower body day then a fasted state might be hard to get through. I prefer to have food in me for any workout but I can sometimes get through a upper body fasted. I do like doing cardio fasted, that is defiantly doable. Usually the negatives for me working out fasted would be just feeling really unmotivated, lack of energy, everything moves slow and weight feels heavier than normal. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s all up to you on what your used to. Lifting fasted just doesnâ€™t make sense to me if your able to eat a couple hours before, performance is a lot better when you have some food in you (Make sure itâ€™s low on fat and protein for digestion if your gonna have a quick/close meal. It itâ€™s a few hours youâ€™ll probably be fine with digesting some protein and fat. Carbs are a blessing for pre and post workout. Oatmeal gives me really good energy I noticed if I have a bowl in the morning. Pre/post workout carbs should be a high glycemic carb but the rest of carbs can be low glycemic"
leangains,foo6v5h,t1_foo0vl9,1587933655.0,"Not Op but usually workouts donâ€™t work for people because theyâ€™re to long and they burnout, intensity is to high so they also burnout, a program thatâ€™s just to advanced for a beginner. Diets usually donâ€™t workout for some people because they try to eat to little and then eventually end up breaking the diet.  They could also be eating to little and training to hard for it to work out. You want to go with something where youâ€™re in a deficit like 500 less calories, and maintain that for a period of time with a balanced workout programs. If your getting into it, Iâ€™d suggest a 3 day lifting routine a week with it being 3 full body workouts. This can get you acclimated to lifting and dieting without pounding yourself down. Have your cardio on the same lift days or have on your off days or just mix it up."

If you eat super clean with no junk food you could lose some water weight pretty fast. I think an hour of lifting will suffice, I feel like 2 hours of lifting would be to much. You could do 3 full body workouts a week with the cardio and healthy eating and that will really help imo. Make sure the cardio is strenuous. You donâ€™t want to be lifting to long and to intense if your going to be in this big of a deficit so donâ€™t try to kill your self. An hour to an hour and a half should be good enough IMO. If you can use supersets and get through fast without lagging behind then an hour will probably be all you need. I always tell people a 500 calorie deficit should be good to start with. 750 I would think would be the highest deficit, and with only 10 lb loss as your goal I think you could handle the higher end deficit as long as your not slamming yourself into a wall with the workouts."
