1 package active dry yeast

1/4 cup water

3/4 cup milk, scalded

1/2 cup shortening 

1/2 cup sugar

2 tsp salt

4 1/2 to 4 3/4 cups flour

3 beaten eggs



Instructions:

Activate the yeast in warm water in separate container. Combine hot milk, shortening, sugar and salt; stirring until lukewarm. Add 1 cup of the flour; stir. Add yeast mixture and eggs, beating well. Stir in remaining flour.

Place the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 5 - 8 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl, rolling it once to grease the top of the dough. Cover and let rise until double.

Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Divide dough in thirds and Roll each third into a 9 inch circle. Brush with melted butter. Cut each circle in 12 wedge-shaped pieces. Roll each wedge up (wide end to point)

Arrange rolls, point down on greased baking sheet. Brush tops of rolls with melted butter. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees for 10 - 12 minutes.

Ôøº
If you have any questions or need any clarity, feel free to ask! I‚Äôve made these rolls every year of my life and I can assure you they will turn out amazing- perfect for thanksgiving too."

I‚Äôve went through a similar stage as your daughter has and what she needs right now is support. Wether she‚Äôs trying to find her spot in the world or is having some internal struggles, a parents job is to be there for your kids no matter what. If you want to know what is going on with your daughter, apologize for your actions first then ask her. She will never be honest or have respect for you if you back her into a corner. 
The reality is that she probably won‚Äôt respond well in the beginning but if you slowly nudge her in the right direction, things will get better.

I highly recommend counseling for both you and your daughter. If you are saying those things to her then there must be something wrong inside of you and for her to act this way indicates that she may need some help and support right now."

Pilate was indeed alive at the same time Jesus was and was living where the Bible said he interacted with Jesus, which is evidence that what the Bible said about him is true

Hezekiah is evidence because the Bible describes that specific underground tunnel where NO WHERE ELSE was it recorded that that tunnel existed 

David being alive and king when he was recorded to be doing so in the Bible is evidence because it wasn‚Äôt recorded anywhere else that he was a king in history let alone that time period, but, that stone confirmed it 

The reason they brought up YHVH is because there are no recordings of these people let alone a SPECIFIC god that the Bible mentions they worshiped, until that was found

The Nazareth home is evidence because people said that the Bible couldn‚Äôt be true because there‚Äôs no building that‚Äôs recorded to be aged around the time Jesus was alive, until they excavated that house

The pool of Saloam is evidence because no one knew or recorded of a pool in the city of Saloam, except in the Bible, and so finding it was evidence of the accuracy of the Bible 

Basically to sum up, all of these things that the tablets and stones say, prove the Bible is accurate and true because all of these tribes of people, places, and religions were never recorded anywhere and there was no evidence AT ALL of there existence nothing had been yet discovered‚Äîbut the Bible said it ALL before we ever uncovered these artifacts. Truly as if it is a history book. How else could it have this unknown information unless it had divine intelligence behind it?
