RowanUniversity,fos8ota,t3_g9a8av,1588025997.0,"Music appreciation and the geography class will be doable but a lot of work. I would not go past those two classes this summer, especially in the case of anatomy — there’s just too much material in this subject, it will be impossible. The best thing for you to do this summer is work on coding/hardware skills, and build yourself an online portfolio to get prepped for remote work. Good luck dude"

I totally hear what you’re saying, I hate to complain when other people have harder things going on, but I am really worried about being able to focus on these online classes. 

Does your university have an academic success center? I was literally about to drop out and then I found them and they set me up to get extra time on my exams/assignments. It’s been amazing. Consider looking into that?

Good luck to us both!"

Don’t be afraid to be selfish and put yourself first. When you get worn down, you really have to build yourself back up again. It will make you a better partner and friend.

Now you’ve got grit and you’re becoming more resilient everyday!! You can conquer anything, because you’ve done it before. I don’t know you, but I am so proud that you could see that all things pass and that you made it to the point you’re at today with your wonderful husband and dog — I’m sure you mean the world to them. Good luck on your first day, you will be phenomenal! You’ll be able to take on anything! And your co-workers will think you’re awesome too, because going through hard times can make you more empathetic to other people’s hardships and things we can’t see. 

Your dog will be okay, he loves you. Just remember you’re doing this for him! He will be so happy when you come home :) you’ve got this. Congratulations on this new chapter of your life!"
