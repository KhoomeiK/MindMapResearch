My ex boyfriend was ugly. Like really, really, really ugly. To be honest, I agreed with everyone who told me that. The thing that made me stay with him from as long is that he was confident, and he could carry intelligent conversation with me. Eventually he became abusive so I dumped him (besides the point) and within a few months he had another girlfriend who he abused the same way as me. The point is, coming from a girl, you can be ugly and be attractive. The most attractive thing about a guy is genuine interest in things. I love politics, philosophy, cooking, theatre, etc. if a guy can talk to me about it and shares an interest in it then he is 10x more attractive. Even if he‚Äôs fuck ugly. 

I hope this helps"
