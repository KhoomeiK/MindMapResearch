My ex boyfriend was ugly. Like really, really, really ugly. To be honest, I agreed with everyone who told me that. The thing that made me stay with him from as long is that he was confident, and he could carry intelligent conversation with me. Eventually he became abusive so I dumped him (besides the point) and within a few months he had another girlfriend who he abused the same way as me. The point is, coming from a girl, you can be ugly and be attractive. The most attractive thing about a guy is genuine interest in things. I love politics, philosophy, cooking, theatre, etc. if a guy can talk to me about it and shares an interest in it then he is 10x more attractive. Even if he’s fuck ugly. 

I hope this helps"

Seriously though, I know how you feel. I’m chubby. I’m ugly, I’m covered in acne. I hate my hair (shaved it all for charity, it looks awful now). I’m uglier than all the other girls around me. I can’t even starve myself properly, I always cave in and eat something. I’m recovered from an eating disorder and I wish so badly I was still starving myself. All these other girls are so beautiful. They have perfect skin, hair, smiles, bodies, loads of friends, etc etc etc. I just want someone to look at me and think that I’m beautiful but that’s never going to happen and I’m at the end of my rope. Even if I end up looking good later in life I’m never going to be as pretty as other girls. I’m never going to be wanted or loved and I feel like killing myself over it.
