You need to give her time to decide if this is something she can get over and trust you again. If not well you were really walking a dangerous line.

Anxiety,f1nc6p2,t3_da28el,1569613845.0,"Hey im actually training to be an eye doctor!  I am studying in Ireland so some procedures maybe me more common where you live, the usual spiel in our clinics is;  
1-  You show up to your appointment, they sign you in.

  
2- Usually a technician will come to do some screening tests to make sure your eyes are healthy, these are general and done for everyone.

  
 This usually involves getting your eye pressures taken-for this you are sitting with your chin on the chinrest of the machine and when the machine gets your eye into perfect focus it will give 3 separate puffs of air into your eye. This always makes me jump, but thats natural! It doesnt hurt at all  
They also usually get a picture of the back of your eye, for this you're also sitting and you just have to keep your eye open wide for a few seconds, nothing touches your eye.   
Some times they use an autorefractor, it usually has a balloon or a house that seems to be going into the distance. For this you just have to keep looking at the target and the machine will figure out approximately what prescription your eyes need as a starting point for the doctor. Here nothing touches your eye either.

  
3- The doctor comes to pick you up after the initial tests. They will bring you to the exam room and get you comfy. They usually take a history including any medical  / eye issues that exist in your family. This helps them decide if they have to do any other tests. Definitely during the conversation section let them know youre a little anxious and ask them to explain what they will be doing!!    
Then after the history they will start seeing how well your eyes see, first one by one then together. After they will focus on getting you to read as best as you can on each eye individually. When both eyes are done they will balance them together so that it feels most comfortable for you. There is no wrong answers just answer which lenses look better to you and if at any point they look identical thats fine too! Theres no trick questions and dont worry there are many mini checks we as doctors do for ourselves to make sure we get you to the right point.   
You didnt mention your age but sometimes they do all this again close up incase you need more help reading things like food labels  than seeing far away.

  
4. In small discount store opticians they usually limit what they do per test, so tests last 20-30 minutes and unless your family has a history of eye disease or you have symptoms besides not being able to read close up they wont do anything much more than that.

  
5. After your test is done usually they tell you what they found and if you need new glasses. Then they bring you out to the shop floor for you to look at frames. If this is too much and youre stressed after the exam just let them know youd like a copy of your prescription. Then you can come in another day to look at frames or just go to a different store entirely to get your glasses.  

  
ETC- just to address some of the comments

If you have a history of glaucoma in the family or if your eye pressures from the air puff are high they might make you do a 'fields test', this is just to check that each eye had the full field of view that its meant to, for this you put your head into a white bowl that looks like a big fish bowl. you just have to look straight ahead and if you see a little flash/flicker of light from the corner of your eye you press a button. It might be boring but its not scary. Usually if  you get tired you can hold down the button and it will pause the test.

The user who said they have high pressures and usually need a second test, thats called goldmann tonometry in most cases, either way if they need to do this they will put an anesthetic drop in your eye, not because it would hurt otherwise, but just so you dont feel it and be uncomfortable, the front of your eye is quite sensisitve. Then they gently rest the circular piece, its very tiny, 3mm in diameter, against the front of your eye. the machine tells them ta super accurate reading so they know how to plan for you better.

And taking a picture of the back of the eye doesn't sting! I know what the user meant but it might only sting because you have to keep your eyes wide open for a few seconds in front of bright lights. Nothing will actually cause stinging.

Im sorry this is so long but i hope its thorough enough to ease you a little. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!"
