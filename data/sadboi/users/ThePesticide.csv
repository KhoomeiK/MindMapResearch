I guess we won’t agree with each other here which is fine, but he never said he wanted to test the effects of injecting disinfectants into patients with corona virus, he made an analogy/idea about if we could possibly develop some kind of treatment “that’s not a disinfectant” that works similar to how a disinfectant works outside the body, and he suggested that medical experts should look into it and test it.. there, I explained it how it was since you don’t like long paragraphs. 

And you haven’t provided anything to backup your claim, you just basically restated your belief on what he meant lol."
PoliticalHumor,fqrdmhh,t1_fqr4yk2,1589582297.0,"Lol nobody ever mentioned that injecting disinfectants was a good idea. Stop putting words in my mouth and read what I said, don’t just jump to conclusion that I’m dumb just because I “defended trump” do you want to talk about this in a civilized manner or do you just want to throw names and false assumptions? 

All I said was that he was making a comparison to how disinfectants work. I’m literally quoting him lol, he’s making an analogy of how it would be interesting to have a safe oral treatment that kills the virus similar to how a disinfectant kills the virus. It’s not that difficult to understand that he’s talking about if they could possibly have a treatment that’s not a “toxic disinfectant” but that works similar to how a disinfectant works outside the body. Again he’s asking his medical advisors or experts about how it would be interesting if they could develop something that can be safely consumed, and he mentions that doctors have to look into it first obviously just like they’re currently looking into first obviously. 

Nobody is saying to drink disinfectants or bleach, i am not suggesting to drink disinfectant or bleach. I’m repeating myself since you want to accuse me of it; by asking me if you want to explain why it’s a bad idea, of course it’s a bad idea and I never promoted it. I’m just simply telling you that trump never suggested drinking toxic disinfectants or cleaning chemicals. 

You misinterpreted it and I don’t blame you, the dude sometimes comes off as an idiot when he talks about a subject he knows nothing about, he made the worst analogy/comparison but it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was. First time this news came out, I actually thought he recommended people to drink infectants to prevent the virus, I looked at the tape and it wasn’t the case. He simply made an awkward analogy/comparison but he never suggested to drink disinfectants, never. But we can all agree that he still sounded dumb nonetheless even though he never actually said that we should drink disinfectants. 

The key word here is analogy or similarity, he’s not saying that he wants the treatment to have disinfectant properties, this literally has nothing to do with disinfectants, it was just a random comparison he pointed out. Again that was his choice of words, I’m sure he regrets it but we both agree that he sounded dumb, no doubt. 

But I’m not one sided, I’ll backup anybody who has been misrepresented, wether that’s Hillary, trump, Obama, Bernie, Biden. It seems like you think I support “trump” not the case but it’s interesting how if you “defend him” or talk good about him, you’re instantly attacked by people."
PoliticalHumor,fqr4eqa,t1_fqqof5h,1589577387.0,"(“And is there a way we can do something like that”) is pretty much all the context you need to read to understand that he never suggested ingesting disinfectants. 

Rhetorically speaking, he’s asking one of the health experts on his team if they could maybe work on a treatment that works similar to the way disinfectants work. Nobody is suggesting injecting toxic chemicals, he was making an analogy that sounded interesting to him. The comparison was about how he thought it would be a good idea if they could make a treatment in a pill form that could kill the virus inside the body, similar to how disinfectants kill the virus outside of the body. 

Now the way he mentions this information was bad, because even though I and a lot of people understood what he meant, it’s not that hard to misinterpret what he’s saying, especially when the mainstream media, not only cnn, try to title their articles saying “trump suggests injecting disinfectants” which is clearly false. 

Also this post was a joke I made, idk what trump has to do with this, but I’m Canadian and I don’t really support any of these political figures/nominees. 

That being said, I honestly think trump should be a lot more careful with his words when speaking to an audience. One wrong word can make him look like the devil, especially because he’s the president of the United States and all eyes are constantly on him. Obama is a good example of how a president should speak."

Here’s what you can message them to inform them about the event and how they can benefit from it, a brief introduction about your intention:
