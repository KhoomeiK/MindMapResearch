TrueCrime,fpn9ryo,t1_fp156ah,1588755228.0,"I can answer the question about the surgeries as I am the mother of a medically fragile child. My son has a 3 chambered heart instead of 4 and has to go through 3 surgeries to reroute his blood flow in order to live.  He’s had two of them and is awaiting the third. My son is two. He cannot tell the doctor his symptoms. If I was a mom that wanted attention and I wanted the surgery now on my little two year old because it garners more sympathy than a four year old laying in a hospital with fresh chest incisions, I could lie to his cardiologist about symptoms and fast track him to a sedated echocardiogram (general anesthesia) at minimum and at maximum get him into the cath lab for a heart catheterization (general anesthesia and a camera goes into the hearts vessels and things can/do go very wrong).  I couldn’t get them to do the full on open heart surgery if the cath results showed he didn’t need it right away, but how would I convince them of the other two procedures? He’s sleeping all the time, he’s sweating really bad when he eats, he coughs when he gets out of breath, he’s turning blue when he’s tired/out of breath/crying, his oxygen saturation’s have been dipping into the 60’s and very slowly coming back up (we have a pulse oximeter at home, anything below 70 requires inpatient oxygen), things that would signify he was outgrowing his last surgery and needing the next step. Doctors expect that you want the best for your child and the least intrusive therapies, they aren’t thinking about you being that 1 in 10,000 by proxy mom."

askwomenadvice,fofj2bs,t3_g6vk1j,1587736949.0,"My story is kind of similar. My fiancée was just downright mean, condescending, argumentative and the good times were getting farther apart and shorter in duration.  I couldn’t confide in him, seek comfort in him because he was just so cold. I couldn’t take it but I love my stepchildren dearly and have a two year old with him who has a critical heart defect.  I counteracted the negativity and depression with the antidepressants Lexapro and Wellbutrin. He saw that I was healthy mentally and avoiding getting upset by avoiding him. Then this Covid happened. He was unable to work but we are still able to live comfortably between the increased unemployment and the stimulus checks. Work was definitely a stressor and I feel like me only working two shifts a week caused some tension when we were working. Now we are both unable to work and are pretty much equals and he was able to be in a good mood because he was home with his kids as he is a family man.  And it was just like something clicked. He no longer always had his brows furrowed and looking angry and less attractive. He was smiling and content and the man that I find strikingly handsome finally was morphing back into himself. When he started treating me nicely and it stayed that way, my thought process changed from, “why leave this man when I can just deal with it,” to “thank goodness he came around after FIVE years, now we can finally both be happy.” I can tell he doesn’t miss the tension and fighting and it’s been 5 (or so) weeks on quarantine. I am definitely worried about when he goes back to work but I honestly believe that he is ready to be a good man. He’s 33 and his oldest is 13 so it’s about damn time.  Think about all of the things that drew you to him in the first place, he has all of that inside of him but life changes us. But he wants to be good to you so let him and see how it goes. Look at him when he’s sleeping and ask yourself, would I rather end it with this man and wind up in another relationship that may or may not become stagnant, or find what I love about him allover again? He didn’t cheat on you, so giving him another chance may just salvage your love for him. And this time HE is wanting it and he is wanting YOU!"

Relapsing while having a medically dependent child is a horrible choice and this little girl would be home with her mom if she hadn’t made that choice. I’m an addict, too, that’s how this came on FB feed.  I’ve been clean for 5 years now and have a child with a critical congenital heart defect and he requires one more of 3 surgeries and I could never fathom trusting him in someone else’s care and throwing it all away to get high."
