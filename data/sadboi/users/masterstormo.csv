The line also has products like under-eye cream (which is to help with wrinkles) so I don’t think 9-13 year olds are the target audience. Idk though, maybe they are just missing the mark all together. 

I feel bad for Millie Bobby Brown tbh. Her parents push her to do a bunch of shit to make money off of her, so it seems like an overall cringey money grab. It feels very Steve Buscemi “How do you do, fellow kids” to me."

The only words of advice I can give is to take time to pay attention to how you are feeling. Take a lunch nap if you need. Go to bed early if you need. Take a little walk if you need.
