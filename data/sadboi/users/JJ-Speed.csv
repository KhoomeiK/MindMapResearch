AvPD,fqxp0ze,t3_g8dzfa,1589735709.0,"I practice mindfulness and take herbal supplements. Mindfulness helps me re-wire my brain to think positively about life and myself. I also started St. John‚Äôs Wort and L-Theanine every morning with coffee. After about 2 weeks, I noticed that my depressive mood and social anxiety disappeared almost entirely. Now I can confidently talk to anyone. Before that, I would get gut-wrenching anxiety anytime someone came near me."
AvPD,fqxcj1l,t1_fqwqiwf,1589729937.0,That is actually a very good question. I actually think most of us would still choose loneliness even if we knew someone with our same exact issue.
AvPD,fqtgu43,t3_gksptx,1589638723.0,I used to do the same thing before I got married. I would have several flings with various women and just completely ghost them...I probably couldn‚Äôt even find them on social media now. But I purposely chose women who I clearly had no future with because it eliminated the possibility of disappointment or rejection. But eventually I found the right one and love overcame my toxic habits.
MaladaptiveDreaming,fqtdulr,t3_fzjk05,1589636948.0,"Cardio is where it‚Äôs at. It‚Äôs been my saving grace. Running, biking, swimming, lifting, etc. is where I MD now. I‚Äôm married with a kid so I can‚Äôt risk getting caught at home. And exercise socially acceptable and is much more productive than pacing around a room. At least you‚Äôll have a great physique to show for it. Nobody can down you for being a fitness freak."
AvPD,fqtbivm,t1_fqsa5y2,1589635373.0,"I don‚Äôt think so. True friendships require effort on both ends to be maintained. However, since they really like each other, they don‚Äôt view maintaining their relationship as a chore."
AvPD,fqps473,t1_fqpr2zv,1589552941.0,"True. However, I understand that I can‚Äôt have my cake and eat it too. I can‚Äôt avoid people and go ghost on them but then expect to have strong healthy bonds. I‚Äôm literally doing the opposite of what I should be doing. But it‚Äôs such a chore to keep up with people! Ugh!"
MaladaptiveDreaming,fqpj5gd,t1_fqkiewq,1589547653.0,"Idk it‚Äôs weird. Despite my life is actually quite amazing right now, I just struggle to find true pleasure out of real life. Back when I used to MD a lot, I feel like life was more bearable because I could look forward to MD‚Äôing at the end of the day. Weed and alcohol are usually the only things help my mood. When I used to MD, I was completely sober."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fqphph8,t3_g7ngcx,1589546674.0,"I over came by force. I never told my wife about my MD‚Äôing before we got married. This is because I was ashamed of it and I didn‚Äôt even consider it conversation-worthy anyway. Plus I would only MD late at night so it never interfered with my real life and relationships. 

So after the wedding, we moved into this small apartment. I was no longer in my parent‚Äôs house which was large enough for me to isolate myself from everyone else. I no longer had the personal space and time alone that I was used to. So I adjusted by just quitting MD‚Äôing cold turkey since I never really had an opportunity to have a full MD ‚Äúsession‚Äù. 

However, it still has adverse affects. After a few months of not being able to MD, I started to have an overall depressed mood and gut-wrenching anxiety for no apparent reason. I feel like when I MD‚Äôd in the past, it was to get rid of those feelings and it worked. But now I have no outlet. As a kid, although I was shy at times, my MD‚Äôing gave me so much joy that I didn‚Äôt even really care about real life. But now all I have is real life...which obviously sucks in comparison to my fantasy world. So it‚Äôs almost like I traded in my weird quirky habit for anxiety & depression."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fqpfevg,t1_fqhk9i6,1589544980.0,"Honestly, I‚Äôve opened up to my wife about everything and she didn‚Äôt respond well. She pretty much asked me to not speak about my mental health issues again because it weirds her out. She thinks I can overcome my mental issues by ignoring them and focusing on real life."
AvPD,fqnb45u,t1_fqn42hp,1589491738.0,Yes. I want to hear more about practical tips on how to overcome it rather than ‚Äúlecture-style‚Äù videos.
AvPD,fqljwht,t3_gj8kx6,1589459998.0,"I think environmental factors have a lot to do with everyone‚Äôs quality of life. But your environment is just one of the cards life dealt you. How you play that card determines whether or not you will be successful. 

My parents moved us to a white upper middle class suburb. As a black kid, I felt inadequate because all the popular kids in school seemed to be white and have better lives than I did. As I got older (towards senior year of HS), I started meet the kids that lived on the other side of my town which was more ethnic and urban. I could fully relate to those kids because they weren‚Äôt spoiled like the rich white kids from my school. This showed me that my environment was a mismatch for me. 

I feel like had I grown up on the other side of town, I would‚Äôve fit in a lot better and my attachment style would be more secure. It sucks that I had to wait until senior year of high school to finally have a group of friends I could relate to. Being an insecure kid surrounded by a bunch of entitled jerks was recipe for disaster. 

But what‚Äôs in the past is in the past. Can‚Äôt cry over spilled milk."
AvPD,fqlhikz,t3_gjgpv1,1589458252.0,"Omg I can definitely relate to the part where you said sometimes you think you‚Äôre smiling in a picture but you‚Äôre actually frowning lol! That has happened to me so many times. It‚Äôs even worse when the person taking the picture keeps telling you to smile and you get frustrated because think you are. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt want to full smile because I feel smiling makes me vulnerable...it gives me something to lose. But if I‚Äôm indifferent and cold, then I stand to lose nothing."
AvPD,fqd8kdy,t1_fqclmze,1589283269.0,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. Sometimes I feel like my wife‚Äôs extroversion is too much to deal with with the constant socializing. But I always just tell myself that it‚Äôs for my own good...because I would be a hermit without her. 

So I assume you aren‚Äôt glad for the social life he has afforded you?"
AvPD,fqb1pl3,t3_emdnmt,1589229039.0,"1. Work: I go to work, I don‚Äôt speak to anyone unless it‚Äôs necessary, I do the bare minimum required to keep my job, and I rush home every single day! I have no relationships with my co-workers outside of the limited interaction we have on the shift.

2. Vices: After work, I just roll up a joint and get high every single day. Then I wake and bake on the weekends. I also drink a lot of wine and liquor. Luckily many of my friends are also heavy drinkers and smokers so it‚Äôs a point of contact for me to others.

3. Social Circle: I‚Äôm married to an extrovert so she keeps the social traffic coming in. I‚Äôm lucky to have her because without her, I would like have no friends or social circle. Most of my guy friends are the boyfriends/husbands of her girlfriends. (Those are the guys I smoke and drink with)

4. Family: I‚Äôm quite distant from my family as they are the main cause of my mental issues and they typically trigger the most negative emotions from me. I only visit or talk to them when absolutely necessary. So I only see them whenever holidays and birthdays bring us together...and I prefer it that way, even though I‚Äôm always criticized for being so scarce."
AvPD,fqa3dpe,t3_ezy48p,1589212100.0,"Weed does me well too. I wouldn‚Äôt say that it makes things clearer but it just shuts of the part of my brain that would normally be ruminating about past negative experiences. In social situations, I may not be as sharp but I can always blame it on the weed lol. Being high all the time actually gives me an excuse to be in my own world when I do finally see people. And most people I come across also smoke weed. So it actually becomes a way to socialize with folks that I would normally be too afraid to approach. I always have weed, concentrates, edibles, etc. so everyone calls me ‚Äúthe plug‚Äù. I don‚Äôt sell weed but I always have it on deck. Weed is temporarily saving my life right now."
AvPD,fq67ugv,t1_fq5v9h9,1589126252.0,"Facts. I usually have no problems making acquaintances but I just suck at keeping up with them. I know that maintaining a relationship can be as simple as sending a text every other week but I‚Äôm terrified of doing that. 

I honestly meet great people but I feel like they will inevitably hurt me so I distance myself. Then they get hurt because they think I‚Äôm rejecting them but the opposite is true."
AvPD,fq28dnp,t3_gglvmm,1589053756.0,"I definitely have horrible outbursts of rage. I‚Äôm mild-mannered and very passive for the most part. But when someone pushes my buttons...then boy are they in for a surprise! This is typically because we never express how we truly feel...we just bottle it up. So when we finally do reach a breaking point, we boil over. But it feels good as hell after. I usually end up laughing about the whole situation after finally blowing up."
AvPD,fq26b0b,t3_fzxlzp,1589053218.0,"Wow...I literally wrote a post just like this lol. I‚Äôm the same as you bro. My life looks beautiful on the outside. Corporate job, fancy car, smokin‚Äô hot wife, large social circle, seemingly healthy family life, etc. But I feel the same as you. I‚Äôm terrified of even seeing my own friends and family despite their outward approval of me. I‚Äôm so hypersensitive to criticism that I can take anything someone says to me offensive. And work is a whole other story. I contemplate quitting several times a day. No other place makes me feel as inadequate as work does...besides my toxic childhood household of course. 

But I put a similar post and most people told me to keep pushing. We‚Äôre blessed to have accomplished this much despite battling AvPD. Gotta hold on and fight the good fight!!"

I didn‚Äôt want her to view me as less of a man. So my fear of losing her motivated me to accomplish things in the real world. Sounds toxic as fuck...but at least it resulted in something positive. Never underestimate the power of love. Before I met her, I was constantly isolated in my childhood bedroom. She motivated me to come outside...she definitely saved my 20‚Äôs and probably saved my entire life."
Jcole,fpvui28,t3_g2htcw,1588952069.0,He‚Äôs always been good at incorporating melody into his music. His voice is better at carrying emotion than Kendrick and Drake but it‚Äôs sorta dull in comparison. I personally prefer when all of them just fuckin rap. I love Cole‚Äôs rhyming voice over Drake and Kendrick. Sometimes Drake sounds corny and Kendrick is just too fuckin much. Cole gives me that mellow but slightly aggressive early 2000s east coast flow.

AvPD,fpu9623,t3_emplu4,1588907411.0,"Yes. 

My father had an explosive temper. I was absolutely TERRIFIED of my dad growing up. He would physically beat me with his bare hands, electrical cords, hangers, etc. There have even been extreme cases where he tried to stick a need in my foot bottom. He also attacked me with a frying pan before. He always did these thing when there were no witnesses. 

I called a family meeting to address the abuse. He denied every bit of it. So it was his word vs mine. He always appeared very blissful and cheery to everyone else. But when it was me and him at home alone, he would unleash all his anger on me. He would constantly have me in the yard doing work and taking down to me about how inadequate I am at doing yard work. Many of my beatings would happen out in the yard. 

The abuse was so bad that one time he went to hug me and I flinched. But since then, our dynamic has changed. He no longer holds any power over me so now we can just talk as two men. Surprisingly, we have gotten a lot closer in my adulthood but his abuse still bothers me every now and then. One on hand, I want to have an honest conversation with him about it. But then on the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to ruin what we have now. This is the best our relationship has been."

hiphopheads,fprnx1i,t3_gbzbt2,1588858535.0,"It a great collection of songs. I never expected this tape to be a classic or anything but I‚Äôm glad he officially released all the leaks and some new bops. I love the way he‚Äôs spitting on songs like ‚ÄúDeep Pockets‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen To Say When‚Äù, ‚ÄúChicago Freestlye‚Äù, and ‚ÄúLosses‚Äù. At the end of the day, those are 4 tracks where Drake is ‚Äòrapping rapping‚Äô over dope sampled beats. These songs will sorta hold me over for the Spring until the album drops in the Summer. 

But if you compare this to his other albums, it‚Äôs probably his worst. But if you judge it for what actually is...a mixtape, then this project is excellent!"
hiphopheads,fprmntc,t1_fprmgiv,1588857745.0,True shit.

I was born in ‚Äò91 and I had to do extensive research to learn about Wu-Tang because I wasn‚Äôt outside while their music was poppin. But the typical person who isn‚Äôt a musichead is not going to do all of that. They will just simply know the music of their time. And yes, a lot of 80‚Äôs rap is simplistic. I‚Äôm not saying it was bad by a long shot...these are classics we‚Äôre talking about. I‚Äôm just saying that the ‚Äúlyrical miracle‚Äù style of rap they you‚Äôre referring to didn‚Äôt even exist until the 90‚Äôs. So you have a limited view of what hip-hop is if you only focus on the ‚ÄúGolden Era‚Äù. There was a time in hip-hop before then."
hiphopheads,fprlbvc,t1_fprizbf,1588856900.0,I know not to get caught up in titles. But I think it‚Äôs important to make distinctions when it comes time to have hip-hop debates and make comparisons to other artists.
hiphopheads,fprl3r2,t1_fprjquc,1588856754.0,Drake has actually bars though. He had mixtapes prior to blowing up with him actually rapping. And Drizzy simply incorporates melody into his music but he‚Äôs primarily a rapper. Roddy is 100% singing.
hiphopheads,fprh7y2,t3_gf59t4,1588854060.0,"I feel like the ‚Äúmumble rap‚Äù sound has been the longest lasting musical phase in hip-hop. I still prefer this mumble rap phase over the ‚Äúsnap dance‚Äù era in the mid-late 00s but it‚Äôs time for a change.

I‚Äôm a hip-hop head who loves old school 90‚Äôs rap, but I don‚Äôt mind the non-lyrical forms of hip-hop. It exists for a purpose and obviously that‚Äôs what the majority of people prefer to hear. Hip-hop wasn‚Äôt always lyrical. Listen to some rap records from the 70‚Äôs & 80‚Äôs. They were all spitting simplistic, lighthearted rhymes over feel-good beats. So I‚Äôm never going to condemn artists for doing hip-hop in its purest form...party music. 

At this point, you just have to do your job as a fan and SEEK out the music you want to hear. There is plenty of lyrical rap available now. Check out rappers on Dreamville, TDE, or Griselda Record for example. Between those 3 camps, there are like 10 lyrical emcees to listen to. 

The radio and TV don‚Äôt control what fans listen to anymore. If you have a streaming service, just simply ignore the bullshit and click on the real shit. There is no excuse in 2020 for anyone to be complaining about music...you just simply aren‚Äôt looking. Unfortunately, gone are the days where the songs on the radio were good enough."

AvPD,fpcn8ob,t1_fp9f4xv,1588506775.0,Glad I could touch on this subject. This has been something that has always bothered me. But I guess we just gotta fake it til we make it. Empathy may come natural to others but we just have to make an extra effort to let our loved ones know we‚Äôre there.
AvPD,fp9dhs7,t3_fb2ep2,1588423143.0,"This is 100% accurate. Many times I‚Äôll just take whatever information I have gathered on my own to draw the conclusion that all the people in my life are a bunch of judgmental assholes. I automatically assume that they will say something critical and will somehow make me the butt of the joke. There have been times where my fears have been confirmed but I have also conveniently ‚Äúforgot‚Äù all the times they didn‚Äôt make me feel this way. This causes me to avoid social gatherings...ESPECIALLY with my own family. 

My wife actually helped me get through this. I started telling her about the times that our family members and friends have said things that upset me. She understood my pain but advised that I‚Äôm actually not treated any better or worse than anyone else based on her observation. I‚Äôm just hypersensitive to criticism so it really sticks whenever it does happen.

Reading this post really showed me how my avoidance hurts those around me. There have been many occasions that I have avoided due to fear. I also NEVER reach out to my family. I only see them during holidays and birthday celebrations. They always ask me why I‚Äôm so scarce. I always rebut that comment by saying that communication is 2-way street...basically pointing the finger back at them. But can I really blame them? Due to my toxic habits, I probably don‚Äôt seem very approachable and they would probably assume that I will reject them if they reached out...ironic huh? 

Now that I have this awareness, I will start to be more socially and emotionally available to the people in my life. I might even shoot a ‚Äúhow are you doing?‚Äù text now. I have allowed my fear of PERCEIVED rejection to result in the ACTUAL rejection of my loved ones. In a way, I‚Äôve become the very thing I hate. 

Thank you so much for this post!"
AvPD,fp3av7k,t1_fp38qwo,1588276111.0,Well said.
AvPD,fp33anm,t3_fvcz14,1588272354.0,A lot of the harsher symptoms are hard to accept but they are true. No avoidant wants to admit to lacking empathy but it‚Äôs part of the disorder. We often go out of our way for others not because we truly care about them...but rather because we don‚Äôt want to deal with any potential criticism for being ‚Äúselfsish‚Äù.
AvPD,fp2yb8g,t3_g5sjci,1588269928.0,"I‚Äôve experienced both hypersensitivity to rejection and coldness and apathy towards most people and things. I may appear self-less because I‚Äôm constantly catering to others and going out of my way for people. But this is actually motivated by fear of criticism and rejection. So I often do favors and ‚Äòfake-empathize‚Äô with people not because I want to make them happy...but rather because I want to protect myself from being criticized and labeled ‚Äúselfish‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôm not genuinely caring of the affairs of others yet I take it so personally if someone calls me out for it. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt care to truly love people but I still want them to think of me as loving. But the apathy I feel is not for lack of caring though. My brain just simply doesn‚Äôt assign the correct emotion to the circumstance. Hence, it‚Äôs the same reason I feel like I‚Äôm about to be attacked by a pack of wolves by just passing a coworker in the hallway."
AvPD,fp2udlq,t3_gap15u,1588268043.0,"I‚Äôve struggled with this my whole life! This is because I‚Äôm generally apathetic towards anything besides my own interests...which are very niche and weird. This has caused me to have a great deal of trouble connecting with people...especially when they‚Äôre hurting. 

This is because I can‚Äôt really empathize with most people despite knowing what they‚Äôre going through. For example, I‚Äôve lost a loved one who was very dear to me in the past. But I just reacted by withdrawing...not crying or expressing emotion. So it‚Äôs hard for me to relate to someone who‚Äôs crying about a death. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know what to say or do. 

I also notice that things that evoke a strong emotional response from most people, have no effect on me whatsoever. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care. I truly want to care and be connected but my emotions just don‚Äôt connect to my brain properly. I guess this is part of the disorder because my brain triggers negative emotional responses even when it‚Äôs not warranted. 

As a result, I‚Äôve become an Oscar-worthy actor lol! I‚Äôve forced myself to socialize enough that I know how to follow social cues. I can recognize the type of emotion that I‚Äôm supposed to have and I just act on it. It kinda sad but I get a kick out of it sometimes. 

I have pretended to be outraged and offended about things to fit in all the time. I‚Äôve even pretended to be bubbly and excited about something when I couldn‚Äôt care less. I just know which emotion fits what mood and I just follow suit so that I will be accepted. It‚Äôs worked thus far. But I wish I could truly feel what others felt."
AvPD,fp2slga,t3_gawn81,1588267199.0,"Quarantine is actually hell if you live with other people. I feel like I have less time to myself. When outside was open, I would normally have a few hours alone to myself since I get home before my wife. I was able to take lunch breaks alone and MD in my car...but now my wife wants to tag along anywhere I go since she‚Äôs bored. And she would be upset if I told her to stay home. 

Being an introvert/avoidant/loner doesn‚Äôt really work when everyone else is inside too lol. Staying home in this case defeats the purpose. Granted there hasn‚Äôt been any pressure to attend social events...but I was actually starting to face my social phobias and get out more. But COVID-19 stopped my progress in its tracks and I have to rebuild from scratch. 

Quarantine has also made me more tempted to abuse substances. I would normally just MD or watch porn to ‚Äúescape‚Äù. But since I don‚Äôt live alone, I can‚Äôt do those things in peace. This has led to a drastic increase in my marijuana and alcohol consumption. I find it easier to stay sober when I have other outlets.

Honestly, what really helped me socially during my teens was the church. You can join a local church‚Äôs youth group. Since they‚Äôre Christians, they‚Äôll naturally be very nice and accommodating. Even if you aren‚Äôt religious, you can find a good place to fit in a youth group. Many of their lessons and programs are catered towards confused teens as yourself. Plus church girls are way easier to approach and date than regular chicks. This is because many church kids are also reserved just like you...so they won‚Äôt judge you as much. Many of my current friends in adulthood were kids I went to church with...and none of us are even still religious. 

But if you are anti-religion, you can just find one solid friend and focus on them. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to have a ‚Äúsquad‚Äù. You always have college. College makes it a lot easier to make friends. This is because people are more mature and that popularity hierarchy in high school doesn‚Äôt really exist in college for the most part. In college, people are more likely to appreciate your unique qualities rather than make fun of them like they do in high school. Plus, you get a fresh new reputation once you step foot on your new college campus."

AvPD,fouzwku,t3_g9qncx,1588093115.0,I agree with you. Texting is ridiculous. But just learn how to use emojis to color your text. Saying ‚ÄúüòÇü§£üòÇ‚Äù is much better than saying a dry ‚Äúlol‚Äù.
AvPD,fouyfga,t3_g8qvhg,1588092433.0,"I‚Äôm a 29 year old man. I definitely have AvPD and my life has been tremendously hindered by it in many ways. However, I‚Äôm not the typical AvPD story because I‚Äôm not a complete recluse and I‚Äôve been able to get and hold jobs. I‚Äôm also married with a child on the way. I own a house, have a good job, drive a nice car, have a large social circle, etc. At this point, you probably think that I don‚Äôt really have AvPD but you couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Throughout the years, I have been criticized for being weird, distant, cold, awkward, etc. But I just kept an a aura of confidence that made people like me nonetheless. 

I used my fear of criticism and rejection as motivation to fix the most vulnerable areas of my life. So everything about my life looks good on paper. But what people don‚Äôt see is how as a grown ass man, I have mini-panic attacks before seeing my own best friends. I avoid my immediate family like the plague because they are the source of a lot my anxiety. I‚Äôm not close to my mom like most people. This is because she was very critical and expected the worst of me growing up. I‚Äôve also struggled with every single job I‚Äôve had despite how high-paying it was. I‚Äôm a compulsive maladaptive daydreamer but I‚Äôve never been caught because I‚Äôm a master at hiding my mental issues. 

I could give you some advice on what to do and what not to do. Although I‚Äôm proud of the life I‚Äôve built, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm proud of the motivation behind it. I have a good looking life but I‚Äôm still depressed and anxious out my freakin mind. I did it so I can look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù...so that people would like me and not reject me. But I still feel rejected even by people who are actually very accepting of me in real life. 

1. Get to the root of your trauma. 

2. Avoid solitude! It‚Äôs not good for folks like us. Solitude just feeds the beast that is AvPD. 

3. Find purpose and stay busy! Just find out what your passion is and put all your time into it. If you don‚Äôt have a passion, find a job and work it like it‚Äôs your passion. This will keep you mindful so you don‚Äôt waste hours fantasizing or ruminating. It‚Äôs a lot easier said than done, I know...but it‚Äôs possible.

4. Find extroverts to ‚Äúadopt‚Äù you. As hard as it seems, just get one extrovert to like you a little bit. That will cause them to invite you to parties and introduce you to girls, etc. Cling onto these people because they expose you to other people which will aid you in managing your social phobia. It won‚Äôt cure it but you‚Äôll be less hypersensitive. The easiest way have friends is to join an already existing social circle vs trying to do it on your own. 

5. A little confidence goes a long way. People can tell whether or not a man is confident. If you aren‚Äôt confident then you will actually welcome the rejection that you fear. But if you just act confident, people will respect you. Keep your shoulders up, your head high, and keep your voice strong. Even if you‚Äôre a bit awkward, if you‚Äôre confidently awkward, people will still like you. When it comes to confidence, it‚Äôs ok to ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù. 

6. Most importantly, don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. That mistake was trying to fix the symptoms without first addressing the cause and root of the problem. Getting a hot wife, cool friends, nice job,  nice car, etc. is not going to heal your AvPD. It‚Äôll actually make it more frustrating because you‚Äôll have everything you desire, yet you can‚Äôt fully enjoy it.


***DISCLAIMER: this isn‚Äôt medical or therapeutic advice. It‚Äôs just practical advice from my own experience of ‚Äúthugging it out‚Äù thru life with AvDP."
MaladaptiveDreaming,founwg3,t1_fn6hyzl,1588087446.0,It‚Äôs so frustrating. It always feels so awkward when people ask me what shows I watch or am caught up with and I don‚Äôt have an answer. They even give me funny looks when I tell them that I thought a show was great but I just never continued watching it. But the truth was the show was great enough to give me the inspiration I need to MD with...so I didn‚Äôt need to continue watching lol.
AvPD,fomsk5t,t3_g87wmb,1587902346.0,I feel the same exact way but I try not get too comfortable with it. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before they allow us back outside then you‚Äôll be thrown right back into the fire.
AvPD,fol5z6b,t3_evxf5h,1587855545.0,"I have a degree in marketing. I have a corporate job but I‚Äôm barely holding on to it due to my AvPD and Maladaptive Dreaming. I‚Äôm always very distracted and distant at work. I‚Äôve also been in the same position for much longer than the typical employee. This causes management and coworkers to criticize me even more. This makes my life a living hell and I contemplate just quitting and being a hobo frequently. 

But I mostly feel like I just want to divorce my wife, move back in with my parents, quit my job, find a little part-time dead-end gig, and MD my life away. My impulses tell me that that‚Äôs the best decision. But I also love the lifestyle that being high functioning has afforded me. I like my nice house, BMW, and smoking hot wife. I also like the fact that many people see me in real life and Instagram and assume that my life is amazing."
AvPD,fol52pb,t3_f7ohx9,1587855041.0,"That‚Äôs strange. I usually have a huge sigh of relief and excitement once I leave a party that went successfully. But all before and during the event, I will be anxious out of my mind!"
AvPD,fol2jbj,t3_fuc6o0,1587853618.0,Congratulations!! That‚Äôs huge! I‚Äôm so happy for you üòä
MaladaptiveDreaming,fokn9eg,t1_fo4np6p,1587845256.0,Exactly...it literally becomes the soundtrack for the movie that your life is.
AvPD,fokmskj,t3_g74db1,1587845001.0,"I think you need to sit down and have a serious talk with your family. Tell them about AvPD and how serious it is. Get them onboard so they they are all committed to your health. The problem with most people is that they downplay and dismiss mental health issues. They believe that saying that you have a mental illness is just a cop-out from being held accountable for your life. 
But that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. 

Tell them that your AvPD is the reason you can‚Äôt bring yourself to getting a job. Tell them that you desperately want to improve your life but can‚Äôt due to AvPD. Tell them that what you all should be focused on is your treatment/therapy...not your employment status! Getting a job won‚Äôt magically make you better. Take it from me, I have AvPD and I‚Äôve held several jobs...some good and some shitty. My AvPD made each job a living hell! Having to face your boss and coworkers everyday is daunting unless you learn how to manage your symptoms. I‚Äôve straight up quit a good job in the past because my boss harshly criticized my performance. My parents criticized me for being ‚Äúlazy‚Äù but really, my AvPD was triggered at an all-time high every second I was in that office. 

You have to fix your mindset before fixing the individual aspects of your life. If you were to take up a job while suffering from AvPD, it might make your symptoms worse...especially if you get a performance/metric based job. Monthly performance reviews will be the bane of your existence! 

Be encouraged though. Your problem has a solution. Just get the family onboard so you can move towards a solution."
AvPD,fokle59,t1_fojibnp,1587844240.0,"Even if he is an adult, his father does NOT have a point. AvPD affects your ability to socialize...a skill necessary for most jobs. There are varying degrees of AvPD. So while some of us avoidants can hold jobs, others with more severe cases cannot. So you are essentially telling OP that he is valued less because he has AvPD...something he had no control over. If he could just get a job like most people, don‚Äôt you think he would, especially since he‚Äôs very insecure about being unemployed?? Don‚Äôt reinforce the same hurtful things that drove us to this platform in the first place. What you said isn‚Äôt ‚Äútough love‚Äù. For people with AvPD, that just makes it worse. 

(OP, pardon me if you are female. I just used ‚Äúhe‚Äù for convenience)."
AvPD,fokjkhu,t3_g6lxmx,1587843258.0,"I have a group chat with 4 other guys that I‚Äôve been a part of for a few years. My wife is an extrovert so I‚Äôm constantly in contact with her friends as well. Honestly, without that group chat and my wife being a social butterfly, I‚Äôd probably have no social contact at all besides my wife and the weed guy lol."
AvPD,foki5m6,t3_g7y7rj,1587842507.0,"I‚Äôm in the same exact boat. I‚Äôm not formally diagnosed with AvPD but I‚Äôve read enough online articles and books on the subject to know that I have it because I closely relate to all of the symptoms. 

A few months before quarantine, I was making extreme progress with my social phobias. I already had a partial work-from-home job where I was still allowed to come into the office even if I was scheduled to work from home. So I started voluntarily working in the office even though I could‚Äôve stayed home. I was interacting with my co-workers more and even went to a few lunches and happy hours together. I loved the rush that socializing gave me and I felt myself coming alive again. Then COVID-19 hit...so now I‚Äôm forced to work from home everyday. 

Even though quarantine and working from home seem like an introvert‚Äôs dream, it‚Äôs VERY dangerous for people with AvPD or any other type of social phobias. I relate to the amount of comfort and relaxation you are feeling now...I‚Äôm experiencing it. This is literally the PERFECT lifestyle for my avoidant personality and maladaptive daydreaming habit. I‚Äôve felt partially happier and less stressed being home but I feel myself losing all the progress I‚Äôve made. 

While most people can‚Äôt wait for quarantine to finish, I‚Äôm terrified. Having to re-acclimate to being in social environments full of loud critical people seems like a daunting task. I‚Äôve gotten way too comfortable quarantining. I actually don‚Äôt mind my job at all when I‚Äôm working from home. But I literally contemplate quitting everyday that I have to physically go in. 

I‚Äôm also not looking forward to social media after they let everyone back outside. This is because I get triggered by seeing pictures online of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù or coworkers hanging out without me. This is a stark reminder of my social ineptness. I‚Äôm also not looking forward to my wife forcing me to hang out with friends. Even though the socializing is exactly what I want, I have extreme anxiety before having to do it. 

So like you, I‚Äôm torn. I desperately wished life would continue in quarantine, which it won‚Äôt. But I refuse to let AvPD and Maladaptive Daydreaming continue to rob hours, days, weeks, months, and years of my life! I think the main way to overcome social phobias is by exposure and desensitization. The more I socialize is the less anxious and the more confident I feel. But when I‚Äôve gone a long time without seeing people, I‚Äôm much more timid and self-conscious."
AvPD,foi0q4b,t3_g7f6ek,1587776356.0,"It all depends on what they tease me about. If the joke hits one of my triggers, then my mood is done for the day! Typically, I cannot tolerate any joke that I am the butt of. I hate being singled out. And I feel like I‚Äôm an easy target because I‚Äôm quiet. But whenever I do have a comeback, I always take it ‚Äútoo far‚Äù. I respond too emotionally and aggressively. I have no middle. I‚Äôm either quiet as a church mouse or I‚Äôm full of rage."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fo5n9wa,t3_g5teqi,1587529988.0,"I literally feel like my fantasy life is so well put together. I‚Äôm well balanced in all areas of my maladaptive self, but the real me is far behind in every aspect of life. It‚Äôs a tough life to live."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fo5mgca,t3_g4o0tm,1587529349.0,"I used to twirl myself around lol. I would literally sit down in a computer chair and spin myself around vigorously to get my MDs on. Now, I‚Äôm married with a full life (job, kids, mortgage, etc.). I just go running around the block to get my MD‚Äôs off."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fo5lrdq,t1_fo5coqf,1587528818.0,Same thing. I‚Äôm constantly on top of all the new releases because I need a new fix lol.
MaladaptiveDreaming,fo4h87g,t3_g5jpii,1587504373.0,"I do the same exact thing. Without MD‚Äôing, music just seems so pointless."
420,fo2qtyp,t3_fp7k00,1587471703.0,"I can‚Äôt roll to save my life! I used to use a rolling machine but it‚Äôs too much of a hassle. I just buy Raw Cones and stuff em. The process of stuffing cones is pretty satisfying and it‚Äôs still a very quick process. With cones, you can quickly pre-roll a few joints if you‚Äôre on the go."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fo0m4wn,t3_g4zvlh,1587415603.0,"As a slick excuse, you can just say that you don‚Äôt watch TV and movies much because you read more. Most people don‚Äôt read so you don‚Äôt have to worry about them fact-checking you. 

Then just talk about yourself and your feelings. Just form bonds with people based on personality...not common interests. You‚Äôll start to see what other people like and you can just follow suit. 

Life keeps moving forward. Just roll with punches and keep improving your life from here."
weed,fo0c1uz,t3_fwq02z,1587410032.0,"This is my favorite way to smoke now. I can‚Äôt roll for shit so it works out perfectly. And I like the process of stuffing a cone the same way people like the process of rolling up. Pre-rolls are the way to go. If you‚Äôre going to have a long sesh, it‚Äôs always good to have 2-3 joints pre-rolled for uninterrupted smoking."
introvert,fnoomb8,t1_fn2wr0d,1587130382.0,"I did. But now it‚Äôs gone out of hand. It‚Äôs like if she visits on Monday, she doesn‚Äôt see any reason why she can‚Äôt visit Tuesday-Sunday too smh. Plus with the quarantine, she knows that we‚Äôre not busy so she‚Äôs always fixing to come over here smh. And no ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù means nothing to my MIL. She actually view COVID-19 as a reason to spend more time together...ass backwards, I know. But when I mention the faulty thinking, I get ostracized smh."
introvert,fnoo72d,t1_fn8g4ud,1587130108.0,"I wish smh. I just mentioned ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù in passing around her mom and she immediately got defensive. In our culture, even though it‚Äôs a pandemic, it‚Äôs STILL considered rude to purposely distance yourself from your parents. They see it as an insult even though the government is literally telling us to stay apart. 

Her mom basically feels like quarantine is the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù time to spend time together...it‚Äôs such an ass-backwards way of thinking, yet I‚Äôm the bad guy smh. Her defense is that she‚Äôs home all the time and takes all the proper precautions when she does leave the house...therefore it‚Äôs safe to visit us. So COVID-19 is not even a good enough ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to keep her away smh. 

It‚Äôs a complicated predicament that seems like it has no solution...that‚Äôs why I came to Reddit to see what everyone else thought."
introvert,fnoni3d,t1_fn1omsz,1587129663.0,Exactly...and it‚Äôs not mine or my wife‚Äôs responsibility to entertain her at the cost of our privacy!

introvert,fn2wzxp,t1_fn1n7wk,1586606389.0,I‚Äôm already doing that and it sucks. And I hate the fact that I pretty much have to ‚Äúhide‚Äù from my MIL in my own house smh. She simply just needs to stop by less often. But the hard part is conveying that message without being offensive.
introvert,fn2wrtx,t1_fn1o9pz,1586606176.0,"I know right? And I would like to continue to ‚Äúlike‚Äù them...therefore, I need space! Too much of anyone will make you hate em!"
introvert,fn2wo09,t1_fn270ij,1586606072.0,Apparently. She‚Äôs a divorcee. But it‚Äôs still not our responsibility to keep her company.
introvert,fn1e56g,t1_fn1c32h,1586560132.0,"That‚Äôs the same thing I say...but then she‚Äôll also want me to come along. And if I don‚Äôt want to come, I‚Äôll be called ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù again smh. And my mother in law forces her way into my house."
introvert,fn1dzvq,t1_fn1ctzv,1586560048.0,No...we‚Äôre both black. I wish my wife would support me but she‚Äôs completely against me on this one. Her family is different than mine. My family is more reserved over all and we don‚Äôt get into each other‚Äôs business too much. My wife‚Äôs family on the other hand are extremely clingy with one another. That why even her younger sister thinks it ok to just pop up every single day as if we won‚Äôt get tired of her smh

Jcole,flngqbb,t3_fp82kb,1585318236.0,"I felt the same way at first because of the production but then it grew on me...just like ‚Äú4 Your Eyez Only‚Äù. I would say that the production on KOD could‚Äôve used a boost but when you really listen to Cole‚Äôs rapping, he definitely delivered. You have to be in the right frame of mind for it or personally relate to it. 

For example, I related to ‚ÄúPhotograph‚Äù because I legit had an IG crush at the time and that song described my feelings perfectly lol. And there‚Äôs like another 4 songs on KOD that I relate to the same way. 

But KOD was a concept album...so you can‚Äôt expect it to be a bunch of bangers like Born Sinner or 2014 FHD. But I just hope that ‚ÄúThe Fall Off‚Äù sorta ‚Äòmakes up‚Äô for 4 Your Eyez Only and KOD lol. I need it to be 2020 FHD lol!!"

Self-isolation was my main issue in regards to my depression. And the moment I decide to start being more social, the government tells us to practice social distancing lol!
