My ex is from a Muslim family while I'm a non-practising Catholic. I kept this relationship a secret from majority of my family and social circle, except for close ones whom I trust. We aren't religious and more liberal in values. Yet, the family centric value in Asian society is still strong here. Of course, there are interracial and interfaith relationships/marriages working out here for others, just that the sensitive elements of religion as a discussion topic in this country is omnipresent.

If your boyfriend finds worth in having a relationship with you, he will probably need your encouragement and support to stand up against his parents.

When you're so comfortable with feeling like shit, as you do something that makes you feel happier in general, your body somehow reacts as if something harmful is hurting you (with chest aches for me).

""maybe to give you some food for thought, there is an essay he wrote called ""letter on humanism"" that addresses some of the things your brought up. like that first part you mentioned about ""the same field"", he comes pretty close to saying something like that (to him, that ""field"" is Being itself)--

So, the point is that in the determination of the humanity of man as ek-sistence what is essential is not man but Being‚Äî as the dimension of the ecstasis of ek-sistence. However, the dimension is not something spatial in the familiar sense. Rather, everything spiritual and all space-time occur essentially in the dimensionality which Being itself is.""

It's true that, I could think that I'm the best at something, but at the same time, it didn't mean anything if I don't give meaning to it."
Existentialism,f5w6zuj,t1_f5t07lm,1572516039.0,"I love the phrase ""fuck it nothing matters so let's just have fun"" haha it made me smile and laughed a little when I'm feeling a little melancholic from going back to my past memories. Actually there's some truth to it, since we can give meaning however we want, if it means just by having fun living life. *thumbs up*

I'm glad that you're going to start meditation and cut down time online, and hello to my fellow social and political justice warrior! :D"
raisedbynarcissists,f5w6r8l,t3_dpff2t,1572515830.0,"I sometimes do this to my partner in the past when he snores, he laughs loudly or speaks loudly unintentionally or when I'm really in a low mood. Maybe it's a supplementary proof that I was raised by Nparents, but honestly, I'm phasing out from that victimhood mentality because it weighs me down so damn much so I'm in the midst of forgiving and distancing myself from them, particularly my Nmom. Oh well. \*shrugs\* :/"
Anxietyhelp,f5sjly0,t3_dp2r8d,1572433498.0,"I was crying for a second then when you started playing the piano and singing in that comedic way, I'm like laughing gently and cracking a small smile. Thank you for this hilarious satire of our struggle. <3"
sex,f5sjauf,t3_doum0w,1572433123.0,"Maybe sit quietly with your thoughts and find out what may cause this insecurity first, then you can take the next step in finding 'how' to make it exciting and pleasurable for you and your partner. No point in me giving you tips when your insecurities aren't addressed or even worked on because these tips will only work if you're willing to give up your insecurities and allow these to be adopted confidently."
relationships,f5sizu8,t3_doz6qb,1572432737.0,"Firstly, middle ground - discussions between parties involved, if needed, get professional guidance. No need to ruin relationships unnecessarily, and the sense of belonging and self of two young children who have a future ahead of them. As adults, what we do will influence the way young minds see this world and themselves. As much as you have a commitment to your partner beforehand on not having children and you want to do your part to help your mother and sisters, in the end of the day, if your partner still can't see that it's just a temporary measure to aid your mother who is in the midst of recovery, perhaps, follow your heart and think deeply, because your family came into your life prior to our life partner. If your partner of life decides to leave, there is nothing we can do to persuade them to stay or even help them try to understand that, recovery from drug addiction requires patience and empathy from their loved ones, painstakingly slow and long out of love. It's your choice, OP. I understand it's tough, but ... all the best."
Anxiety,f5si7s5,t3_doz3zc,1572431707.0,Me. I've had anxiety attacks in the past as well. Meditation helps me stay grounded and still when my mind is going all over the place.
depression,f5sg0r1,t3_dp0fzg,1572428447.0,"Most importantly, forgive yourself and take your time to grief, if needed, let your emotions out on paper or tears, whatever feels safe for you. We can't control what had happened to us, we can only control how we react and perceive any event. Everything really happens for a reason, my friend. The past can be used to our advantage or our disadvantage, as much as depression weighs heavily on us. What doesn't kill you make you stronger, as cliche as it sounds. My condolences to you and your family. May your mom rest in peace and may you attain resilience and wisdom in the end of it all."

Existentialism,f5sekrc,t3_dp1zrx,1572426088.0,"Acceptance of truth is a good start! I too dealt with this, still probably do. So what I've been doing are meditation, cutting down my time online, watching documentaries of cultures in different parts of the world and past historical events, and even current political/social justice related video/social media posts give me a sense of reality and purpose. I hope this helps you. Cheers."

Existentialism,f2zn7z6,t3_dewynw,1570531170.0,"I have and probably still deal with those existentialism thoughts. For me, meditation helped me staying grounded and realistic. Also, watching documentaries about past events, different cultures and current TV shows helped. Remembering of the things you need to do right now draws my attention to the present moment. Hope this helps."
raisedbynarcissists,f2zn40t,t3_deuglr,1570531022.0,"Well, my dad behaves like that whenever he is around people who are deemed more ""brilliant"", ""knowledgeable"" and ""capable"". \*shrugs\* It's more important to just call them out and then let them be. 

Same thing happened to me. I just needed them to listen because I wanna vent it out to them. \*shrugs\*"
raisedbynarcissists,f2zmv1r,t3_deq6qw,1570530682.0,Yeah you're right. No point trying to persuade them when they refuse to see it. Save your breath and energy for better things. \*double thumbs up\*
worldpolitics,f184c8n,t3_d852js,1569252481.0,"Honestly, they're pushing it too soon before the end of the 99 year agreement, which if I'm not wrong, correct me if required, 2047? My aunts and uncles were almost at a heated debate in the restaurant over this because my cousin's boyfriend is a Hong Kong citizen and even my aunt felt very abhorred by the current political climate there. I too feel the same way on how the HK democracy is being encroached upon so damn soon, not at least the terms being respected to let them have a democracy even if it was part of China back then. 

What scares me so much is that the Chinese government is attempting to silence dissidents with really classic tyrannical means.

Sounds like some are too ""excited"" to ""unite"" for some ""benefits"" :) \*winks\* (Not sure if any undercover government agent is monitoring this, but well, you're offending many many people who are educated from a democratic society."
depression,f182rc0,t3_d80luj,1569251852.0,"petting my cat today was also so soothing and calming - for the lack of better words, and I felt happy"
depression,f0lh1ws,t3_d5f62y,1568717654.0,"[26 F] It hurts for me to feel happy because of this cycle of pain and joy we will forever be dealing with till we die. I'm afraid to truly feel joy and peace. Iit's pointless to feel it wholeheartedly. I even feel guilty to even try and embrace life. It sucks so much when I think about my life and how I was prior to falling into depression.

Besides that, I have also intentionally stopped my prescription halfway without my psychiatrist's knowledge and started doing meditations instead. Somewhat the latter helped, I'm not gonna lie. 

To some people who have not met me in a long time, they see the changes that they can't understand. Why did I lose weight, why does my face look so sunken in, why do I look tired all the time? What do I say? I don't wanna be sympathised for. So I just try and carry my best self out and about, but then drained me so terribly after I get back home. I become a hermit."

Thankfully I've finally got through the first 5 months of my 2019 that was horrendous. Currently, I'm at a place where I acknowledge and accept whatever happened to me in a positive way by seeing it as what is necessary for me to go through in order to be at a better place few months down the road. Since, I am beginning to manage myself better in many more ways. My parents are who they are, and I can't let them control me anymore."
