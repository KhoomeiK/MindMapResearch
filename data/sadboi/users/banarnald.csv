I haven't smoked in 5 days now. Today is day 6. I resonate wholeheartedly with what you say. I've heard of disassociation but never really applied it to myself and reading what you had to say made a little lightbulb go off inside me. I'll talk to my therapist about it when I see him next. It's all related but my problem at the moment is sitting in this sober space. It's the second time I've managed to quit this year. I lasted 6 weeks last time and as much as I hated hearing people say this when I was still deep in the throws of my active addiction, I've found quitting to be the easy part. It's staying sober when the feelings keep on rolling on in that's the hard part. I spent so long numbing those parts of me that now the volume has been turned right back up I don't know how to deal with them. I'm going to therapy, I have one foot in the door of a 12 step program but it's hard to keep going back. I'm not religious and faith seems like a dirty word to me in this frame of mind. I know the answer to my own question is time, therapy and hard work. But as I'm sure we all know, sometimes it feels like an uphill battle that is hard to justify when staying in the warmth of that addiction blanket seems so tempting."

addiction,foy1at2,t3_g9jg6y,1588162781.0,"CHS isn't necessarily about withdrawal. My dad suffered for 20+ years, they used to call it cyclic vomiting and had no idea about it's link to pot. He was told it was probably pancreatitis, hepatitis, I can't even remember what else but a bunch of shit. He'd get sick for two weeks a year like clockwork, hospitalised, high blood pressure, erratic heartbeat, nonstop vomitting, always sweating, literally green in the face. The only thing that made him feel better was hot showers and baths. And I mean so hot a normal persons akin would peel off. They finally suggested the link to his pot smoking and since he slowed down to a few vapes a week he has had no symptoms for about 7 years now. Anyway my point is just to say if your prone to this, it's not just withdrawing from pot that can bring it on but smoking itself. I'm lucky I'm not prone to it, however weed has still ruined my life and I'm currently doing a 12 step program to take control back. 14 years using and this time around I'm a few days clean. I hope you're feeling better, I wish you all of the positivity and strength in your journey and thank you so much for sharing your experience."

GoldCoast,fjytfri,t1_fjxcnhb,1583704212.0,You're welcome! I love sharing the Gold Coast love. Hope you enjoy your adventure when you do make it down. Only a matter of time before the tram has to head down that way!! Lots of busses go to Burleigh though so if you're using public transport you can start at Burleigh instead and do the same trails through to Tally.
GoldCoast,fjxb8n5,t1_fjxal5r,1583665848.0,"[Here is a link to the Burleigh heads national park information page ](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/parks/burleigh-head/about.html), there's a pdf park map of the trails. It's usually easier to park on the southern side of the tallebudgera bridge and walk back across the bridge to the southern trail entrance. I'd follow the trail labelled towards Tumgun lookout which will take you up and over the headland and through the best lookout spots. Don't loop all the way back though, take the stairs on the Burleigh side down towards the northern entrance and down to the beach. The stairs to Burleigh is the stretch that's labelled trail #2 on that map. For the way back Id take the coastal trail to mix it up a bit, trail #1 on the map. It's a flat walk around the headland that keeps you close to the water but still has some good views.  Really you can walk it however you want but to me that's the best way to get to Burleigh and back and see all of the best parts of the walk. 

Sorry if it seems confusing, let me know if you have any questions I'll try and point you in the right direction."
GoldCoast,fjx05ow,t3_ff8sz2,1583650980.0,"Literally anywhere except surfers main beach. If you head north a bit you have Narrowneck which has no shops and Macintosh Island behind it which is a small but cute parkland.. The spit is wide with lots of protected bushland backing it so very natural and big enough to find quiet spots. You won't find any great beaches north of this without getting a boat as the coastline breaks up into Stradbroke islands and Moreton bay at that point and it's all flat and a lot of mangrove areas.. 

I'd recommend heading anywhere south. Just a little bit south you have Broadbeach, around the football club is always fairly quiet, considering its proximity to Surfers. You can go to the rocks around Miami, across the road from the Miami surf club. It's a nice little corner and stays fairly quiet. But if it's natural beauty you're looking for though you should check out Burleigh headland / Tallebudgera creek. I usually park on the tally side and swim in the creek, but you can take the walking trails up the headland and get some awesome views of the coast and come out at Burleigh to swim in the open waves, with heaps of great restaurants. You'll be hard pressed to find that area quiet though, it's a well known gem."

And no, I'm not even close to ready. I don't have a job, which is fine, I'm doing some freelance stuff and my partner earns good money. But I have no passion, and I'm trying my hardest to find it. I can earn good money doing what I normally do, I'm a senior administrator, but I hate it so much. It makes me unbearably miserable. I want kids. But I want kids to come into a situation with two parents who know who they are and what they want out of life, and are happy and comfortable in their own positions. Parents who have the emotional capacity to give them the best childhood experiences possible. I want them to see what life can be like when you spend your days loving what you do, and how rewarding it can be to chase your dreams and passions. And I want them to have a mother who loves herself and has pride and confidence in what she does and who she is. But I have absolutely none of that to give at the moment. Instead I'm working on my own mental health and desperately trying to find my direction before I turn 30. I'm sad and frustrated and it takes me a lot to look in the mirror and love what I see. How can I teach a little human how to love and respect themselves if I can't do it for me.

I'm so sorry little baby, if you are inside me, I can't give you the life you deserve and it kills me."
AskWomen,fi9sfoc,t3_f6ugtu,1582280034.0,"I had a job where the company was going through involuntary administration and they had fired the whole administration and accounts departments except for the accounts manager. He hired me and it was up to us to navigate the involuntary administration period and then restructure. It started out good, I had a lot of freedom, control and trust from him. It started getting weird when other colleagues (the field team) started asking what I thought of my boss. Yeah he was okay, why? Oh no reason *wink*. Said boss started asking me if I wanted to catch up over weekends doing really casual stuff, playing cricket, drinks with groups of friends etc. I politely explained I had a partner and I'd ask if he was interested but whenever I bought him up the conversation would fizzle and he wouldn't continue to ask if I wanted to join. One Friday he said a whole bunch of work people were going for dinner, did I want to join? I'd been there for about six weeks by then and had never participated in any work social events so I thought well if everyone is going to be there it might be good to break the ice with some of the field staff. So I go to said restaurant and it's a super quiet romantic style restaurant where the only people at the table was the boss, and a married couple who both worked in the field team. It was so obviously set up to be a kind of date that it was just an hour long cringe session until I could make an excuse to leave. From there things just accelerated towards in appropriate. I should note here that due to the current structure of the company there was no HR and no one else I could talk to about feeling slightly harassed by my boss, the only other person I could have taken the issue to was a man who was appointed to oversee us from the administrators organisation. Anyway, there were so many little instances but there are two that really made me make my mind up. He had to go home to Pakistan and had me drop him off and pick him up from the airport. When he left I was helping him get the backs from the car and he hugged me. Out of nowhere. I didn't hug back, it was just awkward. When he got back he gave me a present. I shit you not, he bought me a Sari that he actually told me would work well as a wedding Sari?? I know nothing about Pakistani culture but it was just weird. Finally, a few days after he returned he came out to where I was working, asked what I was working on and proceeded to rub my shoulders and neck in a weirdly sensual way. I had told him so many times I had a partner and had tried to nicely and probably too subtly say I wasn't interested. But I was 20 and just didn't know how to deal. I had no management support or even anyone else in the office to talk to except my harrasser. It was just too much. So I packed my desk, put it all in a box, left me work phone and keys in the top draw and left. I was waiting for him to ask why I had all of my things, but he was just oblivious. He thought I'd gone to lunch and I just never came back. He tried to call me like 50 times on my personal number once he found the work phone and note, but I just couldn't deal. I was so uncomfortable and felt so trapped for weeks so walking out that door was just the most satisfying thing I'd ever done. Never looked back."

AskReddit,fhfo4hb,t3_f2z9dd,1581547454.0,"Australian here. My dad almost died from cancer and complications from two major surgeries as a result of the cancer. As soon as it was found he was operated on. No wait time. He spent weeks in ICU with not a cent out of pocket for anything, including the years and years of follow up appointments and specialists. If it wasn't for our healthcare system my dad would probably be dead and my whole family would be bankrupt from the efforts of trying to keep him alive. Instead, during that same time I was studying my bachelor of science and education double degree without any out of pocket expenses on an interest free loan I only pay back start to pay back once I earn over $45,000 per year. 

In regards to wait times for family doctors, we have so many clinics in my area I'm amazed if I can't be seen within 24 hours of calling for an appointment. Some specialists might take longer but for example I got a skin cancer cut out of my nose last week. The appointment tool two weeks and I've had three follow up sessions to check the healing process. No out of pocket expenses at all.

In terms of how it affects my paycheck, yeah taxes suck, but I'd pay every single cent I have to keep my dad alive, and to know if get the same care if it were ever me. So yeah, in my opinion the ~20% taxes I pay are abso-tootin-lutely worth it.

You'll get a job you love doing, you'll meet people with similar interests that see the value in you, you'll travel, you'll learn that the cliques and groups at school are not even a close resemblance of how adults act. And you'll come out of it stronger and wiser than most because for you it was a struggle. I'm not saying it's fair. It's not. It's fucked. But trust me, life gets better.

I tried to cut my wrists when I was 15 for a lot of the same reasons you mentioned. I was teased relentlessly and started valuing myself only as much as my bullies did. I was a piece of shit so why would I even let the world suffer another day of my existence. But you know today I woke up to the love of my life kissing my cheek and telling me how beautiful I am. I have a small circle of friends that are just the most amazing people I could have hoped to meet - all of us bullied misfits. I get to travel and experience different food and cultures and people and places, all of them exciting and eye opening and beautiful. I have a dog that worships the ground I walk on, an apartment I love near the beach and a life I wouldn't give up for the world.

Please hold on, there are so many people who love you, but most importantly if you give yourself time you will learn to love yourself. Trust me.

I've also found setting myself up to make the next day easier helps too. I slept all day yesterday, it's been a long week of emotions. I knew I wasn't going to get anything done so the only goal I set myself yesterday was to write a checklist for today, so when I wake up I can refer straight to the list without having to stress myself thinking about all of the things I could/should be doing. Just pick one and get on with it. So far I've done this dishes, cleaned out my wardrobe & refolded my mess of clothes, and contacted the real estate about a leaky tap. There's more on my list but just having done those three things is enough for today and I feel so much better about myself.

I try and keep the mantra in my head that the only person I have to be better than today is who I was yesterday. So with that logic today was a total win. Remember not to overdo you're own expectations, and to be kind to yourself. I'm going to put on my favourite album and drink a hot chocolate to congratulate myself."

I have debt for a bachelor degree I never even finished, three years of study paid for with no interest and these loans paid back via my taxes whenever I reach around $50k per annum. My partner is from Canada so paid for his master's education but managed to do it with no student loan debt, THAT is a big props to his family, I know. However he's a teacher (basic high school maths teacher who has worked through a few promotions) on almost $100k per annum and I work a lowly desk job for $45k, technically uneducated. We pay less than 25% of our income on rent and will carry this same rate over to our mortgage, however we live in a very expensive and touristy city about one block back from world famous beaches. We chose expensive living. Internet, electricity, food etc, maybe equates to another 20% all together. We have no debt. The rest is technically expendable, we save a lot. 

Fair enough this isn't the norm because people here are sold the credit dream, bigger car, bigger house, bigger stereo, whatever the fuck you want the banks will finance and trap you in their web.

IsItBullshit,fdetzic,t1_fddxmrh,1578346563.0,"We live on one of the most resource rich ""islands"" in the world. It's a whole continent and it spans many climate areas, we are literally almost as big as all 50+ states. We grow everything ourselves, we have our own mining resources, we really are one of the most self sufficient countries/islands/continents in the world. Or at least we have the ability to be, we still buy everything from China. Just like you guys. 

Another thing I want to point out, this isn't directed at you but I can't be bothered responding to the other 75 comments individually... Cost of living doesn't not fluctuate with exchange rates. Y'all are going on about how our dollar is worth about 75% of yours. But in 2013 it averaged $1.06aud to $1usd, and guess what, cost of living and incomes were the same as they always have been in both countries. Please take that out of the equation, it means nothing. Our cost of living is higher, yes, but it's not proportional to how much higher our minimum wage is compared to the US."
IsItBullshit,fdbjbxq,t1_fdbhfgb,1578257893.0,"We know it's bad there for you guys but to be honest, $15 an hour with no PTO has me shooketh. Minimum wage here is $20. I used to make over $30 an hour on Sundays scrubbing toilets thanks to penalty rates. And we have our fair share of poverty stricken working families even on those rates. Cost of living is much higher too I guess. But wow."

Wellthatsucks,fcwn0nm,t1_fcvxcm7,1578030275.0,"My dog did something similar, but at the last minute he changed his mind.

He'd been loved every second of his life for 14 years but was just fading away. We tried to just keep him happy and comfortable but even that was an effort and he had lost control of his bowels so there was so much care needed to keep him clean and comfortable. We had an appointment to have him put down and the night before it was booked he got up from his deathbed and disappeared. I was so distraught that he wouldd die alone, and it was raining and miserable outside, so I had a bunch of ladies from the neighbourhood and I searching for him and calling his name for two days. On the evening of the second day I went out at last light to have one last look for him, was calling his name and out of the bushes he reemerged. Tired and wet and skinny and still just as sick. I took him inside, dried him off and laid with him. His breathing laboured within the hour and he passed in my arms with his paw in my hand. 

I felt so lucky he came home and spent those last few moments warm and comfortable and with me and my parents, the three people who loved him the most. 

RIP Butchy. Still hurts, but he was the best mate I could have asked for."

ADHD,f9e2mt5,t1_f9dmdcd,1575239117.0,"I hope you're keeping your chin up. This is all new to me too and I have literally no resources to share. In true ADHD fashion I projected my emotions, distracted myself and now I'm okay. But I'm learning to use my spurts of mental clarity to work on myself instead of just continuing to ignore it.  I'm on my way to the local library today to find some books for ADHD.  I hope you're feeling better today where ever in the world you are.

And my partner tells me this all the time so I want to tell you. He says he doesn't spend time in my head analysing me with the same ferocity I do myself. What he sees is someone trying to do better, falling down, needing support but ultimately getting back up and keeping on going. What he fell in love with wasn't my ADHD, it was the person I am with it. It may be a downer sometimes but it also makes me captain empathy, going the extra step to help people because I literally feel everything. It makes me funny and quick witted, it makes me a little bit quirky and I march to the beat of my own drummer. And these things are what he loves. And he can take the down days knowing who I am underneath it all. Your husband chose to spend his life with you for a reason, and I'm sure he loves you for you ADHD in so many ways, not just in spite of it."
ADHD,f9e04q8,t1_f9dw97k,1575238465.0,"Your comment made me ugly cry and laugh at the same time. So thanks.

I'm new to the meds and the diagnosis but I have a history of amphetamine abuse from about 7-8 years ago so I've been avoiding the full dose or consistently taking them most days to be honest. I worked hard to live a stimulant free life back then that it's another one of life's cruel jokes that the ""cure"" is just another demon I have to battle.  I appreciate your response, it does put a lot of perspective into the meds and the emotional rollercoaster I've been on since starting them. Maybe they just aren't for me. I see my psych tomorrow so I will chat with him about it all. 

I'm not going to give up, I just get frustrated that I have to put in so much more effort than non-ADHDers, which I guess is the main frustration for all of us. This forum feeds me so much strength though. It's easier to fight the good fight when you aren't doing it alone. Thank you. 

Sloth out."
ADHD,f85yyrk,t3_crycw2,1574286276.0,"This is me. Super high IQ. Got put up a year in school, aced the actual work without trying, only reason I didn't get good grades is because I took too many days off or wouldn't hand in drafts, just final copies. Thought it was the school holding me back. Stupid rules etc etc. I'll be fine in the real world. I'm smart.

Finished school, crashed, burned.

Spent 10 years in psychologists offices for anxiety treatment. Never finished University, never held a job longer than a year or two, averaging 6 months mostly. Plagued with financial instability and self loathing. 

Got diagnosed a few weeks ago, I'm looking forward to being able to try to put my life back together again."

I have to agree with the rest of the comments though, hope island is a bit far removed and quiet compared to the main parts of the Goldy. If you're here for a big weekend. I'd say predrinks at the boardy and then head on in to surfers or Broadbeach."

They're not even giving a chance for other movies do well because there are literally no other movies coming out.

GoldCoast,et7tpcj,t1_et6fiqw,1562537955.0,"Nerang is great! Abundance of shopping centres and it's own cinema but nothing as busy as the Robina town centre so easy parking and no traffic. Everywhere is close to the highway, you can find awesome properties backing onto some beautiful hinterland spots or up on the hills for some magic views of the surfers skyline, and relatively cheap by Gold Coast standards. There are areas to stay away from, like around the cemetery and velodrome, but I'd take Nerang over Robina hands down any day. 

That being said, I live in Broadbeach and god damn it's a good spot. Walking distance to all of the pubs, restaurants, shops & beaches, and there are still some awesome quiet spots in the beachside pocket between south surfers and the Oasis. Not as much for places with a yard but lots of my neighbours have dogs and just take them for beach walkies before and after the flags are up, or in the off leash sections of the parks along the beaches."

One year the baby fell out of the nest, so dad and I put it in a plastic planter pot we fashioned into a makeshift nest and ziptied the pot back up onto one of the branches. For the rest of the parent magpies lives they would never swoop me or dad, but would still swoop viciously at everyone else.

I don't blame her, but my mum wears the guilt anyway and that just makes me feel worse for not being normal. She did her best, she thought it was the best for me. I just try and hide my anxiety from her now and have decided I'm resolute in not having children.

One of the biggest things is using the DPNs I think. I saw lots of people talking about doing it on circulars, which I was, but it makes the increase messy in the spots where you rotate the needles.
