So, I started casually dating my new “FWB” and I feel very little romantically for him. Difference? He’s a dude, a sweet, nice, honest guy, don’t get me wrong - but he’s not someone I am going to romanticize into this larger than life idea. He doesn’t personify the things I want for myself. I’m not at risk of painting him as “the one.”

How do you get her to see you’re not her enemy? Stop enabling her. Every times you apologize for her abuse, you’re absolving her from fault and putting yourself in the hot seat. 

You both need serious therapy. She’s abusive and unwilling to do any reflection. You’re being manipulated. Call a domestic abuse hotline, **now.**

Tomorrow, get a regular therapist, go to those appointments, and work on yourself. You’ve got to get a grasp on reality: the way the **both** of you are behaving is very unhealthy.

I have been in therapy for over a decade. I didn’t decide to take it seriously until the past year - the decision was in result to a detonation of my personal life. I think pwBPD usually seek help when they’ve hit a wall - like losing a career, a partner, friends, or family due to their illness. I read a lot about people being given ultimatums by family or SO’s, then seeking help. Or after suicidal ideation/attempts.

What makes you anxious to go to therapy?"
BPD,fpisaig,t1_fpipq8o,1588647586.0,"Gotcha.
 
I have BPD and it sucks - it’s painful, its hard, and it’s even been catastrophic to my life.

General advice without lens: be patient with the pwBPD. Create safe spaces for communication. Take care of your own mental health and safety. Both of you should absolutely 100% retain a relationship with therapists individually - a couples therapist is also super helpful.

I can’t overcome the symptoms associated with BPD if I’m not serious about my mental illness and treatment. For me that means: therapy + CBT + sobriety. It sounds like your partner doesn’t want treatment. 

To one of your original points, yes, you’re right. You can’t help someone who doesn’t see a problem nor wants to help themselves."

Does she still want to work it out?"
BPD,fpik8nc,t3_gdnl3c,1588642640.0,"I commend you for your effort. You seem to be invested in your relationship and it’s very inspiring. The fact that you educated and continue to educate yourself is awesome.

From what I gather, you both want to be together, you’re willing to do a lot of work, but your partner doesn’t want to go to therapy, right? If she’s been diagnosed and you’ve done the research, you both know the top treatments for this illness revolve around psychotherapy. Maybe everyone doesn’t need therapy and can do DBT/ACT solo, but if it’s so bad it’s therapy or lose my obviously invested partner? You can bet your last dollar I’m getting in that head camp.

99% of the time ultimatums are shit, but sometimes by not sticking up for yourself, more damage can occur. You become codependent and hurt/lose yourself, and your partner stays in the same destructive cycle.

Its hard, but I try and remind myself of all the tough times I’ve been through before because I came out stronger and with a better set of tools to handle the future. Obviously, I’m still working, but every setback means becoming aware of a “fault” and figuring out how to become a better person. 

Even harder for me as I’ve become suicidal when catastrophizing, is actively deciding I’m going to work on things instead of wallow in the “what if’s” or romanticized fictional future."

However, I’ve recently pivoted from focusing on the title of my diagnosis and more on the symptoms. I meet a significant of the amount of criteria for BPD, but my long term doctor emphasizes that it’s about treating the symptoms. 

For example, DBT is not just for BPD folks - it’s for people who struggle with topics like mindfulness or coping skills. When I do DBT, I’m trying to manage my emotions better, not eradicate a diagnosis.

I decided to call the cops. It turned to physical abuse. Then CPS. It turned my life upside down.

It changed my relationship with my parents, I had to be removed from their home. Luckily my grandparents were a registered “safe” foster home. I stayed with them, it caused a huge ruckus, changed all of our lives.

I hope you understand I’m not belittling your experience or emotions, because you feeling the way you do is totally valid and make sense.

For the sake of preserving the relationship, respect his boundaries. There’s a feeling of abandonment, and you’ve identified it. That’s the first step. Next: how are you going to react to it? Are you going to give into impulse & seek out his assurance against his wishes? Or can you control that impulse? 

If you can control the reactionary impulse, you’ll not only strengthen your relationship, you’ll be building coping skills that are going to make **you** a better person.

For me, the most rad feeling is **doing something I can be proud of.** If you can use your coping skills and give him space successfully, it’s going to be hard, but it’s going to be so rewarding in so many ways.

You’ve got friends, great. Ahead of the curve. Anytime you want to text him, text them. Call someone in your support system / therapist if you feel yourself going into a place you don’t feel you can control. If you’ve got hobbies, do ‘em. Go for a bike ride. Use coping skills man, you got this!"

I looked around at the (metaphorical) pile of shit I was sitting in and was like, “okay... I’ve been here before, something in my life isn’t working.”

I had no choice but to stop. Another AA thing that I believe is applicable to people who don’t take their mental illness seriously is, “you know you’ve hit rock bottom when you stop digging.” 

I wasn’t taking my mental health seriously and it was ruining my relationships. I had to take accountability for myself and my actions. Booze blurred lines, I acted a fool, forgot things, drove drunk, spent my last few bucks on booze.

I understand that picking up the bottle seems like the “easier” thing to do, but for me, picking up the pieces of my drunken existence was much more difficult than learning to move through negative feelings. 

Im sorry your partner was dismissive, and it probably feels like what’s the point - but dude, you’ve got a whole entire life of your own. If you don’t want to live a certain way, make a change. Nobody is going to hold you accountable but yourself.

I don’t mean to be rude. I am keeping it 100. And maybe you haven’t gotten to the low point I was at, but ask yourself if you can see any of these things in your future and if it’s what you want for yourself."

copywriting,fnvptrd,t1_fnv7tqn,1587301478.0,"Thanks.

I have more materials to compliment this project. I’ve currently one other print ad, an app mockup, and a bus shelter ad. I’d like to create a brochure, too.

I’m using moderncopywriter.com to look up portfolios and imitating their bodies of work with my own ideas. The portfolios I’m choosing belong to folks who have gotten into agencies I’d love to work for.

Is this a good strategy?"

It’s a challenge at first, but your stomach will shrink and your portions will have to accommodate said size reduction. It’s a challenge and maybe a long term goal, because without stability it’s not sustainable.

I’ve been an emotional eater my whole life. I feel sad, eat. happy? eat. excited? eat. angry? eat. 

recently I started approaching food differently. i do v e r y simple things that have helped me lose 15 lbs (I’m 27, 5’4, ~150 lbs). 
1) I stopped drinking and OMG - not only is my head more clear and I’m less depressed, but it’s rid my diet of empty calories (and I’m not drunkenly eating Taco Bell 3 nights a week).
2) when I cut out booze, I started craving sugar. so I fell in love with fruit! i start my day with an orange. if I’m real hungry, Greek yogurt + berries + granola is the jaaaaaammmm.
3) salads are kind of awesome. part of the reason my diet was so bad was because of inconvenience: fast food / pre packaged stuff is easier. I started figuring out easy ways to make cheap/nutritious meals. i like taking kale, roasting half and makin lil kale chips, then massaging raw kale with a ton of lemon juice, add some cheese and oooooo man, delish!
4) i don’t tell myself I can’t have anything. if I’m at my grandpas house and he makes big, fatty, carb-y roast beef sandwiches smothered in gravy, I’m having one! but im eating slow and stopping when I’m full. im enjoying the bites I do take, and then I don’t feel cheated when i only finish half. (And my tummy feels so much better than when I’d over eat.)
5) lastly, I take it one. day. at. a. time. I know I’m happy with the success I’ve had, but I want to lose more weight and become stronger. I had a cupcake last night at 1 am, and instead of beating myself up about it today. i had a healthy breakfast, drank tons of water, went on a long walk, and had a size appropriate dinner. bam. back on it, ready to take tomorrow on.

good luck and im here to chat if you’d like some more ideas!!"

AdultChildren,fna4b9f,t3_g0dhmp,1586790764.0,"My step dad was a narcissistic asshole. My mom and him got together when I was 2 or 3, and even my earliest memories of him involve drugs our booze.

Anytime we were going anywhere, he’d grab a few beers, get behind the wheel, crack one open and put the rest in the center counsel. And on the way to our destination, we’d stop at the county line liquor store (our state used to have tight regulations on alcohol sales) and he’d grab a 12 rack for the ride home. Usually my mom sat shotgun, she said nothing. It was normal for us.

At around age 11, we moved into a bigger house. We weren’t rich, but my step dad was a particularly high functioning alcoholic with a good job. Our house became the party house, and I mean, 7 nights a week music blaring, hard liquor, beer, weed, a little coke. They usually partied in the garage under my bedroom.

My parents friends would get too loaded to drive, often passing out on the couch or in a spare bedroom. On my way out of the house for school, I’d frequently see random people in my house. Sometimes the men would drunkenly slur in my face, give me unwarranted hugs, ask me to sit with them and talk. It was so uncomfortable, to sit and watch this red faced, slurred speech adult with almost completely diminished motor functions try to talk to me. Again, all normalized.

There was a point where things got significantly worse. The parties lasted longer, the neighbors hated us, my neighborhood friends wouldn’t talk to me on the bus. One night, I was so tired of the noise, so tired of the drinking, the scary high strangers, their hugs, and big red faces I asked my mom to send the guests home, begged and pleaded. She shrugged me off and sent me to my room. I went into my room, dialed *67911, and told the dispatcher that I wanted to file a complaint on my neighbors for having such loud parties all the time. They said okay, little did I know what was going to happen.

About ten minutes later, I hear the music below me rip silence - like in the movies where the record scratches and it’s dead quiet. A few moments later, my step dad slams my bedroom door open, grabs me by the arm, pushes me down the stairs and pulls me in front of all of his friends to talk to the officer. The cop tells me I can’t waste his time to call in a complaint on my parents. My step dad orders my back in my room. I think this is the first time I experienced severe anxiety, because a few minutes later my door swings open again, and he’s irate. He verbally destroyed me, calling me and embarrassment and an idiot, smashed my head into a wall, ripped all of my clothes out of my closet, he just completely trashed my room and threw whatever objects he could drunkenly aim enough to hit me.

My parents were “so embarrassed,” and my mother still brings it up to this day (I’m 27). I’m still to blame, she still can’t believe I did that. Maybe I shouldn’t have, but I felt so tired, afraid and defeated. I was paranoid and my folks didn’t listen when I asked, so I thought the cops would calm them down. Boy, was I so, so wrong.

A few years later, my step dad’s functioning alcoholism turned nonfunctional. He kept losing jobs, burning bridges, it was a rotational door of new friends in and out. He became super depressed and got into coke, which made him paranoid. He’d stash knives in furniture. Forget where he put guns. Sometimes my friends would find knives tucked in the couch and I’d have to laugh it off, really knowing it was because my step dad was so paranoid he sat in the living room, knife in hand, staring at the front door until he knocked out.

I moved out when I turned 16, was estranged from my parents for a few years until my mom left my step dad. Even though she left him, she still feels I was wrong to leave."

graphic_design,fn6oj2x,t1_fn6mg8b,1586704113.0,"Your reasoning for the dark background makes perfect sense. Dark can mean a lot of things, though. Play with it. Maybe black will end up being the best solution, but you won’t know until you try others. 🙂

I love New Orleans. My favorite wine bar used to be Bacchanal. Bacchus was the Roman god of wine. But if I was in New Orleans & I saw a poster with a head of a classical Greek looking sculpture with solely the word “drink” on it, I would be like, huh?  What are you selling me here? 

I’m haven’t spent time in DC, so I’m not the best authority on it. Is there a “hip, young” neighborhood in DC that has these tiki/niche bars? Maybe it’s about advertising the neighborhood? Or if you can be more specific with the assignment, create an advertisement for an individual tiki bar? 

For rock, is there a music venue you like? Or, is there a local band that you can make a poster for?"
graphic_design,fn6jwzp,t3_fzshjo,1586701157.0,"I think there are some really great design skills applied here. For example. The texture on the microphone and the detail of the shadows all look lovely. Tiki dude also shows great detail and shadowing. I also like the typography choices on the “ROCK” poster. 

I am struggling with the concepts. I don’t think you necessarily have to trash these, but they need a serious overhaul. Anytime you execute a concept, even if it’s not the strongest, use it as a learning experience. That’s what is so awesome about school: you’re there to experiment. Some people on this thread must be forgetting that you’re a student and need constructive criticism.

Start with the copy: what exactly are you trying to say? How can I clearly communicate it? Like, maybe for the tiki guy, “Tiki bars are hot. DC brings the island to you,” and a call to action (bud light has an awesome CTA; “party responsibly.”) from there, think of some new concepts, definitely lose the dark background. Sketch a few new concepts out, run them by classmates or post here, and then execute the strongest. You got it. 

Also, possibly unrelated side note, maybe it’s because I’m sober, but I’m an alcoholic and seeing DRINK like that makes me feel like I’m being forced to drink, like, shitty cheap rum."

Originally I misread the end of your comment and thought it said “find something special to celebrate each and every birthday,” (maybe that’s what I needed to see, thanks wet brain!). That sounds kind of lovely. Before being sober, I never ate sweets; no cake or pie, wouldn’t even finish a few scoops of ice cream. Now I’m the friggin’ cake boss- maybe I celebrate with a really fabulous cake or pie every year and make it a tradition... it’s got me thinking.

I’m not saying this to hurt you, but someone said this to me, and it’s really helped with introspection: “you don’t turn angry, you are angry.”

The aggression/anger you’re feeling is there even when you’re not drunk. But it’s a secondary emotion, meaning there’s some sort of serious anxiety/depression/etc. that you have to address. That means, focus on you right now. Feel those feels over the next few weeks. A few months in, you’re going to be so clear headed and both you and your husband are going to friggin’ love it. 

(I am giving you this advice because I didn’t follow it and lost my partner.)"
stopdrinking,fn5qc5z,t3_fzkh2q,1586672329.0,"It gets SOO much better.

The first couple weeks/month can be filled with anger and anxiety... for me, a lot of shame, too.

But then, as you spend more time with these emotions, they’re not as scary. They don’t have the same strength they did a few weeks ago. Someone else said your emotions are “fusing” with you, and I think that’s a good way to put it.

Acknowledging these emotions, identifying them, and getting through them was so new to me. I remember describing it, “like using a muscle I never knew I had.”

It DOES get better. And as much as this next month drags on and seems unbearable, think about how much time you wasted being drunk. This next month is nothing compared to the rest of your new life. You got this."
