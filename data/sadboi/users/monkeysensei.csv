\*Note to mods my intention is not to promote but to inform people that there are options out there\*

I  work as a self-employed food courier for one of the major US food courier companies. I have 10 years of delivery experience and near 2  years of self-employed courier work with this company. Right now if you have a vehicle and a (not horrible) criminal/traffic record I can provide advice and tips on how to join the ranks of a food courier. My intention is for people to attain temporary income if they have lost their job due to the pandemic.

Registered food couriers are immune to any lockdown because they are considered  'critical transportation employees' as long as they are doing business.  To be honest there is a risk with the occupation. You interact with  50-100 people a day but I carry a bottle of hand sanitizer in the car and you can invest in masks or gloves to keep you protected. Currently, I  make more than enough to survive due to everyone ordering delivery these days.

Msg me or post here for advice on how to get started, I am not doing this for any reference payout, but rather to inform people that there are other options in this crisis for income."
