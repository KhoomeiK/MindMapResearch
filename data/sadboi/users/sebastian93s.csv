BPD,fjpmqzt,t3_feiih5,1583555045.0,These last 2 years I have failed in my relation ship hardcore! Been together 7 years married 3 and I love her so much. But these last 2 years I've been very destructive to our relationship. Very narcissistic I start lieing alot and covering up with more lies. Started drinking and had and affair once. Then fought my self talking to another girl just because I was enjoying the thrill. I just seemed out for help 3 weeks ago and hoping it all helps. I know the feeling mam wish you luck!

bipolar,fhjnk7q,t3_f03crv,1581650646.0,I just went through an episode. I'm married  and been with her for 7 years now. I let impulses overtake me knowing I was in the wrong but couldn't stop my self my inner voice telling me I was at wrong but just couldn't grasp it. I got caught up talking to a girl from work never touched her though. And started drinking heavily and tried to find drugs to numb the mind as I was doing all this. I swear I see a pattern here with me seems almost every 6 months for the last 2 years it's gotten bad. I did this one other time couple years ago. And other times was just allloooottt of porn like pornhub and watching cams... this time around though I got really really depressed at the end of it like suicidal thoughts...still there but has eased down a bit I seaked out for help and got my med appointment Monday! Hope things change for the better
