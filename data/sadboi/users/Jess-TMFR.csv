traumaticchildhood,fqy3xaj,t1_fpllecm,1589742182.0,"Your family loves the guilt/shame route, huh? Been there. 

I think this is a losing situation with them. I don't know how you would begin to repair this relationship or your own mental health with them in the picture. 

I don't think they are accountable or enlightened enough to take steps in the right direction, and I'd hate for you to be dragged down by a lifetime of this behavior. 

You don't need to feel bad for leaving, just know that it's the right thing for you. Your door can remained cracked, in case they ever seek professional help and want to make amends... but don't let them pull you under anymore. 

Sometimes, it's best to let people go. You can't help everyone and you don't ""owe"" people anything other than kindness and respect."
Anxiety,fqy3di9,t1_fpmus7a,1589741930.0,"Sure! Sorry for the delay, I missed this somehow! 

I worked for Lionbridge, which is fairly large and offers a lot of different positions. They paid about $15 an hour for search engine rating.  

Talent Inc is the company behind Top Resume. I worked for them for a while as a professional resume writer/linked in editor. You're paid by the project, so the ease of the job just depends if you get a good client or not. But the pay is decent and they offer a lot of bonuses!

Otherwise, sign up for Rat Race Rebellion and Flexjobs. They find the remote positions for you. I think that's where I found both of the above mentioned positions!"

Also, writing. Sounds like you're having stress overload so your brain just won't focus on the tasks ahead. If you can write stream-of-consciousness to get some of the junk out (dig deep), that might help to free up some space. Also, ask yourself questions like ""why"" you're focusing on this other thought. While you're at it, start writing gently with pen and paper about the topics of your assignments. Once you're headed on the right direction with less pressure on yourself, the path might become effortless. 

If that all fails, go for some long fucking walks. Allow time for your brain wander while you're moving your body, like a semi-meditative state. Make a deal with yourself, when you get back in your chair (1-2 hours later, I'd recommend), your focus is getting back to work. Repeat as needed.

Good luck! I feel the frustration."

Anxiety,foy3ojz,t3_ga5q2t,1588164544.0,"Whatever progress you're making, you need to slow down and give yourself credit. It might be moving at a crawl, but that's better than standing still. Drawing a line a day still makes a picture. 

Putting any effort towards making life changes is difficult and honorable. Getting up every day and TRYING to work on yourself is more brave than most. Be more proud of yourself. 

It's easy to feel like you're stuck and there's no hope for change, but you know that isn't reality. That's your inner voice spitting some trauma talk. 

You aren't trapped. You aren't doomed with this life/struggle. Change is possible. You will get through it, just like you've gotten through so many other things. 

Once you get some traction, acknowledge your hard efforts to yourself, and sit down to *feel* the pride/satisfaction/relief... you'll find the inertia to move forward. Journal, dude. Write down what you're doing every day and pat yourself on the back. Note how you feel when you're on the right path versus slipping backwards. And be kind to yourself. 

If you're still struggling with ""burn it all down"" moments, I would guess that you're not dealing with something(s) subconsciously bothering you.

I totally understand the fear of giving up a paycheck. But at a certain point, if you aren't able to enjoy the things your current work allows you to have, anyways... what's the point? Maybe work out the ACTUAL worst case scenarios for leaving, and decide if it's worth your mental distress staying there."
traumaticchildhood,fovgdqd,t3_g0yyve,1588100864.0,"Hi, great fucking post.

I would really like to repost this on my blog where I take user contributions. You show incredible insight and self-determination. This is exactly the spirit of my project, and I'd love to feature anything you'd like to pen, if you have more to get out.

If you'd like to check it out first, I'm at  [https://www.t-mfrs.com/](https://www.t-mfrs.com/)  (that abbreviation is Traumatized Motherfuckers, own it loud and proud). My contact info is on the site, feel free to reach out.

Your post filled me with pride. You're strong and brave, and truly insightful. When it comes to recovering from traumatized families and slowly unraveling the web of neglect/abuse, you aren't alone or ""wrong."" 

Can I share your words?"
traumaticchildhood,foveqmk,t3_g19qsj,1588100082.0,"I'm so, so sorry. You are in a family of very sick people. Know that this is common among traumatized families, and you haven't done anything wrong. Families often choose a scapegoat to pile their own trauma onto, almost like they've agreed to sacrifice one lamb. Usually, it's a downstream effect; the father hits the boy who punches the dog. In my family, father terrorized the boys who terrorized the younger girl (me) and he fully encouraged them to unite against me for as long as I can remember (""your mom only loves your sister"" and the like). My oldest brother still resents me, denies everything that happened growing up, and tells me I have no reason to experience anxiety/depression. 

My therapist says this gang mentality is especially normal when one person has something different about them - an inner light, motivation to live a better life, a curiosity about mental health. That's a challenge to the collective agreement they've made, they must crush what they don't have. 

Unfortunately, it seems like unwell folks tend to want everyone to feel the same way. They don't want their idea of ""normal"" to be challenged - so, say, admitting that you were sexually abused or suffer from mental health problems would actually confirm that they had unresolved issues and culpability. It's easier to say that ""everyone goes through this"" and make you the weirdo. One of my best friends suffered horrific sexual abuse at the hands of her family, and 35 years later her mom still maintains that it's just part of growing up and she should stop rocking the boat. They collectively ostracize her every chance they get, and insist that she's trying to start trouble for setting any boundaries. Seems like a family of ignorant, traumatized fools, right? Right. 

SO, you aren't wrong and this isn't your fault. But you should see a professional and talk about the options for distancing yourself from your family. If they aren't willing to work on themselves, you don't need their abuse in your life. 

Feeling like a hated outsider is horrific, and mental illness group think is contagious. Take care of yourself and cut the fat. Reach out if you ever need anything."
traumaticchildhood,fovb8jc,t3_g5azjn,1588098421.0,"Sorry you went through this. You aren't wrong for feeling strange and confused about what happened, or doubting if it's real. Considering your physical response when you think back on it, I would guess that it isn't a completely false memory. The details could be different, but your body remembers something like this occurring. 

Do you talk to anyone professionally? A therapist can help guide you through this experience to finally process the trauma. You might find some relief. 

Side note: I have to wonder if your cousin was being abused, or where she learned this behavior herself. Kids are just mimics; it's disturbing and maybe strangely reassuring to realize that she probably wasn't getting gratification from this herself, so much as repeating ""games"" she learned. Not sure how close your family is, but... worth wondering about."
Anxiety,fova7kz,t1_fov8he0,1588097941.0,"That's unfortunate, I'm really sorry that you can't opt out of this stressful situation. I was in limbo for a few weeks, and it was awful. 

Are there any temporary jobs you could take on, just to get out of that environment and give yourself room to find something better? 

I'm a huge money-worrier/saver, so any financial risk (like turning away a salary) is horrific to me, but it might be worth the struggle for a while. I keep a few online jobs in my back pocket so I can jump ship when necessary. They pay the bills during rough times and give me the freedom to stop worrying so much. Just a thought!"

I've been [encouraging](https://www.t-mfrs.com/post/coping-with-a-claustrophobic-mindset-during-covid-19) people to use this time to their advantage on my site instead of moping and wishing for their old forms of escapism. Being bored and drunk the whole time seems like a massive fucking disservice to yourself. 

Having the clear brainspace to look at your life big-picture instead of drudging through daily details completely resets your thinking. People should take advantage, especially folks with anxiety and trauma. These ""down days"" are the periods when I've made the greatest strides in managing all the fun aspects of complex PTSD. They're a blessing.

When I'm working a ""regular schedule"" my mental health goes straight down the toilet, no matter how hard I think I'm working against it. My therapist and I often just end up spending my sessions working through my job drama instead of my childhood trauma... there's something new every week, so it feels like a hamster wheel effect.

I fought to have some remote work days for 2 years to avoid some of the human drama, but even that work set up comes with a different kind of stress. ""What are my coworkers purposely not telling me?"" and other fucked up forms of tribalism/retaliation for not being on-premise.

So, quickly, I agree with ""fuck money"" - my life is continually hustling for cash and putting my joy on the back burner. Work = mental illness for me. Being on an arbitrary schedule and dealing with other people's stress-injections doesn't let me manage my own shit. 

A few years ago, I worked in research from 21-28 and it was killing me. I was a miserable wreck, even though I was actually financially stable and respected at my work for once. When I realized I needed to leave or I would eventually die there, I got myself some contracted online jobs to help pay the bills. Then I took the leap and made art in my basement for 10 months. Eventually, I landed in craft beer logistics, which I never would have anticipated. 

So, maybe try to find some small online jobs if you're always worried about cash flow like I am.

I was also a young woman working in STEM - managing an academic research lab/doing my own research in a cellular biology laboratory. It was terrible. The folks are judgmental egomaniacs a lot of the time and there's a denial of basic human needs. Being an ""authority"" to researchers who were twice my age didn't always go well, and being a woman came with it's own host of sexism/harassment from all ends.

Anyways, I left science after a few years of constant stress/impostor syndrome. I don't use my biology degree and I'm still paying off my debt. But it did serve as a strange, backwards stepping stone to get additional jobs in fairly-unrelated fields.

When my vision feels like it's closing in/blurry, I think it's because I'm so tense that I'm not really breathing or getting enough oxygen in my brain, mixed with being so manic over outside thoughts that my head spins. 

Exercising outside for 1-2 hours helps with all of my symptoms. It brings whatever's bubbling under the surface up to the top, so I can finally deal with it (sometimes I need a week or three of daily practice to get through everything). 

It also necessarily forces you to breath deeply and notice your stomach/chest in a better way (not painful, not tight/constricted... just doing their jobs and keeping you alive).

After getting my brain organized, my body reconnected to my mind, and my excess physical energy out, I feel a lot better. ALWAYS. I cannot stress that highly enough.

Same here, lifer in the categories of anxiety, depression, trauma, etc. I've done great in therapy and figured a great deal of my own life-ruining shit out. I even run a mental health blog and help other people....

BUT, my boyfriend is a real challenge with his anxiety. And his symptoms are exactly what you describe.

In our case, just being there with him helps a lot. Letting him know I understand at least some of what he's feeling, although I don't get the same crippling GI issues. Helping him put words to the sensations seems to be a big assistance - saying so little and still getting the point across to an experienced anxious mess is a relief to him. Touching his shoulder or laying against him when he's panicking. Breathing together, sometimes when we're physically chest to chest, or chest to back, is especially helpful. 

He's recently started making changes to help himself, including getting his meds changed, quitting drinking, and seeking a therapist himself for behavioral therapy. Things are looking up, and his instances of being sick all morning have generally stopped. 

HONESTLY, I think quitting drinking has made the biggest change so far. I'm not sure if that's something you guys are dealing with, but in his case, about 90% of his illness disappeared within 2 weeks of getting sober. Obviously alcohol makes anxiety worse, makes you feel terrible, and then circles back and makes your anxiety worse again when you think you're mysteriously ill/out of control of your body. If that's in the picture, I recommend laying off. 

Otherwise, hell, I'm not an expert, but just being understanding and supportive is a huge help in my relationships. Adjusting your energy to counteract his will reduce his tension. And letting him know that HE isn't a burden is massive."

I also smoke as a coping mechanism. It makes me feel much worse. The only things that actually help are getting outside, getting intensive exercise with unforgiving regularity, and spending a lot of time alone to sort out my shit.

traumaticchildhood,f4sgps2,t1_f4binrp,1571777480.0,"That's so insulting! I'm sorry that you endured that. I think it's incredibly negligent that doctors treated your symptoms so flippantly. 

I guess I'm interested to know how you approached the topic of your diagnosis originally? How you and your husband began navigating the disorder together - how did he get an education on the topic and whatnot? Have you found that setting boundaries are important in your relationship? How do you describe the moods and physical feelings you're having when he doesn't understand? Do you ever attend therapy together? Do you feel a tendency to be codependent?

I understand your reluctance to see a professional for talk therapy. I feel like it really has to be the right person to make a positive difference. Having some background education in psychology makes it even harder for a therapist to be impressive, I think. It sounds like you've always had a handle on some mental health issues, so you'd probably need some deeply relevant information to be blown away by a professional opinion or management strategies. Or, at least that's what I found. I don't need to talk about depression or social anxiety, I know all about those - tell me what the fuck is going on underneath it ALL. 

Thanks for sending those new resources! I haven't heard of BeautyAfterBruises or Feeling Good before. I also find that my education outside of the therapy office is the most significant part of my recovery. Just having facts and scientific information is incredibly empowering. Picking up a book and feeling like it was written ABOUT ME was definitely a helpful experience. Hey, I'm so not-crazy and not-unique that there are publications based on my childhood and daily life. Sweet. 

Also, I love what you said about substances. It's too easy for them to start as a helpful way to detach and snowball into a dependency. ""Coping"" with any substance just delays dealing with the actual issue... and causes fun new issues to manage for the rest of your life.

Organizing my thoughts on paper helps a lot. At least then my worries are always safely stored somewhere, so I can push them out of my brain easier. There's no fear of forgetting them, so I can stop ruminating so much.

I feel like I'm talking to myself about all the weird physical sensations I've experienced cyclically with stress and your incessant inner critic. Would you mind if I shared some of what you've said with my trauma community? It's so good.

My whole body gets tense. Especially shoulders and neck, where I get tension migraines. Also, my chest, abdominals, lower stomach, which is related to shallow breathing and digestive issues. 

Okay, so the weird GI leaky gut thing - I TOTALLY HAVE THIS. I gave up gluten 6 years ago which made a huge difference, but my GI issues continued variably for years after I quit gluten. I definitely treated myself for leaky gut, assuming that it was a byproduct of the intestinal damage during my glutening... but I also never believed it was that simple. For 2-3 years it seemed like my GI problems came and went, without necessarily being gluten related. I even went to the Mayo clinic and tried to get more help with the cyclical illness, but they were literally no help (they just tried to tell me I had physically forgotten how to poop? It's funny in hindsight but I was so fucking angry at the time). 

Most of the time these days, I can get a good gluten dosing and don't suffer at all. But if I'm super stressed out, everything seems to upset my intestines and I stop digesting food properly (if at all). Suddenly, I'm afraid to eat anything again because I start to painfully swell in my abdomen, my digestion goes on vacation, I feel exhausted and sickly, and the mental fog rolls in. I've always noticed that this is accompanied by a weird smell, but it was one of those details that I don't think I gave much merit to or bothered to tell a doctor. I don't know if I could describe it, but maybe a little fruity/solventy/generally ""sickly."" I feel like I'm notifying other members of my species that I'm not fit to be in the herd. Anyways, you just blew my mind mentioning improper digestion and smells. We need to be studied.

How did you find out about your solar plexus? I'm interested in this.

I feel the same about educating myself and finding relief through clinical/biological facts. It MATTERS when you hear that there is a reason for what you're experiencing. Otherwise, it just feels like your body is uncontrollable and working against you - which isn't helpful for an already traumatized outlook on life, haha. Now, at least I know it's real and I have agency to make a difference. Going on walks, keeping myself calm, eating well, sleeping, keeping away from physical self-sabotage, all makes a big difference.  

Have you read ""Complex PTSD - From Surviving to Thriving?"" It has similar mind-exploding details as The Body Keeps the Score - you should check it out. I'm totally with you on how educational and grounding The Body Keeps the Score was when I found it. I couldn't believe all that information was available, and I had been living miserably under a rock for years instead of finding the education I needed.

Also, congrats on your weight loss! Similarly, since I started caring for my body instead of hating it, I've consistently been down 20lbs from my ""heightened trauma"" days. Less peanut butter and cheese binges, less laying in bed for days at a time, less mindless ""filling the void."" Being happy with my body is one less thing for the IC to shame myself about."
traumaticchildhood,f4amxsu,t1_f3ul32x,1571497783.0,"What sorts of things did doctors tell you after ""somatic"" was brought up? I remember them flippantly telling me I should try to be less stressed out before ushering me out of the room, or sort of shrugging and tip-toeing around a therapy recommendation. Either way, they acted like brains and holistic systems weren't part of their responsibilities as a doctor.  

That's a really healthy and refreshing view point of the relationship - thank you for sharing that. I think most people are lacking that understanding of their relationship AND their partner as an individual with the same complex motivations as every other living thing. It sounds like he has faith in you and believes the best, rather than internalizing difficult moments or turning against both of you. 

Would you mind if I shared that with my community? Trauma and relationship dynamics are something that definitely hits home for all of us. Also, if you care to share anything else about your relationship and navigating trauma... that would be really great! I'm looking for intelligent contributions from insightful folks like you."
traumaticchildhood,f3rvrfc,t1_f31alen,1571092718.0,"You're totally right. It's all one massive interconnected system. Perception and physical health are heavily linked, and I feel like modern science has just barely started scratching the surface of those feedback loops. 

I know my pre-medical degree didn't feature any courses on the relationship between psychological and physical dysfunction, haha. Honestly, when my GI tract was going to hell and a few doctors mentioned that it could be psycho-somatic or stress-induced, I felt like they were poo-pooing me and pushing me out the door, rather than being helpful/concerned. Modern healthcare definitely needs a reboot with the brain in mind.

I can relate to the dynamic between you and your husband, as well. I was in a semi-supportive relationship, but it fell apart when it came down to dealing with the finer brass tacks necessary for cohabitating with a traumatized partner. He couldn't get over the ""moods"" I experienced (usually blanking out or getting worked up by anxiety) and always internalized them, which caused anger/resentment, which triggered me and caused more anxiety... you know the drill. Endless cycle of everyone feeling shitty and misunderstood, ramping up towards fights that only solidified my trauma response. 

What tools or conversations have you utilized in your relationship to bridge the gap?"
traumaticchildhood,f3rtm1c,t1_f3p20ye,1571091672.0,"WOW! What a story of trauma repression/comin' to jesus. It sounds like you have a firm grasp on your physical and mental symptoms of trauma, which was really difficult in my experience to even figure out. (""Where does the trauma end and I begin?"" sortof reckoning) How long did it take you to figure out that these health issues were related to mental avoidance?

Super interesting that you mentioned circulation - I haven't seen anyone else bring that up, but it's another commonality that we share. My super PTSD-heavy friend similarly has Raynauds syndrome; I never considered that both of our freezing bodies could be linked by trauma. Thanks for bringing that up! I need to investigate.

Also, ""going easy on myself"" is one of the hardest things I've had to learn. It's so easy for me to be empathetic/compassionate for all other humans and animals, but not towards myself. The inner critic never learned to take a break. 

What tools/activities are you using to keep your health and self-compassion in check? For me, I have to get out and hike 3/4 times a week, stretch, gets tons of sleep, and eat really well... or else I lose my shit mentally and physically. I found that gluten is bad news, as are fried foods and anything processed/sugary. You also mentioned drinking - throwing alcohol into the mix is another major no-no when I'm already in a spiral, so I try to avoid it responsibly. Difficult, working in craft brewing, but I don't need those pro-inflammatory vibes when my body is already lighting up like a Christmas tree.  

Thanks for writing back! Your messages are really insightful and thought-provoking."
traumaticchildhood,f2x8tmc,t3_decws9,1570474993.0,"Speaking to my deepest fears right here. I'm also nearly 30 and have no clue how to form healthy relationships. I'm doing my best!

For most of my life I’ve assumed I was doomed to die alone. It’s really difficult to deal with myself every day, let alone live compatibly with someone else. In my experience, I tend to attract abusers. Right now I’m in the midst of a new relationship, and trying to figure out how to have a healthy connection (as well as how to describe my past and the peculiarities of my trauma diagnosis). 

Hey, the good news is you’re absolutely not alone! I know it feels that way when your “normie” friends are settling down and doing the family thing. Also, I have an online trauma community for folks like us who feel “doomed” - come check it out sometime and see if it might help? I’m literally writing about relationship issues as we speak, and members have relayed similar sentiments. Join in the conversation! www.t-mfrs.com"
traumaticchildhood,f2wiinx,t1_f1e3ots,1570466199.0,"Sorry you went through the same thing! It’s so overwhelming to consider all the aspects of mental and physical trauma that came crashing down all at once. Kind of a neverending chicken and the egg situation. Do you feel the same? 

What’s interesting is, the more trauma research I do, the more I hear about folks (women, in particular) developing autoimmune disorders. It’s actually quite common. All the stress and nervous system activation promotes inflammation and decreases effective immune response. Boom - mysteriously sick, and incapable of recovery until the mental component calms down.

After the relationship I just left, I absolutely don’t think that having someone around would make this experience better. Throwing another traumatized human into the mix really perpetuated my own illnesses - I assume you had something similar happen?

Also, I write about trauma and physical illness (plus lots more), if you’re ever interested in reading more or submitting your own story… www.t-mfrs.com/ourstories/"
traumaticchildhood,f2wgyml,t1_f26hf3c,1570465680.0,I'm glad you feel safe and are seeing someone. Start to learn those coping/processing skills now - you'll need them for life. Stay safe! Holler if you get into crisis territory or feel like exploding. Support is available and you aren't alone.
traumaticchildhood,f2wgnvc,t1_f26noap,1570465571.0,"First of all, your information on enneagrams is really interesting! I haven’t looked into that before, but I’m interested now. The description I found for enneagram 7s sounds very similar to my experiences and coping measures. I think you’re right that trauma is a common thread for this personality type - actually, it seems like a somewhat similar description to the avoidant/flight responses that evolve into hyper-vigilance in trauma sufferers. Constantly staying busy, “running” from deep emotions, always being on the lookout. Do you feel this way all the time?
 
Our experiences sound so similar! I also escaped chaos by becoming an over-achiever. This served as both a safety net (one less reason for negative attention to be on me) and a way out (if I went to school, maybe I could get away from my family’s addiction and poverty). 
 
I also experienced my downfall around 23-24. It’s when I didn’t know how to continue “safely” in life anymore, without academic merit to guide the way. At that time, I also had a bad counselor bring up my past history of early abuse and the PTSD label… after that, I couldn’t get over all the negative memories and emotions that I thought I escaped via education.
 
I’m glad you started seeing a therapist. I think it’s important. Do you feel like you found a good match? Sorry for what happened when you tried to talk to your mom about the past. When other people aren’t ready to acknowledge what happened, it feels like a whole new trauma (in my experience). 
 
It’s awesome that you have positive support in your life! Why do you still feel so isolated and hungry for connection, do you think? What’s missing? Also, do you have any activities that help with the rumination/brain organization? One more questions (sorry) what do you do for work? I’ve also found that a 9-5 is unmanageable, and heard the same from other PTSD sufferers. 
 
I could talk to you about this for hours! I identify with everything you’re saying. You’re not alone!"
AskReddit,f1c5loa,t1_evln939,1569350420.0,"I do basically the same breathing method to sleep at night. 4 in, 7 hold, 8 out. Works like magic. 

My therapist told me to try 25 breaths - I usually get through about 8 before I'm passed out. Lifelong anxiety insomniac, here."
AskReddit,f1c4ldu,t1_evlvgy6,1569349775.0,"Out-breathing, in particular, does something for my body and brain. If I exhale slowly and hold it, I feel like I can get a handle on my crazy pounding heart. 

Must be something to the deep breath/heart connection, outside of all the yoga and woo-woo shit."
AskReddit,f1c3nmq,t3_ckb1q7,1569349174.0,"I pretend I'm sitting in traffic.

You know how some people lose their shit sitting in traffic? They try to zoom between lanes, hitting obstacles everywhere they go? You can feel the tension and frustration radiating off their car. They are definitely more stressed than the other drivers, but aren't making any additional progress for all their energy expenditure. 

I tell myself not to be that guy. There's no sense in getting riled if the situation is out of my control. Sometimes I need to talk out loud or do some writing to confirm that the circumstances ARE out of my control first. After that, I think of the idiot in his BMW almost causing wrecks on the highway because he thinks getting upset will move mountains. 

Briefly, I note the anxious feelings in my body. Tell myself there's no point in freaking out, because I can't change the situation. Concentrate on my out breathing - usually I can find a moment of peace with a long exhale. Try to feel the bottoms of my feet. Redirect my attention to something I CAN control in that moment, like the podcast selection or calling someone important to me."
traumaticchildhood,f1c25cq,t3_d7una8,1569348198.0,"Well fuck. I hope you're okay. I hope you're safe in this household. If you have any doubt, I recommend you get out of that house, now. If you don't know where to go, send out an SOS. Get away from the toxicity and start healing. 

I understand how much you must resent your mother. She's not healthy, and because of her own trauma she's setting her children up for similar problems. It leaves you feeling completely helpless and betrayed, because this person is supposed to protect you. Instead, she can't put her own abandonment/codependent problems aside to remove the threat to herself and her children. It's an unfair and uncontrollable situation for you to be stuck with. I'm sure she doesn't see it this way. 

That being said, don't place all the blame on your mom. She's clearly an abuse victim, herself. Your dad is the antagonist, even if she stands idly by and lets it happen. She probably has a lifetime of pain and abandonment fears that she's coping with. Maybe she doesn't feel like she can be on her own financially. Maybe he's thoroughly convinced her that she can't live without him, or no one else will want her. Maybe she's always felt that way, from her own childhood abuse. Point is, try to find some empathy for mom without letting her pull you under. At least try to soften your heart towards her, knowing she's seen some shit, too. Keep your distance from dad. Someday a therapist will help you process and move past that relationship. 

You seem like an intelligent, thoughtful, and well-spoken 17 year old. Speaking from experience, whenever you can, please get into therapy. Start to unwind the shit you've seen. Don't try to soldier through life without pausing to process all your familial abuse - it will come back to bite you in the ass later, even if you think it's behind you. 

Message me if you need anything. I feel like I'm speaking to my 17 year old self. Hang in there."
traumaticchildhood,f1byv76,t3_d8hmm6,1569346073.0,"Dude. I feel that. Relationships feel impossibly toxic when you're in a traumatized state. Frankly, because they often are. When your primitive brain is running the show, looking out for signs of danger (abandonment) at all times, I don't think you can form a viable, balanced, healthy relationship (friendship or otherwise). Your brain is too busy setting off alarms that ultimately lead you to over-attach and/or sabotage everything. That's my experience, anyways. 

Don't take this the wrong way, but it's a good thing that this relationship cooled down right now. If the guy was receptive to your hyper-vigilant pushing, there would probably be something mentally unhealthy going on with him. You could have wound up in a truly toxic, codependent, and difficult to leave relationship. It sucks that you're feeling triggered and unsettled recently, but be glad that you didn't draw any new problems into your world to perpetuate the bullshit. Again, speaking from experience. An abusive relationship, even one that has some ""good times,"" is so much worse than being on your own. TRUST.

I'm really sorry for your experience this summer. I hope you can find ways to reduce your trauma response. I know a thing or two about not sleeping and ruining relationships when things are out of whack. That's my familiar pattern. 

In the past year I've found ways to manage my trauma and anxiety - all revelations have taken place outside of a relationship, now that I finally have time to concentrate on myself instead of being chased around screaming all the time. Here's what I learned in my singledom (which was also this spring/summer). Get selfish. Stop worrying about your partner, your friends, and difficult family members. Put some attention into what you want and need. Try to enjoy being with YOU, because sometimes (often) that's all you have. Relationships are relationships, but you're stuck with yourself forever. Start building yourself into the person you want to be, and don't let anyone get in the way of your mission. Don't beat yourself up and don't ruminate about the past - the only thing that's unequivocally real and actionable is the current moment. Focus on you, and what you can do right now.

Trauma is pervasive and tricky, but try to accept that it's a part of your physiology. There's nothing wrong with you. Your brain just needs to learn to receive the ""reset"" signal. You can totally do that. 

Sorry for the preach. Good luck in therapy Thursday! Try to feel better and cut yourself some slack."
