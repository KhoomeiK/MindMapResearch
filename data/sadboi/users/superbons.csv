What's the point of buying more masks if you're not gonna wear them? Then he went to 3 supermarkets to buy eggs but all of them were sold out. Then the next day he went hiking with a friend. He said he's going stir crazy being home all week. We're in Los Angeles and it's only been 3 or 4 days since they announced the stay at home order. Sigh."
