ptsd,fr16hxb,t3_gkwu87,1589814174.0,"I was sexually abused by my dad from 0 to 15 years old.

Ok number one thing is listen to your body. The minute your ""gut"" doesnt feel right say the safe word or whatever. Because if u go too far it may trigger memories 

For me is was being the dominate one. But i liked dressing up as a little girl and seducing him like he was a teacher(i wonder why). One day he brought home a whip. I was hesitant because i dont like being like painfully dominant. Because of what happened to me i dont like pain and pleasure going hand in hand. Because with sex i know thats how ""he"" was with me. But we tried it anyway thinking he was one wanting it.  then he stopped me because i was whiping him and he made this child like cry while yelling the safeword. And god,  it sounded like i was hearing my 4 year old self so i dropped the whip right away and we cried together. He told me he found out throigh my mom at the beginning what happened to me and to be careful. So he thought that what i did in the bedroom would heal me. When you play sex games you actually need to go over certain things that could mentally follow you after sex games are over. You either feel amazing or you feel defeated. Communication.

And i cant emphasize this enough DO NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOUR SEXUAL DESIRES UNLESS THEY CAN HURT SOMEONE."
ptsd,fquxclf,t3_gktp3f,1589665969.0,"Its ok. The shaking is a defense mechanism for you saying ""stop tLking or it gets worse"". And you should change the subject.

Im so sorry. I know it sounds strange but my father was a private investigator. He sexually abused me because he could. He was ALWAYS there. Like always where I was. Parked outside school all day. Parked outside my friends houses. Sat in on my sports practices. Followed me when i walked to the bus stop. He knew i knew he was there. And being at home was worse touching me innapropriately and making me stay up until 4am until i got a math problem right.

I kept thinking, hes not some world terrorist. But he was MY terrorist. He stopped bOthering me when he remarried and moved to africa because he is *such a saint* 

It might take a while to recover, but I PROMISE you will. I felt like i was being followed for a long time after he left. The old look over the shoulder thing was so constant i ran into a few poles lol. He even slashed my tires and would move my car (not his and did not buy for me) in different spotz of the city i live in before he left for africa. 

Point is, i learned to realize to that i was in control. This is my life not his. Your pedophile is a worm and and you are the bird. Not the other way around. Take a self defense class. Get a tazer.

You know something super farfetched that most of you know is prob true. Family members think of it that way but will deny it or shame you because they dont want to believe something like that can happen in your family. I remembered in my 20s which is normal for child abuse victims. I told my brothers and they blamed it on my mental illness like YOU REALLY DONT THINK THAT ASSHOLE MAY HAVE A PART OF MY MENTAL STATE? I have a feeling my dad did stuff to them too and they are in denial. Especially my older brother. Do not doubt your memories. Dont let their doubt steer you from your intuition. If your body reacts to sexual things in an uncomfortable way you dont understand, it happened. The body remembers everything always.

And especially, dont have a relationship with your father. You may have to cut many ties including financial but its worth it in the long run. You will meet people like you and people who empathize like you should have gotten from your mom. My mom beleived me right away bbecause of how he was with her and it happened to her when she was little by a neighbor. Surround yourself with people who understand and a thetepist to walk you through. This is something you will question and question until you ""tell"" yourself it didnt happen; unless you cut toxic ties. Dont waste anymore time trying to prove to your family. They really know the truth, just know that. But its not up to you to have them say it. Its time to take care of you. This is your life. You have control now. You deserve to be happy"

And when I say troll i say the scum on the bottom of my shoe trying to take away any light any one else has. You are a leech. You have nothing of your own so you spend your time taking from what others have instead of looking inside your own self to acheive it. But when you look inside you see what I said. Just a cockroach lurking in a house watching people walk bye. Wanting to be them. Yet the fix is so easy. But you cant stand it and you cant stand yourself.
Isnt that right, TRUE EMPATH?

Dont ever post on my page again with such filth. Is that a threat? .....maybe. Maybe. Maybe I have allibies such as a P.I. relative amd a hacker friend who works for the military (also helped me a few times). Maybe this is true..... Maybe. And putting that pain on other people who are asking for help in a time of need? You disgust me. I was born in hell. Iknow how it works. I dont live there anymore. But you do, and you LOVE it. I know exactly who you are. You dont. And thats what is very sad."

Empaths,fp9ru88,t1_fp9mg2h,1588433229.0,I live next to a huge river but our governer wont let us go there. I understand of course. But i used to do this thing where i lay upside down on the bank and let all my hair on my head flow in the water with my body on the shore. That used to be the ultimate meditation feeling i could get too. I miss nature so much. Thank you. Oh and i disconnected too. Because i will disacociate if it keeps beinh in my face. All i wanna know are the rules for today and then tomorrow and so on. Nothing else

Empaths,fp9qmzr,t1_fp8h9il,1588432494.0,"Okay its like im hearing you say ""i hate when people say their depressed when they dont even know the true meaning of depression. Go get a pill.""

Being an empath isnt a competition. Just like being depressed isnt. We feel what we feel in different states of being and culture. Sorry to have upset you."
bipolar,fp72l4a,t3_gbfvjl,1588362897.0,Omg okay so i live with my mom and at one point we were both on seraquel and the first night we both took 150mg and ordered 3 pizzas and watched movies. But that shit makes you drunk so we both kept falling off the bed. We were watching night court and laughing at parts that werent funny. It was the best

ghibli,foqn5co,t1_fopc78p,1587997128.0,Yeah definitly. When you put it like that it doesnt seem so bad. I relate to the children too much. Seeing them suffering so they make a world of their own to get by. Its oddly enchanting
ghibli,fopb9tx,t1_fopau17,1587957252.0,"I didnt yet. O watched the first half hour. Animation amazing. But i.stopped. i have a hard time when it comes to children. I know everyome is in a way. But it reminded me of aspects of my own childhood(survival, being.neglected) so that might be the reason i cant finish it. I can at some point because hayao is the grandpa i never had and i need to watch all his movies lol"
ghibli,fopalz3,t1_fop8ye2,1587956814.0,Its just like... I cant believe we did that. I learned about it in school but never really sunk in. Maybe thats the reaaon he made it. Just to spread awareness of it. Japan is about the size of california. Imagime the wide spread destruction of a atom bomb on a country so small. War is so pointless and its the civilians that pay for it.
