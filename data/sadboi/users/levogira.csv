I just think that at the end of the day the two HSV manifest more or less the same and OP should get tested to know which one of them it is, since no one can tell just by looking at a picture. Supposing it *is* HSV, and it could be nothing also.

Edit: I don't need to *agree* with what you said because you stated *facts*, and those are not debatable. So let's just say you're the one with the best information here."
STD,fpk9jsp,t1_fpk70qo,1588690591.0,"Aight, as you can see it's an assumption, I used the word *usually*. The only way to know is to get a blood test done. We could *argue* it's either one of the Herpes family *or* primary syphilis *or* nothing at all. I am no medical practitioner but I have been in closed contact with a lot of STDs in my life so I'm just here to help get an idea of *what it might be*. 

If it is one of the Herpes it doesn't really matter since he will carry the virus anyway, independently of which one of the two it is. I have Herpes type I, which as you will know is commonly known as *oral herpes*, and I haven't once infected anyone in the genital area. It still can happen, certainly, but it is not as common, and it's treated the same way practically."
STD,fpk8mam,t1_fpk73lp,1588690091.0,"Well, the sores are indeed symptoms. It's weird that they grow in the shaft where there's no public hair.

STD,fpk6atx,t1_fpk60xi,1588688827.0,"So those sores appeared these days right? It looks like herpes. It's a virus and you'll carry it all your life, but it's manageable. It's specially infectious when the sores appear. Get checked tho."
STD,fpk5rgk,t1_fpk57lj,1588688527.0,"Not necessarily. You see the cold sores people sometimes have on the lips? That's herpes simplex I. On the genitals it's usually Herpes Simplex II. 

Now it could also be primary stage syphilis, but I doubt it since syphilis manifests as a unique sore, not a cluster, and doesn't appear on the testicles but on the head of the penis, where the bacteria entered the body. 

Edit: this seems to be the shaft of the penis, not testicles, sorry. 

Anyway, none of them is a big deal, you should get checked tho to be treated. If it is herpes which seems the most probable STD here you'll have some symptoms a handful times a year, not that bad.
