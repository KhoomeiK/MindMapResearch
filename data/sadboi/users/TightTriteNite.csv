SunKilMoon,fqzbajw,t3_ga4mgb,1589763768.0,"Andy Shauf nails the storytelling aspect of SKM. I'm not sure if it's intentional, but albums like the neon skyline give me serious Benij and post Benji vibes. Little bits of dialogue and info that mean so much more in context. Also beautiful instrumentation and writing. A lot of his work feels like a breadcrumb trail or recurring themes and people. Definitely feels in the same vein, whether intentional or not. I know an absurdly stupid amount of info about MK, I also know an absurdly stupid amount of info amount AS, just as a byproduct of how they each write."
ireland,fq9kv64,t1_fq9knlq,1589201107.0,I think that's got more to do with the socioeconomics behind the UFCs demographic than any political affiliation. You'd be hard pressed to find UFC fans who are at the matches simply because they support ones right to consent to be harmed for entertainment. Correlation isn't causality.

UpliftingNews,fpmbo00,t1_fpm5dtf,1588729599.0,"Hey nice one! One minor correction is that over here we say county cork or county X instead of X county. I have absolutely no idea why, I suppose it's just part of the vernacular! We also have a sculpture in North cork entitled 'kindred spirits' in honour of the Choctaw tribe, who donated money to our nation during the famine in spite of living in great hardship themselves. The famine is an incredibly important part of our history over here, and the sculpture is one of the more hopeful ones in Ireland that details one of our darkest hours. Having your land occupied by people who don't have your best interests at heart is apparently universal, and we'll always be thankful to our brothers across the pond for that gesture of charity and selflessness."

We know that the symptoms of COVID-19 (such as fever) can cause complications within the first trimester  but because we still don't understand how COVID-19 might affect the overall development of a fetus, general guidelines over here are for pregnant women to protect themselves against it just in case. Not sure what the CDC recommends."
nottheonion,fotsmmb,t1_fotpra3,1588064668.0,"The mortality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be about 3-4% globally (WHO official statistic), not 0.0001%. The severity of one person's case does not have any effect the severity of the virus in the people they transmit it to. Anyone elderly, pregnant or with preexisting medical conditions are far more likely to develop severe complications and potentially die. As such, regardless of the severity of COVID-19 in a young healthy person, they may still inadvertently transmit and kill other people who are at risk."
nottheonion,fots5jm,t1_fotqkrj,1588064190.0,"Hospitals aren't overwhelmed *because* people are staying home, thus flattening the curve. This is the idea. It's also how my country has avoided catastrophe, but we're not out campaigning to prematurely reopen society and undo all of our sacrifices. Not everywhere all over America is adequately equipped with PPE, as I'm sure you've seen. The data from NYC was gathered from a small sample three thousand thousand people who were already outside the home (and more likely to have antibodies as a result). Extrapolating that to a population 8.3 million people and concluding that everybody has already had it and is fine is absolutely ludicrous. If, within about two months 50k Americans have died with social distancing and stay at home measures actually in place, how do you expect those numbers to not even double by the end of the year with them lifting as early as now? You also seem to be misunderstanding why oil prices hit a negative. If there is no demand for oil due to the pandemic, it is costly to store the imported oil that just sits around, thus the negative market value. This is essentially a halt on the global oil trade due to exceptional circumstances, not a global oil crash as such. I assure you, the federal government are not going to print more money in any impactful amount, that generally causes inflation which is something the federal government has historically frowned upon (as it devalues the strength of the dollar). The 'fake news media' are not trying to scare people. Experts on these matters are simply trying to warn you."
nottheonion,fotpzci,t1_fotmz3z,1588061996.0,"Much of that is factually incorrect and downright childish so I'm not going to engage with it. I come from a country with a low death toll, but I was indeed horrified at the situation in Spain and Italy. Those countries unfortunately served as a warning to the rest of us and we took it to heart. You can get angry all you like but it doesn't change the objective truth (that people will needlessly die) or absolve you of a moral duty to care about people more vulnerable than you. I sincerely hope that TN doesn't serve as an example to the rest of America as to how serious COVID-19 really is."
nottheonion,fotk32r,t1_fotdcxp,1588056375.0,"The current number of cases (regardless of severity) combined with the premature opening up of society causes the rate of transmission to shoot up massively. Cases who might only infect people in the household can now infect twice to three times as many other people, especially if they are asymptomatic transmitters. This causes an exponential jump in cases. As a European, y'all haven't even been under lockdown for half as long as most of us have. It baffles me how fine you are with yourself fellow countrymen (many of whom have no choice but to work in ill equipped environments at the fear of losing their jobs) dying or putting their kids/parents at risk because you'd rather not wait until further progress is made with treatment and vaccination. We all have lives we'd like to get back to but it is our ethical obligation to do what we can to save the lives of those who will die without these measures."

I think about him every day, and had I known that he was in pain I'd have done everything in my power to help him. It's impossible to describe how much love was expressed for him after he was gone. He will never be a foggy memory to me, it's all too visceral. You shouldn't feel guilty for feeling how you feel but you should also understand that you don't understand how much you're loved until after the fact. Had he heard the things that people said about him after he was gone maybe he'd have understood that. There are no foggy memories when you lose somebody that should have lived as long as you will."

If you're looking to begin getting help, it might be a good idea to see a GP.

Naturally, distancing yourself from other users is also a good idea if you can do so.
