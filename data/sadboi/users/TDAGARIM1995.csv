Pete_Buttigieg,fj8qxnp,t3_fc3fjd,1583119943.0,"This is hands down the best subreddit I have ever been a part of. I’ve never met any of you, but you all are some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. I never thought I would say that about a political subreddit, but here we are. Pete facilitated kindness and provided a platform for people to be their best selves, all in the context of a political campaign. Think about that. In addition to his policies, (which promised a better future for all of us) he is the only candidate that consistently promoted a fundamental change in how we look at politics. That’s pretty amazing and, with an eye towards 2024 and beyond, I’ll always be grateful for the sense of belonging and understanding he provided me with. It’s been a pleasure. See y’all in 4 years"

Pete_Buttigieg,fismh5b,t3_f9jz4l,1582687853.0,"It’s not particularly right or fair, but in order for national pundits to talk about Pete, he has to win decisively....without the cloud of a vote counting fiasco hanging over his victory....he’s not a former Vice President, he’s not a senator or a billionaire...just being even-keeled and articulate is not enough to get people talking...not without momentum...like I said it’s not fair but I think it’s a fact"
Pete_Buttigieg,fipd12g,t3_f92wh7,1582603587.0,"Thank y’all for enlightening me on this particular anecdote I have to admit I hadn’t heard it before and I was worried that groups like queers against Pete might run with it...tbh I was rather rushed in making the comment b/c now that I think about it I can totally see where’s he’s coming from...while I’m not gay, I do have cerebral palsy and I  have thought about choosing to be able-bodied if that choice could be offered...anyway thanks again for the new perspective on that line"
Pete_Buttigieg,fipbfl1,t3_f92wh7,1582602441.0,That whole if I could’ve taken a pill not to be gay thing is definitely gonna be taken out of context and criticized

Pete_Buttigieg,fioh7bh,t3_f8o60o,1582583259.0,This thread makes me think most everybody has given up on Pete...I mean it’s gonna be an uphill battle but we can still win the era!
Pete_Buttigieg,fiiw666,t1_fiiw30g,1582428417.0,Thank y’all for all the positive and uplifting comments it’s hard because Pete is the first political candidate I’ve ever truly believed in and it’s hard to see the negative press and the low-ish numbers but part of the reason why I love PFA is all my fellow supporters...this group is super cool and I’m proud to be a part of it
