Pete_Buttigieg,fj8qxnp,t3_fc3fjd,1583119943.0,"This is hands down the best subreddit I have ever been a part of. I‚Äôve never met any of you, but you all are some of the nicest people I‚Äôve ever met. I never thought I would say that about a political subreddit, but here we are. Pete facilitated kindness and provided a platform for people to be their best selves, all in the context of a political campaign. Think about that. In addition to his policies, (which promised a better future for all of us) he is the only candidate that consistently promoted a fundamental change in how we look at politics. That‚Äôs pretty amazing and, with an eye towards 2024 and beyond, I‚Äôll always be grateful for the sense of belonging and understanding he provided me with. It‚Äôs been a pleasure. See y‚Äôall in 4 years"

Pete_Buttigieg,fiiw666,t1_fiiw30g,1582428417.0,Thank y‚Äôall for all the positive and uplifting comments it‚Äôs hard because Pete is the first political candidate I‚Äôve ever truly believed in and it‚Äôs hard to see the negative press and the low-ish numbers but part of the reason why I love PFA is all my fellow supporters...this group is super cool and I‚Äôm proud to be a part of it
