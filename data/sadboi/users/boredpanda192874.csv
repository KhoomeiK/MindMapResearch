I focused mainly on startups, especially the ones that brag on their websites about how they're international and diverse.

I would apply to jobs found on LinkedIn and Indeed. If I heard nothing after a week, I would try to find someone on LinkedIn from that company and ask to speak to them about the position. Many times I was ignored, but sometimes it did work and I was able to get a few initial interviews. I've been told your portfolio is more important than your resume so make sure that's solid.

As for the moving/visa process, it's still a bit early and I'm going through that now. There's tons of blogs online about it though! From what I researched, the visa is a lot of precise paper work and could take awhile. Housing is hard to find and the way they describe things in a housing contract is somewhat different from the US so you have to be careful. If you're looking to do this next year, look at the visa requirements now to make sure you have enough time to meet the qualifications.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions"
cscareerquestionsEU,fjguzzn,t1_fjfqbvb,1583336042.0,"Application process - I think they are both pretty similar. Sometimes before the initial phone screen, they'll send you a Leetcode-like problem to weed out people. Your initial phone screen will be with HR or someone in tech (if it's a smaller start up), and then the technical part, which is usually a project. The final interview will be meeting with someone to go over your solution. I had a live technical interview once about Fibonacci and passing some tests, but I do not think this is common in Europe. 

Resume - I did the research on the differences in European and American resumes, but honestly I don't think it matters too much. Your portfolio is more important. If you have prior work experience, try to put only the technical things. For example, I had worked in accounting so I focused on what I did with the systems. Otherwise, just focus on your projects and the tech knowledge you do have.
