SuicideWatch,es7tqex,t1_eqse3s2,1561679578.0,"Anything is possible! My sister graduated with a BS in Biology. I think she had a semester left when she realized that she didn't want to do Biology anymore and wanted to be a programmer. After she graduated, she took a 6-month course for programming. Now my sister works as a software engineer for a startup tech company. 

You have to do what you want in order to live the life you want."
findapath,eobvgfj,t3_br8zoo,1558448985.0,"I'm kind of in the same boat currently. I got a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and I am now a Project Engineer for a international company. I moved cross country for this job and they offered me pretty good money. 

After a while, I become super unmotivated in my job. I was having the quarter life crisis because I didn't want to do it anymore and I wasn't passionate about it anymore. I realized that if you don't want to do the job, you don't have to. You can just find another job if you want to. I started to look into more creative jobs, but I didn't meet most of the requirements since I have an engineering degree. I got disheartened and I didn't know what to do. 

So I started searching for jobs that I was qualified for. I realized that not all engineering jobs have to be super technical. I'm about to accept an offer for a company as Application Engineer where I'm going to working with sales a lot. 

All you need to do is switch your mindset. Like other another commenter said, there are tons of laborious engineering positions like Field Engineers and anything with construction. 

Hope you find your way with this! I believe in you!"
