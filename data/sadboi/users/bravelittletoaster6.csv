IAmA,flz164e,t3_frv7op,1585613301.0,"One more: what is the deal with hormonal based birth controls and mood instability? I can’t use the copper IUD and the birth control oral took about 3 month to feel “ok”; basically, is this the best that it can be? Furthermore, I’ve found a medication that works satisfactory, but my psych still wants me to experiment with others. When I do I have bad side effects, so I stop. Again, is this as good as it can get and am I just spinning my wheels thinking that there is some cocktail that will make me feel stable all of the time?"
IAmA,flz0fy0,t3_frv7op,1585612863.0,"Hi! How do you address your family when they don’t believe that you are bipolar and are always trying to normalize your symptoms being like, well, maybe it’s PMS, maybe it’s because you’re a Gemini? How do you educate those who fail to fundamentally understand the disease? Most of the information/literature about BP usually is about BP1, so my BP2 diagnosis makes my family doubt that I actually am bipolar. My family doesn’t understand how terribly difficult it is, and always tell me to relax and like, watch a movie or do yoga. I feel like I always have to try and justify/explain what is me and what is BP."
BipolarSOs,fb8ndim,t1_falppkm,1576617647.0,"Oh man, that sounds super hard, I’m so sorry to hear of your isolation. I appreciate that you respect it being “his story to tell,” but talking with other people about these challenges may help. I know that NAMI has different support groups for people with BP and those who love them; maybe see if there is a chapter near you? And most certainly you can push him to address his depression! He’s not managing his disease and that’s not fair to you. Maybe start with small tasks like hygiene and laundry? Then reward him for a job well done! Give him doable things that he can gain some confidence back with. Depression sucks, but so does a lot of things, and in the end it’s what you do with the hand that you’ve been dealt that makes you a hero or a villain. Also check out bphope.com— they have a lot of posts and articles about ways to cope with BP. Good luck! BP fucking sucks, but it is what it is, and it’s not worth being miserable about indefinitely, so keep your chin up! This too will pass."
BipolarSOs,falb01z,t3_e9s8qb,1576181362.0,"It seems like he needs meds and talk therapy. It’s not fair to have these prolonged and excessive down spells. It’s a disease, yes, but there are tools to better manage it. But step one is the right medication and the right therapist. Can anyone, besides you, give him a kick in the ass? I’m BP so I’m speaking from experience. When I’m in a depressive episode therapy really helps, as does forcing myself to work, exercise, etc. not easy, but doable."
