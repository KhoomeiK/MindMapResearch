Something i sometimes say is; if you would experience life as i do, this would seem like a great comedy to you.

If you manage to handle your birth condition whatever autism actually is, life can be interesting to say the least.

Im not speaking of huge doses or other obvious psychedelics which you cant miss, but saying supps and drugs are any different is just ignorance. If you use pure cocaine in limited amounts the benefits and risks are legitimately the same as supplements. Common drugs just have a tendency to be obviously mind altering since the high is what drives addiction. If you know what to look for supplements have a high as well, are addicting and have health risks.

I quit weed recently since i realise it was only a temporary help and honestly none of the things i mentioned, are actually helpful without guidance. But fact is the allow you to accept guidance while without these things i so far couldn't even talk about the abuse i had experienced. Im planning on going to a ayahuasca ritual sometime in the future, cause i believe especially the multi day repeated ceremonies can help rewire your brain with proper shamanic guidance combined with a clear intent.

Edit: weed has helped me think about these things in a realistic view, although it hasnt change anything in terms of how i am able to deal with them. Acid also helped me talk about the abuse i experienced for the first time, again didnt change how i dealt with it just managed to open me up, asi had that intent when i took the Acid with a friend."

Drugs are nothing but a shortcut or the tool for something you might or might not achieve yourself.

I am happy that i did, cause hell i don't know how i would've ended if i didn't. Weed has taught me some amazing lessons about life and even though i could never hold onto a break for very long, the break i'm having now feels much more different (about 2 weeks in, smoked with friends last weekend, crazy dreams right now), especially since i'm not hating myself for weed consumption, but simply coming to terms with the fact that i currently have no control over it, if i got my own stash that is.

Anxiety isn't = anxiety is what im trying to say. Being a stoner has taught me to love myself and stand above what people think of me, also realise they really do not care as much as i ever thought they did. As such most problems i faced which led to me starting to smoke have gotten much better (social stuff mainly), and these things i won't be forgetting about, when making the habit a luxury again.

&#x200B;

I feel like i was dependent on other people to guide me through things, cause i didn't believe in myself enough, Weed showed me i can be confident and happy about my own abilites and as such i depended on weed, now i replace depending on weed with depending on my own abilites.

With only having joined his project a couple weeks ago, i've already noticed the huge amount of support and interest in something like this. I mean working hours nowadays are literally 50%+ wasted for bureaucracy, establishment and paperwork which isn't required, as well as traveling between places.

&#x200B;

While this is an amazing experience, and i think we have a very good future in front of us, it also shows you problems with your own working ways, routines, behaviour etc. which is absolutely phenomenal, as it gives you a much better learning process (although the hardest part about it, as you have nearly no rules and our working world builds on rules). This project also shows me the problem behind why this isn't done sooner, which mostly lies in the fact that until such a project is actually rolling and making enough money to sustain its workers, we are reliant on government money to support us. (i've always hated growing up in switzerland as i always thought our potential to better the world is huge, although noone makes anything besides money with it. This is also the reason such a project doesn't really work that well in other places, as social services and welfare money is extremely limited and as such starting a project like this, is nearly impossible without some wealthy sponsor.)

&#x200B;

I don't really know what i want to say with this besides give it a try, talk to people and spread your idea. I plan on developing this into a much bigger organisation, which isn't only working with IT, but rather in every area of work. If you cut out everything related to trust, money managment and other related things, having far fewer working hours is actually a reality. I feel like theres a lot of people interested in something like this but noone is starting it, so once you get the word out and start yourself, theres a huge amount of people ready to join.

Excuse me for the missing red line, i myself am not quite certain what my next steps are and as such just wanted to dump a bit of info for you.. I'm thinking about creating a community online in order to gather ideas and spread them to the right people, although i honestly can't really point to something specific yet.

EDIT: I'm mainly steering towards a system working with Meristocracy + UBI, hiring people all over the world, giving them an income to build a healthy environment in order for them to be able to start working and sustain themself. Once people see how much interest there is, i think a lot will wake up from the psychotic state our society has ended in. This would be a way to create ubi without support from your state/political partys, as politics is literally a game of veto nowadays."
ADHD,es8nfla,t1_es8bmvw,1561704940.0,"As long as you can't laugh about these stereotypes (especially since they do come from somewhere), you'll be adding things to your brain, which make you lose focus. While AdHd isn't a superpower that's gifted for doing nothing, it is a superpower if you learn how to use your brain and executive function. Our modern world isn't the place for us to grow up in (if this is they way modern world will be run), mentors can teach you how to use ""disorders"" to your advantage, as they aren't disorders but rather mutations evolution has made thousands of years back due to people requiring it (mentors don't really exist nowadays but humanity never existed without them). In the modern world the people that do end up learning to control their emotional and mental state end up being able to take advantage from this, as intelligence isn't intrinsic but the genes you are given are. Cherrish what you have instead of crying about it cause it won't ever change, and unless you hate your own character because of the way you are from nature, and not because the majority tells you to do so,  there's a ton of help out there if you want to learn how to make your mind see the potential in this gift from nature.  


Also fuck anything i just said, because i didn't manage to achieve most of these things without therapy for adhd. I don't think it's needed but as i had literally noone wanting to research things for me, i had to do that myself and find my own way to fix things. Nowadays even just months after starting medication, i am able to work without relying on medication. This is getting better day to day, and books like ""Inner Engineering, A yogi's guide to joy"" definitly do help in these things."
aspergers,ern0cdw,t1_erl7yc8,1561041650.0,"I think it might be related to the way stimming is experienced from an autism standpoint. The traditional way of stimming comes from the adhd aspect, where repetitive motion is a way to beat the unwanted loss of focus. By saying from an autism standpoint, I'd say their stimming can also go in a very dissociative direction, as well as a higher need for mental stimulation. This also is related to the wiggling stim, which is also a reaction to overwhelming environmental sensory stimulation, dissasociating with your environment by wiggling in a repetitve motion, give you a constant to hold on to."

So use your free time to introspect meditate and take time for yourself and do it when you want to do it. If you feel forced to be alone I honestly can't help since I have that problem sometimes and even though I know there's solutions, being alone makes being miserable not feel so heavy on others, which I sometimes value higher, thus making me the wrong person to ask. I am trying to work on a social net in different forms though, I believe community has been lost too much in our times, and our people have to gather sometimes.

The gene idea of autism could also relate to this to the himalayas, or other harsh condition roots of this way of life. The more focused life on surviving and rational decisions is required, and social communication is driven by information.
