Fitness,ewt5n0s,t3_cptvr0,1565740331.0,"Not really? I always do a core routine before bed on top of my other workouts that sometimes I‚Äôll do some neck rolls, and toe touches after too. I often roll my shoulders and stretch my back throughout the day, but the only ‚Äúproper‚Äù stretching I do is my 1 yoga class a week lol"

EDAnonymous,ewecko9,t1_ewec9x4,1565320152.0,"If you struggle with lots of exercise simply practice adding in more rest days or forcing yourself not to for a day every week. It sucks but helps break the cycle,"

EDAnonymous,ewebo92,t1_eweaq22,1565319466.0,"I started going to a few gym classes almost a year ago, starting with cardio stuff actually, it turned into a full fledged addiction along with developing an ed and I HAD to go everyday, I did both cardio and weight classes, I‚Äôm currently recovering and only doing weight training 3x a week (30-60minutes each time) I also do core and balance classes 3x a week before or after my weight stuff (30-60minutes) i also do light core training exercises every night no longer then 10 minutes and 1-3 times a week I‚Äôll go on short walks ;) I really miss all the other classes I used to do such as HIIT And running on a treadmill but I‚Äôm going to slowly reintroduce those as I gain back more weight. I‚Äôve noticed my biceps and legs getting more muscular already and only being eating in a surplus for 3-6 weeks"
EDAnonymous,ewea328,t1_ewe6ix2,1565318264.0,I still very much struggle with feeling fake too. But I‚Äôd rather sustainably loose slowly and still get to eat lots of healthy stuff then loosing super fast. Good luck!

I loose motivation the minute my body dysmorphia hits or the scale goes up quicker then I‚Äôd like it.

EDAnonymous,ewb97hk,t1_ewb6iey,1565262018.0,"I do understand I need to be honest and some weeks I will naturally loose, maintain or gain very little especially as my metabolism will speed up when I properly commit to eating the minimum calories. It‚Äôs just simply that my parents are going away overseas next week and they were so worried they would have to cancel due to making sure I‚Äôm okay and I really don‚Äôt want to scare them so they can enjoy their trip without needing to worry about me."

fitmeals,ew8pwl9,t1_ew8nhe5,1565213372.0,This sounds like what I ate at my worst stages of anorexia and how I got so underweight. It definitely works for weight loss but still keeping some muscle I can tell you that. Just please don‚Äôt continue this diet for more then 6 months otherwise you could loose too much weight and become underweight like I am now.

And then I think I‚Äôm always bigger then others but when I ask my mum she‚Äôs like no you‚Äôre easily the most thin in the room or whatever. BODY DISMORPHIA SUCKS

EDAnonymous,ew58j06,t3_cmrina,1565130215.0,"I struggled with this so bad until I started recovery and eating 3 proper meals and 3 snacks almost everyday. It took quite a few weeks until I was genuinely feeling hungry for food again. I still struggle with feeling hungry sometimes, especially when I‚Äôve been restricting it messes it up. I‚Äôm in no way recovered or weight restored but eating more regularly and properly for long enough does bring back hunger if you were wondering :)"
