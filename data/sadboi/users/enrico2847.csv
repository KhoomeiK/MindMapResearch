As long as you are trying to make corrections you are win. Eventually the trying will turn into doing and pay dividends. 


And think your long comments are dope... people are too lazy to read in this social media landscape.  People write captions vs comments with nuance and depth. 
Anything over 140 characters is too long to hold peoples attention.

Count one minute off... 

Then one hour... 

Then one day...


Look in the mirror and see yourself every morning and force a smile ... then see a therapist and talk it out. 

I am not going to tell you things will get better because I‚Äôve been there and you won‚Äôt believe it. I still only half way believe it. 

But just wait and things WILL get better. You don‚Äôt need deep belief or faith just time.

Only because I‚Äôve felt that way over a lifetime. I was abused as a child and neglected. My mom had me as a teenager and is a hoarder and my Dad abandoned us. Half the time we were homeless.  

I managed to mask it and make some accomplishments but at times things come unraveled. I would say GOOD JOB taking the bull by the horns at 24 via therapy. I waited too long and it costs me sooo much.

Meaning, if you experience rejection frame that rejection as her loss or her failure to see the good in you.  Try not to take a possible lack of interest on her part as an indictment of your worth (emphasis in the possible; you never know). 

I know that‚Äôs easier said than done.  Trust me I‚Äôm right in this mental rabbit hole with you. And I can barely take my own advice but it IS good advice.

I would add tho‚Äô that it‚Äôs dangerous to live for someone else long term, as humans can let you down and you can‚Äôt control them nor fully understand them. I fell into that trap.  I hope we all find the strength to live for ourselves.‚ù§Ô∏è"
