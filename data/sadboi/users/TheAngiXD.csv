Onision,ffq5ajd,t3_euj73v,1580121283.0,"I only casually watched his videos. I just watched videos like ""I rate your favorite songs"" and harmless stuff like that. All the weird shit just completely went under my radar. At one point I saw a video of someone talking about some of the shit he's doing and all the drama and I went further down the rabbit hole. I immediately unsubscribed and never wanted to see a video of his ever again."

depression,f76rwlz,t1_f76ml77,1573434171.0,"Yeah, I feel that too. I also notice how I'll often say I like something just because the other person likes it, even if I don't like it at all. I literally feel like I'm nothing"
depression,f6rm2wj,t1_f6r4dpr,1573109445.0,"Yeah, I constantly listen to music, but I think talking to myself actually makes me feel a little bit better in a weird way"
depression,f6qdb22,t1_f6qbo2f,1573075190.0,"Thanks for the kind words and the hug, even just in text form, is very much appreciated :)"
depression,f6q32yh,t1_f6q2vcu,1573069961.0,Seeing all the nice comments and people who feel the same way is definitely helping me feel less alone with this. And honestly same. It's like I'm just that one side character that drives the plot along a little bit but then becomes unimportant. Or an NPC in a video game
depression,f6q2ppt,t1_f6q24it,1573069723.0,That's a really nice thought. I guess I need to pay more attention to myself

depression,f6pg4cc,t1_f6ovfh3,1573055586.0,"It kinda feels like a ""make your own character"" sheet, which every person I interact with gets and I'll behave accordingly"
depression,f6pfp8r,t1_f6pfe8t,1573055318.0,I've honestly never seen it that way. Your comment definitely holds a lot of truth
depression,f6paswk,t1_f6pacat,1573052001.0,Honestly same. When I drink alcohol I at least actually talk and try to add something to a conversation. I can't say that I'm easy to be around when I'm drunk though
depression,f6p0ey3,t1_f6oxony,1573043358.0,"Yeah, I also do it to kind of sort my thoughts out. I guess verbalizing all that stuff also helps me to cope with things and put stuff into perspective."

depression,f6n9w06,t1_f6n9ljt,1572987275.0,Omg yes. That's one of the reasons that are holding me back from getting help
