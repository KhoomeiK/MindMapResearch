Wednesday night she threatened my job and I love icu nursing. I have a history of depression and anxiety. My mom also committed suicide. 

2 hours after she text me Wednesday I overdosed on klonopin, Benadryl, vistaril, seroquel, and Prozac. I spent 3 days in the hospital hallucinating, cussing out staff, ripping IVs out. It was fucking insanity honestly.
