Me a message and I’ll talk to you all night! I felt the exact same way when I was with my ex fiancée. He was a pos and truly was a detriment to my mental health. I literally felt more alone being with him than by my side. Hugs."
SuicideWatch,fnftie3,t3_g1gcj2,1586915139.0,"Hey.. wanna send me a
Message? It’s more personal. I have a son. He’s 13. He’s just like you, same mind set. Except he’s dead. He killed himself three months ago. When you’re depressed it is so easy to find and focus on the negative things in life. It’s okay to be upset. It’s okay to be concerned about your sexuality, it’s not a big deal. This is a rough patch in life. You are not alone. If you need someone to listen I’ll listen to you all night if I have to with nothing but love."
SuicideWatch,fnft3pv,t3_g1ffp9,1586914894.0,Hey friend. Can you send me a message? I’ll gladly listen to anything you want to tell me ❤️
SuicideWatch,fnfsgag,t3_g1f7gj,1586914505.0,"I’m a 20 year old f. Don’t base your happiness on someone else. Find it within. I’m not being cliche, I know how you feel. My ex fiancé was horribly abusive but I was scared to leave him because I thought
Nobody else would love me. And you know what? I grew mentally. It wasn’t easy. At all. But I became independent. I realized I didn’t need anybody. Once you learn to not need anybody, wanting someone comes easier. I know it’s hard to wait but I promise it gets better."
SuicideWatch,fnfs6v5,t3_g1dlq8,1586914352.0,It’s terrifying isn’t it? Being trapped inside your own head. I get it. I understand it. I have scars. On the inside and outside. But I pushed through. And I’m okay. It doesn’t get better over night. But it does get better. If you need to talk I’m only a message away ❤️ zero judgment. I’ll just listen and love.
SuicideWatch,fnfs19n,t3_g1focz,1586914262.0,I know how you feel. Seriously send me a message and I’ll talk to you all night if you need to. Im here for you. ❤️
SuicideWatch,fnfryfq,t3_g13lm2,1586914216.0,"I know exactly what you’re going through. It feels like an eternity of misery. Like nothing will ever change. It does get better. Not over night. But it will. I was once in your position when I was younger. I have scars. I have scars on the inside. Fast forward to three months ago, my son killed himself. He was 13. He had his entire
Life to live, and it was gone in an instant. Depression makes it easier to have a negative outlook so you don’t attach feelings. It’s easier to isolate yourself so you don’t find a reason to live. I get it. I do. But give it a bit. You didn’t come this far just to come this far. You need to talk? I’ll give you my number and you can call any time, any day. I’ll listen to you. I’ll cry with you. I’ll help you any way I can."
SuicideWatch,fnfrk7e,t3_fzt253,1586913983.0,"I will. I will grieve over you. I will cry for you. I will remember you. Please don’t do it. I’m literally just a message away and I’ll listen to any and everything, zero judgement. I’ll cry with you. Laugh with you. I’ll be there for you. You just have to give it a chance."
SuicideWatch,fnfr76g,t3_g1grqn,1586913767.0,"I’m not gonna lie. When I was with my ex fiancé I was miserable. I self harmed on my birthday. I avoid my birthdays and completely shut down. I have gotten slightly better, it just takes time. It won’t happen over night.  Things DO get better. Happy birthday. ❤️ you can message or Snapchat me if you need
To talk."
SuicideWatch,fnfqzew,t3_g1f5fv,1586913640.0,"Sometimes your brain is wired to do certain things, like self sabotage. I’m guilty of it too. Take a breath. Run your girlfriend a bath or just give her a long hug. Don’t make any decisions while you’re upset. You have to literally train your brain to think and do different things. Are you able to seek counseling or anything?"
SuicideWatch,fnfqqsu,t3_g1gtbi,1586913500.0,"I’m here for you. I will listen to everything you want to tell me. You can call me. You can Snapchat me. I’ll cry with you. I’ll laugh with you. You didn’t make it this far just to make it this far. Please message me and I’ll help any way I can with no judgement, just love. I know what it’s like being alone.

SuicideWatch,fnfqdil,t3_g1fgzp,1586913278.0,"My son who is 13 killed himself three months ago. He thought everyone would get over him and forget about him. Let me tell you, I cry myself to sleep almost every night. I can’t look at pictures of him without crying. The whole “we’ll see each other in heaven”, sure, but how many years of torment and anguish before that day happens? Depressed people usually try cut all emotions to happy things. It makes dying easier, not caring about anything. I know what you feel like. I’ve been there before. Somehow I stuck it out and I’m trying, desperately to help others avoid the same fate as my son. You are so loved. If you need someone, message me and I’ll talk to you all night if you need it. No judgment. Just love."
SuicideWatch,fnfpyob,t3_g1ejv8,1586913033.0,"I am Christian and I don’t consider suicide a sin. Nowhere does God say you will not be allowed into heaven for killing yourself. For two, if it is cancer (and I hope it’s not) it is painful as your body weakens and you are no longer independent. Its not a peaceful death in your sleep. My son killed himself three months ago. He was 13. He had his entire life and he had so, so many demons. I want you to know people care about and love you. If you need
Someone to talk to without any judgement, please message me. Hugs"
SuicideWatch,fnfpkvs,t3_g1gf9u,1586912805.0,"You are still in a grieving mode, whether you had a good relationship with him or not. That glimmer of hope is your out. Not suicide. Suicide will destroy your mom. For her to live through that again, but this time her child? She will not recover. My son who is 13 killed himself three months ago. For three months I have cried myself to sleep most nights and stopped eating for the most part. I don’t leave my house. I don’t talk to anybody. I lost a lot of my friends from isolating myself. Please sweet heart, take a good long look in the mirror and decide what you want your future to be. You are capable of making those decisions. Reach out if you need to talk without judgment. Hugs."

SuicideWatch,fnfp3wq,t3_g1gpc7,1586912525.0,"The least painful? There isn’t such a thing. Because you don’t hurt you, you hurt EVERYONE around you. I’m not being cliche. My son killed himself three months ago. I will never recover. Trust me when I say I know what you feel like. Empty. Alone. That you’ve tried to work it out but it doesn’t work. That nobody notices you. YOUR life matters. YOU are loved. If you don’t think That send me a message and I’ll give you all the love I can with zero judgment."
SuicideWatch,fnfou5x,t3_g1czpj,1586912372.0,"If you can’t do it to your family at home.. don’t to it at all. My son, my baby boy, killed himself three months ago in our home. And quite honestly it wouldn’t have mattered where it was. We are destroyed. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I cry when I look at his pictures. Holidays are the worst. His siblings scream his name and cry non-stop for him. I feel so empty I don’t even feel like a human any more. I know what you’re going through. I was once in your situation. Trust me it’s not worth it. Your parents will be in shock while picking out your casket. Your friends will wonder why they failed and why they couldn’t help you. The police will put on a brave face and go home and sob uncontrollably. For your family none of it will feel real. It’ll be a nightmare you can’t wake up from. They’ll stop eating, stop sleeping. They’ll hug your belongings and cry wondering why they failed as parents. You did not come this far just to come this far. Living life? It’s not easy. It won’t get better over night. But when that day does get here, you’ll be able to say “hey guys I made it”. Please message me if you need to talk. Hugs."
SuicideWatch,fnfnv8v,t3_g10pgr,1586911813.0,"It is a big deal. Making dinner with your family isn’t a big deal until it’s the last memory they have of you. Feeding your dog isn’t a big deal until it’s the last time you do it. My son? He is 13. He killed himself three months ago. He thought everyone would get over him and forget about him. There were over 400 people at his funeral, most of them didn’t even know us personally. You know why? Because his life mattered, just like yours matters. I can say without a doubt I know what you’re going through. I went through it when I was younger. I haven’t been able to really do anything except house stuff to keep myself distracted. I’m still in the denial stage because I know once I’m out of it I will lose it. I can’t look at pictures of him without sobbing. I’m his stepmom and I’ve been raising him for the past two years because his horribly abusive  mom lost custody of him, but I still absolutely claim and love him as my own. The sad part? We were laughing and joking that morning. In an instance he was gone. Please message me if you need to talk, I’ll welcome you with open arms and absolutely zero judgement. We all have demons."
SuicideWatch,fnfn5sm,t3_g1feu6,1586911397.0,"If I have learned anything from your post it’s that you don’t NEED anybody. You are a capable, independent person, which not a lot of people can say they are. I know it’s hard to see the bright side of things, but my son killed him self three months ago. I cannot explain the torment or anguish I am feeling, I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. Suicide is an out. You can find peace. You can find happiness. You just have to stick it out. Life isn’t easy. You didn’t come this far just to come this far. I have forced myself to get out of bed to look at posts on here to see if I can keep someone else from having the same fate as my son. You are not alone. There are support groups and hell, message me if you need to."

I miss who I was before my dad was physically abusive and I needed surgery to fix my arm. I miss who I was before my son killed himself three months ago. I can’t change what happened or go back. The only thing in my power that I can do is move forward. For me, smiling at least once a day to remind myself I still have emotions is moving forward. Not breaking down every day from the ptsd is moving forward. It has taken years. It’s not easy. I’ve had so, so many people ask me if I was “always like this”, no, I wasn’t. I WAS happy, carefree. Life happens and your innocence is taken away. Just remember you are not alone and you didn’t come this far just to come this far. Hugs. Message me if you need to"
SuicideWatch,fnabiie,t3_fzt253,1586794569.0,That’s what you think. That’s what everyone thinks. People who want to commit suicide think of the most negative thoughts so they don’t form emotional attachments. I’m a complete stranger and I care. I am desperate to help you.
SuicideWatch,fn8yo1w,t3_g09sei,1586753904.0,"Sometimes people get it in their head that suicide is the only way you can be happy. That there’s no going back. Guess what? I’m covered in tattoos I did myself. I literally tattooed myself. It’s just skin. It’s okay. My birthday two years ago was horrible, to say the least. My ex fiancé cheated on me, got drunk and screamed at me in front of everybody, drove home drunk without me, the next day he blamed it on me and wouldn’t take me out to dinner, nothing, etc. I hate my birthdays. I’m in a better place
Now, but I completely shut down on my birthday week. It is how I deal with it. And that’s okay. It’s how I deal with and process trauma to survive. Obviously there are underlying issues from my childhood but I am slowly working on those step by step. My oldest son committed suicide in January. I’m in my 20s. Let me tell you it is something I will NEVER recover from. You are loved. You are needed. Please hang in there because you didn’t come this far just to come this far."

Money won’t stop your siblings from screaming your name every night because they didn’t get a chance to say goodbye. Money isn’t why first responders do their job. It’s not about the money. Money won’t bring my son back. Money won’t help me when I’m crying hysterically curled up in the kitchen floor with his hoodie. Money won’t take those images out of my head. Please don’t do it.
