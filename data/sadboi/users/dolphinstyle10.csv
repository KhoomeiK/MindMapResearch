schizophrenia,fqee0kl,t3_ghqgqb,1589305999.0,This is genuinely hilarious and spot on!
schizophrenia,fppvspp,t1_fppu6dm,1588810125.0,Ok no need to worry! We will find an option that works for the entire group.
schizophrenia,fpptxc2,t1_fppsrit,1588809083.0,"Hi there, thanks for your interest. What would be your preference instead of Zoom?"
schizoaffective,f9d4vk5,t1_f89ebzz,1575230202.0,"Thanks for your reply. During one of my episodes, my first one, I heard an additional set of voices that were saying the opposite of what they were saying out loud. And I was listening to the inner voices rather than what was being said. This ended up with me being hospitalized. 

It’s hard to ignore the inner voices when they are loud. Thank god my voices have reduced in volume with treatment and medication."
schizoaffective,f9cyc99,t3_e4by7u,1575228430.0,That’s awesome. Nice to hear that!!
schizoaffective,f890ynm,t3_dz9o72,1574365041.0,"I have a problem with motivation too. I actually got a job teaching English online but I haven’t started yet. I had an episode soon after I was accepted so I asked to postpone my training to give myself time to reacclimate. 

To be honest I’ve been really unmotivated in the mornings. I start feeling myself in the evenings around 5 or so. So maybe just go with the rhythm of things and try to find the time of day that you feel the best and aim to accomplish what you want during those times."
schizoaffective,f88zw5u,t1_f8836u2,1574364497.0,"I felt clear for like 2 days but then I couldn’t sleep on the 3rd night and crashed and became extremely emotional, crying and whatnot. Out of control. And extremely restless. So I went back on the meds. I think I needed to experience that to understand it’s probably not best for me to drop my meds like that."
schizoaffective,f88zl83,t1_f8836u2,1574364347.0,Agreed.
schizoaffective,f86yup1,t1_f86fugv,1574310510.0,That happens to me too
