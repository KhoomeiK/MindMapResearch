Adulting,fpmqab0,t3_ge6876,1588738947.0,"Hey there, 

I was homeschooled most of my life and don’t have a high school diploma, however: 

I started taking college classes when I was 15 as a non matriculated student. This wasn’t part of a high school program or anything. Literally just college classes. When I gained enough credits, I was able to apply as a part time student and take more credits per semester after being accepted. 


After three years of that, I transferred schools and later graduated from an art and design college where I studied animation. They never knew I didn’t go to high school. Most of my homeschooling experience was math and writing. I worked in the animation field for a few years now  and run my own company. 

Don’t stress about your homeschooling experience. You’re capable of anything you set your mind to. If you want to go get your GED, go get it! Hope this gave you some inspiration."
