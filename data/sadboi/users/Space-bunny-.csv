BPD,fh714vm,t1_fh6zqrd,1581311624.0,"We have a daughter and for most of her life I was working except for the first six weeks . But he hasn‚Äôt had a steady job despite 4 months in the whole 2 and a half years she‚Äôs been born . A job never lasted more than two weeks and there wasn‚Äôt very many. He takes care of her but doesn‚Äôt clean much , has to be told repeatedly to do things like laundry or another chore . He is a good cook and cooks most of our meals I‚Äôll give him that haha . I know he loves me and I care for him deeply I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs love all the time . I feel like I‚Äôm more so scared of change and being comfortable also what will happen to the both of us as I rely on him for childcare because my parents should not be watching children nor would they want to anyway . And he relays on me for financial support , he doesn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go . We both are the black sheep of our family. This guy is caring , gives me compliments, has a steady career is established, good looking , seems to really care . Not that my bf some of those things but I feel like over the years and with the mistakes he has also it made it has some how devalued the relationship in a way . Like it could never be the way it was before ?"

You should really reevaluate if u want to be in a relationship with a girl who is on her second baby because newborns are a trip. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to handle two children , I have a two year old son and I just about lost it. Multiple times where I would dissociate and lose grasp of reality. But I have a partner who would never agree with that statement. And I know for a fact I am being taught how to Adult , manage and cope by him. But he would never say it‚Äôs a burden. That‚Äôs just odd , don‚Äôt stand by that stand up for yourself. You two need an understanding that one your not a burden and two who cares if she is helping you cope? Who cares if father was hurt that‚Äôs his kid anyway. Gosh I‚Äôm so upset for u. I‚Äôm sorry if u don‚Äôt feel this way and I sound like a jackass"
