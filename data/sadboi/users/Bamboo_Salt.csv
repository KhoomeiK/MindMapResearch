Anxiety,ethljzo,t3_cbl40t,1562819153.0,"Ugh I have a simular problem. What found has worked for me is taking a cool shower before bed, keeping a reusable water bottle in the fridge to drink from, and eating cold meals."
Anxiety,ethlf7x,t3_cbn5zd,1562819030.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way. I would first, see if your college has a withdraw option for compelling circumstances, or at least that's what my university defines it as. That way your academic record doesn't take too hard of a blow."
Anxiety,ethl27y,t3_cbp75c,1562818701.0,I think I do but I wasn't entirely sure it was a thing. Now I feel less silly about it!
Anxiety,esrlev0,t3_c8z4pq,1562228671.0,"Congratulations! You'll be busy with your hands I imagine, so that'll probably help keep you distracted. Good luck!"

Anxiety,eqk58eq,t3_byhsfi,1560116361.0,I'm so sorry! Have you tried taking a shower before bed? That usually helps me when I'm too anxious to fall asleep.
Anxiety,eqk50s0,t3_bykta3,1560116272.0,"Yup. I go through periods of time where everything gives me anxiety from going out in public, fears of vomiting, being watched, etc. My medication helps but boy does it suck. Currently searching for a new therapist to help get me back on track. You're definitely not alone."
