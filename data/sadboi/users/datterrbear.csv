SuicideWatch,f465v1n,t1_f45vx36,1571404519.0,"Idk .. u tell me if the negatives really outweigh thr positives ... cuz i think they. Its not like I try to live life focusing on the negative aspects .. hell no ... i obviously know if thats all i focus on thats all imma see.. but even when im trying to distract myself and move on .. it just keeps coming back. 

And by help... do u mean therapy? Cuz therapy=money ......."
SuicideWatch,f453ixb,t1_f44nx0d,1571365198.0,I feel like i did try tho. My entire life i feel like I've been trying to find myself ... and honestly ill admit it .. i failed... i still dont know if i know who I am. And in regards to ur second block ... i dont know or think its worth it ... to me the negatives outweigh the positives and i just don't see things ever getting better. And of course there are things that make me happy ... its just not enough the null the pain. Im just not strong enough of a person i guess.
SuicideWatch,f44lr0a,t1_f44l9i6,1571354767.0,You know what? I used to but i took it all down so i can gain more experience and really put up something that reflects my understanding of photography.  Sorry

PhotographyProTips,f3yz28l,t1_f3w9zv1,1571261105.0,"Ok thank you so much. I will definitely take my limits at the moment and time management into consideration! It is a little weird for me to be a bit bossy for my photos because I usually go for candids and there will be at least one more, more experienced photographer on the scene .. and im kinda hoping he'll take care of it. But absolutely! My sincere thanks."

PhotographyProTips,f3vr6h0,t1_f3vqfga,1571182807.0,"Yes! I will absolutely be going in with that in mind! As an artist (or for me at least) it is sometimes hard to fight the urge to find a shot that I'll be satisfied with and that usually leads to me doing something out of the box for a shot, but I do absolutely agree with what you said and I shall fight that urge! Haha. My sincere thanks for the advice."
