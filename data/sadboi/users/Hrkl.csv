CommunismWorldwide,fonyjqi,t3_g8fcnh,1587929004.0,"I think ‚Äúincentive for work‚Äù or even ‚Äúwork‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be the right way to consider your life‚Äôs work and drive. All the means for comfortable survival would be available to you, all information would be shared and enjoyed (like how to build your own house, farm, if you want a more rustic life. Cities would also exist in communism but they would be cool sustainable cities, not the capitalist pigpens they are today.), so you would work in a trade or profession that you have genuine passion for. Your work would not dictate your survival. You would work because you love what you do, you love other people, you want to help your community flourish however it can. That is your incentive. Will you be paid? Well, I‚Äôm no economist, but probably somehow. I believe all work is essential and do not believe there should be socioeconomic differences between ‚Äúlow skill‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh skill‚Äù work; all work requires great skill and is necessary. 
As for the issue of justice and punishment or whatever, we require a radical transformative reevaluation and deconstruction of how we perceive criminal justice today. Fuck prisons, police, most courts of law. We must build rehabilitation centers, not prisons. I am a firm believer that any ‚Äúcrime‚Äù rate would plummet incredibly once everyone has equal opportunity and access to a fulfilling safe life. The maniacally evil construction of criminal justice today is a disgusting joke."
CommunismWorldwide,fonvvfx,t3_g8fcnh,1587927489.0,"From how I understand it ‚Äî 
The general progression would be capitalism ‚Äî> socialism ‚Äî> communism. During the socialist period would be where the foundations to the communist world would be built ‚Äî abolition of discrimination, prisons, borders, police, the neoliberal market system, class, etc. A centralised government led by the working class would take over the means of production and properly distribute and allocate our beautiful world‚Äôs resources so that everyone has housing, food, water, clothing, healthcare, education, employment, community. (Scarcity is a capitalist fearmongering myth and the world certainly can provide for us all, as long as no one as exorbitant opulent dreams of material wealth, which they shouldn‚Äôt anyways thinking of the well-being of others.) Once this is established, the socialist state would fade away, leaving behind borderless, small local communities across the world. The most significant industries of society ‚Äî the sciences and tech, the arts, etc ‚Äî would be carried out freely for the betterment of all humankind, not for the acquisition of wealth. People would be guaranteed means to live and choose an arts/science occupation and they would work because they love what they do, are good at it, and want to help their community, which is the best reason to work at all. Money would have token value, not the value it has today. The economy, as long as it lasts, would be planned, in 5 or 10 year segments. Trade would freely occur between communities. People would learn, work, travel, exist in peace and fulfilled potentials. The sick, deranged, suffocating white supremacist system of capital, which constricts and contorts our values and joy of life, would finally be destroyed. We would have no laws or god but the desire to take care of ourselves and another. Human nature is infinitely mutable, we are not inherently selfish or chaotic. We could become a smoothly functioning people with ample resources and opportunities."
depressed,fontya0,t3_g8cum8,1587926405.0,"I completely agree. Wealth is of monumental significance ‚Äî access to treatment, rest, etc ‚Äî and in the socioeconomic sense celebrities would never understand the tragedies of being poor and depressed. They should check their privilege hard before attempting to speak about such sensitive topics."

ballpython,fmuq515,t3_fxj9yd,1586396481.0,"Hi everyone, I hope you and your bps are safe and well. 
I‚Äôve had my bp for almost a year now (got her last June). When I bought her, I was told that she was young, but I never found out how young. 
My snake is about 28 inches long, 386 g in weight now.  
I feed her (large mouse) once a week. 
I feel as though... if she is over a year old, she should be much larger by now? I feed her consistently and was wondering if anyone could offer a second opinion on the matter? Thanks so much."
TrueOffMyChest,fmibg8o,t3_fv5ptm,1586106237.0,"You make such a salient point. I don‚Äôt believe that society should enforce any rigid standards of living onto people (apart from being kind to each other, not harming each other, cooperation, etc), but the society we live in disproportionately awards productivity, extroversion and financial/status/clout-related achievement over EVERYTHING. To be respected, you‚Äôre expected to be constantly active and productive and social, and constantly achieving in socially-encouraged ways: expanding your business, making side hustles, consuming lots of material items, getting to know a lot of people. 

That‚Äôs only one way of living. (It is also killing our environment and putting great strain on society.) instead, there must be more value placed on introversion, quietude, appreciating nature, living a life simple in material wealth yet rich in spiritual, mental, and intimate social wealth. And more value placed in a plurality of values to live by. 

My ultimate dream is to live in a peaceful, kind world, where I have my house and my career, my cats and my plants and my closest friends and family, tending to my vegetable garden, fishing, taking care of my home and my community. I have no aspirations to climb a fake success ladder. I seek fulfillment from wholesome things! 

Thanks for posting such a crucial point!"
Iamactuallyverybadass,fko5w0v,t1_fkmzy7q,1584380719.0,"Do any of you numbskulls ever consider WHY there is such proliferation of Sinophobic Anti-China rhetoric rife in Western news outlets? The US has NEVER wished to see China succeed because China is socialist threat, an economic threat, a clear example that pursuing a less rigorous capitalist system HOLDS GOOD RESULTS: better healthcare, housing, crisis prevention and crisis response, etc. For those who say China isn‚Äôt socialist: they are AS SOCIALIST AS THEY CAN BE under a pressing capitalist world. So when you hear about Muslim extermination, dog eating, exotic animal eating, ask kind of sinophobic propaganda, ask yourself, why is EVERY KIND OF MEDIA AROUND ME SO ANTI-CHINA? The US has strategic interest in keeping its citizens sinophobic. That means a lot of this info isn‚Äôt true. I‚Äôd love to send sources and discuss how the rehabilitation centers for some Uighyurs are humane and peaceful and NOTHING like the news you see online, where many people are being PAID to say exactly what the US media want them to. But for now, I‚Äôll just leave saying that this ceaseless sinophobia is ungrounded, racist as hell, and hurts so many. Don‚Äôt believe every opinion about foreign affairs from a US perspective is accurate, because it‚Äôs not."

Looking good! Being clean! Fuck this. I think that showering a few times a week, brushing your teeth and washing your face and at least applying moisturiser and sunscreen on your face and maybe some body lotion on your bod is a priority. I stress that those tasks should become a routine if possible. But everything else... when you‚Äôre poor and depressed and couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck, you end up looking pretty drab. I think that‚Äôs fine. As long as you‚Äôre caring for your hygiene, who tf cares. Your style will reemerge when your mind heals.

SuicideWatch,fj8htt8,t1_fj8ckgn,1583113737.0,You‚Äôre so right. It‚Äôs a benevolent act AND it ends our own suffering. It‚Äôs absolutely cruel to force people who are suicidal to use wild arduous painful means to move on.

It is repulsive. I, too, do not wish for anyone to have to clean up my splattered remains anywhere and would like a cleaner and tranquil way to go. I hope you stay alive and fight on and carry out the fucking inevitable revolution. All I know is that it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault if people don‚Äôt make it and want to leave this cursed world earlier.

SuicideWatch,fj8h9jj,t1_fj8bqbl,1583113362.0,"Honestly I cannot agree with you more. Reading your words instilled in me some vague form of solidarity and comfort, because I too am so disgusted by our society, and how so much of our society‚Äôs depression and anxiety could be cured by changing the structures of all our institutions, particularly our godforsaken economy. We humans could have created any world we wanted, one that could care for and support each and every one of us, yet we created one that would protect the interests of the 0.01% and let everyone else die and fall through the cracks. America is an absolute hellhole, an illegitimate state, a country that has shot down every other country‚Äôs fight for liberation just to preserve its parasitic capitalism and upper class. FUCK THIS PLACE! The only thing keeping me alive is probably the seething fiery hatred for our current world and searing adoration for a better, equal, safe and peaceful world.

The prevailing ideas we hold about mental health are not holistic or accurate or long-term successful at all, I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôre meant to briefly satiate you and have you on your way instead of evaluating your values and helping you lead a fulfilling life in alignment with them... as for assisted suicide I figure that if people are going to kill themselves regardless, it‚Äôs so worth it to give them a means of completing their desires in a more peaceful way. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt have to be easy to achieve, but it should exist... this world is so cruel, and people should not have to suffer for so long"

SuicideWatch,fj7wwhl,t1_fj7w0v9,1583100052.0,"Yeah, exactly.
