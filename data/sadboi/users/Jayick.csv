I just got steam rolled so hard I'll probably never recover mentally. I dated a girl who was heavily abused, she went into a battered woman's shelter to escape her ex.

Both of their entire families want me to report them to dcyf and get the children removed from her care...

I wish I met someone like you. I wish I met someone who cared. I wish I met someone who tried to fix the problem rather then throwing it away. And I'm sure you're right there with me, wishing you met someone like yourself also. But sadly, you and I, we are a rare kind in this world. 

I hope you find everything you're looking for in life. I hope and pray you find someone amazing to treat you right and the kids.

AskMen,fm8uzfq,t3_ftm55b,1585856520.0,"Pretty awful. Stress level is through the roof. 

Girlfriend ex is a psychopath. Got arrested like 4 times, state won't hold him on no bail. Everything from crack to domestic violence to DUI to assault, still won't give him more then a 40$ bail and a ride to the station for a few hours. He beat and raped her the entire start of our relationship.

Got so bad we had to place her and the kids into a battered woman's shelter. Supposed to be until his court dates in May.... Now end of times, courts postponed all his court dates with a TBD future date. So now he's running around thinking he's gotten off on all charges. 

So far he's shown up there twice demanding to see the kids. Yep guy shows up to a battered woman's shelter to pick a fight with her. Police won't do much about it. My contact with her is next to none. I got to see her today for about 15 minutes for the first time in a week and a half.

It's hell. It's misery. Ontop of that we were looking to move in together come July. Now I've lost all my clients and completely out of work. I'm self employed right now so hits extra hard. Landlord doesn't give a fuck about what's happening, starting fining everyone early this month if rent wasn't in on time (normally 6th late fees kick in, this month it's 2nd they started, with 6th being start of eviction process if they didn't get it instead of 15th).

Life is fucking fun!"

Real or not the damage will be done far before they can run damage control, you nuke the image of the HOA and the person who runs it.

Nearly all HOAs are horse shit. Anyone who runs one deserves their lives ruined."
ActualPublicFreakouts,fm68abj,t1_fm67lua,1585788413.0,"Old guard boomers running corruption outside of direct politics? You don't say!

Dude people are going to say and do stupid shit in every career field out there. Just like the idiot kid spitting in burgers because it's funny, some guy out there with a gun and badge is calling teenagers niggers just because he can. Not new in the world, and not justification to ""hate all cops"". I don't hate every dunkies employee because one that one anti cop employee spit in my coffee. No, I just reported them and moved on. You know what happened? They landed a job at dunks 2 towns over. 

Ain't no Justice in this world my friend. Be thankful you didn't become a cop because it crushes your soul and you can't help the way you want. I too once thought like you, and it screams of optimism. Unfortunately I've been beaten down by reality. Reality is, shit ain't going to change so long as unions pull the strings. Private insurance all the way. Just like a 1099 worker, go out and get your own insurance. Then companies would drop cops like flys when they fuck around and have tighter rules, rather then back them with a dream team of lawyers that'll make Oj cum his pants."
ActualPublicFreakouts,fm635sk,t1_fm62gaq,1585785293.0,"Left the force because the cops aren't the issue. It's the unions. 

Unions protect shitty cops. They also prevent us from speaking out against said shitty cops. Speak up and the union drops you like a hot tomato. Most cases take 15 months. That's 15 months with no job. Because the union gives us all our insurances and benefits, along with liability insurances. So 15 months without any insurance or income, on the off chance the legal system DOESNT let us down again?

And you expect someone to give this up because you are irrational and instantly say ""all cops are bastards"" and get offended when someone tells you to fuck off? Sounds to me like your irrational in real life as well. So why would anyone risk anything in their personal life to come to your side? 

Start the conversation civilly and I'd be singing a different tune. Your problem isn't cops. Your problem is lack of understanding how the public sector functions in local government. Please do some research and stop supporting unions."

Go after the unions. We hate them as much as you do, and they do nothing but shift shitty cops from station to station.

Anyone wondering, acab=all cops are bastards. We got us a little anti cop edgelord over here that would call us up crying in a heartbeat if his ass every got whooped."

relationship_advice,flxaagb,t1_flx5mkk,1585578804.0,"Go ahead and pop off the LCP and tell me it's easy to grip in your hands. Even with the extended round mag it's still a bitch. Chances are one of your thumbs is going behind the slide if you're a new user, and your dropping that shit like a hot potato after you jam your thumb. Or you get spooked by the recoil and loosen your grip.

Compact guns have heavy recoils. Most women would buy a compact for protection. They're not rocking a 3.5* barrel gun dude.

As for ""do I own guns"", uh yes. Lots. It's kinda ""my thing"", and I've used them to even create videogame mods for the subreddit I moderate. 

And I agree, it's shit advice. Go to a CCW class and get trained. But you know what? There kinda isn't a CCW class going on right now, or for the near future. We are talking home defense weapon, not carrying in public. She doesn't need a CCW permit, just a nics background check and whatever her state requires. 

We are talking about an immediate situation that requires attention. It's prone to escalate to something abusive very quick. Everyone saying go to the cops, that's great advice, but not at this very current moment in America and most of the world. Reality check, but you are not special. You getting raped and beaten doesn't mean we respond any faster. If I have a crackhead in the back of my car I gotta deal with his shit first, I can't just drop him off like Superman on the side of the road and rush to save you. 

Reality is no one is coming soon. No punishment will happen from this before the summer months. Any contact with police just puts her life in risk. This is a fucked up time legally for everyone. You are not answering for your crimes for quite a while in most states right now.

So what advice should I give? Go to the cops hunny, it's ok. When nothing comes of it he's only going to start beating you? That's shit advice dude, and you know it. Run away? That works, but she said she knows no one besides coworkers. Maybe one of them can help, but she doesn't seem ready to put her pride aside and ask strangers for help yet IRL. So what alternative? Use a knife? Shit hurts, but you'd be surprised how hard it is to kill someone with a knife. Every knife fight I've seen both parties get stabbed. Unless it's a one-off shank kinda deal? Nope, DVs most cases both people get hurt. So what's left? Something that is very fucking loud and intimidating. A firearm. Now we have a lack of classes and training provided, and probably no range to practice with it. So what's the alternative? Carry a single round and use it as a tool of intimidation if need be, not a weapon to kill someone. That's the purpose of my advice. A very loud and dangerous way to let everyone in the fucking area know ""I need help NOW"". LOUDER then any scream she can muster.

Shit advice as far as gun safety goes. Not shit advice to save her life."
