I couldn't play for a long time because playing video games was linked in my brain with alcohol and cocaine. My daughter and wife are softcore gamers and they don't play games I like so it hasn't been a problem to see them play and wanting to play myself.

Anyway long story short we went shopping for a new set of joy con for her Switch and we saw a pile of 2hand games. I took 3 ps4 games for 9€. Pretty old games but I like them. I played an hour and a half yesterday night. I really enjoyed it like when I was a kid. No thoughts at all of wanting to get high. 10/10 will play again tonight"

brussels,fpqhwh3,t1_fpqbm5o,1588823180.0,"It's not really a matter of socioeconomics in this case. Of course some of them are on the poorer side but certainly not all of them. For me it's more a matter of youth. With youth comes exuberance and stupidity. The perfect cocktail for clashes with law enforcement during the quarantine. Also the police in Brussels is not good. Most of the cops don't come from Brussels, don't live in Brussels and don't know Brussels which leads to tensions. Also some of them are politicized on the far right spectrum, it's not a secret. Race profiling is more than a thing and I don't say this for brownie point. I've seen it countless times in 4 decades.

Don't jump to conclusions. We can discuss some things we encountered in Brussels without being called a racist the minute we desagree. Let's chat and find out what people mean first"

I get that you want to show off your doctorate (because it's an accomplishment you should be proud of) but don't ask people to refer to you as doctor if you're not a fucking medical doctor, because that's some honorific bs that make look presomptuous and sometimes misleading.

I don't want people with Phd's to drop dead in reality. That was sarcastic if you will. A figure of speech. Do you never exaggerate when you speak to convey your feelings?"
