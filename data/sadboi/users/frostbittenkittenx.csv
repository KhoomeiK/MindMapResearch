autism,fclmvul,t1_fbk3j99,1577751528.0,"I was 20 when I was diagnosed (it's been a few years now) and I had a whole bunch of similar questions. It is scary but I do think you'll come to terms with it. There's so many ways to connect with peers - even if it's a bit more difficult for you, it's not impossible. You're not alone! Knowing will help you understand yourself more I think."
autism,fclmkps,t1_fbjo2ng,1577751317.0,"I think I probably had a similar way of thinking about the label at first. I really didn't want it, despite it being suggested to me. I guess it doesn't really change who you are, right? It just helps you make sense of who you are. I've had so many ohhhhh! Moments too haha.  

By the sounds of it, it's the boss that's the problem. I'm glad you can can tell yourself that and find comfort in it. Maybe seeking a different job if that's possible would be a positive thing."
autism,fclm7l5,t1_fbic30y,1577751067.0,It's a shame they didn't tell you sooner. I hope you will be able to come to terms with it - it might take some time but don't rush yourself.
autism,fclm3z1,t1_fbi6ggo,1577750997.0,"Haha, aw. I guess mine sucked before and after too, yeah. But in some ways it improved - I guess with relationships with others? Just in that there was a bit more understanding, I wasn't just weird, there was a reason behind it."
autism,fcllw0l,t1_fbixbi0,1577750843.0,"Ah, I'm sorry. That sounds like a really exhausting situation to be in. It sounds like the diagnosis for you was helpful for understanding yourself, but if only it came sooner... I think I feel the same, personally. I hope that it doesn't wind up with you burning out.  Thank you for sharing your experience."
autism,fclkzr1,t1_fbibej2,1577750236.0,"It makes complete sense. I think we're pretty similar in that way, actually. I think getting diagnosed was both a blessing and a curse for that reason... helps me understand myself more, but also giving me an extra reason to beat myself up about my mistakes or quirks. I can relate with the isolation, too. You're only a few years younger than me!

You're right that it might not have changed much to get diagnosed sooner. I only knew one person with autism in school, but he got a lot support and treatment. I guess knowing that makes me wonder if things could've been different. There's probably not much point lingering on the past, right? Are you and your brother close?

That's very sweet of you üíú Nice to talk to someone else autistic who isn't my BF haha"

GriefSupport,fbhz7wb,t3_edbo4x,1576886282.0,Yes. My dad passed away May last year but I've only really started the grieving process in the past few months. I think this time of year brings out a lot of feelings and memories. I'm sorry for your loss.

It's okay to not be ready yet. That's true. :)"
GriefSupport,fb6ajnh,t3_ebmnqh,1576545511.0,"I am so sorry for your loss.

My dad passed away last year and I did a speech at his funeral. I was incredibly anxious about it, and it stressed me out, but I don't regret it at all. However, I would say don't force yourself to do it. Maybe write something down in case you feel able to, but don't force anything. The pastor would be able to read it out if it feels like too much. Losing your dad is so hard and you need to listen to yourself and do what's right by you to be able to get yourself through such a hard time.

Take one day at a time. A big hug to you."
