I've been depressed since grade school. I first watched Bojack in college and saw a lot of myself in him. I used alcohol as a crutch, blacking out 4-5 times a week at my worst, and was generally shitty to those I was close with. I watched it as a senior in college and it gave me an outside perspective of how my actions effect others and to quote Cuddly Whiskers, how ""it doesn't have to be that way.""

Today, I have no more than 2 drinks on the rare occasion I do drink (don't even crave alcohol anymore) and I actively try to be supportive of those around me. I have not tried therapy (although I know I still should, as I still have problems), but I was able to get rid of a lot of toxic behavior and I largely thank the show for giving me the perspective to kick me to make these changes."
