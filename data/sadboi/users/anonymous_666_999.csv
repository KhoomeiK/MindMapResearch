SuicideWatch,fohzjt7,t1_fohy6fe,1587775700.0,Iâ€™ve seen quite a few doctors and Iâ€™ve seen a neurologist and Iâ€™m currently seeing a headache specialist but if this doesnâ€™t work I will have to go to Chicago Illinois which is where pretty much the Mayo Clinic of headaches and migraines is so weâ€™ll see what happensðŸ˜–
SuicideWatch,foeo3xk,t3_g6fbu3,1587709204.0,Iâ€™ve had a headache 66 weeks thatâ€™s just constant. No medicine takes it away. Iâ€™m so sick of hearing people say itâ€™ll go away soon it could last forever itâ€™s been over a year
