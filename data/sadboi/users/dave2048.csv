Instead, my body was plugged directly into the earth. I could feel it ringing like a bell. Each earthly pulse caused my body to shudder in ecstasy. My body was turned inside out, and, before my head returned to me, my skull was scraped clean with a shovel. My eyes weren‚Äôt working, but I could still see.
