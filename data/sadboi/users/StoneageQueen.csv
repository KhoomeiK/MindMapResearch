dogs,fr6e0oq,t3_gmv7p0,1589924553.0,My husband and I are child free but my sister has 3 children and their family loves to watch our dog. He stays at their house when we travel but sometimes they just miss him and ask if he can stay a few nights. Maybe a couple times a year. My dog adores their family and I see no problem with it. He is happy and well taken care of when he visits. If your dog isn't in distress I don't see any harm.

ACL,fpwjm5b,t3_gfvek8,1588964602.0,"Missed a step coming down a ladder and fell probably 3ish feet, landed on my left foot and felt like my knee dislocated. Strangest thing is I had no pain and very little swelling. But it immediately felt unstable especially when pivoting."

galaxys10,fk2fpph,t3_fg1oez,1583800038.0,I just got an awesome deal on the s10 at AT&T! $750 with a $300 credit when I traded in my s8 (with a cracked screen). The phone was still in great condition I only upgraded since I didn't think it would be worth it to repair the screen.

ACL,f511l20,t3_dlo1ej,1571935956.0,I had a patellar graft. I had a lot of stiffness and the limp probably went away completely somewhere between 3 and 4 months.

ACL,f0d5x3i,t3_d49rgz,1568549808.0,"I didn't have a sports related injury. I lost my balance climbing down a ladder and landed awkwardly on my left foot and felt a pop and my knee was immediately unstable. I beat myself up over it for awhile for not being more careful, in a way I feel like the injury was preventable but at the same time it was certainly an accident."
ACL,ezu32v7,t3_d29ven,1568144438.0,Congrats! What type of graft did you get? I am 11 weeks post op patellar autograft and my knee still feels weird when I walk off and on. I have moments where it feels normal but it doesn't last more than a few hours. I'm still getting a lot of stiffness. Best of luck to you!
ACL,ezaariy,t1_eza8cql,1567797892.0,Yes a pulling sensation sometimes! It makes me worried the graft was not placed at the right a angle or something. I'm not unstable just feels odd and distracting when I'm trying to walk and enjoy moving and being outside. Thanks for sharing!
candlemaking,exkpdze,t1_exkl8ky,1566395806.0,Thanks so much for your feedback! All my tops were smooth initially and the cold and hot throw are good. I will stick with 464.

ACL,ew4n8ub,t3_cmfd6i,1565114213.0,"6 weeks post op. I have had two or three moments where it felt like my knee sort of buckled or wobbled unnaturally. I have chalked it up to weak muscles, swelling and maybe moving a little too fast. If you're experiencing that a lot you may want to mention it to your doctor."
ACL,evr75hk,t1_evr2znb,1564702637.0,"This gives me so much hope! After my injury I reflected back on my travels (I spent two weeks in Europe too in 2016) and wondered if I would ever be able to be adventurous and do all the walking like I did then. I love exploring and visiting new places. I actually injured myself the week after I returned from New Orleans where I walked 8ish miles every day. Any tips or tricks you recommend for recovery? My doctor says I'm doing really well and I'm super excited to be ramping up PT next week. I've been cleared for swimming, the stationary bike and elliptical so I think I'm going to sign up for a gym membership this weekend."
ACL,evq6oio,t3_cksl3j,1564687470.0,Congrats on the achievement! Which type of graft do you have? I can't wait to get back to traveling adventures. I'm 5 weeks post op patellar autograft. I just got cleared to lose the brace so I am very happy about that.

ACL,ev0otcn,t3_ci0n2f,1564143494.0,This happened to me too for a couple weeks. Not enough pain to take a Tylenol so I just iced instead. The ice would help the annoying pain subside so I could get back to sleep.
dogs,es90taq,t1_es7exf6,1561723582.0,I have been feeding my dog Fromm as well. I immediately ordered a bag of Hills Science Diet after seeing this. My sister's dog eats Hills and they like to share food when they visit each other so I know my dog will do well on it. Thank you to the OP for sharing this information. I love my dog so much and would never want to jeopardize his health with what I am feeding him.
