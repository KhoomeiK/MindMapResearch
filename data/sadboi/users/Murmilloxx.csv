lonely,eyo4jlh,t3_cxwzh5,1567269551.0,"Hey i can relate so much to ur situation and childhood, but i also have no social skills so i dont know what to say. Im always alone, feeling like an alien or something. I want to connect with others and have a social life but deep down i know that i dont belong on this planet and that no matter how hard i try and no matter how much outside things or attention i would get i would always feel the same emptiness the next day. I cant expect anyone to fully understand me or love me, that would just take A LOT for the other person. Guess if childhood broke someone, there is no comevack. On the surface my life looks good though, nice fassade. 
Sorry for the sadness in this comment, im pretty lonely and depressed right now."
