Last I tried to watch it I was horrified and asked the people around me how are they ok with anything that goes on there - the jokes about how women just complain all the time and are used as an object and everything to do with ""nice guys"". They just didn't see it. Honourable mentions are the guy from 2 and a half men and Ross from friends. I dislike them so much.."
ptsd,fi6dosn,t3_f6ia4u,1582189772.0,"I was in an abusive relationship for over a year and a half 2 years ago. A few months ago i told my parents, they didn't take it well. 
Ever since then I get yelled at when I have panic attacks when I'm back home and when I point out to them the ways they hurt me. I always feel guilty that I'm not a good enough daughter for them, that I'm lazy and inconsiderate and that it's my fault my trauma happened. 
A week ago after another fight with my dad, I stood my ground and told him his behaviour hurts me. And, even after being yelled at I didn't have a mental breakdown and I don't blame myself that I'm not good enough, I just feel sorry for him that for whatever reason he couldn't find in his heart the compassion to help his daughter."

ptsd,f9y1pdq,t3_e78lc7,1575721980.0,"I think I'm very lucky because all the people I opened up to believed me. But the reactions varied. A couple of friends took it really lighty - saying other people have it worst and they still don't understand my story and situation at all. 
One other friend also shared her bad experience and it brought us closer. 
My mom and my SO are my two rocks but it took me a lot of time to tell them more than just something really bad happened to me. I must say tho at the start both of them took it really badly, I could see it took a toll on them which was what I was afraid of and I feel super guilty about it still. 
Although a bunch of people already know I'm still extremely cautious of who I tell it to, I'm scared they won't believe me, judge me or be scared of me. It sometimes easier just saying I suffer from depression (although it also has stigma surrounding it). 
If you're not super close with these people I wouldn't recommend sharing things with them or at least not all of it. The bad isn't worth the risk unless it's people you plan on sharing your life with."

relationship_advice,f0ezekc,t3_d4fdms,1568575755.0,"I know it's all scary and overwhelming, you and your husband must have a long past together and at least some good memories and having a bunch of internet strangers telling you otherwise must be so difficult. 
But I think you made a pretty brave step reaching for help cuz you felt something is rotten there. 
It doesn't matter how many people are telling you to leave him, it's your fight to fight and I can only be here holding your hand from a far. But from my experience is something you need to do, if not for you then for future you. Can you see yourself in the future with this man? Him stepping on all of your boundaries, leaving you empty and with no ability to fight? Maybe all of your coworkers will see your body or your family - do you want that? If it happened once it will happen again. Trust me. 
My advice to you is to get away, go be with family and friends and think about your future. Make a list of all things that he did that might be a bit odd or made you furious and read them aloud. 
Good luck"

ptsd,eutxiwm,t3_ches1n,1564033422.0,"I know how you feel - I'm going thru the same thing right now. 
Do you have anybody that you trust and cares about you? I know it feels terrible but it's time like this it is ok to ask for help! Even somebody that you don't usually confide in - Maybe give a chance to somebody to surprise you. If not a friend then a family member. 
Maybe with them it won't be so scary to get out of bed, maybe make food together or watch a movie. 
Also if it's not too difficult maybe try making a phone call to a psychologist or one of the support lines.
People on Reddit are here to support you but are in no way professional and I highly recommend seeking professional help before it gets much worst..
Continue fighting :)"

ptsd,etmaco8,t3_ccaew4,1562955517.0,"I know how you feel. 
I had a friend that I knew for years and was the first person I opened up to about what I went thru, and when I needed her the most - she wasn't there. I guess I didn't forgive her.. not sure I ever will tbh. 

For the longest time I believed that people are not a permanent part of your life, that they come and go and if you open up to them they will leave. I learned that this way you only end up alone.. but I also learned the pain of opening up and counting on someone and then being let down. 

To tell you the truth? I'm not sure what I believe in anymore. If opening up is worth it and if my trauma should be a determining factor in choosing my friends. But keeping people around you is so important for your health. For me, it's my mom (I only discovered that when I hit rock bottom and lost all of my friends in the process). And I try very hard to at least maintain some sort of connection with a bunch of people (including the previously good friend I mentioned) so I won't have the feeling of waking up to a phone with no notifications.

The fact that you have it in you to reach out and ask for help, is so brave. You are stronger than you think and the reason you need to ask for help is not your fault. 

I hope that we both eventually find people that we will feel safe with."
ptsd,etc5lbi,t3_cazkfp,1562676029.0,"I am so sorry. I know how you feel, it happened to me too.
Try to find comfort from knowing you have your parents to protect you in case it happeneds again and that he has no power anymore, at least not in your house. 
I really hope it will get better soon and you'll find your safe place."
ptsd,esykudk,t3_c9ha5t,1562344943.0,"Hi, I doubt I can help much, just wanted to let you know you're not alone feeling the way you do. I'm in a very similar situation, both trauma wise and the way my boyfriend can be with 0 emotional understanding. 
I had my fair share of feeling guilty for dragging him into the whole thing and feeling like I'm overreacting whenever something like that comes up, It used to just end up in fights as well.  
The things I'm trying to do are:
Personally, focus on fighting my trauma and trying to improve myself and remember that it's a disease like any other. That my reaction is a symptom and what I'm feeling is valid. 
And relationship wise, trying to talk to him as much as I can. Just bring up ""heavy"" conversations even when it feels like it's not the right time. Explain to him as much as you can and encourage him to find out more about what you're going thru. 

One more thing in a bit of a sad note - you need somebody that can support you especially mentally, and if you feel you tried your best and still feel that emptiness and disappointed you might want to consider walking out. He can be a great guy, but maybe not for you. 

Either way, I hope you'll find somebody that can be there for you and that you'll continue being strong (I couldn't get thru game of thrones lol) :)"
Advice,esxx0lk,t3_c9e9dx,1562336290.0,"I'm gonna start of with 2 very important things:
1. Please remember that whatever you're feeling is VALID. 
2. People that are not good for you do not deserve to stay in your life. 

Sex has a psychological layer in addition to the physical one, from what I can tell you're trying to find a quick fix or some kind of a step by step plan for a problem a bit bigger than it looks. 
I believe what you're doing is finding a way to justify or dismiss what these 2 people did you you, maybe because it's easier to deal with. But it's only a temporary solution. Especially if you're keeping the person that did you harm around you, from my experience it will come back to hunt you later on. 
Try looking at it as a psychological problem, give yourself the permission to feel bad for what happened to you without trying to cover it up. 
Maybe try to read more about it, there are a bunch of people that went thru similar things and some share their experiences even here on Reddit. 

I'm very happy you found someone to love and that you can trust. Maybe try sharing with him your thoughts and experiences, explains to him why it's difficult for you to be intimate with him and that's not either of your faults. If he is good for you, he will understand and will not push you in to it and will help you find your comfort again. 
If he doesn't do these things, please find a way out. Don't let somebody that doesn't deserve you into your life. 

I know it's difficult to accept that the first time was not as meaningful as you hoped, but it will be ok in the long run. Don't try to force meaning in to it by staying in touch with the ""friend"", the sooner you let him go the sooner you'll find a way to move forward. 
And another advice, find a new thing to give meaning to and look forward in a relationship.

I hope you'll find your peace and comfort :)"

In these kind of days what helps me is my family, they help me and believe in me so it must be true and valid. I (try to) focus on being thankful and that I'm doing the best I can fighting to overcome these symptoms rather than doubt why I'm getting help or the way I'm feeling. 
Another thing that my therapist told me is that ""don't question your instincts and don't look outside to see if they're correct, they're right. If you feel a certain way that feeling is valid""."
toastme,epqwolv,t3_bvgilr,1559413803.0,"I know how you're feeling, I know how sometimes everything can become overwhelming ""just because of a small thing"" but it's not just small if you care about it. Sometimes breaking down and missing out due dates is inevitable. But the fact you keep getting up and keep fighting for your degree is so absolutely incredible. Other people might not be able to see how much effort you put into even doing the basic everyday stuff, but I see it. I appreciate you. You will get past this and past your degree and you'll be an inspiration to other to keep fighting. 
Go do something you like, reward yourself for surviving today even if it doesn't feel like you deserve it. Maybe even something small like buying ice cream or calling somebody you love.

To the first question - I think it's fair towards her to tell her, not leaving it in a weird state of not knowing. Maybe letting her the chance to tell you what she thinks. From my experience - I rather know what are the intentions of a person."

The paramedic told my teacher I can't go up the mountain so on the way up they put me on a cable railway. So good so far. But on the way down the school went down the other side of the mountain - no cable car there. I argued with my teacher that I can't go down because of my knee and she replied with ""suck it up"". I kept arguing with her meanwhile the whole group already started going down and it was only me and her. Then she looked around, told me ""fine, stay here"" turned around and started climbing down leaving me a 12 year old child alone on top of the mountain. I just stayed there shocked an adult would do such thing, they're supposed to take care of me? Finally I crawled my way down, crying. When I got down the whole school was looking for me, apparently my teacher didn't tell the school she left me alone of the mountain and I got punished for wandering off.."
