AskVet,fclhfe6,t3_ehrp7i,1577747865.0,"Your cat sounds  very sick. It sounds like it should be rechecked by the vet. Yes, cats are often terrified of veterinary hospitals, this can result in fear aggression during and after the visit. It's likely not anything your vet did, but just the simple fact that cats are very sensitive to new environments, hate leaving home, and are overstimulated in an environment like that. The majority of cats will act aggressive at the vet at some point, especially when they are not feeling well.

It's also not uncommon for cats to act differently towards their housemates after they get home from the vet. They have been uprooted from their environment (cats are very oriented to their own space) and when they return home it takes a while to readjust.

The inappropriate urination, defecation, and not eating are very concerning. They are indicative of continued illness, cats are very sensitive to periods of not eating so I would suggest rechecking sooner rather than later.

It's impossible to guess at what your cat is sick with given the information you shared. I think you need to discuss what's going on at length with your veterinarian. It seems to me that you don't really understand what's happening medically with your cat. For example, FIV is not a treatable disease in the usual sense. It can cause secondary issues that may be treatable, but it is a chronic untreatable condition.  Female cats are also spayed, not neutered. It's also unclear why your cat is on an antibiotic.

I think you need to go back to your veterinarian. Perhaps prepare a list of questions like you have here so that you can better direct the conversation and make sure you understand everything that they are telling you.  Your vet is going to be MUCH more qualified at answering all these questions because they actually know what's going on with your cat, and we don't.

I really do sympathize with your situation. It can be confusing bringing your cat to the vet, and it's easy for misunderstandings to occur between the pet parent and the veterinarian. I know we throw a lot of information at you all at once and it can be hard to digest. I guess what I'm trying to say is, nothing in your post suggests that your cats current issues are not related to something the veterinarian did, but rather they are likely related to an underlying illness. One that your veterinarian understands much more than internet strangers who have not examined your cat. I think you guys just need to work on communication."

She wanted to staple the new wounds but I requested stitches because my body reacted so poorly to staples last time. She reluctantly agreed, but basically said she wasn't going to ""waste her time"" closing the new wound properly with multiple sutures (which would have been more secure by her own admission) and did a simple continuous suture. She said if  I pick at it it will all come undone so I better not, and then proceeded to suture the wounds after applying lidocaine to only one area.
