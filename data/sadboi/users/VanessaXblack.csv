bipolar,ep5k0s0,t3_btzomj,1559057069.0,I deleted all my main social media‚Äôs because I couldn‚Äôt deal with wanting to post something and then immediately regretting it. I‚Äôm gonna give up drinking for a while too because once I‚Äôve a few in me no one can get me to shut up and it‚Äôs just not worth the anxiety the next day. Hopefully we find something that can stop this and if anyone has any advice I‚Äôd be more than happy to hear.
