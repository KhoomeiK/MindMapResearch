Don’t ignore red flags just because you want to be loved.

I spent almost six years dating a guy who had so many red flags because I wanted so desperately to be seen and loved only to realize it was a waste of time. I’ve felt so alone my whole life that I was willing to be the perfect girlfriend. And I was, I did everything he ever asked of me and now that it’s over and what I thought would be forever is gone I’m stuck. Stuck with the realization that I stuffed my feelings down so I could be seen (but only the way he wanted to see me). I suffered silently with the neglect for years thinking that if I became the best version of myself that he would come around. But the truth is I was already the best version of myself and he didn’t care. 

Don’t be like me, don’t suffer just because you don’t want to be alone. You are already worthy of love, anyone who doesn’t see that isn’t worth your time."

But really sit down and ask yourself if they are actually working on it, cause I always used to say “oh he’s working on himself so it’s fine if he treats me like garbage right now, it’s not forever” but he really never ever was working on himself even a little.

Also think about what you would do if the red flags you see now never go away, could you live in a relationship like that?"

I don’t know honestly, I think it was that I was getting ready to graduate college and he was still at the same place and didn’t support my dreams. He got really really neglectful at the end. I could tell he wanted to leave/didn’t love me but he wouldn’t do it, so I did. He told me when we broke up he didn’t want to lose anymore people so he kept me around as to not hurt me, but I think he was protecting himself. My suffering was immense and obvious, there was no way he couldn’t have known how much he was hurting me.

You only learn by going through terrible shit apparently lmao, so unfair."
relationship_advice,fn9asud,t1_fn97ben,1586765703.0,"No offense. The biggest red flag was that he just wouldn’t communicate with me. Not even about the good stuff in his life. He never asked me how I was doing. I went through our memory box after we broke up and it was full of things I had done for him, he never really gave me gifts. 

I once went on a date and cried the whole time because he wouldn’t say a single word to me but at that point it was too late because I was invested. 
He also never defended me when I stood up to a girl who abused me.

He was bad, but the big thing is he wasn’t interested in me enough to communicate"
relationship_advice,fn9am14,t1_fn9a1qa,1586765490.0,"My ex was like that with the texting thing and I put up with it for years and it was a mistake, people who want to be with you will find the time to be with you. They will put in the effort. 
I’m not saying leave him, you have to make that decision for yourself. But you should only invest in the people the amount they invest in you, pull back and see what happens.

I pulled back and it’s like he didn’t even notice, it’s very isolating and totally unfair in a relationship"
