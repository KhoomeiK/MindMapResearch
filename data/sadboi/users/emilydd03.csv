aspiememes,fqrzbpz,t1_fqrvods,1589595122.0,"See that's an oversimplification of biological sex and the implications of gender roles. 

Any biologist can tell you that we are more than XX and XY. Some folks are XXY or XYY and beyond. 

Did you know autistics begin to mask as early as 6 months old? It's the same with gender. Children start soaking up information from birth and the fact that they observe gender roles from that time period implies that they will be affected by them. It even comes down to the fact that some women tend to get maternity leave after childbirth but men do not tend to get paternity leave so the child sees their mother as their primary caretaker. They absorb what colors they are dressed in and the toys they are given and how they are socialized. Whether they realize it or not, most parents (even progressive ones) tend to model traditional gender roles which rubs off on their children. 

Just a small example:

I had 3 children born with vaginas who were considered ""female-presenting"" until my middle kiddle came out to me as NB. All 3 of those children played and interacted differently, including two who played extremely rough/took more risks/got hurt more often/etc.(Things that are traditionally assigned to children with penises and who are male-presenting) One of them also preferred dinosaurs, Toy Story, TMNT, and their favorite color was blue. The other has been more interested in building and tech than anything else. Their favorite color is green and they plan on being a mail carrier when they grow up. I often shopped and still do shop for them in the ""boys"" section to find clothes they actually like. (Gendered clothes are ridiculous.) 

*Like I mentioned above, I tried to raise them outside of traditional constructs as much as possible which probably led to them feeling more comfortable trying out and expressing diverse interests. They were not limited (as much) by gender roles and social norms as young children. Now that they are in school and exposed to all types of media they will be influenced by those factors as well. 

When it comes to hormones there are some differences when it comes to strength (which can be modified) and physical appearance but you can't forget that hormones are much more varied than most would think. Trans folks often have more varied hormones than cis folks. Lots of folks are born with hormone ""imbalances."" And then there are intersex folks who usually have their own personal combination. 

It is misleading to oversimplify something as complicated as gender and biological sex in humans. We come in lots of diverse orientations and presentations."

We also do not live in a vacuum so since our society is a Christian/white/straight/cis supremacist patriarchy the least empowered minority groups will tend to be entrenched in more subservient roles. (Sexism, racism, classism, etc) 

I definitely agree that we are both a mixture of nature vs. nurture but folks often misunderstand or oversimplify the biologically/genetically diverse evidence that IS nature and how it affects us.

Also most folks just don't want their parents to turn away from or be disappointed in them for any reason. It's tough!

Like my partner used to just tickle my ribs playfully and I'd get so angry. I finally went the fuck off on him and asked him if he'd like it if I stabbed him in the ribs with a knife several times a day because that's what it felt like. He doesn't tickle my ribs anymore. Lol."
AutisticAdults,fq8ap1z,t3_gh9bkw,1589161963.0,"I'm 35 and a late dx and masking has done more harm to me than being autistic has. Who says you can't do and be everything you want just because you're autistic? 

I have a spouse, kids, and the whole 9 yards just like Allistics do. You need to find more of us in the offline world, maybe?  

My spouse is Allistic but ND. Two of my kids are ND and one is Autistic. Our household seems much more fun than most Allistic households, IMO. We do have different challenges than Allistic households but that's not our fault as much as it's a societal problem. 

Autistics actually play with their kids and invest in their interests more. Not that Allistics don't but I do think it comes more naturally to us. All my kids' Allistic friends say I'm the ""cool mom"" and they wish their parents were like me. Why? Because I keep it real with my kids, treat them like actual human beings, play video games and ride bikes, and wear ""cool"" clothes. Lol. (Nintendo/Character tee shirts, brightly colored Chucks, nose ring, wacky hair) 

I understand not fitting in fucking sucks sometimes, a lot of times. Especially when you're young. But don't sell yourself short either. You can have a meaningful and fulfilling life just like everybody else. I promise! 

This is probably not the answer you wanted but I can't bear teaching someone how to mask even more than they already do when it'll eventually kill them from the inside out.

I do recommend finding a good therapist, as mentioned above, and perhaps finding a group of folks with similar interests and/or an Autistic/ND meet-up group near you. Start looking around you very carefully and I guarantee you'll find more of us out there than you would think. 💜"
aspiememes,fq86v7e,t1_fq67wre,1589159701.0,"I grew up near a military base (in the US Midwest) and there were a lot of German military spouses. A lot of folks thought they were kinda rude until they got to know them but I never thought so. 

I think it boils down to cultural conversational style differences. Germans seems to be more direct and would dance around their point a lot less. I've always gotten along quite well with the Germans I've met.

I always figured it was because my Great Grandma was full German so I was more used to them right off the bat. But as I've gotten older and thought about it more, I think it has less to do with that and more to do with my autistic conversational style being more comfortable with German conversational style. I always knew where I stood with my German friends and coworkers."

So I haven't listened to any foreign music for a while but I do recommend Lakota/Sioux music. It's very... idk something you feel inside of you when you hear it. I'm not religious at all but it almost feels spiritual? I'm not sure I can explain it properly. It's fairly easy to find on the internet though."

What I really meant was not something to communicate with in a traditional sense as much as something that brings us all together.

AskParents,fpmno0w,t3_ge8o4b,1588737139.0,"From what I've read from doctors is that a lot of kids ""play doctor"" with each other out of curiosity when they're pretty young. What you have to watch out for is if there is a significant age gap and if it seems predatory in any way.

My biggest concern would probably be where the 6m saw/heard about ""butt-kissing and scratching"" and whether he's getting the right kind of conversation with his parents about it. Why I say that is because he seemed pretty zoned in on a specific body part (her butt) and that some kids that have already been preyed on act out those experiences on other children. (Hypersexual behaviors)

As long as you're confident that he hasn't been abused or purposely exposed to adult content then it was probably just curiosity.

*I know it can be veeeery embarrassing for some ppl to talk about bodies and sex with their kids but keeping an ongoing discussion and adding age appropriate info as they grow is the best way to prepare and protect them from abusive/predatory behavior in the future.

Teach them that adults aren't always right and model that behavior.
(Including apologizing to them when you make a mistake.) This is more important than most adults realize, I think!

Teach them the proper names for their body parts, like vulva and penis. They might not say them correctly at first but keep repeating it in your discussions w/ them and they will eventually pick it up. It will be a lot easier for you to understand and for a child to report abuse if they can say the proper names.

Teach them that SOME adults and/or older kids have a sickness inside of them that makes them hurt kids and do things they aren't supposed to. 

*You don't have to go into a lot of details or scare them but that part is very important. Statistically they are much more likely to be sexually abused by a family member, babysitter, family friend, etc than some rando off the street.

This sounds fairly innocent, probably curiosity more than anything, but I would keep an eye on them when playing together and not let them play together out of sight. The fact that he is 3 yrs older and knew that he was doing something he wasn't supposed to but did it anyway to someone he knew he had a power advantage over is a good indicator that he needs more discussion about these subjects and that he should be watched closely with younger children until you're confident the message has sunk in.
