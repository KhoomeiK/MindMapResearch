BPD,fr2szvu,t1_fr1yapu,1589843309.0,"No. Nor did I that this was anything to do with sexual assault or major miscommunication, kinda reminded me of the phrase friends with benefits. Which in its self is another grey area.

I guess I was trying to contextuallise myself, a stranger to you. Through explaining something where the core reason it happen was the self sacrificial system. 

When I spoke of miscommunication in terms of this I was more talking about miscommunication within yourself, being unable to listen to the tiniest of voices (aka intuition on either it's the best thing to do for all involved)

Good to hear you had a chat with her, did you discuss going forward (aka what are her needs and boundaries) because if you know for sure then you and parts of your brain wanting love the most will know. So they are far less likely to assume and sacrifice. 

In terms of stuff that has helped, it's about a spiritual journey. I have a list of resources [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/lodge-san/comments/gmcmwi/resources_for_mental_health/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"
Empaths,fr1tjek,t3_gm0yzc,1589825697.0,"Faith in your higher self
Tarot helps with this

Do not worry about other feelings, you cannot live others life for them/walk their path for them. But I understand being empathic it is hard to do so, when you feel theres as clearly as your own.

Jelly for me is because I feel like I do not have as much love, it always comes back to love, as the person I am jealous of. 

I think you are doing a fantastic job on journey, I can see your wisdom.

Know that life has its cycles and dark times come but they are just as important as the light times. As it is in the dark where the seed finds its nutrients to grow towards the sun. 

If you feel safe ways to dive deep to heal are:
Breath work, journaling, spiritual research (shadow walkers/workers)

Balance is important! Remember to incorporate some positive practices into your life such as:
Gratitudes, dancing, Shakti mat (if you have one), nature, song meditation, listen to high frequencies. Also do anything that brings you joy and it's okay you lean back on some comfort safety mechanism every now and then."
BPD,fr1rldc,t3_gm16jw,1589824751.0,"Hey
I can't diagnos you but I have a few questions.

Do you feel a lot all the time?

Are you acutely aware of others emotional state?
Even if they don't say or try to hide it

Do you get overwhelmed in group setting because you notice the micro expression and know how each individual is feeling roughly?

If yes to most of the above, Would you say that you judge/blame/shame yourself if you sense/presume that someone has negative feelings or beliefs about you?

BPD is a system of protection and survival mechanism that develops in early childhood. When we did not get enough support from our primary caregivers, we had to develop hightened awareness of others to let us know when we were safe or not. 
This is the most common but unknown trait within most (if not all) people that have developed the BPD system.

Also known as Empathy or Emapthic abilities.

There are also different traits that can be developed ranging from lashing out, shutting down, self deprication. All of these are methods as child in an unhealthy home to try to get a parents attention and care. 

That is to say they aren't inately negative just dire methods used in a dire situation. Survival.

Anywho hope this helped a little. BPD isn't something that one has to have for the rest of their life, but it does take time to heal those wounds, and knowing that it's there helps with being aware of the internal/external reactions to events."
BPD,fr1oei3,t1_fr1lm4p,1589823217.0,"Hey I would like to hold some space for unpacking and healing. Especially because I have a lot of tools in my tool belt.

But I cannot personally do the deep dive with you at this exact time, I usually would love to help anyone but the time isn't quite right for me to hold that space for others just yet.

Here is what I can do for you; I can give you tools and resources, to pick and choose. Figure out what works for you and your journey. 

They all come with a stamp of approval, tried and tested personally.

These tools aren't to fix your immediate concerns. But instead are to hit and heal the core trauma that is allowing all reoccurring friction in your day to day. 

So if you are ready for real massive change, can be open minded, and are willing to roll up your sleeves to put in the hard yards; I am all here for that."
BPD,fr1m79g,t1_fr1kzot,1589822144.0,"I should've also mentioned I do not believe in the ""life time BPD diagnosis"" same goes for most mental health diagnosis. I see it more as a system that was created for protection and survival that no longer serves the individual.

 So when I say growth I mean healing from the core trauma and going on to live a life without that system reeking havoc on the body mind.

That is to say after/during healing any relationship can last."
BPD,fr1ledo,t1_fr1jjti,1589821751.0,PS hit me up in my DMS if you ever need to chat. Tho I only come on here once a week ish.
BPD,fr1l9se,t1_fr1jjti,1589821687.0,"No worries, I can't sleep and I have no better things to do. Helping others is almost like helping myself. Cuz I know past me would've appreciated someone who undstood what they were experiencing."
BPD,fr1kfss,t3_gm4r7e,1589821267.0,"Hmmmm

Firstly I want to say that you are doing amazing to recognise that need to feel and want for connection.  Also to be aware of that fear of opening shows me that you are on the precipice of a new step on your journey. 

Fear isn't your enemy, fear in some cases such as this is trying to keep you safe, a internal protector of sort. 

Fear along with all facets of your internal world are using their own methods to keep you safe.

Often this leads to multiple parties clashing heads because they each individually think that their method is best. But when you open a dialogue with what ever is on top allowing all involved to speak, things can be slowly resolved.

The method I use is treating what ever comes up with kindness and asking them why are they acting a certain way. Sometimes I have to set boundaries with my own brain so it doesn't yell/shame at other committee members (my name for the complexity of different parts of my brain).

This sounds crazy I know, but my therapist got me on to this way of treating my brain and it has really helped.

Something that helps with the dialogue of two parts of myself is writing. In my dominant hand I write the dialogue of the dominant/louder voice and in the other I write the quieter voice. I take my time and there is no wrong answers.

I got more info on stuff that helps me open up if your are interested."
BPD,fr1hlgj,t1_fr1grzt,1589819864.0,"Thank you, sorry if I was a bit preachy. Your are doing the best you can and that's all we can ever do. So (I know this may sound strange) I am proud of you even for just being here now. Cuz I know how painful it can all be and I also know how much effort it too to carry on. So thank you for being"
BPD,fr1gy7z,t3_gm17pt,1589819542.0,"My honest opinion from someone who has experienced similar (me-bpd partner-depression&co)

No

But...

Each relationship is important to honour when it is happening. This means focus as much as possible on your own growth (always, but especially in relationships). 

Why?

When you do this it subconsciously shows the partner that they too can be growing. Even if the partner in question doesn't have mental health issues, still focus on your growth! Because one of the main reasons relationships end is stagnation.

If you focus on your growth the relationship has the opportunity to flourish and continue for a long time. 

Here is the caviot and a BIG ONE at that; life is about learning lessons, those lessons will repeat themselves untill you have learnt them. 

What does this mean? It means we will know failure. 

Failure isn't supposed to be scary it is an important part of learning and growth. 

Trust me when I say, when you dedicate yourself to growth life gets sweater and more beautiful than you could've ever dreamt of."
BPD,fr1em6j,t3_gm285w,1589818370.0,"This may be out there, and it's not for everyone. 
I have never understood the one partner thing for a few reasons:
1) It is suffocating for me and for them to constantly rely on each other
2) No one person can provide space/bring out all sides of me, just like no one friend is like another.


Thinking about others is not cheating. If it was... porn would be cheating, or reading smutty fanfic, or fantasies about your fav actor, ect ect.

I understand the shame and guilt, but that comes from the stories society tells us. How to act and how to be. This is just amplified when one lives with a BPD system because we want to have a secure place from where we receive love.

I am going to tell you a hard truth, you will not find constant unconditional love from anyone outside yourself. You will not find that love you seek most from others.

Here is another hard truth; that love, that unconditional love that will always be there for you, can only be found from within.

It takes a journey to understand this fully, to embody it. But it is worth it. I used to experience what you have spoken of but that was a different person to who I am now, I no longer feel like a monster. I have more care and love for myself and I hope that you will continue on your path to get here one day too. 

It's a beautiful ride that is for sure!

[Edit: PS if he cheated is he worthy of your time and energy? Imagine giving yourself the amount of love you give him.]"
BPD,fr1bhlg,t3_gm3cs1,1589816794.0,"Thank you for your courage in sharing. I have over my life developed sexual repulsion and am on the asexually spectrum because of it.

My experience is completely different but I noticed that all the instances where I was sexually assaulted or more, they where all in the grey area. It wasn't all their fault nor was it all mine. 

In all cases my boundaries were crossed. Some I didn't even notice until after. Some I told them my boundaries and some I couldn't communicate at all. Some I loved them (not sexually) and automatically sacrificed my self to show that love (even though I did not want to do it) 

I think it is quite common to give yourself over sexually to someone you plutonicaly care about, even without BPD. But when one experiences BPD it is easier to fall into. My thoughts on this is that BPD system restricts the awareness of that little voice of boundaries and heightens the voice of craving others love. With all that in the moment it is hard to know what you need, let alone act on it.

In terms of healing from your experience it will be linked into healing journey in general and will come when that part is ready to be healed. As it is so closely linked to other parts that also need healing and attention.

I can recommend some things that have helped me generally speaking on that journey.

Also note: I have a different view on BPD and mental health issues that aren't exactly liked by the masses because I see most mental health ""diagnosises"" as symptoms of a larger issue."
Empaths,fpc6bou,t3_gcm1sy,1588489068.0,"I have been luck to be surrounded by people who are well aware of their own empathic abilities. 

Ignorance of things that are beyond the perceivable is common in some countries. But with the shift in consciousness hopefully you will find more and more people who understand your experience or at the very least are accepting.

Usually it is language that fails us when we want to communicate our experience to another, and using one that has all these specific terms may hinder the connection. Because many people dismiss the woo woo of the world.

So what I do to explain my empathy to someone who is uneducated in that matter I say things likev I am a sponge when I am with other people, I am very perceptive to others emotional state because that is how I was taught to be growing up. 

I also use empathic abilities with knowledge of my interpersonal to discern wither or not I want to be around certain people and either or not I can trust them to tell them about this.

I used to be all open to people but I found out about Brené Brown and she says that being vulnerable is different to being an open book."
BPD,fp673r1,t1_fp5pz34,1588347267.0,No worries good luck stay safe.

Yeah I have watch the midnight gospel IN ONE GO currently rewatching. It is dope!

My journey also started out with taking LSD for the first time. The perspective I have on drugs is only to use ones from mother earth, this is including non-psychedelic plant usage for eating and topical usage.

BPD,fp51nc3,t3_gbceq1,1588313460.0,"The first and foremost greatest shift in my life has been finding spirituality. 

Just to clarify NOT religion!  Although religious texts are interesting and have a core essence of what is. Religion is too muddied to truely get to the point of it all.

I'm not going to talk much more about what I believe because that is for the individual journey to discover. But I will say this:

Through my spiritual journey I have discovered and experienced pure unconditional love for myself. 

When I am single I am very healthy. 
I have never gone through DBT and I don't take medication as it's not worked for me.

When I go into relationships I fall back on relying on their source of love, which is very strong and intoxicating in the first part of that relationship.

And this is where things start to go lopsided no body can support and pour that much love into someone else for a long extended time. 

We have to continue to love our selves (from our own infinite source of love) which is always with us. Otherwise the relationship becomes a battle for energy of each other. 

The only sustainable way is to rely on that which is within all of us. 

There is a lot more I know but I recommend keeping your eyes peeled for ""the Celestine prophecy, an adventure"" this book describes this much better than I could ever do so.

In the meantime allow you to have space from your partner and try to find the one that love you unconditionally inside yourself.
Taking your first steps into your spiritual journey will also help you find this love."
BPD,fp50bul,t1_fp4p5qs,1588312326.0,"The book is called ""The Celestine Prophecy an adventure""  it's a new age novel so it's super easy to digest because the beneficial information is told in story format.

Don't take my methods as something set in stone, finding your own path is a fantastic thing. 

So most say meditation is key for healing and dealing well with what ever comes. I find it extremely hard so I've developed some tools that bring me the same/similar things.

Releasing pent up low (fear and anger based) energy is a healthy for the body and mind. Dancing in my room to some jams is a healthy release. 

So is mind dumping things on paper, not always words. Doodles  are handy to access sadness which for me is often covered up by other emotions to protect the one that feels sad inside.

Going for walks listening to satsangs, which are like talks with a spiritual guide are peaceful and get me thinking. Could also be podcast with people who have interesting ideas (I like Brené Brown, Duncan Trussle, Russel Brand)

Get into nature as much as possible because trees and don't only take on CO2 but can bare the brunt of low vibes and replenish you stock of energy.

Last but not least, one of the most important things is take it slowly growth is supposed to take time. It's okay to rely on old habits of protection and comfort. 

You got this!"
BPD,fp4oz3a,t3_gb9szh,1588303898.0,"Hate doesn't really exist for me, as the word isn't really a thing that is possible in my experience.

What I mean is I can feel angry, incredible amounts of rage and also low subletter anger towards people I love.

I had a look at that part of me and I found the anger was protecting something deeper within. I gave it some space to come out and it was fear of loosing my loved ones. The anger was only there protecting that one because that one has been hurt by loved ones before."
BPD,fp4ogo1,t3_gb9ub9,1588303562.0,"Fair enough. It sounds anxiety inducing and also sounds like she has a little narcissism if she cannot listen to others and is word vomiting all over every friend with the same me me me story. 

There was once a book I read and it talked bout 4 different types of how people take energy from those around them. 

Aggressive and pity me.
Questioner and aloof.
(These two groupings work against each other)

Pity me takes from pity by telling (and believing that they are a victim) and perpetuating that story. When you talk to them you feel drained afterwards. 

Idk if you want advice  so I'll leave it at that, but I have a few techniques to help out.

One thing I do want to say feeling or being pissed off at them will only feed them your energy more."
BPD,fp4n787,t3_gb9z4g,1588302744.0,"When someone wants me to change I don't exactly appreciate it. Because usually this want is one for instant growth. We are constantly changing and growing the entire world is. But do you see anyone threating their roses to grow faster?

The ludicrous idea and want for someone to change is because they themselves can not hold space for you or support you in the way they want. 

In most cases they will be unaware of their own needs and that the responsibility is theirs to communicate their boundaries with you. It's also their responsibility to fulfill those needs them selves.

Yes you have BPD, so what? It just means your human and that your journey is different to his. If he cannot handle it then he should take responsibility for that instead of blaming you on his own short comings. 

Most people cannot parent themselves because they've never really learned nor will they learn, and if they cannot parent themselves the definitely cannot do this for others sustainably. 

People with BPD are here to learn how to sustain love for themselves so that we do not attach our self worth to others love. 

My opinion we are lucky to be given the opportunity to learn this in a world that advertises love from others as being the goal to life. It is not. 

You do not need to grow faster than you already are, if he needs a break from you let him have that break. Focus on yourself, learn to love you. A husband/wife/partner/fp is not the be all and end all to a life well lived."

Diagnostic are limited and short sighted. Everyone experiences things differently. 

This is something my therapist says, people diagnosed with BPD are very sensitive people who often have large capacities for empathy (to the point of becoming a sponge sometimes). 

Sometimes a diagnosis is only good to bring awareness to how your brain and body has produced systems of protection.

It is a journey of becoming aware, acceptance of self, self love, grief and all the other things associated to your life.

Everyone is on this journey, just most people don't do it till much later because they can ignore it untill it becomes unbearable for them.

(Example: ""I am truely thankful for ... Because ..."" ""I am grateful for ... Because ..."")

 ===>¡¡¡IT CAN BE ANYTHING!!!<===

(Example: having legs, the sun, running water or YouTube)

At the end read aloud or in your mind these things and try to really feel the gratitude.

• Again gratitude, but this time before you sleep. First go find a nice rock. Then at the end of the day right before you fall asleep, hold this rock in your hand and think back on that day. Think about what you really enjoyed, what was your tallest peak of the day.

• Do one thing a day it doesn't have to be big but aim to do at least one thing. It could be doing the laundry or drawing something. Anything!

• Limit your time reading or watching things about covid-19 to 30min or less a day!

• Find a spiritual practice or practice [meditation](https://youtu.be/VD7Brg0geVA)"

If I get angry or annoyed at something, what is that saying. Or if I'm sad and disappointed what is that saying.

For example someone (or even in my own brain) says something to me I get sad and a little annoyed because the lack of respect, understanding and love in that comment. Ah! I need respect, understanding and love.

How do I then go bout that? I ask and if they can't provide, why can't they do that? Is there a legitemit reason, like they were only trying to give advise but i heard it wrong. 

If that's the thing then I set boundaries with myself like when this happens I tell them ""I have to take a minute because I am feeling ... And this has nothing to do with them I just need some extra time to process""

First comes the needs, second the curiosity and lastly the boundaries. Writing helps sort them out, and it's okay to take some time, it doesn't happen all at once. I'm still practicing and I fuck up every now and then."

If you don't get ""social cues"" or know boundaries just ask. It's scary at first. Also get to know your own needs and boundaries knowing these will help with the conversation about boundaries of others cause you have your own needs. Your own needs are worth too!!! Sacrificing yourself doesn't help relationships, it can come across as overbearing or too much.

If you find people who respect you and you can respect them and have open communication then those relationships you want will come. It's hard and you'll make mistakes but that's okay.

BPD,fjeshr7,t1_fjekvlr,1583277412.0,"Well it feels like that so I've set some boundaries with them.

I'm not gonna let my diagnosis run my life. I choose to heal rather than let it consume me.

Life is full of pain and joy but one cannot experience one without the other.

I'm not choosing to sacrifice myself for them, Ive done that enough in my life. Nor am I pandering to the BPD ego, yeah I still want them in my life and that is okay. What isn't okay is the earge to have them be there for me all the time no matter what, the craving the addiction. 

Life gives us challenges for growth, and will continue to give us the same ones over and over untill we learn. I'd rather learn now than later.

PS sorry if I am replying in a weird fashion I'm still getting used to reddit app.

PPS I appreciate your opinion especially because I am sure you went through something to form this one, and your experience is valid! So thank you, for offering yours 😊"
BPD,fjerj4u,t1_fjekqnk,1583276905.0,"Yes actually. Nothing negative happened to make us break up. It was that neither of us we growing in that kind of relationship.

We also were more friends than lovers, that's what made the relationship healthier than my last. Because I was able to communicate stuff. 

Being friends allows me to grow individually and still have someone I trust to be vuneriable with without depending on them.

I have this issue where I can't or don't want to access my emotions, therefore I don't process them. But when someone holds space for that, my emotions can come freely. I'm done with bottling up my emotions, it just leads do really dark shit."
BPD,fjck8xr,t3_fcq3r8,1583223636.0,"Honestly on those vibes right now, my partner and I broke up the day after my birthday (a weekish ago)

It was mutual as we set the standard of our relationship on growth of the individual is more important than being together in a romantic relationship.As usual my BPD turned it into a codependent relationship, which destroyed it.

And now I want to be able to be held and cry my eyes out with a friend, but the only person I trust to be vuneriable around is my ex. 

I don't have much advise on the trusting others thing because I'm at the moment in the same boat. But I think if you are able to converse with a choose few about your needs and boundaries that is a great step in the right direction.

Finding understanding and empathetic people is hard! Some of the communities Ive found some people are (but are not limited to): lgbtqia, witch communities, activists, artists (of any kind) and burners. 

Just note that everyone is dealing with there own shit because of that they are more open to internal growth and all that incompases. Though this also may mean that their way of being may be polar opposite of what you need.

There a loads of people out there who could be a part of your choose family. But while you wait to cross paths with them, you're welcome to find community here. 

PS Feel free to hit me up for chats cuz it's what I need right now too ✨"
BPD,fjcjhu0,t1_fjcgwla,1583222693.0,"Hell even though it's been a week, I know that it would be easier to cut ties.

But there is a saying that goes ""often what's the hardest thing to do is the right thing to do""

Life offers us opportunities to grow, maybe this is one of those.

I will have to be super vigilant about my habits (all of them and the complicated fuckery that they are) and most importantly I have to continue to set boundaries to continue to grow independently.

I'll see what happens as I still don't know, and I'll trust that what is needs to be happening for my growth.

Thank you for your words, you held space for me to really think on what felt right without letting my brain say all sorts of contradictory crap."

I definitely want to be more aware of my patterns and not fall into that again in any relationship. 

I don't what's gonna happen, I'm both shit scared and okay at the same time with letting what happen happen.

I found if I haven't learnt a lesson then something happens again and again till I learn it.

Here is to learning it🍻!!

I wish there was just better info instead of crusty old doctors reading anichent tombs and telling us what is and what isn't like it's set in stone for everyone.

(That's me pissed off at the system tho, happens all the time. Haha maybe I split on the system rather than the people)

Something that helped me with that was a detachment from my thoughts. I'll use a metaphor here, it's like a lots of people coming to hug me but I don't hug back nor do I push them off me, I just simply do not interact. I am just there to be.

If you feel up to research, some talks that helped me were ""mooji"" on YouTube"

The only advice I can give is looking into MDMA treatment with a professional, or similarly Ayahuasca treatment again with a shaman preferably a course of treatment with a therapist on site to help guide you after dosage.

There is a lot of information online but if you are in America I would advise using duck go go or another incripted platform to resuearch."

BPD,fj6c6w6,t3_fbaogk,1583066808.0,"Okay this is a little rant ... Just a warning.

One society is fucked and that's why a majority think that time, vulnerability and love are only given to their significant other. This is some big brainwashing that everyone experiences especially in western culture.

Because of this we don't have the support we all need it is dangerous to ask others for support on a meaningful way. Because everyone is also experiencing some sort of pain as well. 

Rant over, that was the bad news.

THE GOOD NEWS IS:

That there are people who are aware of the shit and are healing themselves. They are actively participating on their own journey. 

These people are the people you want to find (or who will find you) and surround yourself with. These are the people who will become your village, your community. The people you can be open with and grow with.

But you have to be really wanting that growth, that's the first step. (It's okay if you loose that step every now and then juts remember to come back to it.)

One last sad truth about life, in general people come and go. We have a lesson to learn that this is okay, this is necessary for their growth and eventually mine.

Much love to you (whomever's reading this) from this strange stranger."
BPD,fj6b9yr,t3_fbkvpb,1583065717.0,"Changing that habit of isolation and replace it with another.

There is quite a lot of info on habit forming online, but the basics are replace old habit by forming a better one. Doing the new one everyday for 30 days no matter what.

For myself isolation=get out of the house everyday

That doesn't mean go meet people or do something, on my hardest days it means go for a walk outside even if it's like only down the street and back again. I try and go when the sun's out as that helps with dopeemine (the good brain juice). Which helps ingrain that new habit even more.

I terms of talking with people I use social media and try to see atleast one person per week (not including flatmates). And so I can't cancel on them I make sure they come to mine.

I hope this helps thank you for reading. This also helps with the loneliness for me."

🌑🌒🌓🌔🌕

And again and again.

We have dark times but we always come out. 
We go back again to into dark times and we think ""SHIT we are here again FUCK!""
""What if I don't get out again?! I am scared of that""

When dark times come we have to find little stars of joy and love, it is okay if they are not big or bright.

Life always provides the teachers around the dark times. Sometimes they are books, videos, people in real life or even people here.

I've experienced that many times and giving sexual favours to male body people so that I feel acceptance and some form of love has gotten me in to a lot of trouble.

Especially when I was younger and couldn't tell them to stop because I thought it hurt their feelings.

Sorry it was too much info. But your not alone."
BPD,fj6a5l0,t3_fbmklu,1583064289.0,"There is a lot on my journey that has helped me along my path, and most of the massive things that shifted my health were books that just popped into my life.

The Celestine prophecy
The power of now

Were the first two, I found my spiritual side and that helped a lot with self love. 

For me the ... ""Creator"" ""Krishna"" ""god"" ""universe"" (what ever name you choose) is the truth of who we all are and what everything is at its base nature. This is the only constant the rest is changing, the body you have is not the body you were born with, that thought or emotion isn't you it comes and goes. 

I won't go on, but this helped me. But know that it's a constant journey and even with this knowledge I forget. Especially in (and on either side of) relationships I find I loose the love that's within me. Because I fell back on a habit of craving ""easy"" love. I call it easy because I don't have to maintain a connection (focus) with my ""higher"" self. 

If you are interested in going down this path just be wary of religion as at the core it has the truth, that's why people are drawn to religion (and some people succeed in finding the truths of those texts) but it is very convoluted with ego's over. 

All I'm gonna say is your truth is within you!!!
