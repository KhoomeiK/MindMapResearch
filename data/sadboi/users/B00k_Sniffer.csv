I just feel so alone and overwhelmed. But on to my wins. Exercise makes my anxiety go crazy, I panic and stop. Well, I'm only a few videos away from completing a 30 day yoga playlist! I've skipped days in between, but I'm doing it. Sometimes I'm scared, but I power through. My second win is that I have agoraphobia and I went outside the other day.

I knew he was coming over to collect rent that day so right after work I stopped at the bank and got out the money. I let him in and gave him the money, it was my first time ever paying rent as my fiance always did it. I handed him the money and he said that I was short 30 dollars, and asked if I could go get the rest, he'd be in the building for a bit doing work. So I turned off the pan of food and carried my daughter to the bank to get the money out (no drivers license at that point), came home, gave him the money, shut my door, and cried more than I think I ever had in my life."
Showerthoughts,fm9edcg,t3_ftrytk,1585867015.0,"I like my bed against the wall because if I'm all safe and cozy sleeping with the wall at my back than the bad guys can't get me. My boyfriend sleeps in front of me and I also have some stuffed animals who have my back. Just gotta make sure I keep the blanket over my shoulders and my feet in, because monsters."

Anxiety,fm5tw67,t3_fsyn03,1585779868.0,"My anxiety and OCD are exploding lately and of course depression has shoved its way in on the fun too. My win is that I've been having suicidal thoughts a lot, especially today, and I'm still here. I tried reaching out for help with no luck, it got ignored, but I still reached out, and that's a win."
Sims4,fm2w1qa,t1_fm2sc54,1585706740.0,Ok! I just saw this. How neat this game is! I'm moving my alien Sim in to a house with her new husband who is a human and wanted to know what to expect when they start having kids. I hope their children are as gorgeous as yours!!!

OCD,fm134ln,t3_fs5hbo,1585671119.0,"I'm in this picture and I don't like it! Haha! Seriously though, I love this place, I went from feeling so weird and alone to feeling a bit normal if that makes sense, like yayy! Other people do that too! I'm not as alone as I think :)"
