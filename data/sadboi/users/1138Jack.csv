whoop,f9jlbvb,t1_f9jjzcw,1575378731.0,Oh okay. Was wondering if fast metabolism could be causing high strain based off of the comment above. How is the IF working out? What is your goal?
whoop,f9jgx9c,t1_f9iylkj,1575373826.0,"Yea, it was a little off but not enough to stop me from continuing to wear mine. It took some time to adjust because it was originally my fiancé’s. Do you track your caloric intake?"
whoop,f9i85lm,t1_f9i7nkd,1575330603.0,Let me know when you do. I used two whoops at once on the same wrist to test accuracy but didn’t think about trying it on diff hands.

Lyme,f1xyati,t1_f1r5l60,1569805962.0,I agree. This test is confusing. It looks like a combo of two different tests.
Lyme,f1xy6s7,t1_f1rax28,1569805903.0,There have been bands before. I’ll have to look for the results but there were I think two and 41 was one of them.

Lyme,f1qbh4n,t1_f1qawc9,1569697403.0,Will do. I did have symptoms at the time of the test. That was the second test. The first test was EBV and Lyme with positive results for both.
Lyme,f1qa96h,t3_dak0tp,1569696641.0,Ss. Nurse said over the phone this indicates a previous infection. I have an appointment with my doc in a week but wanted to see what you guys thought.

HVAC,ex0q5x2,t1_ewwoi6u,1565919470.0,"Thanks. Ill have a pro come check it out, see what he says, then decide if it's something I can attempt myself. I my even ask him directly. 

Tapping may be the hardest part. Two ducts already run to the other side of the garage so I would follow the same path.

Addition: tell me more about this bypass grille and dehumidifier"
HVAC,ewrehpx,t1_ewr3kmq,1565703393.0,"Not planning on running anything inside the garage. It is a home gym and storage area. A car wouldn’t fit in it anyway. I’m planning on building a proper garage in a few years detached from the house. 

The ac duct is my first step. Then I will install a French drain along the outside to carry water away"
HVAC,ewr8s3t,t1_ewr4eld,1565698625.0,Code does make sense. I’ll have to figure out another way to mitigate the mold and cool down the garage.

I'm having issues with mold in my garage due to poor airflow/moisture and thought adding some ac to it would cool the rest of the house, stop the mold growth, and give me a nice temp to workout in.
