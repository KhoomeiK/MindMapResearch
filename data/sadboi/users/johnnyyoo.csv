fantasyfootballadvice,f9ccius,t1_f9boxyp,1575221942.0,Only thing that worries me about Hunt is that Pittsburgh D. They are pretty stout.
fantasyfootballadvice,f9bm3w5,t3_e490t1,1575214051.0,I'm in the exact situation as you. I am in the 6 spot and this will make or break my chances as well and I was leaning Slayton
depression,ezy6lj7,t3_d2pnl8,1568259310.0,"I understand how you feel. I think the more isolated you are with the rest  of the world, the harder it is to feel any emotions.

depression,eowcxhm,t1_eotyec3,1558908156.0,"I would think video games would make things even worse. Plus, I am a horrible gamer."
depression,eowcpwh,t1_eou4318,1558908072.0,I'm in logistics.
