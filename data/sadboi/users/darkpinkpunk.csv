Without makeup and trendy clothes we can see how individual each person is, and even if we all dont look the same due same makeup routine etc, I'm more attracted to people which just try to be themselves without masks. Everyone is kinda beautiful, we don't have to adjust to one stereotype. ^-^"

Because I felt kinda pressured from the society, everyone had to look good and wear nice outfits etc. But since I met better people who doesn't really care about how you look or doesn't comment you how sick you look without make up, I feel also good without it. Sometimes I just leave the house like a homeless, but I dont care anymore. And it feels so good to feel loved even without looking on fleek. My skin is really good now. Just do your eyebrows and shave some lil hair off the face and go outside and the sun will do the rest - natural looks are so beautiful."

There you can see how the most companies work. The thing is, we literally don't need to eat animal products because the important vitamins like b12 is also available for humans to take via medicine, tablets, injections. If you're eating meat theres only b12 because the animals got fed with b12 tablets and also antibiotics to prevent sickness because they can't live properly in their 1x1m places, where they have to stay like all their lifes. Cows are getting artificial fertilization because that's the only way the cows produce milk, because it's for the baby's. Its simply mothermilk for her child. So the cow starts getting milk and then after birth immediately they steal her the baby to get all her milk. If it's a male cow it gets killed and if its female it have to go through the same torture like her mother. Which she never met. When a cow stops giving enough milk they are getting slaughtered. We dont need to eat meat, we dont have to let the animals suffer so much. And this is only a super small aspect of the cruelty.

But on the other hand I'm so tired of everything and all the evil ness that kinda rules the whole world. But then I'm having fun and a good time and I am happy, but only for a limited time. Then everything's bad again.

I would maybe try at your position some meditation, I know it's hard at the beginning but just to get your mind more ordered. Honey is an awesome person and I am sure she want you to live for her. She truly loves you and you had a beautiful time with her. But don't forget there are others that really love you and care about you. Your family and hers, all if your friends. They want you to be happy and you deserve it also. She also wants that you're happy and enjoy life. Go back to Ireland if it helps you and maybe find some new people and talk to them, not only about this situation, just embrace something new in your life. It's so important that you can enjoy your existence again. The pain never will fade but you'll find out how to live with it.

I wish you only the best and take her positivity and if she had a dream to do something, think about making her dream come true and make her happy, be good to people like she was and smile like she smiled at you. Maybe you can see her one time again and she would be so happy go hear what you reached in life. If you want to talk to strangers because it's easier, do it.

There were some people also there but no one said something. Me, 16 at the time just screamed all over the place that this dumbass should stop showing his weakness. He shouted at me and threatened me, but stopped hurting his wife. They get in the car and left the lot.
 After that a man drive near to me with his car and said I also should have called the police. Can you imagine, a kid, teenager had to stop this situation and I also should call the police, while this man and others just watched.
Many saw this whole situation and no one did anything. I'm still angry about it but I will never stop to help and think like the others "" someone else will care "". Good that people have the courage and help people in danger."

And about your face, girl don't be ashamed only because you're individual. You think you look bad but I'm sure if you are motivated and try hard to workout and lose weight you will see yourself from a new perspective. 
Many many people struggle with acne but the better you eat, stop eating unhealthy and fats and it will get better, honestly. 

Fuck those people, everyone has to deal with some demons in human form and don't let them drag you down, you dont deserve it to be sad. I'm sorry that you're parents arent the supportive ones. But when you're old enough you can move out und till now just tell you're parents to please help you to buy healthy food and cook properly, if you have a bike then ride it and enjoy the nature outside. If not, just go for walks but every day. It will clear your mind and it's better then just sitting at home. If you can afford it ask if you can join a gym to stay motivated. Every kind of people are going there and you could workout properly. 

I wish you only the best and you will get through it, it will come better times and you will meet friends and people who love you for who you are. <3"
