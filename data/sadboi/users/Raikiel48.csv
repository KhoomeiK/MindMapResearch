In fact, most of what transgender people believe is that if they like doing this thing that is stereotyped as belonging to the other sex, then that means they must be that other sex. I think the general consensus here is that stereotypes are limiting and that they need to be eliminated whatever the cost. 

I identified as a transman for three years out of my life. And the only thing going through my mind was that I was thinking I wasn't ""like most other women."" Therefore, it's only logical I was meant to be a guy, and that my ""typically masculine"" interests were only solidifying that. 

Otherwise, I really don't know what I think about it. In fact, it only makes me sad that the age of feminine guys and masculine chicks is being put to an end because of the medicalization and ""political correctness"" of things. I really wish instant-gratification didn't ruin things so much."

Your best bet is to buy the mini edition of the NES console for 35$. It has 650 games built into it, including the original Legend of Zelda. It's alot more bang for your buck, even it you have to put up with it's smaller, less impressive design. Ha ha. Plus, it feels a little more authentic with the same controller used with the system.

I'm not a fan of gender roles. But I'm also not sure what to do about them because they continue to be passed down through example by conservative/traditional families. I don't think we should do away with them entirely, but if someone wants to deviate from the norm, they absolutely should be allowed to. 

Men and women will always be complementary to each other, but that's not a bad thing. And it definitely shouldn't be in a bad way. I like to think that just because of physical features, humans live in a sort of yin-yang existence. And I'm NOT using this as a way to discredit homosexual relationships. Anyone can be a compliment to another person. 

Children are blank canvases and they MUST be given the freedom to paint them as they please. Let them be themselves, regardless of their sex, and make sure they are geared up to know how to live in the world by the time they grow up. Little boys shouldn't be left out of knowing how to do laundry, or dishes, or cleaning up the house. Just like little girls shouldn't be left out of running the lawnmower, or helping to build a treehouse. Little boys shouldn't be discouraged from playing house, or with dolls. Just like little girls shouldn't be discouraged from rough-housing or with action figures. And let them wear whatever they want for crying out loud!"

Post transition, I've been able to target the real source of all my discomfort, which I am now officially diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. I'm still really insecure about myself as a whole, but I'm learning to accept that it's because of my head, not because of me or who I am as a person. 

I think that my previous experiences of dating other women may have influenced it, but really it was a whole lot of confusion. I never really had a tight hold on who I am, so I think that I was desperate to hold on to any possible answers to my struggles. I think I was desperately looking for a reason why I was so messed up because I was undiagnosed until much later in my life. (I'd rather not get into details here.)

As for my advice: please, PLEASE, consider everything. Consider if it could only be a phase. Consider if it's influenced by porn. Consider if there's an underlying mental illness that hasn't been addressed yet. And I would say to actively look for reasons NOT to transition instead of reasons TO. Only because transitioning can be a horrible mistake if you suddenly regret it later. Give it longer than a year to resolve and then pursue transition, but PLEASE think it through and think it though again. And again. And again. This is the only body you have, please don't permanently change it for no good reason. 

I never really had a problem with myself when I dated other women back then. Really I was hell-bent on protecting THEM from any bullying. (I guess I was always the ""top"" in the relationship. IDK.) It was a long time ago. And I was bullied relentlessly for many other things including my sexual orientation. 

I don't know if this is worth adding, but I'm a social reject. (For many reasons.) I prefer baggy, alternative, GNC styles and I have several piercings/tattoos. Being more rugged/edgy doesn't make me any less of a woman, neither does bath bombs and painting my nails ""affirm my femaleness."" A lot of the things I see in the current transgender fad is that it showed up nearly overnight and that people cross-dress or have very alternative styles much like the Emo/Goth/Scenekid phases of the late 2000's. I figure it's worth adding that many people want to stand out in unique ways and experiment with clothes/body modifications, and that, in a way, the transgender movement is what happens when you force medical procedures to play a part in identity formation. I just want people to keep in mind that there really isn't much of a difference between these two countercultures, except for the fact that the latter has the ability to make so many things go wrong. (Like the health problems I see other posts mentioning.)

These divides won't be breached unless a level of understanding is established. And that can only happen if we engage in meaningful discourse like this! 

I don't like calling myself a label really cuz it's easy to be painted the same color as the few rotten apples in the bunch if someone decides to criticize what the group originally stood for. But that doesn't mean I believe people should be silenced for their opinions. 

(Sorry in advance for the incoming flattery) I think the kind of bravery you showed in challenging this group is something that's rarely seen and I truly admire it when such criticism is reciprocated with genuine respect. It's something I wish I could encounter more often."
truebisexuals,fiqqe8s,t1_fiqp8a0,1582649764.0,"I'm a horrible person to ask this cuz, to me, if someone is actually joking, they can say whatever they want. Context is important in any joke after all. But, I can understand people getting upset over it. 

And absolutely! People deserve the right to use whatever labels they want for themselves. I don't dispute that, I never have. 

This might catch me alot of backlash, but I'll plow on through. In the true spirit of the Freedom of Speech, I believe everyone should be free to speak their truth. Even if their truth is intolerance of a trait of someone. Where I NEVER think it's ok is if someone says something along the lines of ""ha ha yeah I wanna kill all pansexuals/bisexuals! BuT i'M tOtAlLy JoKiNg."" That's something I consider dangerous."
truebisexuals,fiqoflc,t1_fiqnkfe,1582648617.0,"I mean, the flair is clearly stating it's a joke. Plus, I think that the people here are a little sour about another title for a sexuality that so closely resembles bisexuality (but isn't) yet it's being pinned on bisexuals in order to ""correct them"" in today's progressive society. 

Also, thank you for responding!"
truebisexuals,fiqngvi,t3_f9cep9,1582648042.0,?? How is anyone here doing that? I ask cuz I'm honestly confused.

schizophrenia,fgw9hc0,t3_f0pemb,1581158569.0,"I don't know what you should do from a professional standpoint, but with how my husband handled me, he sorta let me figure it out on my own. If what I was saying/doing/believing wasn't doing anyone/myself any harm, he let me talk it out with him. 

As far as getting me to go get help, I think I had to pursue it on my own. He was very concerned, and he always discussed those concerns with me, but ultimately it was me who had to decide that his concerns were reason enough to go get help. 

I'm sorry if my response isn't very helpful. Of course, handling someones delusions depends on what those delusions are and just how severe the illness is. But I would agree universally that straight up rejecting someones delusions when they work themselves up enough to trust you with them is probably not the best idea."

GenderCritical,fgvb6bc,t3_f0klcp,1581143046.0,"As someone who once was trans, I look back at that time as one of the most stereotype-ridden existences of my life. 

And it's funny cuz I realized something recently. I wear typically ""masculine"" clothing and I have short hair, but I recently picked up painting my nails again. Had I done this about a year and a half ago, I would have lost my mind cuz my nails would give away that I'm **nOt ReAlLly A mAn**. 

Everyone in those communities, or in support of them, like to think that they're breaking gender stereotypes when really, they're adhering to them more than ever."
