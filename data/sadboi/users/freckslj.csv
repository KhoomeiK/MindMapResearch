My heart rate is naturally high AND I’m recently back into running after knee surgeries. The doctors told me I’d never run without pain again. And it can be painful but mostly I’m super anxious worrying that my knees will dislocate while running. Which raises my heart rate. 

It’s kind of sad but I’m now that person that everyone knows has the high heart rate because I basically announced it in the lobby before classes for awhile. Even if just talking to a friend loudly, I think people caught on and now don’t mention it around me.

It seemed silly but it worked for me. I had to consciously asses my body and current space and then change it. So and unconsciously it made me recognize I wasn’t IN my past but I was in a safe place in my future. 
Not sure if it would work for others but it’s something I still do today. Even when I’m just stressed or overwhelmed.

ptsd,f5vli7p,t3_dpfdst,1572492305.0,"First and foremost, I am so sorry you’ve experienced this. 

Second, waiver or declination forms are now recognized as a horrible practice because so many survivors sign them while they are still dealing with the trauma and fear. I know that that’s not much or helpful to hear but know that if one day, you changed your mind, you might be able to fight it or at least bring attention to the horrible practice. 

Third, it sounds to me like safety planning is essential. I know you’re struggling to call a therapist but what about a Rape Crisis Center. If you want to message me where you are, I’ll be able to look at what’s available. But RCCs usually have attorneys, advocates, and counselors. A counselor may not be what you’re ready for yet. But an advocate can talk to you about the waiver. About a protective order (you signed a criminal waiver, that shouldn’t prevent civil action) and although protective/peace orders are often viewed negatively because it’s difficult for police to enforce. But it’s a start. It documents what he’s done to you in the legal system and It doesn’t create a police investigation unless HE violates it. 
Retaliation is still a reasonable fear. So that’s where safety planning is key. Even if you don’t go with any civil legal action. 

I could ramble on about these options because I work in this field. But instead, just know you’re worth so much more than he made you feel. And if you want help with resources or have questions, you can message me."
loseit,f5s7u4i,t3_dp00g3,1572415586.0,"Thanks for sharing Pat. This is long, but I feel it’s valuable. But I suppose we all feel that way about our own stories...  💁🏻‍♀️
Almost a year ago I was in a similar spot. But I had never lost weight. I just realized how big I had gotten and how awful I felt.  My recommendation is to make sure to find something that works for you. So if it’s the elliptical, great. The treadmill at a 2% incline, awesome. Weights that give you an amazing feeling and a boost to your calorie burn, keep at it.  It doesn’t have to be what people say is “best for weight loss” it has to be what’s best for you. 
Don’t be afraid to try classes either. For me, it was orange theory fitness. I realized that I had always been in shape because I did best on sport teams and having a coach. So I needed the environment of someone telling me what to do and the entire group is doing it together. I was terrified going in because of how out of shape and big I was, but it worked for me and never did anyone make me feel ashamed. 

So again, find what works. And add a little every day (walk up a flight of stairs and then take the elevator the rest of the way up and then add a floor or two each week..). And keep going. 
And don’t be a bully. And by that I mean, talk to yourself the way you would a friend.  I consciously acknowledge my negative self talk as a downward spiral, it’s when “I couldn’t run the entire treadmill block I’m a failure” turns into “You’ll never run like other people do. You’ll probably walk more and more and lose all your endurance and fail and gain everything back and hate yourself and then you’ll be homeless and die”. It’s always ridiculous and ends in something that isn’t logical. So I have to catch the downward spiral and force it up. So, Change your thoughts to “when I started this I couldn’t run at all, now I’m running 10 mins straight, I can probably get up to 12 mins” etc etc. 
it’s a technique used in 12 step recovery program for women (by Stephanie Covington). I think it can be used in a variety of ways and is not just for women. And you can find exercises on line to help with visualizing and creating your “spiral”. 

Anyway. I know that was a lot. But overall I just want to say good luck. You got this. You have been successful before and you will be successful again. Treat yourself with love while still challenging yourself!"

It come sand goes now that I’m doing better. But when it starts up, it’s hard to deal with and overcome because I then get anxious that I’m getting sick again on top of everything else. 

Best of luck. When this happens I have learned to not worry about what I’m eating. But to just eat when I do actually feel hungry and eat what sounds good to me. As in, don’t force down an entire meal because I “know” I should. But just eat whatever I feel confident I can keep down."

I also feel compelled to share my story. It’s a little different. not addiction or ED related... but. My PTSD and OCD have kept me from joining a gym for years because there’s no all women gyms around me since I moved. I would go sometimes and just sit in my car and cry at the thought of being around men and feeling vulnerable in that space.

Otf terrified me. And I avoided taking classes with male coaches for a long time. But after awhile. I felt similar to you. I wanted to be strong and powerful and I forced myself to do class with male coaches. (It helped that I became friends with a great female coach that encouraged me and reassured me that I was safe) Since then, one of my fav coaches is male and today he got me so motivated I PRed on the rower ( and also fell off because the seat didn’t move with my butt... but that’s another story 🤦🏻‍♀️)

ptsd,evi356a,t1_evi2iaj,1564536282.0,"I’m glad to hear you got that closure for the session. But something isn’t sitting right for you. And I think you have two things you should do: discuss with your therapist next time that things kind of crumbled around you after you left the session so you need to re-evaluate the closing of the session. 
And consider starting with a small t. This is what I did so that I could adjust to EMDR before jumping all in. And I got to decide if it was working for me. 

In the meantime, I think you’re doing the right thing. Use your known coping mechanisms and reach out for support. And don’t forgot to really checkin with yourself - don’t dive into the thoughts but just check your breathing and heart rate and change scenery if you are feeling overwhelmed. The therapist I saw right after my trauma when I was really young told me to change my scenery when I started to panic. If I was sitting, stand up and walk. If I was standing, take a seat or lay down and breathe. If I was in the bedroom, go to the the living room. And with each room change mentally or verbally describe the room I moved to so I was truly acknowledging that I was safe and in the present."
ptsd,evi2c0q,t3_ck0bvr,1564535911.0,"Did you start this with discussing closing each session? Creating your safe space and imagery with your therapist? And did you get to sit in the space for several mins before the EMDR was stopped today?

Edit: want to add that I’m sorry the first session was hard. And what sucks is that therapy in general is hard. And that means you’re working, which is good. But the things I mentioned above were superrrrrr important to me when I did EMDR."
orangetheory,ev8ns8r,t3_cipoe3,1564285310.0,I was feeling super burnt out this week and took a few days off. I’m not sure how my body is feeling but seems like a pretty basic day to see where I’m at.
orangetheory,euqx0yl,t1_euqisbq,1563986511.0,"Same! What’s really hard for me though is I’ve stopped straightening. I want to get my curls back and right now I’m in a funk of frizz, some curls, some waves. 
It’s a real struggle."
progresspics,euqob0o,t1_euofy5c,1563982425.0,Thanks! I never realized how much weight my face was holding until I did this! It’s insane. :)
progresspics,eunv4fk,t1_eunfkko,1563933928.0,Ah thank you! I definitely was in both those pics 😊 struggling lately but that’s life!
orangetheory,eunn7oo,t3_cgwb55,1563930985.0,"I’ve been feeling like I’m just not the same at OTF lately. Like my legs are weak and do t have the power/speed they did a few weeks ago. I think it’s maybe that I’m overdoing it and during wedding season (MOH in two weddings - so much $$ and drinks and travel) that I need to build back to where I was and take better care of myself. 

But I will say some aspects of the template do seem more difficult. And I’m pretty much just talking about the inclines and longer AOs. Oh and that orange arc? That too."
progresspics,eun2im6,t3_cgusau,1563923415.0,♥️♥️♥️ congrats! There aren’t any words to describe how amazing this is!
orangetheory,eu9sus7,t1_eu9rimn,1563589810.0,Also my first 90 min and I’m very concerned 😂
aww,eu6khoo,t1_eu621s3,1563502375.0,Came here to say the same thing!!!
intermittentfasting,eu6kdzq,t3_cf0mw7,1563502305.0,Wow! Congrats! This is amazing. In both the weight loss and your hair 🥰
aww,eu3gp6j,t3_cekzy2,1563414209.0,This makes my heart so happy. Thank you 🥰
orangetheory,eu2ugwk,t3_cegooj,1563398397.0,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 absolutely love this
progresspics,eu2u420,t3_cehfa2,1563398167.0,Damn girl!!! My jaw dropped. This is amazing. I’m obsessed with this progress. As someone else said you don’t look like you’re at 300!!! Congrats!
orangetheory,etekncm,t1_etdgin1,1562735956.0,"Ohhh so glad I’ve been scrolling and saw this nugget of info. I’m trying to up my base and maintained 5.0 for the entire class (6.0 pushes, with a real struggle) and those all outs were death. So I may try decreasing that to make sure I build and get steady/strong at my base. Thanks!!!"
progresspics,etejh29,t3_cbb535,1562734793.0,"I want to comment a few things. First. Great job - you look great! I started around the same start weight and I’m hoping to see 170 soon but feeling like it’s not possible lately so I’m glad to see it is!! 

Also. Like someone else said, Love the tats and the dress!"
aww,etaj06b,t1_etai9u5,1562621368.0,"I hope that’s the case. But the reason I adopted huckleberry is because I moved to an apartment by myself which meant no more roommate and no more kitten. My cat, Sawyer, became so depressed without her that I was sleeping on the floor next to his food bowls because he would only eat if I was next to him. The vet finally suggested I adopt another cat for him. And that’s how I ended up with huckleberry. 
And sawyer hated him at first, of course 😂"
loseit,etaief8,t3_caoter,1562620959.0,"Oh my gosh - I was in this place not too long ago. I joined Orangetheory and was terrified to take my free class. Then terrified to take the free VIP classes at the new studio. And then to just go to class. Sometimes I’m still nervous but once I get there, it fades away. 

I also relate because when I started OTF I was a power walker. And I used to be a really good long distance runner before knee surgeries and health issues . And the idea of being a PW was so upsetting to me. But once I got into things, I started to set my goals. And I saw the improvements in my power walking - increased inclines, higher speed, whatever it was. And I realized that yeah, I was power walking. But my fitness was improving and I was meeting goals. And that’s a big deal. 
And now I’m running. 

The point I’m trying to make is - push yourself to go and it’ll become habit. And you’ll see your improvements and allow yourself to celebrate those achievements! Focus on those goals - because everyone else is only focusing on their goals. 

Also, I used to cry when I’d go to the gym with my boyfriend and one day he got so frustrated he said “you know, you’re really selfish” and I was beyond offended until he explained that everyone who goes to the gym is going for their own goals - and if I truly believe that people are more concerned about me than their goals they want to meet at the gym they pay money for, then I must have a big ego to think my insecurities take up that much space in the minds of others. 

It hit hard, but god it is true. 

Good luck! I found a class environment was what I needed so definitely try those yoga and Pilates classes, try new things, and stick with what you enjoy - and if anyone has a problem with that, fuck em."
progresspics,etah69a,t3_cap0f4,1562620132.0,"Great work! Thanks for posting - it’s helpful to me  as I’m currently right at your start weight and feel like I’ll never see the 150s. 

You look great!"
aww,et9obkt,t1_et9mnuo,1562601688.0,"Thanks for the tips. But this boy loves the foster kittens. We’ve tried to keep the kittens in the bedroom when we’re at work but this guy (Huck) opens the bedroom door so he can be with them. He cuddles with them whenever he can and loves to teach them grooming and other cat behaviors. 

We also spend so much time with him and our other adult cat. Making sure they don’t feel left out. And they’re sleeping spots are never taken by a kitten (this guy will always have my pillow to sleep at my head). 
And since we came back from the vet he just wants to play with the kittens again.  The problem isn’t that he doesn’t get attention - it seems to be that he wants it when he wants it and he wants the best of both worlds - constantly playing and cuddling kittens while having human pets and love at the same time. 

We’re genuinely worried he’ll be heart broken when the kitties leave!"
progresspics,et9ib6d,t3_calqqn,1562597591.0,Looking great! Good job!
aww,et9f460,t1_et90i5d,1562595317.0,🥰
aww,et9f3ri,t1_et8ppu5,1562595308.0,Thanks. He’s soooo handsome and friendly 😊 I’m going to have to post some more photos!
aww,et9f2fh,t1_et8tfln,1562595281.0,"The confusing part is that he lovessss the kittens. We tried keeping them in the bedroom so they had less chance of getting into wires and trouble when we were both at work. Quickly learned that Huck was opening the bedroom door because he wanted to play! 
He just demands his own attention when he wants it! 😂🙄"
progresspics,et8gu36,t3_caf00e,1562556076.0,"Congrats! You look great! Did you lose most of the weight during a smaller  Timeframe within 5 year or truly stayed steady for the 5 years? 

I also fully appreciate seeing that it is possible to reach my goal of 150 lbs. when lately I’ve been feeling like it’s just not possible for me."
orangetheory,et4hqad,t1_et3vkfg,1562450453.0,"I was going to say the same thing about people “running hot”. 
I had your exact experience when I started (I was getting in the 30s and 40s for splats) I’ve had to accept that I have a higher resting heart rate and don’t think I’ll ever be someone earning in the teens. 
I did see a change and more of a bell curve (still in the 20s for splats though) after several months and now that I’ve increased my base pace, I’m back to higher splat points again. 

One thing that one of the coaches at my studio said was to stop looking at the screen. I got so frustrated that I was always in the red and orange and it would only get my heart rate up more to be frustrated. I focus on how I feel, not what the screen says. 

I have been too lazy to get my algorithm personalized. But I’d love to hear if it people have liked making that change."
orangetheory,esr7tou,t3_c8w8j9,1562218567.0,"I’d say that you could use the OTbeat app. Then select out of studio workout. It’ll tell you if it can detect your HRM. I’d imagine you’ll need to walk around your apartment some as I’m not sure he range. 
Also, this will only work if you left your HRM on. 

Good luck."
orangetheory,erektp4,t1_ere1pn8,1560786601.0,I’m looking for a new handband because I need to wash mine after each class. I would love to buy the same one I have but can’t find it. My problem is headbands slipping off my head easily. Do junk headbands have any grips to stay on or do you find it isn’t even a problem with this brand?
progresspics,erd8mfw,t3_c1g7to,1560734202.0,"Wow! Congrats! And thanks for sharing. I had a similar SW and have dropped into onederland but honestly feel like my goal of 150 is something ill never see. 
I’m glad to see it is possible!"
