She never responded but I ended up getting a B in the class instead of failing so obviously it worked. I think you just have to show them you really did study and care about the course and aren’t just making an excuse to get more study time"

We’ve been together for three years now and it’s the healthiest most loving relationship I’ve ever been in, but I really believe that it comes from me loving myself and knowing how I deserve to be treated. He has never even raised his voice at me and when we do argue we resolve it before we go to bed, we go on fun adventures together, and push each other to try new things and grow as individuals."

boulder,foyigyf,t1_foyi7rw,1588173117.0,Exactly. And when you have no home or place to stay it’s very easy to rack up illegal camping tickets and end up in jail for literally trying to survive. We make homelessness illegal without giving people any other option which forces them to break the law.

They will be fined, they will have to decide to use their money for resources or paying the fine, if they can’t pay the fine they will be imprisoned. Those are the facts. If you know you’d be doing the same thing if you were homeless why criminalize someone else for doing that?"

Hidradenitis,fj8wa53,t3_fc4kpx,1583124000.0,"Ever since I moved into an apartment by myself I spend most of my time nude, and the amount of cysts I got went down dramatically. I really recommend sleeping naked because it reduces rubbing and sweating."
cuboulder,fiyg3df,t1_fiy8a9o,1582838734.0,"Homelessness is the issue not homeless people you fucking twat. If we had actual mental health care for folks, shelters for LGBTQ youth, and took care of veterans there would be almost no one left on the streets. 

It’s smooth brains like you that don’t do shit to help the situation just place blame on some of the most marginalized people in our community."
cuboulder,fiy0nmx,t1_fixzht4,1582830154.0,"First off, you’re a cunt who should literally eat shit off the bottom of a shoe. 

Second, statistically you are more likely to be assaulted by a frat bro, most likely by you specifically for how flagrantly you blame victims, than any homeless person. 

You don’t know shit, you don’t have facts you just have a flat booty, little brain, and scrawny ass calves, pussy."
cuboulder,fiwcsv4,t1_fiwb3kb,1582781449.0,"The atmosphere on campus towards the homeless is super hostile. It’s hard to even talk to people because they assume the worst from anyone who is forced to sleep on the streets. 

This is my first pro homeless comment on this sub that hasn’t been downvoted to oblivion."

They need support, not condemnation if we ever want to solve the homelessness crisis."
AskWomen,fiayda3,t3_f7faob,1582310857.0,I have and it went so wrong. I ripped off the paper but the wax was stuck to my skin and extremely painful to rip off. I really recommend going to a nice professional because some of the products they use barely hurt at all.
AskWomen,fi7vjxo,t3_f6ugtu,1582228947.0,"For months my manager at a retail store was scheduling me on days I could not work because of my class schedule, and other events I’d requested off for. I dropped plans multiple times to come to work on days I was supposed to have off, but made sure to have off the day of a friend’s dance recital. I checked the schedule every day leading up to make sure I had off, and reminded my manager regularly I could not stay that day, but on the day of, the schedule changed and I was told I had to work a double because they had messed up the schedule. I reminded her of my plans and she didn’t care at all, even though we were fully staffed. 

I stayed at my register until my original clock out time, but a small line formed right as I was about to leave. I didn’t care. I took off my apron, put it on the counter, walked up to my manager and told her I quit. 

The store was notorious for taking advantage of college kids and has a huge turnover rate so I wasn’t too upset about losing the job. The next week I found another retail job at a store I love and have been there for three years. Looking back it was the best decision I ever made."
AskWomen,fi4dm8l,t3_f6cvv7,1582139053.0,"My partner has never yelled at me and it’s been just about three years of dating. I never imagined being in such a healthy relationship where communication is so easy after dating a series of abusers. 

He says that his parents never argued in front of him or his siblings and never raised their voices to each other. Because he hasn’t raised his voice, I found that I don’t raise mine at him, and stay much calmer when we do rarely argue."

cuboulder,fhuqojd,t3_f4vt4a,1581889190.0,"There is a DSA club on campus for democratic socialists that does a lot around elections and ISC an international socialist organization that does a lot of work around issues on campus and the country in general, and IMT, a socialist theory club that does readings on theory. I’d try going to all the meetings and seeing which one works best with you. 

Even though people like to believe that CU is very progressive, it isn’t. I hope you can find a place that feels comfortable!"
