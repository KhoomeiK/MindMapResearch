UniUK,f2kcy5o,t3_d7q2qq,1570283904.0,"I'd recommend it for sure! Just entered my second year here. If you're studying comp sci you'll be based on Bay Campus which has brand-new state of the art facilities.

It's also a great uni for international students - in fact I know numerous people here who are from Kenya.

The night life is excellent I'd say, defintely one of the better cities in the UK for clubbing, etc. 

The teaching has been great for the most part on my course (engineering), and the course itself has been really interesting, so I'd assume that comp sci is of similar quality.

Let me know if you have any more questions!"

PublicFreakout,ey2aehp,t3_cuytbl,1566732512.0,"As much as I'd likely disagree with many of his views, I don't think he deserved to be confronted like that, he wasn't saying anything abusive, and as far as I could tell from the video, wasn't being particularly loud.

Would have been better if those people approached him and offered to have a civilised debate with him."
UniUK,extjok1,t1_extg2kl,1566569979.0,"I'd say the main difficulty is being organised and managing your time. It's definitely a commitment but as long as you stay organised you should be fine. 

Usually the courses are graded out of 45 credits. For me each module was worth 3 credits, so I did 15 modules altogether. In addition there are 5 ungraded study skills modules that you simply have to pass by meeting all the grading criteria. So technically 60 credits overall. 

Each module is marked as either fail, pass, merit or distinction. My degree wanted 30 credits at distinction and 12 at merit from memory, so there was some room for error."
UniUK,extfw45,t3_cu8vpr,1566568125.0,"Hi, I'd definitely recommend doing the access course. Since you generally only get one shot at uni, it makes sense to do something you don't have doubts about. I completed my access course last year, got onto my degree without having to do a foundation year.

 I'd definitely check with the uni that does the degree the entry requirements if you do the access course though.

Another thing worth mentioning, access courses are actually really good preparation for uni, you'll most likely learn how to write essays and reports, and how to reference, as well as how to manage your time."

At some point after some further study and contemplation I started believing, and have started praying daily."

depression,etmph8b,t3_ccaxvm,1562965344.0,"I feel you man, I think there are certainly definitive changes you need to make, be it taking yourself along to a new club or meetup, or changing your career pathway. Point is, the world is still your oyster, but you feel very confined and hopeless because that's what depression does to us. I've been feeling the same way lately.

Tell us more about yourself, what's your background?"
braces,etfusvg,t1_etfrdt3,1562778029.0,"It gets better, after a few days or a week you'll be used to the feeling of them and the discomfort should be reduced a little. I still have the same problem to an extent when I get them adjusted, though not as bad as when I first got braces.

I generally try to stick to things that can be eaten in small bites - rice and pasta dishes are great, burgers not so much."
UniUK,etf3evz,t3_cbdlig,1562758703.0,"I'd say, assuming the two universities have similar credentials, the main advantage to moving somewhere new would be, as you say, new experience. However, I'm sure you will still have ample opportunity to meet new people and get involved in new things where you are.

I suppose the other thing you might feel you're missing out on is the social life that comes with living in halls, but from personal experience it's not a real biggie if you have a good social life back home (halls can also be very pricey!).

Another thing to factor in would be travel costs and extra things you may need to buy when moving to a new place."

TooAfraidToAsk,epzk6qc,t3_bwjh1k,1559667265.0,"This! I'd like a relationship right now, but only if it could work around my work life and my own downtime (that's not to say I'm just looking for a casual relationship mind). Particularly when it comes to my studies - I won't have such a busy social life or romantic life that my grades start to slip.

Perhaps I'll just have to find someone who is in the same boat, and then things will work out."
mentalhealth,epzgylu,t1_epzgny6,1559665467.0,"Yes it's a good mindset to be in, and it makes sense too - we are ultimately in control of ourselves, not just how we think but also how we react to any problems thrown at us."
