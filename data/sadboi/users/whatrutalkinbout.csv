that jump is bigger in my opinion than a 8-9 (not claiming an 8 because i really struggle to categorize myself) 

the way i see it because this sub is primarily looks related the benefits of being “high value” truthfully go beyond this sub. a woman who has it together and a great career as well as personality does have more “value” than someone who’s attractive but doesn’t have that."
