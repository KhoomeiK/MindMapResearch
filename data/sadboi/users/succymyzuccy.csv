teenagers,fmfpyfo,t3_fuw0ka,1586032418.0,"this. a lot of people think it’s fine to be fat. if you’re a little chubby it’s alright, that’s pretty common and healthy, but if you’re overweight, that’s super unhealthy. like you’re literally dying. some people, like my mother for example, can’t lose weight because of health issues, but if you are ABLE to lose weight, being fat is not something to be proud of.

edit: the same thing with being skinny. most skinny people are born that way and can’t really change it, but if it’s not a permanent defect, please get help. there are resources."
