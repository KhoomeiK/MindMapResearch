Gatineau,fqbdzcn,t1_fqbd2ab,1589235232.0,"Wow thanks for the great reply! 

I turned my old garbage can into a composter but the sod I dug up is full of dandelions, would that be a problem? I also believe i have too much sod for my can. 

The rototiller is a fantastic idea, but I wondered about the grass that I was churning into the earth and whether or not that would be a problem later on. You’re telling me it wouldn’t be which is cool. 

We live near the gatineau airport which has some green space around it. I just don’t want to face a fine for dumping it. We also live very near an eco centre so i could call and see if they will take it but i’d rather have a free solution.

Thank you for all your suggestions. I will consider them for sure."

omad,fnsuljc,t1_fnstf2q,1587229092.0,"Hey there. I’m going to try to eat at about 10 and 5. I’m not sure if developing bodies should eat this way but might be something for you to look into. Are you able to cut out processed foods/sugar instead? I realise you may live with your parents and may not be totally in control of your meals. 
What works is calorie restriction, and eating only two or one meal a day helps with that for me. You are still quite young though so you can’t restrict too much, plus you are only considered slightly overweight if you aren’t super muscular. Might help to track what you’re eating in order to familiarise yourself with the nutritional value of the foods you’re eating. The above is called carb manager and it’s free to use. 2k calories might be okay for you to shoot for but again, considering you are still developing, I have no clue if this is accurate. 
Please consider other people’s opinions as well since I am far from an expert at this."

I had issues going to the bathroom on keto but since I’ve introduced these it’s been better. I still max out at 25 to 30 grams of carbs per day. 

I also eat a lot of cabbage and kimchi. Both low in calories and help move things along.
