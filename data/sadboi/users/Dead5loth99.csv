kotakuinaction2,fmlme1k,t1_fmjo9jv,1586189226.0,"Because Nomura along with fellow hack Nojima and Kitase, are just 100% subvert expectations anime bullshit these days. Even back to FF8 they were like this. They think making things convoluted as possible is good storytelling. That's why in FF8 there is like 20 plot twists. Oh the sorceress is not the reeeaall villain, it's actually this other sorceress that time travels. Also the original sorceress was actually the foster mom of all the main characters. Also Rinoa is actually a sorceress herself! And Laguna is Squalls dad! And don't get me started on Kingdom Hearts. KH1 and 2 were great because of simplicity, KH2 still took it a little too far, by making Ansem actually be another guy, and the reeeaalll Ansem is this other guy. But then they went crazy with 7 spinoff games complicating the story with time travel and alternate version of people and organization members being thousands of years old and even more secret organizations with people in hoods controlling everything. So since FF7 didn't have enough bullshit alternate timelines and time travel, then Nomura and Nojima just had to insert it to make the story much better! (And FF7 already had alternate timelines/personalities in the form of Zack Fair being the ""real"" Cloud, which was an idea created by Nojima. Now whether you think this is stupid or not, is up to opinion, but it just shows how long this has been happening for.)"
