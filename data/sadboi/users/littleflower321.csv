books,fqzohkw,t3_glberg,1589771758.0,That’s my way of knowing when I’m still pretty depressed. I’ve been trying to avoid admitting it but I know I’m not as much better as I’d like because I can’t get back into reading yet. Hopefully soon.

Sober,fptwr39,t3_gf8tha,1588899817.0,"I was 32. I realized that if I kept drinking I was going to lose my husband and kids and I could not live with that thought. Once that sank in, I stopped and never looked back. It will be 7 years this June, and I’m still happily married with our two awesome kids."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fma9ogu,t1_fma3j9r,1585887501.0,Yes we can! Best wishes to you and your family.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fm2wgfa,t1_fm2jypd,1585707015.0,I definitely feel better on the days the weather is better. We haven’t had great weather lately which I’m sure isn’t helping this feeling. Thanks for the suggestions!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fm1rbfv,t1_fm1r3mg,1585683606.0,Oh that’s a great idea. Thanks!!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fm1qe6q,t1_fm1nao8,1585683129.0,"Thanks, that is helpful. I think having it written somewhere will make it more real and therefore something I’m more likely to do."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fm1qax1,t1_fm1i1yw,1585683082.0,My daughter and I actually did some yoga! Definitely helped to make me feel like I accomplished something.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fkcsfis,t3_fhor9w,1584060098.0,Locked in a suitcase is what we do. We also have a bag with a lock that we keep in a random cardboard box at the back of the closet behind a bunch of stuff. Just make it hard to find.

latebloomerlesbians,fhepxzi,t1_fhep0n9,1581527503.0,Haha so true. From now I’m referring to this part of my life as my Big Lesbian Emergency. Seems about right.
latebloomerlesbians,fhem1z1,t3_f2q6ba,1581525232.0,I read this as Big Lesbian Emergency and could not fathom what that might mean. Makes much more sense now.
AnxietyDepression,fhcp7do,t3_f2hzc1,1581467797.0,"I do know that in my experience being on one drug for a long time can eventually lead to it not working for me anymore. Sometimes I’ve had to just adjust my dosage and other times I’ve had to switch completely.  Zoloft (sertraline) was one of those that stopped working for me as well as Effexor. I thought it had happened with Cymbalta as well but I took a break from it for over a year (I was stable at the time, I would not have done it otherwise, and wouldn’t recommend just stopping anything) and now am back on it.  I also have treatment resistant depression, so my experience might be different. Hope you can find some relief and things get better."
AnxietyDepression,fgrq2ua,t1_fgrjiis,1581053779.0,Yeah but that dread...I hate waking up with that feeling. I hope you find some relief/balance soon. I’m holding out hope that maybe once spring comes it’ll ease up a bit.
Anxiety,fgre7t1,t3_ezw6we,1581044646.0,"Yes!  I had high hopes of going into this year better than before but alas anxiety has f’ed that up.  Nice to see I’m not alone, but damn I didn’t realize there were so many of us dealing with this right now."
AnxietyDepression,fgr5xog,t3_ezz02i,1581038950.0,"I can definitely relate. I’m not manic at night per day but it seems that past a certain time I get into this “other” mood and don’t want it to end. I too fight going to sleep because I like the feeling of that time. I’m also really having a hard time getting up and feeling just generally terrible in the mornings. I’m not sure what the solution, or resolution I guess, is. I may try switching the timing of my medications to see if that helps. I hope you find a good solution. Maybe the new job will kind of force the change?"

Anxietyhelp,ffvo3m8,t1_ffvk8k7,1580268713.0,"I try to turn my brightness down and have it on dark mode which does seem to help. I think there is another setting that changes it to a night time mode as well. That might help.
Edit - it’s called night shift on iPhone, under Display and Brightness in settings"
AnxietyDepression,ffrxtxi,t3_euroe2,1580168348.0,"I have not, though I have given it a lot of thought. My provider is going to have me try low dose naltrexone to see if that helps. I’m starting tonight so I probably won’t know for a while. Just wanted to let you know of the option since I had no clue about it until a few weeks ago. Maybe ask your doc about it. Best of luck."

It was ridiculously hard those first days, weeks, even a couple of months, but it just got better and better and better. Sounds like you know what you need to do and you’ve got a lot of people rooting for you. Don’t let the bad feelings talk you out of staying sober. You’ve got this!!"
