lonely,flqix2c,t3_fq3o2o,1585396580.0,I can also recognize with this feeling. I used to make fake names and fake friends to help me get through my loneliness. I’ve even lied to people about having some of them. I’ll never understand it fully it’s almost like something that we use to fill the void and try to get ourselves to feel whole again.
lonely,flqirgb,t3_fl619j,1585396414.0,I can recognize with this. Or even if I hug anyone even if I haven’t been longing a hug from them. Anytime someone says I love you or tries to give me affection I try and avoid it because it’s too much for me to try and handle.
lonely,flq0zdh,t3_fqazki,1585375046.0,Considering that every girl in your area is fake. I’d try to find someone on Reddit or any other social media platform. Plus with online relationships it’s easier to find an emotional connection w people online whereas in real life you’ll be persuaded by body images
lonely,flpxadv,t3_fqdao9,1585371559.0,I understand. I’ve gotten so accustomed to this feeling that it almost just feels like second nature for me to just move on and forget about that specific person.
lonely,flpwoep,t3_fqaz3s,1585371024.0,"I feel this exact same way + I’ve tried all the therapeutic techniques that you’ve listed. and I will always be dreaming of the day where I can wake up next to someone and care for, cherish, and love them. And for them to feel the same way would be the best feeling. I’m getting butterflies even just thinking of it right now. I’m not sure what it ever was. But I could never get myself to not feel so lonely. I’ve been longing for a friendship and everlasting bond for what it seems like forever. I also don’t think that the personal things I’m going through right now help with my whole self isolation and loneliness bit. ^ usually don’t like to spill/ talk about myself too much but here we go! whew! that was a weight off my chest. This sounds cliche as all hell but in the meantime keep your head up. Just think about the day that you finally have what you want and how gratifying that day will be. Don’t give up! Believe in yourself and hold onto those things that make you special until someone eventually recognizes their merit!"

relationship_advice,fjdq7p0,t1_fgrfgo1,1583257109.0,This is something I can relate with — if I’ve read this correctly. A lot of the female friends that I’ve ever had do the exact same thing! It’s also why I’ll never get along with women. There’s always this sense of comparison in an atmosphere like that. Whereas when I befriend guys I feel that there is nothing to be compared. Women are super competitive about anything and everything that can can compete with. I have yet to figure out why but I’ve come to the realization of it being something psychological about the same sex and primitive competition instincts.

amiugly,fakd0pt,t3_e9jbd6,1576165032.0,"In a sort of way, I agree. When I see myself in the mirror. I think that I’m the most beautiful person. But as soon as I step foot outside, I feel like I’m the same as others and it destroys my confidence. I love being the different one but as soon as I see someone who looks similar to me, or has the same color hair, eyes, or shoes. I slowly start to fade into a depression again and start thinking about how nothing matters. I’ve started to channel out these emotions, slowly though. As soon as a negative universal thought makes its way.. I distract and distance myself then move on."
CasualConversation,fakcbtc,t3_e9mdug,1576164688.0,"Yeah I feel the same way. It’s just the “coach” attitude I guess. Because they’re a coach they’re supposed to be naggy, and demanding. I don’t know just a thought."

hiphop101,fakb9je,t3_e98opr,1576164164.0,"The only reason as to why hip hop has shifted to trap for the while is because that is what the majority wants. Good thing that we have innovative thinkers in the game right now that are trying to shift the sound. But for rn I feel that hip hop will stay in this trap era because that’s what the majority listens to/ can vibe with. Me personally, I’m not a huge fan of gangster rap, I’m more of a fan of projects that include detailed concepts. And that you have to study to truly understand the purpose of the art. Interesting question. I also feel that we are going to shift into more Cudi type music with this whole, “sad boy/ sad girl” craze that is going on right now."
