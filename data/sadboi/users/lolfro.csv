LucidDreaming,fkjabh6,t3_fhz47h,1584240355.0,"I have had the opposite where I dream of something chasing me then I become aware that I'm dreaming.

Recently, I dreamed I was being chased by a bear. It was gaining on me and I thought my only way out would be to fly. I started to float and became aware it was a dream and began freely flying through the sky. Another time a yeti was chasing me. I became aware it was a dream and faced it. I imagined it shrinking and it slowly became smaller until I could stomp on it. I just wandered around after that.

I think being chased pushes me into a slight fight or flight response and it makes me become aware although I have had way more dreams of being chased and not becoming lucid after.

But I have had one dream where I became lucid and started to fly around a lake. Halfway through this experience witches on brooms started to come after me. I just imagined going faster and lost them and continued to fly around.

Maybe becoming aware during a dream is a mild form of fight or flight or that when we are aware and awake we are alert and on the lookout for danger. Being on the lookout for danger manifests hostile characters or turns non hostiles hostile. I have not had regular characters turn hostile, they usually start out as such but I've only had 5ish lucid dreams. Just my thoughts. Who knows what's really happening in our gourds.

Cheers!"
LucidDreaming,fkj66a8,t3_figfs4,1584237228.0,"I think the thought processes we use to LD sometimes become regular subconscious thoughts. While they are about lucid dreams they are just ""tapes"" that have become old ironically.

For me lucid dreaming happens during an ongoing dream but I don't know all the methods so I won't say your way won't work, just sounds like what I do for an astral projection attempt. 

I have had one out of body experience but I didn't induce it and all my lucid dreams I just become aware during a dream, I don't induce them either so I'm not experienced."

But as long as you have speakers or headphones that have some sub you should be good for a while just starting out.

Additionally, Later you might want to get a laptop or pc with a good processor if you want to do a lot of heavy sound design. Serum seems to kick my pc in the shins. Even having it open causes things to go wrong. But just starting out you dont actually need anything but a computer and a DAW. 

Watch tutorials and if you can actually read the manual for some daws and plugins. While randomly pressing buttons is fun to experiment with you will have a much better understanding of everything if you learn what each knob really does.
