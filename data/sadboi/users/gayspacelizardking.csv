axolotls,fplrgwk,t3_gdy0ok,1588718062.0,"Hey! My axolotl looks a lot like yours (leucistic) and his gills are usually super pink, but when he's active (eating, swimming alot) they become bright red, and when he's mellow (sleeping, chilling) they become pale pink or almost white. Super normal for them to change a shade of color or two depending on their physical activity. Similarly his tail will also redden when he's active. They're just pale little guys so you can see the blood flow very easily"

BPD,fmgjari,t1_fmg92b2,1586050309.0,"I was once juggling the possibility even as multiple personalities but after much research I didnt identify with it at all (plus I'm sure my psych and therapist would have caught on). Its like different identities of me that had experiences that my mind cant fully remember or relate but I know I was there. I remembered everything up until I have a traumatic event, and then just kinda shove down that existence into some back part of my brain. Like that version of me is dead and gone, time to move on, I feel like a different me now? And it's not like im repressing just the trauma, I'm repressing everything I was and did till that point. But even when I say repressed, it's not like a full repression? Like I'm leveling up? It's so hard to put the feeling into words and even rereading this I know it doesnt make much sense lmao whoops"

BPD,fmg38sm,t3_fusz2m,1586040328.0,"so really funny, i came into this reddit specifically looking to see if anyone else had this same feeling!! i feel like every year or few year my brain like resets? its the only way i can explain it. like every bad event in my life is the start of a ""different"" version of me. like i forget or get into a ""that not me"" ""i cant"" ""i dont do that"" ""i dont like that"" loop on things i know i do enjoy and can do? i know its just a mental block but even when i try to work through it, its so mentally exhausting i end up quitting short after. similarly i am a creative who graduated from art school a few years ago and yet my brain doubts and avoids the things i know at one point i was perfectly capable of doing (and enjoying). i was chalking it up to good old depression and potential memory issues but seeing as someone else with bpd experiencing this is interesting. i really want to find the root of this phenomenon, if others experience it, how other people tackle it, and what is really triggering it. thank you for letting me know im not alone lmao"

axolotls,fmfyfhq,t3_fu0wta,1586037464.0,is the water cold enough? ive has that same thing happen once to my girl and it was because the water had gotten too warm without me noticing.
axolotls,fmfy3o0,t3_fucdcv,1586037267.0,the bigger one will be more aggressive. axolotls will generally attempt to eat ANYTHING that fits in their mouth and is smaller than them
axolotls,fmfxgsx,t1_fmfbndr,1586036888.0,water changes and more frequent cleanings will help reduce ammonia fast. also consider adding some plants
axolotls,fmfx7hm,t1_fmfjwh2,1586036732.0,"hello!! i also own axolotls and things i tell people who want them as pets additionally to  what was said above, to get VERY comfortable with handling worms. i know that makes a lot of people squeamish. earth worms, also known as night crawlers, are the best thing to feed them. they can sense the vibrations in the water as the worm wiggles and i found that they really enjoy eating when theyre moving (i know people also feed em blood worms too but my guys refuse to eat them) but theyre also a little stupid so sometimes you gotta make sure that they found and ate the worms and didnt leave any bits behind, as its a super fast and easy way to ruin water quality if it rots in the tank. 

they also love their tanks COLD (below 72 degrees) so make sure you have a system for this.  usually, keeping a fan running right above the water help keep the tank cool enough. keeping a partially open top to allow water to evaporate really helps, and always keep tabs on their tank temperature, especially during the summer and winter (heaters can make the temp rise real high real fast which is not good for them).

&#x200B;

i use an aquaclear filter because it allows you to control and lower the flow which they like

good luck with your axolotls!!"

My therapist said  something about ""quiet bpd""
That rather than exploding with emotions outwardly, implode with emotions in silence to myself, sometimes to the point of numbness. 

Hopefully that helps?"
BPD,ffhh8sb,t1_ffh5ztr,1579935142.0,"Yes!! Sometimes I'll go through the motions of ""who am i"" and ""who have I been this whole time"" as if each day I'm realizing somethings off"
BPD,ffhgx8u,t1_ffh5sx0,1579934746.0,"Haha what sucks is that I'm so paranoid, that I feel like I edge them on into thinking that I have bpd, rather than having them come to the conclusion based on who I really am. Like I subconsciously did this to myself and I'm not actually bpd. So when everyone says ""possibly,"" if feels like I truly am some horrible liar trying to play victim or some other weird bullshit idiot undermining what people who actually have bpd go through.

But isnt this train of thought, really in the end, the answer confirming that I have bpd? Because I'll run through these insane lengths to play to my paranoia??

But thank you. Hearing that you also had this unfortunate experience let's me know I'm not loosing my mind lmao"
