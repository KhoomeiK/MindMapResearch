I believe 9H (extremely hard, will likely scratch most papers, leaves light gray marks) is the hardest scaling to H, then HB (mix of hard and soft, closest to #2 pencils used in testing), 2B (the most common hardness used in drawing) then scaling up to 9B (being very soft and makes very dark marks)."

I've only been drawing a few years, nowhere near your level. This is some real talent.  Keep up the great work!"

aspergers,fqt4z4v,t3_gkj2cr,1589630135.0,"I love to dance.  When I was younger I would go to raves and watch people dance, pretty much hiding away.  What I realized through hours of observation is that MOST people do not KNOW how to dance. Basically there are many different disciplines of dance, and unless you are choosing a specific discipline, all you have to KNOW is that you are moving to the music.  I found a way to get so hyper focused on the math of the beat and how I can express that in my movement, I am able to block out other people.  Once you realize no one knows what they are doing, and no one cares how you dance, it can be very freeing. I've been told I'm a good dancer, I don't think I am, but I do enjoy it. Don't get me wrong, it was not easy to find that focus.  But it was like anything else I've done, watched a million videos, studied some theory, etc. etc. I also don't really dance *with* other people, so maybe that is easier for me.

magick,fot9s2c,t3_g8w16x,1588048021.0,"Who am I? I AM.  This meditation is why I am here.  I've had some very extreme experiences during meditation where I have left my body and experienced things that words can not fully describe.  I experienced a god like form that simply said ""I AM"" and then showed me all of time and existence being created and destroyed. I am trying to find a system that will help me to understand how I got there, so I can go back.  Jiddu Krishnamurti was my original inspiration.  I've been looking into A.'.A.'., O.T.O, O.'.A.'., GD, RC, Masons, etc.  Also have been contacted by ""the brotherhood of Light"".  A portal opened one day as I was vacuuming, weird I know, and there were 12 beings made completely of blue, yellow and white light sitting around a table, the one at the front of the table was standing and spoke ""we are the brotherhood of light, and we are here to help.  I've never had anything like that ever happen again.  But the memory sticks with me and I want to find out why it happened, and if there is a way to contact them again.  Or if there is a teacher on earth that can understand what I am talking about and help me to understand.  I'm not sure if this is the right sub, or this has anything to with thelema, but I wanted to just say yes to your post and reach out.  Thanks for posting, thanks for reading."

I feel like the good qualities of AS don't really matter in my life because all of the negativity takes precedence.  Positive self talk is a skill that I need to learn.  


I am doing as much research as I can about AS, although it can be quite confusing at times.  Apparently the DSM doesn't separate AS from autism, and the two seem extremely different.  The high functioning aspect of AS makes me feel like this is a separate condition that autism.  They are not variations of the same thing.  An autistic child will not grow up to become someone with AS and vice versa.  I find it difficult to synthesize the information because I feel like there is a deep flaw in the basic understanding of what AS is or how to define it."

SSRI's and generalized anxiety meds like buspar end up making me for more foggy and disconnected, resulting in a deeper depression. 3 of my 4 attempts were wile on medications for depression.  I've felt depressed for as far back as I can remember(maybe 2 or 3 years old), nothing has helped."

Once confirmed help me find the resources I need to live a life that doesn't feel like I'm drowning.  I received a pm from another redditor suggesting a social worker, this may be the route I will go.  


  
Edit:  Yes, that is exactly what is happening... It feels like the negativity just bleeds into every aspect of my life, and I become less and less the person I want to be."
