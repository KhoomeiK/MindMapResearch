Doom,fng1zp1,t3_fmuuz3,1586920456.0,This game is a huge disappointment for me after playing 2016. The graphics and artwork are somehow worse. It's too arcade-like now. I hate how everything you pick up is a hologram. I liked 2016 where you actually picked things up. The ridiculous yells when you get shot. I get they went with the classic look but I preferred the more serious and more realistic feel of the 2016 version. It pisses me off Doomslayer is strong as fuck but you hardly hurt possessed when you melee them. They did way too much with this game. Hope I change my mind the more I play.
depression,f8c4fe8,t3_dzrccf,1574452199.0,Me right now. I was depressed in a 3 year long relationship but even more so now. It's the worst feeling. And then when I'm interested in a girl I text way too much and look creepy.
depression,f77jju6,t1_f77ix66,1573459836.0,"It isn't that great having a job. Sure its nice having money and things, but sometimes time is more important. I feel like life passes me by since I look forward to my next day off. This is what life is about; working a job every day for the rest of your life and never really enjoying the fruits of your labor until you're too old to enjoy them. I apologize for running on and on. I hope that wrist heals quickly. Can't wait until the day it's completely legal so I can join in on the fun! Drinking is overrated."
depression,f77ithp,t3_duovd3,1573458770.0,I WISH I could smoke. My job does random tests though so I fucking can't. I need it - I'm fucking miserable. At least with that I could get away for a bit. It's been years since I've done it but I can't get the feeling it gives me out of my head.
depression,f77i6p5,t3_dujk4r,1573457882.0,I truly feel what you're saying. I wish the world would just end.
depression,f77i3nr,t3_dujc20,1573457765.0,This is all I do living with my parents at the age of 28. Cant even get a girl let alone friend. I wake up to no more messages from people or notifications like I did when I was younger. I'm just a nobody who is given everything to stay alive but lives for nothing. I have no hope and never did. I'm just going to be forgotten the moment I die and I know it's all my fault. I'm sorry I'm of no help. I just need to get it out. I need out.
depression,f4u5pfv,t1_f4t1o1o,1571799815.0,"Yeah I'm 28 and still living at home because I have no clue what to do with my life. I never envisioned this for myself, but I also never thought I'd live this long. I wish someone could take control of me because I want none of it. It's always nice to relate though. I'm sure things will look up eventually for all of us. Here's to hoping, anyway."
depression,f4sep7j,t3_dlfw2v,1571777021.0,Yes. All I do is work every day with no plans for my future. Girlfriend left me after three years and can't find anyone. All I do is go to the gym and play video games. Basically feel like I'm on life support - never really enjoying anything. Always thinking about the better times. I feel like someday I'm going to end up homeless because I have no goals. Just feel worthless. You're not alone.
depression,f3dxnij,t1_f3d2f86,1570850154.0,And it just gets worse as you get older and lose loved ones and friends :(
depression,f2od2gd,t3_ddtdzc,1570326323.0,I feel it. I miss not worrying about finding a life partner or not knowing my future. I miss simplicity. I'm learning to embrace death because that's the only way I'll have it.
depression,f1y6ezn,t3_db2v5y,1569810338.0,I'm 28 and single and have done nothing with my life. I wish I could help and say something comforting but I can only relate. I wish we didn't have to live a life like this. This social anxiety is killing me. I just want someone to talk to. Actually talk and not just text or social media. These days really suck. Everyone is too busy for you and only talks to you through social media
depression,f1y5fvk,t3_darfyw,1569809763.0,Sometimes I wonder this also. I'm always in so much emotional pain. It feels like purgatory or hell
depression,f1y5aln,t3_db2gev,1569809684.0,"I feel like a lot of times ""love"" is just a waste of time. Especially being with someone for years only for them to never talk to you again in an instant - you lose that belief. It's not easy being a 28 y/o male who has done nothing with his life but work. I don't believe in the whole saying ""you have to love yourself before loving someone else"". If no one loves you, that gets very difficult to do."
depression,f1y3m1f,t3_db2577,1569808767.0,"Yes. That's how I feel. I'm 28 have done nothing with my life and girlfriend of 3 years left me. Now all I have is my parents and I can't tell them how I feel. Now I eat tons of junk food hoping I'll get a heart attack and drop dead. I grew up believing life would be like the movies and go according to plan. What a joke it all is. I'm sorry for venting, it's just nice to have something in relation with someone."
depression,f1xwenq,t3_dax3h7,1569805054.0,"This feels like me right now. I've been with a girl for over 3 years and she decided to leave me for some guy at her work. Isnt it funny how people stay with you all that time only for it to end in the blink of an eye? All those promises for nothing. No wonder so many people die alone. I agree finding someone else is next to impossible given that you spent so much time with her. Now I haven't talked to her in months and nothing. It's the worst feeling in the world being forgotten about-- everything you had. All the memories gone in an instant. I wish people didnt always want new things, but so many girls think that way. So many take the feeling of it being new as them thinking they have more in common. It's the worst feeling ever."
depression,f1lfaxg,t3_d9mo8r,1569553257.0,My life
depression,f1lf9tn,t3_d9lwwa,1569553235.0,I wish I was never born. Then I wouldn't have to deal with heartbreak or loss of any kind. I just feel so worthless and nobody cares like in the movies. What's the point? Fuck it all.
depression,f1d9e5j,t3_d8oilm,1569377361.0,I feel you. Now that my girlfriend left me I feel like I'm good for nothing. I was depressed when I was in a relationship because I hardly saw her the three years we were together. Now she doesnt talk to me and seemingly every girl ignores me. I feel cursed like people just don't like me in general. I feel like I'm just desperate to meet someone who cares about me. I wish i had a friend like you who knew how this feels. I hope things get better for you.
depression,f1a26q6,t3_d86ioa,1569283570.0,I'm the same way. I feel like the only way I'll be happy and feel that is if I have a relationship. I miss not needing all that as a kid -just enjoying all those little things without those worries. I'm too afraid of changes and that's why I still live at home. Makes me wonder if I'll ever feel that again or if there is a next life where I would.
depression,f0ksnuk,t1_f0jzmj2,1568687065.0,Thanks. Made me feel better.
depression,f0kslre,t1_f0kary2,1568687024.0,This is why I didn't go to college. I gave up before I even graduated high school. I had to cheat to graduate. I never planned on being around this long. So here I am still with my parents.
depression,f0ju25f,t1_f0j4qfx,1568663044.0,Can I join you...
depression,f0jtxz9,t1_f0isi8v,1568662969.0,This is how I lost my girlfriend. She valued work and money more than time with me. Found some guy at her work. All about convenience these days.
depression,f0jts0e,t1_f0jp914,1568662856.0,It's sad how a lot of us as kids thought life would be great as adults only to turn out like this -- all our hopes let down and unable to truly enjoy anything without worry.
depression,ezv0j4n,t1_ezupmxt,1568164400.0,I do too. I get anxiety real bad especially when people are watching me as I talk. Wish I was one of the people who could just walk up to someone. I'm thinking about maybe seeing a therapist. Society doesnt make it any easier.
depression,ezt9jz2,t1_ezsx90s,1568124944.0,"That doesn't make your worth any less than mine. I just can't stand not working. This at least keeps my mind off my depression and lack of social/love life and allows me to talk to people without me having to really go out of my way (I'm forced). Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking to anyone and that's something most people can't live without."
depression,ezsldut,t1_ezsknba,1568096302.0,I work at a tire shop. Pay is decent as is benefits. Keeps me busy.
depression,ezqnfd8,t1_ezqn310,1568061584.0,Damn that must be terrible. At least you did it unlike me. I'm the same when it comes to weight lifting. Squats are making my knees pop. Getting older just sucks.
depression,ezqn4fh,t1_ezpvb97,1568061473.0,28 and same for me. Still live with my parents. My dad constantly reminds me I should/should have joined the military. I used to go to the gym all the time but now hardly anymore because I'm so damn tired. Single. Just feel like living in video games anymore. I just feel so useless and now my looks are deteriorating as I get older. Is this really what life is about...
depression,ezqmmmn,t1_ezq90b3,1568061286.0,What was it that you did that you can't anymore -if you don't mind my asking?
depression,ezo4lnr,t1_ezo4bqj,1568016465.0,Yes. Hardly anyone on it and when I find someone to talk to they ignore me. Each time adds to the pain but I keep trying. As is life. Pof and tinder are full of fake profiles.
depression,ezo49k1,t3_d1fhkj,1568016304.0,You're not alone. The world is a hurtful place full of expectations and people no better. I hope we find happiness and soon...
depression,ezo3ay5,t1_ezo2vbj,1568015854.0,"Unfortunately for me,it's a military town and so I only know of bars. Really doubt that would make me any happier in the long run anyway. I just got to better myself but I don't know how. Thank you."
depression,ez2w35a,t3_czrhkf,1567659036.0,I never got real into it but I did it when I was a teenager. People always ask me how I got the scars...and it's embarrassing.  I tell them a cat did it and they usually buy it..I think.
depression,ez2v4lh,t3_czt00k,1567658761.0,Yes. I'm honestly afraid that I will do it. I'm also afraid that if I do I'll go to a worse place. I blame the way I was raised.
depression,eyy1w7v,t3_czadw0,1567568731.0,I've always hoped life would be like the movies. It's the most depressing thing finally realizing that it's not - that you're not really special and how easily we are forgotten as we get older...
depression,eyqs3ko,t3_cxzfzt,1567352124.0,This made me so happy reading this. You are so contagious! Thank you for making my day! It's so nice to see someone be so positive and try to get out there. You're doing great! Keep it up. 😁
depression,eyptfdf,t1_eypgm21,1567310687.0,You're so right. I hate responsibility and if I were to live on my own I wouldn't be able to afford anything. Theres no point. I just hate the fact everyone looks down on us for living with parents. I hate that it destroys confidence and self esteem and we can blame society for that.
depression,eypswk1,t3_cy0nam,1567310180.0,Wow ..are you me?? I live with my parents at 28 and feel the same way. Never been to college and work a overtime job. I feel my body aching more and more.  It's always been hard to find a girl  and i worry if i don't do something now I'll have a miserable life. I'm there with you. I wish i had words of encouragement but I've nearly lost all hope. I don't mean to go on about me but you just remind me of myself a lot. I really hope we find a way to overcome all this and find a way to happiness but this life makes everything so complicated and every choice is never black and white. I just wish everything was easier and more like the movies
depression,eydyrkf,t3_cwnhka,1567026490.0,Yes. I actually enjoy work because it takes my mind off of my own thoughts. Makes me feel part of something. I work a customer service job which allows me to be more social because when I'm not at work I never talk to people other than my parents. I hate thinking about going to work but when I'm there I don't mind. You're not alone.
depression,ey7gt7m,t1_ey7g2ca,1566882709.0,I'm glad that you can express yourself. No matter with who it always makes me (or anyone) feel better. It's nice to see such a positive attitude and that you're trying. I'm sure you've experienced much more of life than me. I've been here my entire life. I haven't even tried to go out on my own. The way society is makes me feel pretty ashamed to even mention it. My dad tried so hard to get me to join the military so I feel like a disappointment to him as well. It just sucks not knowing what you want to do. If I had a choice I wouldn't do anything. I literally have no interests. Its nice someone can listen. I hope everything works out for you and that you beat that addiction.
depression,ey7ehny,t1_ey7d8s7,1566880235.0,Good to know I'm not the only one my age still at home. I'm afraid of responsibility which is one of the reasons I'm still here. That and saving money is nice.  I also get along with my parents. I just figure what's the point in moving out if I have no clue what I want to do or where I want to go? Would you mind sharing your reasons? Just nice to relate.
depression,ey764gk,t3_cvv7n0,1566872871.0,I wish I was never born. I wouldn't have been able to make all the horrible decisions I made. I wouldn't still be with my parents at 28. What's the point of it all...
depression,ey75wm3,t3_cvssty,1566872700.0,Nice to see how many kind people there are here. Wish everyone was this open in real life and unafraid to talk. Oh and *hug*
depression,ey75mhx,t1_ey6gbd9,1566872479.0,I feel you. 28 and live with my parents. Girlfriend of 3 years left me. I feel like I have nothing to live for but work every day. Life just gets worse and worse every day with the inevitability of responsibility bearing down. Can't handle this shit. Wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.
depression,ey1rys5,t3_cuzdat,1566708991.0,"After being with someone for 3 years I cant even think about doing the process all over. At 28 I think I'll just stay single the rest of my life. It isnt worth the effort...even if someone seems like they love you - even for years -it could all be a lie. They'll just find someone newer and ""better""."
depression,exwfdzk,t1_exw7e87,1566618636.0,That doesnt last very long
depression,exjthfp,t3_ct08qp,1566359951.0,I feel like we are all cattle. Prisoners of our instinctual drive to exist. Told what to do every day. When you can finally retire you'll be too old to actually enjoy what you've worked for.
depression,exdr6ub,t1_exdqe5t,1566184309.0,That sounds like a great idea! Just gotta find the right people. That's difficult of itself. Hey thanks for the advice. Nice to see some good people on here.
depression,exdfkpz,t1_exd7lmg,1566175321.0,Im sorry to hear about your parents. Mine arent the greatest either but they've done so much for me. No. I have a hard time meeting girls because of how socially awkward and shy I am. Also very low self-esteem and confidence. I would like to start a new relationship but it just feels like a waste of time and emotion. I can never keep girls I meet attention because I just don't feel like going through that stage of getting to know them. Its monotonous and usually doesn't end well. I've just lost faith after that long of a relationship. Funny thing is her name was Faith. Just thinking about starting the cycle over again is deterring. Girls wonder why men just want sex...
depression,exd4pet,t1_exd49mq,1566167173.0,"I understand how you feel. I was with a girl for 3 years and eventually the newness wore off and could tell her interest in me was fading. Didnt help living 50 miles away. It sucks that even when someone tells you they love you, no matter how many times, that feeling can always disappear. That's why family is so important to place value on."
depression,ex84xp1,t1_ex7dlsf,1566068806.0,Thank you. Nice to know I'm not alone.
depression,ex24j0z,t1_ex238ro,1565962591.0,I do work out. Just haven't lately. Could be the reason I feel so down. Thanks.
depression,ex1bak2,t3_cml6ni,1565937769.0,"So I'm here because I have no one else to talk to. I'm 28 still living at home with my parents. I still don't know what I want with my life. I'm just not interested in anything and I'm afraid I'll never know who I am. I get suicidal thoughts all the time but I'm too scared to act on them. I was in a relationship for three years and she just left me like it was nothing. She was all I had every day for those 3 years and i was so happy. Now I realize how much I miss that companionship. It's funny how we all take everyone for granted until they're gone - all the good times and even the bad. All those little moments that we only truly appreciate once they're in the past. I'm just scared and sad. I'm too awkward to even have guy friends. I've always been shy my whole life. Never made friends throughout school so I have no one to fall back on. It's scary how once you get caught up in the daily grind of work, the quality of life goes way down and time passes before your very eyes. The way I see everything is grim. I just want to get everything out because I don't know what to do anymore. I'm afraid of myself; all the thoughts I'm left with. I just want to be respected and for people to like me. That's all I ever wanted and now it seems so impossible with the way I am. I know my writing is a mess but thank you for taking your time to read if you do. Sometimes I just want to be heard like the rest of us."
