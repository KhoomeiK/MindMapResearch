asktransgender,fqsgno8,t3_gkovfb,1589606758.0,"Well I'm sort of in a similar position as you. I'm 16, pre everything and only out to my mother. Both my parents accept LGBT+ people but i don't think they understand them very well. 
When i came out to my mother the first thing she asked was if didn't just liked boys and was gay so i had to explain that that wasn't the case and that i wanted to be a woman and that i was lesbian. My mother really didn't rapid fire questions and gave a clear opinion about it because 'what if its all just a phase? Later she asked more questions but they were very basic like; what about your hair?, when will you tell your dad and brother? What if people start bullying you? She was just very concerned about me and in my experience my mother (and probably my father too) will be very careful asking questions because they don't want to be rude to you in any way. They can and probably will slip up sometimes with pronounces and stuff like that. 
In conclusion, they don't really ask difficult questions and if you don't know an answer right away they let you take your time because at the end of the day they care for you."

When i was young i didn't play with dolls or anything like that but when i was 16 i had depression and found out that i felt so sad because i didn't want to be a boy. Also i don't feel like i had much of a personality before the depression, i just went with flow and acted like an average boy.

Idk if this helped in anyway but that my experience💞"
