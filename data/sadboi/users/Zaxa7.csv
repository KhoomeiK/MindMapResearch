AskFeminists,fhkr29x,t3_f3qguc,1581689661.0,"I think it goes both ways, we talk mainly about Asian fever (I also mean south as well as east Asian) but rarely about white fever as white is often seen as the default race in the west anyway.
In my extended social circle Asian and black women often note how they're fetishized in the dating world. Recent example, black friend went on a date with white man and the date went great till he said 'ive always wondered what it's like to be with a black girl'. Now this could be seen as innocent curiosity or downright fetishization as it implies black women were so inherently different to white women that being with one would be an experience.
I (brown male) recently matched with a white woman on a dating app and conversation was great till she said she wants to mix her vanilla ice cream with my chocolate brownie. Direct quote. Wtf. Unmatched and blocked immediately.
I understand that minorities may seem exotic to those who have lived and grown up in predominantly white areas then moved to a cosmopolitan city but it reeks of racism to me on some level because we are defined by the color of our skin and perhaps pop culture perception of our race rather than our innate value as a person.
Conversely a number of Asian women I know exclusively date white men because they believe Asian men are inherently backwards and patriarchal. While that generalisation is unfair, it has a basis in what they see within their own community and they often feel they won't be as 'free' with an asian man as they would with a white man."

socialskills,ff8t4bc,t3_es7zst,1579695085.0,"In my experience, confidence can really 'make up for' seemingly average looks. Ever notice how lots of conventionally attractive people don't seem to have much of a personality because they often get by on their looks, are automatically liked and trusted. Someone not conventionally attractive has to work on their personality. There is someone for everyone. If you make yourself an interesting person by engaging in hobbies, being healthy, socialising, people will naturally gravitate towards you, rightly so. Because looks may attract people but a personality is what makes a partner stay with you.
Granted lots of people are shallow but by the same token many more value a personality than a pretty face."

So I went on a weight gain program, researched it myself and spent 6 months training, eating, finding hobbies, writing. Forcing myself into social situations until I had to get used to talking to people.
A few responded in kind, became my friends. I moves away from that place n lost them but continued my activities to keep my mind occupied n to keep being around people, made new friends. Some are reliable. But I count on myself the most.

When you speak again, perhaps try not to only talk of emotions. Talk about your hobbies, last film you saw, game you played, a sport you've always wanted to try, speak of more positive memories n share those too.
That'll be a much healthier relationship for both and will bring you closer together.
I'm unsure if you meant that you used to speak via voice but not anymore. If that's the case, give time still. Otherwise also be mindful in case they're not who they say they are.

Trial and error mate. 

I started out light then if we ever hung out alone or had a moment away from group of friends, I'd frankly talk about my mental health and see what the response is.

 Another tactic, if they're straight, I'll ask what they think of a particular woman in our crew and if they respond about tits or ass, they're out. If they say yea she seems interesting and her job is so cool then they pass muster. Obviously not line for line here.

Basically I reckon you get a feel for it by actually trying to have a deeper conversation."

Ask him to take some time and consider what is suddenly making him feel insecure. Remind him he has female friends (i assume) too that you're not jealous about and that you're both allowed to give an opinion but you can't force each other to stop talking to someone.

I think whatever happens, he needs to examine why he is feeling insecure, there could be more to this that he is just projecting on you.

MensLib,f3006ni,t3_deudg4,1570543290.0,"As sad as I am to read about all your experiences, im also glad not to be alone in this. I'm a man and this type of stuff has happened to me a handful of times over a decade but each time puts a damper on things for months on end. Sorry this is gonna be long.

1. Went on a 1st date in my early 20s, Prior to the date, we spoke for 3 hours on phone and got on really well. On the date she had her hand on my upper leg, near the crotch at all times, I thought it was accidental coz no one would do that on purpose. She kissed me while we were talking, twas a surprise but I enjoyed it. Then she felt up my arms then chest so I pulled back from the kiss and kept chatting.
She kept kissing me while I was literally open mouthed saying words. At one point I said hey don't you want us to get to know each other? She said we talked enough on phone. Are you gay or something? You're so weird. Guys can't say no, women say no.

I was embarrassed, blamed myself, thought maybe I was boring that's why she kissed me to stop conversation.

2. I've had this female friend for 3 years, she is very possessive of her male friends and gets jealous when they get female interest. She had tickled me and held my arm while walking and caressed my stomach multiple times in public within our social group, I was uncomfortable with all of it but she's so nice n friendly so I thought it would hurt her if I stopped it.
One evening we were all out at a dance, I met this girl who I liked and she joined us all for a drink after the dance. She was sitting between me and the female friend. Female friend realised I like the girl, leaned over and said to her 'he's my bestie' and then stroked my chin...WTF

This is all probs sounding minor but if continuous over multiple years, it pisses you off to have boundaries stepped over like that. Like you owe them access to your body.

It took multiple chats over multiple months for her to finally stop and ultimately damaged the friendship beyond repair because to her the touching was a normal part of friendship and apparently she did so with female friends too.

I felt sad at losing a friend but free at last.

3. I was hanging out with 2 female friends daytime, saw the Lion King then sat somewhere to talk about it. Friend A had recently become a close friend, sharing personal stories of trauma. So A, B and I were chatting then A decided it would be funny to pull open my shirt buttons (Its the click type buttons) she opened the top. I was in shock and I laughed nervously coz I didn't know what to do with myself.

I then put my hands up to cover my chest. She then pulled the bottom part of my shirt open and I was fully exposed while both A and B laughed. (B later apologised as she didn't realise I was uncomfortable üôÑ)

Friend A knew about the issues with the person I mentioned in my second story above and still thought ok to do this. Friend A is no longer a friend, she removed herself after saying I took a joke too seriously and hurt her feelings by confronting her so strongly.

Now I know these weren't all advances but they were over stepping my boundaries and autonomy. In all 3 situations I could have physically stopped the assault but I know it would like I was the aggressor if I did so. No one would believe a guy.

When I tried to discuss with male or female friends, they mostly dismissed or laughed or told me I'm a player and should feel lucky women are taking my shirt off. Some friends backed me up though and told me it was ok to ask for respect and not my fault.

I guess my conclusion is, as a man, you can't always physically stop an assault due to societal views, however you can 

1.remove yourself from situations by leaving 
2. having a trusted friend with a secret signal come over n diffuse
3. Talk to the person on a separate occasion and explain why you felt violated, in a diplomatic way.
4. Talk to a trusted friend afterwards to get your feelings of self doubt and shame out.
5. Talk to us here on Reddit.

Remember, just because we are men doesn't mean we have to say yes to any and all advances, we are entitled to our bodily autonomy too, we have to give consent too, not just ask for it. We must respect ourselves as well as others.

Sorry this went so long and i kinda lost the plot. I had more stories that were explicit where gfs 'forced' themselves on me. But I think the above is enough for now.

Thank you."
