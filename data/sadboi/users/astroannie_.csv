She always hid under the blanket so the creature wouldn't see her. In her sleep paralysis she usually saw a really skinny shadow creature slid down from the ceiling and disappeared back into the wall after lurking around her bed for a while.

How close are you and the friend that invited you? When I looked back on the times I suffered most from feeling like a third wheel, I noticed that it was because I didn't have as much in common with the person that brought me along as well as with the people at the party.
Do you usually enjoy being social or could it be that parties might not be your thing? If so, that's totally okay and nothing to feel bad about!"

My parents are the same - pretty old fashioned in regards to mental health problems and kind of like ""Oh, it can't be that bad"". I don't know where you live, but maybe you can talk to your doctor about the situation? They might be able to get you an appointment with a professional to help you deal with everything. That's the approach I took when I first told my parents. Talked to the doctor, he told me his thoughts on that and helped me get in touch with a therapist. Only after that was all done have I told my parents. I sat down with them (and believe me, it sucks, but it's also good to atleast let them know, if your situation allows it) and told them that I've been speaking to my doctor and that he advised me to get therapy. I also told them that I don't expect them to fully understand what I'm going through, but to atleast support me on that journey.
If you need someone to talk to, my DMs are open."
mentalhealth,f94wvuu,t3_e3tr59,1575107842.0,"Hi! I think that it's a really good start that you can acknowledge those feelings. It sounds like you've been surrounding yourself with a lot of toxic people - you don't have to blame yourself for that. It might be helpful to talk to a therapist about how you are feeling. Working those things through with a professional might help you getting closure on them and how to deal with the situation. Maybe group therapy would be a thing for you? That would also be a great way to meet other people that understand how difficult mental health problems can be.
But most importantly: Please don't put too much pressure on yourself. It takes time to heal. If you need to talk to someone, my DMs are open."
mentalhealth,f94wnll,t3_e3ss7y,1575107481.0,"First of all: I think that it's great that you have already talked to him about how you are feeling and what you are going through. I don't think that it's ""too much"" to ask for support from your partner. It can be difficult to distinguish between ""getting supported by them"" and ""relying on that person to cope"". As long as you discuss boundaries with him (what's okay, what might be too much) I think it's totally fine to ask him. All in all you are trying to work through something that weighs heavily on you and no one should have to go through tough times alone. Maybe you could also talk to a friend, if you need someone to talk to and your partner doesn't have the capacity at the moment. There are also really great 24/7 hotlines you can call if you just want to talk to somebody until you feel calmer.
Good luck and all the best on your way!"

Also, have you already talked to a therapist? That might help you.

Feel free to DM me if you need someone to talk to! :)"
mentalhealth,f85hzqx,t3_dz3ias,1574275660.0,"First of all: It's really great that you've decided to seek help! That's a good first step. Please stay in touch with your doctor and regularly talk to them to see if your anxiety and depression eases. (Just a thing from personal experience with meds: Sometimes it gets worse before it gets better. But don't let that stop you! Talk to your doctor about what's going on.)

Just like another person suggested, maybe try therapy. For some people it is really helpful.

I get that it is really disheartening when your partner reacts this way. But ultimately you're doing this for yourself, so you'll feel better. Maybe sit down with them and have a serious talk. It's a really difficult subject, but maybe your partner just struggles with coming to terms with the situation? Mental illnesses are sadly still very stigmatized."
mentalhealth,f85hhqe,t3_dz56bj,1574275355.0,"I really struggled to come to terms with my mental health problems, just like you've described. I'm also really good at hiding when something is ""wrong"". What helped me ease into the whole therapy thing was to get a counselor that I wouldn't meet in person. In Germany, the health insurances typically offer programs designed like that. You'd talk to your therapist on the phone and online on a weekly basis, but you would never see them in person. After I'd done that for a year, I decided to seek out ""normal"" therapy, where I go to a therapist once a week and talk to him. As far as I know, online counseling is also available in the US. Depending on where you live, that could be something you might like to try?"
