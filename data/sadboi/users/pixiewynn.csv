I cried in session today. My kiddo was doing an independent activity so I excused myself to the restroom. It’s hard for me to keep it together right now when I see my kiddos family all together and I go home to my empty apartment and can’t visit my parents, for I dont know how long, because I don’t want to risk infecting my parents who are in high risk categories while Im still out risking infection myself. 😞"
ABA,fl1kgp2,t1_fl1jfh6,1584730776.0,"My dillema also stems from the fact that, as a child, I had severe asthma which would make it difficult for me or slow for me to heal if compromised. On top of that both parents work at a hospital AND elderly grandparents live in the home. I wish our agencies would asses the at home situations and  status of progress for each kiddo and HELP us make ethical decisions. Sending you love during this difficult confusing time. ❤️"
ABA,fl1gixa,t3_flq35c,1584728548.0,"I feel that. My agency is even pushing MORE hours to compensate for the cases where RBTs have chosen to not continue work at this time but parents still want to continue services (we are an in home service agency). Agency just rolled out tele health for the BCBAs but us RBTs are SOL. Still the front line soldiers. We do have the option to not go in, but then no pay.  :/ its a difficult decision and I’m scared."
