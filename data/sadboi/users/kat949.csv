meToo,evewcxc,t3_ciq4z8,1564481259.0,"you're absolutely entitled to your feelings for being put in that incredibly uncomfortable situation and being manipulated into feeling shame or embarrassment. this person sounds like they aren't fully aware of the major violations of trust and boundaries you have, nor does it seem like they tried to talk to you about how these situations made you feel. while it may have been ages ago, this doesn't undo the pain you went through. i hope you find people who consider your emotions and try to communicate with you better in the future. it sounds like you're already taking steps to growing from this experience and perhaps you can find someone you can trust to open up to and get closure/insight. therapists are nice because unlike family they don't have preconceived ideas of you, but over time i hope you feel safe enough to tell friends or family to give you that back board and support. it takes time, but i hope you can remember that this isn't your fault. mourning the person you used to be and the actions (or lack there of) of a past self only brings about more pain. you now have a perspective that allows you be thoughtful of the impact of your actions and the actions of others, and i hope you find courage in sharing this so others can be more thoughtful as well."
meToo,eveux8z,t3_cjk3h9,1564479842.0,"i was on the other side of a similar situation, and the fact she forgives you is major. please don't overlook this. awareness really is the first step towards growth, and even cacti grow in the desert where it should be impossible for anything the live. harboring hatred towards yourself won't undo what's been done nor will it help others understand the shame you feel about past mistakes. all anyone can really do is try to take away lessons from these painful situations to better understand yourself and others who might sympathize. you hadn't intended to hurt her, and it sounds like you've become more thoughtful about how your actions may impact others. it can be uncomfortable and even traumatizing recounting your experiences, but try to take these shitty feelings and use them as fertilizer to nourish yourself and the ones around you to cultivate the conversations and actions in your environment. this perspective has given you the opportunity to provoke safe spaces, but i understand how easy it is to mourn the person you used to be. it might not make sense now, but just take it one day at a time and each day will provide new insights and perhaps therapy (as intimidating as it can be) can shed some light on the possibilities for the life you can create. it's cheesy, but time really does heal."
LongDistance,ev0pnx6,t3_ci1o9a,1564144021.0,"I relate a lot to your girlfriend in the sense that I'm living with mental health issues. My partner (20M)  and I (20F) have had a very intimate relationship, both physically and emotionally, so the physical distance makes me fee emotionally detached at times. I know that when I'm feeling isolated, I let myself deny the forms of happiness and comfort that can kind of palate those feelings of emptiness or loneliness. When I try to push my partner away, what I really want it to be closer to him, but I feel guilty for wanting this when I have a lot weighing me down. What helps me come down from that dark place is just remembering that I DO have that support system. Knowing that I have a safe space to just unload or to coexist with someone who accepts me as I am is something that keeps me grounded. Looking forward to seeing them again, taking it one day at a time, and finding an outlet (music, knitting, exercise, etc.) outside of work and other responsibilities to just kind of try and remind myself what it's like to be alive have all helped me get through the rough times. I don't know if any of this will help y'all's situation but I understand the struggle and genuinely hope that y'all find a dynamic that really works for both of you. It can feel like work sometimes, but some people are worth it."

Anxiety,et8vcef,t3_ca9reu,1562571984.0,"this is the exact reason i decided to go to university 500 miles away from my hometown. make sure you're going for other reasons as well, considering atmosphere, opportunity for growth, and your own safety at the very top.

when i got to college, i thought: finally, a group of people i can just be myself with. two years later, i'm only close to maybe four of those people.

as humans, our emotions are so fickle yet so valid, so it hurts when we feel unaccepted by the people we care about. rejection sucks.

but i'm coming to understand that people hold as much power as you give them. this isn't to dismiss past traumas, but to process them and focus on the lessons they taught you rather than the way they made you feel.

you are worth mask you wear, especially the one that feels most comfortable on you, you're true face. it's easy to feel uncomfortable with anxiety, almost to the point where we get used to it. but that discomfort doesn't have to be such a daunting norm.

the real ones will work for your love, they just need the opportunity which can only come with your permission. it's a real rough world, but hold your head high even when you feel like dying. just tell yourself everyday: tomorrow will be better. with guidance, work, resilience, self-love, and communication, lots of shitty days are worth those good ones üíï"

This age is a lot of figuring out and learning respect/boundaries in maintaining HEALTHY relationships. Everything might seem chaotic and isolating right now, but the only way to combat hate it with love (extra cheesy, my b). Really though, finding safe spaces and trustworthy people (friends, counselors, teachers, etc) where you can process this traumatic experience is super important so that you can move forward. Most importantly, remind yourself of your self worth daily, the truth will always fight to come out, and finding ways to cope (like exercise, journaling, whatever you do to feel like yourself) is vital in balancing the negative emotions with the positive ones. The hard experiences can either trap us or teach us, so I hope you find a support system to get you back on your feet and help you towards the bright future ahead. You deserve to be trusted, to be respected, and a shot at happiness."
