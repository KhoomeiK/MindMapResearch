Most degrees require electives, both inside and outside your major. I majored in English and took Computer Science classes as non-major electives. The goal of an elective (in theory) is to encourage critical thinking by encouraging you to think outside the box in relation to your primary field.

As an English major, though, I found that most folks are required to take first-year English. Classes offered beyond that focus on more advanced content or specific topics, especially courses aimed at third and fourth-year English students. My university usually numbered these as 300 and 400 level courses.

I'm almost done rambling lol. Basically, I'd encourage you to talk to the English department at your school about any courses in the catalog that you're interested in. If you like what you hear, go after the class! Just be warned that quite a lot of these have less advanced English courses as a prerequisite requirement."

The ""how to"" and what constitutes quality material is already provided by a ton of great posts in this community and elsewhere online.

The main reason I'm commenting is this: I found Jdramas to help my listening comprehension more than anime, even in my 101 class. I stumbled into Jdrama from a love of anime, specifically Sailor Moon; I discovered the live action iteration of the series, fell in love with the style of a couple of actresses in the series, and looked up other works the actresses were in. Mop Girl had a really cool premise (going back in time upon touching the belongings of the recently deceased). I even got a friend who has no interest in learning Japanese watching a subbed version of it.

In any case, the real-life pace of a Jdrama might be better for learning than the break-neck speed that anime characters speak. You also have the benefit of (usually) seeing the actor's mouth as he/she forms the words, which helped my pronunciation a bit.

I'm not trying to discourage you from anime, however! Watch what you'll enjoy, as you'll learn more and be more engaged with the material, but just something to consider. Just throwing out another option to explore Japanese media."

I had a tiefling barbarian launch a gnome wizard across a chasm... and she nat 1'd the athletics check. I stopped play, took a smoke break and consulted an experienced DM on what I could possibly do to keep this gnome with 4 hp from plunging to his death at the bottom of a 75' drop. He suggested an acrobatics check with a DC of 19 (wizard had pretty low dex) to catch the rope that had already been strung across the chasm by the *other* gnome, but warned me the wizard was probably going to die.

Wizard nat 20's.

Table. Went. Fucking. Insane.

I narrate how Nim, the 18"" tall gnome, was scooped up by this big, beefy barbarian, and he instantly realized something was off with her throw. He throws his hand out at the last possible second and snags the line that's secured between the platform he's being thrown from and the statue he's trying to get to. He pulls as hard as he can and launches himself upward, climbing onto the rope.

The other gnome (a monk) was slightly salty that his dex didn't get to shine, but, being a seasoned DM (and my husband lol), he also understood that this was literally the second session I had DM'd and that the wizard was a newer player. He ended up taking it in stride and using it as a teaching moment. ""You can't be afraid of player death!""

And that's the story of how I said ""screw it,"" and started letting my players win stupid prizes when they played stupid games. Maybe not the same as you, but definitely made me realize PC death is okay. Also, it gives me the chance to tell my favorite DM story, lol."

I've also started putting together a Dungeons and Dragons campaign to run. I've been playing D&D about a year now, and I've run a few single-session games, but I want to try running my own campaign. I had a little experience with CoC, Aces & Eights and Risus before D&D, but my husband moving in brought a slew of DM's materials with him. We've only added to that collection since.

My husband and I have also been spending a good bit of time in our music studio just jamming out. He's learning to play steel pan drum and bass ukulele. I'm learning Native American flute and improving my uke and bass guitar skills. I'm also teaching a friend standard six-string. My husband is a professional piano teacher.

We decided last night we were gonna start a podcast. My husband likes to get high (weed) and go off on massively entertaining tangents that end in light role-play (in a totally nonsexual context). I get stoned with him and end up DMing a mini game for one or two people. Dice are even involved sometimes. The other day, the rant was time travel and the game was basically ""you've been dropped off naked, Kyle Reese-style in the mountains of Nevada in 1840. What do you do with the knowledge you have from living in 2020?"" Our friend, a cop whose primary interests are guns and explosions, immediately started utilizing his boy scout training to secure basic needs and then plotting to use his knowledge of gunpowder and fireworks to find gold before the gold rush. My husband, meanwhile, ended up in 1510, just outside Florence, Italy. He was more concerned with finding Da Vinci than anything. This is a regular occurrence at our house, and folks have been telling us to start a YouTube channel or podcast for months.

I'm just a little leery of writing TMS fics just yet because I had at least two seasons of iCarly and a full season of Victorious down before I hopped into the fic scene with those shows. I'm not even halfway done with the only currently extant season of this new show, lol."
FanFiction,fgl769z,t1_fgl6tui,1580884368.0,"I watched Captain Planet the other day and felt the same way, lol. I saw every episode of the show as a kid and rewatched the first two seasons a few years ago. I've even written two or three short fics for the series. I watched an episode a few days ago and had the exact same reaction.

I only saw a couple of episodes of ChalkZone. My brother was really into it, but at that point, I was really getting into anime, so I just kind of disregarded it. It was a neat concept, though, so maybe I should revisit the series. How are you watching it?"

FanFiction,fg4sleg,t3_ewnlys,1580510194.0,"I'm a technical writer by training, so I tend to write shorter chapters. We're talking like, 1k-2k words in length. I actually prefer to read longer pieces with chapters clocking in between 4k-7k words in length.

I have an abandoned, unfinished fic that I've considered rewriting to really flesh out the chapters and push toward a longer chapter length and then turn around and finish. I actually had the final chapter written before I lost all my work and notes, and it was in that 7k range lol."

""Somehow, your hand has disconnected from your brain. ""This isn't right!"" it cries. You wonder if it is protesting your thoughts of her, or if it is really protesting the thoughts you're trying to force on yourself. You shut your eyes and try to focus on Adam again. The only image you can conjure, though, is a strong-willed Eve, touching you, kissing you, whispering in your ear, professing love for you. You're too fucked in the head to do this right now. But god damn if you aren't close."""

I've done this twice, and both pieces work well as a one-shot. I do have an abandoned fic that has over 20 chapters, though. Both my desktop and laptop crashed within days of each other and I lost the rest of the fic in the editing process. For almost 3 years, I haven't had the motivation to rewrite the end, and I absolutely LOVED what I had written. :( Doesn't help that I got divorced during the writing process. Really doesn't help that I'm now trying to plan a wedding while pregnant lol."
