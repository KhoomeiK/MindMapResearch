AskReddit,fgny329,t3_ezewgo,1580955424.0,"Cut off contact with my dad because he mentioned how much he hated my mom and wanted to see her dead in front of my kids. Didn't talk to him for over a year. Got a phone call from the hospital in July 2019 saying he had cancer and had only weeks to live. The doctor specifically told me it was time to makeup because this was my last chance. I did make up with my dad and was there for him in the end. He only lived 5 weeks after that phone call. I later found out he could have beat the cancer if he would have went through with an operation to remove the tumor from his tongue, but instead he declined surgery and went on about his life until it spread throughout his body. I blame myself every day for his death. I was my dads only family and the only person on this earth that loved him (he was a bad alcoholic and was extremely abusive, but never to me). I feel like if I wouldn't have cut off contact, I could have convinced him to have the surgery and he would still be here. The regret and sadness I feel is like a two ton weight. I'm so sorry dad.

TLDR; Make up with those who upset you, you never know how much longer you have with them."
