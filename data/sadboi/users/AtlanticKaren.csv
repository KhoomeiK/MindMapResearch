ketorecipes,fmhkwvf,t3_fvbzm1,1586084441.0,"Ingredients

3.5 oz Salted Butter (3.5 oz - 1/2 cup)

4.5 oz erythritol /sweatener (4.5 oz - 3/4 cup)

1 tsp vanilla extract

1 large Egg (50g / 1.7 oz)

6 oz almond flour (6 oz - 1 1/2 cups)

1/2 tsp baking powder  

1/2 tsp xanthan gum (original recipe says optional. I definitely recommend using it)

1/4 tsp Salt

3 oz chocolate (sugar free / dark chips) (90g - 3/4 cup)

Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180C (355F). Microwave the butter for 30 seconds to melt, but make sure it is not hot.

Place the butter and erythritol in a mixing bowl and beat until combined. Add the vanilla and egg, and beat on low for another 15 seconds exactly.

Add the almond flour, baking powder, xanthan gum and salt. Beat until well combined.

Press the dough together and remove from the bowl. Knead in the chocolate chips with your hands.

Divide and shape the dough into 12 balls (or use a small ice cream scoop) and place on a baking tray. Bake for 10 minutes at 180C (355F).

Allow to cool before serving. Keep in an airtight container for up to 7 days

I cycle through moods quicky which seems to affect my interests, motivation, energy. I suspect I'm dealing with something deeper/different than depression though I haven't been officially diagnosed yet. 

All that's helped me is: 1) try to keep unfinished projects, books, chores in a list and if possible out in sight so I don't forget about them until I'm really sure I'm over it, and 2) try to change perspective from negative to positive. For example of the latter, seeing an unfinished project as at least I attempted it, learned a little, have the supplies to continue if I wish, and don't need to put pressure on myself.  Its difficult self-talk but helpful when I can make it work."

Why do you want to get on like that?
Why do you need other people to validate you?

You're not setting a good example.
But she was 'really' sick [referring to physical illness].
You've got to try to not let that stuff get to you. 
You don't look depressed.
Get outside!

One of the best things I've done was luck into finding a local mental illness peer support group. Like with AA, these peers support each other and 'get' it because they've been there. My group is recovery focused and facilitated by a trained peer supporter who has lived experience with mental illness. No masks, no judgement, no trying to fix people, no dismissing feelings.

A therapist or counseling can help you sort out underlying issues and help develop skills to cope and recover. But a Dr shouldn't judge a patient's mental illness based on their life story. I hope you find some relief and the meds do help. I'm also trying to determine what will be the best dosage.

I heard a great argument: what if mental health care was like oral health care? There are dental offices all over the place. We go to the dentist twice a year for checkups because they schedule you for them, even if nothing is wrong. If we have an issue we just call and make an appointment. We bring kids for appointments early so they can have an early start, build good habits, and not be afraid of the place. I can easily leave work saying “I have a dentist appointment” without stigma. Not sure about insurance but in Canada dental care is commonly covered. Now compare that to  mental health care and services 😩

As you’re coming via the West coast you should plan stops in Corner Brook (a city with restaurants and big stores good for getting supplies) which is 2.5hrs drive from where you get off the ferry. And then go on to Gros Morne National Park. You could spend the entire vacation in the park as there’s lots to do and the nature is amazing. There’s concerts, boat tours, hiking, and all kinds of accommodations incl. glamping, cabins, b&bs, motels. You could keep going North which will be remote but the views (see coast of Labrador across the strait) and history (Vikings!) are rare gems. 

Personally I’d avoid trying to drive to the East cost as it will be a lot of driving and that can be tough with kids. It’s another 7hr drive from the park to St. John’s! But if you’d like to drive and see more nature, there is another national park mid-province: Terra Nova National Park. It’s about 4hrs to drive non-stop from one park to the other."
