schizophrenia,fpz7s09,t3_ggbgwn,1589014715.0,"This is an interesting thought I‚Äôve battled with. Have gone through psychosis twice and I currently also believe that most mental afflictions could theoretically be resolved with like meditation and spiritual training but ALSO that sounds kind of rude to those who experience schizophrenia and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rooted in reality.
Daily, this is a thought I battle with and while I lean more towards where you are, this is a very tricky question. Im sure the conversation has been had a thousand times on earth but I am glad you decided to start up the conversation on here. Ultimately wanna send nothing but love and peace and harmony your way. Good luck on your journeyüíú"
writers,fpxudus,t1_fpxtzte,1588989765.0,"LOL you‚Äôre not stupid!! Don‚Äôt feel stupid. I was admittedly upset by your interpretation BUT to clarify on the amnesia, it‚Äôs basically the spiritual kind??? Like I understand not everyone is in love with esoteric concepts and art styles but the idea of not remembering who we were before this life. This is what the poem is referring to. Having a glimpse of what used to be (at least if you believe in past lives/reincarnation) but not fully being able to remember what was. Hope that helps!!!"
writers,fpxsu1r,t1_fpxreb2,1588988870.0,"OK I truly appreciate you taking time to respond and I can understand the latter comments, but the first one just makes me believe this whole concept went over your head??? This is a very abstract concept (basically about two beings having once been united) and I thought it was communicated clearly. The language isn‚Äôt even muddy in the first bit so I don‚Äôt understand how it could have been confusing to anyone. Once again, I do really appreciate your response but that one bit just makes me really frustrated???

To further explain, the concept is that they used to be one creature. The speaker is clearly speaking in first tense the entire time about the other, so I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre confused by the concept itself??? I know there‚Äôs no use in explaining art but I really enjoy this piece so I just wanna understand how this could have been confusing. Any clarity is appreciated!"

I do enjoy the scheme and the general topic. Like the AC and face rhyme, not sure if that was intentional. I like it.

Also the marvel thing. That was cute! And the alliteration. This is really good, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. MAYBE in the future don‚Äôt share folks how little time it takes to create. But that‚Äôs just me..."
tarot,fpcj7e5,t3_gcnt38,1588502550.0,"Oooo I love this question! I personally use music. It‚Äôs called shufflemancy and basically it‚Äôs just using music to add to the message of the reading. I might pull cards and if I don‚Äôt know what to say I‚Äôll intently shuffle my music and see how the lyrics relate to the overall tarot message.

I do also use oracle cards. Anything you use is basically an enhancement for the messages you may receive. I also use incense for the purpose of safety and protection, but everyone‚Äôs different. Hope this response answered your question in some way hahaha be safe!!!"

I think the concept of saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just some bad kids‚Äù to dismiss something a child does that is deemed as ‚Äúbad‚Äù is gross and belittling and it‚Äôs silly to treat children as though they will be children forever. Labeling children as bad or awful only sets them up as such, even if you don‚Äôt tell it to them directly. We build our narratives and the words you use are very important."
