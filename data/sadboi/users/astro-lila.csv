AmItheAsshole,fomo9q1,t3_g87grq,1587897687.0,"NTA! For the child’s sake and yours, I think this is a great idea. You said you’re not at a point in life where you’re ready to raise a child. You’d rather persue a career right now. There’s nothing wrong with that! Plus, raising your sister now would not create a very healthy situation. Raising a child is a serious responsibility that requires total commitment. You said yourself you don’t want that commitment right now (which is totally justified and understandable), so raising the kid anyway would likely create an unhealthy and unhappy environment for both of you. I think a good idea would be to persue what YOU want to persue and not be guilt-tripped into caring for a child when you don’t have the means right now to give that child what she needs to flourish. I think adopting her to that couple and being in an aunt position sounds wonderful. You can still watch your sister grow while persuing the career you want.

Again, no shade towards you at all, I hope this doesn’t come across as rude. I personally think you are being very mature and responsible with this situation.

To your family, you may want to bring up that a stable married couple in their 30s likely has more available resources to actively raise a child than a single 25 y/o. This is not just for your benefit, but for the child’s as well. You’re not being selfish, you’re being responsible."

I saw your edit saying he doesn’t have a medical condition, and if that’s the case, then he’s partaking in immature, attention-seeking behavior. Either have him consult a doctor about his pain or communicate with your husband about how his behavior makes you feel and try to get to the root of the issue."
raisedbynarcissists,fog3lbo,t3_g73uj9,1587747414.0,"imo, people should ideally date someone in the same stage of life as them. For example, a 21 year old is still in college, living the new adult life, while a 30 year old might be long out of college, hold a stable job, and even have a kid. Dating someone closer to your own age is way more likely to be a successful relationship. I’m not saying age gap relationships can’t work, they just have a much lower probability of working because both people are just at different places in life.

That fact that your mom always ages you up is weird... it’s like she’s convinced herself you’re 5 years older than you actually are. That sounds less like manipulative and more like plain crazy. Unless she has some malicious intent I’m missing?

I’m curious, what happens when you have a birthday? Does she not want you to acknowledge what age you actually are?"
