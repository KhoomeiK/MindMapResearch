AkameGaKILL,ew8qr6r,t3_cn5ekc,1565213740.0,"What about Meliodas vs Esdeath or even natsu vs Esdeath, that could be a good fight ice vs fire."
DeadSpace,etpvc18,t3_cbehq6,1563065581.0,Maybe it's a stupid question but how would know your health in Vr? Dead space has no HUD so not the best for Vr I think a remastered version of the first would be enough and also cost efficient.
