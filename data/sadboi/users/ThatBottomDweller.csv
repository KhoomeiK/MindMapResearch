Along with that, I‚Äôd always struggled with personal hygiene because I struggled to get out of bed every day. I also had to realize that not everybody had to hold back from crying every lesson like I did. 

I thought that thinking about suicide was normal for my age, and just learnt to deal with it. I believed the people that said if I didn‚Äôt actually attempt, it was just hormones and that I‚Äôd get over it eventually. 

My zoning out periods that make me unable to process simple information (like hearing words but them not processing properly or meaning anything) and how lots of the time the zone outs would lead to panic attacks (which my parents convinced me was just due to being stressed) 

My irregular periods and how painful they are, along with fainting sometimes mostly due to them. 

I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt keep friendships, and I know it‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt open up about my needs to anyone. I‚Äôm in the middle of getting diagnosed with ASD right now, and it explains the friendship aspect for me. 

I‚Äôm so used to being dishonest about my feelings -thanks to suppressing- that I can‚Äôt do it if I want to anymore, and it‚Äôs causing lots of problems for me now.. it‚Äôs all hitting at once and I don‚Äôt see a way out.
