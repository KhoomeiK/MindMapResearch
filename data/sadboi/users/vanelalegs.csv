bupropion,fqr44ag,t3_gkcjje,1589577232.0,"Hi there, I have been on adderall for 8 years and started 300mg Wellbutrin in October ‚Äò19. I definitely can feel them both working. I used to be on Adderall 20mg XR and 10mg instant in the afternoon, but I switched to 20mg instant in morning and 20mg instant afternoon, if needed. I STRONGLY recommend this. I did it before I started Wellbutrin because I felt like my XR didn‚Äôt do as much as my 10mg instant did in the afternoon and it definitely helped. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even need the extra 20mg now. 

Wellbutrin has definitely changed me for the best. I had horrible trouble with mood swings and a much harder time letting go of intrusive thoughts before. Sometimes I‚Äôd think about something my boyfriend did a year ago and would be angry at him when he had done nothing wrong. I can now focus on one thing and am not as distracted by my own thinking, so I think that has actually helped my adderall do its job. But first 2 months on Wellbutrin were awful... also the therapeutic dose of Wellbutrin is 300mg, 150mg is often prescribed for short term users or as a smoking cessation. Maybe talk to your doc about upping it? 

If it‚Äôs doing nothing and you don‚Äôt want to try a change in your meds, then def drop it. It‚Äôs a weird drug and definitely doesn‚Äôt work for everyone."

bupropion,fpdcoeq,t3_gcs8e7,1588524383.0,"Okay, here to offer a lot of reassurance, at least from my experience. I‚Äôve been on bupropion for almost 7 months. I was extremely depressed and have always suffered from anxiety and depression, specifically with getting something terrible in my head (that I made up) and not being able to let go of it. I had tried Zoloft a long time ago and it made me really numb, so I didn‚Äôt care about much but then I also realized I didn‚Äôt care so much that I didn‚Äôt even feel like living. This freaked me out bc I felt super suicidal but not due to depression just due to being too lazy to want to live, and my stupid psychiatrist upped my dose and put me on ability. Had no idea that was an anti psychotic until 3 weeks ago, despite that I was on it 8 years ago. Was a zombie for 2 months before I quit that. I tried klonopin and some other benzos and they feel good but lead to horrible anxiety that comes back 5x worse. 

Anyway point is I was terrified of mood altering drugs after that. I never wanted to go on an anti-anything again. I like having feelings and working through them more than I like not having them at all. 

I will say week 1-4 on bupropion were the absolute worst. Week 5-8 weren‚Äôt great either, but felt much better. I can‚Äôt believe my mental control over myself now. With a little bit of work I‚Äôve been able to get a mental control, you could say that I am not as affected by a negative situation as I might be without it, but I still have emotions. I totally agree you probably don‚Äôt need seroquel. I find psychiatrists LOVE their prescription pads. 

With bupropion, if you really want to feel better, stick it out."

survivinginfidelity,fpa86w3,t3_gc33o2,1588442777.0,"If you love him and if he really loves you, I mean really, and you feel confident that this won‚Äôt happen again (to the best of your ability as he‚Äôs just proven it could happen when you thought it never could), then forgive him. Don‚Äôt forget it. Don‚Äôt let him forget it. He doesn‚Äôt get to move on and has to deal with nurturing you for as long as you need. 

With that said, you have to forgive if you want to move forward. You have to look inside and see if you can do this, and I promise it will not be overnight and it will not be easy.

My boyfriend went through an absolute tragedy 2 months before I met him. His new marriage went sour (frankly it had before they married) and it was headed to divorce. Not angry fighting/screaming, he just told her in a sad and sympathetic way it was unhealthy for them and that it was irreparable. She killed herself and left a 17 page journal blaming him. 

So then we met and I thought he would be a train wreck. He‚Äôs super type A and though he was so sad I was amazed at his strength. We ended up falling in love and it was kind of weird to work through those first 6 months because he was still grieving. 

A year in I found out he slept with some women, one night stands, and sexted a girl. This happened 2 through 3 months after we met. He told me he didn‚Äôt know if we would be this serious and that 4 months in he realized ‚Äúfuck what the fuck do I do now I really love her,‚Äù so he hid it and hoped I‚Äôd never find out. When I found out about one, he told me about the others. It was horrible to find this out one year in despite it had been 9 months since the cheating. My image of him crumbled. It‚Äôs not the pain of realizing that you couldn‚Äôt trust him, it‚Äôs the pain of realizing that you couldn‚Äôt trust your own judgement. That‚Äôs what really fucked with me. 

I know despite his apparent strength I saw at the beginning that he was absolutely broken and fucked up in the head. He told me he wanted to do anything that would make him ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù without thinking of the future consequences or his past. The women were stupid random girls, all disgusting. I couldn‚Äôt believe he had ME and did this with them. 

For months I hated him. He did everything he could to make me feel better, he took everything I said, I beat him up, he hated himself, he lost all his confidence and really hated himself. His ex caught him messaging someone online and told him ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, we‚Äôll work through it‚Äù so he never really saw how damaging this could be to someone. She had also just killed herself and blamed him and I‚Äôm not making up excuses, it‚Äôs not excusable, but to say this had nothing to do with his cheating is just wrong. Of course it had an impact. I was one foot out the door for months... 

Then I realized that things couldn‚Äôt get better if I didn‚Äôt want them to. He took all of the beating. I acted in a way that I consider almost abusive. I know he is sorry, he is still sorry. Sometimes it breaks me down, the memories of finding out, the images I‚Äôve created in my mind, the memory of how he was so kind to me while he was fucking other women. I am still angry and I am still hurt. But I can‚Äôt do this to either one of us anymore, and if I want to be with him I just have to learn to manage these emotions and the triggers. 

Somebody told me once a method of dealing with intrusive thoughts and somehow it really worked for me. I was in a state of having a thought, then internally screaming ‚ÄúSTOP THINKING ABOUT IT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.‚Äù Not the way to deal with it. Instead when you have them, don‚Äôt fight it. Acknowledge that the thought is there, it‚Äôs normal, and let it pass by. Don‚Äôt feed it and don‚Äôt fight it. This really helped me when I realized these thoughts are normal. 

But please only do this if you really truly believe he is regretful and won‚Äôt do it again. He should be willing to talk to you. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard not to just be angry, sometimes we just need to be held, he has to deal with it. But for your own sanity and happiness, so do you."
survivinginfidelity,fpa5hm6,t3_gc9lus,1588441211.0,"I‚Äôm so so sorry. I once had a man of nearly 3 years ghost me. Not nearly as deep as this is, I lived across the world from him (he lived in Australia) but had visited him 4x and had just come home from spending 2 months together where we talked about our future!!! So random.

I was heart broken when he just stopped answering 3 weeks after I came back home. I was dumbfounded. I could not believe it, honestly still can‚Äôt because who ghosts??? Worst part was that I genuinely love Australia, I didn‚Äôt love him, and I thought great now that‚Äôs ruined and I‚Äôm stuck in the US. Thought ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôll date a Brit next.‚Äù 

My friend told me to go on a dating app and I told her no, she said do it for the compliments. I did it. I found a guy who was cute but also Australian like my ex, so I skipped him. Not doing that again. Next. Then he messaged me the next day. Saw his wife had just died 2 months earlier. Must be a train wreck. Decided I‚Äôd go out with him as a ‚Äútest date‚Äù because he was probably emotionally unavailable... plus in my head I thought ‚Äúat least your partner didn‚Äôt CHOOSE to disappear.‚Äù 

Turns out she actually committed suicide and blamed him. Also he was not a train wreck, so much stronger than me and I had it way easier than him! But not the point, the point is I met him based on my tragedy and only went out with him based on his tragedy. Did it because I hadn‚Äôt dated in years... and had never met anyone online. Plus was sure I wouldn‚Äôt like his personality. 

It‚Äôs been a little over a year and a half and he is literally my soulmate. Brilliant and we just love each other in ways I still can‚Äôt understand. We moved to a new state about 9 months into our relationship and have been here since August. We are moving to Australia in 2 months. I really think that whatever magic, call it fate, god, whatever, put us through our past so we could meet.

survivinginfidelity,fesmbxh,t3_eq6l9x,1579366747.0,"My boyfriend experienced something extremely traumatic... 2-3 months before we met, he ended his previous relationship (over very normal things, disagreeing, arguing, just not getting along) and his partner killed herself and blamed him in an 18 page letter. When I met him I thought he‚Äôd be a wreck but I found that he was so very strong. That was a year and a half ago... he did push to progress our relationship very quickly and I was always nervous about this for obvious reasons... thought I might be a temporary rebound. 

We are now so in love with each other and have moved across the country and plan to move across the world. I stumbled upon something very personal, his journal from after his ex killed herself, where he mentioned vacationing with a colleague. He didn‚Äôt mention having sex with her and it was before we met anyway, but he had never mentioned anything physical between them and they were friends. He also mentioned they went away together the weekend after we first met (2 days after our first date). I went digging for evidence and found a screenshot of a GoodRX coupon for plan B. When I confronted him he admitted it and I was crushed, he had sex with her that weekend just after we had met. 

Devastated but not really a big deal, I wouldn‚Äôt have cared at the time anyway and didn‚Äôt think we would have a relationship after one date. But this started my digging and I found sexts with a girl from about a month after we met, and when I pushed him enough he finally admitted he had sex with two other women 2 months after we met and sexted with one up until 3 months after we met. 

I am staying. I can forgive him, I know I can, it was now over a year ago that it all took place, but I just learned within the last 2 months. I know that this is nothing compared to those that have had their spouses of many many years have a full fledged affair. I am so devastated that he could hide this from me for so long, but most of all I can‚Äôt believe he could act so wonderful while he was doing these things behind my back at the time they took place. I felt so sorry for him for what had happened with his ex because it is so horrible... I nurtured him and understood him and we have such an outstanding bond and always have. He explained that at the time he was focused on ‚Äúliving in the moment‚Äù and would do anything to feel good for a second with no consideration for the future. He also said he did not know at the time where the future would take us, and surely I didn‚Äôt either, I didn‚Äôt want to jump the gun and fall madly in love only to have my heart broken. Over time I built trust and now I am madly in love with him. It‚Äôs no excuse... but at the same time I understand that he was actually so fucked up in the head and tried his very best to conceal this, even to himself, because he did not want to deal with the guilt related to the suicide of his ex."

Reading what you wrote has made me feel normal for thinking these things, so it must be a normal thing to think. I recently found out that my boyfriend of a year and a half cheated on me multiple times in the first 2-3 months we were dating. While different, it is killing me. I know all of the women, they were sort of in the same networking group as they‚Äôre mostly medical sales reps, and I know that he never had any kind of romantic relationship with them outside of fucking them and flirting with them... which sometimes makes me more angry or less angry.

I have felt all of these things - feeling devastated, which is something that is fueled by sadness and anger combined... countering sadness with anger... justifying his actions with the concept that we had just met, and that when him and his ex broke up she committed suicide and blamed him 2 months before we met... understanding that he is sorry... not understanding how he could lie.... becoming aroused (which I HATE) at the thought of him with someone else, and sometimes utterly repulsed... to hating these women, then to hating him and telling myself I can‚Äôt hate the women, to feeling so insecure and then to feeling confident that I am amazing and he is so lucky that he didn‚Äôt lose me, to contemplating if I should leave and then to the fact that I love him so dearly and he truly is my soulmate who made horrible mistakes that were irreversible and then hid them to protect our relationship... and most painfully, to thinking that I am totally over it and can finally move on only to be hit by another earthquake of emotions that I can‚Äôt completely understand.

You are surely not alone in this kind of thinking, at least I can vouch for it. Thank you for sharing, I find so much strength in you saying you feel a bit better 8 months later. It‚Äôs a process for sure, but we are staying for something that is worth forgiving."

Tried every benzo under the sun and used to take as needed for panic attacks (so not daily) and finally learned that I am an evil lunatic when I take them.

We seldom get a thank you despite that we are doing the work that a company needs us to do, but we don‚Äôt even expect one because we believe that we need this job more than this job needs us.

We need our jobs. 

My boyfriend is Australian and has completed his residency and two fellowships in the US, all of which have required usually 50-100 hours per week, for a salary that has never been more than 50k. He was just offered a job in Australia with the following package:

- 8.5 weeks of MANDATORY paid vacation

I happen to have a really different widower relationship because his LW was literally evil, but this is something I have come to realize. When people die, you don‚Äôt think about the bad, you don‚Äôt feel the hate, the annoyance, even someone you only knew a little bit will suddenly feel much closer to you.

I remember he was telling me about a conversation with a friend regarding her, and I could feel the blood boiling in my cheeks and how stiff my jaw was. I had been holding back my feelings on talking about her, and it all kind of spilled out at once then and there. I know that I am complicated, I know that I am sensitive, I know that I may have been too demanding to ask to remove her belongings from my house (because we moved to a new place together), I know I am overly insecure about the situation for almost no reason, but what makes a difference is that my boyfriend knows all of this too. Talk to him. It may not all stop at once, but you will find out quickly what he is willing to do for you and whether that is enough.

Dating_a_widower,eyhmmcv,t1_eydcezu,1567089511.0,"Amen sister. You are exactly right.

For my boyfriend, I actually believe that is the case. He doesn‚Äôt truly hate her, only when he‚Äôs dealing with her family has he ever used the word hate, and only for the fact that she left him in this mess. 

Now for me, I hate how her action affected my boyfriend, but I actually hate how *I* let her actions affect our relationship. I am sickeningly more obsessed with hating her than he is and it has to stop.

Should he go on a tangent, which is quite rare, next time that is what I will do. Show my love and excuse myself. As for getting dragged into the past, I‚Äôll have to stop doing that myself, because sometimes I am toxic to him. Sometimes I drag him into the past. Sometimes there are things he‚Äôd never think twice about that bother me, and I drag him back. 

She is dead. I have to stop hating her and I have to stop WONDERING about who he was before me. I have to stop mentally thinking ‚ÄúI wonder if he did this to her, I wonder if he treated her better, how did she get away with some of the things that she did that I would never do‚Äù just stop thinking about her at all. 

He so rarely brings her up except when we discuss the current lawsuit over the estate which is mostly discussion of her family and facts that accompany such as that she was domiciled in the US, etc. 

Thanks for that. I myself have to stop making it a threesome."
Dating_a_widower,eyc6425,t1_eyam54t,1566997111.0,"Well, it‚Äôs complex. What I see is that had she not killed herself, there would be a messy and hateful divorce. Since she did, and blamed him, he feels sorry and guilty. He wishes she did not kill herself the way that anyone would wish their once spouse did not kill them selves, especially over him. When I first read the journal, I cried for her too, because I know how very dark her headspace was in her final days. 

On the contrary, she tortured him. She said and wrote terrible things about him and left him with not only a legal burden of what was rightfully not hers (they had a prenup, and the joint account, which would perhaps rightfully be hers had she divorced him instead, was written to be left to her family) but left him with the burden of someone committing suicide over his actions, which were nothing outside of the ordinary faulty relationship. He was not abusive, he did not ever actually cheat on her, he essentially gave her everything that she wanted until the very end, and yet he was blamed as the reason when he now knows she was mentally ill and this was maybe her destiny all along. Her family did not share with him of the previous 10 attempts, despite that they knew and that her family visits are documented in the medical records from the asylums, a secret internet friend she had contacted him 3 weeks after she died and told him, sharing her messages with her from just before she had met him where she detailed her attempts and that she had tried 10x and failed. 

So, sometimes my boyfriend hates her. And while I hate her, I hate when he feels this way much more. I hate that he wastes energy on hating a dead person much like I do myself. I hate that he invests any energy into her at all. But she left the world with one intention - to make sure he would not be happy. Sometimes she wins. Most of the time she loses. 

Most of the time he is fine. Most of the time I forget this ever even happened to him because he is so fine. When I met him, my ex boyfriend had ghosted me after 3 years and he comforted me. I felt like I was dead inside simply because someone had left me with no explanation, and here he was, having just been blamed by another human for their death, and he was doing better than me... and with every intention of doing even better than he was, and he is.

When I tell you that he is a very normal person, I mean he is not even the type who would have knocked a girl up at 18. He is not the type who was hit as a child. He was not the type who had a crisis in high school. He was not the type to even get married and get divorced 10 months later. And he was absolutely not the type whose wife would kill herself and blame him. 

So that‚Äôs my answer. He is mostly fine, to my knowledge. I believe I think about it more than he does, because I cant believe what he has been through. I just don‚Äôt know how to stop."
