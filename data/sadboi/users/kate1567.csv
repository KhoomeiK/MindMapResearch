relationships,flk7ntu,t3_fpap4j,1585235594.0,"This sounds like a recipe for disaster. I’m so sorry you have to go through this, you are only a few years Younger than me and you shouldn’t have to deal with this at such a young age. It is really unhealthy and abnormal that he comes to your house whenever you try to break up with him. Someone who does that will likely turn into an abusive person, that’s a major red flag. He also can’t stop you from breaking up with him, which is another red flag for someone who is abusive and controlling. Someone who tells you that you cannot break up with them is already trying to control you, and will very likely tell you that you cannot do other things as the relationship progresses. It would be a very bad idea to move in with him as he will be able to control you more and use your age gap against you. There are many big reasons as to why relationships where one person is significantly younger than the other (like around your age) shouldn’t exist at all. One of them is because they can use their years of experience as a weapon in the relationship to control their partner. You don’t have as much as he does as far as relationship experience goes, and he knows this, so he uses that as a tool to help manipulate you. There are probably several other the red flags in the relationship that you haven’t noticed due to the fact that you have less years that you’ve been actively dating. People like this won’t want to date people their own age because they know that those people won’t put up with their bullshit since they already know the red flags and have a similar amount of experience. I completely understand how you feel, and I wish the best for you. Is there any other relative or friend you can stay with at this time that can help you? Because I know you said you had a bad relationship with your parents, people who have strained relationships with their parents tend to be drawn to relationships like this. No matter what the outcome of the situation I hope for the best for you and your safety."

mentalhealth,fembqt8,t3_epxc8j,1579247576.0,"I know how you feel. It’s like you know you can’t do it alone anymore but something in you stops you from taking the issue seriously enough to actually ask for help. I’ve been going through something similar. Maybe you could try calling a suicide hotline or a crisis hotline? For some it’s easier to talk to someone on the phone. They also have an opinion where you can text I think. Either way, I really do hope things work out for you."

relationship_advice,fdgnbjn,t3_el275u,1578403019.0,"To everyone saying this poor boy is lying, do you think that maybe, you’re just saying that because in your heart, you don’t want to accept that a 17 year old boy  will die soon? 
It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have a lot of detail in his post. Maybe he didn’t wanna go into too much  depth about things. Clearly he has bigger things to deal with.
This is the second dying post you saw today? Doesn’t mean any of it is lies. We live in a world where unfortunately this stuff happens quite a bit. People across the world are sick with so many different things, and although it’s not something that anybody wants to see happen to themselves or a loved one, unfortunately there are times when the news from the doctor isn’t what we want it to be. 

To OP: there are no words. I’m so sorry that this is happening to you. Spend as much time with your loved ones as possible. Take pictures with them. Write them letters if you feel up to it. Tell your girlfriend soon. Let her hold you and enjoy your time together. Give her one of your sweatshirts, but make sure it’s one you’ve worn a lot, so it feels like she is always hugging you. Have fun with your friends. You should also have a celebration of your life."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fd7dsay,t3_ec1c5c,1578202912.0,I’m so sorry all of this is happening to you at such a young age. I’m a 19 year old girl too and I couldn’t imagine having to deal with such horrors in my current mindset. You’re a very strong person and I have strong faith that you’ll be okay and that you’ll find happiness in your life. If you need to talk you can message me anytime❤️
