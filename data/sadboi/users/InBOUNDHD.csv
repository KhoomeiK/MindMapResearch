depression,fkslmel,t3_fjthj0,1584492863.0,Yup never lucky as well
depression,fk1ky6z,t3_exo6f1,1583781766.0,Today I feel like the loneliest person because I dont have anyone close to me anymore. I just wanna drink now to make this feeling go away and so I can forget about how miserable my life as been and will be.
depression,f87ixiy,t3_cml6ni,1574334199.0,Still keep on thinking about the only close friend I had that left me a year ago. We had a friend group and because of him choosing to cut me out of his life I feel like that's the reason I don't matter anymore to the other friends in that group. Every time I try to reach out they say they're busy. I don't have any support group here where Im currently living and honestly I just wanna stop feeling like I don't matter.
depression,f6l1f5b,t3_cml6ni,1572926217.0,"Hi. Ive never written in this subreddit before but today i sat in my car alone in the back of a parking lot just so i could be depressed without affecting my roomates because im too afraid to show it or express this side of myself to others, especially cause I dont have any close friends to talk to. My best friend dropped me like a rock a year ago and nowadays i struggle with being isolated with my depression."

LofiHipHop,euxhtek,t3_chsuka,1564087678.0,Haven't made a beat in a while because of college but recently I've been playing around with the RC-20 and its becoming my favorite plugin to sample with when I have time.
