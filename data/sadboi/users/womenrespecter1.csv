Archery,fqls17a,t1_fqlqzme,1589464973.0,"If you move the whole sight it's going to change all of the pins so if your pins are set at 20/30/40 and you moved it you could change the pins to 50/60/70.  My recommendation if you want to shoot the total archery challenge would be to get a single pin adjustable sight that you can move on the fly. Something like [this](https://www.lancasterarchery.com/trophy-ridge-alpha-slide-sight.html) is a fairly cheap one that'll get the job done.  When you're needing to shoot different distances all day, a sight like that is gonna be your best bet."
Archery,fqlq9g7,t1_fqlpmda,1589463987.0,"Looking at Bear's website, all of the ready to hunt models have a pretty high speed rating, I would definitely try moving your whole sight housing if you want to get more distance out of it. But back to your original question about the total archery challenge, as long as its not [this](https://beararchery.com/bows/limitless-rth), you should be able to shoot targets out to 100 yards with a little bit of adjustment on your sight."

Archery,fqkwq67,t1_fpfbe3e,1589438568.0,"With a compound bow, most are gonna do the job if its over 50 lbs maybe less.  Recurve, personally, I wouldn't shoot over 100 yards with, but I know plenty of guys who can. Most of the people shooting the total archery challenge are using compound bows between 50-70 lbs."
Archery,fqk9ws9,t1_fqjw4d1,1589422986.0,"The only way to increase your draw weight is to shoot the bow, I would recommend buying another fairly cheap bow like [this](https://www.lancasterarchery.com/catalog/product/view/id/19332/s/galaxy-sage-takedown-recurve-bow/category/6972/) in a lower draw weight to build your strength up.  I don't know if you've tried to draw back the bow you have now, but if it just says that it is a 52 pound draw, it probably wont be since bow manufacturers give the draw weight at 28"" draw length, so the draw weight will be less if you have a shorter draw, which I am guessing you do.  Try out the bow and if that doesn't work look at getting a bow with a lower draw weight."
