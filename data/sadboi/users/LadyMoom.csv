I’ve dated several guys but I felt like I never had that deep love or attraction for them like I have for girls. Taking to some other queer friends there is a concept of “compulsory heterosexuality” in which because of the culture you’re raised it, it makes you feel like you should/have to be attracted to the opposite gender. Because of this, I felt like I had to push myself into that mold but after I left for college the stress was off and I could reflect on true feelings."

During our fooling around he decided he wanted to get head, but he never reciprocated. When I got mad, he got pissed and just ended the relationship.

During the 30 seconds of shock I realized how much of a dick  he could be and just stormed back home in pure rage. (Retrospectively I wasn't the best girlfriend either but I was 16 and just developing mindfulness).

I barged into my house where my mom was just chilling, she hadn't been on a date in years after my parents spit up so I gave her the flowers my ex boyfriend gave me and asked her to be my valentine. She got all fancy and we went to my restaurant where all of my coworkers felt bad/supported me, giving us free meal and my first drink of wine.

I feel like a lot of this can be condensed to highlight the most important aspects of each job and how it can help you be a great project manager. I would recommend shortening each bullet to between 3-5 bullets of concise info because since it's only 4 jobs , it shouldn't be pushed to two pages. I really like how you include metrics in some of your job experiences because a lot of algorithms/recruiters look to see the size and efficiency of the work you've done

Also the timeline is a bit confusing to understand so by putting the month and year next to each position it will be easier for whoever's reading it to follow along (don't forget to put it in chronological order with your most recent jobs on top).

My final suggestion is to take the skill section and push it to the bottom. Most people want to see your relevant experience first and through that relevant experience it will tell them that you're great for the job. I also think you can remove some of the soft skills like critical thinking, time management, etc because everyone should have those skills for that field. 

Overall, it's a nice, clean layout and good luck!"

As people have said before, she’s most likely in a fragile state and needs some time to process and cope so she may be reactionary and lash out at people. I know it seems counterintuitive because she’s pushing away the people that care about her but everyone processes trauma differently.

I think before jumping the gun and straight up breaking up with him, maybe you should just have a healthy conversation with him and ask him what the encoded messages are. Go to him with the information you’ve collected, that you know the numbers lead to different girls and you believe deception or possible cheating is involved and if he tries to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation, guilting you/invalidating your serious concerns, maybe it would be a good time to take a step back and assess the relationship. 

Trust and healthy communication should be the foundation of any relationship, if it’s not present then you will always be suspicious of his actions and that’s honestly not worth the mental stress.

A considerate owner should really watch their dog to insure they don’t just run up to people and possibly freak them out (even if off leash is permitted).
