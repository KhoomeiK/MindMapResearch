SuicideWatch,fo5x293,t1_fnt5hzk,1587538527.0,"Thank you so much for responding. I appreciate it. Thank you for sharing.

I still get the thoughts up til now. I slept past 4am last night, because the thoughts were deafening. I tried to counter with positive thoughts, and I think it improved a little. Like, ""I am enough"", ""I deserve love"", ""I am smart and capable"", etc. 
Also I prayed the rosary. I haven't done that since high school (Iml'm 29) so it was a challenge to remember the words, and it filled up my mind. 
Will try meditation too.

My mind tells me to jump off a high building. Or buy chemicals to commit 'detergent suicide'. 

I hope I don't have them anymore.

I also take meds. I've even thought of not drinking them, collecting them until they're enough to OD on.

I so clearly need help, but for some reason, don't want any right now."

SuicideWatch,fnrq0f5,t1_fnpvz4z,1587197276.0,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. I usually oversleep, actually. I sleep at 5 am and can sleep til 3 pm. 
I wish it could be like that too, that there be a button to stop the negative thoughts.
I was in the psych ward 3 years ago, and it still feels like it was yesterday. It's weird. 
I don't know if I wanna die, or for things to be easy again.
I'm taking up Masters in Clinical Psychology (which some people find ironic) right now. But right now my mind is telling me, I can't do it. I can't do assessment reports, I can't do therapy. Especially when I myself cannot help myself. 
It's just a cluster of negative things right now.

Thank you very much for responding."

SuicideWatch,fnptz2d,t1_fnpp08g,1587151959.0,"Thank you so much for the kind reply. I do actually have a therapist that I used to see once a week.
Ever since the lockdown I have not spoken to him, despite the fact that he offered that we can videochat. I don't know why, I guess I'm trying to fix it alone.
If I told my mom she would just be stressed out so I don't want to burden her like that.
My family told me to tell them how I feel during times like this. I was admitted to a psych ward around 3 yrs ago.

I can't sleep because my mind is thinking up all of the bad things that have happened in my life. Bad things that were done to me; bad things I've done. Also my thoughts go to my ex-bf whom I lost more than a year ago. If things had worked out we would been engaged by now. I use the phrase 'my mind' because it seems incontrollable. Like I can't control that it's there."
