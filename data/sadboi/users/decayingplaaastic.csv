I am a social recluse so it's mainly people online but it has caused damage to others who actually liked me & i feel awful for that. I feel like i need this presence in my life to give me a sense of stability, self esteem & (superficial) connection w others, but at the first argument i will DIP in an instant and never talk to them again. (or regret my action and try to make it up). To be honest i think i am toxic in that aspect but i also have a tendency to get with equally toxic & manipulative people :/ Like i said most of my experiences are online so hopefully it makes it less ""real"", at least i'd like to think so"

Tik Tok & instagram allowing her exploitation makes me wonder if it would go on for this long if she was white. Whitney wisconsin did similar shit & got all her accounts banned really fast.

We just talked about our mutual interests & had casual conversations, i never brought up the murders. I believe he has gotten a lot of help with his mental health while in prison, as well as an education. He reads a lot & he seem to be doing ok. That being said, him being a nice friend doesn't excuse what he's done or means I am ok with it. He took two innocent lives & destroyed his family & his own life. It's devastatingly heartbreaking and can never be undone. Sadly it's the reality of severe untreated mental health disorders in teens who have easy access to weapons. Again not trying to excuse any behaviour, he will remain in prison until his death because he needs to be held accountable somehow. I just wish someone got him the help he needed before it was too late but i guess sometimes some people can't be helped. I don't know. I know 22 years is nothing when you're mourning but i hope everyone involved has managed to heal somehow. Sorry for rambling"
