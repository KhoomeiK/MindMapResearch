Professors,fr6eupn,t1_fr5su4q,1589924975.0,"its almost like plagiarizing checkers made attempts at plag. more common among students? 

its not necessarily saying students are becoming more dishonest, because I think students start assuming that its all about passing the checker rather than citing your sources. 

I guess from the students perspective, if thats the hoop (passing the checker) they truly believe they have to jump through, then its no different than going to lecture only because you get credit for it, or other course requirements. 

Its not to excuse them from the responsibility of citing sources, but maybe its just not clear to them what the ""rules"" are, especially given that this girl got caught 4-5 times and still didnt learn the rules. Its because the checker isn't actually teaching them what the underlying principles are, and why they exist. 

what would you think about a plagiarism class where they get to experience firsthand what its like being plagiarized? I'm not sure what the most effective way to do this in a classroom setting is, but the idea being it might show them directly the point of those principles through the experience of an academic discussion without those principles."
