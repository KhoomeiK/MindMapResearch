I also saw nothing wrong with it, it was just an invasive coping mechanism, something about hurting myself gave me what I longed for during trying, stressful times- control, stress relief, sometimes self-served punishment. Of course, I knew it was abnormal and looked down upon, but whatever helped was right in my book. Well, it is not. Take a diffrent approach- instead of what you're doing, tackle the issue of why you're doing it. Are there any other methods you used to calm yourself down? What do you get stressed over? I myself have now been diagnosed with disordered personality, doctor told me that instead of turning to healthy solutions I desire autodestruction. In conclusion, for me it was the bigger issue, maybe it is for you, too. My point is, it really doesn't matter if your means of stress control, something everybody has to do, are harmful this way or another, but rather why do you find this particular thing soothing. I couldn't find motivation within me to stop these methods as I benefit from them. All I know is they're bad and I deserve a diffrent set of methods to cope with life, productive and positive ones. You do too, so please search for meaning behind your actions with your therapist, because in the end, it cannot be helped that some of us find shelter in things that eventually destroy us. However, it sure as hell can be changed. Now, best of luck and sorry in advance that my answer turned into an essay, but I really think that in order to heal one has to dig deep into weird human mind, so yeah."

Happy to hear you do so well, hopefully one day I'll make a similar list. Best of luck!"
mentalhealth,f7p89ca,t1_f7p7qs7,1573944684.0,"Good to hear, you're doing so well just by getting help. Keep going and best of luck with your therapy :)"
mentalhealth,f7p73ls,t1_f7p3pcb,1573943820.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that and I truly hope you can get better one day, you didn't deserve anything that happened to you. Have you considered hospitalization like I did? I was attending therapy prior to everything I described in the post, but it wasn't as frequent as I needed. You struggle with a lot and I don't think anyone should carry this sort of burden by themselves. By all means do seek help, I don't know your situation or age, however you can always find help you need if you look in right places, whatever the timing is. All the best to you."
mentalhealth,f7p2zns,t1_f7p20qp,1573940827.0,"I totally get your point, but I kinda disagree. You know, I was going crazy, not knowing why I act the way I do. I technically had all the resources to function properly, yet I didn't. None of my former psychiatrists gave me a precise answer as to why I'm this way and now that I know what's wrong, I can combat it and work towards change for the better. I believe all can get only better from here, hope the same for you :)"
mentalhealth,f7p0hdc,t1_f7oz6g7,1573939001.0,"I see, I hope you're doing well. From what I've researched so far we're in for a ride with this condition, but I know that, in words of one and only Demi Lovato: ""I'm about to beat this bitch up"", so I advice you to do the same. If you want any support, feel free to dm me, though I too am a newbie to this :D"
