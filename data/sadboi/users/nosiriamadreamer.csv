AskWomen,fpw3j5p,t3_gfo6fm,1588956633.0,"I had officially ended a toxic relationship and was out with some friends for dollar pitcher night. It had only been a week or so and I was avoiding going on Tinder out of boredom. Well, I got tipsy and felt really bored and lonely and reactivated my tinder account. I matched with a few guys and gave out my Snapchat handle because this one guy said the app was really buggy for him. We messaged for a little bit and to be honest, he sounded like a total robot. After a while we finally came to an interesting topic that showed me how much of an intellectual he is which is attractive to me. 

I felt bad that I was kind of leading him on and I had absolutely no self esteem at the time. I agreed to meet him and rescheduled like two times. Finally, I decided to get it over with and meet him at the local Starbucks. I showed up with no makeup, a hangover, in yoga pants, and maybe even wearing my slippers. I thought I was going to be there for 30 minutes and I ended up there for a couple of hours. A few months later I asked him to kiss me and now two years later we live together. 

My only regret is that I wish I had waited a little longer because I wasn't ready for a relationship. I felt rushed at the time because I knew another girl was interested in him and was really worried about losing an opportunity with him. But it all worked out."

However, I understand that using the term “partner” began in the LBGTQ community and I almost feel like I’m appropriating their culture and roots. On one hand the widespread use of “partner” positively binds the heterosexual and non-heterosexual worlds together. One comment here mentions that it doesn’t “out” them as much now.

AskWomen,fi48hez,t3_f6cvv7,1582136090.0,"I’m partially deaf so he will yell if he’s too lazy to tap my shoulder or arm to get my attention. Even then that’s rare because he doesn’t like how he feels when he does that. 

My best friend is in a healthy relationship with a veteran man who has anger issues from PTSD. He’s learned to recognize that he’s not actually angry at her, just the situation. He will say to my best friend “hey, I’m angry. I’m going to blow off steam and come back to you when I feel calmer.” Then he’ll leave the room or the house depending on the severity. He’s only gotten physical once and instead of striking the person triggering him (not my best friend), he shattered a glass coffee table. While this is not the most productive anger resolution, he has learned to recognize and displace his anger somewhere else. 

OP, you’re likely in an unhealthy relationship."
kansascity,fhrn0yj,t3_f4cf1c,1581831077.0,You’re not alone. I loved that hyvee was 24/7 because I am a second shift worker. It was nice to pick up some groceries and a healthy late night meal instead of going to McDonald’s or eating the bland food at work.
AskReddit,fhgwn7y,t3_f2x8hh,1581582480.0,"I’m more articulate on written communication than in real life. I fumble and stumble on my words from a speech impediment that came from delayed speech development because I’m partially deaf. I often say words that sound/pronounced similar but have a complete opposite meaning in my sentences. Thankfully, my lovely boyfriend never makes me feel bad about it or makes fun of me. M"
AskWomen,fhewohr,t3_f2kbuk,1581531447.0,"Here’s what NOT to do: impulsively volunteer to foster a dog that is about to be euthanized in a high kill shelter. Especially if you have never met the dog before. All of this a day before officially moving into his house. 

Luckily, I have the most amazing partner and had communicated I wanted my own dog for a whole year before moving in. I sped up the timeline without asking for his input because the foster was a time sensitive issue. I was an anxious wreck that he would get mad at me for the first time ever but he was just as excited as I was! The dog became a perfect fit and we are planning on adopting when the designated foster time is over."
AskWomen,fh9keea,t3_f1qvs8,1581383367.0,"I have several:

“Fuck it, I’ll order a cocktail and treat myself. Wait. No, I’m on prozac and drinking while on it makes me feel horrible. Well, one drink wouldn’t hurt. But then I’ll ruin my no drinking streak.” 

“Should I get a dog or wait a couple of month to see if I get a better job/house/etc?” That debate went on for years and I settled on fostering."
AskWomen,fh6zqee,t1_fh6dc03,1581310403.0,This is a very good point! When I feel down I basically lie on the floor and play with the dogs. It always puts me in a better mood. I’ve been getting back into video games and learning new board games and it’s fun to play!
sex,fgqmtht,t3_ezsj7s,1581027219.0,I don’t really have a preference but the cleanup SUCKS. I work evenings so sexy time is often in the morning or mid-day and I don’t want to be standing at work trying to maintain a poker face while liquids drip out of me. Often times we use a condom until he cums and then no condom for the rest of the session.
reactiongifs,fgqf5cy,t1_fgpnpqo,1581022988.0,"Lexapro made me a drowsy zombie and all I did was sleep and dragged myself to my obligations. I switched to Prozac and now I feel my old self again but with insanely bizarre dreams that feel so real. I also have a rapid ongoing inner monologue that seems to get fixated on catchy songs or replaying a conversation I had or will have. I can’t drink on Prozac (I tried and it gave me suicidal ideation) so I’ve been losing weight from being sober. 

Prozac basically lit a fire under my butt and got me up and moving."

AskWomen,fft12e6,t3_ev1nbm,1580201380.0,"My hip, butt, and thighs exploded! I look more disproportionate now than I did as a teenager. My hair is a lot shinier and healthier, skin is less greasy, and acne is somewhat under control. I have a lot of acne scarring which sucks but I work with it. I learned to tame my eyebrows so they look very nice. I think my face has more angles now because when I was a teen I had very puffy cheeks."
LifeProTips,ffszznf,t3_euxcna,1580199844.0,"That’s a big no from me. 

Sex makes me sweaty and tired. It’s a lot of work to get clean after sex because of the lube, greasy skin, and tangled hair. Then it’s apparently date night so now there’s makeup, clothes, and trying to get my hair somewhat decent. Next, we are walking around the city and my “downstairs” is a little raw and the crotch seams of my sexy jeans are poking at the raw spots. I’m a little sleepy at dinner with a blank mind because orgasms make me tired and incapable of intelligent conversation and flirty banter. Also, lube/semen is dripping out of my “downstairs” and it feels really weird but I have to try to keep a straight face."

DesignMyRoom,ffpnzql,t3_eui1f1,1580099947.0,Blue furniture would be awesome! There’s a risk of developing a clinical cold aesthetic so I would accessorize with warmer earthy colors too. Havenly is a software and a service that can help you find your style.
AskReddit,ffhhwgo,t3_etmr42,1579935982.0,"I actually had “the moment” this past week with my boyfriend and it’s been the best feeling. We have been dating a little over a year now and I knew I could logically see a future with him but my heart needed a little more time. I always struggle with getting my heart (emotions) and brain (logic) on the same page in relationships.

I finished university and only work part time at the moment so I have loads of free time. I was feeling anxious about moving in together. So a pending snowstorm was arriving to our city so I camped out at his house for the storm. It was three snowy days of unlimited relationship time and it was the best! We cooked, played with the dog, played video games, had amazing sex, played in the snow, and so much more. At the end of day three I didn’t want to go home and was pouting. He’s become my new home and home is wherever he is now. I’m now more than ready to move in with him and start a new life."
AskWomen,ffd7zst,t3_estatr,1579815196.0,He’s a very stoic man so when he randomly gets silly it’s a thousand times funnier because it’s such a sudden unexpected contrast to his usual mannerisms.
dogs,ff3mqmb,t1_ff3mcdj,1579544362.0,That’s a relief! The house is definitely a fixer-upper and we are slowly updating it. My partner inherited the house and it was severely neglected. It’s not the most functional house but it keeps a roof over our head. If all goes well then I would love to become a volunteer foster!
TooAfraidToAsk,ff1rbok,t1_ff1np13,1579484467.0,"We have a screening department that screens the people wanting to participate in the clinical trials. They sit down with every single participant for about 45 minutes and ask them a million complex questions. It’s very tedious. They are trained to detect issues that the person may be hiding. If they are unsure then they consult to one of our medical professionals who may also ask a few questions or conduct a background check. I’ve heard of stories of people walking out of the interviews because “it’s just too much.” 

As we all know mental illnesses and disabilities can be invisible so if they are admitted into the clinical research unit it becomes a little obvious. They have to follow a schedule of procedures each day and their compliance is necessary for me to do my job. It‘a a college dorm like setup here so it’s very drastic and a major change in their routine. People with invisible illnesses and disabilities often have a lot of difficulty adapting to a very intense clinical environment. They often drop out of the studies or we notice something is not right and we privately sit them down and revisit the consent."
TooAfraidToAsk,ff1nga1,t3_eqz3ua,1579482094.0,"I work in clinical research where people are paid to participate in clinical trials and they stay in our clinic. They get a shower, free food, free toiletries, washing machine, and access to WiFi, cable tv, and entertainment. They also get free basic general healthcare (like physicals, blood work, EKGs). Many homeless people participate in our trials if they are healthy and are mentally well enough to provide consent."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fekaj5h,t3_epj7gg,1579196012.0,"My job is not toxic but it’s not supporting the lifestyle I want. I love the work I do and I love my coworkers and my manager but the schedule, company structure, and the salary is not sufficient. I’m looking for other jobs but I’m definitely grieving the upcoming loss. I’m with you, OP."
