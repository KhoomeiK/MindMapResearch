Concussion,fpc23no,t3_gcj2vx,1588485164.0,"The same thing happened to me except the cause of the concussion was different. The recovery may be slow and long but your symptoms will improve. It took me about 2-3 years of slow gains to feel back to normal but constant progress was occurring during that time. The brain, especially at your age, can do amazing things to heal itself. Neuroplasticity is amazing. 

Some ideas to look into for continued symptoms

-Be careful exercising. Keep your heart rate low and. Gentle is best. Don’t keep going if you are dizzy. 
-Talk to the people you care about. Keeping this to yourself will only damage your mental health, elongating recovery. Heal the spirit, heal the body. 
-Neurofeedback is an experimental treatment that helped me. They hook you up to a bunch of wires to measure the frequency of different areas of your brain and play clicking noises to help retrain areas that are too fast or too slow. Whether or not it was placebo affect, the pre-and post- tests showed a lot of progress that I still feel a year or so later. 
-Please see a doctor if you haven’t already 
-I went to physical therapy. There is a PT clinic in my town that primarily serves the elderly population but they did all kinds of exercises to retrain my balance and memory and also taught me really important adaptive skills like asking people to repeat themselves and carrying a notebook with me to ensure I didn’t forget or get confused. 
-Take care of your mental health. See a therapist if you can.

Recovery will take work and you can’t do it alone. But it will happen. One day you will wake up and realize that xyz symptom isn’t really happening anymore."

The surgery allowed food to pass more easily but neither HM or POEM is a cure, it’s a crutch to make things more tolerable. I ate a liquid diet for probably four weeks after surgery and still have to revert back to liquid diet occasionally when I start to have symptoms. I still can’t eat late at night or eats lots of processed foods or fluffy breads or sugary candy. The difference between me before surgery and after surgery is that before, avoiding my triggers still resulted in horrible symptoms. Now, avoiding my triggers keeps me from having symptoms for weeks and sometimes months at a time. Sometimes I can sleep on my stomach, sometimes I can’t. I would suggest that you take a hard look at your habits and assess whether you’ve been gentle and patient with your body post-surgery. 

Now certainly you may be doing everything you’re supposed to be doing and still having symptoms. In that case, I’m sorry you’re still going through this."

wedding,flwebrt,t3_fqwu0c,1585547722.0,"My dad works in one of the hospitals leading the COVID 19 response in Tennessee. The infectious disease doctors he works with are absolutely not anticipating that it will peak in a week. Kentucky may be responding better than Tennessee, but I am assuming your guests are not all from Kentucky. At the very best, in the coming weeks we will learn if we flattened the curve in Tennessee/Kentucky- but a flattened curve will just mean a longer recovery. And say we do peak in the next couple weeks-if people immediately begin congregating in large groups it will most certainly cause a second wave of infections. I understand it’s a terrible thing to contemplate and I was dragging my feet before we postponed our June 6 wedding, but I was not willing to put the lives of my grandparents and other guests at risk.

nonprofit,flfi7vt,t3_foaz1q,1585107239.0,"This is kind of basic and applicable to any application process, but I’ve been on the hiring side and my biggest pet peeve is that people ignore or don’t read the full application instructions. You would be shocked how many qualified people just didn’t read the instructions and we eliminated from consideration. If the instructions say not to call or email to follow up or stipulate to use a certain subject line, believe the instructions. It may be different for different organizations, but showing up unannounced to the office has caused us to remove some people from consideration as well. Our staff is spread thin and we have confidentiality/security issues because of the clients we serve. At a small org, is likely that the hiring person will not reach out to you unless they want an interview. If you really want to reach out, reach out to someone in the department you want to work in and ask to get coffee or something. 

If you have a lack of employment or nonprofit specific job history, I highly recommend interning at an organization first to get your foot in the door. That’s how I got my first job and my short experience there landed me a better job elsewhere. We rarely hire someone without prior experience, and whenever we hire someone who has for-profit experience but no non-profit experience it hasn’t worked out super well for us."

Leaving a controlling partner is the most dangerous time. Depending on how bad it is, you can get a police escort while you get your belongings and if he follows you to your place of work or new home, seek help from authorities/lawyer to obtain an order of protection. We probably aren’t in the same state, but if this applies to you dm me if you want a referral to legal services in your area. I’m not a lawyer but I work with lawyers who obtain orders of protection.

Some objective and candid advice- Saying I’m the worst and I’m pathetic is the same kind of egotistical thinking that leads people to think they are the best when they are not. Perhaps it might be freeing and/or comforting to consider that you aren’t the worst or the best, you’re probably just a mediocre but decent person trying to make it just like the rest of us, and like the rest of us, your job hunt might take some time and unfair turns.
