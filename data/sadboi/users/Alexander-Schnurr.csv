SuicideWatch,fnumb70,t3_g3sz2y,1587265518.0,None of this is your fault we are all in this together. The whole world is with you. I speak for all of Canada when I say this. I promise you once we are done with our PPE Canada will not stop helping other countries especially the United States. We won’t stop producing PPE until this war is over. We will continue to send PPE to United States and other countries around the world. We are staying home and physically distancing to make sure we stop covid-19 so less people get sick and less people die. Relief will come. You are saving lives and you are our heroes. Here is what I think just do your best because that’s all we can do right now. Don’t worry about anything else but doing your best. Save as many as you can but most importantly take care of yourself first. As Justin Trudeau said “we are here for you”. What he says is true even though you are with the worst possible man at the presidential office that isn’t doing enough for you or anyone in the USA. If I were president I’d make sure people like you our hero’s get what they need first before anyone else. Never give up you are our only hope. I understand how you feel regarding the girlfriend thing my girlfriend did the same thing to me. I am going crazy not being able to see my friends but it’s worth it if it means I can make a difference and save lives. There is light at the end of the tunnel.
