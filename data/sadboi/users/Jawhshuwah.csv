Alternatively 5x is an option but I've never tried it and don't want to give any false information.

This is not really an experience you can properly prepare for because it's more a unconcious and internal experience that's somewhat random, just make sure you have either a trip sitter or somewhere to put the smoking vessel or you will forget about it and potentially break it.

My gripe is with people posting unrelated memes or artwork for the sole purpose of farming Karma. So many people have took it upon themselves to post lazy edits of images and post it on every single drug subreddit, absolutely nothing to Salvia or Salvia experiences, sometimes not even with drugs in general.

I don't think it's too demanding to want to keep this subreddit on track rather than it being an unrelated art dumping ground.

 I personally leave W at 1 until I have to upgrade it, but I'm constantly pushing for pressure and W is the best way to not get killed by ganks
I max E second because if someone hourglasses I can just lay the E under them and help my team, it also is good for protecting yourself from melee champs and in teamfights because nobody is looking on the ground at all, it can also be used to deter people from coming for drag because the mines take up literally the whole walkway in most parts or the jg.
Always check timers before ults, you don't want to use it to push a lane or kill one person if drag or baron is coming up, your ult turns 50/50 drag fights into 75/25, just make sure you ping your ult because it does fuck up your jungler's smite timing if an unexpected ziggs ult hits an objective.

I personanlly play with tp, it's so good early game for getting a cs lead to dominate your lane or late game you can teleport and take towers easily. You should never be close enough to ignite or you're not playing him to his full ranged potential.

I don't know much about Ziggs bot, I only play him mid, but any support like swain, tresh, janna, blitz, naut, basically anyone with a hook or pull or cc is really bad for ziggs, you only have one escape and it doesn't bring you very far, there could be some good matchups I guess, but if you're solo queing it's probably best not to play him bot too much. If they have assassin jg or mid, bot is literally unplayable as ziggs."

When you chew and spit it, the taste is the worst negative, but wrapping it in 2 or 3 pieces of gum completely takes away taste while producing more saliva to absorb the LSA.

I find consuming such a low amount of seeds, especially using something where you're not consuming any seed matter itself besides LSA feels a whole lot different than when consuming plant matter.

When you say you made brownies, did you heat up the LSA at all? Heat destroys LSA so whatever alkaloids that aren't killed by heat were probably present instead, but it shouldn't have effected the strength of the trip...
