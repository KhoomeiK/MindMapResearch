ptsd,fjrjanm,t3_feskgv,1583586211.0,"There are multiple things in your post that are well-known causes of trauma (e.g. PTSD or CPTSD). Trauma can also come from watching abuse happening to other people (especially loved ones) that didn't involve you physically getting hurt. And lots more things qualify as forms of abuse than beatings - even neglect, emotional abuse, and things that weren't intentional. Many people don't know enough about trauma or abuse and think they're limited to war or beatings, which isn't true. Unfortunately this also includes those who should know better, like doctors and crappy therapists, so many people out there might be dismissive and try to convince you otherwise.  

There's a test out there about adverse childhood experiences (ACE) that you can look up (Edit: here's a [link](https://acestoohigh.com/got-your-ace-score/)) to see some of the kinds of things that can really mess kids up for the long-term, if any of that rings bells for you, so you can know those things are unhealthy for kids to grow up with and can cause issues (these aren't the only things though!). CPTSD is another term some people aren't aware of which is a form of PTSD that can happen with people exposed to trauma over a long period of time such as all of childhood. You can try poking around in r/cptsd or on Google if that rings any bells either. Good luck, and sorry you had to deal with that."

I'm still looking for the right meds that show some sort of benefit instead of all downsides :( The only one so far that has offered a slight benefit without horrible side effects is methylphenidate (Ritalin), and it's still not all *that* huge of an improvement over just taking caffeine instead.

If I'm clicking it out of habit, the fact it's missing will sometimes stop me long enough to remember why I moved it away. If I actually needed it for something, I'll go find it on page 2 or wherever I moved it this time.

DecidingToBeBetter,fij61bv,t3_f7yy9r,1582435574.0,"I think everything has been said by now, so I can only add this sentiment (validatation of meta-feelings): it's normal to cry sometimes, but I think it's also normal to feel embarrassed or vulnerable about crying unexpectedly in front of other people, and that's *also* okay.  

Crappy comparison incoming, but kind of like saying ""you too"" to the person in the ticket booth telling you to enjoy your movie. It's normal to accidentally say that, and it's also normal to feel embarrassed about that.  

It feels crappy but stuff happens sometimes. Maybe you might be able to ""get better"" about some or all of the following: being happier and not crying as much, not being as ashamed of crying, releasing emotions without them flooding out, etc. and that would obviously be great, but it's also ok to acknowledge that you had some unexpected feelings and felt crappy and it just kinda sucked, and sometimes you just have a bad day and we all have those sometimes. If you get what I'm saying.  

P.S. sometimes therapy or just generally healing from stuff brings up strong emotions unexpectedly and that's really common. e.g. lots of people with trauma or abuse go kind of ""numb"" for years to survive their personal hellhole, and they actually start getting worse flashbacks and emotional breakdowns when they get out of the traumatic environment because the body finally feels safe to start unpacking all that.

1. Dehydration - I was so horrible at taking care of myself that I would not only be under-hydrated all the time but not even realize it. (Mega out of tune with my body!) Sometimes after pulling an all-nighter on some project or something I'd feel weak and know I needed food, but nothing in the house felt edible in those moments except things like soup or applesauce. It took me a while to make the connection that I was craving wet foods because I needed water. Hopefully your appetite isn't being messed with by a lack of water or other deficiencies and making it harder?  

2. Anxiety - two things here: anxiety can wreck your appetite in itself, but also anxiety in general can get you in a catch-22 that just perpetuates itself.

I’m also an artist that used to give out too many handmade things until I just couldn’t do it anymore, or I misjudge how many hours a project takes vs. what’s appropriate to “spend” on someone as a gift."
selfhelp,ep2pswp,t1_ep21rst,1559011334.0,"I had the same experience with Pokémon when I was younger. I never stopped liking it, but around middle school it suddenly became “uncool” for no good reason and I had to hide my hobby from kids who thought they were too cool for school and would pick on me. By the time we got to college it suddenly became very cool again.  

I think the commenter above nailed it. Teenagers are too focused on distancing themselves from their childhood, or something, and push away things for the sake of appearances. When you’re an adult, though, no one cares anymore, and nostalgia becomes appealing again.  

As someone who was in college when Minecraft came out, it never had elements of “cool” or “uncool” spiking and plummeting like it seems to have with your age group. It was just a fun game. My friends and I would play it for a while and forget about it and pick it back up again later. Just like any other hobby.  

Both Pokémon and Minecraft are extremely successful and long-running game franchises, so objectively there’s nothing weird about liking them. Young people just go through phases, and I feel for you, because it sucked for me too when everyone decided perfectly good things were “uncool” all of a sudden."

She started to apologize for being a nightmare at the previous event, but when I asked, oh, you mean [her blowing up on me]? she snapped at me and told me she’d never be sorry for that—I should be sorry! The actual thing she was “apologizing” for was for not drowning her nerves in enough booze that weekend to put on a happier face.  

(Then she did a bunch of other bitchy shit and I cut her out of my life, the end)"
CPTSD,eo9foxb,t1_eo8rws5,1558390290.0,"You know, you reminded me that I used to spend a lot of time at recess at the fringes of the playground near the woods as well. My first school was a shitty tiny strict private church school with one-room classrooms and an equally tiny and sad excuse for a playground. I remember digging in a hollowed stump with a stick in the middle of the muddy playground and us kids making a break for it to the apple trees at the end of a nearby field. When I moved schools, I spent many a recess collecting caterpillars under the big tree. One time a bully (not the first and definitely not the last) ripped one out of my hands yelling mean things and spiked it into the dirt. My only friend from the old school abandoned me to kiss up to a clique that didn’t like me. So I played alone away from the other kids I didn’t fit in with at the edges of the playground, as a misfit at the fringes of kid society, jumping through tree portals to the fairy dimension and communing with the forest spirits. I had a pretty lonely childhood but I still smile when I see those caterpillars. Their little eyespots going down their bodies are like the familiar face of an old friend I didn’t have back then..."
