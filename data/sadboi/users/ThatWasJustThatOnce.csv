WayOfTheBern,fj8gmzz,t3_fc2lrh,1583112949.0,"These stats, if true, are so strange. I suppose it means he was an effective campaigner, as his pitch was about inclusivity and diversity of opinion, but with a distaste for political extremes. He seems to have successfully captured a significant number of voters who found themselves appreciating at least some of the ideas of each candidate, but not liking what any individual candidate represented as a whole.

This also could evidence Pete‚Äôs notorious opportunism, as this strategy is an obvious way to manipulate such a crowded field of candidates. He somehow managed to identify the center amidst everyone running, and played to it hard.

The Pete phenomenon itself was also strange. People who follow the money, as well as those who follow the intelligence community, are all wondering where exactly Pete emerged. The gay, Harvard educated, veteran, former midwestern working class town mayor, is a suspiciously well crafted individual for a 2020 Presidential bid, and also correlates to that liminal space in American politics that he was appealing to.

Lastly, the timing is strange. With all the money he has spent, and with his donors‚Äô clear intent to at least steal delegates from Sanders, it‚Äôs surprising that he is dropping out two days before Super Tuesday. One would think he would at least want to see how he did. 

I‚Äôm inclined to believe somebody dug up some real dirt on him, and that he was then either cancelled by a donor who didn‚Äôt want the association, or blackmailed.

Pete Buttigieg. Strange."

Parenting,euc15b6,t3_cfqhwg,1563662220.0,"Congratulations, and welcome to the club! My partner and I decided to eliminate TV for our 3.5-year-old back in March. The progress was almost  immediate and kind of jaw-dropping. We had been trying to potty train him for a year at that point.  After the TV was gone, he was fully potty trained in less than 30 days. Also in that month, for the first time, we started getting eye contact and acknowledgement of understanding from him when discussing his bad behaviors. He stopped hitting other children at daycare, which is why we took the TV away in the first place. We‚Äôve never looked back.

Zero screen time may seem like an extreme approach to parenting these days, but I think it‚Äôs totally appropriate for developing minds. Observe the effect TV has on your children. Sure, it‚Äôs not a chemical drug, but it is still nonetheless a highly addictive sedative, complete with symptoms of withdrawal. I‚Äôm gonna pass on giving that to my children."
