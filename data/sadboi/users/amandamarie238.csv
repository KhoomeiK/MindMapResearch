KeepWriting,fj79gqn,t1_fj72j1k,1583088444.0,"I never said this was a poem, in fact I agree it‚Äôs just prose. As much as I appreciate it I didn‚Äôt post this looking for feedback and I think I made it pretty obvious I don‚Äôt think this is anything special. I have so much to improve on when it comes to my writing and I‚Äôm well aware of that. However, I disagree with you when it comes to poetry. Poetry is about emotions and it should be emotional, otherwise what‚Äôs the point? It‚Äôs also perfectly okay to write poetry about yourself and your feelings as long as you write from a place of truth. I‚Äôve read poems that have saved my life even though the writer was talking about their own experiences and feelings. I don‚Äôt want to write to sound pretty or super intellectual. I also don‚Äôt write to gain fame or praise for doing the bare minimum. I want to write to help people and that‚Äôs all there is to it."

It‚Äôs a fucking gut punch seeing old friends being so social and thriving when none of them even care about me anymore. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm happy for them and will always wish them well. It just hurts a bit too much.

DepressionRecovery,fcrpaf6,t3_eijzb7,1577904797.0,"I recommend volunteering somewhere. Last year I volunteered at my local humane society and I think it did so much good.

Other things I can recommend are journaling, making collages, or even reading more books could be a great use of your time. 

I hope you find something you enjoy and I wish you the best of luck. Happy New Year! Sending you lots of love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
