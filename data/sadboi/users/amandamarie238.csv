KeepWriting,fjajy27,t1_fjaj8bv,1583174991.0,"Yeah I’ve been hurt, I first started writing this in high school after my first big heart break. I needed to escape and write something to heal. You know how watching a romcom makes you feel? Even though they’re cheesy and unrealistic they can help you feel better on a bad day. That’s what writing this was like and that’s what I was going for."
KeepWriting,fjaiqyj,t1_fjagmze,1583174328.0,Ah shit I swear to god I should’ve proofread this more thoroughly lol thank you

KeepWriting,fj7vzbd,t1_fj7lohu,1583099491.0,Thank you so so much this is great feedback. I wish others could comprehend you can criticize someone’s work without being condescending. I will take your advice and use it in whatever I write in the future. Again thank you ❤️
KeepWriting,fj79gqn,t1_fj72j1k,1583088444.0,"I never said this was a poem, in fact I agree it’s just prose. As much as I appreciate it I didn’t post this looking for feedback and I think I made it pretty obvious I don’t think this is anything special. I have so much to improve on when it comes to my writing and I’m well aware of that. However, I disagree with you when it comes to poetry. Poetry is about emotions and it should be emotional, otherwise what’s the point? It’s also perfectly okay to write poetry about yourself and your feelings as long as you write from a place of truth. I’ve read poems that have saved my life even though the writer was talking about their own experiences and feelings. I don’t want to write to sound pretty or super intellectual. I also don’t write to gain fame or praise for doing the bare minimum. I want to write to help people and that’s all there is to it."
depression,fj03b7j,t3_fajhs4,1582887144.0,I’m about ready to delete Instagram for all the reasons you said. I’ve gotten rid of it multiple times before but my dumb ass keeps making a new one. It’s a fucking gut punch seeing old friends being so social and thriving when none of them even care about me anymore. Don’t get me wrong I’m happy for them and will always wish them well. It just hurts a bit too much.

DepressionRecovery,fcrpaf6,t3_eijzb7,1577904797.0,"I recommend volunteering somewhere. Last year I volunteered at my local humane society and I think it did so much good. It got me out of the house and I got to take care of cats, and even though social interaction was minimal it got me around people too. 

Other things I can recommend are journaling, making collages, or even reading more books could be a great use of your time. 

I hope you find something you enjoy and I wish you the best of luck. Happy New Year! Sending you lots of love ❤️"

I’m feeling really down again. Tbh idk if meds are worth it, just depends on the person."
