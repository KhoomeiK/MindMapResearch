BPD,fpcfhke,t1_fonax8t,1588498620.0,"I’ve been really trying to think of a good answer, but the truth is that this is something I still really struggle with. Here’s what I know helps somewhat- I try to just acknowledge that that’s how I’m feeling firstly, accept the feeling and any thoughts I might have about accepting it, watch the feeling as an observer and don’t react to it, watch it rise and fall until it goes away. I know that helps, but in all honesty I don’t always do what helps. Actually doing this is the moment of feeling abandoned is the hardest part. If you’re actively feeling abandoned and you have bpd that’s probably one of your biggest triggers and sometimes there’s this reckless self-destructive feeling like ‘fuck it’ and I go with my dysfunctional conditioned response. Other times I really consciously override that, which can be fucking hard, and very deliberately go through the steps I’ve outlined. I don’t immediately feel better but at least I can say I haven’t made things worse by acting out how I feel."
BorderlinePDisorder,fp365us,t1_fp1zowx,1588273769.0,"Wow, I really relate to what you’ve written here. I also grew up thinking that I was supposed to be ‘important’ and gave up on playing piano in my teens because I wasn’t The Best at it and didn’t think I was good enough. I’m learning now that it’s okay to be average! I don’t have to be the best or worst person alive, I just am. 
I started learning a new instrument recently because I remembered how much I used to love playing music when I wasn’t getting bogged down with other people’s (but mostly my own) expectations. It’s nice to just play for the simple joy of it."
BorderlinePDisorder,fowkco7,t1_fotk9vv,1588121476.0,"I don’t know you or what you want to run from but I do know that you don’t have to go anywhere to start getting in touch with the things you really want and need. It’s weird being borderline sometimes because we can be so impulsive about our wants and whims, but aren’t often touch with the things that would be good for us. I’ve spent a lot of time always trying to be or do what I think other people want and I’m only now even realising it and trying to actually do something for myself. Even if it’s only in a small way right now, it feels good. Still, I wish I didn’t dwell so much on the romanticised vision in my head of running away and being alone in the woods with 3 cats and absolutely no people, because where I am now, learning to stay when I want to run, learning to make it work where I’ve always given up, is where I need to grow the most. Maybe that’s just me idk. 
What would be good for you?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fosg49y,t3_g950xu,1588030039.0,I’ve done it a couple of times and my problems followed me each time. I can fool myself for a while that I can start over and be someone totally new but I’m still me and eventually I get sick of being treated like the person I’ve pretended to be and run again. I’ve been thinking about it recently and talked it over with a friend going through the same urge instead of doing it. First step to changing something is recognising it so good job there.

BPD,fomlnkg,t3_g856o2,1587894727.0,"I have this too. My theory is that because people with BPD are constantly in their heads they don’t pay enough attention in the moment. Paying attention is step 1 to creating a memory. If you’re obsessing about your FP abandoning you instead of listening to them talk, for instance, you’re less likely to remember the conversation. Also I’m pretty sure trauma can cause memory problems too, which most of us have."
