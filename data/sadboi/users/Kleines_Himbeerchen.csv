killingfloor,fn2um2z,t3_fyxf7a,1586603945.0,"Well the difference is:
KF2 is mainly action focussed and has a bit more RNG to force players out of comfort zones, while at the same time offering many skills and gimmicks to handle most situations. Taking damage is part of this gameplay.

KF1 was mainly strategic focussed, it was all about finding a good spot, balance your team, execute plans, aim at the zeds weak spots and killing the right zeds with the right perks. It was all about avoiding damage and the medic was more like a last line.

A successful play on KF1 felt more rewarding because you knew you and your team executed plans well and applied great game and map knowledge. On the other hand, KF2 matches are more engaging and offer more variation and more viable perk compositions. And most casual players prefer the latter approach to gameplay. Its a sad truth that we live at a time, where shooters like Overwatch and CoD dominate the design of FPS games while more strategic, ""non-chaotic"" games like CS:GO may be popular within competitive play, but not so much with the casual playerbase. A quick look at popular Twitch games shows exactly what i mean.

Its all about being quick and flashy. Slow and rewarding gameplay became more of a niche, just look at the RTS genre that is basically completely gone from the mainstream market."

We live it a time where tolerating alternative lifestyles (like being gay, trans etc) are becoming more accepted - but people who are choosing to live alone (no matter if they are casual dating or not) are still somehow looked down at. Some narrow minded individuals even judge this choice as some personal or mental issue."
LivingAlone,fio6nt8,t3_f8pjjp,1582577331.0,"To be fair, many marriages fail because people marry for the wrong reasons. Social pressure, biological clock, or because they simply don't know who they are so they hope they find the answer to that in another person. If the marriage itself (and not the other person) is the main motivation to marry, you can be almost completely sure it will fail.

Don't let others decide your lifestyle. If you are happy living alone, just ignore all those ""buT yOu cAnt Be hApPy alOne""-calls. You are the only one who can tell you how to be happy. No culture, religion, social norm, family speech or media agenda can.

Btw, if you still struggle about your choice: Maybe short-term relationships are a thing for you. This option is often overlooked and most people go the all-or-nothing-way. But i have to say almost all of my good relationship experiences come from those. Just a short time spending together, a little bit crushing but no deep feelings and no long term promises. Creating a nice memory and moving on. No one is getting hurt either and big questions that can ruin long-term-relationships (like ""you you want children?"", ""what is your political view?"" or ""are you religious?"" and stuff) won't even come up. No jealousy, no drama. 

This is obviously not for everyone (tbh, its hard finding women wanting those) but they can be a nice 3rd option besides the extremes ""living alone"" or ""marry""."

No, the market still exists, the demand still exists, the price is just (obviously) too high.

""Also, when a monopoly exists, the supply/demand concept doesn't exactly apply.""

Yes it does, its just abused to the max.

And your example is just the definition of demand & supply price shaping. But at the end its still demand & supply. Monopolies are part of the system. And thats why in real life, in most countries the markets are regulated to prevent exactly that, because supply & demand CAN lead to monopolies and therefore they are part of it."

You said its no supply and demand and yet you (rightfully) say, that those items aren't vital and therefore will sit unpurchased.

But then supply and demand works. Because if no one is buying those items for that price, and they actually wanna sell their stuff and not just sit on it forever, they eventuell will have to lower the price. Therefore supply and demand still shapes the price."
