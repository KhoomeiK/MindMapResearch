Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” 25 “Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!” 26 The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. 27 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this?

Christianity,f9npy0s,t3_e63o2c,1575488725.0,"I'm sure there are points here that can be disputed, but I figured I might as well share my beliefs.

I've always been a very skeptical person, so instead of trying to prove myself right on issues, I try to prove myself wrong so I can find the 'truth' of the matter. 


These are some of the things that make be believe in the Bible:


* The Bible was written over a period of roughly 1,500 years by several different authors, but instead of being this chopped-up, contradictory story, the whole Bible follows a central theme: redemption for man, and a battle to prove whether God's reign is the right way or not (in short, the sanctification of Gods name and kingdom.) The book doesn't contradict itself, even though obvious doctrinal changes were made between the Old and New Testaments. The Bible is self-referential and carries a sense of relative uniformity throughout the book.

* Second, I believe the Bible is real simply because it still exists today. The original manuscripts of the Bible are ancient, and several forces throughout man's history have worked to get rid of all of it, but it still survives to this day. The Bible is the John Wick of books, in the sense that nothing has been able to ""take it down."" 

* Several historical events have been described throughout the Bible that correlate with actual historical events down to the last detail. As an example, the book of Daniel, a prophetic book that foretold the fall of Babylon, was so accurate in historical details that many scholars refused to believe the book was written  before the events. They insisted the only way it could have that kind of accuracy was if it was written afterwards, but the original manuscripts and references thereto pre-dated the fall of the Babylonian empire. There are several other examples of this in the Bible, but this one is my personal favorite.

* The last point I'll share today is that out of all the different translations available of the Bible, even though certain words or passages differ slightly, the core message of the Bible has never changed. Have you ever played the ""telephone game""? If you haven't, basically, in a group of people, one person will whisper a random sentence into another person's ear. That person whispers it to the next person, and so on, until it gets to the last person. If the last person repeats the original sentence at the end, you ""win"", sort of. A lot of times, though, when the last person says it back, the sentence has changed, because someone in the chain misheard the previous person. The Bible is ancient, and many, many people have worked to translate and make it available in common languages. If it were up to humans alone to make sure it was translated correctly, it would seem that each translation of the Bible would be different enough to poke different holes in its contents across translations. The fact that the message of the Bible remains unchanged is a sign, to me, that the book is of God's doing, and not man's alone.


That's all I have for today."

I was lucky enough to find a really good therapist, and she was actually the one who gave me the diagnosis. She was extremely thorough, researching and working with colleagues (with my permission) to discuss what could be happening in my brain. 


One of my first questions to her after the diagnosis was a lot like yours. I *knew* what I was experiencing was not normal, and I had moments of clarity in the middle of some delusions where I could see that something was wrong. 


I brought this up as a concern, thinking that maybe this was another incorrect diagnosis, or that I was somehow faking it (weird thought, I know.) She replied saying that schizophrenia has a huge spectrum, ranging from relatively ""high-functioning"" to extremely severe schizophrenia. 


Having awareness of your condition doesn't make it 'not real'; it just means your mind is somewhere else on the spectrum than the fully severe side.


Remember, you spoke with a med student - while there's no reason to believe she's not an intelligent person, she is probably more likely to see things in textbook terms rather than real-life application. She will need to learn that not everyone with the same condition reacts the same way.


Please don't let her shake your baseline for reality. If possible, request to speak with a more senior medical professional, and explain again why you cannot return to SSRIs.
