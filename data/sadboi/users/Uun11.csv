Thats why im happy for internet providing such easy way to connect, and with time you can find true friends trough there, maybe ones that last for a lifetime.

Its not ridiculous that someone would love you, but its way easier if you give yourself little room to breathe, and dont just smash yourself at every opportunity. You might fail, you might feel like you cant do something, but its ok. Even if you feel like shit, its ok to be tired.

We keep in touch almost daily currently, playing games, talking about stuff thats happening, what ever comes to mind.

Maybe you could try looking for people to talk online too? You must have something you are interested in, look for places that people talk about it, look how people react there and how they write, then when you have the courage, write something there yourself.

For me it was just way of letting my anger go. And i was really angry at myself at that time, and when i failed at something, be it at game, at school, at home with chore, i would release the anger by hitting something. And because i was so angry at myself for being so ""bad"" or ""failing all the time"" i did it to myself, so i would learn not to do it again.

Now, i have been trying to be more forgiving to myself. Also have cut all violent ways of releasing my feelings. I sometimes still might get the urge to hurt myself, but it has been helping me to think i am just a human after all.

I think if it was someone else failing there, i would forgive them, not be mad but supportive and want to help them trough it. I think this was also how i started getting better mentally.

Got home, played with friends a little, got to be there for one of them when they were feeling down too. Maybe one day i will be brave enough to message them when i am feeling really down.

OverwatchUniversity,eti6f63,t1_eti4rsg,1562840460.0,"I can proof read it once i get home later tonight. And best way to improve is by doing, dont want to discourage you from writing stuff like this in the future."
OverwatchUniversity,eti4a1a,t3_cbtd17,1562838238.0,"Nice tips and tricks. You repeat things here and there, and i can tell from little typos that english is not your native language. Might want to proof read it to make it easier to understand.
But good that you have found success with Zen.
Embrace tranquility!"
Overwatch,etf3k7q,t1_eteugxl,1562758851.0,"I mean, you give much praise, but the hog just missed the hook while she was flying to orisas body. If the hog was good, he would have hooked her and probably got the kill, considering its diamond.

Hiding from EMP, 5/5. I think if the sombra was smart, she could have gotten her in the EMP too, but thats just crossing hairs. Everything else, looks good.

Climbing as solo healer is hard, even if you make the perfect plays, you still rely on your team to carry you over the finish line."

Those stats look pretty good though, gz"
socialskills,esigfe6,t1_eshvisv,1562013238.0,"I would think it means, going out, meeting people? Get a hobby, go to conventions that have something you are interested in, join online forums? The world is full of people, you just have to reach out and find them."
depression,es253lm,t3_c5di4y,1561514131.0,"I know i have this problem. That being the person having such a good time or hard time, you feel like you should be able to carry your own problems, instead trying to share the burden with other person.

I have few friends that might be there to listen to me, but i have so hard time reaching out. Also my insecure nature draws too many conclusions and if i am having a episode, i feel so alone and that i am just a burden for my friends.

It makes you think if just being alone would be easier than thinking if your friends are truly there for you, even if that is only in my head."
depression,es24rfo,t1_es1m1sa,1561513875.0,"This is why i am afraid of reaching out to my friends or family about my mental problems. I am afraid the reaction might be negative instead of supportive, and rather fight a losing battle alone.

Sometimes you just wish a friend who knows you have mental health problems would reach out and ask how you are doing..

Also, your boyfriend does not deserve you if he cant support you trough your bad times."
ShitPostCrusaders,es24fvt,t1_es236x3,1561513626.0,"I will have to agree with this. While these hotlines have people to talk to, talking to a stranger is totally different than having a friend or family member reach out.

Having been following few subreddits about mental health, sometimes these hotlines might take action that could worsen the state the person is in. I have read that they could call police and depending on your location it might cost you a fortune and few weeks in institution.

If you feel like you have a friend or family member having mental problems, ask them how they are doing, reach out, before its too late."

Only reason i am not playing SSF is because i have few friends to play with sometimes."

dbz,erqz6oo,t1_ermfvz0,1561155844.0,"The Golden Frieza fight should have ended with Vegeta giving the final blow IMO. I dont mind the whole timetravel thing, but not have him finish it with Gokus warning.

Also the episode where he travels to get Trunks and Goten from the other planet, i felt it could have been done with Vegeta and boys taking care of the problem, but that would have needed little changes to the things powers.

Those two i can remember now."
depression,ermlo89,t3_c2u9y5,1561028954.0,"You are just taking few commenta little too seriously. People here have been hearing the same phrases over and over again. It may be true, but some people see it like you would be rubbing it to their faces by claiming that they will feel fine one day.
Truth is it takes work and time. Loads of both. And sometimes the work load just feels too much. I spend last week laying on bed, could not get up and even shower. If someone would have said to me that its gonna be ok, i would have told them to get out of my face, even if i knew it will.
Also you have had loads of positive comments, dont concentrate on the negative, think of the positive sides."
dbz,erlkyp4,t3_c2o0qp,1560989974.0,"The very thing i love about Vegeta and why he is my favorite character in the series, is his willpower. I loved the majin Vegeta and the sacrifice he made had me in tears. Wish Vegeta had his moment in the spotlight, in super there was few occasions i felt like they could have given Vegeta a few wins without Goku or companions."
socialskills,epz98vy,t3_bwo0m8,1559661067.0,"I mean, i struggle with the same thing. Best advice i can give you is to just ignore it. When you feel like you are being isolated or you feel like you are being left out, i just think that if they did not want me around, they would probably say something. If these people are not toxic towards you, and still invite you along i would suggest that you just try to be you.

If they like you as a good friend, it will evolve with time. Good friendships dont just start out of nowhere, you have to get to know each other. Just be yourself and see how it goes."
depression,epw8xkp,t3_bwaf4c,1559569459.0,"You can feel like that, but still care about the people having the problem.
People have differend issues that cause anxiety or other problems. For you it seems small and insignificant, but for them its real. 
My social anxiety fucks me up and i cant keep a job. I have no reason on my mind to be like this. I feel my problem is so small compared to orhers that i have no reason to complain. So i endure everything in silence. And because of that i feel like my lifes just falling apart slowly.
Some days i cant even talk to my friends because of it."
depression,epvzob7,t3_bw8e1q,1559560012.0,"Maybe he has his own problems, that caused him to block you.
 I have nice online community which has people in it that care about me, but i feel like i am just dragging them down with my self pity and bad mood, that multiple days i just ignore all the messages and think it would be better to just leave.
People are mysterious."
depression,epvz9d5,t3_bw8hht,1559559458.0,"My dog used to be the only thing that got me out of the house. After she passed few months back i feel like i have no reasons to go out.
We got new dog, but i have hard time trying to bond with it, and currently its really shy and is afraid of new people (we got it because old owner could not take care of it)
Our old dog saved me, but i feel like im dragging myself back to the same hole."
depression,epsz9ts,t1_epshb4k,1559475170.0,"Happened to me yesterday, was watching csgo stream, was waiting for few of my friends come online so we can go play some games, then suddenly start to feel like shit out of nowhere, had really hard time even joining them, and felt like could not speak at all. We took a break and after it took me like hour of mentally preparing to join them again.. But still couldnt speak. Its like there is something preventing voice leaving my throat."
depression,epjte80,t3_buxxei,1559260107.0,"I believe there are many of us out there, who feel alone and sad, but keep the face of happiness to not worry others. My friends tell me i am social, fun and nice person to hangout with, but when i am alone with myself, i feel real bad. Everything thats going wrong, thats my fault in my head by default. I usually cry more than i smile if i am alone. While i dont actually think of killing myself, i have many times thought how much easier would be if i would just cease existing. For my family everyone around me. Which is stupid.

These days i just enjoy gaming with few friends i have made online that i know when i am in my ""right mind"" care about me and want to be with me. But when its bad, i feel like everyones just pretending to be my friend either because they want something from me or feel bad for me. This also leads to me feeling like i need to be good at the games we play, so i am not a burden for them.

Lately have been getting better, usually just trying to convince myself that if they did not want me around, they would not ask me to play, and trying to treat them like i would like to be treated. It has made talking with people easier. I think my family members know i am not well, at least. Do they know how bad i feel? Probably not, i have been thinking of talking about it, but it feels so hard to say.

This became more a rant about my life. But i hope you can get trough this and get better. I still believe there can be better tomorrow waiting for people like us. Even if it feels hard to believe."
depression,epba8vz,t1_epb9r63,1559139891.0,"Tried, for how long? You have to understand its not just gonna happen immediately. You have to keep on trying. Just because you dont like you, doesnt mean some girl wont. You are just not your type."
dbz,epb7uoj,t3_bud4gz,1559138945.0,"Overall, i think Super was great. I liked the animation, the story was pretty good. Only bad thing was that the Tournament of Power never felt really ""serious"" fight for the universe. Mostly because we had characters not going full strength and just played around half of the tournament. 

Only time i felt they got serious was in the end against Jiren in the end. Might have been that they were saving power, but i felt many fights could have been ended in seconds, but went on for longer than needed."
depression,epb6h2d,t3_buehau,1559138393.0,"I dont know how you have been acting lately, but have they been asking you before that a lot to do things that you have dismissed? He might thought you are just not interested and did not want to bother you. Hes still a human being too, just like you, with his own flaws and insecurities.

One thing i have noticed is, that i always expect people to reach out to me, and when they do not, i am let down because nobody seems to care about me. But truth is that nobody can read minds."
