Sei que sou muito privilegiado por isso. Queria poder te enviar um abraço virtual e te desejar que muitas pessoas no seu caminho possam ser para você a família que infelizmente seus pais não estão sendo no momento."

Só não associa o que essas pessoas fizeram à feminismo ou movimento LGBT, porque nenhum indivíduo é ""representante"" ou ""responde"" por essas ideias ou lutas, portanto a atitude delas é responsabilidade individual delas e não do que essas coisas representam. 

É a falácia da hipocrisia. Alguém ser hipócrita não anula a validade da ideia por associação. 

Mas sei que sua intenção não foi essa! O comentário é mais para outras pessoas que talvez venham comentar com essa intenção"

brasil,fj2fhuh,t1_fj260ec,1582942344.0,Quando vi seu link fiquei torcendo muito que fosse o vídeo da Natalie do ContraPoints. Minha satisfação de ver mais fãs dela aparecendo no Brasil a cada dia
digimon,fixi9ui,t3_fa9ud4,1582820870.0,He looks very well made! Congrats
askgaybros,fiky99x,t3_f8a13y,1582489618.0,That's so wholesome. Weekly beer and horror movies sounds awesome. Congratulations!
askgaybros,fihuh7c,t1_fieimug,1582414262.0,"I don't get it too. Before going out I look myself in the mirror and I'm like: ""that's a good looking guy"" but then I go through a mall or elevator mirror and my confidence is non existent for the rest of the week. Recently I'm dealing with a lot of insecurity about my nose. I can't stand looking myself in profile and I'm already considering plastic surgery at this point. As Natalie from Contraptions once said: ""it's hard to be a 6"""

Anxiety,fcuwcpk,t3_ej1vfr,1577989865.0,"I know this feeling so well... When I was 18, 20 or even 22 I always justified my current situation as a consequence of me being too young or immature. Now that I'm 24, I get myself worrying about all the things I think I should be able to do, but I still can't (like driving or having a serious relationship with someone). I also feel as I didn't enjoy my early twenties as I should - what fills me with regret. The next presidential election in my country will also happen in 3 years, maybe we are from the same place. I seems so far but I know it will get very soon."
brasil,fc2xpa3,t3_efvjaf,1577376802.0,Ficou muito bom!! Fiquei curioso de ver outros pontos turísticos de BH.
Anxiety,f9i0h6g,t3_e56h1a,1575325396.0,It's funny how much anxiety comes with a lingering feeling of anger. I'm being so hateful recently and I wasn't like that years ago. Socializing just makes everything worse.
Anxiety,f9i069a,t3_e4wlxb,1575325217.0,I can relate so much
Anxiety,f9i01th,t3_e4stkz,1575325146.0,Congratulations!!! I haven't driven for 4 years now due to my anxiety and I just can't wait to get back at it. Not driving limits my life so much... I'm so glad you took this opportunity and nailed it!
askgaybros,f92ujef,t1_f927yle,1575042147.0,I'm 24 and never had a boyfriend as well. I'm still struggling... Hope I get this level of peace and self confidence that OP has

depression,f8581ps,t3_dz31f4,1574269615.0,"Yeah, I feel this way a lot. People always say I am a nice person, but that's all... just... nice. Nothing remarkable or special. No one really loves me. No one would really miss me that much. It's almost like I don't have something that resembles a personality. If I wasn't so afraid of confrontation, I think I rather be hated than only ""liked"" by people. I don't know... I'm saying this while I spend lunch time by myself at work since none of my friends really cared that much when I said I didn't want to have lunch today."
depression,f857f1e,t3_dyyvj7,1574269227.0,I feel so sorry for you. My best friend is my brother as well and I can only imagine how horrible it would be to have him in this condition. I hope some miracle happens and things turn out well at the end. I wish I could offer more than just my words... Good luck

askgaybros,f4ybzsg,t1_f4vve7c,1571874478.0,I can relate a lot with this. I always think to myself why I'm working so hard if the reward is so mediocre. It would feel nice to have someone to share some of my accomplishments.

Anxiety,f1iojze,t3_d9l3r9,1569513060.0,Me too. I just want someone to help me through the rough times. Someone to hold so I know what's real and what is not. It's so lonely to be this vulnerable all the time without someone by your side.
