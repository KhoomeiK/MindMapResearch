pics,f07uscg,t3_d43w08,1568469312.0,"From another post about the same thing:

“The idea behind the original ideation was communicating the concept of empathy to the people who weren’t immediately able to experience it from the second-person perspective, so it put the subject into a referential context that could be reflected upon in the first-person by those types.

The original concept wasn’t depersonalizing women, it was trying to frame women’s issues in a way that people who have difficulty with second-person empathy could process.

This sign just kind of deconstructs back down to the idea they have difficulty processing. I mean, obviously it’s the better of the two ideas, but it’s just not as effective for some.”"
