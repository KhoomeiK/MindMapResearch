AskReddit,euh89w7,t3_cghhjn,1563822607.0,I was 8 and someone in my class told me. For 3 years I convinced my parents I still believed in Santa and in those three years I was able to get a pair of Beats headphones and some other good stuff. I donâ€™t feel bad about it.
teenagers,euh5i9x,t3_c9piwr,1563821191.0,"Me too! My friends will leave me on read and act like they didnâ€™t see my texts, but when I go on instagram they are active. It really bothers me a lot especially since I have anxiety and it makes me really anxious if they like me or not. Iâ€™ve told them many times with screen shots and stuff, but they deny it all, and will even get defensive and try to blame me for the *one* time I forgot to text back. I donâ€™t think they fully realize how crappy it makes me feel."
