Educate yourself on what it means to be transgender and how to support your child. Take them to a therapist. And jfc stop controlling and abusing your teenage son. Choosing to be a parent means nurturing your child for who THEY are, not some preconceived notion of what YOU want them to be. I too hope you are a troll. Very fitting for a TERF nonetheless."

 If not, would she consider talking to a licensed professional about how to cope? I think that would help the both of you.

In general, you just being on this sub and asking how to better help her is a great start along with trying not to trigger your GF. You could also do some more reading on this sub/interwebs/books on anxiety so she doesn't feel alone in this."
