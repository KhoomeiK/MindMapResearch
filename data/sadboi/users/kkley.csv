AskDocs,fm38wq2,t3_fss3nn,1585716025.0,"Take sertraline and atarax as prescribed. Only take clonazepam as needed because it is a controlled substance. Sertraline will work by increasing serotonin levels in your brain. After a month or two you should notice less to no anxiety or depression and maybe even increased mood. The atarax (hydroxizine) is basically an antihistamine that works in the same way as Benadryl or Zyrtec by calming the nervous system. It will not make you near as drowsy as clonazepam. If you need to take clonazepam try to start out by taking .25 mg if possible and if that doesn’t help, then take the other half."

After watching my skin sizzle away and wincing in pain the patch eventually healed and I haven’t had one since. Obviously applying bleach to your skin isn’t ideal, but like you I was afraid of it spreading and wanted it gone fast. Before I discovered using bleach I would use lotramin even the knock off brand and yes sometimes it would take a month for the spots to completely disappear.

I would constantly feel on the verge of a panic attack for about a week usually. I couldn’t think straight either or comprehend simple things and that’s what led me to say fuck alcohol all together.

I’m trying to research self help things until I can get professional advice...
