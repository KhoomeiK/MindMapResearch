masseffect,fqh2977,t1_fqgz17m,1589365331.0,"For some reason, I can't even bring myself to change what my shepard looks like, let alone make different choices. It's like my play through is cannon to me and I don't want to experience it any other way."

And still spend an hour each morning cause it must be hard to make them symmetrical."

skyrim,ffhlj4o,t3_etj196,1579940963.0,"I've had a dragon attack in Solitude once. It was a fun fight, but the skeleton stayed there forever. On my mage save, dragon attacked in Windhelm and because of how the city is built it was a bit more challenging, and involved basically running from the Palace to the market etc chasing the guy. He died at the graveyard lol. I turned him into a pile of ash and like 20 npcs gathered round it.
Skyrim has one of the best bugs. Never change Bethesda."
