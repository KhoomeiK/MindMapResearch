You are literally putting your life on the line every single day just to keep the world going for the rest of us.

This is NOT the flu, it's totally new and we're still learning about the things it does to people.

addiction,fpfq5sa,t3_gd6qcd,1588579502.0,"I used to have similar thoughts to you pretty regularly, and was addicted to weed as a coping mechanism so I may be able to offer you some advice.

Therapy takes time, you wonâ€™t notice a difference right away. I donâ€™t know what kind of therapy you are receiving, but if it is something like CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) that is designed to get you to change the way you think about things by helping you arrive at conclusions about yourself and your behaviour through therapy. Itâ€™s not necessarily about positive thinking, but more about giving you the tools for greater awareness of yourself and how your behaviours are effecting you. 

For instance, through therapy you may realize that a self destructive behaviour or impulse is rooted in a false assumption (ex. I must eat very little because I am obese when someone is anorexic). 

My suggestion? Continue with therapy. If after some time you still feel like you are not making progress, maybe try another therapist or even a different kind of therapy. Do what works for you after some trial and error.

 You can also explore the possibility of medication if your intrusive thoughts  and low mood are persistent and donâ€™t improve with therapy. Antidepressant medication helps me function much better than I would otherwise and it is for sure a much, much better option than going back to self medicating. Itâ€™s the difference between trying to stop feeling like shit and feeling pretty good and functional 99% of the time. Talk with your doctor to see if medication would be a good idea.

If youâ€™re in a bad place, lean on your treatment options and manage it the way that works best for you. Communicate with your doctors. Let them know if a medication is/isnâ€™t working. Tell someone if you are feeling like you might hurt yourself. Work on asking yourself â€˜why am I having this thought and is it really the absolute truth or is it just my brain being an asshole and doing something that should be ignored?â€™

 There is help but you need to put forth the effort to access it and maintain a treatment program, just like if you had a physical illness. You wouldnâ€™t miss a dosage of heart medication or a session of kidney dialysis. This is just as important for you, so you need to treat it with the same gravity. 

The good news is if you put forth the effort and are committed to your treatment, odds are you will start having more positive thoughts and fewer negative ones. Your perspective will probably change for the better. I hope this helps!"
