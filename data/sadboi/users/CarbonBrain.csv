I didn't come to reddit to 'advertise', I came to find people and ideas.


I'm not selling. I'm talking.

I'm not keeping. I'm sharing.

I'm not after anyone but my best self. 

I aim to build, and improve, not rend asunder. 

If I promote something, it's benevolent to the best of my knowledge and ability.

I'm not in this for credit, fame, fortune, or any of that ephemera; I'm in this to make changes. I honor Bernie Sanders, the legislator, with his ridiculous hair and bevy of uncredited successful bills, as a high example of this aim.

Life is a mess, and I'm a poster child for it. =)

I edit my posts and comments, to improve and update the information. I allow and expect the interested to dig and peruse and decipher. But not alone. I'm right here. Just ask. My profiles are unlisted but open. I await the earnest."

I'm trying to build a benevolent Village - with capacities for:

\- intentional community living

\- permaculture, simpleliving, tinyhouse

\- shared support, amenities, UBI

\- mental health obstacles: depression, lost souls, adhd, OCD, aspergers/autism, dpdr, etc

\- creativity and collaboration: digital projects, physical crafts

\- openness - blogposts, reports/audits, podcasts, etc

Of course birth and death are extreme and jarring when separated. Birth alone is horrifying, you just suddenly Existed! Death, with nothing beyond it, is too abrupt to conceive. Asking an existing to imagine not is worse than telling a fish to go with the wind, it's utterly inconceivable without context.

But life and death are not ends of a line, they are moments of a perpetual loop of growth (transmission), decay (reclamation).

Nothing you've ever known can be dual. They always form a singularity. Don't be separate. Be infinite."

The first sin is assuming anyone gets anyone else. Apologizing to the the universe that you ever ^(claimed you) had a clue is the first step to realizing its all approximation, from those less invested, felt less vividly.

Accepting you know nothing, and any glimmer of understanding is a morsel to protect, not contort, is like exploring a museum by flashlight. Those paintings are ^empirically incredible, how much did *you* appreciate them in that dim light?

tldr: NT (non-depressed) folks casually understanding (deep, long-term, non-emotional/situational/ephemeral) depression is akin to filming a night scene in daylight and adding the blue filter.

I can't function as a human and don't care much for what we've done with the world, and pretty much nobody relies on me, so, keep it, I'm out.

Fine, fine, I'm literally harmless, so I can't kill my body. So here I sit.

I tried everything. Poorly, admittedly, particularly when people or willpower were required, but I did try. And I strive to be earnest, and clear. 

So here I wait. 

I'd do anything I could for any one that asked, and stuck around long enough to receive. Oh well. I forgive everyone. Have fun doing it your way.

I'm forming a non-profit organization that owns and houses all of my projects, and caps salaries (generously, yet not egregious); the rest is recycled into benevolent humanitarian efforts, all above board and documented.

My people, starting with me, don't want the money, they want a living. I make sure that's well provided, and the rest doesn't sit in their vault, it goes back into use.

It's weird, but if you think it's neat I'll discuss it with ya.


Back of napkin numbers, annual:
* Me, $12k
* Ceos / founders $500k

And eventually, UBI for all workers. I'm eliminating wage work and giving everyone salary. I know I lost a bunch there, but this is for me, and my future; I'm not coming after anyone to change their life. Just mine and the folks that like it."
