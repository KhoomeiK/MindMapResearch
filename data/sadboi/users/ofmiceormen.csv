I am not really looking for sympathy when I posted this. I desperately hope this post can get through to some people that may be struggling. there's always hope. demons are heavy with too much time to think right now but I want to help people see how much pain this can cause not only to themselves, but to their loved ones, and that people are loved and there is hope."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,foxs0y5,t1_foxloy3,1588154266.0,"this kind of reminds me of something my Psych of Gender professor once talked about, ""Millie Millennial"" or something. 

basically she talks about how like let's shrink down 200,000 years of the history of modern man into 1000 years if it was personified to be a 1000 years old. I will surely get the numbers screwed up and I can't find the topic on Google so I don't remember if she had this original idea. 

anywho! it talks about how only in the last 10 yrs of that lifetime does modern society begin. before that we were ""hunting and gathering and fucking and making friends"" and then suddenly had to change the way we lived really drastically, and only in the last second is when jobs were a standard 9 to 5 schedule, and we worked the same shit worrying about shit that never happened 200,000 years ago like monogamy and religion, schools, and a cycle of the same job and routine every single day. 

basically the theory is that since we have not had enough time to adapt to this drastic change of behavior and that's why depression happens to so many people. 

these times are extra depressing because we are restricted to create variety stuck at home or working a job/being a student/both that doesn't provide much mental stimulation due to these restrictions.

idk I'm just rambling at this point because I'm awake at 3:00am unable to sleep and it triggered a memory"
