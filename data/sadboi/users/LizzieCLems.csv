changemyview,fqvscxs,t3_gkfvtk,1589684089.0,"Not all schools require the same classes. I graduated in 2013, and I did not have to take calculus, trig, or any higher tier math classes aside from algebra 1 and 2, geometry, and “math for college success” which was a simple class. I was so bad at math that I wasn’t even allowed to take calculus or trig. (C average). I had my 4 courses I had to take, and 2 foreign language. I was allowed to choose ASL, and I had 3 other courses that were up to me. There was also a few required classes (PE, and life skills come to mind), but I generally always had two electives that were up to me. So, some choice is still there, but school is also testing your “ability to learn.” You may not like math, or English etc., but you were able to learn it. Also, it standardizes each persons education across the nation, allowing everybody to have a general idea of what a high school graduate already knows, making college more standardized. (Also, I hate math with a passion and felt the same way, these are just the reasons why.)"
