I think you'll find the correct pronoun is He (again, capitalised). Third, my God, also *the* God, you *believe* is a myth, however you don't know that for sure; what is your proof? You also call Him an imaginary friend. If you knew about what you are talking about, you would realise that God is our Saviour, far more than a friend."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fn7bpn7,t1_fkhzwxh,1586717178.0,"Oh, I don't know, maybe because they're just myths? A wall that was described and spoken of in the Bible was actually found (Hezekiah's Wall) which shows that at least part of it is true. If there is physical proof that part of it is true, it does seem a little odd that the rest of it is a fairytale. Also, everyone worships something in a way, though they may not pray to it or bow down to it. People worship money, themselves, food, their family etc. Oh, and one last thing, don't ever compare God to an 'imaginary friend' or some mythical god. Christians are meant to spread love but, God forgive me, I've just about had it with you. You fucking mongoloid."

PewdiepieSubmissions,fkdtcqp,t1_fkdq9zh,1584094271.0,"This is just stupid. You obviously weren’t Christian as a child either, or you wouldn’t have just prayed when you had problems. This means that you can’t tell people to grow out of their faith when you have clearly never really experienced true freedom in Jesus Christ. As a young child, I too would pray when I was in trouble, but as I’ve grown up, I have discovered true freedom and love and grace in God. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened. I’m so sorry for you because you seem unable to really understand the Christian faith, maybe if you can see through your blindness in sin, you might be able to give God another chance; he hasn’t given up, and he will never give up on you! He loves you, even if you don’t believe it, and he will never stop loving you, just make it mutual and it will change your life for the better, I promise!"
PewdiepieSubmissions,fkdsv2s,t1_fkdkzbf,1584093615.0,"Christians don’t exactly ‘unlock’ everlasting life. It’s not a goal that you earn or achieve. You are saved by the grace and glory of God, because no human can ever be perfect, which means that they can never ‘unlock’ heaven. No good works can ever make you good enough to be perfectly holy, you have to ask God to save you, because He’s the only one that can."
