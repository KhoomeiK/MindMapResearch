I don’t recommend coming out when you haven’t built confidence, a supportive group and resilience!

bisexual,esad0bn,t1_es9pdew,1561756843.0,Yep absolutely and I love it! Don’t know when I realized insecurities could be turned into empowerment but I’m glad I did.

bisexual,esabbjm,t1_es9o1ex,1561755783.0,"Coming out to your SO was a big enough step and I think the only one that matters the most. You were vulnerable with your life partner and was granted acceptance and love :) 

It’s hard to ignore negativity feelings from your friends, and yes people will think you’re lying or looking for attention or just bi-curious and confused :( 
But it was all worth it for me because I did my part of honesty and I shared my truth. It’s a hard pickle to deal with I wouldn’t have come out when I realized I was bi early on because I didn’t have the courage then at all! So I’d work on building up courage and a ton of resilience! 

Parents confuse me lool, must be really hard to transition a mindsets of homophobia when it’s been there for longer than you’ve existed! 

You know all it takes is for someone to actually write a guidebook and put “Caution everything might fall to shit”."

bisexual,es8ewbl,t3_c6fmal,1561695589.0,"I came out as bi even though I was in a seemingly heterosexual relationship after 2 years. Let me back track, I told my SO I was bi about 2 weeks into my relationship but it was only a couple months ago I felt the need to come out publicly. It was important to me due to all the restless nights that I felt abnormal for being attracted to females (even more-so than males tbh). I read somewhere that it’s never just half and half attraction and that’s so true and OKAY.

 All that insecurity I needed to turn into empowerment! Being honest with myself and others around me I found so much peace (after all the dumb questions). Plus it weeds out all the homophobes you can casually remove from your life! 

 I love my SO and I’m glad I met him when I did. Only after looking back I can say his presence in my life made it so much easier coming to terms with myself and how beautiful I am."
bisexual,ep1s7kt,t1_ep1qdu2,1558994859.0,"Yeah I can only assume that when transitioning you need a safe environment to do so :( 

I hope you’re either able to leave your environment for a safer one or it becomes safer in the future due to a community that has unconditional love. 

Having friends is such a redeeming factor 😍 they can be closer than family at times. But yeah when you do choose to date again it’ll be ideal to be in a safe environment."

I’m glad I was able to grant you understanding on what I meant. 

And you’re right, it is very tricky celebrating diversity and confidence in one thing and trying not to divide. I wish it were easy or even possible to see how similar all humans truly are. It’s sooo important to share our differences and celebrate the similarities of being a part of the human race."
bisexual,eoz22y4,t1_eoz1k9h,1558951778.0,"You’re right, I should of used the term discriminated against in church. And oppression more-so in societal instances when LGBTQ are denied rights, murdered etc.  

I tried not but these labels are so prominently apart of my identity 🙃. So for me using them as labels of empowerment has become beneficial! 

I feel gifted that I’m a part of many minorities so that I can relate to a bit more people haha 

And I love the order in which you stated I should view myself it’s therapeutic. 

I believe I’ve risen from victimhood and transitioned to empowerment. Some days are challenging but I just need to remember who unique I truly am. You’re right I’m whole beautiful person 💕

My initial post is for the community I’m trying to create for those who feel oppression and have yet to find empowerment :( just be communicating and sharing struggles we can build others up!"
