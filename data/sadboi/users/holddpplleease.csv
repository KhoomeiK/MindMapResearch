Advice,fmla6z1,t3_fvolen,1586182224.0,"He sounds manic. 

My friend has BP1 and after her father died, she went into a very dangerous manic episode. This is veering off a bit but she was convinced that a celebrity was trying to reach out to her via a second Instagram account. As an example: she thought Drake was in love with her because she received a message from “brandnewraregems__2736ndhkahdE2737” she’d point out that it contained that letters D-R-A-K-E and the message would be a link to a spam bot. 

Delusions need care immediately."
BipolarReddit,flgfez6,t3_flj9pp,1585141203.0,"Highkey, I got lucky. (Bipolar 2)


I had a depressive episode that lasted two weeks before this hit my university and it subsequently shut down. Meaning I didn’t come to class for two weeks ALREADY. I had such agoraphobia that I would break down in front of my door panicking from fear and I’d have another once in public transit, then another by my university (I’d dip into a restaurant bathroom to cry and just end up going home). Then I began rapid-cycling. My grandma is dying, I’m not making enough at work, I’m failing my classes, all i want to do is cry in bed. This is all stress-related. I lost my terrible restaurant job and have had to file for unemployment and food stamps. I’m fighting with my landlord. 

But, i don’t know? I hope I’m not jinxing it but I get to stay home and away from stressors and that’s helped me calm down so much. I’m afraid for my family but they are toxic and abusive so I have no reason to go see them anymore now that we’re quarantined. I’m sick, but I’m always sick, and I can focus on healing at home. I wake up earlier to feel the sun through my window. My partner (who lives alone a block away) comes to sleep over for a couple of days a week. I have time to cook my meals instead of relying on takeout (stressor: spending money) or going to a friend’s bar by my uni and drinking (stressor: excessive alcoholism) 

Despite every single aspect of my life shifting and becoming frail and strange, I feel ok. I know how lucky and privileged I am to worry about internet connectivity issues instead of going off the rails. I don’t know what’s happening with this, with my rent, with my family, with food, with drugs or therapy, with my debt, it’s all terrifying... but I’m okay. I feel my hands and toes and the space I now have to write, read, reflect and i like it. 

I hope this feeling lasts."
BipolarReddit,fjc2755,t3_fcmgcg,1583206726.0,"My boyfriend sits with me, reminds me that he loves me, gives me space when I ask for it (within reason) and takes space when it becomes harmful, reminds me that he is not my enemy if I become aggressive, tracks my sleep, engages me in healthy conversation (he talks about his goals, and encourages me to think about mine). He sits down with me post-episode to speak about how I felt, let’s me know kindly and firmly how it might’ve affected him, asks, “In hindsight, what did you need from me in that moment” and “Moving forward, what can I do?” These answers change, because there isn’t one formula and reflecting on what you *need* is not easily done, but he exercises patience when I cannot and is committed to understanding me more and more as time passes. 

He is my rock, but he also isn’t afraid to confront his limits. 

One time, after an episode, he told me how scared he was at the prospect of me killing myself. He took three days to himself, and that’s okay for you to do - too. 

Every morning I wake up verging on tears over how loved I am. I’m crying right now, haha.

I wish you so much love, luck, and strength. Keep trying."
AskReddit,fja5jge,t1_fja56zg,1583166826.0,"Thank you! I can’t avoid episodes completely, even on the right cocktail of meds. I don’t have a plan, I’m not going to do it, and I feel more stable now than ever. But I will never avoid coming down - I can only lessen the intensity of it. Regardless, this is to say that it’s an ongoing battle and not as simple as seeking help first."
AskReddit,fja4qai,t1_fja2j3j,1583166348.0,"What about any of these scenarios alludes to a refusal to get help first? Many people with depressive disorders fight every day *not* to put that level of pain on their loved ones, but reach the edge. I myself continue to have suicide ideation when coming down from hypomania or having a mixed episode and this is while I’m on medication, on cbt/dbt, talking to others, etc."

EDIT: I am transitioning to veganism for environmental, socio-economic, and moral reasons. I can do this because I now have time and privilege, but coming from the Bronx in New York City, I see and experience how poverty can impact ones morals and needs everyday. It just isn’t feasible to expect veganism. Time is money. Money is money. Resources are not accessible."

I’m not so much emotionally invested in what she labels our friendship, however I find that when people ask me who she is in my life I don’t have another word that encompasses our love for each other besides partner. I don’t want to say “best friend.” It feels wrong. I also don’t want to come across as desperate to box people into categories but I do feel the importance of using terminology/language to help others (as well as myself) comprehend my philosophy on relationships. I’ll reflect on that."
