Trying to utilize all 4 fingers. Then do it with just your ring and pinky, then do it with your middle and pinky, then your index and ring, keep switching it up. It got me out of a bad habit I've made and had for a year where I'd only use my index and middle. A couple months of doing that made my fingers a lot more independent. Weird practice technique and pretty awkward, I'm not sure if it'll work for you, considering tendon damage as well, I also see spider walks recommended which is always a good technique to learn too."
AmItheAsshole,fqvvbr2,t3_gl7y6d,1589686009.0,"I can relate to this, my mom's done this since 2016 with the whole Facebook thing. From what it sounds like you two really don't talk too much with that phone in the way to begin with. So pointing out that she's not participating in family time, conversation, being hypocritical, etc, should be done. NTA. It seems like these are the same people that post Facebook memes about kids and their phones but yet don't interact with family in any way. It is really frustrating to get that ""hm"" or ""yeah"" or just flat out ignored when you ask something. They can't take 10 seconds to focus on something other than their phone. It sounds like she neglects some responsibilities. I'd recommend having a family member with you to confirm the issue and back up what you say and talk to her about it. But if she still denies it with a couple family members asking her to cut some phone time in favor for family time I don't think there's much you can do.

Yes you may have spent a lot of time on it, but obviously he's seen better. Maybe Jack should stop being so sensitive. Nathan could've called it shit if he truly thought that, but he didn't.

forza,fndut3y,t3_g16kso,1586877895.0,"Yep I usually get teammates that drive defensively against their own team to defend a mid pack position. It also doesn't help that the AI don't get slowed down from environmental hazards. Hit a fence and you lose, I'd guess, 7-10mph, AI just blasts through it."
forza,fndu9mp,t3_fxwkju,1586877604.0,"I wish I could do this alone. You'd think that if someone on your team is getting better lap times and overall are faster than you, you'd let them pass so they can get ahead of the pack but for some reason I always have some guy in the rental about mid pack driving defensively against the team and trying his best not to let them pass. It's only happened a few times but I've had people straight up ram me off the road if I'm passing them."

I think it was last year maybe a couple years ago a bunch of kids would run up to the one a couple clocks from my place and tear the food out, smash stuff, pour it all down the street, there would be nothing left. They would post it on Snapchat too. People called the cops on them and with how bad the policing is in my town, they let people go all the time for shit, they didn't get in any trouble at all."
