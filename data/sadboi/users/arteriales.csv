BipolarReddit,fdhotpo,t1_fdhn4kb,1578427175.0,"If a bipolar person is stable, they're functioning as a healthy person so it's effectively the same, and believe me that if you want to adopt they can tell if you're stable.

Also ""less developed"" sure, because of other countries who helped dictatorships and drained out resources in mine.

And still, we have free healthcare! Which makes treatment possible for low-income families as well. Any contraceptive (including surgeries) are also free, of course, but there are still children to be adopted. No contraceptive is 100% effective (you should know this, antinatalist!) and some people don't want to have abortions! That too is their right.

Education is free in my country, too, so I see no difference in discriminating by income.

Anyways, I consider this conversation over as I see no point in trying to convince someone who sees the world in black and white with no capacity for nuance, and also someone who is so quick to discriminate. We might both be bipolar but do not asume I'm anything like you.

 Good luck all the same!

Edit: WOW you're not even bipolar! More reason to stop responding. Educate yourself! Goodbye"
BipolarReddit,fdhmpjy,t1_fdhlied,1578425914.0,Maybe you have good orphanages over there? Believe me it's much better that a child be in a loving home (specially with stable parents) than them being mistreated and not fed enough in those places. I'm lucky my country has amazing anti-discrimination laws.

- Make sure that (beside your partner) you have a strong support network.

- Be prepared for a rough postpartum depression (You might not experience it! But preparation is key)"
BipolarReddit,fdh54kp,t1_fdh4uqu,1578415585.0,"Also: definitely not cruel. But in my case I'm waiting until I have at least 2 years of stability before adopting, so that's something to consider."
BipolarReddit,fdh4uqu,t3_eldhfz,1578415416.0,"I'm going through the same thing. I want kids and plan to adopt but I'm thinking about having a biological child, so I'm going to share what I think in case this helps:

The Cons:

- If your child is bipolar, they might blame you.

- Your partner might say they'll pick up the slack but if you don't have children you can't imagine the work you'll have to do (physically, emotionally, psychologically).

- Parenthood = almost constant stress, extremely bad for triggering episodes.

- If you're not stable, even if your partner picks up the slack, your child can tell and it will affect them.

- You can't 100% control not triggering genetic predispositions.


Now that we're all depressed, the Pros:

- You only have about a 25% chance to pass it.

- You trust yourself to be emotionally equipped to handle it.

- If your child is bipolar, they'll be lucky to have you. You would understand and be able to provide them with another perspective as someone more experienced with the disorder. And if you're stable, you'll give them hope.

- You know childhood trauma, this helps to avoid it for your child as much as possible.

- Your child would have a loving home, which is extremely important.

Ultimately is 100% your choice and I don't think you're selfish taking into account how much thought you're giving it.

I haven't decided yet, but I wish you the best of luck!"

SimsMobile,f4dwb96,t3_dk8l2f,1571548472.0,"I deleted the game because I hated the baking challenge, it just made the game boring for me. I'll keep checking this sub in case they add interesting things but... at this point it seems unlikely. 

I've seen people that like them and that's great, but for me it's anxiety inducing and takes too much time. I like to play videogames but I don't like to devote my entire life to them, you know? At least I feel like that would be the case because I have no irl money to spend. 

But what bothers me the most is that it kind of promotes gambling? I don't have addictive tendencies but a lot of people with mental illness use games as escapism and this game that previously brought them joy might make them develop a gambling addiction if they're susceptible, and it can be a very bad thing, it truly ruins lives. I know this is not the developers fault because they need a cash grab to keep the game running I guess, but still feels pretty irresponsible. 

That's just my opinion though, and I'm glad there's people who still have fun with Sims Mobile as we could all use a little joy in our lives."

I would push for it, the worst that can happen is you have a hypomanic episode in which case you should prepare the people around you, stop taking modafinil, and ride it out.

BipolarReddit,ev71sxz,t3_cikjc4,1564254153.0,"I've been with my gf for three years and here are some things I've learned:

1) Be honest about your bipolar and be clear this is just so they have all the information and is in no way an excuse for any shitty things you might do.

2) Take your meds

3) You will have doubts about the relationship because of your bipolar and because you are a human being but NEVER act on any of those doubts immediately. Wait to see if the feeling persists and if it does and it's something you can fix, do it (Think you don't know your partner? Why? Think why you like them: those are some things you know. Want to know them more? Go on a date to a place that's meaningful to them and ask them about it). This is hard because impulsivity is always a problem for us with bipolar and it's always easier to leave than to address any problem (yours or in the relationship).

4) Take your meds

5) Communication is key. Don't try to ignore the problems, try to fix them together. Discuss long term plans for your lives: see if those are compatible or if you'd be willing to compromise to make them compatible.

6) TAKE YOUR MEDS

You clearly want to make it work, so as long as you keep wanting to make it work throughout the relationship I'm confident that you'll succeed. Good luck, I wish you all the best üòä"
