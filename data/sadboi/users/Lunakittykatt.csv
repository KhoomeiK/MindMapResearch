My mom is one heck of a oddball in society, but she doesn't go around and think that shes trans because of it. I think that's quite a big stretch to make.

And what's this about everyone being required to affirm your existence? People who come out as trans often get rejected by their families and friends, and/or experience harassment and bullying far more than your average person. That's not very affirming now is it? Sure, you can go on trans support forums on the internet and get validated there, but that won't make up for all the shit you probably will get in real life.
