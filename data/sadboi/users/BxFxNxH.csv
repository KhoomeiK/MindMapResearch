Not enough jobs for people without an education which America doesn‚Äôt provide, and no where to live anymore. People with property all own hotels now thanks to Airbnb. Used to be able to rent a room, if nothing else. Today a woman started chatting with me. She‚Äôs 30 with 10 kids!

They‚Äôre pissed to have to work everyday only to have someone shit in their bushes. Even other homeless people hate homeless. Los Angeles is especially dangerous and there is no place to go where there aren‚Äôt other homeless people a few feet away. Early this morning I spotted two cars within only a few seconds, and if I‚Äôd turned the corner I‚Äôd have found five more, and that‚Äôs just people in cars on the two blocks that I was scoping, they‚Äôre also on the street, behind buildings, in stare wells, etc. If she has to be homeless I would go to a town in the middle of nowhere and stay out of sight so no one would make her a target."

Don‚Äôt waste this time and don‚Äôt spend all of what you do make thinking you have a career camming. Same applies to stripping at clubs.

Oh, and I know one other chick who does but she doesn‚Äôt make much, just been around so long she keeps it for the accounts that are on automatic billing. Even when things were still decent, porn stars were going from big bucks to ‚ÄúI need to buy a smaller house and get rid of the horses‚Äù. There are too many desperate chicks now and guys stealing then sharing the shows/images. It seems like a lot of cam chicks are now working from a site that lists FREE in its url. WTF. I never did a damn thing for free. Couldn‚Äôt even speak to me until I was getting paid. And with young people just hooking up on apps instead of having to be a real human out in the world, they‚Äôll never be a customer. Client base is literally dying. Seven years actually seems long to me. It‚Äôs been dying, the only thing that keeps it going are new chicks cause they don‚Äôt know any better. Guys know that cause they‚Äôre not new chicks and have been around long enough to see it failing. In fact, they‚Äôre the reason it‚Äôs failing.
