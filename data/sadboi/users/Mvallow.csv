I live in a place where war on drugs is fucking strict(if you know the place,then you know). I also hate the fact that it's (also other psychedelic substances) considered illegal to the point that some curious minds have no chance to explore,just because lots of dumbasses tend to abuse it. Trust me,I've tried alcohol but didn't also abuse and I don't even smoke. I haven't even taken a tiny amount of illegal substances but it felt like they(the government) have also taken some rights from us to know how such an amazing experience feels like,without abusing such the stuff.

I also loathed the fact that the topic drugs,itself,is stigmatized. Just a tiny mention of it and I'll get some harsh judgements,but I'm not surprised. Yup,freedom is just some illusion dude üòû

VoiceActing,ewedv4i,t3_cnsssp,1565321166.0,"I suggest to not depend much on cough drops because some brands might put sugar in it and you don't want sugar in your throat. It will just accumulate some mucus and it might get worse. 

This is my first aid whenever my throat starts soring. Also avoid something very sweet and cold. Always drink water to soothe your throat or something lukewarm like these teas:

 camomile,mint,lemon+ginger+honey+cinnamon =these are good flavors and has medicinal properties too

Also gargle salt+lukewarm water,3x a day for hygenic purposes. If you have anti-septic oral wash,that's better. Also avoid talking too much(your throat is still recovering). If your condition gets worse after 3 days,then you need doctor. I hope that helps.

edit: I almost forgot,for prevention,before you start your thing,warm up your vocal chords first instead of speaking loudly directly because if you don't warm up first then it will strain your chords and you don't want that. And always prep yourself with some water (never cold water,please) to avoid dry throat."
