raisedbynarcissists,ficox92,t3_f0w4oa,1582353463.0,"For the last year or two of my ""parents'"" (i use that very liberally) my mother accused my step-""father"" of being narcissistic, even went so far as to look up signs and symptoms and would readily use it in her smear campaign against him. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely narcissistic. After reading through other's stories in this thread I'm reading a lot of things that both ""parents"" did to me: they'd go on for hours lecturing me if I did anything wrong, tell literally everyone what I did (family, friends, the church, even strangers if they had the chance) all while finding any chance they could to berate me. 

My ""parents"" though are a special kind of effed up; not only did I hear the ""you can come to with anything"" lie, they would also say, ""we will always support you if you're doing something positive"". 

Here's a (long) story for ya:

I moved out on my 18th birthday which was in the middle of my senior year in hs while my mother was deployed to Iraq. The following fall when she returned home and came to visit our hometown, where I had since moved back to live with my grandparents after graduating hs, and proceeds to stand in the middle of the living room yelling at the top of her lungs to everyone that I was lazy, didn't want to work, go to school, or join the military and how my grandparents should put me out. 

Two months later I decided to go to school for nursing so I could ultimately pay for my own education in fashion (which my step-""father"" was vehemently against calling it ""faggot-shion""...i'm gay btw). So I call up my mother and ask her if she'll fill out my FASA forms and since they made it very clear they weren't going to help me out with college financially they could indicate that on the form. She tells me to talk to my step-""father"" since he's the one that does their taxes every year. I call him up later that day and he asks if I'm calling him as his son or just to use him. Long story short he didn't fill out my financial aid forms and I had to drop out halfway through my first semester. 

A year and half later I applied to an Art Institute to study fashion and even won a partial scholarship, but had to drop out because I was still considered a dependent. The only way to be completely free of needing them to pursue an education without wasting 7 years waiting to turn 25 so I could file independently was to join the military. 

After a 6 year contract I finally go to fashion school. My graduation comes around and my mother shows up, the first thing she said to me was ""I had to come to your graduation, people would talk about me if I didn't because I go to everyone else's graduation"" and repeated that whole afternoon. What's worse, my step""father"" shows up too wanting to take pictures...the very person that strangled me and told me I'd end up selling my body to old men for food if I left their house to pursue ""faggot-shion"". The same person who made a decision that delayed my progress by 8 years because he wouldn't fill out my financial aid paperwork paraded to my graduation and had the audacity to want to take pictures afterwards. My mother spent almost no time with me and my step-""father's"" last conversation with me was to tell me I wasn't a man, how he never wanted to marry a woman with a child that wasn't his own, and having to raise a child that was gay was literally the worst thing that could have ever happened to him in life. 

That's not all folks. After the summer I was going to get my master's in luxury management at a fashion school in Paris, but didn't have the money to afford the move after paying tuition, my visa, etc and I asked my mother if she could help me...she said she didn't have the money (a lie). In desperation I asked my step-""father"" for help. He offered me 0.03% of what I asked to borrow and sent me a poem about what it means to be a man, mainly he wanted me to learn what it meant to lose everything and have to start over. ""Starting over"" would mean losing about $30,000 worth of tuition I paid because I couldn't afford to relocate to Paris. What happened to ""we support you if you're doing something positive""

It wasn't until last winter my ""mother"", in an effort to get me to press charges against my step-""father"" for making me bend over so he could look at my anus to see if I was having sex with other men (she only wanted more ammo to use against him during their divorce), admits she asked him about filling out my financial aid paperwork a few days after our conversation all those years ago. My mother tells me that the financial aid officer basically told him I wasn't lying and if he was afraid I would do anything nefarious with their information they could block me from accessing that portion of my application. When she asked him if he would then fill it out, he told her no simply because he didn't want to. What's just as worse, my mother said nothing in protest and let it all happen. 

So here I am with combat related ptsd, bi-polar disorder, a fractured clavicle, bad knees that crackle and pop when I move, back pain, and foot issues from service in the army...because both of my ""parents"" are complete and utter pieces of sh*t, just now starting a career at 32 competing with people in their mid-twenties for an entry level job. Thanks narcissism 🙃"

With medications maybe I won’t feel [i]quite[/i] as drained after spending the day interacting with others and overall less averse to going out, but I don’t think I’ll become a full-blown extrovert though. In your case, maybe it’s a bit of both. You could naturally be an introvert, so you want to keep to yourself; while left with your thoughts more than the “average” person during your alone time (with the assumption that extroverted is the societal norm) you’re likely going to reflect on your low self-esteem and anxiety, which makes you more introverted than you might be naturally.

On 16P I mostly typed intp with a few entp outliers, except for the one time I decided to answer as my true self and tested infp. The last six months or so I decided to sit down and read more on infp since the full 16P description of infp felt like they knew me on a deep level versus intp that felt like a superficial reading. 

While reading this description and number of others (to include FiNe descriptions) I noticed a lot of overlap amongst these and my mental health - anxiety, depression, anti-social behavior, introvertedness, a bit ADD, often starting projects though rarely finishing, feeling separate from my peers or society in general, feeling deeply, etc. 

Some say they are not necessarily linked, though I believe there is most likely a link of some sort. Like you I've read posts in the anxiety (bipolar type 1 or 2 and depression reddits) that are essentially identical to infp posts around here.

There is greater concern for social, environmental, and economic issues among your generation than ever before. I like to think millennials are more evolutionary, while gen-z is more revolutionary. Think back to baby boomers; they completely changed society, it seems you all will be just even more revolutionary (in a good way). Hopefully in a decade when you’ve gotten older (and hopefully more mature and wiser), the narcissism and vapidness will fade. Sometimes it hard to believe that boomers with their antiquated views were once the weed smoking, free love, peace and equality for all generation."

Don’t let the news scare you too much, you could be sitting at home and something bad could still happen. Depending on when the interview is scheduled you could do a few practice runs, try staying overnight for a day or two.

Hope whatever you choose helps if you give it a try. 

I'm really just beginning to understand the magnitude of the trauma from my childhood, but the good thing is I'm rediscovering parts of myself that were supressed. 

Delving into another person is so fun, but then it can be a bit of a wake-up call to notice others aren't quite as interested in doing the same...so, we have to find ways to function in a world that fundamentally doesn't understand us."

infp,ffrhvcj,t1_ffqk62q,1580158322.0,"Doesn’t it get annoying when people keep asking to speaking up, I want to tell them to listen harder lol. Perhaps you’re just using a different part of your body (maybe just your throat) to speak, a professional could easily help you figure it out. The thing with apps, at least for me, is that some things just have to be done in person where you can get immediate feedback otherwise you’re essentially working in a closed loop with no custmoized feedback, which is important when learning anything. An app can tell you to use your diaphragm or engage your core/gut/belly, but it can’t (at least without a real human on the other end to give real feedback) let you know if you’re doing it right. There’s also something called the Alexander Technique that might help as well, I’ve never tried it, but the few people I know who’ve tried it said it works wonders for them. 

Yeah, having military parents (both were drill sergeants at one point) definitely made for a rather interesting childhood as an INFP. actually for years I tested as an XNTP (mostly INTP) on personality tests, but felt it only connected with the way I behaved...it wasn’t until I explored cognitive tests and profiles (and did another personality test answering truthfully) did I realize I’m an INFP. Perhaps it’s one reason I get annoyed when peopel dogmatically stereotype INFPs as having only a specific set of behaviors. It helped in some ways, but I feel like it sort of cut of/stunted my creative, expressive side. 

You’re most likely not boring people, if you’re anything like me, you’re actually losing them. People - especially in the super fast, digital age we live in - have short attention spans so we have to find ways to either improve delivery to keep them along for the ride or keep it short and sweet before they tune out. With that in mind it’s surprises me that more INFP YTers don’t care enough to present their content in a more engaging, concise manner. If you don’t know of any it’s ok; there are two I’m pretty good with (Geek Psychology and Lex Morningstar), but a third that I like the most hasn’t posted a video on quite a while (Lejla)."

Though one professor did tell me something worth sharing: you may be naturally really good, but if you spent even one more day on your work it could be fucking great. 

The grades are always nice to have, since that’s what society only seems to care about, but for your own personal satisfaction strive for more.

Not sure if it’s relevant, but consider why you chose your major. To make someone happy or is it what you truly care about? That could be a potential reason for your procrastinating."
infp,ffq22kq,t3_eudq4s,1580116116.0,Welcome! Check out some readings and be sure to explore more about the cognitive functions to get a better idea of INFP (or even ISFP). Be careful of what you read because some discuss personality while others focus on functions. For even more fun check out the enneagram if you haven’t already.
infp,ffq1vxx,t3_eukhgl,1580115826.0,"1. It depends on the situation for me, but I usually need to make sense of everything if I’m going to help a friend with a problem...so I guess yeah, the details matter - at least for me. There could always be something that could change the solution for the problem so it’s best to have all the details so there are no surprises.
2. This might depend on the person. I have gone very long stretches without any romantic interest, so there may be something else at play there.
3. Again, speaking for myself: I prefer my friends to be honest and tell me the truth, but in as gentle, yet clear and direct a way as possible...so as not to feel attacked, judged, or belittled."
infp,ffq18bh,t3_eufg0p,1580114827.0,"The stuttering was something I never developed thankfully, perhaps because my early years were formed by a capricorn who took time to help me develop. However, I do speak softly and it takes effort to project my voice more. Perhaps my natural affinity to perform or impress helps with public speaking and presenting (I get soooo nervous), but apparently it isn’t obvious. Also being raised by military parents and later joining the military may have helped a lot. Though as a child - even now a bit - I had a tendancy to ramble, go off tangents, tell backstory or sidestories for context, etc.

Glad you brought this up because earlier today (well, yesterday) I was thinking about how the a number of INFP youtubers I come across (one in particular that YT just won’t stop recommending) have issues with speaking up, clearly, or dynamically, which is really unfortunate because most have something to say that might be rather interesting. Instead I usually fall asleep or lose interest and end up watching another type speak on INFPs. To that point if you happen to know of any good YTers please let me know (not to take over your thread or anything :) 

Try taking voice lessons, they’re not just for singing, I noticed after a few singing lessons my speaking voice was much louder and had more presence. There are people that focus specifically on professional speech as well with clients that range from everyday people like yourself to business people wanting to improve their presentation skills to news anchors. Imagine combining a more commanding speaking voice that can articulately express all your mind blowing thoughts."

Seriously though, meetup.com could be an option since they have groups for just about everything.

Penpals might also be worth considering.

Next time be smarter and remember you were out numbered, even if it is a one-to-one think about whether you would be able to defend yourself if necessary. If things turned physically violent no matter how right you are, the black eyes, broken ribs, or whatever else they would have inflicted on you wouldn’t be worth the righteous high road of “telling them off” or confronting them. I must add I came out before it was anywhere near as socially acceptable as it is now and had with slurs, rocks, glass bottles, and other inanimate objects thrown at me. Just because we have legal protections and we’re more accepted socially doesn’t mean everyone agrees with/accepts our lifestyle...and it certainly doesn’t mean we should try to confront everyone that disagrees with us. 

As far as your brother is concerned: you can either hide it from him or tell him, but looking at posts from your profile it seems he very well may already know. Do what you feel most comfortable doing.

Also, are actually struggling with depression the mental illness or was this just a really low moment or bad day for you. Not attacking you, but right now I’m sitting in a dark room, with no desire to do anything (eat, breath, brush my teeth, take a shower, talk to a friend, anything), and I’m mulling over ways to end my life. Reading this reddit (and a few bipolar reddits) with posts from people that are actually suffering from depression the mental illness (not in a low mood, not just having a bad day, or a merely troubling thought) is one of the few things that helps me because I know there are others out there just like me. Reading the encouraging responses to those depressed individuals experiencing the same or similar circumstances can sometimes be enough to distract my mind from the negative, vicous loop it can get stuck in. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it doesn’t seem like you’re dealing with depression the mental illness, which for someone like me that is (I’ve been diagnosed with MDD, PTSD, and Bipolar Disorder) it’s really insulting to read someone with a low mood or having a bad day claim to be depressed. It’s like a person that’s stressed saying they have anxiety, they are two distinctly different things. I think part of the reason people with depression are sometimes marginalized is because people don’t really understand the magnitude of depression, so people think it’s merely feeling down or having a bad day, they’re not the same. Again, I’m not attacking you and I’m really sorry if this was misdirected...it’s just I’ve seen a number of posts over the last few days from people that don’t have depression, but are having a bad day and it really irks me because there are reddit for that. Think of it as Naomi Campbell saying she suffers from depresson because she has a zit one day."

When I said I wasn’t expecting there to be a correlation, I meant that I was not expecting a one to one equivalent (e.g. pisces aren’t mostly one specific mbti type). I’m wondering is if there are greater similarities within the MBTI and astrological combinations, for example: are there nuanced simlarities amongst those that are INFP aquarians, whereas INFP capricorns - though broadly similar to all other INFPs - share a greater depth of similarity with other INFP capricorns. To elaborate: there are a lot of people that would label INFPs as being creative in an artistic, musical, or literary sense though there are some that don’t have any of those abilities and instead prefer coding or something - what would be interesting is to see if those that aren’t creative INFPs are usually libra, for example. I really hope I made it more clear this time."
