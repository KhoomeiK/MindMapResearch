Amd,fqc6qrl,t1_fqc6lyq,1589251283.0,So in your mind just using the 5700 XT with my monitor wouldn't be worth it?
Amd,fqc6fli,t3_fu5fle,1589251097.0,"I think I messed up guys; I just bought an AMD card when I own a G-Sync monitor.

I own [this monitor](https://www.gpucheck.com/monitor/27-viewsonic-xg2703-gs/). 1440p, 165hz, and G-Sync. Had it for about two years.

In a lapse of brainpower I jumped on a sale for a new 5700 XT. I was stoked until my friend asked me ""your monitor is freesync, right?"" My heart dropped.

From here I see two options: Just return the card and go for a 2070, or unbox the 5700 XT and see how it looks. 

Really I'm hoping to be able to just use the 5700 XT and not have to mess around returning it/buying Nvidia, so I want to get your opinions on what it would look like to run this card on my monitor, regarding frame tears/drops etc.

My worry is that if I open it and try it in my computer and it's terrible, I'll have a much harder time returning or selling the card.


TLDR: I'm an idiot"

buildapc,fqc1r8k,t1_fqc0oc3,1589248335.0,"I'd definitely prefer to return the card rather than the monitor since it's still boxed and I just bought it so it'd be much easier.

Calling players by their in game name has been done since the beginning of esports. 

Sure I’m not a huge fan of some of the names, particularly the ones that seem like they take themselves too seriously. Like scrub killa, torment, and firstkiller. But for the most part I think in game names are cool and are a more interesting identifier than just the players real names. Can you imagine if the casters just used all their real names? “Aaaand here comes Jeff with the pass, and wow Stephen with the goal!” Would sound lame imo. 

Like what happens when you play a team game and people refer to you as your screen name? Are you like “uhhh please call me Jacob, screen names are “cringe””. Lmao"
