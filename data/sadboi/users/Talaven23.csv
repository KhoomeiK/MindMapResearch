AskReddit,ff5dw16,t3_ero8mj,1579588762.0,"The 13 year old me would be disappointed in what I've become. I've tried a plethora of drugs and turned into an alcoholic. Got a DWI went to jail for a day and a half, and lost my license. I lost all my childhood friends because of the drugs and alcohol. So yeah pretty sure my 13 year old self would think I'm pretty pathetic. Didn't do anything I dreamed of back then. If this is rock bottom for me the only way is forward, or something like that."

depression,fc28fjr,t3_efrqny,1577345373.0,"If what's eating you up is from that past don't focus on it(easier said than done ik) what's happened has happened you can't change it. Focus on the present you to change your future and in turn it'll change your outlook for the next day it's a slow process but in time you can get there. Happiness is hard to obtain. When you find happiness the bar for it gets higher each time, try to focus on what brings you joy like your supportive family, good bf, getting a del. what you want like psychiatric care. The past weighs us down. Imo it's best to focus on what you can change(your present self) not what you can't. Hope it helps"
depression,fc26ghg,t3_efs1f7,1577342559.0,"As you age things become more difficult imo. As a teen I used to game for enjoyment but now that I'm in my late 20s gaming doesn't bring me happiness anymore. Sure i enjoy them but not like i used to. Happiness is a hard thing to acquire because each time you obtain it the bar for it becomes higher. Try to focus on what brings you joy and happiness will come to you much easier, that's what works for me at least."
depression,fbuhqfw,t3_eelt9z,1577114606.0,Idk if this is advice but don't seek out happiness. Everytime you find it the bar gets higher to find it again. Seek out joy in what you do have. It sucks that you didn't get accepted but maybe it just wasn't the route for you to go. You can always try again. Life gets bumpy before it get better.

depression,fbl1cz3,t3_edpkii,1576957344.0,"I do the same thing. I've destroyed countless friendships because of it and most of my family won't even talk to me because of it. It can be a normal conversation nothing wrong and I just pop off at my friend or family member I talk to. It kills me inside I know it happens I realize it and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I've screamed into a pillow ,punched walls, anything to release the built up anger..."
depression,fb3ak65,t3_eb2q4s,1576468114.0,"I don't  even enjoy sleeping anymore. I just put myself through as much misery as possible hoping something takes me out. My family's noticed too I've become a walking stick, just having a gloom around me and ruining a good mood anywhere I go. It's a struggle that i may overcome but to me the grave will be my redemption. I've lost every friend I've talked to about what's going on. They are disgusted by it and it's upsetting to a point I guess"
