WhitePeopleTwitter,fki3dz5,t1_fkhcpae,1584211168.0,Good thing I'm in my third month of isolation
lgbt,fkfzj5a,t3_fi8m0p,1584146263.0,The only thing that's changed is that friends and family are talking about it. I take classes online and the only time I leave my house is usually just to go to work which is at a fast food place.
askgaybros,fkfvli1,t3_fi3n7p,1584143586.0,"I don't really think it's really the same as the n word but use if you want, who's gonna stop you. I'm also used to toxic gaming community where people constantly blurt the n word lol"

gay,fk0altc,t1_fjzvt65,1583749870.0,Samee
askgaybros,fjivgv5,t1_fjirp6p,1583376674.0,"Thanks for the app recommendation. Though most apps it just seems like it's the same guys, but with a different look."
askgaybros,fjir8pq,t1_fjimx9t,1583373920.0,"Sorry I'm just salty af atm. Maybe it's just my area or something, but everyone is a flake or just generally a pos. I'm not exactly interested in the hookup culture of gay apps, or how everyone seems to be in an open relationship."
askgaybros,fjim79d,t3_fdji65,1583370706.0,You only think guys are hot because you're gay and your brain is wired as such. If you were straight you would be glad to be straight. Id rather not have to deal with our shit gay culture
gaybros,fdl1id7,t1_fdki5hz,1578515419.0,"I still have yet to talk to a couple that isn't in an open relationship, but coming from my experience. I'm sure there are non open relationships but it seems rare or you just don't notice them as much since they're not typically on apps and such."
SuicideWatch,fd5bym4,t3_ejysqk,1578176081.0,Same. I want to down a whole bottle of vodka and then some but I feel like going that route would be painful.
gaybros,fd4jszh,t3_ejwhh1,1578168174.0,I can't even find anyone in my city who wants to even date. Some people will claim they want to date but it always ends up being a casual hookup.
gay,fd4iyy8,t3_ejzncf,1578167885.0,Love isn't even permanent tho
gaymers,fc5vnuh,t3_eg316h,1577466884.0,What's a bf
gaybros,fc414nb,t1_fc40k90,1577403881.0,Same here. It seems like everyone in the community only cares about sex and hookups. No one wants to make any meaningful connection.
gaybros,fc35th1,t3_efwhx1,1577382160.0,How is this wholesome. Most of it seemed like guys were just using him for sex and then throwing him away right after.
askgaybros,fbaox5t,t1_fbamx91,1576683526.0,Pretty much everyone in my area is either already in a poly or open relationship. I'm open to poly but it's probably not my thing. Considering that I haven't had a relationship before I can't really know what works for me. I must be picky or something though because I rarely ever get attached to anyone.
askgaybros,fb97e8f,t1_fb96gdz,1576631274.0,"Yeah I have. I've pretty much said that I got feelings but he didn't want to get into anything serious due to his recent break up, but at the same time has said he was interested in me which confuses me.

When we stopped hanging out for a while I asked him about it and he's told me that he has felt bad about it but was currently dealing with stress in his life. He has planned to hangout again but idk"

edit: a word"
gay,f88v6ib,t1_f8836xd,1574361858.0,Same. Still not out so idk if I would have joined anyhow
askgaybros,f80tfvh,t3_dydumk,1574137840.0,Same
gay,exqjkrx,t1_exolgb7,1566503087.0,It's the point that you're already depressed and masturbating gave temporary happiness.
gay_irl,es9sh01,t1_es809jj,1561743485.0,Pretty sure mwm means married white male. Not sure what gen stands for though.
askgaybros,es9nr4a,t3_c6hpws,1561740418.0,Probably
MurderedByWords,erhps8z,t1_erhga3k,1560880251.0,"I'm gay and pretty much only wear t-shirts, hoodies, and shorts. People almost always assume I'm straight since I'm not feminine and probably by the way I dress."
askgaybros,er3xye1,t3_c07hra,1560475824.0,I don't even use Instagram lol
lolgrindr,eqrhwya,t1_eqr7rc2,1560261391.0,I usually start using a new picture every couple of months.
lgbt,eqqmmit,t1_eqp4yyr,1560225118.0,I kinda wanna go too but don't really have anyone to go with. My family seems like they don't like it either and say that it's just a bunch of naked gay men.
askgaybros,eq23bky,t1_eq0efhq,1559727078.0,"I still doubt myself when someone I barely know compliments me on anything. For some reason I don't believe them, even though they wouldn't benefit from anything by lying."
askgaybros,epnwln7,t1_epmavug,1559334609.0,"You can encrypt any kind of data, including images. Though there isn't really a point unless you're afraid someone will go onto that device finding them. 

Sending them to others could he risky and in most cases would have to be unencrypted for the receiver to see regardless."
gay,epl6c39,t3_bv0zo6,1559288443.0,No one knew I was gay so this never happened to me lol
