BPD,fl0sshw,t3_flu15k,1584714946.0,"same issue here, but i'm not in any shape to do a gender switch. it'd cost at least $200k and  probably still look like a dude anyway. we're going into a recession now as well, so that money won't just pop up anytime soon. also i don't need any other problems. having this mental sickness is enough"
BPD,fkfab11,t3_fi5uy8,1584130139.0,everyone always comments on me walking fast. but i like doing things fast
BPD,fkf51z8,t1_fkf30r8,1584127206.0,"Fair. Are there any successful BPDs though? If i'm doomed to be personality disordered I'd rather have the one that is most beneficial to me. It will always be destructive so it's not really about reducing that. BPD is destructive to myself and others, NPD is destructive to others but helpful to me, no matter how sad i feel inside.

You mention some narcissists that are miserable but BPD leaves you in constant disarray emotionally, eventually giving you the same result. It's a question of, ""would you rather cry in a benz or a box?""

 I don't enough to comment on the other PDs."
BPD,fkf2e7l,t1_fkf1nsi,1584125643.0,"Thanks for this.

I may be confusing the disorders. I'm not a professional, but I'm trying to understand myself a bit more and how to navigate life. It's pretty self evident that BPD is more limiting as NPD is moreso pushing you forward whether you like it or not. I always thought of them on as two sides to a coin though. I may be wrong."
BPD,fkf0dnz,t3_fi3u8m,1584124460.0,"it is, most people are passive about it, but people like us have to become better at playing defense. that's all really"
