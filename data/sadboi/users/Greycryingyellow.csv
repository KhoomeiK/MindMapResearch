 most of the time they just want to be seen. but the part of integration I don't get is the part where its sarcasm is like the middle ground. I don't really Like think it violates the environment to not reply all the time.

going through an experience of jealously isn't great, but finishing is good for your persons.  


So, to me it was the whole experience. yet my attention played a critical role for what I do. so i'm kindof in a learning stage myself. but it all gets a little mixed up when I go through it. so like. I'm impulsive because of the co-operation I hold. Just make sure no one is adding something un-noticeable that's like a Non-communicative things. Some times people add things all together and keep it as one relationship. The stages I'm in are sort of lead astray but this could be so subtle we don't even see it.

If you can just Notice something new or maybe hangout with a friend. For me trying to work out the direction i'm pulled in ends up being like a two-week trap for disengaging and not even seeking possible alters, and by the time I look back and think of How may faces I've passed or the factive/Fictives I live in. nothing seems to be any better Than what works for the next person.
