I really hope that you don't have to live with this as long as I have. It is a life changer. Wishing you the best.

Also to add, I was sick at the end of February before testing was available in the US. My doctor now believes I had covid at that time. It's hard to tell if I'm still having symptoms from that because it's too similar to how I usually feel but I am having shortness of breath as something I hadn't experienced before."
