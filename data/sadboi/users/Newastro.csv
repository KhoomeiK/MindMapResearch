I get severe anxiety around them and will literally avoid eating just so I don‚Äôt have to be around them.

Another example is that I can‚Äôt make phone calls, because they give me anxiety and panic attacks as well. It‚Äôs an important responsibility that I lack. Just makes me feel even more useless. 

And, of course, I have never told anyone about this anxiety.

I have heard of DBT therapy but didn‚Äôt know much about it. Looks like it could be useful. But I don‚Äôt know how to ask for help. When I make posts about how I feel, and people support me and say ‚Äúyou should talk to someone‚Äù, I appreciate what that they are helping and I know I should but I just can never follow through with that.
