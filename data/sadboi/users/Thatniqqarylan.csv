ShouldIbuythisgame,fquzvpw,t3_gksu90,1589667095.0,"Only get it if you REALLY loved origins. It basically doubles down on every change in origins.


I bought the complete edition a while ago. Tried to grind it out for a while but ultimately gave up completely. There's so much stuff to do and it's ALL repetitive except for the main story missions, and even those are the same. If you're a completionist who plays something like fallout and gets distracted by new locations and you start zig zagging around the map looking for stuff, don't play this game. There's literally too much and you keep expecting encounters to be different but it's all cookie cutter. You eventually just forget there's a story because all you're doing is taking the same forts over and over and then you realize you've not even made a dent. To make things worse, all the enemies respawn after a while so it makes you feel like your effect on this world is zero."
