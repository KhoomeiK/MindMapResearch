And being kind to yourself requires a great deal of strength and courage, so feel proud about it. And remember: be patient with yourself, it is ok to make mistakes, it is ok to feel pain, just don't hold on to any of it. Be like Elsa, let it go :3"

Praise the gods  of music for keeping her with us ‚ô• I recently ordered the limited edition vinyl of Bon Voyage. Can't wait to listen to it. I love the cover art and Shirim is a haunting beauty of song. I remember the first time I heard that song. I was on acid and just could not stop listening. Melody, ma puce, j'esp√®re que la vie soie gentille avec toi."
depression,fe8bmj1,t3_enrs4c,1578924552.0,"This happened to me a lot as well. Been taking antidepressants for a month and a half now and I am starting to see the light out of the tunnel. I would recommend the thing I did at first: step away from social media, and if you feel like talking about your problems to a friend, ask them out or tell them to visit you. The crave for connection does feel awful when your mind is constantly sabotaging you. But know that asking for help and showing your vulnerability is actually a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you need help and that you are scared, because trust me, most of us human beings feel that way.  And the minute you open yourself to others great things start to happen. I am sure there are friends out there who want to help you because they genuinely care about you, just give them the opportunity, go for a coffee, let this moment pass, let all moments go. You are not your mind, you are not your actions, you are not your emotions or words, you are the consciousness that is observing your life unfold, the voice in your head that never stops, observe that voice, rise above it, take it easy on yourself, you got this :)"

Spanish,fe4m5d3,t3_enlm0x,1578860765.0,"I would recommend using Spanish subs as well. It helps you match the phonetic  and ortographic system. Since English and Spanish are not related languages - even though around half of English vocabulary comes from French, which is, like Spanish, a romance language - you would lose a lot in the translation. So, unless you are an absolute beginner, I would definetely discourage you from using English subtitles. Hope this helps :)"

AskMen,fe3nwll,t3_enlczz,1578851197.0,"I fell in love with a girl when I was 7. I did tell her about my feelings, but it just was not corresponded. I don't think the emotion completely left, it just mutated into something different. I read a few oriental philosophies and came to understand that true/healthy love is non possessive, so, if you ever really love someone, you won't really suffer about them not being in a relationship with you. If you love someone, you wish them the best, support  them in becoming the best possible version of themselves, even if that means letting go. 


Worry not, true love will find you in the end."
