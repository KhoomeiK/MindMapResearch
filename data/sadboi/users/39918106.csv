SuicideWatch,fqqdmmu,t3_gk7spi,1589563702.0,"I’ve been battling these same logistics for 10 years. The only reason I haven’t done it because 

1. I don’t want to put my normal healthy roommates (who know nothing of my mental health other than I have anxiety) to go through the trauma of finding my body. Which could be a week because.. we mainly keep to ourselves 

2. I moved to a new city for a job 2 years ago, I left all my family and friends. I don’t want to put them through traveling all the way to this city and packing up my room and moving me out. (A solution to this would be I secretly start boxing up my things in my room or start donating / throwing away stuff. 

3. I lost my job recently. I don’t want people to think I killed myself over being laid off like I’m so weak I couldn’t handle that. This is something I’ve battled for 10 years. I just simply have nothing left to live for. No purpose.

4. My best friend from high school killed herself last year. I haven’t been the same since. Because at the time I was thinking about ending it too. She had more friends than me and was more loved. I know when I die no one will mourn me. Maybe my mom and dad and 1 of my sisters. But the rest won’t notice a difference in their lives

5. I’ve suffered in silence for 10 years because my oldest sister has bipolar and borderline personality disorder and substance abuse issues. She’s attempted to kill her self 4 times (all times after a guy broke up with her) it was all for attention — I don’t want to kill myself for attention. I merely want to slip away and end the pain I battle everyday and not have to fight my mind about contemplating suicide 15 times a day. 

6. I have PTSD and anxiety. I’m insecure, completely paranoid about my trauma and constantly paralyzed by fear that someone is going to hurt me again - this has ruined many friendships over the years because I don’t like getting close to people cause they could hurt me."
