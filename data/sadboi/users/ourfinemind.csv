Blogging,fqkh6p3,t3_gdu0gd,1589427218.0,"I am a brand new blogger who only started last week. I have two posts in total, and I am currently lacking the courage / confidence to write more as i’m uncertain about the quality of my work or even my language use. 

The way I write is rather colloquial, and I feel like that’s me. That’s how I write, and I feel very attached to it. However, I sought feedback from some individuals who’re good writers, and they said that my writing was not good.

My question is, is there a standard of writing that I have to adhere to for readers to read easily? 

Does anyone face similar problems starting out as well

LifeAdvice,fqkcpej,t3_gjasij,1589424579.0,"At the age of 25, i’m unfortunately also facing similar issues. I’ve always wanted to be in banking, so that’s the route that I took. To be in a good school and graduate with an economics degree. After 3 years of working in the field, i realise that wasn’t what i wanted, neither was my passion there. I am also passionate about helping people, and interested in the field of psychology. Hence, despite being a huge detour, i decided to do further studies in the field i’m interested in. I want to live a life where I feel happy and alive, not dreading my feet to work everyday.

For you, if you know deep down that studying is not for you, then you should listen to your instincts and possibly look into our routes. Again, you know yourself best. Cheers!"

i’ve always loved being with people, socialising and everything. I thought i was an extrovert, until i had to be home for 2-3 months straight because of this virus. Surprisingly, my mental health is better than ever. (I thought i was gonna explode stranded at home).
During this period of unemployment, my goal is to start a blog about mental wellbeing, and write on this subject matters. It’s so close to my heart and i’ve never felt more excited about anything else. 
Thanks for your tips though. Working with animals would be such a dream, but not possible in my case unfortunately (no zoo nearby)"

depression,fpr4kge,t3_ger8m1,1588842148.0,"I remember when i was 15, it was so hard for me to breathe and i felt so suffocated i had to roll on the floor to feel better. Weird me. I went to the doctors and there was nothing i could do. I wonder if it was anxiety or mental health problems.

Now when i’m having a depressive episode, i feel so emotional that physically my heard would ache and i couldnt breathe. It’s like me suffocated and choked with so much emotions.

Anyone feel me too?"
depression,fpr3aa5,t3_gf1u8j,1588840844.0,"Unfortunately depression has a way of distorting your way of thinking, making you believe that you’re really worthless and that nobody would ever like / love you. Which are all untrue of course. 

Start practicing appreciation and gratefulness for the little things. It’s really not easy and many would dismiss it right away, but if you incorporate it in your everyday life, you may start to see yourself becoming more positive by the weeks. It’s amazing."
depression,fpr2fjm,t3_gf1p1t,1588839988.0,"For about 2 whole years in university, I was completely ‘not myself’ and i knew it. I always told my friends that i was having a clouded / foggy mind but none of them understood. My good guy friend (who eventually became my boyfriend) even told me ‘maybe that’s just who i am’ (implying that my brains were just slow and i’m just naturally dumb). Was super heartbreaking and i actually believed that i was dumb/slow, perhaps a sign of aging. 

I literally have headache or an extremely heavy head moments after flipping open my laptop or starting my homework. Insane.

After seeking help and starting medications, plus a change of environment and less stress, i slowly recovered and i am now rather sharp and fast (in terms of my cognitive ability). 

There’s no hard and fast rule to recovery, unfortunately. Meds/therapy may help, but working towards a positive mindset may also help you too. For me, i also started having a better diet and eating my vitamins. I actually saw a 100% improvement upon starting multivitamins. 

Hope i helped!"
LifeAdvice,fpqoi2v,t3_gf0081,1588827802.0,Find out your true passion and not work for the sake of working. Doing what you like is much more sustainable in the long run. Don’t regret in the future when it’s too late
happiness,fpp32du,t3_geofu7,1588795092.0,"Personally i don’t think that the feeling of ‘happiness’ should not be the end goal for us, as it is fleeting and momentary, and is generally linked to us having more in life (material possession, popularity, career etc). 

My thoughts is that contentment would be a good state to be in. A feeling of bliss, a radical acceptance of everything (yourself and others), and appreciating the tiny bits in life. 

So i’d say i’m at a 5-6 in terms of a happiness scale for now, and for these few weeks despite being cooped at home. And i’m not aiming for a 10 too..."
BPD,fpouvi0,t3_gegnp0,1588791061.0,"Does anyone else feel like there is completely no hope to anything in life, especially during an episode? 

The smallest thing could set me off. My downward spiral is real, from being angry at my boyfriend to feeling completely worthless, eventually thinking that my messed up brain would sabotage every single good thing in my life, and lead me to be a complete failure. 

That me being an emotional wreck would never grant me stability in my job, that i will never have good & close ties with my family, that my boyfriend will despise me and eventually leave me, that i will never be a good parent to my kids, that i will end up poor, alone and a failure ultimately. 

These thoughts can be all-consuming and literally eat up my will to live in a matter of minutes.

Does anyone resonate with me?"
depression,fpotgrl,t1_fpotble,1588790373.0,"Honestly i have never felt such great pain... i guess it’s highly correlated to your inner pain?

depression,fposuna,t3_genw7o,1588790071.0,"It’s quite common amongst people with depression and anxiety. Be it from the actual chest/heartache from crying too much, or chest tightness and shortness of breath from your emotional pain.

bipolar,fpnae1u,t3_ge3nb9,1588755863.0,"If you feel like there’s no meaning to getting out of bed, or there’s no meaning to anything at all, then it definitely is a sign of depression."

But trust me, there are bad days, but there will definitely have good days as well. Even if the NOW is extremely painful to live in, and your mind is telling you to give up... remember we're all here to remind you not to give in to your mind. 

Also, you have been doing very well in therapy. Recovery is a journey, which means that there are bound to be ups and downs. It doesn't mean that having an episode once again means that your efforts are wasted! Make use of the skills and tricks that your therapist have thought you, though it's difficult, and try to get through this difficult period. 

Soon you'll be back on track and realise that you're actually still on your path of recovery. 

Hope this helps, cheeries. :)"
depression,fpn892z,t3_gefdun,1588753663.0,"""I try to consciously change my thought pattern and... it ignores my efforts."" 

Be kind to yourself. It is a big step to take that you're consciously trying to change your thought patterns, and we all know it is extremely tough to fight against the demon in your mind. 

Take it one step at a time and celebrate the little victories. Celebrate that you're able to get out of bed, wash your clothes, shower, and more. Don't try to aim for the sky when you're already feeling depressed. Love yourself and give yourself a breather, a peace of mind to relax and not do anything. Don't stress it. 

Hope it helps. Cheeries."

Anxiety,fpn7gee,t3_ge56q8,1588752875.0,"Actually it is common for people with anxiety to have diarrhoea as a side effect. This is the works of a dysregulated gut-brain axis (our stomach and brains are highly linked!). That’s why many of us with anxiety tend to also have IBS. 

Caffeine does have a strong effect in making us jittery and anxious, but it does not cause anxiety disorder. That’s because consuming caffeine causes us to produce lots of cortisol (stress hormone) which causes us to be anxious/jittery, thereby through the works of the gut-brain axis, speeds up our digestive system and induces diarrhoea. 

Hope it helps!"

depression,fpmzc3g,t1_fpmvgmr,1588745710.0,"How are you currently feeling? Is it because of the covid quarentine or you have been dealing with depression for some time?

One thing i learned which helped me tremendously was to celebrate and pat yourself on the back for even the smallest achievements in the day. To get up and shower, do your laundry, cook a meal - these may seem basic in the eyes of others but for people who’re in a depressive episode, the mental barrier is huge... so by being grateful to yourself for achieving the small things, made a huge difference to my recovery. 

I hope this helps you too. We’re in this together."

mentalhealth,fpmvdkn,t3_ge21ur,1588742766.0,"Super proud of you, this is actually wonderfully impressive and inspirational to the community. Keep it up. I think you're already exceeding your own expectations in general :)

It's hard for mentally strong/healthy people to understand the struggles of people with depression. I always advocate that we celebrate the little victories we have in our present moment. To be able to wake up in the morning and get changed; to brush our teeth and do our laundries. It's okay to stumble and dip once in a while, and we have to compassionate to ourselves. 

These little victories will eventually add up to our 'heart wallet' and it's important to recognise that no matter how small your achievements may be, they're meaningful in the grand scheme of recovery. 

All the best! Cheeries."
mentalhealth,fpmuzxm,t3_ge1dz0,1588742464.0,"Same thoughts as you. 

For people who are already suffering from depression, this show may have just shoved them to doing something devastating. Giving them the idea of committing suicide (ie. how Hannah died) as a form of escaping the pain, and a meaning for them to do so (to incite regrets and guilt amongst people who may have directly/indirectly led them to their eventual decision). 

Terrible for people who are already suffering from mental health issues in general. 

I would rather have a show where it shows how a person recovers from depression instead."
depression,fpmta5k,t3_ge1da5,1588741136.0,"You're not unlovable, there is ALWAYS something about everyone that people would appreciate. Don't be afraid to make new friends or meet new lovers, as building good relationships is one of the fundamentals of becoming happy and finding contentment.

It's good that you're in a virtual community like Reddit where you have people to at least socialize with. It's important during this depressing period where we're all trapped within the confinements of the four grey walls.

Start small, maybe you can try to be there for others in Reddit, learn to be kind to others (even though it may be hard to believe it yourself)? It can be a really revelational concept and you'll learn a lot from it.

Also, maybe you can start on a new hobby - knitting, painting, drawing, sewing, cooking etc. Try something new, out of your comfort zone. Trust me, it's the little things, the little achievements that would add to your heart wallet, and slowly but gradually, you'll be in a better state.

I hope you feel better and you're on a good journey towards recovery.

One of the main pillars to becoming contented and happy is to strive to build strong, meaningful relationships with people (your SO, friends and family). This doesn't require you to be best friends with anyone, but you will realise in the long run that these great relationships you built over the years count so much more than just simply having a best friend!

depression,fpmre0c,t1_fpiq3pi,1588739734.0,"I understand that it is a difficult time for you now, and it feels like an endless hole you feel incapable of climbing out of. Things seem bleak and hopeless, and you're wondering if things will ever get better.

  
I have been in a similar situation before, and I still struggle from time to time regarding these thoughts, even though I may be in a better place than before.   


Have you considered therapy? Having someone to speak to, and learning essential skills to cope with your state of mind is life-changing. 

  
Do you know what are your heart's desires, or your passion? Consider doing some volunteering work or blogging/journalling in your field of interest. Doing things that you truly find meaning in, is a highly therapeutic thing, and it will help you with your issue with negativity and pessimism. Also, maybe you can start new hobbies that you've always wanted to do - perhaps art, knitting or sewing. I'm sure there is something that you can do during this period, which will keep you productive and fulfilled.

Take note of every small achievement and pat yourself on your back for these, as it is the small things that would add up to your journey to recovery.  Be your own cheerleader.

Celebrate your little wins and it will really make a difference :) All the best."
