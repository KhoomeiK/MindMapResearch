depression_help,fojw3n0,t3_g7v5rm,1587830591.0,"I’m so sorry you’re feeling like this and that you were given isn’t what you want you want for yourself.

I’m on a similar boat trying to love myself. It’s so hard and I still haven’t found a way to fix it or to solve it. Everyone says it as if it’s a piece of cake and I see a lot of people loving themselves which makes me envious. And being envious is not good.

I wish I had some advice on how to do it, but I haven’t been able to do it so I wouldn’t trust myself honestly. But what I will say is that I think there’s a point when we need to take it seriously and take the steps necessary. Yes, it’s annoying and takes time and it’s hard, but it’s necessary and we need to stop our victimization. I hate saying that, but it’s the truth. It’s hard for me to accept that path as well. Think about it, there’s people that might be worse than you and yet still have a happy life and have an attractive partner somehow. They get what they want by just being nice and fun people to be around with.

Because I’ve been focusing on all the negatives stuff about me, I’ve dug myself a hole I can’t get out of anymore. I have nothing important or fun to say I’m conversations. I only talk about how sad everything is and how I don’t like me or anything in the world. Unfortunately, even though it sucks, people get turned off by it. It’s sad because we need people to be empathetic and show us how important we are, but no one will, because they are too busy making themselves important too. Therefore, we have to find that thing that we love about ourselves and be compassionate to ourselves. We need to learn to be that best friend to ourselves that says “you’re amazing and so attractive, I don’t care what anyone says.” We need to be the voice that stands up for ourselves and forgives us for the things we do or can’t change. And maybe then we will have the motivation to change some things for ourselves, like go to the gym, learn to cook, learn new hobbies to talk about with people, change our fashion style, whiten our teeth, use cologne, trim the beard more often, learn to laugh and make jokes, etc. Learn to be okay and chill as opposed to negative and insecure.

It’s sad that we are given a harder mental card to deal with than some other people, but it means that we have to do the job anyways and we need to find a different meaning to life than just superficial things. There’s tons of un attractive people out there and they found a way, so we should be able to do it as well.

Im sending you positive vibes and energy, my friend. You are worth the time and space and energy. Please remember that. Hopefully we can achieve this and learn and hopefully share knowledge with people in similar struggles in the future. You deserve a good chance at life, no matter what you look like or think like. You’re allowed to have a good opportunity to grow and be happy. Be compassionate and forgive yourself and try to be your own best friend, the one who defends you and lifts you up. The one that would never leave your side and would never harm you. You know? Just like you would be to your best friend, too. Be to yourself what you would be to other people. You count as well. You are your priority."

After being invalidated for so long, I chose to play it safe and be kind and be what people wanted me to be and that got me used to never putting some boundaries. It feels like my life is ending whenever I take a risky decision.

Reading your knowledge helps me a lot because you explained it very well and I think this will help me rationalize a lot and give a push to keep trying to make decisions. I never thought anyone would respond to my post and I’m glad you did.

Lately I’ve been making progress and I’m really proud of myself for that. I’m taking the time to not react and just set my boundaries and forget about what people might think of my actions.

I wish there were more people explaining in depth these kinds of issues a lot of people face, but I also understand it’s hard to put it in words. I just think people struggle because they don’t have the guidance of someone who is self aware and knows how to communicate, so everything falls short or ends up being vague. However, the intentions are there so it should always be appreciated regardless.

I think you hit the points I was asking you about and I’m grateful for that. I struggle with just having the confidence to know that my actions and instincts are absolute to myself. I always doubt about my decisions and whether or not they really are right, so it takes me down a spiral I don’t like to go down on. But it helps me to know what kind of strategies people do to deal with these situations, it gives me a sense of relief that it’s okay to be strict and believe in yourself.

I was never taught self confidence or self love growing up. In the contrary, I was always questioned and invalidated by everyone in my family, so it’s hard for me to consider my decisions the right ones. I’m trying really hard to change that so I stop caring about trusting other people and just enjoy the moments.

I think your perspective is really interesting. I do have intuition, which is why I’m able to tell these things, I just like giving people the chance to explain themselves and explain their reasoning to why they do why they do, but no one really likes to explain with honesty and most people don’t realize how they come across is important to how things go. It also seems like people just don’t get how communication works and how to analyze situations from different perspectives.

Do you think I should just trust my instinct and not give anyone a second chance and just take it as it is? Is that what you do? What if it’s someone who seems trustworthy and then shows their true colors? How do you detach your emotions from that and stop caring? I just feel like if I don’t give people a chance I will become a selfish person, which is the opposite of what I stand for.

mentalhealth,flf37m5,t3_foac5a,1585097046.0,"I mean I had someone yesterday tell me “That’s not me, good luck” to me asking for a little respect.

There is a lot of self centered people out there. It is further magnified by the individualistic culture that some countries have, like the US. Everyone in the US sees you as an object that benefits them and most don’t have genuine interest or compassion. Of course, that’s generalizing, but coming from someone who has dealt with a lot of that coming from a team/group oriented culture (South America).

I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. No one should. And you’re right, we are worthy of love and respect and attention, but those people are NOT. So let’s work on not giving to them and giving it to people who are worth it.

A lot of people who think the same way will tell you to stop caring about others and just care about yourself, but I see that as a toxic idea, since that doesn’t fix the problem of selfishness I’m the world, it just makes it worse since you’d be adding to it and becoming what you hate. So, focus on finding the few people that think like you  and me. Care about people, but also learn to be on your own, because you’ll be on your own a lot of times. Not because you like it, but because other people suck and that’s inevitable. I am working on these things as well. Like I told you, I’ve dealt with a good amount of people like that one after another. The only fix is to cry, get up, and move on, as sad as it sounds. Easier said than done for sure. You will find people who will use you and will admit to it as if it’s normal, and there’s nothing you can do because no one else will understand how awful that is for someone to do. People will just tell you to move on, but it’s not that simple. However, it does need to be done eventually at your own pace of realization.

My feeling of loneliness is always on 24/7, and it’s so hard to shake off, meaning that it always affects my decisions and how I see the world. I try to cancel it out, but it’s almost impossible. I’ve been “forcing” myself to be alone for a few days in a row (thanks, corona), and every day becomes a little bit easier. That’s giving me a little bit of hope.

How about you take some time to just worry about yourself and only have yourself to rely on? Try to improve your life from zero. Don’t seek relationships or friendships, just start out alone and learn to depend only on yourself and form there on you can add people once you feel like you have built some strong base for yourself to never let anyone else waste your time.
