gay,esas3w2,t1_esarb2q,1561767212.0,"I do get where you're coming from.
I'm only 20 - never been in a serious relationship so I don't really know how it works. I'm a very private person, I think that's more personality than age though."
gay,esarwml,t1_esari1u,1561767043.0,"That would imply that sex is the only factor. Dating a guy doesn't imply that you'll have a specific type of sex. Although, I'd choose tennis over soccer any day lol.
I agree with you that sooner is better. However, too soon might scare a guy off who wouldn't be too bothered after several dates - although I don't think deception is the best idea. I mean, someone wouldn't tell someone about their scat fetish on the first date lmao."
gay,esarb01,t1_esar662,1561766541.0,"In that case I 100% agree. What I meant was not disclosing immediately... maybe after a few dates.
Sorry for the misunderstanding."
gay,esaqmri,t1_esapgop,1561766018.0,"I can see where you're coming from.

However, I don't think a sexual preference (because that's what it is) is something you're obliged to tell someone at first anyway. If it were the other way around and you didn't like blowjobs and only anal, would you tell them immediately? 

I do agree with you that they have no obligation to accept it. Equally, I'm under no obligation to tell them until it comes down to us having sex unless he asks me before.  I'd just like to think that there are guys out there who are not shallow pricks and only care about one sex act. If I were not sexual at all, that would be a different story.

I would say that it's important, but not as important as you're emphasising it to be. Ultimately, as I said before, it is just a sexual preference."
worldpolitics,es1lqsx,t1_es1atqz,1561499767.0,Thank you! Feel free to ask more questions.
worldpolitics,es1lm82,t1_es1fhm3,1561499681.0,"That's a very difficult question.

My first point is that Israelis aren't a hive mind. It's the only democracy in the Middle East and everyone has different opinions on everything - including Trump.

What you have to understand is that there are three main Jewish groups in Israel (the ultra-Orthodox, the moderately religious, and the secular), in addition to the Israeli-Arabs.

The secular people (who are the ones I mainly socialise with), usually have standard variation in political views. The religious tend to be more supportive of Netanyahu than the secular Israelis. Netanyahu is a bit of a marmite figure in Israel – you either love him or hate him.

Many Israelis who like Trump simply like him because he is pro-Israel, not for his other policies. I have spoken to many otherwise left-wing people in Israel who like Trump simply for his pro-Israel policies.

My closest friend in Israel, for instance, votes Meretz (yuck – thankfully he only supports them for their pro-gay policies and economic policies) yet loves Trump due to his pro-Israel policies. His sister thinks he’s a sexist asshole. His parents have mixed views on him.

The most pro-Trump person I met in Israel was an ultra-Orthodox woman I talked to at a bus stop. She was from a small Israeli town in the West Bank (a “settlement”) and loved Trump and all of his policies. Despite her right-wing views, she didn’t speak about the Palestinians in a rude manner. She told me how they work in her town and cause no issues whatsoever. She wouldn’t even object to them getting a state so long as no one is displaced and the terror stops.

The most anti-Trump person I met in Israel was a gay guy I had drinks with. He voted Meretz and believed in all of their policies and described Trump as a “fascist”.

Trump is very good for Israel, so I don’t blame Israelis for liking him as it really is in their own best interests.  

From personal experience, I’d say that Israeli opinion of Trump is generally positive, but the reasons behind it vary. The people I hang out with in Israel usually happened to be left-wing (despite me being centre-right), so my perception of Israeli opinion is a bit different. Some simply like him for being pro-Israel, some like him for his other policies.

Israel is no more of a hive mind than the US/UK – opinions on everything vary from person-to-person."
worldpolitics,es19g4r,t1_es180ck,1561491955.0,"I can tell you for a fact that the media completely sensationalises everything regarding Israel. I've been to Jerusalem, Druze and Arab villages, Nazareth, Akko etc countless times. I've been in many Arab restaurants with my friend who is an Israeli Jew. Very seldom did I sense any atmosphere. The Arab market in Jerusalem is a prime example of this. There were Palestine flags and t-shirts in shops... yet hundreds of Israelis and tourists walking about. My friend and I sat were even invited into an Israeli-Jordanian Arab man's shop and given coffee and food - despite my friend being blatantly Israeli-Jewish. I'm actually convinced that the Arabs in the markets do not care either way about the conflict and are just making money off gullible tourists - there were even IDF t-shirts in the same shop as Palestine magnets! Israeli-Arabs mostly coexist with Jews well - some mind their own business in their own villages, some work and live alongside Jews with no issues.

I don't believe that the political turmoil is as bad as the news makes it out to be. I haven't been near Gaza to be able to tell. However, the media lies a lot and sensationalises things. For instance, the ""innocent Palestinians"" shot at the border were attempting to breach the border fence. I highly doubt they were breaching it just to ""march"" - they were breaching the fence in order to murder innocent Israelis under the instructions of Hamas. I recommend that you check Israeli news for a more unbiased perspective (unlike in other situations, the Israeli news reports the facts more accurately) - even the left wing papers like Ha'aretz. 

The smell depends on where you go. I guess it just smells like a warm Britain lol."
mentalhealth,es16fa0,t1_erykuak,1561490140.0,I'd be angry at that. I honestly don't blame the psychiatrist for being angry - there's no justification for such evil manipulation.
mentalhealth,es16ak8,t1_eryiuwi,1561490062.0,"When you say you have manias – how long do they last? Many with BPD and “Bipolar” are diagnosed with things like “mixed” or “rapid cycling” (episodes way too short to be down to rapid cycling). Makes me very sceptical of their bipolarity – not that I’m saying you don’t have bipolar as it does happen sometimes.

All of that may be true, but it really isn’t an excuse to deliberately inflict pain and suffering on others in an almost psychopathic way in order to gain attention. I’d argue that a lot of the time, they aren’t out of control and they aren’t even in crisis – they just want attention and would do anything to get it. Smirking and laughing isn’t usually associated with being genuinely suicidal and a genuinely suicidal person wouldn’t do something they know won’t kill them and tell everyone about it – a suicidal person suffers in silence and when the suicide happens, they’re silent about it.

Thank you for not being angry and discussing this in a civilised manner.

See my other reply for my argument about BPD not being a real mental disorder. I agree with you that BPD is more environmental and Bipolar more neurological. However, we could make all of the same arguments about psychopaths – does that justify their disgraceful behaviours. Frankly, I could care less what they’re going through after the way the CHOSE to treat me – I should have just ignored it and told them to fuck off rather than trying to be a nice caring person. Giving them attention just makes them more likely to to it in the future. Perhaps if I’d walked away at the first sign of toxicity, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. None of them expressed any guilt for their behaviour, not even a single apology.  

“Quiet BPD” - that’s very interesting. I know many people with Bipolar who have been told that they have traits of BPD and they’re honestly some of the most amazing people I have ever met. I always assumed it was a misdiagnosis (there’s no way they have BPD), but now that you mention it – maybe I’ve been associating BPD with the extreme end of the spectrum and simply not believing that the nice people with BPD TRAITS are simply “too nice to be BPD”. I would like to shift these views, but I find it difficult to after such horrific experiences. That’s certainly food for thought.

The majority of people with BPD who I have met have been young girls under 30 from hospital. Obviously these people are going to be more extreme. I know one girl who is 30 from hospital, and she was still a bit of an attention-seeker, but mostly harmless in terms of harming other people and was otherwise lovely. She also had Bipolar I. I’d imagine that she’s matured a lot and is therefore less extreme in her behaviours. I have heard many say that BPD is something one can “grow out of” to a degree. On the other side of the coin, the fact that it can improve without medication would infer to me that there’s definitely a big behavioural element to it. I’d describe BPD as “16 year-old girl syndrome” (to the extreme) and the traits are often due to a high degree of immaturity due to being deprived the opportunity to mature in childhood.  

It does piss me off as I feel as if it is a complete mockery of the suffering we go through. The two illnesses are so different. The underlying cause and presentation are completely different. It does irritate me how bipolar is romanticised so much. I can’t think of a more horrible illness, I hate every part of it – from mania to depression. The creativity thing is nonsense too – there is nothing good about it.

I’d disagree with that. In the past, sure. However, now that mental illness is more romanticised, people tend to care too much about the BPD person than the person who is victim to their evil stunts. I did visit it, and I agree with most of the posts and can relate to them.

As I said to the other guy, I disagree with most of your points, but it certainly gave me some interesting food for thought, so thank you."
mentalhealth,es12l8b,t1_eryh0vb,1561487911.0,"Firstly, thank you for your respectful, detailed and logical response. I don't blame you for doubting your diagnosis - most borderlines would have started shouting and throwing tantrums by this point.

I will admit that the people I met directly are probably on the more extreme side of the spectrum. After all, I did meet them in hospital. What I will say is that when they were behaving like how they behaved, they appeared to be enjoying it (smirking between crocodile tears, trying not to laugh etc) and showed no remorse afterwards. The only person who ever gave me an apology was the second girl and it only happened like 5-10% of the times she treated me like shit and I suspect it was an attempt to stop me from abandoning her and not a genuine apology. I would argue that many borderlines aren't necessarily distressed when pulling attention-seeking stunts, but rather they are simply looking for attention and faking their distress. Obviously this is only speculation based on the many experiences I've had with them and their bullshit and this is a generalisation too.

In my opinion, there is a degree of stigma - but it exists for a reason. Fully qualified medical professionals would not make assumptions if they didn't have pretty good reason to do so. With the way that many of them behave (a lot of which is behavioural from some people's perspectives), I'm really not surprised that there is a stigma attached.

Admittedly I wouldn't particularly like that - you've certainly given me food for thought. Although, I would argue that Bipolar episodes are an altered mental state due to a severe chemical imbalance in the brain - we aren't really the same people as we are during periods of stability. When people with BPD kick off, this is actually the true them and part of their personality. People with BPD do not have ""episodes"" like in Bipolar. It is ultimately their personality being expressed more under times of stress or boredom. The difference is that BPD is mostly behavioural - they make conscious choices to behave in a particular way - and Bipolar episodes are a direct result of an altered mental state (like in people with schizophrenia etc) - we do not choose to behave in such a way, rather our brain chemicals dictate this for us. 

Although, what I will say, is that I don't like using my Bipolar as an excuse for everything. If I've wronged someone, I show remorse and apologise. I've yet to receive an apology from any of the people with BPD who wronged me. It's rotten what happened to you in hospital, and is certainly interesting food for thought again. The second girl seems more BPD to me - most people with Bipolar hate being in hospital and people with BPD are usually the ones who love it (I even knew a girl who had ""planned admissions"" and posted on Facebook how happy she was to be in - one of the most BPD people I have ever met).

I'd dispute the argument that BPD is a mental disorder. From my perspective, it is just giving people an excuse for their behaviour by making it into a medical problem.

I mostly disagree with you, but you've certainly given me a different perspective and I really respect and appreciate that.  
Thanks again."
mentalhealth,erym2oz,t3_c4u2je,1561411685.0,I will get back to you properly tomorrow - I'm very sleepy and feel as if this needs a proper response. Same regarding the other person's response. Goodnight

mentalhealth,eryh5b0,t3_c4un9l,1561408431.0,"Ah, I'd recommend withdrawing each one slowly if you're coming off them. Do you have bipolar, schizoaffective or psychotic depression? Why are you one two antipsychotics at once? I'm on Abilify, Seroquel, Lithium and Lamictal at the moment, but I was under the impression that two antipsychotics is usually only given in extreme cases. If you're so severe that you require two antipsychotics, I definitely wouldn't recommend coming off them. Best of luck."

I'd also like to see you provide more detail on your claim that BPD is not an awful personality made into a medical condition."
mentalhealth,eryfzvn,t3_c4i02g,1561407697.0,"I am diagnosed with Bipolar I and Asperger's, and I agree TO A DEGREE.

It's a very good idea in principle, but the number of people who would abuse it is unreal.

Firstly, people with personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder would abuse the hypothetical service in order to gain attention. From various hospitalisations, I know many people like this. They'll overdose on things like 8 paracetamol to get into A&E. They'll flush say, 40 tablets, down the toilet, take ten and then say they've taken all 50. You get people who self harm superficially and go into A&E to get checked so they'll get attention. In such a service, specifically aimed at helping mental health, the proportion of attention-seekers would be awful. It would ruin the service for people genuinely in need - which is a total shame but is the harsh reality. Said service would have to be very picky as to who receives treatment (e.g. those in absolute crisis). Unfortunately, the loud ones are the ones who usually receive the treatment and the ones who suffer in silence are left to get on with it.

Secondly, people who aren't diagnosed with anything would turn up, thinking they're having an acute mental health breakdown when they may just be having a normal bad day, are stressed or even drunk. So many people nowadays think that they have mental health issues when they don't, largely due to the internet labelling everyone who feels as bit sad and nervous from time to time as having depression and anxiety! Again, this would waste resources.

It's a good idea in principle, but I don't think it's very practical. If you're in an absolute emergency, you could have home treatment, be given PRN for emergencies or even be admitted to hospital. I don't think that counselling will help someone in an acute episode avoid a hospital admission - psychology doesn't do anything for severe acute mania, depression or psychosis. Counselling is given during periods of relative remission in order to give people coping strategies and learn them to recognise their warning signs.

Our NHS (in the UK) is already on its knees. It's good to have all these nice ideas... but where's the money coming from. I'd possibly value a cancer patient receiving half-decent treatment over someone getting to see a psychologist on demand.

I think you raised a very valid point, however. The system is very flawed indeed."
