Personally, I can barely make a post without getting anxious, in this sub or outside of it, so I usually never make any. I read some posts here and to be honest, a lot of them makes me feel worse because some people are objectively much worse off than I am. But nobody should tell anyone that they should not be depressed because there are people who have it worse so I try to disregard the feelings I get. Because if that were true, then nobody would be allowed to be depressed except for the one person who has nobody who has it worse than them. If we feel bad then we feel bad and that's okay. Many years ago I was really suicidal but now I just get these urges to give up and stuff from time to time. And I can't really do that so I try to take care of myself, but sometimes it just feels like I'm going through the motions of things that I should do. Like showering, eating and getting enough sleep.

Anxiety does play a large part in me being that way, but I do go to therapy and am working on that. And I really appreciate how this comment chain turned out. Talking with people on this site when you're like me is like walking on a mine field and I have had some really bad encounters on this site, probably because of how many users it has and that you will eventually run into people who vent their anger from other things in their life and stuff, which I definitely can relate to. Because I can admit that I have done this myself. So I try not to judge people too much since we're all just human. *(Except for that totallynotrobots sub.

The amount you would need to clean afterwards would vary a whole lot as well. But the more difficult job would also be the more deserved and funny one, if you catch my drift.

One where I slide around in a small electric vehicle on oily steel plates, claiming that ""The Fast And The Furious, Tokyo Drift"" is loosely based on my life and another where I've cut holes in a box for my arms, legs and head, jumping around like a frog while wearing it, only to then get my foot caught in my dogs water bowl, forcing me to use my ""a-cable-is-caught-in-my-foot-reflex"" and just sort of give up on progressing towards the living room. So it's probably not the kind of content you would expect me to make, judging from the comment I just made.  


I would absolutely recommend Exurb1a, my favourite Youtuber, if you would like to kill some time. That guy is insane in the most perfect way possible and his content is prone to cause me to have minor to major feelings of existential dread while also being very comforting in a way. I'm not suitable to accurately describe it as you probably have to experience it yourself to get a feeling of what I'm getting at.  


""Infinite rice pudding"", ""Misery was"" and ""Bear and Goose at the end of everything"" are some of my favourites. Just hit those up in the Youtube search bar if you want to watch them. I would link them, but Reddit has a tendency to remove comments with links in them for some reason.

That's 900 slices over an area of 282743 square meters (That's about 927635 square feet, for you people who still insist on using those drunken sailor units of measurements) which would mean about one slice of cake per 314 square meters (1017 square footsies), and given the current situation with the world and social distancing and all that, then that means you can have 900 people on your cakeday, spread out at an extremely safe distance, celebrating. And you can have even more people if you decide to make smaller slices.

It's just the safest way to celebrate your cakeday. And using a catapult for the same task would not be a safe distance at all as you would just have to pack people in like sardines to reach them. What's the effective range of those things again? 20 meter? 30? I don't know and I don't care. Eating cake that has touched one of those rusty spoon flingers would probably give you something worse than COVID-19 anyways so I wouldn't risk it.

*Disclaimer: 100 gram cake slices would fly much further than a 90 kilogram cake would per launch. So the range can effectively be multiplied by a factor of ""holy crap!"" if you decide to launch them individually, given the case that you don't have 900 people within your circle of effective range if you decide to launch the whole thing at once.*"

Cognitive behaviour therapy has helped me a bunch as well but I'm far from cured. But I'm not apathetic anymore, but instead have become a blubbering mess that cries for almost nothing. It's really weird... I wish I could talk more openly about how I feel but I'm not even sure of how I feel as I have been disregarding my feelings for such a long time to just do what has to be done to not ruin my life I guess. I honestly don't even know if that's the case. The truth is that I don't know why I am this way and I have been trying to find out for over half my life now as I have been depressed since my teens and am now over thirty years old. Recently, my appetite has improved and I now eat because I'm hungry, not simply because I should. That is definitely improvement.

Sorry for veering off topic or whatever. I guess I'm sort of venting a bit with this comment. But as this sub is a support group, I hope this is fine."

It pretty much looks like Monkey Island 2."

A long time ago when I moved out from an ex because of oh so many reasons, I called them and told them that I wanted it shut off and would not mind paying the rest of my subscription fee, which was three months. They shut it off that day and told me I would not have to pay them the rest I owed and hoped I would choose them again when I got a new place."

But due to how water flows, it will continue to get more and more zig-zaggy (English is my second language, so I'm sorry if there is a better description) over time. When water flows through it, it presses harder against the sides and makes the shape more prominent.  


I once saw a Youtube video about rivers and why they are shaped like they are, so don't worry. I'm definitely an expert on this. 😂"

depression,f3funei,t3_dgukqj,1570902937.0,"It seems to me like people who reason like that think that depression = sad. I'm leaning towards that if disappointment was a pokémon, depression would be the evolved form and apathy the final one. Personally, I disregard my own feelings and constantly try to not get my hopes up. ""*I'd rather be positively surprised than disappointed that I was wrong.""* is something I tell myself all the time to try and justify my negative view. But life made me this way and I'm simply a sum of all my events I guess... Or do I have any actual power over how I feel? I know that if I get my hopes up and things go south, it basically crushes me and ruins my day. But hoping for something and getting it makes it so much more sweet in the end. You got it and you were right. That's a positive experience that will help to balance the negative ones you've had that *partially* is keeping you in a depressed state.  


You have x, y or z so you should be happy is just the wrong way of reasoning in my book. Getting told you should not feel like shit because someone else has it worse only makes you feel more like shit. But remember who told you that and if they ever loose a finger or something, quickly point out that others has lost entire hands or limbs and they should be happy about what they have and they will probably be rightfully pissed off at you (Don't actually do this). So I think it's partially okay to be pissed off at a person who think they can simply tell you that you should feel better than you do. Your experience is subjective to you and if you *feel* a certain way then that is simply how you feel.  


I hope that makes sense... I'm way better at thinking than I am at explaining things."
