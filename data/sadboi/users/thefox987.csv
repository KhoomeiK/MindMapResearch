Here's my theory our main goal is to reproduce giving us drive to improve to get the best mate for the best offspring. Through these websites when we PMO we basically tell our brain your job is done you are Alpha your are the man, so you dont improve you dont have to your brain think I am able to reproduce with this beauty I am clearly the best. When you remove this from the equation your brain goes into a fight mode it thinks i must be better or else i will not pass on my genes I will die and it will end with me. So it's basically thinking I will die and my information will not pass on. So what does it do I must be better how does it do that it makes you more competitive it makes you a better you cause if it dont you will not do the basic thing of passing on your genes.
What's this got to do with prematura or semen retention it's the same thing I mentioned that I saw Captian Sinbad talk about it now I dont remember every part but it mentioned if I'm not mistaken, that the person that practices abstinence would become the most powerful the side affect is anger however. I will put a link [here](https://youtu.be/w4kdflN67Pc)"
