EDAnonymous,fna05ks,t3_g0hxrv,1586788427.0,"I think it’s worth noting that it’s hard to be triggered when you’re already in the depths of your ED. Usually the triggers come when you’re trying to make recovery-oriented improvements and, once you’re triggered, you end up falling backward. If you haven’t made those steps (even tiny harm reduction ones like “I’m going to eat an extra apple today” or whatever) toward recovery, there’s not really much more backward you can go."
intuitiveeating,fn9zgja,t3_g0jt1e,1586788018.0,"I think one of the general ideas of HAES is that you’re loving yourself by respecting your body and the fact that weight is not an indicator of health. 

I believe there are less healthy eating habits and that it’s not black and white but other, more health-impacting, things play into those behaviors like stress and poverty. I think it’s more loving to have compassion for yourself in those areas than it would be to focus on a physical consequence that isn’t correlated with and doesn’t cause your health outcomes. 

Saying that you love yourself ENOUGH to lose weight still implies that being at any certain weight is inherently bad for you when that part isn’t true."

EDAnonymous,flckv29,t3_fnq1j2,1585034919.0,"You’re really not alone in these feelings. I always get irritated when people flip the perspective like this for me but:

loads of us are relapsing right now, I’m seeing it everywhere and experiencing it myself, and I bet a lot of people feel the same way about it being a sign that now is not the time for recovery. 

However, I doubt you would still say that or believe that if we were talking about someone else. 

Plus, with a pandemic it is actually safest to practice the best recovery methods you can because you need your immune system to be at its best to get through this. 

Regardless of all that, you fr aren’t alone and I am so sorry you’re struggling. You’re so not alone."
fuckeatingdisorders,flck3o8,t3_fnu70c,1585034008.0,"Based on the struggles you talk about here I’d definitely support recovery <3 

I highly recommend Sick Enough by Jennifer Gaudiani, MD. It’s a book written to talk about and explain the medical complications and physical repercussions of EDs. It may explain the bloating and distortions a bit. Good luck, you’re not alone!"

EDAnonymous,flcius0,t3_fnoi0o,1585032567.0,He sounds ignorant and his beliefs and practice is dangerous. I def encourage you to seek out a specialist’s opinion or really just anyone else.
EDAnonymous,flcis3c,t1_flbr3fk,1585032486.0,"Yep. It can range from “wow this is terrible” to dangerous. I think the period of time you consume the beverages in is relevant bc a thousand mg of caffeine in one hour is different than a thousand over the day. 

I think it’s still not ideal all day, but I know if I consume more than 350mg of caffeine in a sitting, and I have certainly more than tripled that in a sitting, that I’ll get the shits, shake, hear my heartbeat, sometimes vomit and sometimes faint. I may be on the sensitive side but it’s def a thing and it can be deadly so be safe out there!!"
EDAnonymous,flchwsg,t3_fns8cy,1585031515.0,"I felt this way until I went to therapy. I don’t think most people start out seeing it as something separate. The personification is actually used as a therapeutic tool to help treat and understand the ED.

Also, as a lesbian who was once afraid to get a strap on because I was afraid that meant my partner wanted an actual penis, I can assure you that a strap on will only add something to the mix of things you do and keep it exciting. Your fears are valid but odds are, if she's into it, you'll both find ways to enjoy it. 

Good luck, OP!"

Shit, I was at my older brother’s the other day and he “jokingly” had to go weigh himself 4 times while I was there. 

I used to talk to my grandma on the phone as a little girl and every day she would list what she ate that day. It was the same thing every day and let’s just say it was a VERY low cal diet. 

Insane. Like is it even genetic or did she teach it to all of us? lol"

EatingDisorders,fkjvfu3,t1_fki5muq,1584261482.0,"For mine they both made meals, ordered out, took us out, and taught us how to prepare our own. 

There wasn’t a psychiatrist at that level of care with this facility. Just a therapist and dietitian unfortunately. 

I also felt I needed much more ongoing support, and honestly I did, but I tried to accept things for what they were and gave the EIOP everything I could. It provided a LOT of great ongoing support. It depends on the program, but I went in kicking and screaming and then cried for 3 days after leaving. I still feel a bit short-changed because I really did need the higher level of care but you may thrive in this program or you may prove you need more care. It will all work out in the end."
omad,fkgj5os,t1_fkfnesb,1584161426.0,Not really meaning to imply fasting can cause an ED as much as it can trigger/reveal stuff that’s already going on. It’s a major red flag imo. 🤷‍♀️

I literally had to go to the bathroom to cry about it for a minute before going back to the show totally numbed out. Thinking about that picture was the driving force behind sooooo many terrible things.

I'm glad to be on the other side of that. I'm sorry you're experiencing this! I don't have a great solution other than to ask yourself in what ways your insides are more important than your appearance, ask yourself how you can be more self-compassionate, and maybe begin collecting some affirmations to tell yourself and hang onto."
