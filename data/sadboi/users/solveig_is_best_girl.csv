WarplanePorn,fameogy,t3_e97nk2,1576202050.0,"This looks like the ending of a gritty, realistic, and emotional modern war sim game that shows the story of 5 Soldiers who create a strong emotional bond through time and end up becoming brothers in arms but get captured by enemy forces and brought to a heavily fortified enemy stronghold and together they have to escape, with each of them playing an essential role in escaping. Along the way they uncover massive plans for an enemy operation against the US and find a way to contact a nearby US air base and give them coordinates to the stronghold to destroy it, however, they have a select amount of time before the stronghold gets destroyed with them in it. Before they escape they also now have to disable the stronghold’s anti air defences, after many close encounters and traumatising events and scenes, they escape together right before the US airforce shows up and dispatches of the stronghold. The 5 brothers celebrate and get Honourably Discharged and rewarded Distinguished Service Crosses. They return to civilian life but have trouble readjusting but despite that they all start families and live out the rest of their lives."
