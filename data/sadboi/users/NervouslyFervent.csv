 wild on acid. Even better on dmt.

Veteren is his 2018 album that got him alot of praise.

He realsed 'all my heroes are cornballs' last year which has a more chill vibe but is definitely still experimental and weird.

Lots of video game references and sound effects. Most of his tracks have dozens of samples  that are like layered in top of 3ach other and then ran through compression, distortion, reverb ect. It's nuts. I'm still finding random samples all the time. 


> EARTHGANG. 

They just have a general psychdelic vibe. RAGS EP imo is their best project. 


> Madlib/quasimoto 

It's the same guy just different names he uses. He's produced some of the most critically acclaimed hip hop albums ever made working with the likes of MF DOOM and Jaydilla. His beat tapes are great to listen to if you wanna vibe. 

I'd recommend. 'The Further Adventures of Lord Quas' instrumentals."
