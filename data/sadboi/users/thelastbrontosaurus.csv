This is what a brain looks like when manic, rushing thoughts and ideas, and just a mess in general, but there is something so beautiful about that chaos.

I love it! Keep it up :)"

BecomingTheIceman,fooab07,t1_fon3ks0,1587935477.0,"I feel I had a mental breakthrough and I am still cultivating it and trying to grasp what that was and what I learned from it.

My life will definitely change after this, I learned so much about myself and how my brain works. I feel like if you don’t “remind yourself” of that experience and think about it you would lose it and forget about it. So now every time I meditate I reflect on that exact experience and just makes me so happy and calm.

Happy cake day!"
BecomingTheIceman,foo9vtu,t1_fondjec,1587935270.0,"Mania is when you are so happy that you become destructive.

I am working full time as an IT consultant, I call my friends and family regularly these days, I eat well, do not drink/smoke, and sleep 8 hours every night. I am a functional hypomanic. Mania is when you get so caught up in your projects that you don’t sleep and don’t take care of yourself. And I go to therapy as well every two weeks. Don’t worry guys :) I appreciate it that you care 💜"

I edited the post and summarized my story :)"

bipolar,fly0ess,t1_flxxghq,1585593237.0,">I am in no way saying you should stop your medication and challenge your mind. But the medication is like a hard manual way of controlling your brain chemistry. The reason why people should take their medication is because ""normal"" people have that balance by design, if you have a mental illness you probably don't, so you are being medicated just to have a brain that lacks no other chemicals."
