JoeRogan,fr6a4e8,t1_fqolvwg,1589922591.0,You sound like that news lady in the UK who debated Jordan Peterson.
JoeRogan,fr69zmd,t3_gjtpz0,1589922522.0,"I love Joe Rogan’s comedy.  I’m a huge fan as well.  I used to listen to his podcast religiously.  Now I watch some interesting YouTube clips and sometimes full podcasts of guests that I find interesting.  

He just repeats a lot the same stuff and DOES seem really out of touch.  He also has a blind spot when it comes to issues he’s REALLY passionate about.  He argued with Crowder (a complete douchebag who I can’t stand) about weed and wouldn’t even consider that there might be adverse health affects to it.

Also he’s completely lost touch with his fan base when it comes to understanding that most people aren’t rich and can’t relate to a lot of the shit he talks about...like being able to take up a hobby anytime he wants and spend as much time as he wants working on it.  I’m not trying to say that he should try to connect with us working class people.  In fact, At first I found it inspirational that he has accomplished so much and has so much to show for it.  But...it’s getting old being constantly reminded that I’m never going to have anything anywhere near what he has.  The COVID-19 testing was the first time it crossed from being mildly annoying to infuriating.  I mean...you’re bragging about the fact you have a doctor on your payroll and can get tests as much as you want.  Come ooooon, dude.  Seriously?  Do you ONLY want your rich friends to listen to you?

BUT...I really can’t judge him too harshly at the end of the day.  Not by any means.  If I were in his shoes, I would probably sell out, make as much money as quickly as I can and lose touch so quick that everyone would hate me within a year.  I think he’s a really solid dude and I have nothing but admiration and respect for him.  He lives in a bubble, though, and the effect of that is REALLY starting to show.

I still love his comedy though.  He’s a funny motherfucker."

The amount I’m investing every time is the same.  I have made enough doing this to where if I put that amount in the next dip when it inevitably goes back down to around $8,500, maybe it’ll keep dropping to zero but I’ll still have broken even overall in the little game I’m playing with BTC.

You have an emotional attachment to your hard earned money and it’s very easy to get greedy.  It’s really hard to sell at your stop loss and it’s really hard fo sell when you hit Your target and it looks like the stock might keep going up.  You just have to become formulaic and have a set in stone plan.

Sometimes, when I hit my target and I REALLY feel it’s going to keep going up then I’ll sell a portion to lock in some profit immediately and do a trailing stop loss on the rest to ensure an overall profit while keeping my money in there in case it moons."

I just like having the PDT rule to keep me disciplined.  I figure if I can build my $8k to $25k then that means I have the discipline to do this and I will allow myself more day trades.  My overall stop loss is $4k.  If I blow $4k then I apologize to my wife, move it to a ROTH IRA (like she wanted to in the first place) and never look back.  That’s the deal.  I’ve learned how to lose gracefully in life....trust me.

Currently, I’m losing too many trades to feel comfortable.  I haven’t developed a strategy I’m super comfortable with (however I’m working with one now that looks promising), I still don’t fully understand a lot of the aspects of TA, and I’m just now dabbling in options trading.  I am not the type of person who goes head first into things.  I’m a very cautious, skeptical and careful person.  I dip my toes in first and test the waters.  I have made a few successful swing trades and am kind of thinking I might be more of a swing trader if I am going to be a trader at all.

I made one huge mistake with MVIS and got really lucky when it shot back up and I was able to get out even.  I got caught up in the false rumors and went against every rule I set for myself.  I almost lost 1/2 of my capital on that one stock.  Lesson learned.  I don’t believe anything I read on Reddit.  I just mine through the bullshit to find the gems.

I started with $8k and slowly and surely over the last 3 months I’ve built my portfolio to....$8,140 is where I’m sitting today.  I am treading water because I’m learning the game.  I never (except the one time I did, and got lucky to walk away even money) risk enough on a trade to ruin me.  Sounds like you were trying for huge profits and basically were gambling.

AskReddit,fqo7rfq,t3_gjn5vc,1589509313.0,"This is industry specific, but I used to be a truck driver and we would have these safety meetings that were hosted by this guy who traveled around the nation and did them.  

Every year at some point, he would say “There’s no such thing as an *accident* because they’re always preventable.”  That pissed me off every time because I feel like definitions of words are important and words should be used properly.  Preventable or not, an accident is something that has unintended consequences...period.  You would have to be intending to crash for it not to be an accident.  

About the 3rd year in, I was hungover one morning at this goddamned meeting on my day off and I lost it.  I shouted from the back “GET A DICTIONARY AND LOOK UP THE DEFINITION OF ‘accident.’”  He stopped mid-sentence confused looking and said “What was that? Who said that?”  I stood up “Right here, man.  Look up the definition of accident.”  By this point my boss is right next to me trying to get me to sit down but I’m committed.  “LOOK IT UP!  You don’t get to change the definition of words so you can sound like some wise ass.  An accident is an accident.  It’s something that happened that you didn’t intend to happen...PERIOD!”  Negligence CAN result in an accident.  That’s still an accident!”  I was asked to leave and he never acknowledged what I said from what I heard.  Just went on with his spiel after I left and I was written up for insubordination.  Was worth it."

AskReddit,fqo5wwr,t1_fqmprkq,1589508221.0,"What I say to those people is “That’s like saying that if I have nothing to say then I should be ok with having my freedom of speech taken alway.”  Also, it’s not necessary illegal or wrong to have things to hide."
rickandmorty,fqo5nrq,t1_fqnuj7u,1589508072.0,"We don’t whine!  We just show our support by putting filters on our Facebook profiles and tweeting thoughts and prayers.  You’re going to tell me that’s not helping?  Fuck you, man!"

Talk about taxation without representation.  Anyway, I guess it would be nice if you could vote on at least the tax policy where you are working even if you’re not a resident."
rickandmorty_C137,fqna7c1,t1_fqke7ed,1589491294.0,Is this episode 7?  I missed this part somehow.  Must have been on my phone.
rickandmorty,fqn9n8u,t1_fqlkvs9,1589491019.0,Well...yes...but I mean not fans of the show.  The Americans that whined aren’t really fans of the show.  In fact I have a hard time believing this is anything more than click bait.  But I can’t refute what you’re saying because why would anyone outside of America whine about it?
rickandmorty,fqn9a94,t3_gjkylq,1589490843.0,What a pile of bullshit.  Show me one “fan” of this show that had a problem with this?  Fucking clickbait bullshit.
MLBTheShow,fqn8h28,t3_gjkmgf,1589490447.0,"Anyone with half a brain can look at this and see where the obvious problem is.  You’re spending WAY too much money on food.  Remember, when the garbage cans hit the streets on garbage day, that’s on public property now.  You would be surprised what delicious food people throw away just because it expired by a day or 3."
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fqlkl0d,t1_fqlkex9,1589460462.0,Yeah me too.  Nothing worse than typing into my spreadsheet a big loss from not minding my stop loss or not taking my profits when I should have.  It’s a good reminder that if you don’t have a plan that you stick to then you’re really just gambling.
