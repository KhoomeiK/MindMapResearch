mentalhealth,fqmwnsf,t3_gjlgur,1589484768.0,"I feel like this all the time. My therapist introduced me to the term ""starseed"" after telling her of this feeling. I don't know what you believe in, but in what I believe it kinda made sense to me, but I'm still skeptical. I'm always trying to find the reason ""why"" I feel certain ways and this is definitely one of those feelings I've been seeking answers too. It's nice to know we aren't alone in feeling like this."

relationship_advice,fg0z1gf,t3_ew5ig4,1580417806.0,"I have been in this exact situation with an old best friend of mine. She was a chronic cheater and I hated it because the guy she was dating was just a great dude and didn't deserve that. I had also had that convo with her of ""you need to tell him, you need to stop, you need to figure out what you want."" And she just didn't do anything about it and continued cheating. So I took the initiative to sit down with him and tell him. He took it horribly and I felt horrible seeing him heartbroken like that but he told me he was really glad I said something. 

Now for the best friend. She definitely was not happy with me and was mad at me for a few days but ended up apologizing to ALL of us and she understood why I did what I did and never held it against me. I told her ""look, I'm your best friend, not your enabler. If I see you doing something wrong, I'm gonna let you know. That's why I'm here. I'm the person that's supposed to hold you accountable, be the shoulder you cry on, that you're supposed to call when you're having internal conflicts. That's what. Best friend is for."" And she understood. They ended up working things out and she had stopped cheating on him and all was back to normal! 

So yes, please do tell him, but when your friend reacts poorly, kill her with kindness ❤️"

Im a hair stylist and we also have gendered prices (not my choice) but I also have a lot of butch lesbians in my chair as well. I charge by style of hair cut. If I gave you the same kinda hair cut as I would do on a man, Im gonna charge you for a men's hair cut. Thankfully this doesnt bother the owner as she agrees and it feels nice to charge accordingly."
