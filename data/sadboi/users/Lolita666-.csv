Right now i am 25, and i got dumped by the same guy twice, he says because of his depression and anxiety, but i am not sure if he is honest, because i catch him in a lot of lies. It hurts me badly... I had a hope, plans for the future, but now i have nothing. I feel empty and disappointed. In the last two years my depression reached the highest level, and i don't have motivation to live anymore.
