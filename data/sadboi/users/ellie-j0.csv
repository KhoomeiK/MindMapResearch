therapy,fpx6djr,t1_fpx6bo7,1588976526.0,Also you need to work on getting comfortable with your feelings. Self awareness is HUGE
therapy,fpx6bo7,t3_gfrymj,1588976497.0,"1. NEVER invalidate yourself. Your struggles are just as valid as other people’s struggles no matter how different they look. Even if they differ in severity. Some people get paper cuts. Some people have their legs chopped off. Both still bleed. Even a paper cut can infected if you don’t address it. Ya feel me? 

2. I am so proud of you for working on yourself. That is freaking awesome and hugely important for being ready for a viable relationship. 

3. Opening up and feeling comfortable and not like you’re wasting their time is much easier when you constantly repeat to yourself: this is their job. It is their job to help me and not to judge me. And if they don’t do their job, say fuck them and move on to someone who will. Not all therapists are good therapists so be prepared for trial and error or u may get lucky first try. It also gets easier over time. I struggle a lot with saying things I don’t want to admit to myself. So that’s a real thing too. The more you open up the more they can help you. 

I hope this is helpful and good luck. You seem like a great guy"

mentalillness,fpijycy,t3_gdn9op,1588642468.0,self care is incredibly crucial particularly for people around illness. Remember you can’t pour from an empty cup.
therapy,fpiisgx,t3_gdbltb,1588641777.0,"I struggle with the same exact thing. I’ve gone back and forth a thousand times. Ultimately it comes down to whether you feel you can heal without telling them. Telling your parents will inevitably change a lot. For better or for worse. I wish I could help you more. And I’m so sorryto hear, but proud of you that you are a survivor like me"
therapy,fpihzup,t3_gdng6a,1588641304.0,I know what it’s like to see someone who so clearly needs help for __ and just won’t. The absolute hardest but most important thing we need to accept is that we are only in control of ourselves. We are only responsible for ourselves. It’s so so so so hard to accept especially with someone you love. But perhaps if you try it will eventually get easier.
therapy,fpihj5f,t3_gdnifu,1588641030.0,"I would suggest talking to a parent or another adult you trust. The internet can be a really rough place. My advice to you is take some deep breathes and think about future jack. Future jack doesn’t depend on what your neighbor thinks of you. Future jack doesn’t even remember all the mean social media posts! The pain you are feeling right now won’t last forever. And in the scope of your life, this will not define it. You can choose to be okay."

therapy,fp23vzi,t3_gaqj8x,1588254614.0,I can totally relate. Once I got my bipolar diagnosis and they explained to me that hypersexuality is a super common symptom; that I’m seeking that high that rush that trying to fill a void; that changed a lot bc I was self aware. Didn’t stop my habits but at least I could start healing. The big big big difference for me came from taking medicine for bipolar. Mood stabilizers. It helped with the urges.
