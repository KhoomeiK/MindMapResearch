SIL isn’t an asshole for asking. You’re not an asshole for saying no although you already said yes so be ready to answer the “why” when they ask you. 

BUT you should think long and hard about whether your no is because your brother sucks, who would be gone and out of your life once this arrangement becomes a thing, or if you genuinely have no desire to have a relationship with these kids. It’s not their fault your brother sucked growing up. 

At the end of the day, make the decision that’s best for you and what you feel comfortable with.  But don’t hold it against kids that had no say over their dads actions."

He DOES deserve to be treated equally in his relationship. That doesn’t mean she needs to lower herself, but she treats him as an after thought or a puppy sometimes. I get that power dynamics play a role in every relationship especially when there’s an age difference but when you choose to be in a relationship with someone, you’re choosing them to be your equal. 

At work is a different story. She’s more experienced and senior and obviously he has his breakdown this season and mental health concerns but that relationship dynamic starts before that comes into play."

I know when I went to FIU, there was a girl who lived on campus and tried to make plans a few times to hangout but I was young and inconsiderate and would either be “busy” or bail because my other friends had plans.

todayilearned,fqpfnrm,t1_fqpe2qq,1589545172.0,"Community colleges, and even some universities, are mostly “commuter schools” 

Not a lot of people live on campus/student housing so their lives don’t revolve around campus. Many grew up in the area so they have already built their lives outside of that setting and still have plenty of friends in the area, etc. 

More traditional American universities— you probably live in student housing of some sort (on or off campus) and yeah, you know a handful of people you went to high school with, but you aren’t necessarily friends. Maybe you go to a sports game/off campus bar/wherever and see someone from one of your classes and realize you have common interests and end up hanging out more frequently. 

And that all depends on if you’re a social person too. People at traditional universities can have a hard time adjusting to NOT being surrounded by their familiar faces and places. But someone willing to move hours away from home is (anecdotally) probably more of an extrovert. 

None of these are absolutes just some things I noticed when I switched from FIU (a commuter school) to UCF that has a big mix."
Journalism,fqm0ysi,t1_fqlv8mq,1589469609.0,"I think that depends on what school you’re at.

chicago,fqhvrbu,t1_fqhobck,1589385448.0,"To be fair. Many Democrats don’t support undocumented immigration, they just support immigration reforms that make this country more accessible to immigrants legally. Also, not holding immigrant children in worse than prison cells and not reuniting these families. I can understand the thought process of adults ignoring immigration laws and still coming anyways and being arrested. I don’t agree but I can see the logic there. 

But kids? 

And I understand it’s not as simple as ok cool they’re free to go. Because who do you give these kids to? And who represents them in court? Do parents/kids get a chance to talk before anything goes down? That last one is a theoretical because there are plenty of children of US born and raised citizens who are questioned without their parents every day. That doesn’t make it OK, but it’s the unfortunate reality of many minorities across the US. 


But this is where I lose the “I can see the logic” train of thought. 

If I go to the UK, the EU, to Colombia, to Chile, to India, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia etc. I’m subject to their rule of law. 

In some places I might be afforded an attorney/barrister/lawyer/phone call to my mom. In other of places I might not be given any of that. And that’s the rule of law in that country and it is what it is. 

In the US— you SHOULD have rights whether you are accused of breaking the law or not. And accused it the big word here because even if you have absolutely crossed the border illegally and been arrested for it, you are still innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Instead we deprive people detained at the border, or during random immigration checkpoints, of their rights. Their right to legal advice, humanitarian conditions, the right to see their families, etc. 


Anyways, my point is, the immigration issue isn’t necessarily about partisanship, it’s about the way that globalization works. The courts have upheld the issue of immigrant rights a few times, especially when it comes to children. The US was founded on the courts being non partisan and a Supreme Court being the final authority (many issues stop at the state Supreme Court and don’t end up at SCOTUS). I’m not crazy about it either because many of these positions are appointed, but that’s the social contract we all sign. We can either accept or protest either way. 

People choose to ignore or protest stay at home orders do so because they have been told for decades that science is not necessarily anything to believe in. (not Republicans, because there are people like this on every end of the spectrum.) 

Antivaxers, people who don’t believe in global warming, flat earth-ers and the list goes on and on. 

And they’re upset because the system that they were told was for low-life, deadbeat, moochers on society, is now what they need to rely on. 

And they either reject the premise that the unemployment system is supposed to be here for situations like this. 

OR the system hasn’t worked for them because of the way it was set up to fail society. 
They’re in absolute panic mode because how are they supposed to feed their families or figure out a way to pay the rent or mortgage to keep a roof over their family’s head?"

Our pool/gym closed about 3 weeks ago. This week they quietly reopened the pool M-F 9-5. They never sent an email about it or anything they just unlocked the door. The gym is still closed."
AskReddit,fo6h8n8,t3_g5pkbw,1587558730.0,Not a doctor but a sort of ex of mine landed on his back and wound up with a super rare spine injury. Most people die from it only some people have woken up but are usually quadriplegics. They basically froze him to stop the swelling in his spinal chord and were able to put his spine back in place. He walked out of the hospital some time later and coaches gymnastics.
Coronavirus,fo6f6cn,t3_g5qp8n,1587557048.0,"In Orange County Florida they’ve been letting people without symptoms get tested for a week at least. 

Not that Florida is a model to go by of course.. but some places are doing it."
povertyfinance,fo4kgqy,t1_fo474po,1587506056.0,I work in news so I don’t normally work from home. Our engineering staff turned this around in a week and I’ve gotta say they did a great job.

I’m actually streaming tears right now."
TooHotToHandle,fo3cz6n,t3_g5go5g,1587484774.0,I watched until that other guy started defending Harry for his “fear based response” which was to LIE and throw someone else under the bus. Of course it was shady even if he was just “scared”.
povertyfinance,fo39qvd,t1_fo38qzz,1587483154.0,"Yep. I’m doing fine now. I’m able to work from home and still have all my hours. But because of the free fall that’s happening I know there are layoffs coming once the dust settles. Hopefully I’m not included in that. Even if I don’t get laid off I’ll likely be making this exact salary for the next few years. Which is fine now. In 2-5 years, maybe not."
DesignMyRoom,fo32em3,t3_g5f5xb,1587479246.0,A plant would do well. Maybe some taller greens?
castiron,fo141st,t1_fo13upx,1587425314.0,"When you assembled the shelves, did it not come with these plastic semi circle things that you kind of clipped together over one of the grooves on the pole and then put the shelf over it?"
castiron,fnzejso,t3_g4g1k2,1587392504.0,"I have that same rack and I’m shocked it’s holding up all that cast iron with just just plastic clips. You may want to reinforce it. 

But it is beautiful!"
Coronavirus,fnximwp,t1_fnxh8u4,1587339411.0,"In headlines for publications that aren’t necessarily local, you would put the state instead of the name of the city. People will know the state, the city isn’t a guarantee."
TooHotToHandle,fnwgxfj,t3_g49zrs,1587318165.0,"Yeah, I found I hard to believe that they all committed to the whole “personally growth” thing that quickly. It’s obvious they knew something about the twist, money, challenges etc. But it’s weird to me that a bunch of people who agreed to isolate themselves on an island under the pretense of “I like to fuck” would go to the whole I wanna be a better person in a relationship thing in 24 hrs. 

Also the only thing that made it feel “real” is that barely anyone actually wound up together. One shot storm of a couple and one (seemingly) genuine couple and then a bunch of single people sounds more realistic than everyone magically pairing off and there you go."
florida,fnp407z,t1_fnoxa09,1587138818.0,"For what it’s worth, the Miami Herald and the Tampa Bay Times are full of respected journalists. 

If more people subscribed they wouldn’t have to load up on ads but they do good local journalism and great state/political analysis. Orlando Sentinel is in the same league."
AskReddit,fnode6b,t3_g2s94t,1587121332.0,"I’ve posted this before, but a girl spread a rumor that I shit on a guys chest when I was in high school. I queefed. Because. Air in vagina. I guess he told someone and it spiraled out of control. I had a neighbor who graduated several years before I even went to that high school call me to tell me I need to keep my business to myself... so there’s that."
