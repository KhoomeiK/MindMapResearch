aspergers,fhfkm7b,t1_fhf53qt,1581545303.0,I remember a couple of the first things my now husband told me on a phone call before our first date was that  1. He had autism and 2. He had epilepsy  and would that be a problem? I said probably not and revealed just as casually that I was bipolar. Neither of us had much dating experience which was so so evident. But funny enough it didn't matter. We stayed honest with each other. We worked through our differences in the way we processed the world and 4 years and a kid later we still function very well together.
aspergers,fhfex82,t3_f2txjf,1581542014.0,My husband has asperger's. We've been together for 4 years and we now have a baby. It can be difficult but there's also a lot of love. I wouldn't trade him for anything.
CsectionCentral,fh765fa,t1_fh6wko5,1581316581.0,"Same! Preeclampsia,  postpartum preeclampsia and spinal headache. But I opted to wait the headache out and it got better after a couple days. 

Be warned OP that the anesthesiologist might say it couldn't possibly be a spinal headache as it's so rare. 2 Doctors that consulted with me told me this before the one that saw me in the ICU and offered me the blood patch confirmed it was probably a spinal HA. Goodluck."
AspiePartners,f49h3mn,t3_djqvli,1571465999.0,"I think it was maybe 3-4 months into our relationship. I said it first. My aspie boyfriend said it back a week later. Since then he rarely says it spontaneously. He mostly either says it in response to me saying it or in situations where its routine (going to sleep, when I drop him off for work). We've been together for 4 years now, married for 2 and are expecting our first child in a month."
CautiousBB,f3e3lff,t3_dgk7j6,1570856291.0,I'm not sure if it's too early for the hormone relaxin to start moving your pelvic bones but tailbone pain is common. I think I had it starting in the 2nd trimester and still experience it at 34 weeks.
keto,f2fgv6l,t3_ddbbia,1570217550.0,"Lol yeah I got the keto parasite too. Almost 34 weeks now.

Congrats."
pregnant,f1y1ymp,t3_db33dj,1569807872.0,2 cups cherries. I like the frozen ones.
BabyBumps,f1rqbaf,t1_f1r2o3n,1569718812.0,We thought about plan b as well because it was only once without protection. I left it up to my husband and he said no. And now we are having a baby!!! So crazy but also feel blessed.
BabyBumps,f1rpyth,t3_dalpmw,1569718685.0,We only had sex once without a condom or protection our entire relationship. And amazingly we got pregnant.
pregnant,f0zoe2p,t1_f0za7jx,1569099713.0,I love that feeling!! She does it all the time now at 31 weeks.
BipolarReddit,f0uy503,t3_d6omn3,1568954994.0,Keto definitely helps improve my mood. Not sure if it's the sugar or grain but it  makes me more depressed.
pregnant,f0qtjox,t3_d5uzpd,1568866196.0,I threw up mucus on my hands this morning in my car after coughing. Love how the random vomiting comes back in the 3rd trimester. Just bringing it full circle.
BabyBumps,ezveh3a,t3_d2fgs6,1568175221.0,Had sepsis at 25 weeks after a UTI/kidney infection. Fever got just over 102. Baby was definitely stressed. I was tachycardic and so was she. Had to stay the night in the hospital. 30 weeks now and everything is good.
AspiePartners,ezrb8j7,t3_d1gp95,1568071289.0,"I was the first to say I love you in the relationship. He didnt know quite how to take that at first. He was definitely not ready to say it back at the time. I think it took him a couple weeks to think about it before saying it back to me. 4 years later he still doesnt really say it spontaneously. It's mostly in scripted form (so like if he's leaving for work in the morning or right before we go to bed or in response to when I say it, things like that). But I find that to be very in character with his aspergers. 

I wish you guys the best."
AspiePartners,ezr8et1,t3_d1r5th,1568070185.0,"My husband has aspergers and I have known for our entire 4 year relationship that he was not physically attracted to me due to my weight. He keeps himself very fit and active. But does that stop him from wanting to have sex with me, no. I'm currently pregnant and at my highest weight ever and that has still not affected his desire to be intimate with me. He doesnt make me feel bad about my weight. He has only ever encouraged me to want to eat better and exercise so that I can keep up with the baby and be healthy for her. He's willing to be my coach after the baby gets here. 

I guess my point is that if your SO is treating you like shit instead of positively encouraging you to get healthier (which it sounds like you were already in the process of doing) than that's totally on him. It may not even be an aspie thing. He may just be an asshole. Sorry to be so blunt. I would keep trying to communicate and be very direct with your wants and needs. If he's not willing to go to therapy you still can."
BabyBumps,ez761ww,t3_d00zkf,1567719367.0,I definitely just need a hug and a good cry
BipolarReddit,ez5ahus,t3_czt7pe,1567697419.0,Purely anecdotal but I was on a rather high dose of lamictal (200mg and 300mg XR). I used the nuvaring for years with no back up protection and never got got pregnant. And I did get pregnant when I went off my nuvaring  so not infertile either.
pregnant,eyv9ozo,t3_cyoht8,1567485320.0,300 lbs here and 29 weeks and I look obviously pregnant. I have a weird B belly too but the top is big and round and very obviously a baby bump. Dont be too hard on yourself.
aspergers,eyati87,t3_cw95lc,1566969592.0,My now husband didnt put it in his profile but it was almost the first thing he told me during our first phone call.
pregnant,eyaqlu5,t3_cwfgk6,1566967695.0,"It got better around 16 weeks and weeks 20-24 I felt like my normal self again. I had energy, no vomiting. I felt good. 28 weeks today and the vomiting is back, I'm tired again and everything hurts. It's come full circle now. So...it gets better...but then miserable again."
BipolarReddit,ey4ax28,t3_cvhqxk,1566786673.0,"Yes, they thought I was depressed so gave me prozac. They totally missed the mixed episode that followed and light psychosis."
pregnant,ey1pmdy,t3_cuy3lg,1566706705.0,Plus size mom here at 27+4. I am around 300lbs right now. I first starting feeling flutters at 13 weeks and then proper kicks at 23 weeks. My husband first felt kicks from the outside at 26 weeks. I do have an anterior placenta as well so while I have seen she is very active on ultrasound I dont feel 90% of it.
pregnant,exub7u3,t3_ctwgd7,1566581609.0,"NICUs are so amazing now. I wish you, your baby, and your family so much love. I believe you are doing the right thing. It's what I would do too."
pregnant,exg6q5r,t3_cso8gl,1566256708.0,Got to love shitty doctors. I once saw the NP in my primary's office because I was having severe anxiety and couldnt get a hold of my psychiatrist. She told me to drink chamomile tea and read a book. I almost screamed at her and left. Instead I just quietly left at the end of my appointment and cried in my car.
BipolarReddit,exg5tlr,t3_csn4tf,1566256142.0,I did not have too many problems with topomax. I adjusted after a couple weeks. I dont feel like it helped my mood but I lost a ton of weight on it and it kept my appetite in check. I came off of it for a while because we were considering having a kid and going back on it was a rougher experience. I ended up in the ED with tachycardia and palpitations. I'm just not on it anymore nor will I go back on.
pregnant,evvw301,t3_cljnaj,1564848848.0,Honestly I would just go to labor and delivery at your hospital or call their nurse line instead. I've been twice so far and it was a great experience when I was super anxious and thinking my water had broken too early. I'm sorry you had to experience that from your OB office.
beyondthebump,eviit1d,t3_cjzk5o,1564543364.0,24 weeks pregnant and just diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. I also have a couple lumps on my thyroid. Hoping things will go back to normal post pregnancy but not a guarantee
CautiousBB,eu3eat4,t3_cef4bz,1563412399.0,I measured almost a week behind for my first trimester and now at 22 weeks she's measuring just fine. And this was with a known conception date so my ovulation date was accurate. I hope everything goes ok in the weeks ahead.
pregnant,etuib31,t3_cdiljb,1563213172.0,I dont agree with the above commenters. I dont get nipple tenderness with my periods and that was my first pregnancy symptom. It started just after ovulation and has yet to go away at 22 weeks. But bc is generally pretty good at keeping you from ovulating. So I would test just to be sure.
AskReddit,etuhqin,t3_cdi0uj,1563212838.0,Arachnophobia. The fear has not gotten better with age.
CautiousBB,esdlg6k,t3_c76n2t,1561860988.0,At 5 weeks 2 days barely a gestational sac was seen on ultrasound. I had spotting that day too. 2 weeks later there was the baby with a heartbeat. I'm 20 weeks now. I hope it's just early for you as well
KetoBabies,eq8zgzf,t3_bxpb4w,1559880278.0,Definitely!!
pregnant,eox7p9q,t3_bteui5,1558920199.0,I cramped a lot for like the first 5 weeks after conception. I even had a little spotting. But everything is healthy so far at 14+5. I can even feel her starting to move in there.
