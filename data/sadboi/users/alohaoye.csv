I get that there are some rare parents out there who hire a nanny so that they don't have to deal with their kids. But in my experience, and I feel this must be true for most NP's, is that they hire a nanny to allow them to spend more *quality* time with their kids. That's how I felt about my NF. They are wonderful parents, and having me there to help them out made them able to be even more present with their kids when they were not working. They could spend one-on-one time with each kid while I watched the other two; take the older girls out shopping or something while I watched the baby, they could go to school events with their oldest while I watched the younger two. Their dad is a doctor and mom is a professor--they work hard and are awesome parents! They don't have a nanny anymore (they didn't hire a new person after I left) but when I was with them, they clearly needed the help--with three girls, one being 3 months when I started--and it really 

I just hate when people make comments about families who have a nanny implying that they ""don't want to spend time with their kids"" or whatever."

Being able to recognize when I’m feeling awful about myself and taking a moment to think, and react in a different way(therapy def helped me with this.  Yeah, the “break up with her” response is understandable, I’ve had guys in the past stop dating me for this. But there is truly more to the story than “she’s awful and immature, leave her.”  

My current boyfriend has been patient and understanding and we have been able to communicate about it, so that has also helped me....if OP wants to be with her it’s possible to work through it, but only if she is able to recognize her behavior, get some therapy and dig into her past and why she reacts this way."

I meant that it can hurt after a while—like my skin gets more sensitive or chafed from the friction—not vaginal stuff.  Maybe if I didn’t shave I wouldn’t have that issue..?  FOR SURE if someone’s  vagina is hurting during sex that is a problem and a reason to see a doctor! Anyway, I meant “after a while” like if it’s getting close to an hour. 

From my perspective women are not saying that it hurts after ten minutes but rather that they prefer actual penetration to last about ten minutes. That’s great that you enjoy it for much longer, everyone is different. Some people just enjoy other forms of sex and foreplay a little more than penetration."

Maybe it’s not considered straight up molestation but it’s weird and inappropriate behavior.  Yes, it was very brief and it didn’t happen again, but that’s not a normal interaction to have. A 16 year old boy tickling his cousin on her upper legs to the point where he is touching her private area...that’s not normal. 

I had somewhat of a similar experience with a male cousin, he made it seem playful and it started as him giving me “wedgies” and then led to pulling my pants down and “tickling” in my underwear. Now what happened to you is different but I think we feel similar because the way it happened wasn’t malicious and I didnt have any bad feelings towards him (until I was older and he did some other weird things) But that doesn’t mean it was appropriate at all and your feelings and concerns about it are valid."

My psychiatrist prescribed 1 mg twice daily (I slowly worked up to that) so that’s what I’ve been taking for about a year now. I just take it as prescribed. If I ever abused it or took more pills than I should, that would leave me with some days toward the end of the month where I would be without it so that keeps me from not taking more than I should (even though there are days where I would like to just knock out...but I’m dealing with depression too which I need to get help with).  

Idk what your doctor would think about prescribing it to take daily. Do you have some addictive tendencies that make you fear that you would abuse benzos if you were given a month’s worth? I was addicted to weed for several years, smoked heavily each day and couldn’t sleep with out it. So I was worried at first about abusing the clonazepam. But it hasn’t happened and if anything it’s helped me with weed cravings. Haven’t smoked weed since being on it as well as Lamictal.

If she found out something that the kids had done while with me that she didn’t like, she would tell THEM and not me, and the kids would relay the message to me. The kids never said “MB told us to tell you...” because they genuinely want to do what their mom wants for them. For example when their middle child told me that if we want to listen to music radio music it has to be Kidz Bop. we would listen to the radio in the car when I would drive them places. A totally normal thing I thought, but I guess the kids were too young to be hearing some of the music played on the radio. Understandable but I never thought about it; I grew up listening to the radio in the car!

So, this is what ended up happening:

After my mom making those comments, I was super upset and depressed. Like didn't want to eat or talk to anyone or come out of my room. I didn't know how to handle it but by Friday, I was feeling a lot better and was ready to talk to my mom about it.

But, I was woken up by my dad coming into my room, sitting on my bed hovering over me--angrily talking/almost yelling and on the verge of crying--that he was ""starting to get really up set by this. You're punishing your mother! How is it that the three of us (meaning him, my mom, and my sister) are all downstairs talking about this and we all remember YOU saying that you would talk to Aunt Terri about this. And now she STILL doesn't know and you expect your mother to know what you're thinking! You can't change your mind abut telling her and not tell us!"" Etc. Etc. 

I'm trying to explain to him that I did want to talk to Aunt  Terri about it, because I care about her and I want her to know why I am pulling back and staying out of family functions. My dad keeps yelling at me ""Then why haven't you done it yet?? And now Kip (my brother) still doesn't know either and he has no idea what's going on and doesn't know why his cousins aren't around or coming to his party!""

I explain to him that I thought it was decided that no one would talk with Aunt Terri until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas. Again my dad is super angry and almost crying ""Why didn't you just tell her anyway??! Do you have ANY idea how much torture your mom went through having to tell Aunt Terri and Uncle Paul that we would be having Thanksgiving and Christmas on our own?""    (um wtf we always wanted to have these holidays on our own btw).

I'm like OK I'm sorry...  my dad: "" You're not sorry! And now it's been months since the holidays and you STILL haven't talked to her! And you still haven't talked to Kip! And now you're punishing your mother for inviting Nick and Sarah (his wife) when it was YOUR responsiblity to talk with Aunt Terri and Kip about this stuff so that your mother wouldn't have to deal with figuring out who to invite !!""

Basically he was extremely angry, I felt like a little girl again, I was crying and trying to explain myself but nothing that I said was ""right."" He interrupted everything I tried to say

Then my sister came up to talk to me after, me expecting to get some sympathy from her, but no, she is berating me as well, basically saying the same thing. I'm crying and I tell her that our dad was angry and I felt scared, she goes on to say ""Yeah he's angry and both of them (my parents) have been downstairs crying all morning and I've had to deal with that, because YOU apparently don't remember saying that you would talking to Aunt Terri and Kip about all of this! This was supposed to be a happy weekend with the baby shower and you've ruined it!""  There's more back and forth between us but I'm in a weak position because I'm already upset and crying, I had been depressed all week and was startled out of my sleep by an angry father, so she takes this opportunity to kick me while I'm down. ""You say horrible things about our mother and YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH OUR PARENTS DO FOR YOU! AND YOU NEVER ONCE SAY THANK YOU! And I'm just going to say the truth, YOU'RE UNGRATEFUL""

So, long story short, father and sister mad at me for not telling my aunt and my brother about my cousin molesting me and my sister, because its causing ""so much pain"" for my mother because she doesn't know how to navigate inviting my aunt and cousins to family events including my brother's baby shower. And this entire time my mother is MIA, like HOW the fuck do you let Dad and Katie treat me like this??? You know they are up here yelling at me and angry with me for apparently ""punishing"" you.  I know I'm an adult but I literally felt like a child again, like I couldn't stand up for myself, anytime I tried to explain anything about why I hadn't talked to them, why it wasn't in the top list of my priorities in life over the last several months, they come back with ""YOU'RE just SELFISH.""

So I end up just sending a text to my brother, Kip, saying the I'm sorry to tell him this now and through text but Katie and I were molested by Nick when we were kids and that's why we haven't been having holidays with them this past year. Saying I'm sorry I didn't tell him sooner, I should have told him well before his baby shower, but Dad and Katie and super angry with me for not telling you.

&#x200B;

His response? Completely compassionate and loving. He's the youngest and labeled by  my parents as the one with ""the most issues"" and ""major problems"" (I personally do not think this, he does deal with depression and had very bad social anxiety for along time but he is SO much better now...obviously he is living with his girlfriend and her daughter and he is having a baby, he's super happy and like a totally different person).  but over the course of all of these events last week, esp Friday, he was the most normal, understanding, loving, compassionate, and logical person. Part of his message back to me included ""I hope that no one is mad at you, this happened to YOU, this is your story to tell and there is no right or wrong time to tell anyone.""

&#x200B;

I also went over to my Aunt Terri's house to tell her what happened, that was heart wrenching, luckily she had the best response I could hope for. But I'm still sad about seeing her face, she was so sad and horrified. She couldn't believe it at first (she did NOT say that she didn't believe what I was saying, but was just in shock). We talked about that this happened when he was 13 and I was 8...he had a LOT of problems (he was depressed, attempted suicide multiple times, was physically and verbally abused by my uncle, was addicted to porn, has Tourette's, is extremely overweight) not excusing what he did, but I truly do not think he is monster or a horrible person, I DO believe he is mentally sick and was even more sick/messed up when he was a teenager. Still don;t want to be around him.  This just broke her heart. And it was so forced. I know that I wanted to tell her but I was so pressured that day, my father and sister being genuinely angry with me about not telling her. I just did it. 

&#x200B;

End of the day? Dad and Katie: ""Oh I'm so proud of you, that was really brave of you, etc etc"" 

&#x200B;

It''s been a week and I am back at my apartment with my boyfriend and have been crying hysterically every night because I can't stop thinking about the whole situation. I'm still in shock about what I heard from that father and sister. My mother was supportive for me AFTER I said I was leaving and she ran after me and explained that ""what they said and did was wrong, they have problems... and she does NOT think I was punishing her, she does NOT think I'm ungrateful, my dad and sister get angry if they see me upset at all...etc.""

But when it was happening she didn't stand up for me!

I'm just....totally confused and hurt and angry. I can't believe that my own father and sister said those things to me and got angry with me, made me cry, told me I was selfish and ungrateful, and literally did not give me a chance to speak or defend myself. On top of that, thinking about my aunt and how she now has this information that her son molested her nieces."
relationships,ero00v8,t1_ernz13x,1561064988.0,"Like a lot of other commenters are saying, I think her age has a lot to do with it...I guess? I mean I would not have acted this way at 22 but I'm a much older millennial. At the same time I can think of ex-friends I've had who WOULD have done the same thing at 22...and they are exactly the kind of girls who think everyone wants to screw them, everyone is always hitting on them, they have 10 guys in love with them at the same time..etc. 

I agree with the vibe you get about her. :/"
relationships,ernys3o,t1_ernvld6,1561064148.0,Exactly what I was wondering. It definitely awful and uncomfortable to be hit on from a much older guy that you don’t want that kind of attention from. But the text she sent was a bit...dramatic? Like why didn’t she just leave and then maybe tell the head of the “hobby” about it. Or maybe even tell the wife still...but in a much more realistic way. I think the text was over the top. Unless he actually said “I want to fuck you tonight.” Which doesn’t seem like he did.
relationships,ernxq84,t1_ernrg2c,1561063458.0,"True, she has already judged. I think there is a way she can tell her friend this in much less harsh way. I know that if I were in this situation I would probably feel really stressed, anxious and annoyed...and might convey to the friend something like “I’m sorry, but I just get a very anxious and stressed feeling when I’m around you with your kids. You’re a great mom, and I’m not sure why I get these feelings but I do, and I can’t be around it. I really just want to hang out with you one on one” Something like that. 

I’ve had to say similar things to friends about their boyfriends, or even just about their relationship with their boyfriend...I know it’s totally different with kids especially if you’re dealing with an already offended/very defensive person."
Molested,erfsu74,t1_eqpzgx4,1560816980.0,"This sub sucks, honestly. Most of the comments I’ve read on this and other posts are fucked up. People come here to vent and/or share their story and get support from others. Most people are not looking for advice (especially not from self-admitting psychopaths). I find that r/FamilyDysfunction is more supportive. 

 I can’t imagine the pain you suffered and still suffer, I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. It’s clear that you are posting this to share your story. Thank you for sharing your story and I hope that you continue to heal as best as possible. Your therapist will file a report. End of story. Good luck <3"

relationships,er41r86,t1_er3xhbb,1560478766.0,"I say it’s a fair trade as well..sort of...but also kind of dysfunctional. honestly I wouldn’t even choose to be in a relationship with a guy who refuses to do something that I like/need in bed (meaning oral....which I think is a completely normal and simple thing!) Oral is the way that I have my best orgasims, if I don’t have oral sex in my life with a guy I just feel unsatisfied...and if they don’t do or don’t like it then it’s a deal breaker for me. Maybe that’s harsh but I want to orgasm and I think that’s fair. Luckily I have wonderful man who loves to eat me out and is amazing at it. 

The fact that he doesn’t even finger her is ludicrous. It’s only been three months...OP and this guy are sexually incompatible...I guess she can do with that what she wants but I would be OUT"
family,er40fvc,t1_eqyuc3g,1560477751.0,"I appreciate you taking the time to read this and respond.

 I’ve basically locked myself in my bedroom (my old bedroom from when I was a kid) since Monday night when my mom said all of those things. It fucking sucks. I talked to my sister and she empathizes with my mom, which makes sense because that’s how she is...she feels bad for my mom for some reason and always comes to her defense.

Talking with my boyfriend has been the only thing getting me through. He is on my side and feels angry for me. He is in a similar (but worse) situation with his mother regarding the abuse he experienced from his older brother. So he gets me. I love him and he’s my rock right now.  Talking to my therapist also helped."

Molested,er3xqim,t1_equk9uf,1560475650.0,"I’m sorry this person posted this response. It’s not helpful at all. I think anyone else including me knew exactly what you meant in your post. This response what completely unnecessary and kinda fucked it to even write to an abuse victim.

It’s clear what you meant, your writing was very clear. I’m so sorry this is happening to you, my heart truly breaks for you and I wish there was something I could do to help you."
Molested,er3w26f,t3_c02630,1560474298.0,"This may or may not happen to you but it happened to me. I was molested by a cousin when I was about 9. He’s about 6-7 years old than me.I didn’t like it but never really had bad feelings about it. I do remember not wanting to be alone with him (my sister and I were babysat at his house with our other cousins).  He also did other things that made me feel sexualized/like he was sexually attracted to me through various actions.  I literally never thought much about it as I grew older, and if I did think about it was more like , “I wonder if that really happened?” all through my late teens and 20’s we were never close but spent time at family functions just hanging out and playing games with everyone else. 

Anyway, flash forward to last summer when I was 30, I began experiencing severe depression, anxiety, irritability and mood swings, ended up having a psychotic episode and in the hospital for cutting my arm up. A psychiatrist there just happened to ask me right questions about sexual abuse (no psychiatrist or therapist ever asked me these questions before) ...and I brought up this thing about my cousin and it was like a light switch went on. I suddenly was extremely upset and disgusted and had vivid memories of it...memories of being scared, grossed out, confused, violated.  Because of my experiences and my symptoms I was diagnosed with some form of cpstd and borderline. 

My message to you and that I felt exactly like you do for most of my life but one day, as a 30 year old woman it all hit me and manifested in a bad way. I hope that this does not happen to you. And I do NOT mean to scare you. It’s just a possible explanation. Doesn’t mean that what happened to me will happen to you (of course) I just wanted to offer my thoughts and experience. <3"
Molested,eqxplln,t1_eqxf251,1560372391.0,"Yes, It's like she knows that it was a horrible thing but she feels compelled to keep inviting my other cousins, and my cousin Nick's wife to things...where there is a possibility that he will show up too. Her reasoning is Facebook...people see things on Facebook and don't want to feel left out (?) I'm just not a sensitive person like that so I can't relate to her on that front. I also fucking hate facebook.

I never acknowledged the abuse until last summer (right around this time)  when I was hospitalized for cutting myself and extreme suicidal thoughts. Luckily there was a great psychiatrist there who happened to ask me the right questions, and all of this came out. 

I've actually been texting with my sister about this just now. She said that my mom's therapist advised her (last fall!) to not talk to my aunt and uncle about it at all, and that my sister and I need to be the ones to talk to them so they know why we have been distancing ourselves from their family. I guess that makes sense, I just didn't know that this was happening. If I had known I would have told them several months ago because I literally don't GAF about their feelings and don't care if I ever see them again."
Molested,eqx7gqp,t1_eqtjbjm,1560366027.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and respond. You are doing the right thing for your youngest child. I wish that my mother could be as strong and courageous as you.

The frustrating thing with my mom is that when all this came to light last summer, she was horrified, apologetic, said she would do anything that I needed from her. I am an adult so I don't really need protection and I can make my own choices. But she told me that my sister and I would never have to worry about being around our cousin again, that we would come up with a plan to tell my aunt and uncle about what happened. She was also worried about that fact that he, my cousin, has a young daughter was scared of what might happen to her.

Flash forward to now, my mom and even other people in my family who know about this are acting like its not a big deal. She doesn't say those words exactly, but her actions show it. 

I'm sad that I will have to have limited contact with my mom going forward because this is too hurtful."

I am not purposely stopping cold-turkey and would never choose to do so. 

I have not been able to get in touch with my psychiatrist to get a refill so i have been without it since last night. It's not like her to not respond to my emails or call me back, let alone not refill a prescription...so I am super anxious and cant stop worrying about it."

I called my psychiatrist and left a voicemail, still felt anxious so..
I called my PCP’s office to see if he can send the refill for me and the refill coordinator said he should be able to. 

I just don’t know why a psychiatrist would do this? She may not be nice but she’s very smart and is usually on top of this...and she knows that last year I suddenly stopped taking my meds and ended up in the ER...it’s just maddening to think about"
Anxiety,eq379mb,t1_eq30b9n,1559750728.0,Yeah that’s why I don’t like her because when I was having full sessions with her she would be very judgmental. I only see her for med checks now. I really need a new psychiatrist

CompulsiveSkinPicking,eq112x3,t3_bwwmh3,1559698867.0,"It wouldn’t hurt to talk to your therapist. My mom had a similar reaction the first time I told her I was concerned about my skin-picking; she just didn’t think it was a big deal. I had to have another sit-down serious convo with both parents a couple years ago about it, because it had gotten so bad that I wouldn’t wear shorts in the summer and I didn’t want them to be shocked if they saw my spots and scars (my main problem is my legs). 

Once I told them, my sister, and a couple of friends, I felt like it wasn’t a big secret anymore and it actually helped me somehow, and I got SO much better and I was able to comfortably wear shorts or go swimming the next summer. I am still a skin picker and it comes and goes in waves but it is MUCH more under control now.

Anyways, the first step to being able to have some control over it is facing it and talking about it, which you are doing here, and I think telling someone in person like your therapist could help too. There are obviously more actions to take and ways to combat it, which you can definitely learn from this sub and maybe even from your therapist too."

Nanny,epnlro2,t1_epnjk0m,1559329467.0,"I sympathize with you. I remember being invited to one NK’s birthday because she kept asking MB if I could come. Otherwise I was never invited. I really wanted to go to all their birthdays but never said so. My MB was totally the same as yours I think: very aware of work boundaries and she gave the vibe that she thought I wouldn’t want to spend my time off at a kid birthday party. Over time I realized that she didn’t want me to feel to pressured to spend my time doing something that I didn’t really want to do (even though I secretly did want to!)
They did include me in other things over time, they are Jewish (although I am not but was very interested in learning about their traditions) and would ask me if I wanted to stay to light candles for Chanukah, invited to me stay for dinner for Rosh Hashana, things like that. I think over time your NF will include you with similar things as well."
