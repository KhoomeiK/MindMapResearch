They absolutely CANNOT do so based on the opinions of the people seeking the permit. You can’t even have a policy of granting permits based on some official’s discretion—you have to have a policy that states what kinds of events are permitted and what kinds are not. Based, again, on things like how much space is needed, what time constraints are in place, etc."

news,fj8nor4,t1_fj8cwm1,1583117664.0,"I can't speak for the DNC, but as an individual, these are my specific problems with Bernie. And frankly, I agree with his policies. But: he's way too old. My concern is he would die in office. Also, it's not a good look that he's a Democrat when it's convenient but otherwise is an independent--kind of comes off badly. And the last of my major issues with Bernie is his followers. There are certain Bernie supporters who have been really obnoxious, petty, immature, and just generally an embarrassment to him and his platform. Yeah, that's not HIM, but there are enough that I would expect him to address it, and he hasn't. I'm sorry, but at a certain point, your followers' behaviors reflect on you, and the reflection has not been pretty.

I voted for Bernie in the 2016 primaries. I like his policies. I'll gladly vote for him if he's the candidate. But I won't be voting for him in the primary this time. Unless it's just, like, him and Bloomberg left ... Yikes."
