PregnancyAfterLoss,f84w8qx,t1_f8455y9,1574262202.0,Thanks for your reply. Even though I was only 27 with my MMC I am leaning toward shitty luck and poor egg quality.   I  have 2 aunts with a history of MC. One had 3 live births and 2 MC in between. The other had 1 live births followed by several MC.  I am afraid there is some genetic component I am missing so I am leaning toward progesterone and prednisone. The lovenox seems to be a lot at this point.

ttcafterloss,f6w8sjc,t1_f6w6q49,1573220180.0,Thank you.  I have been anxious all morning. Even when I said I feel like that my baby is waiting for me she said something about adoption. Like going through adoption can't be devastating? Everyone I know who has been down that road dealt with terrible setbacks on the path to a baby. Like if she thinks I can't handle pregnancy loss why the fuck does she think I can handle adoption....even if that WAS what I wanted!

I just started reading ""It Starts with the Egg."" I am taking a million supplements now to improve my egg quality as the OB is leaning toward bad luck and chromosomal issues. I was feeling very hopeful and then this conversation just pulled the rug out from under me."
