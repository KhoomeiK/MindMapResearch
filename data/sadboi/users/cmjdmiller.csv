Dentistry,f6v1g6r,t1_f6v10za,1573174077.0,If you don’t want to read it then I don’t want your suggestions. That may be blunt but if you’re not willing to get the full story then you’re not really willing to help. It takes like 1 minute to read the whole thing. The internet truly has ruined our attention spans.
SuicideWatch,f0jxdjy,t3_d54rgy,1568665254.0,Alan Watts is a definite way to start a path into existential crisis. Don’t let him read kierkegaard or nietzsche they will really mess with him. At the same time. The three have helped me get through some of my worst depression.
SuicideWatch,f0jwjtp,t3_cyfpuu,1568664713.0,I know the feeling. My Dad told me I was to much of a coward to kill myself. Now I feel like I should do it just to prove him wrong. Toxic family is bad. Check out r/raisedbynarcissists
FinancialPlanning,ew9dv6x,t1_ew99e2f,1565223733.0,Yeah I already know of a few things I’d want to buy if I paid it off. Some days I want to pay it off just so I can buy them without guilt. I’m looking at it from a psychological standpoint because money isn’t always just  about the numbers.
FinancialPlanning,ew9dpxb,t1_ew98afi,1565223664.0,Thanks for your thoughts! I think I’ll make the plunge.
FinancialPlanning,ew9d81d,t1_ew9bnfy,1565223442.0,That’s where my mind is going. Everyone I know keeps saying to pay the card first. I’m glad I found some people on my side. I think I’m going to take the plunge and do it next pay cheque. It’s going to feel so good to own my car seeing my parents never owned a car and didn’t even have one from my 10-30s and when I started driving I had to figure it out on my own. My insurance was 350 a month the first year.
FinancialPlanning,ew9c50b,t1_ew9a748,1565222948.0,"Yeah I know exactly what you mean that’s why I want to make a choice on one. I live in Canada that CC rate is pretty standard for my 6 cards. I only have money owing on the one card I paid the others off over the last few months. The 12 for the car was because I bought used and didn’t have a good history at the time, they initially said 24% on the car and I started to walk out so he made some changes and got me the 12. I needed a car for my job and didn’t want a heater that would break down and cost more on repairs."
FinancialPlanning,ew9301l,t3_cncysp,1565218854.0,12 on car. 19 on card. Which means I’m paying about 260 on interest for the card but only 60 for the car. I know I’m loosing more money if I pay off the car first but that’s over time. I make enough that I can afford that and pay it down.  Seeing I want to still have an emergency fund and am mostly concerned with the fact I could loose my car if I default but my card doesn’t hold any collateral. Oh and I’ll just go buy something stupidly expensive if I pay off the card because that credit is available again. If I pay the car I can’t go back into debt on the account and it will be over and done with.
