If you would like/need to run multiple XLR in/outs or midi, there are a ton of beginner ones that won't put a big dent in the bank, while also being built to last. Hope this helped :)"

BPD,f0mubwj,t3_d5mh5x,1568753330.0,"Hey man, you'll figure it out. I'm in the same boat as you when it comes to self image, confidence, etc. I don't know if this is currently an option for you, but seeking professional help is a great thing. Even if you can't afford a therapist, there are many wonderful resources online for over-the-phone or message based counseling.

You're incredibly strong for going and staying sober. You are not worthless. That is called progress. Eventually you'll be back in fighting shape, and I really wish that for you. Keep up the fight, and don't let anyone or anything take you off of your path."

rap,eu26ubd,t3_cedty0,1563383601.0,"First step: Don't be in a hurry. Creating songs, lyrics or whatever, takes an incredible amount of time, patience, and practice. If you're just testing the waters, take a couple YouTube beats and write over them. Also take down the bpm of the beat if you ever feel like using those lyrics for a different track.

You can model your raps after those you look up to, but in the end, the only image you should be trying to sell is the one of yourself, because that's the one that your audience will connect with. Rap about things that *you* want to rap about. What goes hard to you? What makes you think? What makes you feel? Your audience is just gonna be an extension of your thoughts and feelings, and who has thought of something like that before.

Hope that helped in some way :)"
