This was all until I found someone at work 4 months ago who is just like me she is as damaged as me, broken and has her own demons. And now I’m right where I always end up (and I mean right now as in I’m doing it now) pushing people away. 

You will find people in your life whether you have all the subtlety of a house brick, or all the grace of bambi learning to walk. It’s never been about putting yourself out there for me, friendships happen in mysterious ways. 

There’s 3/4 I wished I’d held on to and trust me when I say I’m exactly as you describe yourself but I don’t socialise outside of work at all.

I’m In the strange place where you either love me or hate me (and I don’t blame people for hating me) but if people love me they wanna talk all the time, my problem is I can never figure out why, because I never think I’m a good/decent/person to talk too. 
 
In someways I think it’s my need of constant reassurance because if I get that I know I’m not annoying people but then asking for constant reassurance is annoying in itself. 

I tend to get myself in the situation of liking someone enough too talk to them (especially at work) then letting them in and pushing them away because I over think everything. It’s happening now and I’m almost at that stage of pushing them away."

This time last year though she had a pancreas transplant and since that morning she has needed insulin or has a high or low.
