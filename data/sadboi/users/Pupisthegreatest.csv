Lately I've decided to be up front about it with some close friends, family, and my wife. Even my teenage daughter. Its helped tremendously. And the people who didnt believe me or didn't take me seriously? Well, fuck them.  They were few and far between.

Coping mechanisms are what you use in your moment of anxiety to behave rationally and constructively. Maybe you decide to meditate. Maybe remove yourself from a situation. Maybe talk productively with a loved one and ask for help. Maybe listen or make music, or create art. Work on your house. Take a nap. Maybe take a valium. Whatever works for you.

For instance, I worked in a lab before going to school to do what I do now. I slowly pushed my boundaries, first talking to people and trying to make conversation. Eventually, I got invited to a bat. First couple times I didnt show. Third time i did and i had fun but was the first to leave. I skipped a few more invites then went to another and made a plan to stay longer. Soon I went intermittently yet regularly. Well, the sang karaoke there and urged me to as well. I was like hell no. But after a half dozen times watching I gave it a shot, and some one who wasnt a friend complimented my voice. Then I immediately left.

I began gaining some confidence and decided to go back to school. I pushed my boundaries more there. I was forced into teams with fellow students, and doing presentations. I was scared, but eventually realized after a few no one really remembered anyone else's presentations or cared. Then came clinicals. 

I was a shy wallflower at first. I stayed back and observed, how I am in most new situations. But I had to learn the job and mingle with new people every 6 weeks at new sites. I decided to try harder to break out of my shell. My therapist told me a good way to converse is to just ask questions about other people, because they usually like talking about themselves. It worked mostly, but I soon learned that not every conversation would click, and I began to care less if I connected with each new person I met, but rather only cared of I connected with myself.

Then I got a job as a tech. They started adding responsibilities and each new one scared me. Some I couldnt handle, so i asked others to do, like talking in front of other people (a huge fear of mine ), but those weren't failures. They were me recognizing my boundaries and asking for help.

Fast forward some years and I run a department with 40 people under me. I still get anxiety running meetings. I get anxious about saying the right thing. But I've slowly pushed myself and recognized boundaries. And really my therapist was instrumental in this.

18 years ago in high school I was cutting myself to get out of nerve racking situations. Now I run a department and people rely on interacting with me day in and out.  It was slow, thoughtful, and methodical and took a long time. It is slow work. But if I can do it I know anyone can do it.

I'm glad you've figured out your boundaries. Sometimes that comfort let's you push outside of them again, because you have a cushion to land in if it doesnt work."

Through counseling and self esteem building exercises I realized impressing people is the wrong way to go about it. You just have to be you, and if you click with people then you click.

Pulmonary hypertension can be transient, and is a symptom of an underlying condition. You could have pulmonary hypertension because you're in congestive heart failure due to a severe heart attack. Yeah, your prognosis is not looking as good.

You could have pulmonary hypertension because you had a bad, but not serious, upper respiratory infection, because blood leaving the heart going to the lungs is backed up due to inflamed bronchioles.  When you're not sick anymore your mild hypertension goes away.

Not only that, but prognosis is based on comorbidities which could effect medication you can use, what type of procedures are available to you, and what the proper treatment plan is going forward, which Google can't tell you and you wont know unless you're reading a textbook on pulmonary hypertension treatment and even then, theres no way without experience to know when some subtle signs or symptoms rely on a more nuanced treatment plan.

1. Your anxiety may not be rationale, but how your anxiety causes you stress IS valid. Your anxiety is real and you are never overdramatic if that is how you feel. Do not invalidate your own feelings, you will drive yourself crazy and only make things worse.  Also, find a dedicated anxiety counselor, OR be honest to the counselor you are seeing and tell them that you may have intermittent good days and need help. Any good counselor who understands anxiety knows that it probably wont magically go away and dismissing a patient after 3 good days and claiming they're cured either is dishonest about believing you or doesnt care. I would find someone else.

2. I have always and still do have difficulty with public speaking. In college, I would want to answer questions in class. In fact, I knew the answer, but my anxiety fooled me, made me doubt myself. So my heart would race, my chest would tighten, and I would doubt my answer was correct. I've worked on this a lot and made progress through counseling and medication, but even at work meetings I hate speaking up, or going round the room explaining things.

3. Same goes with work emails. I have to stop myself from looking over them over and over again.


Let me say this, get a good counselor and get help. Maybe get on medication. If you do not push your boundaries and step out of your comfort zone, then this will effect your life negatively. It took years and years of counseling and pushing my boundaries. When I was in high school I injured myself with a knife to avoid an anxious situation. Now I run a hospital department with 45 people under me.  Do I still get anxious? Hell yes. But i now have the tools to cope and it makes all the difference.

selfhelp,f7w4bv5,t1_f7vm88p,1574029767.0,I started the job before these issues. About 6 months ago. I wanted to move up and make more money and be able to be a voice for my employees.  But now I have trouble even listening to their troubles.

Anxiety,f7ly45l,t3_dwtymw,1573850244.0,"A lot of the time I'm so worried that I'll say something stupid that I get caught up in my head and am not actively listening.  Then I miss what they've said and I get even more anxiety because I'm too afraid to ask what they said.

Anxiety,f7f1lr7,t3_dvvks0,1573670446.0,"Just be blunt. Doctors are not here to judge, and if they do they are a bad doctor and you should find another. Most doctors will prescribe you medication and refer you to a counselor.

20 years ago when I first realized hke bad my anxiety was, i just told my doctor i am always anxious and depressed and if I could take medication and get a referral for a counselor. And he did thise things. 8 weeks ago I have a different doctor and did the same thing and he obliged. It should be fine to ask."
