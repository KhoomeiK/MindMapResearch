bipolar,f9m3ule,t3_e5rdas,1575440559.0,"I have a dog and I live by myself. Here are my pros and cons: 

Cons: It's a lot of work. Especially with a puppy. Vet bills are expensive and more frequent than you'd think. Leaving town is hard if you don't have someone to look after your dog. It also takes up a lot of time day to day - time spent walking, grooming, vet visits, etc. It all adds up. 

Pros: I really believe my dog saved my life. She keeps me in a routine. She keeps me vertical and moving. She loves me unconditionally. She gives me a sense of purpose. AND she's adorable. The bond I have my with dog is worth all the work. I am far more stable and functional with her around. 

The big deciding factor for me was the possibility of my dog becoming ill, or injured, or anything else. I had to be sure I could handle the scary stuff, including the inevitable. Sucks to say, but it's true.

Breathing into your abdomen is definitely easier (as someone else here pointed out). Doing it while lying on your back is the easiest, in my opinion, because the rest of your body tension won’t fight you on it. If that makes sense."

I am a musician with a private teaching studio. I had one student, about 10 years old. Her mother was a “world renowned psychologist” with the longest email signature ever. The kid had a habit of missing lessons. I have a 24 hour cancellation policy. (Duh)

Whenever the kid missed a lesson, I would get a nasty email from her psychologist mother about how they shouldn’t have to pay my cancellation fee - and then write some long nonsensical reason it was my fault. It was always a personal attack on me. When it happened for the 3rd time, I had enough and booted them. 

That woman could not have been more nasty to me. It was especially jarring coming from a psychologist, since I have bipolar and all. I have yet to go back to therapy because I don’t like the thought of my therapist being a verbally abusive asshole in real life.

adhdwomen,etu13kv,t3_cddrt6,1563201622.0,"I have Bipolar II and ADHD. The difference between hyper focus and hypomania (for me) is in how long my symptoms last. Oftentimes it’s impossible to focus when I’m hypomanic, but when I can focus it’s usually  4 days minimum of obsession over something out of character (like the time I became a chocolatier for a week!) ADHD hyper focus usually lasts about a day for me. Same goes for irritable type symptoms. If I’m pervasively irritable for at least few days about the most trivial things, it’s probably hypomania. If I’m feeling sort of edgy and cranky but it’s gone the next day...   You get the idea. 

I’ll also say that you should be careful when medicating both conditions. Stimulants have triggered mixed states for me in the past. It might not happen to everyone, but it’s something to be mindful of."

Whether it was a quick text checking in, asking how treatment was going, showing up with something for me to eat/drink when I was depressed, or just generally making it clear that they weren’t going anywhere. It’s important to keep in mind that a lot of what your friend is dealing with can only be helped with doctors, meds, and time. However, the stigma is so bad that it’s easy to believe you’re unloveable and not worth helping. I am eternally grateful to my friends that stuck by me at my worst.

BipolarReddit,etagdcu,t3_caq4eb,1562619602.0,"I am also Bipolar, CPTSD, ADHD, and Queer. I struggle with your exact question all the time. All of those things will make you irritable as hell! I think it helps to be mindful of how long your discomfort lasts, and if it’s triggered by something specific. If you’ve been feeling the same way VERY consistently for over a week? Good chance it’s bipolar related. If you’re feeling fine one minute and suddenly you feel awful? It’s entirely possible something has triggered a trauma response. Also- the confusion you’re feeling may itself be a result of trauma. 

When I am feeling totally awful, I submerge myself in an ice cold shower for roughly 20 seconds. It’s totally harmless and worth trying! Supposedly it stops fight or flight. If your symptoms are trauma or anxiety related this will likely provide some relief. If it doesn’t, it’s probably more to do with bipolar disorder. (You can also grab a piece of ice or splash cold water on your face if showering isn’t an option).

bipolar,et9kd6r,t3_calq7u,1562599013.0,"I can usually tell based on physical symptoms. My energy levels, sleep patterns, appetite, and metabolism all shift depending on how I’m feeling. If I’m hypomanic- I have trouble sleeping, very little appetite, and my clothes seem to fit better. Depression makes me unbearably tired. I could easily sleep for 20 hours a day in my worst episodes. I’m not naturally an angry or cranky person, so if I’m feeling agitated or edgy there’s a good chance I’m symptomatic (whether up or down). 

I’ll also say that it took me at least 5 or 6 years to figure out my specific symptoms and their warning signs. Keeping a diary has been really helpful. I write down whatever happened that day and how I felt. Looking back on old diary entries has clued me in to lots of my symptoms. The Daylio app and my Fitbit are also helpful.

Now in my 30s and roughly 140 pounds. My gyno does my bloodwork once a year and I always have high levels of testosterone. I take birth control for it and I feel much better. Even if it’s not PCOS, your concerns are valid and you should definitely see a better doctor!"
bipolar,esfj02x,t1_esfiet8,1561927371.0,"Yeah! Ginger is awesome. I make a lot of iced ginger tea in the summer. I literally put a teabag in a normal glass filled with water, and leave it in the fridge overnight. When I wake up I have a refreshing, calorie free, anti-nausea beverage."
bipolar,esfice2,t3_c77d1g,1561926900.0,"I’m not on Latuda specifically but have had this problem with other meds. My stomach is crazy sensitive. Currently going through it with Lithium. I find ginger to be surprisingly helpful. I always have a few pieces of crystallized ginger, and bags of ginger tea on me. Tums also help. You might know all that already though!"
bipolar,esfhtry,t3_c77fkr,1561926523.0,"I want to say DON’T EVER SMOKE AGAIN! But I too am an avid stoner who just can’t part with it completely. If I’m already feeling sort of edgy it makes me super anxious. I also have weird periphery hallucinations and some auditory stuff like a distant sound of a radio. It’s never made me full on psychotic but I’ve definitely had unpleasant reactions - especially if I’ve recently adjusted my medications. 

One thing I learned recently is that CBD counteracts the negative effects of THC. If you do continue to smoke, you should have some good quality CBD on hand in case you feel paranoid.

Take care of yourself!!"
bipolar,esfgca6,t3_c7hh1t,1561925434.0,"It definitely sounds like he is NOT OK. However- if he’s very consistently angry, and doesn’t seem to go through cyclical phases of other symptoms, like depression, or just acting “normal” then it’s probably not bipolar. Bipolar is not all rage and scary behavior. There are a lots of mental illnesses that could be causing that kind of behavior. He needs to see a doctor. The diagnosis is so doctors know how to treat it, for insurance purposes, all that stuff. There’s really no way to know without help from a qualified doctor. If he’s not actually getting help, knowing what to call it isn’t going to make a difference."
bipolar,esffiqd,t3_c7icjd,1561924829.0,"My sleep patterns are the first sign. If I can’t sleep, even with meds, I’m definitely hypomanic or mixed. If I sleep 18 hours a day without feeling rested, I’m depressed. It’s different for everyone, and I’m not a doctor, but it sounds like you might be hypomanic or manic."
bipolar,ese9j6i,t1_ese6g4e,1561888660.0,Yeah! That’s a good idea. For me it was also a matter of figuring out the more physical signs of various symptoms. If it’s anxiety I’m usually sweaty and my ears pop. Things like that.
bipolar,esdt460,t3_c76569,1561867818.0,I’ve been on it since January. I noticed relief after only a few days. Though I didn’t feel truly confident in my stability for about a month or so.
bipolar,esdsgow,t3_c72qp5,1561867201.0,"I do this all the time! My DBT therapist said something really helpful in group: “A lot of people in here use their imaginations to scare the shit out of themselves. What if you flipped it around and used your imagination to think of some happy, or neutral, outcomes instead?”

WAY easier said than done, obviously. I’d just never thought about it that way before. It was helpful to hear I have the option of imagining whatever I want. Thanks to bipolar disorder it isn’t an option all the time... but I’ll take any bit of relief I can get, when I can get it. If I’m delusional or mixed... forget it. But when it’s my anxiety, it’s easier to catch myself and change my internal dialogue than it used to be."

bipolar,erwg20i,t3_c4687n,1561342542.0,"A lot of people look for any reason they can find to invalidate a mental illness. I assume because it makes people uncomfortable and it's easier to pretend it isn't real? I don't know. That's just a guess. Anyway, I have definitely been in the ""too pretty"" and ""too fortunate"" club. I've also gained and lost roughly 50 pounds in the last few years. The difference in how people perceive/treat me based on my weight is astonishing. Humans are a real shallow bunch. Which leads me to my next point...

You don't owe anyone any kind of explanation. You don't need to prove that you are not ok. It would definitely help if people weren't so fucking invalidating and mean about it, but that's on them- not you. I know it's cliche, and it's still something I'm working on myself, but it's true! You are who you are and no one can change that regardless of how anyone perceives you. Thanks to my attending support groups in a large city, I've been able to meet people of all economic backgrounds with the same illnesses taking the same medications and dealing with the same problems. Mental illness isn't picky. Be your beautiful god damn self, inside and out, pain and all. 

(p.s. DBT support groups have really helped me tackle this problem)"
bipolar,erouzbj,t3_c30dob,1561089487.0,"Caffeine always makes me anxious, and will sometimes trigger hypomanic/mixed symptoms. If I need help with energy and focus I drink green tea, matcha, maté, etc. Any tea with theanine in it. Even then I can’t drink it every day or it triggers symptoms. I have struggled with weed addiction partially because it works on my agitation symptoms. It’s helpful but it backfires if you abuse it. It’s been difficult for me to quit entirely."

ADHD,ergdv1j,t3_c1xdlc,1560835209.0,I have done this twice in my life. First time I made myself puke and all was fine (except for the part where I puked). Second time I was on a 13 hour flight. I hate flying. So. Much. I always sedate myself on planes because I can’t handle being stuck in a tiny seat for so long. Brains are the worst. That flight was the fucking worst.
