AskWomen,fpdx8t4,t3_gcrysl,1588536062.0,"Occupying my time with a lot of activities, travelling, volunteering at music festivals and getting to know new people. If I would've done that, I'd spend that time blaming myself (which I kinda did anyway) and thinking why and what I did wrong, bleh.
But with time, every wound heals itself. We are more resilient than we think :)"

Psychosis,foo0hga,t1_foo0018,1587930089.0,"I think maybe some vitamins will help. Now in quarantine you're being sun deprived, I totally recommend taking vitamin D3. You can read about it. I take it and Adrenal vitality, recommended by doctor.
I really wish I could help you, I don't know how, I can only tell you what worked for me."
Psychosis,fonvbwe,t1_fonukxd,1587927180.0,"I know everyone says it but writing down how you're feeling, it really helps. It helps right then, almost like telling someone and reading them after a while, makes you see the bigger picture and to understand somehow what you were going through at that time and how your feelings in time changed. Also I'd listen to my favorite songs or a podcast made by my fav comedians. And I'd drown and in that feeling and started crying because of the sad songs, or feeling like you're with some friends because of the podcast. That's what I'd do, also talking with my mother because she saw me through my worst moments and accepts and understands me.
Sorry for writing so much."
Psychosis,fonukxd,t1_fontbsz,1587926758.0,"I was feeling very down and disappointed, overwhelmed by the things I had to do, I felt like I had so much to do and I couldn't put my attention into it.
 So to answer your question, I guess so, I didn't pay much attention to how I was feeling towards anyone, only my mom knew and she called the psychiatrist to recommend a psychologist. Also, I have this thing since I was a kid to try to do a lot of things even if I hadn't the time or it was just too much for me. 
Now I try to take one thing at a time, and be content with a very small thing I accomplish and to do more of my hobbies like painting or playing the guitar."
Psychosis,fonrcwl,t3_g8dlqe,1587924964.0,"You might be suffering of post psychotic depression. I was the same, none of my regular activities would bring me joy, also I was under a lot of stress because of my finals and I'd burst into tears every day for more than a week and my psychiatrist at that time (this happened a year ago), gave me Mirzaten and it really helped me. Only I gained a lot of weight, 10 kilos in a month. And I stopped taking it, now I take Trittico and some vitamins and I feel pretty good now. Also, my doctor gave me to do some blood tests and I had vitamine D and Iron deficiency, so I take supplements and I changed my diet a little bit.
I hope this helps somehow :)"
