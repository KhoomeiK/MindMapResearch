It's like most other film in that the goal is to present an impression.    I think there's two problems that irritate a lot of people whether they realize it or not.  1. It can be too one dimensional so that it breaks the illusion of cinema, and behind the curtain all you see is cringe and 2. Sex tends to be somewhat of a sacred cow, so it's easy to illicit offense and disgust perhaps even when it's portrayed poorly.  I mean in the sense that we judge it so harshly that we easily become like film buffs... or snobs.

There's probably a moral element too, that we subconsciously question the morality of what we're viewing, and when its thoroughly an act the ambiguity of who exactly these people are makes us uneasy.   When we see a couple who is acting natural and who's body language suggests they're enjoying themselves we are more convinced that we're viewing something morally permissible."

I know by today's standards this is a very powerful phone but compared to where computing is and will go it's not a very powerful device at all.   There are things Id like to do with my phone that it can't for one reason or another, and it could be years before I can.   The majority of the utility of a smartphone is arguably from available software rather than the latest hardware, and because that software is made with the consideration that it'll be running on a multitude of devices of different capabilities, it feels like even with the extra bump in performance the software isn't there to take advantage of it.   In other words, the note 9 has some potential do things it cannot do because the software to do those things does not exist.  When it does exist to take advance of the note 9s superior specs,  the difference in actual utility is mostly marginal.

There is one view of life that's like the first lines of Anna karenina, that you shouldnt fuck anything up really bad.   So in that case you shouldn't be overweight if you want a good life.   You shouldnt be any bad things.  

There is another view, that life actually isn't all that good and that there is actually a lot of relatively in how different people can live a good life. In practice this only borders on moral relativism, because there is always some amount of natural force that determines what is and is not good that becomes undeniable.   The thing is, for some people having some really bad things about their life can be part of a larger picture of living fully.   The most interesting people have some major flaws that they own.    Willingly being obese could potentially be one of those.   Although we'd still call it a flaw, as an essential piece of a larger and positive project, it might actually be integral.  This isn't an argument for why vices are good, only that the maxims we follow are more rules of thumb than strict ways of determining people's worth.   Sometimes we have to do bad things to do good things, go down before we go up.    Name me one super interesting person that hasn't caused significant amounts of problems for themselves, and tell me they'd be just as good if they hadn't. 

I want to reiterate that I don't subscribe to that argument because I can only follow it in my own life to some extent before it becomes completely impractical.   Maybe I'm just not great enough.   It's not so much that I totally disagree, just that I can't fully prove it."

A second problem is in the internal construction.   Once the phone is broken, it's not an easy fix by any stretch.  You cant just get a new digitizer and screen and install it, you need to replace a significant amount of the entire phone.  At launch thats almost a third of the phones price and it'll cost you almost as much as a brand new phone now. 

Third, while plenty of high quality cases are available the curved edges have resulted in cases not have a raised bezel on the sides of the phone, rather only the top and bottom.   This makes the phone less impact resistent in the places it needs it most.

I won't call this four because it's  more of a minor flaw and most relevant to myself, but the phone is advertised as have a high quality DAC yet the amp can't drive anything worth using with the DAC.

I thought of one last one.  With all of its fragility and clear planned obscolesence, the price on it is frankly scary.   I've been carrying mine around for over a year and it gets scarier every day.   Im seriously debating getting a new phone to avoid the heartbreak."

So imagining it as a clock, you might have something at 9, 10, and 11 but then on the other side theres something at 2.  He'll often use a hard limiter, and then play with the volume sliders in a rhythmic way.   What you end up with is that the stuff panned left sounds almost like one instrument, whereas the one thing panned right will sound very full and prestine with the emptiness around it.   This is just one example.  One thing to really pay attention to is the volume levels on each track.  Whenever there's more than one instrument panned in a similiar direction, you'll find him choosing which instrument to emphasize.  Something of note is that lowering the volume on an instrument for a moment can actually draw attention to it and give it clarity.  Because of the limiters and compressors on everything, anything loud will sound super thick and warm.   Lowering the volume makes it sound tinier and sharper so it can punch through the mix easier despite actually not being as loud."

I'm aware it's not the exact same image processing, all I've said is that Its nothing more than simple image processing that you can do in plenty of free and built in apps.

The bars are closed and where people are talking it's not about an election where one side is already in office, and the other side was vice president only 4 years ago.

Eventually, like during every election season, those true feelings will come out and from how Facebook is looking it seems that even his own voters will be considering him a senile sexual predator, while Trump will be fully immersed in pandemic coverage.    If things get better and Americans enjoy their stimulus packages, it will be a hard sell to make any covid mishandlings a popular and openly discussed topic.    Even if everything wrong could go wrong for Trump, it'll still be hard to sell the idea of his responsibility to most people.

Target,fnk65la,t1_fnjrabl,1587016130.0,"Unfortunately my first perspective is very speculative and optimistic.   Historically unions are the product of very angry and desperate people organizing, and their success is due mostly to their violence.   If they got what they wanted, they made a situation where not giving them what they wanted was genuinely scary to both their employer and replacement workers. 

We have a unique situation where sales goals are being met by double and workers don't want to show up, but otherwise we're simply not anywhere near the point of unionization yet.    Target has made very strong PR statements about their commitment to higher wages (as well as PR for why higher wages are bad) that workers confidently parrot around the workplace.   Their starting pay is above minimum wage, and they hire mostly powerless and/or ignorant people like teenagers, students, and older people.    Of course their are exceptions, but if their were enough exceptions there would be a picketline already arguing the cost of living should be covered by any job that expects a flexible schedule. 

If you want to know where effective unions breed well, look for jobs worked mostly by working class men with families.   If they can't get another job, at some point they'll stop blaming themselves and hold their employer hostage until they get what they need to live.    As an employer that's a terrifying position to be in.   If they try to replace you, those people are considered scabs and could potentially be killed by the union. 

Sorry, but target isnt going to have a real union.   They'd have something like the kind of union grocery stores have, which is weak enough to call a controlled union simulation.   Every 10 years they'll sit outside with sofas and lawn chairs and while the doors are closed for a week, and at the end of it those workers will be grandfathered into their benefits (although promptly replaced) while all new hires won't receive any.

The last thing I'll say is that when really significant changes have been made for workers rights, it's been because those violent workers unions went for the jugular.   They set their goals at a national level.   That's why Canada has universal Healthcare, whereas in the United States we don't because unions actually give their workers better Healthcare than they'd get from universal coverage.   U.S. unions tend to take care of their own first, historically. In Canada and the UK they won a lot more ground nationally."

My hope for the film is that they bring back Buck (or whatever his name was) and write him more as a grizzlier, untethered character.   Shia is a messed up dude in a lot of ways and that's why he's interesting.   I wanna see him be a little nuts.   Forget the leather and greaser attitude.  I want to see him addicted to crack, living in the gutters, and talking to walls — and he's the only one with the know-how to help the aging indy do what needs to be done.  He gets geeked on speed throughout the film and goes berserk on some minor villains.  Eats their faces, maybe.   When the final villain rolls around he refuses the pipe and wins the day because of it.   Heroes journey accomplished."

John_Frusciante,flwa7yt,t3_frel80,1585544015.0,"He's using Bb Neapolitan minor and the cm7b5 is a chord substitution, which in simplest terms is by reversing the notes that are changed to make the key neapolitan.  If you pull up a Bb Neapolitan scale you should be able to find two of the chords fit like puzzle pieces.   The third will fit into Bb aeolian neatly.   Only two internals need to change to convert those scales.  So basically a I II V 

If you were to keep all of it in Bb Neapolitan minor the cm7b5 would be a C dominant b5.   

When he moves to cm7b5 to the Fdimished7 you could look at it as a shift from G neapolitan minor (because the cm7b5 is in that key too) to G neapolitan minor.  the interval is a minor 3rd so that's why they have a very dimished sound in context.   

You could go to weird levels of abstraction and say it's a key change to the relative major (g Nea.) but pivots on the tonic to g minor and then back to Bbm Nea."

Futurology,fleg15h,t3_fo4zwn,1585083688.0,"If only we had a nanny state, all of the bad things would cease to be bad.  

If anything, prostitution serves as a powerful indictment of capitalism on par with sweatshops, although perhaps worse in the sense that with regulation a factory ceases to be a sweatshop at some point.  The ""sweating"" aspect is reduced to humane limits, so to speak. I'm not sure if there's a point where a brothel ceases to be a brothel while sexuality is a quality of every unskilled worker and they don't have other career options. At what point is there not sexual exploitation and manufactured consent? If we're serious about sexual liberation we need to have a strong foundation in autonomous consent. 

I have a better regulation.   Paying someone for sex is a human rights abuse.  Managing the selling of others to make money is a human rights abuse. Accepting money to have sex is not criminal, and those who do so should have access to job training in a career that isn't dispensable and doesn't reduce them to a crude sex object.   If they want to be a sex object, more power to them, but waving money in someone's face reduces their free choice sexually, often to the point of them really not having a choice.   Is it really consent if you don't have a choice?   Being made to have sex with strangers isn't a job like any other.  Most of us don't want to be at our jobs, and our ability to choose what job we have is extremely limited.   We should not invite the exploitation of unskilled workers by putting a dollar sign on their sexuality."

I'm not defending that industry.  It's pretty scummy.   It's a fundamentally different job than being a prostitute, though.   With prostitution you're paid for each sexual act as opposed to being paid to make a product that makes the money."

I need to support myself financially, so it's not a choice if I come in or not.   It's always been that way, but now my lack of economic freedom is forcing me into conditions that are dangerous and that my roommates will likely not tolerate much longer.    By not much longer I mean I might be getting my dismissal tonight, tomorrow, or really at any time simply because im not following good public health standards by going to work. 

It can't be good business ethics to allow this to happen, especially for a company that's been doing so well the last few years and continues to do well through this event.   The business is doing excellent when all that matters is their bottom line, but I wasn't doing excellent even when things were ""normal.""

Maybe you care about a sport and had to compete with a trans person or something, but I think the majority of people who bring it up just have distaste for trans activism and it's their way of making a winning argument.   So I guess I mean it's an argument that people bring up a lot because they want to win, and I think it's a valid question why they want to ""win"" so bad against trans activism.  My theory is because it's been very sudden and very aggressive, so a lot of people just aren't very comfortable with being totally submissive.  On the other hand I think it's transparent and easy enough to argue for that younger people are gonna see right through it once older people start spamming Facebook with it."

Some other great value brands for parlors are Yamaha and washburn.  

If it's possible you should save up for a used American Martin.   They're simply better guitars and you'll progress a lot farther.  I'd even steer you away from the parlor thing because it can be limiting.

Showerthoughts,fhcr1m5,t1_fhbw6ky,1581468975.0,"That's a gross oversimplification I hear repeated a lot.   The majority of his ""theories"" were in a weird time between the study of the mind as a proto-science and as a heavily data driven social science (with Freud playing a huge role in the change) so when we say theory we aren't necessarily talking about what we should consider a scientific theory.  It's like saying William James or Kierkegaard has been scientifically debunked because their theories aren't testable and repeatable using the scientific method.  It just isn't the point, because they're more philosophers of mind rather than scientists, and the point of reading them isn't to just agree or disagree with everything they think.  It's more literary.  What was so special about Freud is that his most famous methods of treatment (largely rooted in philosophy of mind) have efficacy.  Specifically getting people to talk about and examine their own life and formulate plans based on their insight.  He opened the door for people like skinner, Rogers, and Erikson to formulate scientific theories of what it means to do that effectively, what impedes it, and what is happening in the physical structures of the mind as it happens. 

So no, he hasn't been debunked because you can still read Freud as a philosopher and his arguments are very persuasive and interesting, and so are many of the counterarguments put forth.   Same with Jung, rank, and all of the other influential figures of viennese school.    A good starting place to examine those ideas is the book denial of death by Ernest Becker.  There actually isn't currently a scientific way to solidify a lot of those ideas,  yet they make rational and practical arguments that are very persuasive.   This suggests that there might be a great deal we don't fully understand, and that in some domains of thought we're still scratching the surface of an underlying metaphysics that has yet to be evolved into something fully explainable by a hard science."

If I told a non musician I only played the guitar, they'd be surprised to find me pick up something else.

We live in a world that is more and more dominated by paying for instant gratification, and that works against the forming of romantic bonds because it involves single transactions for sex without the hard work of forming long term bonds.   I don't think it's a particularly noble goal to allow the sex trade to expand under regulation.  I think a lot of people would get involved out of money necessities and I don't think type of productivity that comes out of it is good for people.   There's far more reason it would grow out of being capitalized on than simply because people want more sexual or job freedom.  It reminds me of how alcohol producers and distributors during prohibition lobbied to make alcohol legal and then did everything to could to avoid the responsibility of all of the motor vehicle deaths while spinning a tale about black markets.    The bastards grew the market, just like the sex work lobbyists would like to.   There's a lot of money in bodies, and I think the source of ""if only it was legal"" has a lot more money behind it already than we think.  If only it was legal, we could grow our market and avoid the consequences."
