Hang in there. There are people that are just like you. You are not crazy or weak. The struggle is real."

bipolar2,fjpyfb1,t3_feqq33,1583563196.0,"Yes.  I do. Don’t listen to the judgment. It’s bullshit. All it is is grandiose thinking. 


One of the ways I know I am manic is when I start feeling like I am better than people. Like I know better. This is manic thinking. Remember we are all sort of average. 

When I see myself as average and not knowing better than anyone else — I know I am stable. 

When I think I’m better than other people — I am on guard that I am manic."
BPD,fjpfxmz,t3_feiih5,1583549766.0,No one is ever recovered from BP. We will all cycle — even if medicated. Just gotta have a crisis plan. We maybe stable for a bit. But the only way you recover is to effectively cope with the disease and adjust your behavior to the moods that occur.
depression,fjnzmgf,t3_fecd9s,1583517531.0,"Life is meant to be a struggle. Life was never meant to be easy. Everyone struggles. I do not know why this. 

However, the trick is to somehow turn it around through experience and wisdom. 

Remember: the power of depression is that it makes you feel like everything is permanent and the only way out is to take yourself out. This is why depression is soooo dangerous. (I’m bp). When depressed — take things day by day. Get all the help and resources you can find. And good luck."
bipolar2,fjnz7hj,t3_fe89t4,1583517291.0,"One thing that was super empowering was to read all you can about the illness. There are a lot of misconceptions about the illness. Before I read up — I was one of them, too.  Once you learn how the illness you can will pan out in your life you will be so much better off. 

Also remember — you have always had BP. And life with untreated bp is the worst. So now you can take a little control and have power over it. 

It was a grieving process for me— and that’s okay. The life we thought we would live is different from the one we just learned about. There are like five steps of grieving — I did it. And I’m better for it. 

One thing I wish someone told me is that meds will never be enough. They most definitely help. But you will still cycle. The goal is to have a crisis plan you can fall back on when you are there. A crisis plan can stop you from falling into a bigger hole and making the mania or depression worse. It is much easier to climb out of the hole. 

Start mood tracking. Be on top of the Illness. 

Always have a psych and a therapist. Be Med compliant. People suffer needlessly because they get off their meds when they are stable. Don’t fall into that trap. It’s probably that the meds are finally working when you are stable. 

Hope this helps. Dm with any questions."
BPD,fjnxzns,t3_fedr7m,1583516585.0,"Nevvvver make any important life decisions when manic or depressed.  You are under the influence of some serious symptoms. When you are manic or depressed take things day by day. Don’t think about the long term. 

Whatever you want to do — write it down. When you become stable look at the list. If you still want to do it — then you can do and have the courage to do it while stable.   If you regret what you wrote down — more power to you— you just saved yourself heartache.  

I have lost multiple jobs because of impulsive decisions.  The damage sucks."

BipolarReddit,fjnw6rw,t3_fead42,1583515544.0,"It does. But we have to learn to accept what BP is. It is a life draining disease. Once you see that you are not the disease — you can be ready for the tricks your mind will play on you. 

Gotta develop a crisis plan to help with depressive episodes. Tons of books and resources out there to create a crisis plan to cope with manic and depressive episodes"
bipolar2,fjnvy9i,t3_fefges,1583515417.0,"How old are you? 

One thing which is hard for to realize is that our brains are like computers. To treat bp, we are messing with the software and hardware. But it’s necessary bc bp is a disorder of hardware and software. 

To combat this- I started doing a brain training app. Bc we have to exercise our brain like a muscle. It has helped a lot. I don’t feel so slow. 

But you def need to work with a psych. Maybe there is an alternative. Find one that you can trust. I didn’t realize how open my psych was to Med adjustments bc of certain side effects. 

We need meds all the time. Even when you feel stable. This is how everyone cycles. 

Best of luck. Feel free to dm me."
bipolar2,fjnvblv,t3_fefh95,1583515086.0,"When I’m manic — yes. 

I also buy sex toys. I try to keep purchases under 100.

The only nice thing is that when you are stable — you realize you bought all these accessories and that they are actually useful and cool. Lol"
BipolarSOs,fjmfnlw,t3_fe6xkg,1583469296.0,"Meds is a personal decision..  I’m bp.

I take meds not only for myself,  but for my partner. If I am not healthy then the relationship is not healthy.  

Sometimes people aren’t ready to acknowledge the sacrifice. You are in a precarious spot. Best of luck."

Ssri meds were the worst for me. Lamictal wqsnt so much of the problem.  

Just be supportive. You don’t know how much I felt like a failure bc I couldn’t perform.  My so supported me so much. Just remember. He is getting healthy for you and the relationship. 

My libido also took a dive.  But intimacy is a two way street. I could always be seduced for sex."
bipolar2,fjmeynw,t3_fe6u9y,1583468761.0,"You’re welcome. 

A huge part of coping with the disease is to understand what it means for your life. The more you know the more you can explain to other people what you have. When people understand they will be soooo empathetic. Because they can finally understand mental illness is. It’s a powerful tool. 

Best of luck to you. There is a bunch of us here like you. And we are some pretty insightful people."
bipolar2,fjm89sq,t3_fe6u9y,1583463920.0,"You can’t rationally will away emotions. Whatever you feel is real. If you could will emotions away, we would all be employed and CEO’s of companies. 

What I learned is that BP is like a computer. Our experience is the “input”. The disorder deals with the “output”. 

Our BP brains lack the correct hardware and software to take the “input” and process it through regular pathways. We process the emotions through irregular pathways and end up in some odd and inappropriate places. 

This is our disease. We have to acknowledge that we can’t change our hardware. We can change our software somewhat. But that is the challenge. Hardware cannot be changed. 

Hope this helps. Pm me whenever."
BipolarReddit,fj2jhta,t1_fj120o1,1582945270.0,"I wish my doctor was like this. They never taught me how to live with the disorder or what would happen to me. 

I have always been med compliant, but still had destructive cycles. My meds had to be adjusted a few times. 

I wish they would have told me that the diagnosis was severe. And how I would have to change the way I lived my life. And that meds would not cure it. And that while it is possible to leave a meaningful and stable life— it would take initiative, you would need to be proactive, and to alert me about the difficulties in employment and school ahead."
bipolar2,fizwvr3,t3_far8q6,1582878217.0,"I hear you about employment. I think a lot of us struggle with trying to keep a job. And I think a lot of the times we can stick our foot in our mouths and get fired. It’s happened multiple times to me. And I think everyone else with bp.

It’s a real shitty feeling. I think you are blessed to have a family so supportive. A lot of people are not that lucky. 

But. It sounds like you want to get on your feet.  I think we all struggle with self-worth. When I was unemployed I hated looking for work. And the work never seemed like what I wanted to do. 

Everyone with bp is in different stages with the illness.  For example.  It took me like 10 years to understand what being bipolar meant. You can get a diagnosis — but it’s hard to know what the disease actually does. After lots of episodes, arguments with my wife and unemployment - I kind of figured it out. But bp wrecked my life. It still does. But I’m working on trying to see how I can manage it. u/owlfoxer has written some ways to manage it in a couple of comments. 

But. I think it’s important we have self-worth and dignity. Eventually- and it sounds like you’re getting there — you’ll want to do something more — something that makes your life yours. Try reading up all you can on what BP is and what it can do to your life. Ask yourself if you want that life. 

Have you thought about grad school? I’m in school and being bp and in school is super difficult — but I am working toward a career that will give me income and flexibility — and it interests me! 

If you have the space and support, I would suggest you make a long term goals. Maybe grad school? Or college? if you haven’t done it? (70% of Students with BP drop out) or a trade school. 

But invest in yourself. Living with BP is difficult and takes so much effort. So much more effort than other people. But it’s our lot. It’s the hand we were dealt."
bipolar,fizeov2,t3_fao3aj,1582860909.0,"Start with something that interests you.  


I’m a dude. For me it’s planes. I started model building planes. Started photographing planes. Watching planes on YouTube .

So just pick something that interests you. And do anything possible related to that.

I like arts and crafts too. Go somewhere new or a cafe and draw.

I just got devoted into something and that helped me."
