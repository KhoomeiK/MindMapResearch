Meditation,fqsk896,t3_gkljju,1589609630.0,"What a profound, telling discovery. It will reveal more about you and how you can find peace. The human mind works in intriguing ways.

I used to have dreams that would direct me to my desires and wishes, and how I could find peace. But now I have no way of knowing, because I am too far removed from observing the mind. Always too distracted with anxiety and worry, and caught in the turbulent waves of rumination. All I do is react to everything. We can provide for other people and help them, but to neglect oneself and one’s own needs is a great wrongdoing."

Edit: sorry for sounding like a fortune cookie

Honestly talk to a friend/family member/advisor. Get some perspective. Don’t try to figure this out alone. You’re likely still reacting to what just happened and listening to someone else will give you a different perspective.

Try to take a step back and look at your efforts. Do you want to keep going? Will putting in extra effort be worthwhile? Or would you be happier/less burnt out/more productive doing something else?

Whatever you do. Make sure it’s what you want to do vs. something you think you *should* be doing."
