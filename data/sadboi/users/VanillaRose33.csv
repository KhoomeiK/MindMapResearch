I use google drive for important dates like when Special Education teachers come in, meetings, big class projects, when my lesson plans are due etc because it sends me a reminder when I wake up and I can color code all of it. I also have a second reminder for the things involving my kids written on my white board and I pray someone didn't erase it.

For my day to day teaching I keep a paper planner where I write what I planned for each day and what needs to be printed and prepped on friday for next week. 

For organizing all the printed things I have a big accordion file that I separate by day and child (for progress reports, IEPs, health logs etc). Art projects however sit in a bin in the play fridge labeled by day (I have no space), usually forgotten and used on fridays for free exploration activities.

Then I have a lesson plan binder that has my master copies organized by subject/content so I can easily find what I need to print at work and save my wallet the 60 dollars in ink.

I also like to make fridays free exploration days or child lead centers so I have an hour or so to sit and organize, create to do lists and get the majority of prep out of the way. Which is really nice and helps me stay organized."
