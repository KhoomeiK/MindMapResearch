Again, i honestly appreciate you taking the time to help me. Thanks TPG!"
askwomenadvice,fph39db,t1_fph31u4,1588614192.0,"And she'll answer - ""cos i think you're a loser. Leave me alone"" :("
askwomenadvice,fph2upv,t1_fph1zmv,1588613987.0,"You're right. So if i say something like- ""hey, im not bothering you with these messages am i? Cos i kinda feel like i am sometimes"" - that would maybe be an ok way to initiate the convo without attacking her?"
askwomenadvice,fph1apl,t1_fph16ky,1588613203.0,Honestly? She's not good with confrontation and i dont want to scare her off
askwomenadvice,fph0yjc,t1_fph0gu8,1588613032.0,"Thanks so much!
So one common thing that been happening lately is that anytime i reach out to her she always thanks me. Yet, i'm still the one who has to text first all the time. I dont mind of course but i do feel like maybe im being annoying. Do you have any experience with this?"
askwomenadvice,fph0ei6,t1_fp9wi3g,1588612750.0,I'm sorry to bother you. Can i ask you one more question?
askwomenadvice,fp9wakw,t1_fp9w4dz,1588435890.0,"Haha- see! I can't help it!

Thank you very much for the help. I wish you good things"
askwomenadvice,fp9v3tx,t1_fp9tw0t,1588435182.0,Why only in romantic relationships? That's intriguing to me
askwomenadvice,fp9tgqo,t1_fp9sx22,1588434208.0,"Hmmm, may i ask, do you feel like you've done that before? Manipulated and leeched off people? Of course, i'm sure it wasn't you trying to be intentionally mean but i do worry about the relationship being one sided cos she is already getting what she wants"
askwomenadvice,fp9sd25,t1_fp9rx36,1588433547.0,"You sound more than just ""fairly"" intelligent lol. But shame on them i agree. 

&#x200B;

That is a good point about not becoming her counselor. I think there is a fine line between being a supportive and compassionate man in her life to being a counselor and i hope im walking that line lol. I dont plan to fix her, i just want to be there for her"
askwomenadvice,fp9qeh2,t1_fp9pwl5,1588432347.0,"Again, thank you very much. The fact that you take this much time to help a stranger says a lot about you. It's appreciated. Though i agree with you that mental health should be treated like physical health, i don't feel i should push it on her just yet. I just plan to tell her that i dont want her to feel pressured in our relationship and we can take things slow.

Ps. im sorry about your bad experience with therapists. Im a counselor myself and i find it disgusting he/she was rude to you"
askwomenadvice,fp9p1f5,t1_fp9lkov,1588431496.0,"Thank you very much for the help and i'm sorry for your struggles.

She is not in therapy. She used to be but sadly, i think she doesn't feel that she needs help anymore. I disagree. I'd love to be ""in it together"" but since its early stages, it does feel like it's more me trying to earn her trust. But that's normal, no? Trust issues exist for all of us. I dont know lol"

Anxiety,fk6hhfi,t3_fghb3j,1583902305.0,That's awesome! Light at the end of the tunnel :)
Anxiety,fjc1x69,t1_fjazcy4,1583206524.0,"Thank you very much for that and i wish you the best during the bad days these disorders  can cause.

I guess i dont want to be too forward with it. She doesn't really talk about her anxiety much and i feel like i f i bring it up ill seem judgmental or even pushy"
