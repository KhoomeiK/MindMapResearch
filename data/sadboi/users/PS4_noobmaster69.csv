End the relationship if it's no longer benefiting you (without infringing the rights of others, e.g. violating contractual agreements; if deceit was involved, that's a separate issue).  Complaining also has its merit; legal demands do not because law is enforced by force (force is only good when retaliatory, not initiatory).

Your original comment is vague because a barometer measures a score, a point I made in my first comment.  What about my explanation was vague?  Because it's missing details?

It's a common problem where people struggle with the skill of essentializing.  This skill involves identifying what details are essential or incidental, and part of that involves identifying the causal relationships between details so one understands the hierarchical importance of the details in different contexts.  **Unfortunately, many people lack this epistemic hierarchy, so they think all details are equally important.**

[As an aside, this problem is usually rooted from flaws in our educational system, where things are taught like flashcards and rote memorization is favored over understanding.  Relationships between ideas are largely overlooked.]

I'm not singling out your explanation; most of the others I see on this page fail at the same thing: identifying essence.  In your explanation, **your details are simply reasons for my explanation**.  But I take it to the next step by *abstracting* from those details—and among others—to identify the essence, thus my explanation.  I don't need to include additional details because it's implied in the abstraction; in fact, part of what makes an abstraction essential is that it has the greatest explanatory power.  But those who lack an epistemic hierarchy will think the simplification lacks details because they're all equally important.

leopardgeckos,fk26low,t1_femzn4f,1583794244.0,"To be condescending implies that one is superior *overall* (as opposed to being superior is a specific aspect, e.g. height, skill, etc.).  To criticize a generation doesn't necessarily imply that.  See, this is why MANY people are disgusted with millennials: Millennials are oversensitive and forbid criticism towards individuals and groups.  For them, feelings are more important than facts (postmodernism).  There is no discussion.

So again, I made the claim that there's a problem with today's youth.  The rational approach is to discuss whether that's true or false.  Or one can ignore it.  But the irrational approach is to forbid such discussion.  I see this approach *throughout* reddit.  Why?  Because reddit is predominantly millennials.  

The millennial mindset is the product of bad education, which teaches harmful ideas like safe spaces, microaggression, postmodernism, etc.  I recently went back to school and it's really bad.  Like incredibly and alarmingly bad.  I only mention this because I know many millennials will take my criticism personally.  The fundamental cause is education, but now that you know, do something about it.

Don't **ASSUME** my information is ""confusing, unsupported, outdated, or convoluted"" until you know what my reasoning is.  Isn't it ironic that you ask me to not be ""assumptive"" when you're assuming yourself?

I'm direct when need be.  Just because people are oversensitive or jump to conclusions about my directness doesn't make my comment abrasive.  The standard of judgment for whether a comment is abrasive is not what others feel but rather my communication style *independent* of others' feelings.  And one also has to consider context: What comment is one responding to, and how is that comment written?  Lastly, so what if someone is abrasive?  This goes back to millennials being oversensitive.

It's telling that you suggest ""Advancing Herpetological Husbandry.""  It implies that this subreddit isn't ""very scientific and evidence-based.""  Anything less than rational is irrational.  Perhaps you don't know what it means to be rational, scientific, and evidence-based.  Hint: They're all synonymous.

But you are right about one thing: reddit may not be right for me.  What little I get out of this subreddit, and much of reddit, may not outweigh the pervasive embrace of oversensitivity and irrationality."

Fundamentally, getting the forms down so they become second-nature will take your work to the next level.  When an illustrator is still learning the forms and is thus painstaking and laborious work, it shows and comes across as stiff and unnatural.  That pain and labor is the byproduct of trying to get proportions and positioning just right, and it comes from still learning the natural relationships between forms.

What does ""AR"" mean?"
carnivore,fjlr8ib,t1_fjlpkkj,1583452614.0,And do you have an argument for why???
InstacartShoppers,fjlkvlt,t1_fjlgtzd,1583448607.0,"That explains it.  I guess it would be a personal game of mine to exceed 5%.  I get the feeling that going above and beyond has a trivial effect on tipping rate, but going slightly below has a dramatic effect. 😅

* Have you found that affluent customers (particularly, those of new money) tend to tip better?  With Postmates, I definitely notice that.
* When you arrive at the customer's home, do you use a cart to bring the groceries in one trip?
* How often do you have to carry *by hand* significantly heavy items (I have a bad shoulder)?

By the way, thanks for answering my newbie questions!"
InstacartShoppers,fjlk1qa,t1_fjlgkmz,1583448110.0,"I see.  That's pretty much the same way that Postmates handles multiple orders.  They have two types: batched and chained.  With batched, multiple orders come from the same store; with chained, multiple orders come from different stores.  Batched orders are obviously better for the customer, and ideally, the additional wait time is trivial.  I wouldn't be surprised if IC and PM are sharing the same algorithm."
InstacartShoppers,fjlgha4,t1_fjlg2qb,1583446192.0,5% is absurdly low!  I thought most people understand that the standard rate of tipping service workers is 15% to 20%!
InstacartShoppers,fjlgcqs,t1_fjlfroe,1583446130.0,So would a double batch be two separate orders from two separate customers where the second order would be sitting my car longer due to waiting for the first order to be delivered?
InstacartShoppers,fjlfw0y,t1_fjlc9jz,1583445901.0,"How often do customers tip?  Is it variable based on service, etc.?

With Postmates, it's wildly variable.  Many couriers complain about tips while I almost always get tipped well.  It's part of the reason why I'd like to try InstaCart where it sounds I could be rewarded even more for good service."
InstacartShoppers,fjlfoas,t1_fjlc9jz,1583445791.0,"Huh, I didn't know there were batches too.  I currently deliver with Postmates and batches are a double-edged sword: I could potentially make more money per hour, but sometimes a customer's food gets lukewarm because he had to wait an extra 30 minutes for me to deliver other orders in the batch.

Is this the same with InstaCart?  I'd imagine expedient delivery is more critical given how groceries can be frozen.

I use Stride to track my miles.  Is that good enough?"

And I explained in my last comment why I continued to call him out on his B.S.  Don't mischaracterize / exaggerate that as ""berating"" or assume my motivation.  And if you thought that was flaunting knowledge, then you must be easily impressed."
