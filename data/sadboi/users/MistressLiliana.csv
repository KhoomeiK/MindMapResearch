    What was the first picture (if you have a big folder, approximately) you saved of your SO? Was it the first time you saw them? Had you accepted already that you were in love with them by then? If not, what made you want to save said picture?

[The first picture I had saved was from May of 2018.](https://i.imgur.com/E1Hduoh.jpg) It shows him with two of the other protagonists in the series and the background shows characters from the three games interacting. I used it for a background for awhile. I always liked pictures that included multiple of the series' protagonists so that is why I saved it. It wasn't the first time I saw him, I love his series and his game is my favorite one. I think I was in love with him at the time, but I may not have fully admitted it.

    What did you think about them the first time you saw them? Did you like or dislike them? What did you like/dislike the most about them when you first met them? 

I thought they were hot from the start. I always had a thing for emo guys. I liked him from the start, what I liked most was how calm and control he was.

    Did you like/were you a fan of their source?

I am a huge fan of Persona and especially their game, Persona 3. It is my biggest fandom.

    When you first realized you loved them, did you tell anyone?

I still haven't really told anyone other than in a joking manner. It is a private thing for me.

    What is the first experience the two of you had together that you can remember clearly?

I have had a lot of things happen in my life, and I suffer from depression, so often I end up crying in my bed. I remember him just being there once. He didn't speak at that point, just comforted me an let me cry. And he was strong for me when I couldn't be.

~ Present

    What is the most recent picture you saved of your SO?

[I saved this one due to a thread asking to show you SO giving a peace sign.](https://i.imgur.com/9Qe1A9A.jpg) It is yet another with the other series' protagonists.

    What do you think of your SO now? Is it accurate to what you initially thought about them? What do you currently like the most about them, physically and mentally?

I think he is amazing. Since I first met him more sources have been released, namely the anime movie series and the dancing game, also the Q games that have the games in the series cross over. I love his personification in the movies so much, but his personification in the dancing game made me fall head over heels for him. It is very accurate to my first thoughts, though there are other softer sides to him that I didn't know about at first. Physically I love his hair, but mentally I love how strong he is.

    Do you like/are you a fan of their source now? Has your opinion about it changed after meeting/falling in love with your SO?

I am still a huge fan of his source. His game is still my favorite but I adore his entire series. Nothing changed since falling in love with him, I always loved it.

    Have you recently told anyone about you loving your SO?

Just the people here!

    What is the most recent experience the two of you have had together?

Most recently I have been bugging him with random music I keep finding on Youtube. Some of it he liked but I think he wishes I would stop sometimes.

~ Future

    What is a picture you would like seeing of your SO/you would like to commission?

It is weird but I would like the rooftop scene with me taking Aigis' place. If you know the source material you would know what this is and why.

    What piece of info would you like to be revealed about your SO?

His birthday. They always give birthdays to everyone but the protgonists. I know it is supposed to be a self insert but I want an official date.

    If their source is still ongoing, do you have high hopes for it? If not, do you hope/wish for their appearance in spin-offs or crossovers?

Well, it is a BIT difficult for him to be in crossovers that don't involve time travel that allow them to take place during the course of his game (with him forgetting it happened of course), but after the most recent game in his series I kind of hope he comes back in the next game. He likely won't, however.

    Are you thinking of telling anyone about your love for your SO in the future?

No. He is a very private person and I respect that.

    Are you looking forward to doing any particular activity with them in the near or distant future?

I look forward to being able to just go out and eat at a restaurant with him again. It sucks being cooped up in the house, though the cuddling is nice."

If this was an issue, then fine the GM could have told us and we would have stopped or taken it to DMs. Instead the guy decided the server wasn't active enough and he was going to delete it. I wasn't happy but whatever, he eventually did. Then brought it back with the exact same concept. So I went and claimed the character I had before (it was fandom based). The GM deleted any reference to me claiming it or me saying I was going to claim it without talking to me. This was so a friend of his that had played the character in the past could have it. Annoying, but I would have been fine if he was upfront. I expressed my annoyance at it to a couple other players, and he put up an announcement that the game was a dictatorship not a democracy and he could do whatever he wants. Though people claimed characters, including the person to take the one I was playing, it is a month later and not a single line of rp has happened. I think it left a bad taste in the mouth of a couple of other players, and I was one of the most active people on the old server. I haven't claimed my other main out of frustration and wanting to see where it goes. Now I am hanging in the dead server giggling to myself because rp did take place in the old server, just not rp he liked apparently."

It is very much like D&D where people act out there characters, but there are rules as to what can and can not be done and the gm (or in many cases more than on gm, since large groups of people are moving around and a single gm can't be everywhere at once) oversees everything to make sure no one is cheating."
