A lot of truth and facts in this video. My parents and grandparents lived under communist regime.

Now as much Nazi Germany and nazis are spawns of evil how are you going to defend Stalins steel hand over his ppl, Ukraine and other countries? How are you going to defend atrocities done by Mao Zedong? Che Guevara and others? Same spawns of evil hidden by ""good"" intentions for the people. 

I live long enough to see hypocrisy, lies and human nature that's impossible to control unless by regime and fear which happens all the time.

Are you coming from anglophone priviliged countries where you drink latte and listen to your professors bullshit and try to preach now to other countries how good communism is like imperialists who want to tell others how to live while they never lived under such circumstances? It's not really directed at you but the ignorant hothead youth in states (where it seems communism is glorified and yeah having no health insurance and other things absolutely sucks compared to Canada or other EU countries) that I also once was.

I still wake up with morning woods though. I still have a sensation there when it gets hard (more blood in there) and get even more of it when it's wet (no rubber used or BJ for example)

Any person with foreskin can pull it down, walk couple months like that and the same thing will happen. I remember the sensitivity before circumcision was sometimes too much and even somewhat painful and I'd finish too quick.

Positives now are that I'm super clean always down there, last longer, it looks better (preference) and I take issue no with it at all.

But If I didn't have any medical issue then I wouldn't do it and I'm an advocate for no circumcision for babies at all!!! Leave it to them. No fucking parent should make such an important decision for their own son no matter what."

Lots of these guys get hurt by young girls and get no attention 18-25 but then women after all fun they had in college look for stability but now these guys don't care because they didn't have fun so they use hypergamy against these women then women get lonely and depressed starting 30+ and it only gets worse for them when guys who got rejected before have stable jobs want fun they missed out on so they chase younger girls. Vicious cycle for both sides. I'm reaching 30s and I notice how women want to lock me down for example.

Got their Death Atlas and The Anthropocene Extinction flags and T shirts lol.

Lately I'm listening to Hath - Of Rot and Ruin album, polish black metal band with great lyrics Mgla - Exercises in futility and Age of Excuse, With Hearts Towards None and their other band project Kriegsmaschine which is dope af too (same vocalist and badass drummer Darkside). Also listening to tech like Archspire, Rivers of Nihil and found a russian gem lately Hieronymus Bosch - The Human Abstract album (they were years ahead).

Cheers bro! Metal for life! üòéü§ò"

These ppl deserve a bullet in the head."
trashy,fg0leqj,t1_ffz40yn,1580410148.0,"And this is how red pill and MGTOW is born. I have friends who had horrible mothers like that, them and their needs were neglected and that would cause them so many problems. Some end up in jail, some end up in addictions, depression, get suicidal and all other self destructive behaviors. Years of therapy are needed and not many come out of such a disaster. Fuck my parents divorced and it fucking sucked and affected my life as it did to my friends.

My good buddy who fell in love in early 30s to this psycho of a woman that had baby rabbies also in early 30s. Got daughter with her and just after a year his life became hell. She weaponizes the child to hurt him. So many women (lower class, hood rats etc) are like that and they don't get called out on that disgusting bullshit enough by other women but also men. This is a case for men of a good heart cause I know plenty of men who are trash fathers also and moms who are incredible."
