RightwingLGBT,fqkq760,t3_gikydg,1589433279.0,I agree with you to an extent. I dabbled in poly relationships when I was younger and I came away with a bad taste in my mouth. But I can also see how certain people could enjoy the experience. I don't appreciate the fad towards polyamory that I have witnessed. I am a therapist and I have had several clients come in and express that they didn't want to be in a polyamorous relationship but sort of felt pressured to be in one. They often cringed when they saw their partner date other people but were totally disempowered to say anything. That stuff really bugs me.

To me it sounds like it might be easier for him to move out, so I think it would be a great idea for you to ask him to do so. You can break up with him if you want, but if you aren't sure about that step, then at least take the step to move out or have him move out. After he moves out, don't reach out to him. Wait and see what happens and if he reaches out be welcoming to him.

AskReddit,fhwakly,t3_etl9ba,1581910610.0,"When I was a kid my parents would take my brother and I to Kings Dominion. At the time, my dad was a raving alcoholic and my mom was quickly deciding to divorce him. I remember this trip vividly because it was one of the last family trips that we had before my parent's separated. My parent's were at each other's throats the entire time and my dad was getting drunker and drunker. Anyway, we went to the water park in the middle of the day. My brother and I were going down one of the slides. I saw him while we were in line and then we were separated. I got out of the pool and walked over to my parents. They were bickering and distracted. I suddenly looked around and I couldn't find my little brother. I walked back to where I last saw him and no sign of him. I walked around the whole area and I couldn't find him. I started to panic and I ran to my idiot parents who were still bickering and yelled, ""Where is Brendon!""

My parent's looked up from their argument and started screaming. My mom started crying hysterically and running around yelling my brother's name. My dad started staggering around yelling. It was horrifying!

We did this for about 30 minutes. I was beginning to think the worst. 

I ran out of the water park in my swim suit yelling his name when I finally found him crying in a police officer's arms. I can't explain the relief that I felt. My mom grabbed him and decided that it was enough and told us to get ready to leave. My dad was totally distracted from what was going on and he didn't want us to go. My mom piled us into the stroller and she wrestled the keys from his hands and started marching us to the exit. My dad made a huge scene staggering after us. Everyone was staring at us. 

She put us in the truck and got into the driver's seat and shouted out the window, ""Bruce! Get in the F\*\*\*\*\*\* car!"" My dad grabbed the bumper with his bare hands and tried to pull the car. My mom hit the gas and he fell over flat on his face in the middle of the parking lot. People were starting to stare and gawk at us. He got up with a huge bruise on his head and defeated he silently got into the car and my mom drove out of the park. I was in such a panic from the whole thing that I shit my pants. 

This was back in the early 90's."

askwomenadvice,f8a1j5x,t3_dnnq8t,1574385247.0,"Google Bikini wax in your area and look for 5 star reviews. Set up an appointment and tell them it is your first time. Take a hot shower a couple of hours before your appointment and take two Advil. Wear loose bottoms. Bring a clean pair of cotton panties to keep in your bag-you might find that you don't want to wear them but its good to have clean ones just in case. The cost varies depending on where you live. In the Bay Area I typically pay 60-80 bucks. Go to a more expensive place for your first time. I am also very hairy, with coarse hair but I didn't have any problems. If you find a waxer who knows what they are doing, they will talk to you to distract you. I like this method, because the most painful part is when you are expecting it. A professional will do it so fast that you will barely be able to focus on the pain. The pain is gone in a matter of seconds. I find that a Brazilian will last me at least a month. I won't be bald the whole time, but the hairs that grow in are very delicate and soft.

After the first two pulls, you kind of numb out. The other thing that made a difference is that the waxer talked to me, to distract me from what was coming-and she was privy to which parts were going to be more tender. The second time I went, I truly didn't notice the pain. There was a shock and then nothing. And for some reason I find it enjoyable. It depends on you and what your tolerance for pain is."

mentalhealth,ewhplv6,t3_cobguz,1565416547.0,"Did you ask them why them think this about you? 

I'm a little confused about what you are doing that is making them react this way. 

Otherwise, I think its okay to trust yourself and going to speak with a therapist at least once won't kill you. If they are any good then they will probably know that you are okay with the exception of your family picking at you. Even then, it might be nice to have some support from a warm counselor around this issue. 

That aside, being yelled at and critiqued probably wouldn't make anyone feel warm and fuzzy. Even if you were in need of support, the way your parents are going about it isn't the best. Seems like they could stand to learn some communication skills. 

Oh! I just noticed that you have a consultation with a psychiatrist. That is a bit different than seeing a therapist. Psychiatrists primarily utilize medications in their treatment. If you go in there and share that you feel fine then they aren't going to force medication on you. It wouldn't be ethical for them to do that. Also, your session with them will be totally confidential so your parents and boyfriend won't be able to advise you on the issue.

mentalhealth,ewhnuze,t3_cod1cl,1565414533.0,"Thanks for sharing. Panic attacks are very interesting phenomenons that are somewhat misunderstood. Many people will experience the uncomfortable physical sensations that you listed. Then often negative thoughts will accompany those sensations. The thoughts people have are sometimes: (I'm gonna die! I can't do this! This is never going to end!) Unfortunately, those thoughts make the panic sensations worst. Then often people will react to the overwhelming experience by backing out of the event, going to the hospital or taking anti-anxiety medication. There is nothing wrong with those reactions however, the downside is that doing those things in the face of a panic attack can unintentionally create a panic disorder. This is when people's lives shrink and the person will avoid experiences that exacerbate stress. 

The crazy thing is that the best thing to do is to ride out the panic. Panic attacks will rarely last longer than 20 minutes. Remember that. A panic attack is a fight or flight response. It is the same kind of physical response that any human would have in the face of any sort of physical danger. The difference between most panic attacks and running away from a tiger is that people internalize a judgement about themselves having that reactions. The negative thoughts will begin to take over. The best thing to do is take note about your physical sensations, your emotions and your thoughts. Try to counteract those negative thoughts with helpful thoughts. Ask your family or friends for support  while you ride out the discomfort. Do some grounding techniques. Don't judge yourself for having this experience. Panic attacks are super common. 

Grounding technique examples: breathe in for 8 seconds and exhale for 8 seconds, Sit down on the ground, go for a run, do some exercises, stretch, find a plant or tree and look at it while you breathe. Keep time via a stop-watch on your phone/set it for 20 minutes. 

I advise that you begin an emotional thought record. 

1. Situation 
2. Immediate reaction (without judgement)
3. Actual Emotion (look up an emotion chart online if you need help with this)
4. Helpful/Soothing Thought

Example:

1. I am at the war memorial
2. I don't want to be here! I hate this place!
3. I am terrified 
4. I'm not in any physical harm. I can call my friend to get support to get through this. This sensation is not permanent. It is okay for me to have this feeling."

I hear a lot about bad parenting from clients. They try to get their dysfunctional families in to family therapy but it is rare that they make the effort. 

I feel like a large part of the mental health concerns in our country lies in the stigmatization of mental illness in the first place. 

Men especially don't want to go to therapy because many of them think it makes them seem weak. Its totally not true but it is a common perception. 

I have noticed in the states that so many people are burnt out and economically stretched which often adds to the poor parenting. It is difficult to parent when you are working 2 jobs and barely home. 

Mental health services tend to be quite expensive. Insurance companies do whatever they can to not pay for services. The low-income therapeutic services are over-stretched. I work at a free/low-income clinic that can barely keep its doors open due to lack of funds and we have over 700 people on the waitlist. We are one of the only places available that can provide this type of service in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

It's a mess. What is there to be done when we don't have the resources to offer?"

I also met new friends by going to volunteer in my community. The benefit is that you feel better about yourself because you are helping someone in need and there are other like-minded people to talk to who are doing the same thing."
venting,ewhkml0,t3_cnjzho,1565411170.0,"I'm sorry. I can understand your frustration. 

High school is really hard. It isn't just the workload but there is so much pressure to perform and be ""on"" all of the time. 

I know this is probably a long-shot but have you considered talking to a school counselor about how stressed you are feeling? They might be able to talk to your teachers to give you a break or extended time to complete your assignments. Most teachers are pretty understanding about that stuff. 

As for your mom, I hope that you two can eventually have a straightforward conversation about what hasn't been working for you. 

I feel for you as far as having trouble sleeping. That is really hard. I would imagine that is making it even more difficult to do well in school when you are so tired. Its cases like these that I wish more parents and schools were more understanding about the need for mental health days off. Maybe you could talk to your dad and see if he would be willing to let you have a day off from school so that you can rest. It would also be doubly helpful to speak with the guidance counselor in conjunction so that they can help you get extended time to complete assignments-so that your grades don't suffer. 

Wishing you good rest."

But there could be a lot of factors about how you are initiating yourself and relating that could be giving off an energy that you don't intend to give off. I'm also curious, have you ever experienced a woman showing interest in you that you weren't interested in? I have heard a lot of stories like that from men who complain about similar things. I always find it interesting that they don't take the hint or they write off the woman for various reasons, (she's not my type, I'm not attracted to her, she has no personality, etc.). In the end, it might help for you to get some advice from a dating coach, just to see if an objective party can give you some honest feedback about the way you approach women."

Shamanism,epsiods,t3_buawdn,1559450405.0,Yes I have. I felt like it was a portal. I looked into it and I was sort of sucked into a different dimension. On the other side I felt like I was being prodded by something mechanical. It was overwhelming.
