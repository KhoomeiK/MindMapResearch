Music,fr5qkoa,t3_gmu9fc,1589912989.0,"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I'm currently in Maryland while my mom has lived in Texas since I was 11. In mid March, when the coronavirus lockdown began, I was attending college in Pennsylvania, and my family (parents are divorced) all decided it was best for me to live with my dad in Maryland for the rest of the semester.

Now that the semester is over and I don't go back to school until August, my mom has begun asking if I want to come to Texas for the summer. I haven't seen my mom since January, but she has multiple sclerosis (MS) and one other autoimmune disease, therefore she is immunocompromised and very vulnerable to the virus. I would love to see her, but I also don't want to endanger her well-being. I haven't given her a definitive answer yet, and she's starting to get annoyed at me. It's hard for me to be away from my mom for this long, but if something ever happened and my mom got sick, I would never be able to forgive myself.

**Please report unverified sellers who respond privately to your buy ads.** This is against our rules, and will result in a safer community for everyone.

Thank you for posting to r/SexSells! There has been a recent **increase in scamming from unverified sellers** who will contact users through their buy ads. For your own safety, we recommend you only work with sellers who are verified on our subreddit. Moderators will be unable to help you if you work with unverified sellers. 

To ensure someone is verified: Ask every seller **to comment on your thread** and check that they have Verified Seller or Trusted Seller flair before continuing. If they can't comment, they may be banned. [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSexsells) with any questions about a user. **DO NOT SEND PAYMENT** until you have seen for yourself that a user is verified. A user who offers to verify for you themself on kik/cam/etc may be who they say they are, but there is no way to hold them accountable in the event that they take your payment and do not deliver services.

**Please refer to the [ban list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/wiki/bans)** before sending a seller payment, especially if they claim to be verified but have not commented on your thread. Many of the ""sellers"" messaging you who will not comment are on this list.
