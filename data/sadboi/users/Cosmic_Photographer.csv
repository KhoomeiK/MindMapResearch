I'm really sorry about how you feel about existence. I can't stop you but I must ask if you've sought out any sort of help, such as a counselor or medication. Whether religion matters to you or not, I will pray for you."

depression,fhxio30,t3_f51oky,1581955258.0,I completely understand; I'm in the exact same situation. My mom lost her cousin to suicide years ago (20+ years) and it still messes with her. I can't imagine what she would go through if I went too. I know family is family but losing a cousin vs a child isn't exactly on the same tier. I'm actually writing this in the doctor's office because last night I was vocal about my thoughts of suicide and now I'm in here talking about anti depressants and the like. Hopefully it will get better for both you and I. I hope you seek help if you haven't already.

Look up the Skyrim soundtrack, they have them for day, night, dungeons, caves. There is alot of other stuff from other games. But if the music is too intense, it takes them out of the game and if it's too short and jumps to a related track but not good for this moment; it can absolutely drag the session off track. I wouldn't use anything upbeat, at all; because it can make the moment way to epic for a skeleton fight. I wish you good luck!"
