That said, reducing the cost of ""entitlement programs"" would be a win for them. Everyone gets the benefits of it but the Yang idea is to keep programs like SNAP in place but provide a better alternative. All of the existing programs go untouched but the bureaucracy behind them will be shrunk as a net result of writing all U.S. citizens 18+ a check.

Of course, this isn't a silver bullet to fix every problem, but it would set a foundation for having more constructive conversation about inequality when the working class doesnt have an economic boot on their throat. 

This is also a net plus for rural states as more money would flow into their local economies - which is why he emphasized the effect on truck drivers, for example. With the rise of self driving trucks the diners, motels, etc that relied on those drivers getting out and having a meal will be completely passed over (like in the movie Cars), 1k would help keep them afloat and maybe bring in new people as their real estate properties are much cheaper than major metropolitan areas."
