It ended predictably - which I don't feel is a bad thing, but it really lacked the tension and urgency that the earlier episodes had as well as Change Your Mind. 

Something that bothered me was how seemingly unbothered everyone was about Steven's behavior? All the growth, Pearl's motherly attachment, Garnet's guiding and nurturing, and Amethyst's sisterly bond were missing to me. Clearly something was wrong with him. Clearly. They know him better than that. They let it get so bad that he corrupts himself and then make it all about them (exception being Connie, who was the only one acting sensibly). I think it's one of those things in cartoons where they make the characters act far dumber than you know they are just to make a point or fit a story.

Mr. Universe: I feel this was a really significant episode. All this time, Steven has looked up to Greg, looked for Greg to fix his problems, reassure him. And now Steven finds out that well, he's not a fraud exactly, but Steven observing Greg throwing away his ""perfect"" upbringing, running away, rebelling, getting a new identity - his *immaturity*, the same as Pink Diamond. Steven now has lost respect for Greg, just as he did Rose. This is extremely bad for Steven, as Greg seemed to be the best person to help him, and now won't be able to as Steven has shut him out. 

Fragments: Steven's actions make a lot of sense. He's literally been *shielding* the Crystal Gems from his destructiveness. He ran to the one person who doesn't need shielding. The one person who can handle him in this state. Training with Jasper was great for Steven, and provided him a way to vent in a healthy way. Also, it allowed him to develop some maturity and perspective. I thought in the promo with his hand in his pocket - that it would be Jasper's gem. I didn't expect it to be fully shattered though. It's astonishing that Steven is literally powerful enough to kill someone. Especially Jasper, who has been shown to be far stronger and more resilient than other Gems. Even though Steven was able to heal her, there is no un-doing what he did. He killed. And now, the last people who can help him are also killers. There's been a lot of mentions on how monsterous, terrible, cruel, and evil the Diamonds are throughout the series, and now Steven has entered their level. I think the corruption will happen to him when he goes to them and realizes how similar they actually are."

They definitely over reacted here. We‚Äôve got one camera up at my moms house which is not visited often and which some people other than us have access too when she‚Äôs not there. Basically it just sends me alerts when someone is detected. If she‚Äôs up there, it gets unplugged. It‚Äôs clearly visible and not hidden at all. 

It‚Äôs a different situation than yours but I would be pretty offended if we had someone over and they got freaked out over it. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre accusing you of maliciously recording them to use for blackmail or something. The cameras are clearly used for your peace of mind and your children‚Äôs safety, and it‚Äôs very presumptions of them to feel like it‚Äôs all about them.  If I go to someone‚Äôs house and they have a camera, I assume that it‚Äôs for security of some kind and has nothing at all to do with me personally."
