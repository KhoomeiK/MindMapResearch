Anxiety,ezsygjx,t3_d25kxx,1568115358.0,"i was quite similar to how you were in 10th grade. im in 11th grade now (in UK thats be entering first year of college) .. and ive been homeschooling since 10th grade as school was too stressful. home educating could be an option for you, even temporarily if you feel too much stress coming from school.

youre having suicidal thoughts, i hear how tired you must feel.. but please please acknowledge thats only how you feel in the day, in the rage of being unhappy with your current life. when youre just standing there, or just walking somewhere do u really feel like dying or do you just want to not be where you are right now? take yourself out a stressful situation in a safe way, not drastic. doing something so permenant as to kill yourself or attempt to would be so devastating . i hope you dont do that at any cost :( i believe in you, and see a spitting image in your words, of my 10th grade self crying for help. if school is becoming too heavy, please! talk to anyone! about changing schedule. i stayed quiet for so long about school causing anxiety, and it was the worst thing.. my anxiety was at a high during school, and now that im at home its definitely being managed better. keep talking to your psychiatrist, more happens in your head that is beyond ur own understanding, another person hearing those thoughts might bring a other whole light to it. its hard but eventually you might open up. its worth the chance. if a genuine diagnosis isnt enough to convince your parents, then theyre unable to understand what youre going through and their opinions dont matter.

your family life isnt going too smoothly.. you care about those people right? stay alive so you can be there for them and see them through to better days. :))

being absent from school then having to face everyone is really hard. i know. hopefully you have a friend who you can trust enough to maybe meet you outside of school? im sure your body can carry you through one more day, just to see if going back to school will be better for you or not. youre stronger than you think!! socialising is not the answer to all anxieties, and forcing yourself to do these things could prove to be the worst choice. but at least know youve tried, and that you cant do it and its okay that you cant.

hang in there love!!! the day will come for you to smile. please pm me if ever need be, any time. i truly care for what you have to say. best wishes to you

edit: i completely messed up the grading system oops"
Anxiety,ezqll9e,t3_d1vff7,1568060884.0,"I take 10mg of propanolol when anxious. doesnt do anything for nervous stomach, sweating, acid stomach. Helps shaking a little if i remember, but doesnt take away the jittery/gut feeling.

I feel drousy or pressure in the chest if I take any more than 10mg, so please dont take any more than that unless your doctor recommends it of course.. its really uncomfortable and brings more nausea.

 It honestly just slows down your heart, as its said to do. And it almost cushions your body from the adrenaline rushes ?? thats the only way i can describe it. but it does NOT stop general adrenaline in the sense of guttural instinct (poop/pee/sick) and nerves. These cant be helped with beta blockers and u probs need a xanax or some shit for that lol

Think of it betablocker as a seatbelt, youre still going to get awful whiplash and extensive trauma from the crash, but hey atleast youre not thrown full throttle through the windscreen lmao. what a terrible analogy. 

I find i can become the closest to calm in high anxiety, after emptying my bowels as much as possible, taking a propanolol and then closing my eyes, clearing my head n focusing on my breathing. You definitely notice that your heart isnt pounding after so long feeling it. Tbh u cant feel ur heart at all LOL i thought i was going to die the first time i took em

I dont want to give them much praise as they are weak aid when in pure panic, anxiety really is an force to be reckoned with. but i still wanted to try list the few positives. While it doesnt do much in the moment, you are maybe 25% less physically exhausted afterwards, as the exhausting heart pounding is stopped.

I also want to take a moment in this long ass reply to remind you that all of these physical symptoms are entirely normal. Sometimes u really need to strip it back and remember the majority of anxiety is literally just instinct- the fight or flight response and theres n o t h i n g you can do except accepting it and giving your best efforts to stay calm in the meantime as it passes. Im sure this is hard to juggle with on top of issues in your everyday life. That takes a lot of strength + youre doing better than you know. 

Do give them a try, even if theyre little help. its better than nothing, and might just save you when you need them!! Hope this helps :)))"

Definitely leave some kind or encouraging messages, but don't expect a reply .. i wouldnt recommend going to visit, as she may take this as invasive and make her more anxious. Space and time are the best offerings - letting her know youre there for her whenever shes ready, but never take a step too far towards her in her anxious states or force a contact with her. She will initiate a meeting or chat when ready. If you know her family, ask them if shes okay, or for them to check up on her. :) she will come around soon enough, dont give up on her!!"
Anxiety,ezjmlhy,t3_d18zrz,1567946935.0,"I enjoy watching asmr channels who talk to you as a friend, a few faves are Latte ASMR, Karuna Satori, CrushOn9 and Goodnight Moon

Chatroom games or servers can be fun -- i find myself playing IMVU a lot nowadays, as you can dress up so confidently + it feels less vulnerable to have an avatar represent you. 

Might sound boring to you but; crosswords, wordsearches, coloring books. It doesnt matter how old you are:P expand your creative brain\~

I also go on Duolingo, its immersive and requires most of your concentration, and you benefit from it too with a new language. 

Srry thats all i can think of atm :( I wish the best for you!!"

Im generally anxious to begin with so in headphones I become 10x more on edge / jumpy even when someone moves in the room -- no idea why!! Id only guess its instinct to be aware of whats around u. i only feel calm listening in a busy room with just one ear in the headphones.. keeps me grounded
