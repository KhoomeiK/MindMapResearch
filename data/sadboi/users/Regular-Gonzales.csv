AskReddit,ete7wsu,t1_etdabe1,1562725224.0,"I'd forgotten about that scene. I just rewatched it and I kind of wish I hadn't. It's way too relevant right now and the [YouTube comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOYbx32NeUw), edgelords or not, don't help."

SixFeetUnder,es7zoa6,t1_eralovj,1561684325.0,"Nate was actually really resistant to going back to the business until Claire convinced him: ""He would do it for you."" There's no denying the truth of that statement.

Claire is my favorite character. I love this scene because it shows how perceptive and wise she is - she knew David needed help, she knew who could help him and how, and she knew exactly how to persuade Nate to help."

AskReddit,er4nddr,t1_eqijd55,1560499933.0,"Not a recruiter, but I am in a similar boat right now, in my first ever full-time job where I have received two promotions in the company in 4 years. I think it's all about how you sell it. You most definitely have skills if you worked your way up to a manager position. Think about how to list those skills on your resume in a way that can apply to other industries."
TrueOffMyChest,eqjlf22,t3_bykplp,1560107011.0,"I admit I didn't read all of your post, but I want to offer some words of encouragement. I dropped out of my MSc program when I had completed everything but writing the thesis. It had become an extremely toxic environment for me for all of the reasons you listed. I do believe my advisor was at least mildly abusive, at least to me, and I saw very negative behaviors and attitudes carry over to his other students as well, which were then inflicted on me (or at least it felt that way). I didn't fit the mold of a grad student because I didn't constantly talk about my research, and I didn't want to work every minute of the day. More importantly, I *couldn't* work every minute of the day without my sanity unraveling. I needed support, and I had no support (but to be fair, I should have asked for it and I had no idea how to do so). I began to hate everything academia stands for, and I wanted to get away from it as fast as I could.

The fact is that it's a system designed to put enormous pressure on everybody. It's a highly competitive world because of a shortage of funding and of original ideas. People who simultaneously feel self-important and tremendously insecure because they pour all their energy into hyper-focused research that, for the vast majority of researchers, has no bearing on anybody or anything. Probably the saddest thing is that it breaks people like you and me, who just wanted to perform research and explore ideas but then find out there is so much more politicking that goes along with it. I know many people who had full-on breakdowns at one point or another during their Master's. Most of them still pushed through, but it was a really hard road for many of them. I think that is proof of the system at work - and between that and the constant shaming and berating of other researchers, I simply can't get behind a system that thrives on tearing people down.

I felt like a failure in many ways for dropping out, but I also had several people tell me how brave they thought it was for me to recognize when something wasn't serving me and wasn't a positive influence on my life... and just walk away. I still remember the freedom I felt when I finally decided to throw in the towel. It was like the world was new again, and I could do anything I wanted to do. I wasn't trapped in the confines of academia anymore.

If you love teaching and mentoring, consider teaching at a community college like a friend of mine who just completed his PhD but absolutely despises academia. He gets to teach people from all walks of life who are in it for reasons beyond meeting their publication quota. Teaching is a great joy for him, but not within the context of academia that only encourages people to keep getting higher and higher degrees so they can stay in the system. You might better enjoy teaching those late starters, those people looking to advance their careers, those people taking classes just because they find it interesting.

Like you, there is so much more I could say, but I wanted you to know you're not alone. There are endless things that you can do with your life. The most important things I learned from my grad school experience are that it is never worth it for me to sacrifice everything else in life for my work, and that there is no reason to stay in a situation where you are desperately unhappy. (Caveat: you should try to make it work. If you have really tried to make it work and it just isn't working, it might just be time to move on.) It's not giving up; it's refocusing on what you really want your life to be."
QueerEye,eotws8j,t1_eoslaam,1558850827.0,I dig it. His personality was so different in S1-2 that I didn't know how to feel about the change. I'm glad he feels more comfortable so that he can act as he really is!
QueerEye,eot2bii,t1_eospmcx,1558833784.0,"Interesting! Thanks for sharing. It was such a change in personality that it read as fake to me, but if it's just him feeling more comfortable being his true self, then that's awesome."
AskReddit,eot1syp,t1_eord40a,1558833532.0,"I got tired of it sometime into S2, when every episode started having a formulaic Big Emotional Speech. Sometimes more than one."
