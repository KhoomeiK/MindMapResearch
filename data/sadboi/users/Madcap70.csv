vipassana,f0v3w1k,t1_f0v3d5z,1568962289.0,"It’s kind of hard to describe and it was a combination of things. A big part of it was somatic OCD, since vipassana is about observing body sensations, I became hyper fixated on parts of my body and non-conscious processes like blinking. It was absolutely inescapable, I couldn’t focus on anything else and it was incredibly intrusive and distressing. It also dramatically changed my sleep pattern and I could hardly sleep, I was stuck in a state of hyperarousal. I hoped it would go away on its own but it only got worse over time and I don’t think there would be anyway I could’ve gotten out of it without help from meds. Since you mentioned having OCD that’s why I caution against going on a retreat. Being in isolation and stuck with your thoughts so long can be a bad combo for OCD and exacerbate it. I feel like mindfulness has still helped my OCD but that retreat ended up being way too much for me to handle."

I even had to be on antipsychotics for a while. It was a painful and difficult transition, but now I’m better than ever and am still on antidepressants over a year later and don’t feel like a zombie at all, quite the opposite. Don’t give up.

Just don’t beat yourself up if you end up feeling like you need to leave early. I found my first retreat very helpful, but long story short after my second retreat I ended up in a mental hospital, I think because of my OCD more than anything. Just be aware of the risks, PM if you have any questions. Have you tried medication? Therapy? There’s a lot of factors in being a mentally healthy person, meditation is only one part of the equation. Best of luck with whatever you decide, don’t give up."
