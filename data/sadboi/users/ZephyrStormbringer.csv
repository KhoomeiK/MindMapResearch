realwitchcraft,fq0nw37,t1_fpxzhq4,1589034901.0,"I don't like the rhetoric of the 28 day cycle either. I think we lost a lot of ancient wisdom regarding women and the moon. I maintain that when women are synced up with the moon cycles, the wouldn't bleed every full moon, nor every 28 days, but with a combination of the season and cycle of the moon. So if a woman goes out and simply observes the position and look of the moon, and is not on birth control, she will likely bleed on the full moon in the hot months and bleed in the new moon in the cold months. There's probably even more factors, but it certainly is not accurate to say it's typical to simply bleed every 28 days and every full moon... it simply doesn't add up. This is why it's so important to keep a personal almanac that includes moon positions and your personal cycle days. The nuances start to actually have patterns as well."
realwitchcraft,fq0mq59,t1_fpwmpwl,1589034410.0,"Same here I can be crampy and irritable during mines too. I'd like to add something that you might want to keep in mind as cycles go on are the seasons. Every individual is unique and based on various factors, women who sync up with the moon for some time like myself for example, have found that the seasons also have something to do with my cycle as well, and not just the moon or the month... For example, for the past 3 or so years, I have been bleeding on the full moons during the spring and summer and during the fall and winter seasons, I actually have been bleeding on the new moon. I believe this has something to do with the seasons- when spring begins it heralds new cycles of growth- so to ovulate as the moon is growing is symbolic of a growing child in the womb. The bleeding on the waning is to start anew for another opportunity. During the winter months when food is more scarce, and the season change to quiet contemplation to survive the quiet colder months, it makes a lot of sense to me to feel more magical during the dark moon of the cycle in the winter time when resources tend to be stretched out. I am sharing this with you because I think you are tapping into something there with your preferences. This winter you may find yourself syncing up with the dark part of the moon cycle, and also explore why you feel the ""most"" magical time of a month is the full moon and what that means to you and why it's the ""most"" or best time of the month and how to best interact with that feeling or notion. You may find that the dark part of the moon is the ""most magical"" time of the month (in the winter for me) for you anyway. I want to share with you that the ""most"" magical part of the moon cycle is the part that serves you at the present. In other words, there's magical notions in every cycle and season, with a variety of uses and purposes. 

""Saving"" everything for a ""most magical"" date may aim and miss, not getting another chance for a whole cycle... or you can work with what you have and what is around to the most benefit at any given time chance and opportunity. For me, this includes exploring the positive and negative forces of life and to understand them beyond how they may influence me personally. I'm hearing your logic as ""what a waste of a full moon to be bleeding"" but I'm here to nudge you to explore how powerful it may feel to bleed right onto the earth next to a water and fire element in the cool night breeze on bare skin on a full moon... any other experience under the full spring moon pales in comparison. Of course there are social notions against such behavior and actions, and that is why I bothered sharing all this at all... it is my opinion that society frowns upon any ""animalistic"" or natural behavior that's not confined or regulated. Yes my period causes me pain, but it also provides pleasure. 

The veil is thinner in the beginning of my cycle, so whether a full or new moon, provides me with an extraordinary sense of direction to take in my personal affairs. Women are natural shamans, who are told and taught not to enjoy anything about their periods and to regard them simply as a burden or discomfort, when in reality, we shed life force regularly and that can be tapped into if not pushed into a non specified gender box of tampons that society is most comfortable with: silence."
realwitchcraft,fq0iqy1,t1_fpwo7u6,1589032472.0,"Same here! I'd like to add that I am most moody and bloated (like the waxing of the moon) right before my monthly and during it, I feel lighter and more in sync as I ""drain"" my uterus lining, as the moon calmly wanes. It's a consistent visual reminder of the ebbs and flows of the life cycle. I believe the benefits of syncing with the moon is like riding a wave as a surfer... there's a certain ""high"" in getting closer to a bigger understanding of who one is in the world and that we are a part of a bigger system all working together. It certainly is comforting while having issues like cramping etc. to remember that that cramping is signalling my body to function optimally. A cleansing of sorts that just occurs naturally like the routine maintenance people tend to in other aspects of life willfully, it's kinda neat to be in tune with one's own ""maintenance"" routine. I too feel cuddly like a sad homely puppy haha nice description I'm on day 2 of my ""moon"" too. I know once the flow comes so does the relief of my irritable mood and discomfort from being ""full""."
casualiama,fnsly0s,t3_g3kvt9,1587224326.0,"It's okay to be naked; intentions matter as well. If you intentions to be naked is because it is more comfortable, that's perfectly okay. A moral dilemma may come about when you are ""going naked"" for social and monetary gain... and your comfort level with that specifically. It's the old ""find work that you love doing"" dilemma more than about nudity itself in this case. It is work after all, and the effort put into that work is showed to some type of consumer/client/customer base. Just like any other business, it's about supply and demand; serving internet consumers might get exhausting quick. I wouldn't do it because of the sex work world comes with it's disadvantages, such as people being abusive toward the sex worker to name one thing. Another is that 250 a week is peanuts. You could make more money doing something that you could be proud of for your entire life. I'm assuming you're young, and an issue with sex work is that sex and nudity is available for free and it's freeing to engage in such activities. 

If you get used to putting a price on your sexuality and nudity, then you may miss out on opportunities to explore how it feels ok to be naked and sexual and present with or without another person without the promise of monetary gain.  It's like asking if an artist would sell the rights to their sketches and when they turn around to sell the final draft, they can't as easily because their likeness has already been sold off for peanuts. Are you doing it because you enjoy the artistic process or are you into making drafts and selling those off, even though your likeness is being spread around in the meantime? Make sure your art and intellectual property is being ""sold"" or ""viewed"" for what it's worth. The artist has those sketches or practice art projects, but they are typically private, but could be sold for a fraction of what the final image would be. Like the sex worker, you can sell your likeness for peanuts or make it into something that lasts and stands the test of time (nikki minaj's backside is a hard image to forget but it was used to sell her music). If you don't want your current art to stand the test of time, what would that project look like if you did want it to last forever with you into the future? For one thing, whatever your actions are, you live with yourself every day so make sure your choices agree with your values and principles as a person in general. No reason to beat yourself up with secret shame, etc. I believe you can be creative with your nudity whether privately or publicly. Nudity by itself doesn't have to be the means to an end however."

rapecounseling,fkxmdt3,t3_flaa8u,1584631146.0,"Isn't a bit premature to contemplate such a decision? My loved ones who have passed I wasn't able to attend their funerals... at the end of each day, we have our choices and decisions to make from those choices. Whether or not you attend his funeral is a decision you will have to make when it's time to make the choice. If you choose to not attend, it's not ""wrong"" just as it wasn't ""wrong"" that I didn't make my family members' funerals. It's not just about the person who passed, it's about your own life and what would be doable for you, as well as what that person means to you. If he passes in CA, you could just as easily skip it without also having to feel guilty about the life he had and your life with him etc. being around the family etc, it can be a simple logistical issue when the time comes. This way, you can personally ""skip"" out on having to deal with those mourning him and not being in the same mindset/feelings/etc. without having to make it because of that per se. That could save your own feelings from being misunderstood and protect yourself from those that refuse to understand where you are coming from by avoiding that time altogether. It helps to also not make it about him and what his shortcomings are as a person, and instead focus on your health and well being by realizing that regardless of those facts, that you are simply too busy and not in a place to drop everything to attend a funeral etc. Feelings change with time and make sure you aren't setting yourself up to feel guilty about simply not wanting to attend a future funeral (i.e. ""That's not what ""nice"" people do which I am, but then again this wasn't a ""nice"" person""---this is a restrictive line of thinking, and while valid, it's not the only issue/reason/logical point there is to consider/focus on)... make your decision and fortify it with other facts that are easier for others to understand. The day comes and you may feel the need to be with your parents, and perhaps even say goodbye to that person for closure etc. despite everything you all have been through. He can't hurt you once he's gone, but the people he leaves behind will be hurting still from him perhaps, including you and your folks, so keep this in mind as you decide where you need to be when that time comes. It might feel good to plan on reconnecting with your parents after they arrive at a new page in life after the mourning period, etc. Make plans that serve yourself and prioritize your whole self and needs as well as those that you care about. Things to think about and I hope you are well."
survivorsofabuse,fkt3hky,t3_fkdfnm,1584505203.0,"I would like to observe something from your post: you seem rather thoughtful and like most of us, have had a handful of pivotal moments in the backdrop of our mundane day to day life that stick out as having major impact on life in general as to who you tell yourself who you are. You have an internal dialogue that can be restricting or understanding. Make sure you are boosting your confidence and self esteem every step of the way. The good news is that you are reflecting in a way that can be helpful to living the life you want. You realize the cons of your early love life and are comparing those experiences to your current one, which is rational to build from to avoid pitfalls and issues, and here's a ""pro"" to having your own unique experiences in life: you know how you've navigated issues before and now you can be more quick to identify issues in the present and change the path you're on. This is NOT to say you should feed your negative feelings per se, it's to say that the struggles you may be having presently may relate to your spirit reminding you of things that you struggled with in the past as a catalyst of how you can change things to represent how you want to work with those issues in a new, perhaps more constructive way in your current circumstances. I am here to remind/inform you that your private world can be maintained at a respective distance from your more public/relationship oriented person/a in a way that ""saves"" you from collapsing it all into one. You are at another pivotal moment in your life age wise and to be able to recognize that you are ""YOU"" privately, no matter how you presented in the past or presently publicly- that is a faction of who ""You"" are holistically and wholly speaking. 

When I was 18 I was the same way, in a similar circumstance. Looking back as well as seeing many other young women having similar experiences and issues surrounding relationships and private struggles etc., I want to tell you that your feelings are normal- it's a transitional point in your life as far as figuring out who you are which won't be really set in stone for another decade... you have time to figure out and discover who the adult you is. Don't be scared or ashamed; use these intense feelings to do something that you can be proud of. If you are worried about school, master your lessons and finish it up... do things that you can for sure look back on and say ""even though that was going on, I still managed to \_\_\_\_\_\_"". So even though you're super anxious about your relationship, it may help you to use that boost of ""what another thinks of me"" to privately be working toward greatness. You have time to live your own life privately and maintain your relationship in a way that you can choose to share the parts of who you are comfortable enough with sharing with another, and that's wonderful. Keep in mind that whatever you are giving to this relationship is not the totality of who you are as a person. Get busy and feel fulfilled in other ways that relationships don't tend to have: personal hobbies, spiritual understandings, and other things that you may be able to share with another but if not, are comfortable in doing all on your own. That's the beauty of relationships: people have the tendency to connect and disconnect at will. Use this to your advantage rather than not."
witchcraft,fkku8oi,t3_fj19u9,1584292052.0,"You have a great opportunity to at once explore the validity of your beliefs and faith in a community of faith based beliefs that are validated. Rather than being at odds with your social location, community, and family practices, you could try and recognize how the predominating religion is kind of habitually and naturally practiced by some and kind of forced and unnaturally practiced within the same group... there's a lot to learn and glean from your very community as it pertains to how you may want to practice your personal and private spiritual beliefs. For example, because you are close to this particular faith to may be able to discern those who practice in fear, in faith, by habit, or by choice, etc. and may be able to discern for yourself what path you are taking or tend to take with your own private beliefs. Do you have to be ""open"" in such a way that leaves Christians who are ""open"" (read: annoying) about their faith, practices and beliefs that leave people wondering if religion is more an OCD thing or a spiritual thing to that particular individual... I'm suggesting this to give you some wiggle room in your community to be able to unknowingly influence one another to lean toward finding spiritual commonalities than differences. From there, you can in general see that people are just people and in order to be at the most comfortable with your beliefs and practices, it's important to recognize and practice respecting others' beliefs and practices as a way of exploring and understanding how in turn you may want to deal with others perhaps criticizing or misunderstanding your behaviors or beliefs... we all do it and it can be a way to connect and communicate what's typically not when we come from a curious standpoint. Hope this makes sense, the ""tip"" being to comfortably practice and explore your spirituality because to a certain extent that seems to be the ""norm"" in your community. You need not label it ""witchcraft"" or ""wicca"" or donate yourself to some random Greek figurehead per se. to get closer to what you are comfortable with holistically. By acknowledging what is understandable and what is a ""head-scratcher"" to you when it comes to your family's spiritual practices, you can then move to a place to understand what would be considered similar notions in your own exploration and devotion to spirituality as it pertains to how you perceive others in their faith based belief systems to be. For example, if it's odd to you that your community has devoted themselves in such a way to one particular notion, it is not a bit ironic that you go right to considering devoting yourself to a similar notion and practice of directing attention toward a particular figurehead that represents and symbolizes some ideal you desire to achieve? Different label/figurehead/ideal, but similar in practice still. The more you recognize similarities between you and others, the more at peace you can be with your own self, practices, beliefs, and confidently practice them without feeling like an ""other"". At the end of each day, we need each other and we don't live on a private idaho. It's great that we all don't agree exactly, for that would be the most boring reality! Good Luck and Happy Spring! P.S. it's so fun to participate in Spring community activities, even if produced by the faith based community: the ""pagan"" earthly vibes that underline festivals and gatherings at heightened seasonal times are alive and well everywhere you go. Tap into the beautiful vibes all around you."
Genealogy,fj70tct,t1_fj6yzw6,1583084119.0,"I did note that, also noting how informative this record of birth (""certificate"" or ""registration"" of) is in general. Like, my own birth record doesn't contain my father's occupation, etc. This record contains many potential clues, especially the 4 dates from Oct-November... what's that all about? It does seem more like a legal document or registration rather than a birth certificate- which leads me to believe this is some kind of early abortion record- hence having a ""birth"" registration to be able to record the medical conditions, treatments, and outcomes surrounding the pregnancy. Again, I agree with your findings and I'm seconding them. It's hard to say without finding the death certificate- if not one, then again, it would point to an elective abortion or otherwise noting medical history of having had an abortion in the past, but that would make the least sense. Suggestions to open pathways of possible stones to overturn."
Genealogy,fj6wbij,t1_fj6p8wh,1583081554.0,"My understanding is similar: I had a natural unexpected miscarriage and it was officially termed as a ""spontaneous abortion""... So while I think you are correct that ""miscarriage"" is not a medical term and ""abortion"" is, I still think the difference between an (elective) abortion and spontaneous abortion is the choice involved... my guess would be that she went in for an abortion and the fetus survived or possibly died shortly afterward... hence the birth certificate. Otherwise I would research the person in question to see if there is a death certificate as well for them. That would possibly be the case in a ""spontaneous"" abortion- the baby was coming earlier than expected and then likely did not survive. In either case I'm curious what the outcome of this birth was. This was a time where eugenics was popular and there was abortions as well as birth control methods taking place. Just because it was illegal doesn't mean it wasn't going on in otherwise legal contexts, such as being performed by doctors, etc. Margaret Sanger would come on the scene 14 years later opening the first abortion clinic in New York."

For me, I loathe running as a form of ""committing"" to an exercise regime. However, it's fun to sprint or jog from point a to b if I'm warmed up and feel like it. Good for the heart. I would suggest playing around with what you like so it becomes second nature and so the benefits would be not having to ""decide"" between perfectly great forms of exercise... just do them when the feeling comes on. If it feels right, keep doing it; if you loathe it, there are other types of exercise that can positively affect the brain and body. My go to is clean-dancing to loud music: I get boring chores out of the way, get my heart going and move faster, lifting stronger, etc. and before I know it, an hour has passed, the house is clean, and my kids and I are having a blast running around, dancing, karate chopping the air, etc. This ""warm-up"" inspires me to continue an exercise whether it's more aerobic karate moves, dancing to a good song, or maybe even busting out some push ups and squats if the desire comes on to do so.

witchcraft,fitw2dj,t1_fitoca2,1582730622.0,"I find it compelling that many kids in religious households go to rebellion is to attack the family religion. It's like how some kids of alcoholics don't drink a drop of alcohol themselves and others follow in the footsteps and become alcoholics too. Parents need not directly teach their kids habitual tendencies; those things kids pick up on all by themselves... the more complex and strange, the more intrigue and taboo that seems to surround that activity. It's not that she did or did not teach you to be religious or witchy, the clear message that you seemed to have gotten is that this particular book may have held more power in connection to your parent than your parent did to you, causing simple communication defects, which would enrage any child. How do you feel about that action today? You may be interested in reading Fahrenheit 451 it's a dystopian novel surrounding control via burning books so that there is only one particular way of thought readily available. I'm bringing this up because simple rebellion is almost always tied to an inner struggle- one that wouldn't necessarily translate well if that rebellion was institutionalized: it's the struggle of a dictator. While we don't need to subscribe to those written down by others, to burn another's work is destructive activity that symbolizes one own powerlessness by the mere exposure of another's ideas. We need not be so weak willed to be that affected by another's thoughts, beliefs and ideas. We have our own unique ideas to construct and write down for another to read and perhaps agree with, inspiring themselves to be similarly constructive and so on. Books are good. Destruction is bad.

witchcraft,fitucf8,t3_f9s1pz,1582729589.0,"Not at all is it weird that a \_\_\_\_ believes \_\_\_. All of it is merely labels at the end of the day. Supernatural intrigue and religious interest are two different arenas, even though they overlap in some circles. You never should have to base your own personal beliefs on a prescribed role or label in the world. You can be and believe and practice anything you want to. I'm serious- no matter what it is one can always find a critic. We need to worry less about what others think and believe about us, and prioritize what we each personally believe, practice, and be, and as long as you're not hurting anyone, nobody is going to hurt you unless they decide to and that is out of your control and if someone does physically, mentally, or spiritually harm or wound us, we can again, look to our own system of safety and belief system to know how to respond without compromising our own sense of self. Opinions are just that- everyone has one. You need not to believe in something you don't, and if others don't align with your exact beliefs, that's par for the course, not some exception to the rule. We are all unique individuals that hold various beliefs close to ourselves.  One's insanity is another's creativity and so on and so forth, there's not a one size fits all label, so we should not even give credence to labels that only serve to generalize and cause hurt and confusion. 

I think it's great that you are searching for a deeper meaning- just remember that your journey need not be necessarily at odds with ""religion"" or anything else you've personally witnessed and experienced- that too is part of your journey, and you don't need to keep it as it was (JW is a cult I escaped from!), you can mature your opinions on your own experiences (There may have been some good in all the bad, I am who I am because of my experiences); it is a part of you on some level and so it's important to not simply ""reject, rebel"" but also come full circle in understanding your social location beyond the limits of religious upbringing etc. and come to an acceptance to be able to get deeper in complexity and meaning in general (i.e. ""religion"" may have put a bad taste in your mouth, but try and remind yourself that this isn't everyone's experience in their religious upbringings, so it's wise not to generalize from a particularly bad experience because you are attaching and limiting yourself by looking at life through that particular lens and framework. Is it all religions, is some of your experience unique to JWs, was it your particular family of origin? These are personal questions to ask yourself sometime, I'm sure  you already have... all I'm suggesting is that it is possible to see yourself as you. Not the JW you or Athiest you, but who you are as a total person. It might be interesting to detach from labels for a moment to just see how you feel without all the prescriptions... the answers will reveal themselves to you the moment you stop trying to fit into a label and start finding what fits you like a glove- a belief that doesn't engulf you, but is consistent nonetheless. Nobody can for sure tell you what you need to feel comfortable in your skin and your life other than you yourself- you hold all the keys to your life. Good luck friend!"
quantum,fir37pq,t1_fiol9p0,1582656468.0,"Fair enough. I was trying to hard to sound cool I think maybe... what I meant with "" a reorganization of where collapses into singularities happen every day with every choice we make"" is this: I have tried to find if there was like a quantum app that would effectively help me understand what quantum decisions look like I guess. I think it was Sean Carroll on the Joe Rogan show who was explaining the game I was looking for, in which it sounded like a simple 8-Ball toy idk if you had one but you ask a question and shake it and one face of the dodechedron? of preloaded options would reveal itself as the ""answer"", but the key difference is that with this ""quantum"" game is that one considers that the ironically ""yes and no"" limit would conveniently project the other pathway into some other place of existence... all of this is an issue with me personally because we could so much easier look at ourselves as a prime example of a living quantum being. 

If we consider for a moment that there could be less of a ""many world"" projection going on with wave functions, and more of a subtle but in the same world wave effect in the environment within every singularity collapse in the form of everyday decisions that are entangled with that decisions of yesterday that are already being entangled with the choices and possibilities of tomorrow... our reality is less ""8-Ball"" ""checkerboard"" style and it's more like those are simple games we play to understand decision making processes, but not necessarily how life occurs or how quantum functions process decisions etc. It's only hinting at a possible option and only then bound and restricted by that option not being able to consider similar or parallel options... we'd have to be able to process all of the possibilities at the same time and take the best and be able to meld them together to create the actual quantum collapse of a decision. I believe we do this naturally but it's obviously hard to be able to measure. I hope this makes sense to someone, because it would be nice to be able to say some things about\* quantum mechanics, quantum physics or quantum computing in a way that is interesting but obviously accurate in theory as well..."
quantum,fir0air,t1_fipt0wt,1582654807.0,"Thanks for your feedback. I realize that I may have been collapsing the two ""new"" computer ideas in the pipelines but I was really trying to discuss this what you describe, not an AI computer but a quantum based computer that can handle accurately searching the large database of DNA data for example, to then connect to a digital computer for the answer in question. So right now, it takes a genealogist tedious work to come up with a fairly accurate family tree representing a person's heritage, and it's not often that they can reach back more than 100-200 years in the past. Wouldn't it be cool for the genealogist to be able to take a person's DNA sample, run it through the quantum computer to compare with other DNA data and also taking the information found and comparing it to records available on the personages in that family, to come back with a completed idea about what is running through your veins in a medical, genealogical, and biological lens?

Neurology is another branch of science that will benefit from a quantum set up of understanding I believe. I get that digital computers are able to store data, but quantum computers may have the additional ability to pluck out which choice will actually make a difference in the answer to the question, discarding the data that doesn't. I will try and articulate my thoughts in a different way: if digital computers operate on arrays of yes or no decision trees, then quantum computers may be able to operate between those yes or no decision trees, revealing the ""why"" or ""why not"" in every decision made. So if there is always a spin up or spin down choice within every 1 and 0 decision, there should also reveal additional information as to why ""the evil twin"" decision did not work or was not collapsed into the singularity of what is. Because of the additional directional possibility, I just feel like there is something there that can be utilized for actual family trees for some reason...

My understanding of quantum computers so far is that the arrays? are set up in a way that there are more pathways than simply 1 or 0, yes or no, on/off- manual thinking basically. Anyone can perform what a computer can- albeit tedious, doesn't really ""wow"" because the decisions are already collapsed, pre-loaded, and understood. In quantum computers, every qubit is like a little personage: the decision has yet to be made, there's a choice to be had, the environmental input to always be considered. A living quality of movement as oppose to a strictly digital type of movement. It's quite restrictive...

 If we imagine all the archaeological digs that have had their DNA successfully extracted being in one convenient place, for example, we could start comparing modern DNA to this database. People are already doing this manually, but what if it could be done automatically? It would be like siphoning through a world population to find the answer of ""who was the predecessor of person A"" and the answer being revealed. Because of the biological structure of reproduction, this aligns perfectly with how I understand quantum computing being able to collapse many possibilities into one singularity answer: every living person is an example of a singularity within the range of all their ancestors combined. Recombination is similar to collapsing of the possible choices, and so on. Endogamy is like an amplification of DNA in some geographical areas, and decoherence is found when a family line weakens and dies out... If we think of ourselves as quantum beings, we see our own heritage amounting to singularities looking into the past present and future. All that to say this: with every yes and no decision that is made, there was effectively that quantum collapse that would have occurred before those ""found"" pathways were made available as the ""best"" choices possible. With AI, this needs to happen so that vehicles ""understand"" that it's not ""enough"" to get to point A to point B in the most ""effective"" way possible, but there are factors along the way the will effect even the most ""effective"" route, in the quantum world this is amplifying and decoherence (wave function) or entangling with the surrounding environment rather than operating in a strictly digital capacity... 

The perfect example I think is a person: every person can be thought of a quantum being, and the ancestors before them are entangled within their very DNA structure, continuously interacting with the environment- places and other families, etc. We can look at a pedigree chart and it resembles a tree with roots if the person has reproduced and it extends like a wave, perhaps collapsing where aunts and uncles died young or did not reproduce, etc...

Suppose we could create algorithms that allow to create using these two ways of computing: one is prefabricated in the yes and no positioning, and the quantum computer makes use of the decision trees symbolically wrapped within each predetermined yes and no positioning... so rather than moving through simple arrays, we could move through more complex ones (and zeros lol)... which would give rise to things that we are only beginning to discuss..."

quantum,finhrqm,t3_f8tmex,1582563582.0,"Anything practical that the public makes use of often enough to improve upon it in strides. It's not enough to say the theories of quantum mechanics have given rise to our cell phone data capabilities, because it's a given when you buy a phone. You don't have to know about quantum physics to operate your cell phone or search your computer. Yet, our technological advances are only so because we have begun to scratch the surface of possibility. Back when radio was new, I imagine the reason why there was so many radio stations, clubs, and ham radio activity is because the technology was put into the hands of people to find ways to make practical use of it. There needs to be a social component to it that makes it for lack of a better word, ""trendy"" enough to actually put some thought, creativity and hours of activity around it to be able to ""show off"" to an ""audience"" that actually cares enough to be interested and perhaps involve themselves in knowing about it.

In other words, quantum computing will be the next radio, television, internet, phenomenon the moment the novelty use of it becomes understood... specifically, my idea would be in the ballpark of computing innovation, beyond the typical stock market and prediction visions we are seeing, and more in the realm of applying egotistical apps that more accurately tell you about yourself...

I envision biologically based quantum computers having the ability to perform on the spot DNA sequencing if you were to provide a sample. So there could be a main computer and apps you could download that are connected to that one which holds raw DNA data in quantum amounts (which is a lot!) So when you take the personality quiz, it could tell you about your personality in comparison to other real personalities as well as tendencies you may lean toward or away from making one more conscious of their own choices and self. Rather than a quantum decision maker where people envision many worlds theory, it really would be a reorganization of where collapses into singularities happen every day with every choice we make. Bringing quantum thinking into play is also important too so that people can play with the concept of quantum physics in their daily lives. Rather than thinking of ourselves as digital biological beings like we did in the 20th century to understand digital technology, we are now in the 21st century, and can just as easily liken ourselves to quantum biological beings and all the metaphors that are to come with that to help us all understand what quantum is and what it has to do with our own selves and why we should all give a hoot at all.

But more to the point, I wish there was a computer like this, so that when one ran their own DNA through it, an app could output a beautiful and accurate family tree spanning further back into history than one could if they were to work on it for a lifetime. That would be something wouldn't it?"
remoteviewing,find857,t3_f8lxbk,1582561146.0,"I think I may have by accident... it was really strange and it was like they were remote viewing me too or more like our ""wires"" were ""crossed"" and briefly ""saw"" one another in the ""astral realm"" but when I'm in a peculiar state of mind this so called astral realm is more apparent and very much in real time just beyond the so called veil... to articulate it is difficult but these personages seem technologically advanced shadows from my experience(s). It is like they are a personage in trench coat and hat, but move like a video game character or android and clearly a phantom or shadow but somehow physically there too, and weirdly sentient. It's almost as if it is a technology that is capable of behaving like a person as to allow for more physical, emotional and mental experience in the user whom is quite literally controlling this thing remotely. 

I realize this is the remote viewing page which is a particular skill set, but I personally believe remote viewership is to tap into the more broad ""astral realm"" in a specific way. To use a metaphor,  we can compare it to taking a taxi, driving yourself, walking, or riding a bike when choosing to travel some place. Remote viewing would be classified as ""taking a taxi"" in this metaphor, when one is holding a target to be interacted with and another accepts the ride, whereas driving yourself would be like astral projection, walking a place is the slowest but most expansive journey into the astral realm, and riding a bike is to be on a mission whilst taking the scenic route. I saw these guys while ""biking"", ""walking"", and ""driving"", in the astral realm, but not necessarily during a ""remote viewing session"" per se. (Possibly because I do not typically involve myself in remote viewing specifically, but still find the discussions in this subreddit to be interesting and revealing in their own unique ways.)"
paganism,fin76tz,t3_f8jdjf,1582557379.0,"Many. From the Christian/Western perspective, ""paganism"" \*is\* idolatry, but that's simply an ignorant collapse of ideas. Also, idolatry in the Christian perspective is to worship and to love things like man made objects more than God and the natural order. Again, to Christians, any spiritual activities that don't involve the Christian doctrine are ""pagan"" activities. From a perspective within ""paganism"" however, idolatry is not a thing, and neither is a ""pagan"" religion- for these concepts belong to Christianity.. Observing the wheel of life for example is a ""pagan"" tradition- it's not ""worshipping"" or ""idolizing"" anything at all; it's simple observance. Idolatry as a concept is basically taking Christian symbols and doctrines and turning them upside down to rebel against it- it's all within Christianity as a religion. Pagans do not seek to disturb others rituals, they simply practice their own. This is the key difference that gets confused. Satanists would be simple idol worshippers because they worship god-like concepts within the confines and limits found in the doctrines of Christianity. People who observe pagan rituals have no ""beef"" with Christianity and it does not actually cross in a spiritually combative way that idolatry makes explicit use of."

Genealogy,fi7crul,t1_fi4l06s,1582218863.0,"That was my point to your point- it could never be a  ""we"" or ""us"" ""white people"" to pay reparations because that is similar to the fallacy that was committed in the first place: all black people are \_\_\_\_\_\_ all white people are\_\_\_\_\_... it's ignorant. I'm saying you're right- reparations wouldn't simply be taxed or based on descendants of the slaves because like you know, many descendants of slaves were slaves.  ""White"" people actually aren't a thing... if you wanted to get down to the nitty gritty mostly English people were slave holders on plantations during that time (and the ship faring Dutch). The English simply grouped other light skinned people in ""their"" category to distribute some of the sin and blame and shame committed through slavery in my humble opinion. 

I'm not actually saying that's how it should or would go with courts and paternity etc... I'm saying we can't get more nuanced in the conversation because of the whole ""reparation"" issue. While I'm not saying there should or shouldn't be monetary reparations, I'm saying there needs to be a whole research and investigation done on statistics, who's who in the nation today etc. Rather than a tax on ""white people"" or some kind of tax payer trust for former slaves, there could be a non-profit organization started, similar to the D.A.R. and S.A.R. that would work to fund raise, collect, research, and help those whose ancestors were affected by slavery. There could be a trust set up through that organization where those could donate to it. Rather than go straight to taxes, we could see that we are all in this together and there's other ways to heal and work toward healing that people are motivated to contribute to.

Genealogy is a great place where history can be uncovered and interpreted in new ways that have meaning and connection for many beyond race and place. Politics aside, we can start to have more nuanced conversations beyond ""white people"" (those descended from Southern slaveholders) owing ""black people"" (those whose ancestors were enslaved): the truth is that these two particular groups are likely more closer than not, and therefore should work together on this to at least recover the lives of those enslaved and give them names, dates, families, and histories. That's what really matters: recovering and honoring the lives that were silenced and lost to time due to slavery: without them we wouldn't be where we are today. Many fought in wars for freedom, and spent their lives toiling this soil: we need to honor these Americans and give them more of a legacy then simply having been slaves. Their descendants prove they were and are much more than that: brave, fighting spirits that endured major hardship and  survived enough to tell about it. Not for ""reparations"" but to be known. These are people, souls, ancestors, who deserve much, much more than simply monetary reparations paid in their name."
Genealogy,fi78oo6,t1_fi5hljt,1582216550.0,"This is exactly where I am coming from as well. I too have been contacted by a cousin- who informed me about the situation- our direct grandfather ancestor slave owner is who we have in common- but my grandmother was his wife and her grandmother appeared to have been his slave. There are no excuses for damage that has been caused that still lingers around in evidence today. My point was not so much about ""who"" owes ""who"" when talking about reparations- it's to become more intimately aware of what the losses and damages were and are in reality and truth. This idea gets scary because of the idea that descendants of slave owners should be the ones to pay, but that doesn't necessarily make sense given all the reasons, from many slaves being descended from slave owners as well to people descending from slaves also didn't really have a say about it per se either. However, there would be other ways and resources to account for what was gained in another family as a direct result of another family's losses. if there are former plantations kept and run by the state as a museum or historical significance, then qualified people should be able to benefit from those types of profits. There are many ways to realize the damages caused and how those can be recovered using the resources we have now as a nation."

To continue to ""whitewash"" as you aptly put it by ignoring, minimizing, or overlooking an ancestor because they were a slave owner doesn't do those who were effected by slavery any justice. To keep the pieces we like and to discard or not include parts we don't like is to commit the whole ""winners write history"" issue. We need to be brave and objective enough to realize that history can be learned from and to know right and wrong is an ethical signpost that we can be comfortable with our heritage and ancestry but not be binded or blinded by practices that were ignorant or downright evil. It's extra work to be sure, but I think we all need to practice this because where we don't it's almost like aiding and abetting the slaveowners rather than holding them accountable by letting that be part of their legacy even if it's embarrassing or shameful."
Genealogy,fi4h2bw,t1_fi3yr2s,1582141041.0,"Here's something to think about as well: if a child conceived in rape, goes on to live a life, and the rapist is convicted of the crime that he put upon her mother, and her mother is no longer alive to receive the reparation, shouldn't it go to the child of the unfortunate circumstance? Of course it should; it's not her fault that's the circumstance that brought her into this world. Would you ask this child to ""pay herself"" for her father's crime and the losses that comes with being her mother being a victim? You can think of it like child support. The reality is that many slaveholders conceived children and abandoned them, even sold them and enslaved them. Not only are these the worse ""fathers"" in history, the damage they left in their wake is comparable to every father collectively that has abandoned their child since then. It's destructive, and essentially, those ""fathers"" should be held accountable, child support or otherwise in reparations, theoretically. So no, when the descendant that can prove that their slave owner ancestor is a direct ancestor of theirs through a conception of one his slaves, then they were a direct victim of slavery and therefore should be first in line if any reparations are distributed. The slaves that were able to have children together and were forced to be apart are also a major issue within slavery and losses from it, but it's very complex and too easy to be dismissive and ""joking"" about this issue, but we should steer clear of doing so where we can."

Yes, and no. Yes that this is the case, but this example is a bit biased. It doesn't ""lessen"" the pain knowing that one of your ancestors was indeed a white slaveowner, I would imagine it worsens it- like confirming the horrific stories of slaveowners raping and conceiving with slaves only to sell their own offspring- in some cases the siblings would be the ones to ""buy"" a half sibling recognizing their own face and not wanting them to have that life any longer. It would be kind of like having ties with a suppressor but also being suppressed by them- doesn't help that the conversation seems to go right to, well  ultimately, ""you're own ancestors were slaveowners, for shame upon you"", when shame is the last thing we need right now to continue to heal the broken parts of yesterday."

It's like being a tourist; sure you may feel invisible and anonymous in a new place, but you are still representing who you are and where you have come from, so it's important to not make the travelling just about you, but to look around and appreciate the place and souls you come across as well. This can have more meaning than just being a tourist, you can be a diplomat, explorer, etc. This may have been a personal message to not be so selfish in principle, basically. There is a thread of connection- be more selfless and open (vulnerable, honest) with others from the beginning and this will be a more beneficial path to where you want to be. This way you aren't cutting your nose off to spite your face.

ptsd,fh3cha8,t3_f18z9g,1581267420.0,"""They're"" not taking away the word victim; it's a word used in police work as well. A victim is a person that was just assaulted, a survivor of an assault puts the situation in a different context. It doesn't mean that a survivor isn't also a victim, it means that they aren't actively a victim of the perpetrator because they got away. Mentally one may still feel like the perp's victim, but physically, the assault is over typically when a person has become a survivor of the assault. Victims identified as such are already dead, sadly. Survivors live through something that could have killed them and has been the death of others, but they escaped avoiding becoming a total victim of a particular type of violence. It's not to compare rape and murder, but it is to realize why labels are functioning the way they are. ""Vics"" are at the most extreme, nameless bodies to be identified; Survivors are able to identify the perpetrator and bring them to justice, or at least get away before becoming a ""vic"" found at some crime scene. To realize that one could have been even more victimized in a situation but escaped or survived, one may realize that they aren't a just a ""victim"" of violence they are also a ""survivor"" of that violence. Victim past tense, survivor present tense. The difference is that one can make more meaning out of the assault than what the perpetrator did- that is not the totality of the situation nor does the perp's perspective stand alone: to the perp a person they have assaulted will always ""their"" victim. To the victim, however, they shouldn't see themselves that way even if they tend to due to the assault. That's part of the healing to see the difference: one is not what they are to a perpetrator, or even what they are to investigators of a crime (victim or survivor of an assault) they are so much more than that, before during and after the unfortunate assault situation."

Sometimes rationalizing with you waking state what you are doing in you unconscious state helps get the waking state on board and in cooperation... like a metaphor of a parent to a child... you can stop ""silly behavior"" and prevent the worst from happening, or you may choose to helicopter parent: watching over the silly behavior, again stopping it as soon as you sense danger, or you can let the child make their own mistakes and learn from what they are trying to do, something you may not be privy to, something that may unlock deeper meaning to what seems like a silly endeavor. Who knows, you the parent may learn something from the child who teaches you the meaning of silly behavior beyond what your parent eye perceived them to be capable of achieving i.e. something that pays off in skill: dancing, acrobats, extreme sports, etc. that sparked from a natural behavior one enjoys engaging in: feeling the music, using physics to your advantage, etc. So whatever it is that your parenting style is to your astral body, make sure you have good open communication to let it take a chance even in the face of the risks the ""parent"" body worries about... hope this long winded metaphor makes sense.

The situation is not different, the vision is. The higher consciousness operates on principles, and the consciousness operates on rules. Put them together and you've got values. 

The idea of surprise to me can be taken to understand this feeling of not being in conscious control but the goal is met just the same (such as driving from point a to point b on ""autopilot""), which can bring us to the understanding that our subconscious is like a backup system if the consciousness isn't ""on"" in a moment it ""should"" have been... which can possibly mean the subconscious is always ""on"" absorbing the environment and it's surroundings even when the consciousness is not, i.e. while asleep and dreaming. It is less like a conscious sphere of observed and unobserved because it's possible for the ""observed"" or conscious side to observe it's subconscious at work (auto pilot driving again) and also the ""unobserved"" side would be a misnomer as well because the subconscious is in fact observing probably more deeply than the conscious is... we all are conscious enough to find meaning together and that's really fun to observe!"

You can go inside something you effectively helped build, and use it in a meaningful way, to sleep in, etc. Like the consciousness being steered by autopilot: the auto pilot is the building that holds more meaning and uses than what your consciousness may or not be focusing on in any given instant. Yet, it's relatively stable to be able to ""go into"" and extrapolate meaning of what the consciousness is doing in the present. Behaviors and beliefs may or may not be steered only by the conscious or subconscious, but rather they work together to find purpose and meaning. We are responsible for our actions in the sense that we can look at motivations, intentions, emotions, needs, wants, desires, aversions behind and surrounding those actions. We can choose not to, and again that is a mix of conscious and subconscious desires toward a particular action or behavior. The more habitual and repetitive something is the more obvious an alternative process and ""programme"" if you will becomes either available or obsolete of meaning, i.e. one continues to engage in the behavior and the subconscious gets on board with comfortable reasons to enable that, or one finds discomfort in a behavior and the subconscious also gets on board and feeds into reasons why the consciousness might find that to be so just as well. Hence ""steers"" not ""drives"": you are in the driver seat and can choose a different path and direction to take, even if it's the long way or a shortcut or the scenic route etc. It's a team effort of sorts in engagement and extrapolation of meaning."

We ascribe labels but that's not necessarily the totality of any experience. Again thanks for sharing this beautiful piece."
rapecounseling,feekh9f,t3_eop15n,1579035576.0,"Can we take a moment to explore and unpack those feelings? After finding you from another poster's thread in rape counseling, I want to try and be an active listener for you, and also comment on what I'm seeing from my perspective. I can glean that you feel victimized by another male, and as a male yourself, there's not as in depth and broad community and resources that you feel are adequate surrounding this particular type of assault. I agree with you that the social norms surrounding rape and victims of rape or decidedly gendered in a way similar to calling all people collectively ""mankind""... well there's women too that aren't being included or counted in that word, right? But also, mankind is inclusive of all people ""man"" or not... similar to the world of rape counseling... it's all ""her"" and ""she"" when theorizing about sexual assault victims... but we must keep in mind that we can easily glean the general ideas by simply replacing those pronouns with the correct ones that fit our situation and feelings, as well as continuing to expand research and theory about male sexual assault victims. I definitely can understand where you are coming from because I agree and see it myself that male sa victims are not as openly and freely discussed as female sa and child sa victim based discussions are. 

However, the raw feelings of wishing if only you were this or that wouldn't have changed your situation and there's no way of knowing anyhow; but that is a typical and common feeling for sa victims no matter who they are. if only i was this, then that wouldn't have happened or if i was this and it happened then people wouldn't have victim blamed/shamed me. This is what the metoo movement is really about at it's core. I am hearing the same thing from sa survivors as you, and the specifics are always what they're not, rather then realizing that is our trauma talking, making us foggy to simply understanding that it was our body, as we are, who we are that was assaulted. It's difficult for people to express such raw emotion diplomatically, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try and really listen and read between the lines about what is at the heart of the discontent. It's being assaulted and then reliving the trauma by trying to wish it all away by taking our actual self from the equation. This looks like many things, including wishing to be someone who would be more likely to get justice with the least amount of embarrassment in doing so, or at least for me anyways. 

All that to say that it doesn't mean that you are less a victim or less deserving of justice or anything like that simply because lack of understanding or acceptance in the culture or society. That is a systemic issue, not a personal one, even though as you can see how re-traumatizing it can be not receiving any kind of relief, whether in the form of a community of support, justice from the perp, or simply understanding and a place to talk about it without being somehow blamed or shamed or alone. Believe it or not, this is truly par for the course for more sa victims then not. There is a thread of continuity surrounding blame and shame and self worthlessness with such an unfortunate experience. But you are not alone. There are others in this world who have been where you have been, and there's nothing to be ashamed about. We need not speculate who sa survivors are or should be in order to get justice from being assaulted and rather be there for one another in a time of need, no matter who they are or what that looks like. 

Please consider being considerate of others who have been in a similar situation as you have, despite who they are or what they look like; you know how it feels to experience something like that and how ignorant and cruel such an assumption is, and practicing empathy has a way of healing one's own soul when you can see your own spirit's hurt and pain in another beyond their flesh and vanity and comfort that area if you so have the opportunity to do so. It can have a positive effect on one's own healing sometimes.

Sociological theory tells us that in every feeling and every circumstance we have ever been in, especially the ones we feel nobody else can ever feel or have gone through themselves, that we are not alone and the world is so big that the exact situation and feelings have been experienced by another at some point. Please consider looking past ""who"" other sa survivors might be when discussing your trauma in favor of realizing there is others who have been in the same situation as you, from all social locations. We can support each other even if we are differing genders or have differing particulars surrounding our assault. We can be there for each other, including helping you devise a plan of action to get justice if you so seek it. We are here for you friend. if you ever want to talk you can pm me and I will respond to you with warm nonjudgmental support. It can help to have a third party shed some light on a situation and if you think that might help you, I'm here."

They hold a story, experience, pain, but are they opened wounds or are they scars? Scars were once fresh but at the point of being a scar, enough time has passed to have absorbed into the whole as it's final resting state. We don't need to actively reopen the scar back into the state of being a fresh wound to understand what that mark symbolizes or holds, because it wouldn't be a good idea just to explore it more. The point I'm trying to make is that we have the ability to heal and even though reminders remain, they take on different meanings and understandings as time goes on. Your scars are so because yes they were once fresh open wounds, but now that they are scars, or otherwise ""with you now"" how can you carry on with those scars as a part of who you are without being defined by them? Lord knows I still have problems with my c-section scars and while I know we are talking metaphors, the point remains: I am not defined by my scars. They are there because of my journey, and are a part of my reality, but I refuse to succumb to what has amounted to a non-life threatening injury and rather than literally seeing my scars as a literal tragedy I cannot survive, I must figure out how to carry those scars with me without additional baggage that could threaten my protecting those scars from becoming infected and breaking into open fresh wounds all over again. Just some things to think about and I truly hope you find a similar sense of peace. Read: it's not faking happiness; it's more like a stark realization that if I don't count my blessings constantly I may as well be miserable at all times and nobody deserves that reality is all. If you ever see the memes with Robin Williams vs. Billie Eilish it's more like that: was Robin ""faking happiness"" or was he simply looking at the beauty he has surrounding him in the midst of feeling the painful scars that were also creeping around? It's too easy to say 'fuck your happiness' without realizing the damage you could be putting on another vulnerable person even if you feel totally justified in doing so. Please try and be understanding to yourself and others in this hateful cold world. It's all we got going for us as humans"

The difference is that positivity is constructive and negativity is destructive. My thoughts aren't fake, they happen to be positive... it's possible to try and be objective as we can when exploring our situations is all. If we rely upon hateful feelings of anger and disgust, we are at risk of developing a negative habit of having an cup overflowing of such very feelings. I urge you to reconsider such habits in favor of a cup overflowing with positive feelings of love, trust, happiness, and understanding. We don't have to deny our negative feelings, it's just that we don't need to be defined by them either."

Think of all the people it took just to get you at your present social location. Generations of people; so if the world didn't want you in it, then that would have made itself clear by now... you are the child of the world but you are not bound by it. Free your spirit and realize the world is a flawed place for us all; yet we still strive to carve a little niche in it for ourselves. It's okay, you belong just as much as the rest of us do, and don't let yourself convince you otherwise! Get busy in doing things that bring you a sense of happiness and feelings of content. If ""the world"" doesn't understand, it's ""the world's"" loss- but realistically i think you need to explore the world a bit before assuming the worst. You never know what you've been missing until you find it and it's always the last place you look (because the search ends and you find it). Good luck friend, whatever you are going through right now, you can find meaning from it and learn by it and try and build upon it in a constructive way.

You assume, but again, nobody knows my worth or my emotional state but me. I am just a person who has hurt a lot in my life and it's simply easy for me to see another in that particular state. You don't have to hurt, and you don't have to take another's assumption of you to heart. It can be hard to believe this, but I'm here to tell you that we all deserve happiness, even if it's elusive for people like us who have been through trauma. I think of happiness like a chocolate cake; no I don't have it everyday, and I'm okay with that is all. I understand that when I taste happiness, it's a treat, a little something different from the daily bland meals, etc. We are going to get through this dark day, and we can inspire each other to work past the heartache long enough to taste that chocolate cake. That's all. I agree with you it's not all rainbows and sunshine and it's easy to get caught up in feelings of sadness (and in that state it's all too easy to lash out), and whatever we feel is real, but we need to get to a place that we can feel our emotions without being controlled by or at the mercy of them."
rapecounseling,feeatid,t3_eonsrg,1579029944.0,"I'd be curious about what the steps were internally for you from the time you were assaulted to the time you decided to sue him, and the thoughts during the trial, and finally how you feel your choices helped and ways it didn't help, etc. Basically if I was going to buy and read your book, as a survivor of a similar situation, i would want to know about the ""road less traveled"" so to speak, or the path i didn't take and then vicariously be able to insert my own situation in your journey to see if i may glean anything useful from your actions in the meaning department as well as to see what would happen generally if i had taken that route... so i would want heavy descriptions of what you were going through mentally during the trial and how you feel looking back on it all now, and given what you do know now, how can you advise the strongest direct path toward your personal healing that others may be inspired by. for example, what was he guilty of and what was the sentencing, and if you were judge, what you would have done differently or similarly, etc. Good job for getting to a place where you can openly discuss sexual assault with others, even those who aren't ready to understand (see the thread with bramplepatch).

This person did nothing to you nor owes you anything and your expectations of them is inappropriate. When we work to push shame on another, it's simply a reflection of our own shame; we all don't heal the same way, but it's important not to violate another on the basis of feeling justified in doing so. The Cycle of Violence is real, and i suggest you look into that theory for some ideas of what you could be doing to others habitually and not realizing that you are the one hurting yourself by attempting to hurt others."
rapecounseling,fee7qck,t3_eokyyz,1579028128.0,"There is nothing to be ashamed about. Now that you have accepted what happened, you can also release yourself from the shameful feelings surrounding it. Just remember, they love you, they know you, and they probably have a couple stories to share themselves that might be similar to your situation, your mom in particular. You are still young, but it's truly awesome that you are already in a place to be confident enough to want to talk to your parents, adult to adult. i just recently had a similar conversation(s) with my own parents about my own situation as a teen and it only took about 10 years. The way they responded help truly get me past this situation because all that was lingering around was those exact fears: how my parents would be upset that I waited so long to tell them, and yes they offered to get the police involved and I did decline which they are understanding about. Yes they are upset, but not at me, at the situation. Any parent would be. That's okay, they're not going to be upset at you, any upset will be that their precious offspring was hurt by another, which probably is okay to share in those feelings because they are valid. It's probably already difficult to go on with this on your mind and not tell them; parents have a way of understanding and finding helpful ideas. I would start off by saying that you have something troubling you and you'd like to talk to them about it. Also maybe mention that you figured a,b,c, and that's why until now you didn't say anything but now you would like some help with what happened there and what to do now in your current relationship etc. Just remember that it's typical to feel embarrassed about anytime anyone violates us, and it's more intimate when it's sexual, but it helps me to remember that if anyone physically assaulted me then I'd run to my parents for comfort. A physical assault that happens to be sexual is different of course, but similar in the way that it's an attack that hurts and it's not our fault that people choose to act and behave so egregiously. We don't get ashamed if someone is beaten up even if we feel shame surrounding it, we still realize that the person who attacked is obviously disturbed and the victim didn't deserve such an assault. It's harder to hide a black eye, and so it's mentioned. The injuries of sexual assault can be more ""invisible"" but it's still there, and we need to be our own advocates to make sense of the private circumstances of a typical sexual assault. It helps me to think of sexual assault as a physical assault in general: it's easier to explore and talk about for me when I think of it like that without having to talk about ""sex"" per se and the weird feelings that topic can bring up that's distracting to the assault that took place. Hope that helps. Good luck and i feel you are on the path of healing to be at a place to want to talk about it with trusted people in your life. I hope 2020 is a year to remember for you friend!"

I say this because this obviously uprooted a lot of trust you had for this person and it has spilled over into other aspects of your life causing stress and anxiety, etc. I believe that you were a good boyfriend- probably too good for her obviously and it was good that she showed her true colors early on relatively speaking and that you found her out rather than you not and her continuing to use and abuse your trust. People can be ugly sometimes, but try not to let that drag you down with them. You will meet someone who gives you as much as you give them in love and respect and appreciation. You deserve that, we all do. What she did you cannot change, but what you can do is realize that you dodged a bullet not making any more investments with kids with this person or you may still be tied to them. Take the good with the bad and realize that it's her loss not yours. By the way, good job for standing up for yourself and finding the truth and facing it. At least you got justice in the form of catching her red handed- avoiding the additional heartbreak of her getting away with it for sometime and finding about it later on... your story reminds me of a cheaters episode and I felt so sorry for the guy but it was obvious that he was with a gold digging skank who probably preyed on a man with a good work ethic to take care of her as she basically slept around... it may give you some perspective if you watch it and others like it your self. While it's incredibly sad to be cheated on, it's even sadder that the person would behave in such a shameful way in the first place. You did nothing wrong, she did, and probably would have done that no matter who you were. It's her problem not yours. The sooner you realize she did you a favor but giving you a reason to cut ties with a toxic relationship together, the better you will be in the long run. I hope 2020 is your year on the path to happiness and satisfaction friend. Don't let this imbecile ruin your life and stop you from meeting someone you can trust in.

psychology,fe433vm,t3_enmf9d,1578855311.0,"That's like asking why people practice extreme sports and not just regular sports... it's a rush that comes with a certain confidence in a particular area and a desire to push those limits a bit further. Some people like to play a certain type of sport than others, just like some people practice a certain type of sex more than other types. It's a preference in pleasure and engagement in activities. Not very complicated. Psychologically speaking, we have to be conscientious in not forming prejudices based on the ""extremeness"" of an activity; from an outside perspective it can look like an emotional instability issue from the likes of Borderline personality disorder or narcissism, while on the inside it's more like stepping into such an emotion that might mimic such known classifications, but outside the circumstances of the activity perhaps would not apply. It's part of the release and faith in one' own abilities that keeps the emotional part stable and in control in my humble opinion. If one looks at a skateboarder or parachute glider and the first thought is ""they must have a death wish"" I believe is more of an internal issue of imagining a circumstance in which they would be doing something like that themselves which may or may not be accurate to another's perspective and experience during the same activity. Similar to seeing BDSM activity (esp. on the screen removed from the actual theatrics and circumstances of the performance) one might think ""why would someone participate in something that has a risk to hurt them from where I can see"" You never know a place until you walk it, and it's difficult to know ""what it is"" internally and with broad accuracy without experiencing it yourself. So called ""extreme"" activities are simply an active exploration of what it is to be human and a desire to feel things outside of the routine day to day emotions."

They will take your natural enamel and replace it with something stupid like porcelain. Be very conservative with your teeth and do not let the dentist go ham in there. The worst thing you can do is go in there for real reconstructive work and mention how you'd like to get fangs... they will likely not focus on what needs to be done in there. Take it from me, I mentioned how I'd like to get my fang sharpened and the ended up taking part of my fang away ""accidentally"" during cosmetic work on my front tooth (I think they tried to sharpen it and f'd up and because I was novacained they thought I couldn't feel what they were doing etc it was horrid)... they have no idea how to do this properly to get the look you are going for so it's better to not focus on the cosmetic part of looking like a Hollyweird vampire. Just bite stuff with your fangs more often to get the look you want. YMMV but I wanted to give you an example of how that went for me. Go in looking to sharpen your fangs or for your work but not both at the same time is my suggestion. They are people too and make sure they have their priorities and plan made before going in with the tools. You can confuse them into trying to ""help"" but then end up getting unsatisfactory work that cannot easily be redid. Go small and go as often as needed until you are satisfied and then if you still want fangs, mention it outside of other procedures to be done. They do one thing at a time; reconstructive is not necessarily cosmetic and cosmetic is not necessarily reconstructive so they will likely do one or the other so do what's needed first."
AstralProjection,fe3nues,t1_fdzs5v6,1578851180.0,"Rather than purchasing something, you could also theoretically create something better. The Gateway Experience is kind of like the Jimmy Hendrix Experience; somebody created an artform and sold it to the world without selling the secrets of how you can create something just as powerful and full of meaning on your own. Rather than memorizing the songs and reproducing them on guitar, the gateway experience asks us to do the same thing: reproduce another creator's steps for the same experience they had, but the problem with this is that the creator's vision is the beginning and end of what that experience is. Taking ideas from a master is better than copying the master. Finding the major keys and turning them in your own door as the gateway to experiencing something new is what the focus should be on. The Gateway experience is like a template or a draft; other scholars can come along and improve upon it. Reusing the same formula won't get the community further in advancement. So be careful in just thinking you can buy another's experience or work and make it your own.

Start a coven with your friends who you see as equals in ""vampire"" knowledge and whatever else, sure. Don't walk into something that you think you know about only to be fooled with exactly your ideas... That's how people get themselves victimized. Watch Unnatural on netflix and you will see what I mean. It's not a coven, it's more surrounding a ""company"" but it's the same premise of many ""covens"" that are trying to get members... In this series, there's these pitiful human beings playing scientist and end up convincing another within the same realm of gullibility and desperation as they possess to be their guinea pig. Completely unaware of how they may be perceived by the general public, they prance around and feel powerful in this moment of successfully tricking another to do their bidding. It's clear they don't know what they are doing based on their true intentions with their charlatan scheme through the manipulation they must rely on to convince the guinea pig to keep volunteering as a subordinate but being titled something else for the public. It's hard for him to say no (after the other members are now giving up on the scam and showing guinea pig the reality of what's behind the curtain as they are feeling the heat from the authorities) and ends up injecting himself again solely from pressure of the leader. People who are the weakest links in society sometimes try and be a master (read: not leader) of the other weak links in society, rather than climb out from underneath of being a weak link themselves, in favor to be a stronger link, beyond their initial comfort zone. It matters not what the group is focused on, witches wiccans vampires- today's charlatans run covens, try to wow and deceive those who are weak willed enough to join- sometimes even paying to be there, only to then have them captured and controlled by another rather weakling in society, which is double the deception and embarrassment for the victim when it's all said and done. 

If anyone is interested or curious I run a vampire page but it's no coven and I don't believe in covens, they are good only for the leader, for the rest are sheep to feed on. Beware. I believe in egalitarianism and free exchange of ideas and knowledge. Whoever tries to be a leader and doesn't see those in ""their"" ""covens"" as equals- well they need it to be that way or they won't feel powerful in this world at all; but together a real group of focused individuals can rise to great power beyond their social locations. Beware of covens who don't treat you like an equal, a person, or is on some kind of high horse... Unless for educational purposes to see what I mean, do not ever lead with your ignorance and gullibility (In this scenario you'd say something you know is ridiculous and see if it's echoed back to you as truth). The more self aware you are, the better. If you are going into something new, and if something doesn't feel right, hightail it out of there. Don't let little petty social pressures stop you from protecting yourself. You may not be walking into a straight away torture and sacrifice scenario, they may get you to willingly volunteer first, and if they're good, you leave on your own and come back again and again perhaps even saying thank you can I have another? If anyone finds themselves in this situation, run.

OccultConspiracy,fdekmo8,t3_ektikk,1578341034.0,"Throw away the story books and burn them? Haven't you read Fahrenheit 451 and why burning books and other works from humans in history is toward a goal suppression of knowledge and understanding? Getting rid of morality is important on what grounds? Morals and values go hand in hand. What is the value of ""getting rid of morality""? How would removing a perceived opposition boost your own goals? Is morality really that big of a threat to your mortality as you claim? You want to live in a world of ""rules"" but not ""morals""; you must have loved being in a classroom everyday a child. School is a world of ""rules"" but not necessarily translatable or transferable to one's values and morals; morals and values are something beyond laws and rules; the laws and rules that are followed make sense because more often than not they mirror our values and morals- without values and morals there are no rules to follow- there would be no point. So create your own rules if you will, but remember if there's no bigger value or moral goal in abiding to a rule, there's no point in following it. Morals do not have to be ""religious""; morals are a goal post of signalling what's right and wrong. The more agreement there is on something, the more functional it can be in our world. The value of our own life is important enough to realize that's a morally wrong to kill or be killed and that can be found inside and outside of religion. You can't have a rule without a why. Why not kill people as a rule? Because life has value. Why follow the other 9 commandments then? Well those rules happen to have been pretty solid in value as far as protecting the self and recognizing the self is protected by following this particular set of rules because the value is in their own life, and may or may not extend to seeing a value in others' lives just the same. The reason people won't and don't follow the same rules is because not everyone sees the value in every rule made, and that's okay. We already play by our own rules, and find meaning in the bigger picture when we recognize our personal values are written within some rules and perhaps not others. That's not to say we don't need morals; anybody who has rules they follow it's based on their moral perception of the world. If someone would like to break a rule just because, then they're a rebel without a cause- the value or moral for them may just be that they hate society so much they want to watch it burn... however, finding success within the confines of anti-anything is swimming against the current, because at the end of the rebellion or whatever, one still must find meaning in their belief system, and typically when it's anti-morality or anti-theist or anti-natalism or whatever, it's built and based upon another's belief system that's quite limiting for that group. It's like when vegans claim to be helping the earth by not eating meat- are they also stopping plastic use, or perhaps doubling down on it based on their dietary habits? Nobody has a monopoly on morality as far as truly being able to compare with another their totality of deeds with anther; do we try to keep the score anyways? Sure; it's a phenomenon in history worth mentioning for future understanding. Getting rid of morality would be like trying to rid the world of ghosts: some people may see the endeavor to be worthwhile while others perceive that to be a wild goose chase.

Getting rid of mortality would be cool in favor for immortality to be sure. But first we must truly understand the function of morality and why it seem to be so important rather than just throwing it out with the rest of the garbage compiling in the land fills...

philosophy,fdcyfrv,t1_fdcoi3z,1578288042.0,"Is it truly wisdom if isn't expressed nor shared outside yourself to others that are in the same position were in, until you found a better way? It's a moral dilemma to be in a position of leadership or discovery; would you want to leave those who you care about behind knowing what you know now? What if ""you"" were still in the cave, would you want the person who did happen to leave to come back for you after scouting it out, or would ""you"" be better off in the cave since you may have a strong reaction to a strange story of new knowledge? Wouldn't you at least wonder about that person's whereabouts, and their absence could all the same confirm a strong enough reason not to venture out yourself, all the same... so the question then becomes not about the enlightened person post enlightenment, it is a question of how that person benefits or not from their own discovery enough to feel as though it's important enough to try and find a way to communicate that to the former self as it were; in terms that they would probably accept given what they know from both caves. Keep in mind, there are likely more caves still beyond that; it's how you keep that flame of survival alive is what counts. 

So yes, how do we express enlightenment to others? By going back and unraveling how you yourself came to that state, and being able to recognize that ""your"" enlightenment can be extinguished in a dark cave despite trying to develop an idea and belief about something just as easily as it was ignited. It doesn't render that enlightenment invalid, it's that feeling of stepping from a dark place into the light or with new knowledge and only realizing then how dark or ignorant your former existence was. Without continuing that process of exploring that very experience of enlightenment, we may as all be in our own caves of knowing, that doesn't extend past our own experience. Enlightenment is simply a glimmer of the truth, it's not a monopoly on it, and one simply doesn't continue to stay enlightened unless they are willing to continue to look at the truth in the eye and experience it until it is known; what better way to do that than to go back into the darkness and cross the threshold once more to try and fully understand what that experience is and why it's so difficult to come by unless we try and face the truly unknown? So if one feels a sense of enlightenment, isn't it natural to try and figure out a way to meaningfully express that very experience by replicating it with those that are presently in what was your former situation of darkness?"
philosophy,fdcwixk,t1_fdcenrj,1578286371.0,"It's an allegory because it's difficult for anyone to leave the comforts of their beliefs long enough to realize the validity of something else, and then to successfully reconnect the two experiences is where the value and truth really is. It's not in one or the other, it's in both experiences. As long as one perceives they are in a superior position to the audience and place they started, no true enlightenment has taken place because on one hand, if one leaves the cave in a way that severs one's own roots and experience from ignorant to more enlightened, how is that any different than exchanging one cave for the other? On the other hand, how can you be enlightened if you aren't able to share your cave's warmth with new perspectives that come along? We must remember where we came from, how we arrived to another point, and be able to retrace those steps in meaningful ways, or our own path to enlightenment is lost. The point is that neither is ""correct"" but both experiences are equally valid; connecting the two ideas and variety of experience to form one ideal communication is the key. How can we preserve our belief systems while experiencing new caves? We wouldn't want to seek to destroy values, we would want to ideally communicate the new ideas within the framework of one another's understanding from their viewpoints without invalidating each other's perspectives and experiences. It's not so much cheery as it is ideal, and the ideal is rather difficult to achieve and that's why it seems so elusive. It's about being transparent enough to realize that without walking in darkness first the light would be meaningless; so to bear witness to those that one perceives to be in the dark to offer to then step in to light isn't something that they did, but rather further validates their own experience of the enlightening discovery if others tend to find a value in it too when given the opportunity."
philosophy,fdau2gg,t1_fd9pwws,1578250165.0,"It's actually quite relevant today. Can you think of any instance when you went ""back into the cave""- your family or community of origin after being gone and having a varied perspective on something? Did you think of showing off with speaking jargon or did you express your new ideas in terms that they would be more likely to understand? We've all likely have done both. Think of the real responses and accomplishments with each strategy. Were you ever particular successful with sharing your point of view with another? What was the key in that situation?

The allegory of the cave is to say that just because one can ""wow"" someone into disbelief on an interesting topic one has found to be enlightening, doesn't mean that the communication and transference of ideas was accomplished or expressed in a truly meaningful way. In fact, that's a response that is expected initially, but the goal is to work with both perspectives in order to find a shared meaning in our experiences and perspectives. If we don't work toward a shared meaning, we all might as well be chained to our lonely perspectives, because there simply wouldn't be any advancements being made if we all were truly incapable of leaving our caves or otherwise surpassing the threshold of belief systems held in our social locations and communities. We simply need to remember to be wise enough to retrace our steps in order to build that pathway for those who we may care about having been from a similar place starting out."
philosophy,fdap7we,t1_fdae4fk,1578248596.0,"I disagree. The allegory shows that there is value and wisdom in the cave because they do the best they can and overtime develop a belief system that functions as answers to the questions they have, and most importantly, someone crosses the threshold and leaves the cave. It doesn't suddenly invalidate what those in the cave know and believe, because that person once believed that too, and worked from there all the same. The problem with simply going back in and explaining everything is that now, one must figure out how to express that truth within the confines of their previous belief system in order for those in his social location to believe him. It's not enough to simply assume that they are ""wrong"" and he is ""right"", because they both are; only until a person is able to see the validity and truth of another's experience can they try and apply their own wisdom appropriately to another's situation. It's not about removing your ideals, it's about remembering how we have developed our ideals from simple means and have seen through ourselves the ability to grow and know more than what we started with, and so that simple ideal could in fact be shared with others, if we are smart and fair about how we go about sharing ideas. 

The allegory reminds people to try and see the audience's point of view and to express their ideas in terms that the audience can understand. It's more similar to ""lay-man's terms""; we ask professionals such as law makers, scientists, and doctors to remember to translate their findings in ways that are meaningful to the general public, not just with jargon their ""enlightened"" community is familiar with."
philosophy,fdamyxl,t1_fd9nbiq,1578247862.0,"Yes, on the surface, but then it goes deeper in the sense that because the person has left their community and now knows both truths: what the people within the cave truly believe and know to be true, the place they started at themselves, and also an expanded truth beyond the cave. It is logically only understood by those who left the cave, so the next step for the person who has successfully left the cave to either keep traveling, or perhaps go back and share what he has found to those in his social location, so they can have a similar choice revealed to them and so on. The logical problem with this is that now, they are coming from two different perspectives, and in order to communicate to the people in the cave what's beyond that cave, they must forge a third bridge of truth to make the connection between the two, or the person may as well be in a similar position of bondage. They may be out of the cave, but without expressive communication about one's experience, discoveries that will help one's own social location may go unnoticed and ignored. I think the allegory exists for people to remember those back in the cave, and when we find success, to share it with those who could use it the most; where we have come from to have gotten where we are today. If anybody can translate a piece of wisdom to a community without that particular insight, it's a person that once was of that community themselves. We must remember that the truth, and therefore wisdom surrounding that truth is so expansive that it's translatable to every situation."
philosophy,fdajuzh,t1_fd9ujti,1578246882.0,"The allegory of the cave addresses that the smartest people must then figure out how to enlighten others with what they found to be true by ""going back in"" or otherwise remembering intimately where they started, and how they became smarter, and to then express the wisdom in a language that those who haven't seen what they have but could as they have in a way that they understand; to bring humanity or otherwise the community one has come from up to speed to free them from what captivates them, just as the wise person once was all the same. It's a reminder that one is only as smart as one is able to share that wisdom with others that can make sense for another in the same way they themselves became ""smart"". It's the idea that we are similarly in captivity in our own personal truth if it's something that presently is not expressed in a way that view can be shared."

changemyview,fcsb6s2,t1_fcrfmpz,1577914098.0,"That sounds like the perfect opportunity to have educated her on your point of view. Just because someone is ""on your side"" politically or in a specific instance, doesn't mean your ""job"" is done as far as educating those in your circle on matters that you've explored personally, such as this issue. It's better to have a strong foundation to build the most logically sound school of thought: if there's issues within, those points need to be addressed and discussed first before together going out in an effort to drive people toward your cause, not away.  I'm saying that it's not always ""the other side"" that needs educated. The strongest activist groups aren't necessarily concerned with telling people their point of view, they show it. So if you want people to stop using plastic, then it's better to stop using plastic yourself, and when other mention it, say why, rather then just go around telling everyone you can about the problems with pollution without really doing the work yourself. One can ""educate"" people on their point of view all day and it's still not really ""activism"" per se. If you aren't willing to actually practice your point of view, then it's not activism, either. 

Just like one must activate the yeast for it to make bread, one must work to activate their cause by doing it; otherwise it's never going to become something meaningful. Educating others isn't as important as educating yourself and then acting on what you've learned. Just like people are less likely to convert to religion by a door to door pamphlet and being told to, but more likely to participate in an organization's activities that are of true interest without  also having to swear some kind of allegiance to it; same with activism: you are more often than not going to drive people away if it's just lip service. If you aren't willing to practice what you preach, then it's not activism, it's a debate. One doesn't have to educate others on their point of view to be an activist; the most important thing to do is act. When others ask about it is when one has an opportunity to show why their activism matters and counts and can be beneficial for others to take up as well in their own lives. It doesn't have to be one side or another: the point of activism is to get everyone involved beyond ""sides"" built around a cause not a party, club, organization etc, or it's more campaigning than activism. 

Successful activism is typically more inclusive than exclusive and so it's better to realize that people from all walks of life may share interest in your cause, than to divide people prematurely based difference in point of view only. We all have our perspectives, and it's those difference of perspectives coming together that make a cause so great and to stand the test of time. The more diversity participating, the more activism the cause will likely have and even expand to something we all can enjoy."

To me, my craft is different from those mentioned is that it's almost two different levels of reality that are intertwined to the point of superposition, but are compartmentalized or found within their own realms of manifestation. So for example, I try not to ""show and tell"" my Christian beliefs per se as part of a more naturalistic craft valued in the material secular world, but if some of those flavors or elements are present, I might consider it to be more of a blessing rather than something I did right or wrong spiritually. Spiritually, I would never deny Christ, and materialistically speaking I wouldn't turn down a great opportunity so long that doesn't require the compromising of my personal beliefs, either. They're not at odds, just a varying degree of principles. Similarly, I don't feel required to follow a particular religious doctrine to the t if it seems to compromise my personal beliefs. I'm not required to be labeled as a witch just because some of my interests are parallel to those found in witchcraft; nor am I required to be labeled as a Bible thumper or whatever people slight Christians as nowadays simply because my beliefs are parallel to Christian disciplines. 

I'm just pointing out that sometimes labels aren't a one size fits all meaning and to understand the various perspectives allows us to make our own conclusions as to what ""it"" (anything) is or is not. I simply choose my spiritual practices based on the situation at hand; it's not a question of choosing (and therefore limiting myself to) a particular belief system or label, it's more of a quest to find the broader spiritual meaning in each experience: nothing's off the table, and why should it be?"

psychology,fcnz7cc,t3_ehuk7h,1577821244.0,"It's seems like the group getting ""the short end of the stick"" so to speak is the gay male according to this study. I was actually just thinking about this the other day: I've had my gay male friend make a pass (more often than not crossing what would be a typical boundary of mine) at me ""jokingly"", but I've often wondered why this happens and what would happen if we were to ""fool around""... I've concluded that if a typically gay male is able to experience the (heterosexual) male gaze with a heterosexual woman, then they would be in a position to be more in tune with what the male gaze ""likes"" in copulation with another so that they may take on some of those qualities themselves during copulation with a preferred partner, knowing some additional ""insight"" about bodies and what they like in general. I say this because women (lesbian or not) have more societal preoccupation with looks and this gives them a pass to possess the so called ""male gaze"" and the experience of it without really going out of their way to do so; whereas for the gay male it is hard to gain such a pass into possessing the male gaze toward other males as openly and routinely that females are ""allowed"" to gaze at everyone regardless of their gender without it seeming ""unacceptable"" or ""inappropriate"" to do so, and therefore can enhance their own body satisfaction with more on the table to experience and compare with than not. 

However, the ""male gaze"" is a misnomer because the gay male possesses this ""male gaze"" as well, obviously. But because this gaze when fixed on women can be interpreted as ""competition"" rather than ""partner quality"", then comparing themselves to women would likely result more often than not in body confidence issues, due to difference, even if other gay males aren't interested in females at all, it still is a population that is ""missing"" in the gay males' everyday gaze, in a way that strengthens their own sense of who they are, and instead somehow threatens it."

In the 1850s, people certainly didn't go around identifying as witches, but people were accused of being ""witches"" if they had more open spiritual beliefs and practices than the dominating community. Practicing the occult and ""witch"" are not one and the same. It's generally an insult to be called a witch; whether one practices witchcraft or not; it's akin to calling a Christian a ""Bible thumper""; it carries an offensive stereotype that deems one as ""bad"" or ""backwards"" in society.

So if a person thinks a person looks creepy, it may be an opinion, judgment, or because the way they look reminds them of a creepy person they know. We should be considerate of this person's feeling and not invalidate their opinions based on being triggered ourselves. It's a two-way street of consent and reciprocity. This author should consider being an ally or otherwise for the metoo movement not against it, for they have the same argument as they do regarding wanting to expressing their anger about personal tribulations in a public way, sharing feelings, and wanting consensual sex.

It is a fallacy to go from discussing women expressing the opinion of calling certain activities or men ""creepy"" and the metoo movement ""allowing"" them to express themselves will be at the expense of ""sexually marginalized groups"" like ""queers, perverts, and the BDSM  community, and others who find joy and meaning in the sexually experimental"" are two different ideas here. Since when did calling out what Weinblind did or rather what is creepily described in the article equate to all sexual acts and a ""normative assessment"" of them, particularly for the groups mentioned?

This person is simply not getting any play from what I mostly gather from this article and they're all grump grump about it and looking to place the blame on someone other than themselves, when they don't have to play the blame game at all!!"
