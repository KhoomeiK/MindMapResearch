codevein,fmqjcc0,t3_f4pdrb,1586300739.0,Thanks so much for modding these scythes! This game reminds me A LOT to Vindictus   They wasted that game‚Äôs potential.
BPD,ffp23c2,t1_ff7q3zd,1580084621.0,Same here. Only child kind of. Have been doing this since I was about 7 or 8. Except I almost never talk aloud. I‚Äôm thinking streaming might be a productive way to express this.
BPD,fee55ud,t3_eok534,1579026610.0,I came here to post about exactly this today. I asked my FP if they wanted breakfast (lol) and they viewed the message and didn‚Äôt reply but they liked some other post I put on Facebook just 30 minutes ago. It drives me insane.

Games,fajsgp2,t3_e9bp6l,1576153421.0,I had just bought the collector‚Äôs edition of The Sims 3 and was having a blast slowly melting my laptop. Oh and Dragon Age Origins at the end of the year made for a fantastic year in gaming.
pcmasterrace,f9acah0,t1_f96xg62,1575201017.0,"I don‚Äôt know why this was downvoted. Even if it‚Äôs not the best, many graphic designers prefer Macs. All the art labs I‚Äôve seen in universities have Macs and maybe one windows pc."

BlackPeopleTwitter,f8v570p,t1_f8ubi7h,1574859870.0,That‚Äôs hell! I only served for a year and I still have recurring dreams of getting the drink order of a table of 8 and seeing in my peripheral another table of 8 or more sit in my section and having both tables be mad at me that I was taking too long because it happened every night of working there. I‚Äôm not a good server.
hempflowers,f7kno28,t3_dwdryv,1573819616.0,Just buy their 2019 flower. You won‚Äôt be disappointed and it‚Äôs only like 50 an ounce.  Made my second purchase with them last month and couldn‚Äôt be happier.

hempflowers,f3deqeu,t3_dg6ggr,1570835672.0,"I bought an 1/8 of this and Candyland one day before their 50% off sale, oh well. It‚Äôs so good! Both had distinct smells with Jack having a gassy cheese smell and Candyland having a purple kush sweet smell (and purple buds). I don‚Äôt mind the smaller buds because they were well trimmed and had thin stems. Good stuff, idk why everyone hates on them. Nice glass jars too."

hempflowers,f2u3xlv,t1_f2s9jef,1570406684.0,Yup they had to cut early to be at less than .5% total thc which is still above the limit. I think their bud is beautiful but the system is really working against them and I‚Äôm not willing to pay premium prices for that.

hempflowers,f1kb780,t1_f1ft44u,1569533805.0,Nice. I got some space candy and umpqua in on monday. My umpqua is dark green but man they‚Äôre both fantastic. The pre-rolls aren‚Äôt bad at all btw. Going to cop their mystic lifter when it‚Äôs out next week as a day time strain.

patientgamers,f1b8sxk,t3_d7ryj8,1569327798.0,I just played it a couple days ago too. Reminds me of a dark children‚Äôs book. Her older brother at the cannery really hit me on a personal level.
patientgamers,f1b89xf,t3_d8ek6t,1569327308.0,Californium. Bit of a walking simulator but if you want to explore a stylish 1960s California look no further.
hempflowers,f1a4xjc,t3_d8cyex,1569285290.0,Could I get a pm of the vendor and strain? Sorry that happened but glad they did the right thing immediately.
hempflowers,f18q8my,t1_f18m8gs,1569261751.0,Me too! I hope to try some 1-5% THC when I go to California but for now this will do. All the bud on the market for me is like 15-20 percent way too loud.

UniversityOfHouston,exfswed,t3_cqhko5,1566247657.0,You can try to appeal it with your advisors but the requirements written online are very curt and to the point: 3.0+ GPA on the LAST 60 Attempted transfer hours. You might be wasting your time if you take business classes.
UniversityOfHouston,ex9lxcg,t3_clgtos,1566090839.0,"I know this is old but just wanted to let you know that Digital Media is one of the hardest degrees to find open classes for, even with early access.

Cigarettes,ew371po,t3_baow4o,1565066343.0,That's why I love filter-less cigarettes. Just throw it on the ground and watch it become a little ball of ash in seconds. But for regular cigs I found these aluminum wallets in a Daiso store. They extinguish the cig and contain the smell.
unpopularopinion,esmef5x,t1_esm9jhy,1562103753.0,"I slept for 24 hours too once. I either mixed it with trazodone, which is what I had been given at the ward, or I hadn‚Äôt taken it in a bit and my tolerance was low. I was on a very high dose at night. Scary."

Vindictus - old mmo with 3 high level characters. 

Overwatch - I suck but there‚Äôs enough game modes where I can still have fun and get a couple loot boxes."

findapath,erbvxl4,t3_c14s99,1560695657.0,"I wish I had advice because I‚Äôm nearly in the exact same position. About to turn 25 and have been in college for 6 years with 2 years left to finish a degree, and that‚Äôs if I don‚Äôt need any prerequisites and all the classes are available every semester. I‚Äôve changed my field of study so many times and if I do finish a degree I‚Äôll probably change it again this semester. 

I agree with the poster that said many gamers fall into a trap of studying IT or computer science because they like computers but it‚Äôs not  suited for everyone. I studied CS for 3 years on and off before realizing that I couldn‚Äôt handle all the math needed to finish the degree. 

I think you should seek help for the anxiety first, but if you‚Äôre in the US it‚Äôs so hard to find a way to pay for that."
povertyfinance,eqkgmx3,t3_byo87l,1560122831.0,"I‚Äôve had dental work done in Cuba (my country of birth). Just a couple simple fillings and a tooth extraction. Tipped her and bought her a gift since dental is completely free in Cuba. 

Do some people think that citizens from countries outside the US die when they need medical care? 
Malpractice happens in the US too and for dental it can be even worse as crooked dentists try to get patients for the most bullshit of procedures (countless $2000 crowns)."

AskReddit,eq8jf72,t1_eq4wj7o,1559866604.0,I‚Äôve never met another gamer with this fear! I have it too. For me it‚Äôs not the fear that there might be danger in this area or anything like that. The fear is the wide open void and the way it looks. The worst triggers for it are falling through the map and everything starts bleeding together and it looks like an acid trip. Or reaching the end of the map and you can see the sky box... ughh üò≠
