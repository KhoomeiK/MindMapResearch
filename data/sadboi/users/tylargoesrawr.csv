I can understand we aren't all black-and-white molds and therefore should all act the same. mental illness and how we all handle it is so subjective and should not be pinned down to ""well i have it too therefore this is unacceptable and i don't like her she should know how to act"". like she didn't even have the time to cope with this and now the world is watching their every move. she feels the need to fight because she couldnt before, which i relate to so hard. thank you for your additional support"

i just moved to ohio from Tennessee in September to flee an abusive relationship and met my current boyfriend who was my neighbor. before i moved i found a kitten outside my home, rehomed him after taking him to the vet for all he needed and then took him with me when i moved to ohio (my ex wouldnt take him in, he was a very bad person tbh for many reasons).
my boyfriend adopted the stray outside my work in september and she passed away on us while she was at the vets office over night due to liver failure, it was an absolute heartbreaking moment for both of us because we wanted to finally give her the home she deserved. 
my boyfriend's birthday was literally in just a couple weeks, so i found someone adopting out maine coon kittens and i got one for him. we named him loki. names definitely have power lol. my baby felix is only a couple months older than him. i ended up moving in with my current boyfriend bc things were going so well and hes helping me with therapy. i brought my felix with me ofc. him and loki only needed time apart for a week or two, maybe less! they love each other SO MUCH. like now after a month of living together he is SO happy. they are literally in love. ok story over lol thanks for listening!"

actually i experience panic attacks frequently, and they typically numb my entire right side, my heart beats out of my chest and i cant feel my head. it feels like a seizure or panic attack. it's been like this every since i went to a mental hospital in 2017 and they put me on lamictal, abilify and buspar. later, my doctor put me on klonopin. the same doctor that knew i used my xanax and zoloft to kill myself with when i was 17. 

>Only thing I can ask you is seek treatment for it, at least just to ease your mind. It sounds like ptsd in a way.

i lose my insurance in 1 day. i lost my job 5 days before christmas. the owner of the store would compare my breast size to other customers, ask my about my sex life, porn interests, recent sexual activity and verbally put me down, berate me, yell at me when my first table walked out on me, so i walked out, too. ive been wanting to see a doctor for a while. i stopped taking that klonopin because being a female, i hear it is super hard on the female body comparatively to male, though still not good for men as well. 

dont be sorry. it's always been this way. i dont think its ever going to change. as for my ex, he really went out of his way to hurt me a couple days ago, and i allowed those boundaries to be crossed until i spoke up for myself and watched him grow with hate toward me for calling out his abusive behavior. it seems when they find me at the nearby park someone got shot at trying to find a foreclosed home to squat in until my next destination is when my feelings or me in general starts to matter. i am very tired of finally taking the steps to suicide to only have them squashed by being told they care about me and theyre sorry, and then down the road found doing the same things and never changing their behavior. 

i would literally sell my soul to the devil right now - i would sell my body again if i had to - to have therapy. thats all i need. a steady, non-religious therapist. i wish i could ever afford that. i wish i had a job or insurance. being 26, i am off my moms insurance plan for life now, because america is great. 

i dont have any goals, aspirations, or plans. i wanted to go to school and be a social worker. but i dont drive. i dont have a car. i dont have a job. i have debt. i tried to take off my freelancing career. i am just a failure with that.
