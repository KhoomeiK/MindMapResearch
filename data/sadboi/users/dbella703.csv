VanLife,fpt09ju,t3_gfcica,1588882632.0,"Measure, measure, and measure another 20 times before you make the cut through the roof of your van. Make sure you can get a good seal between the two, and definitely be sure to insulate. The scariest part of the build is ripping into your roof. I personally haven’t installed a camper shell, but I helped a friend cut open the roof and install a few fans in his conversion. Sorry if this isn’t helpful, but I’m sure if you put your mind to it you will find a solution!"
VanLife,fpszvua,t3_gfcoj0,1588882450.0,"I love the VW vanagons, but be wary. The parts are growing scarce for them as well as people with the knowledge or willingness to repair them. Meaning repair services are going to be EXPENSIVE. Depending on your budget, I would maybe look into a DIY conversion? Don’t get me wrong, the vanagons are the “gold standard” of Instagram van lifers, and they really are lovely and wonderful vans. But the majority of us don’t use VW vans due to the economic fallback. Also, the VW vans are not very stealthy. If you’re in a city that doesn’t really condone living in your vehicle you may encounter some problems. There are a lot of factors that go into choosing your van. If you absolutely have your heart set on the vanagon, GO FOR IT! I’m personally shopping for a mini school bus to upgrade."

StretchedClassifieds,fmrbtnt,t1_fmrbno8,1586318818.0,"16-8 are all half sized by default so you won’t see any off numbers. The jump from 8-6 and so on can be tricky so they make half sizes starting then. The best method for stretching in my opinion is the taping method. You wrap thin layers of bondage tape around your plug, gradually increasing the size until you’re ready to size up. Stainless steel should be fine :)"
StretchedClassifieds,fmrbh8j,t1_fmrbdmh,1586318559.0,Start off with good single flare plugs. I prefer stainless steel! Never use acrylic to stretch either because your skin likes to stick to it. Tapers encourage forcing your ear up too fast which can cause blowouts

Some tips for success:
-don’t have any form of weed easily available. The temptation will be too powerful
-it’ll only be natural to have less of an appetite 
-stay hydrated
-and tell smoker friends you’re on a tbreak and to please respect your short term abstinence from smoking"
