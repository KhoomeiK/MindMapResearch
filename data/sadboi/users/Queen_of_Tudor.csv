Once you have slowed your heart rate down, go for a walk or a workout. During that time, make a list of the things you've lost. Then make a list of the things you have. This will give you some perspective.

You are not your job. You are not half of a relationship. You still have value in who you are as a person, not because of anything you have. 

If you need someone to talk to, see if there are are peer support groups on campus (if you're a student) or other grief/depression groups in your neighbourhood. It will help you see you're not the only one."

Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not really any cure for it. You just have to figure out what your triggers are and avoid them. Low blood sugar, flashing light and motion are my most common triggers. The only way that I feel normal again as if I lie in a quiet, completely black room with no stimulus whatsoever and let the feeling pass. It has taken me up to three days to feel normal again during episodes of vertigo.

In my experience, I like the places that have raised canvas beds. Most kennels have cold concrete floors and a raised bed helps keep dogs warmer and it‚Äôs easier on older dogs‚Äô arthritic joints.

Look for a boarding facility that has stringent vaccination guidelines. Some places don‚Äôt have mandatory flea/tick prevention criteria. Avoid those places!!

There was a place in the next town over that killed several dogs when the a/c stopped working on one of the hottest days of the year. Now I always ask what kind of alert systems are in place overnight if the air conditioning or heat were to break down. The place that I board my dog at has an alarm that is triggered if any of the mechanical systems fail (the owners live next door to the kennel facility in a rural area).

Lastly, look for places that allow you to tour the facility at any given time. This generally means they keep their facility clean all the time, vs places that only give tours during certain hours.

And I always read multiple reviews from multiple places before committing to a place. Hope this helps!"
