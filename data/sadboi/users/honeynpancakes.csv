I really love Paula’s Choice SPF 30 mineral moisturizer. It’s a mineral sunscreen so it’s more reliable and long wearing (3% zinc oxide ~4% titanium dioxide), but it doesn’t leave a white cast like most mineral sunscreens. It’s really lightweight and wears great under makeup. 

Unfortunately I don’t know if it’s reef friendly? I would hope so, but tbh I really don’t know.  I’m not familiar with the bleaching process...? It would be good to find out.

The historical context of it has been very misogynistic so we have to be mindful of the implications of emphasizing such a notion. 

I sort of think of it like ‘race IQ’, sure there are differences between the races in terms of IQ (due to socialization, resources, education) but subscribing to that is more harmful than helpful.

But I have seen radfems who do believe you can change sex and be perceived as female/male. I am what you would call a trans inclusive radfem.

I believe trans inclusive radfems and truscums really do have aligning views on sex and gender, such as needing dysphoria to be trans and actually transitioning. Yknow, like actually going from MtF. Otherwise its perpetuating that cross dressers/role players who self-id as trans, are the same as actual natal and trans women.

It also becomes a point of contention where you start legislating on the basis of gender identity instead of sex (trans people included), at which point you’re essentially legalizing voyeurism. Take Canada and bill c-16, which gave us yaniv.
