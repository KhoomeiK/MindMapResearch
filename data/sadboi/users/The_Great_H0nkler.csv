Of course the mainstream narrative doesn't want you to know that, but if you do some digging, you will find the numbers. Women outperform men because the education system caters to them now. It even goes as far as primary education where male behaviour is assumed to be ADHD and teachers send them to be medicated. Women have an advantage in divorce court and custody court. Women are the ones who get paid alimony payments and they usually get 70%, 80% or even 100% custody. In only 3% of divorces do men and women get 50/50 custody. There is a reason there is a growing community of MGTOW out there, and a lot of them are guys who have been torn to pieces in divorce courts. When it comes to court sentencing, women are less likely to be sentenced for the same crimes, and if they are sentenced, they receive shorter sentences. Women attend university more than men to the point where they make up almost two thirds of the university population, despite this, women are usually taking majors for things like oh, I don't know, gender studies, while men usually go into STEM, finance, or law. Women are not outperforming men because they are working harder, the system is catered to women and is quite frankly a hostile environment for men. Don't even get me started on title 9 in the USA, where a man can be expelled based on unproven accusations of sexual assault.

Edit: Oh and despite the fact that women are attending university more than men now, there are still female only grants and scholarships designed to help females exclusively with getting into universities. Someone *proposed* a male scholarship to try and up male attendance, and the idea was shut down immediately.

Edit: Just looked through your posts. The idea that if men want custody, they will just be given custody? What parallel universe are you from? Which country is this happening in? I know guys who have spent tens of thousands on divorce lawyers to *try* and get custody, and of course they didn't get it.

Now, you're right, racism *isn't* the idea that skin colour matters. But I *know*, or at least have a very good idea of what you were going to do with that information if it was available. If the person who wrote the definition of racism was white, you would use that to discredit him, based on his race. ""Because of course a white person would say that"". If a person of another ethnicity wrote it, you'd be a little stumped, wouldn't you? You see, I'm not making a ""leap in logic"", I'm simply showing you the logical conclusion of your ideology. That's why the ethnicity of the person who wrote that matters to you. I'm not saying I ""don't see colour"" as a way to renounce racism. I literally just don't care what colour a person is. What a person does is far more important to me than an innate characteristic. Do you care what size a person's ears are? What colour their eyes are? Then why is it such a stretch to imagine that some people don't care about the colour of skin? Maybe it's hard for you to imagine that some people don't pay attention to ethnicity, because you *constantly* pay attention to it. You're projecting your racist world view onto others. 

You talk about credit limits, jobs, jail sentences etc. How about all the scholarships, affirmative action programmes, etc. that are set up to *benefit* people of other ethnicities? Also, if its racism that ethnic people get longer jail sentences, less job opportunities, etc. would you be willing to admit that systematic oppression of men exists in society too? Men get sentenced more often, and for longer sentences than women do for the same crimes. Women have an advantage in court *in general*. Women have plenty of scholarships supporting them through higher education, despite the fact they're doing much better than men are in higher education. So, admit that society systematically oppresses men. Or does your ideology not allow that?

Sure, some racism is through systematic means, but racism is also on the level of *individuals*. If a person of one race is bigoted to a person of another race, that's racism. Plain and simple. Do you call it racism if a black person is racist to an asian? Why? Every advantage that white people enjoy in society, is enjoyed *even more* by Asians. If you look at earning demographics, jail sentencing, who is most likely to do well in school, Asians come out *on top*.

Anyway, like I said. I do see colour, I just don't care. You very clearly do care about colour, and are projecting your racism onto white people, because it's a convenient way for you to get it out there, but also for you to virtue signal about what a good little idealogue you are. I wish *you* good luck in unshackling your mind of these racist views, and seeing people based on their hearts and not their skins.

However a lot of the science says that the difference in neurological structure and endocrine levels between the sexes is a strong predictor of behaviour. For example women having more white matter and men having more grey matter. Men having higher testosterone levels. Women having higher oxytocin and estrogen. The female hippocampus being larger. 

Female brains (typically) are more wired to the traits I outlined in my previous comment, and male brains are (typically) more wired towards the traits I outlined in my comment. If you think about human history and how we evolved, this would make a lot of sense, no? Women would stay within the community, gather supplies and communicate with one another. Women would need to remember where the best fruits were, which were poison, etc. And they'd need to be able to communicate that. What did men do? Hunt, fight and protect. You don't need many communication skills to do those things. Sure, there is communication using body language and eye movements, but no complex verbal language.

I live in a society where it is encouraged that men and boys share our emotions and our feelings. We just can't/don't though. We aren't wired that way. Often times I have noticed something, particularly about women, but sometimes men too. You will encourage us to express emotion, and if we do express emotion in our way, it's either inappropriate and we need to stop doing it, or it's inconvenient and we need to stop doing it. 

I'm a man and I do cry. I usually cry in private, because crying is a vulnerable thing. You literally cannot see properly. 

I don't know if I am an atypical case because of my emotional problems or the fact that I was abused by my peers growing up, or just my mental disorders, but even the way a typical man expresses themselves and the way I express myself is very different. Almost 90% of my emotion is expressed via irony or dark humour. I have an automatic repression mechanism that I cannot control due to trauma that was inflicted upon me. The only time I cry or express anger is when emotions cause me physical pain. Anger feels like someone is boiling water in my lungs. Sadness feels like someone clamped my throat in a vice. These are very rare experiences for me. 

I have been going to therapy for about 3 and a half years now, and even the way therapy works seems more female focused. An anxiety group I was a part of worked well for all the girls there, but did nothing for me and a couple of other guys there. The one size fits all model of our mental health care system doesn't work. Our education system was terrible with helping me against my peers too. They tried to sweep me under the rug and told me I didn't know how to interact properly with other people (this after I had been abused for months, pushed in front of a moving vehicle, and almost stabbed). There was nothing done about the guy who brought an illegal weapon to our school, he faced no consequences. However that same school, when a brown girl (I don't know her actual ethnicity) reported race based verbal abuse, immediately started handing out detentions and had an assembly on the importance of stopping racism. Where was the assembly about how you shouldn't bring knives into school, I wonder? Were my problems not important enough for the school to deal with, or were they too severe, and so needed to be hidden? Maybe it's because I'm a white guy, and it wouldn't look good for the school to virtue signal about that, as opposed to virtue signalling for a brown girl? Who knows. All I know is there are a lot of guys like me out there, and all of us are alone in the dark.

Edit: I actually did overcome my social anxiety in the end, but this is not thanks to the group. What helped me was I started lifting weights, learning how to fight/protect myself, and just generally better myself physically. I'm trying an alternative approach towards my depression by exploring stoicism, but I have yet to see if that'll help. Just picked up Marcus Aurelius' ""Meditations"" yesterday."
MensRights,fh83s58,t1_fh839hp,1581351391.0,You couldn't have written yours sooner?! My thumbs are tired ðŸ˜‚
MensRights,fh7vuib,t3_f1r2ce,1581346059.0,"Ok, I'm not sure I speak for the whole MRM, but here are my views on the matter. Women have had a huge emancipation in the last century, where they no longer have to fulfill a traditional role, and enjoy certain rights without having to deal with certain responsibilities. Am example of this would be giving women the vote without making it mandatory for them to register for the draft. Now, you might object: ""But some women want to be in the military!"" (I'm not saying you would, but I've seen that posed as a counter argument). Women get the *choice* to be in the military and to sign up for the draft, but men don't get the same choice.

There are also undeniable privileges afforded to women in custody court, divorce court, court sentencing, the way our schools function when it comes to scholarships, grants, even down to the way we teach students. Men are becoming more and more likely to fail school, and men are becoming more and more withdrawn from our society. 

Men are more likely to deal with addiction, to be homeless, to be killed on the job, to be the victim of public sphere violence, to commit suicide and if you take prison into account, we are more likely to be raped too. 

Men are still expected to fulfill a traditional role. Men have not had the kind of emancipation that women have. Men are expected to be corporate slaves, to go to work, toil away at a 9-5 and for what? Family values are being eroded. Often times a man either has no family to support, or if he does, he either doesn't work hard enough and is too lazy, because apparently he needs to cook, clean AND work a 9-5. OR the man spends too much time working to support his family, and so the wife cheats or divorces or is resentful, and points the finger at him. Men have no incentive to fill this role, but society pushes them into it. Sadly its pushing women into this role too. We are in late stage capitalism, so family values do not matter, what matters to the beurocrats is a surplus of cheap labour. Why do you think we're pushing women into the workforce as much as possible now? Women have reportedly been getting progressively more unhappy, and I don't doubt it has something to do with our corporate society. 

Feminism operates on the ""apex"" fallacy, which is the assumption that because the highest rung of society is dominated by a certain group of people, all people belonging to that group must share the same privilege. Feminism, I have noticed, has been about categorising people into groups, ignoring individual choices/actions. You're white? You must be privileged! You're a man? You must be privileged!

I'm interested in either returning to a time when gender roles were more enforced, and the division of labour more clear. Man brings home bacon, woman tends to home, they make babies. Either this or a true emancipation of men, and not the feminist kind of emancipation where its all ""Oh you need to express your emotions more"". We aren't good at that. Our brains are wired differently to women's. Women's brains are wired (on average) more towards communication, emotion, memory and multitasking. Men's brains are wired more towards focusing on singular tasks. We're just wired different. We can't rant for hours about how becky spilled our coffee and it was all just too much and then have a cry. Sure, we men cry, and we express emotion, but we do it differently. The kind of emancipation I am talking of in regards to men, is to afford us the same privileges afforded to women. Give us *choices*. Don't make the draft mandatory for us. Give us the choice to stay home for 3 months when our wife gives birth. Don't try to force us into the role of corporate drone. Give us a choice. Oh and don't call us evil simply because of our genitals either. My dick is not a weapon, and I will never use it to assault someone.

Edit: fucking hell I wrote too much. Tldr: give men the choice and privilege that has been afforded to women."

Why do transgender people get special treatment in this regard?

Edit: And why is a POLICE OFFICER getting so upset over words which could be an honest mistake? Surely he/she has bigger problems like the threat of being injured on the job? I'd rather protect myself than rely on someone as sensitive as this to protect me."

relationship_advice,fft86aq,t1_fft4tdj,1580211800.0,"I never said I believed the outbreak started on the 31st? I know China is lying to us about this disease. They're lying to us about mortality rates, the extent of the spread of this disease, etc and all we know is that there is *no vaccine*, a 14 day incubation period, it can be transferred by someone who doesn't show symptoms, and the mortality rate is *ambiguous at best*. Why would China be so hush hush about a disease that wasn't so bad? Your case doesn't rest, we haven't had enough time to even see the extent of the damage this disease can do. OP is right to remain cautious, and clearly she is acting based on her knowledge of this field.

Edit: And do you know how many people just *forget* to get vaccinated against influenza? Even I forgot to get the jab a couple of times. People don't panic about influenza because we know why it kills people. It typically kills immune compromised people, the elderly, the young, and people with other health conditions. We panic about Coronavirus because we don't know who it kills yet, it could kill *anyone* for all we know. I know China claims they have been curing people, but its hard to trust them when they've been telling so many lies about the outbreak so far."

I'm not sure if it works the same for strains, so I'd recommend resting them and if they're better in a couple of days then yay. If they're not better then it might not be a normal muscle strain. Is there any pain with normal walking, sitting, climbing the stairs, etc?"
Fitness,fft1u4g,t1_fft1qch,1580202533.0,Yes you should definitely rest the strained muscle! ðŸ˜‚ Some people say you shouldn't train a muscle group if you're still experiencing DOMS in that area. Allow the muscle to rest and recover before working it again or you'll likely worsen the strain and do some damage.
Fitness,fft1k5z,t3_ev31w1,1580202120.0,"It's likely you just strained the muscles a little, unless you weren't using proper form. Can I suggest putting bench press between squats and deadlift so that the different parts of your legs have a chance to rest between exercises? I do this on push days where I have bench press and shoulder press to do, but I also have squats. I start with bench, then do squats, then shoulder press. This gives my front deltoids a chance to rest and recover while I'm squatting. Just a suggestion ðŸ˜‹"
