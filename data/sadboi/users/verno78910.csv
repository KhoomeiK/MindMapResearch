ClassroomOfTheElite,fp8xu9y,t1_fp8n8jf,1588406815.0,"adding onto this ^ I wouldn’t say you are disqualified but you would have no clue what we are actually referring to as the anime only adapts the first three volumes and volume 4, 4.5, 7,7.5, 11, 11.5 are the ones which most of us refer to when talking about Kei and Ayanokōji’s relationship"
ClassroomOfTheElite,fp8gw5j,t1_fp8bf2m,1588391985.0,mhm I don’t agree that it was badass watching him bully Kei. It was satisfying watching her break and still be reliant on Ayanokōji. He put her in a position that most would stray away from but handled it by actually backing her up when it was needed. I respect his methods but I also respect Kei for having the will power to withstand everything and continue to place her faith in Ayanokōji.
ClassroomOfTheElite,fp8gncz,t3_gbx1et,1588391807.0,I actually liked the method he used personally to break Kei and rebuild her. Damaged people can’t always be skated around and I think the way he handled it is one of many possible ways to do it. I think it was effective and I have no problems with it

ClassroomOfTheElite,fo4rh6m,t1_fo4gl4o,1587509797.0,I’ll post what I wrote on another post similar to this. I think everyone is overcomplicating the relationship between Ayanokōji and Tsubasa. I believe that Tsubasa was simply intrigued by the fact that there was a special order to take him out as an individual. Think about it from her perspective. Why would the school care so much about expelling one person and why does it have to be kept a secret? She would only be able to come up with small theories which is probably why she went at him with the words “You’re evil” etc. She was trying to gauge his reaction to get more of an impression.

EscapefromTarkov,fi51zb7,t1_fi3p6cl,1582153167.0,They already replied
EscapefromTarkov,fhz29lh,t1_fhz21b6,1581989208.0,I know and I think it’s kinda stupid. Interchange having a more challenging exit is an attraction to players that want said challenges. I don’t think anything should be changed about it as I play Tarkov for a hardcore experience and if you aren’t playing for those reasons than you could always go Powerplant (if you are PMC) or play the other maps. Interchange is completely fine in the eyes of most long time Tarkov players
EscapefromTarkov,fhz1zx5,t1_fhz1n2h,1581989032.0,"Yes i’m not saying I disagree but that adds to the challenge that interchange presents which is arguably a good thing for those that want a harder experience (namely a lot of tarkov players want this). It being different from the other maps is no exception to what I mentioned above. If you are looking for an easy map then you won’t pick interchange, if you are looking for more of a challenge than interchange can present that."
EscapefromTarkov,fhz0why,t1_fhz0sem,1581988320.0,It’s not that hard to stop though is what i’m saying. Like you have to be extra careful sure but having a harder map doesn’t mean that the game should cater towards the players that can’t adapt to being thorough with checking for those camping
EscapefromTarkov,fhz0i20,t1_fhy0m9b,1581988059.0,I play interchange almost exclusively and I have to say that camping is a part of the game. If people don’t like it just don’t go to railway extract lmao
