Anxiety,fqle23z,t1_fqki8c7,1589455363.0,"This is a positive outcome because firstly you're aware of thoughts which are causing negative feelings such as disassociation. I had heavy feelings of depersonalisation (disassociation) last year and nothing felt real. I was in my own world and everything felt so external from my reality. 

I seemed to find calm by being thankful of my mind for protecting me when experiencing depersonalisation. Then after, telling it that I am okay and I no longer need the protection. Essentially you're in a state of freeze (the third of the flight or fight response). It's kinda like paralysis where you don't know what to do next. 

When you see these anxious thoughts in your practice, just observe them for a little longer. Try not to get caught up in them, just allow them to come in, watch them like a movie for a very short moment and then move your focus back to the breath. Sometimes I find when I meditate I 'let the thoughts go' by pushing them away a little. Since I tried being more observant of these thoughts and not even trying to push them away in the slightest it got much easier to accept different feelings. Be mindful of if you are pushing them away even if it's a very small amount. Let them come in open the gates to all of them.

One last thing. If you feel that you're on a pursuit of happiness, remember that looking for it will mean you are not in the present moment. I found that for a long time I felt lost and on this pursuit. I changed my focus in a longing to learn more and focus on solving problems in my life right now. This way I became way more content and grateful for what I have now. Just remember everything you need is right there with you right now. Hope helps abit üòÅüëç"
Anxiety,fprdv6e,t3_gexfg1,1588851381.0,"I have had something similar to this, I used to feel guilty for allowing myself to do leisurely activities when I felt I could be doing something more important. Constantly feeling a need to work every waking hour or I wouldn't be making progress. This led to lots of stress and anxiety because I never felt I was succeeding.

BUT, I got into meditation over the last few months. I noticed a pattern in my thinking whereby good thoughts and feelings seemed less real than bad thoughts. Interestingly, the more I observed this pattern, the more I realised that I felt negative thoughts more in my physical senses than I did positive thoughts.

I concluded that the reason was, I became so unaccustomed to positive thoughts because I could never really feel them physically. Where negative, it was in my chest, sweaty hands etc. So I think a good way to really work out how to address different thinking patterns is to just listen to how the thoughts make your body feel. 

Not specifically thinking about them, but just having 10 minutes just to observe them and see how your body feels. Eventually, you may begin to see that positive thoughts are actually just feelings just as negative are. 

Knowing that it's okay to feel any feeling or emotion is totally normal. Sometimes we get annoyed because we feel a certain way, but it's okay to feel that way. It's okay to feel anything. When I struggle with thoughts, I remind myself that it's okay to have them and that they do not control me. I have this mantra when I'm meditating and it gets abit hard and in my head I say 'I am here for you'. Allow your thoughts to come and go, be there for yourself and your mind. It will thank you for it in the long run. Hope this helped in one way or another üòäüôè"

I have this problem alot. But I know its because I set extremely high expectations for myself. I'm getting better tho, and that's because I allow myself to fuck up. 

Little background, I'm a music tech student. I produce music. I used to go in trying to make music as good as they top artists. 

So I thought about this. if I COULD make music THAT GOOD, I sure as fuck would NOT be sat here in my room producing. I would be at the top, some sick studio or whatever (obviously I'm exaggerating but ya get my point).

So I learnt to say 'right, today I'm gonna have a fuck it session' basically this is where I ALLOW myself to fuck up. I expect nothing but mistakes.

Tell you what, the best music I've ever made came from a fuck it session. I think that is enough said.

Also in reply to thermal, I eat omelette daily and I still fuck it up. But 95% of the time its on point üôå

Anxiety,foan5cd,t1_fn7rill,1587649495.0,"Thanks for the reply mate, sorry I've been a while getting back. Keeping the socials to a minimum atm.

Definately agree with better dealing with situations. I'll make sure to keep up the practice then if routine is the main focus for sustainability. I've been moving up in session time steadily. Somedays are much harder than others which puts some doubt in your mind. Surprisingly difficult to just sit still for 30min to an hour! But I am aware that this pain during the sessions is the way to see the greatest result if you sit with it
Look after yourself. Cheers!"

edmproduction,eqkr9ie,t3_byqalu,1560129413.0,"My advice would be to buy a ticket to an event and try to meet other producers there. If that means going alone then so be it, if you love this enough you can put yourself out of your comfort zone to seek fellow producers. It's definately a challenge for some, but you will be rewarded in return if you find a good mentor.

Maybe even try to meet people online who produce who are also going to a local event and go together. I have met many producers from going out and most give solid advice.



Note: Only take advice from people who have done what you are trying to do. They don't have to be superstar DJs but at least have enough knowledge that can lead you down the right path. 

For example, if someone says they're a producer and they're tracks aren't finished but they have loads of small bits they probably aren't the best option. Doesn't mean they can't help you in some ways, but being sure you're not being sold rubbish is important cause alot of people in this industry are all talk.

Hope this helps you out man üòä"
EDM,eqkq8ck,t1_eqjxg6s,1560128786.0,Exactly mate!
EDM,eqjwskr,t3_byj40c,1560112567.0,"I thought the production quality was great. It wasn't overwhelming by any means but that's expected. It's pretty stripped back but they even said they wanted to try and keep it as close to what was originally made. There's only so much you can do with what they had. Definately all the tracks are radio-ready. 

The big Avicii fans will love it and that's the main thing here. Us producers always analyse things on a new level and that's a good thing as we are not the consumers. 

Good opinion to cast tho mate, love a good debate on this kinda thing."
