Agreed! The worst is when they make you show your video. But sometimes that creates more anxiety, just knowing that people will see you. Then what if you just had a panic attack... You still have to show your face anyway! ðŸ˜«"

Pizza sounds good. Is it her favorite food? Maybe bring some of her favorite foods and deserts?

relationship_advice,fimpofg,t3_f8pfvn,1582541724.0,"My mom always told me, ""if you want a friend, be a friend"". Which is a simple way of saying, to make a friend you act like you would want a friend to act towards you. You do all the things that you would like to have in that particular relationship. One way to build a friendship is to spend time together. For example, most likely you would want to be invited to hangout, so invite this person to hangout with you. Text him/her every so often. Ask questions: learn about his/her daily life, school, work, etc., take a genuine interest in his/her hobbies, be there when he/she is struggling or having a tough day (offer kind words, a listening ear, and/or a gentle hug).

Making friends or maintaining relationships is all about giving. This could be giving time, attention, gifts, affection and/or support. When you give to someone you feel closer to them and they feel closer to you, because you care about them. Then, they will naturally reciprocate and when you need something and are having a bad day they will be there for you. Normally, they will start to ask you to hang out or want to spend time with you. They will be the one texting you, because you initiated with them.

Of course this applies to a healthy and balanced relationship. But sometimes certain people are not as good at initiating and building a friendship, it can always be something they/you can work on. Sometimes, you may have to initiate a bit more than they do in the beginning but not in a overbearing way (but if it's a one-sided situation in which you are doing everything and they are doing nothing, then it may be better to stop initiating)."
relationship_advice,fimow85,t3_f8pde4,1582540614.0,"One thing to do would be to figure out why she feels like you are pushing things. Then try to work on those aspects of your relationship together, if you can.

However, if she feels like the relationship isn't going anywhere  and you do break up, then she wasn't the right one for you anyway. Yesterday I watched an amazing video about this topic: https://youtu.be/C5WxLrDnkFg I highly recommend that you watch it.

Even though this may be hard to hear now, it will save a lot of heartache in the long run.

As an ESFJ, my college degree will help me help people and that is on big strength of the ESFJ! Also, I talk to my friends or people in the STEM classes that I am taking. I tell them about my struggles and ask if we can study together (if they are in the same class) or we can sit together and do work side by side (if they aren't familiar with calculus).
