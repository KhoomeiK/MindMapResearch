truechildfree,fp2de69,t3_gaw4ry,1588259811.0,"This is a great idea! It is disgusting how many people get rid of their pets just because they have a kid.

I 100% think you should do this! I am just going to add a few thoughts. I volunteer a lot in animal rescue in my city and have learned that it is HARD to advocate for animals, but it is SO important that people like you exist and are out there to help.

I would probably go to more grassroots rescues opposed to the SPCA. In my experiences, the SPCA and the Humane Society have not been helpful (they have ignored horrible animal abuse cases in my area and are not easy to deal with because of all the red tape). Grassroots rescues deal with a lot more and understand the struggles to a greater extent since they have a lot less resources. They are also volunteers so they are rescuing because they want to help, not for a paycheque.

Pets are seen as property whereas children aren't, so any sort of CPS equivalent would be tough. There is a group of volunteers in my city that I am part of, we had rabbits who were burned, paralyzed from being stepped on (paralyzed ones had their organs shutting down because they couldnt get to food/water), and countless other problems such as bad wounds, infection, etc. and the humane society told us that they didn't need an investigation because ""they saw food and water in the home"". In addition to that, the food was just lettuce and carrots which are supposed to be very minimal in a rabbits diet. Unfortunately, the law does not really care about animals. We even had the bylaw office tell us to feed the rabbits to the coyotes in the area to ""solve the problem"". It can be heartbreaking, so just prepare yourself for these types of responses and remember that it's all ignorant and careless minds. You will make the world a better place if you press on <3"

personalfinance,fai08di,t1_fahzvh2,1576097161.0,"It doesn't really cost him more. Usually even or he may have a bit of his per diem left over.

The budget that I've created (that I use myself, just trying to tailor it for him now) has categories for each month. So if his projecting amount for ""dining out"" is $150 per month, this would be easy to follow if he isn't traveling. However, he will spend that easily when he goes on a trip. So when he inputs it into his budget spreadsheet, it will look like he is always over budget.

I'm wondering if it would be best to take a specific amount in cash for each trip and whatever is used in cash, does not go toward the budget spreadsheet?"
