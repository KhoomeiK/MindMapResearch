Routine 

This morning I washed with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo, conditioned with Tresemme Botaniques (from the beginner routine). Distributed with denman brush. Rinsed our most of it, left enough in that my hair still felt smooth and clumped together nicely. Applied LA Looks with praying hands then scrunched with head upside down.

Out of the shower, I scrunched with an old T-shirt to get rid of some excess moisture, plopped with a microfiber towel for 15-20 minutes. Air dried and then scrunched out the crunch

My absolute favourite (so far) has been What I Did For A Duke. I just loved the characters so much and how they grew to appreciate and understand each other. It takes place over the week (maybe two) of a garden party, where the hero tries to seduce the heroine to get back at her brother. She catches on and calls him out on it pretty early on and then they go on to actually become friends before anything else.

circlebroke2,fio0f33,t1_finqdmf,1582573853.0,"I 100% understand the frustration with women’s experiences being dismissed and the rampant misogyny on reddit as a whole. I don’t think that this is the best example of that though.

Regarding who benefits and why they’re happening so frequently, all I can do is offer some personal anecdata. I’m a lady that’s been raped twice, and sexually assaulted and harassed too many times to count. Depending on the day sometimes it seems like I’m at different stages of processing each event. I’ll be fine for months or even years, but then something will trigger me and I’ll need to tell my stories or read other stories again as a coping mechanism. Some for validation, some to help validate others, and some to actually help process and heal. It really varies, but engaging with new stories and new perspectives help me feel like I’m not alone and help me understand that it’s ok to be angry about what happened to me, or sad, or to sometimes not be much bothered about it at all. It’s not a straight line to healing - I didn’t go from victim to survivor to activist or whatever, I’ve bounced around a lot from total fucking wreck to mostly over it and it is really important for me to see that it’s ok to still be triggered sometimes and it doesn’t necessarily mean all of my progress is wiped out and I’m fooling myself for thinking that I’m recovered. I wouldn’t have been able to see that if I hadn’t had so many opportunities to have these conversations when I needed them. 

There are periods on my life where I would have wanted these conversations every week. It’s also not too difficult to imagine that the increasing awareness of male rape means more exposure to the idea which means more people are wanting to /feel safe to start the conversation."
circlebroke2,fin6tj9,t3_f8nqb8,1582557141.0,"I don’t know man. It sits badly with me that we criticize men (and rightly so!) for co-opting conversations about rape in feminist spaces, and then go on to call them out for creating their own conversations to center their own experiences. I think these threads are probably more healthy than not for the victims and can help spread awareness of the problem. It’s not a complete discussion of all facets of the rape crisis, but not every discussion needs to be all things to all people.

ETA - reddit skews male, so it’s not surprise that there are more threads about men than women"
