BipolarReddit,fplbk6t,t3_ge2pw7,1588709781.0,"All my life I have been told that I can go so far. That I have great potential, that I am smart.   
Well, that was until I got the diagnosis, and several years later I realized I was literally hypomanic all thru school.   
I have been to the deepest part of my mind, and the darkest. I have been so fucking depressed that I had to have ECT. I have felt like a nobody, that girl with the potential that crashed and burned. Severly mentally ill all of my 20s. I have been through hell.  


But....our value is not what we do for a living. It is the kind of person we are. Kind, funny, emotional, intelligent, creative. We have seen sides of ourselves that many people never will see in themselves. We have empathy, we get it.   
And we should use that.   


I tend to look inside myself and selfdestruct everything thats me. And I need to stop doing that. I am a good person. I love animals, I am an empath. I am good at writing, and I am studying history.

Main thing to do is to SQUEEL and walk away when puppy bites you. High pitch sound, and suprise him. Do not pay attention to him until he is calm. Then you reward with treats and/or voice commands. 
If he presists just walk away. Even leave the room if needed.
