It‚Äôs a morbid fact of life, but everyone above the age of 18 should have one so their final wishes can be followed. Who knows about op‚Äôs relationship with their sibling?

We‚Äôve been limiting necessities like eggs and milk. Some lady tried to get 3 gallons of milk (WTF?)

Who needs 3 gallons of milk? Who needs 4 packs of eggs? Who needs 163859263 different packages of meat?

I walked around the house for days crying knowing there was nothing that could save her. They should probably seek out therapy or bereavement groups.
