BPD,fk2xldv,t3_fg62jq,1583811648.0,"I don't know if my perspective is welcome but perhaps what happened is that they set it up last night while you were not there and are currently too busy to check in on you. On the other hand, if they are intentionally ignoring you, then they're not worth your time."
BPD,fk2xehc,t3_fg6tsi,1583811510.0,"I believe there's subconscious comfort in being attracted to someone who is not available. There's a familiarity to it, something that someone readily open and emotionally present cannot offer. Someone ""good for you"" might come off as too different.

Plus almost everyone wants what they cannot have."
BPD,fk2x75t,t1_fk1bpc9,1583811361.0,"I empathize completely. In your shoes, I'd try to find more reliable friendships and then branch into managing FP.

Fuck FP though, even if they're perfect in every way imaginable."
BPD,fk2x4j1,t1_fk09i79,1583811307.0,"It's natural to blame oneself in hindsight. I must say though, if you are worried about making her life worse, then what if you were to hurt yourself?"
BPD,fk2wz15,t3_fg6gwg,1583811196.0,Sure. I blame it on childhood loss of a parent. It helps when a FP is active on social media. But then I realize they've not responded to me sooooo...
BPD,fk06e6a,t1_fk063k6,1583744020.0,"That is a serious problem and it sounds like you do not have great support systems. I would consider myself an adult and would say that you have it worse, actually. What I hope you take from that is that I find life to go on the uptake later on with a stupid amount of effort and support.

I've never had a pregnancy scare in my life. However, I would look for support in local shelters and such if turning to any family is completely out of the question."
BPD,fk0665h,t3_ffrmo3,1583743710.0,Oh wow. My only thought is that this therapist did not maintain proper boundaries. That is not your fault at all.
BPD,fk05t9d,t1_fk05osv,1583743211.0,"If you don't mind answering, how old are you? How is it going to get worse? I ask these questions because I want to understand and I can only make assumptions. Could you tell me more about this thing? What if you chose not to care about that, if that is possible?"
BPD,fk05d20,t3_ffrebd,1583742590.0,"You've made it so far, right? Is this harder than it has been before? If it is, then that's really rough and I'm sorry to hear that it is."
BPD,fk05b20,t1_fk04uzd,1583742513.0,"I wish I could tell you that the cycle stops but I struggle with that myself. At the same time, I know for myself that I do genuinely love. Someone falls out of FP for me and I care for them later on still. I've learned to care for them even after that cycle of despair. Now if only they'd stay but, well, they haven't yet."
BPD,fk04dr0,t3_ffpbn0,1583741236.0,"Hey, you know you're attractive. That's powerful knowledge. I admit that children is a bit of an urgh for me and, at the same time, others will not mind at all."

BPD,fk03ans,t3_ffq3td,1583739789.0,"I liked what a client of mine went to called SMART meetings. In it, they had a tool called ""play the tape."" Imagine really going through it and looking at the consequences. Another one is allowing yourself to drink afterwards. Set that up, see how it goes, and maybe it'll subside by then.

What I've done myself is force myself to go sober just for a month or two. I prove to myself that I can keep it under control when I need to. That's a whole different story though."
BPD,fk032zt,t3_ffq8ga,1583739512.0,I kind of get the same way. I get very frustrated that I don't know how to say such and such and find what I'm actually being taught to be stupid. Then I get overwhelmed and give up.
BPD,fk0315m,t3_ffqffp,1583739446.0,"I can't tell you what you should do but I can offer my perspective. I would trust him for his word that he loves it all regardless and, at the same time, not want to let them continue. I'd try to find out exactly what he is willing to handle and do and what he expects you to handle and do. If you can figure out how to help yourself in the moment, that would be wonderful. I know what I need is verbal affirmations, no matter how basic, along with a hug. I personally find them and myself to be super annoying and I recognize that that's what I need from a person to feel good. So if I were you, I would tell him that or whatever it is that you need in the moment."
BPD,fk02v2p,t3_ffqq0h,1583739221.0,"It's a natural feeling to want to be loved as well as giving out love. I can't say why you crave it so much and feel so much pain but I can think of potential reasons. It may be a lack of it due to the past, it may be due to a lack of self-love."
BPD,fjzzpb2,t3_ffopl6,1583735309.0,"Yeah it sucks. It's this sickening flashback that's both from actual loss and every other time something has happened.

I do wish people would just say something. I personally try not to get involved with people anymore without expressing that boundary at the beginning too.

But hey, I recently messed up and didn't do that for myself. There's that nagging feeling that there was ""something I did."" But maybe we didn't do anything and it's all in their head. We'll never know, and not knowing is hard..."
BPD,fjzzhsn,t3_ffjc12,1583735069.0,"I often feel the same way and, as we can see, many others do too. I don't want to overstep by saying this and at the same time I hope it helps: going to DBT has made me feel LESS stunted and immature. I really do believe in its efficacy.

Now if I only I could get over the crippling through that I'm a burden and the thought that nobody wants to hear what I have to say."
BPD,fjwu5a1,t3_fegxgc,1583645934.0,"Pre sure people feel this way but I've been agonizing over the fact that I feel like I'm going to hurt someone with my manipulative asshole ways. I feel like I need to warn them but then that'd just push them away, right?"
BPD,fan89ef,t3_e9wy0q,1576228550.0,"I have. It was a bit of a hassle to find work afterwards but it's never been too long for me to go without a job once I start looking again. Funny how it's actually hard for me to find a new job since I've been looking around while currently employed.

But heck, sometimes I actually like my current job, so maybe that's why I haven't tried so hard."
BPD,fan844r,t3_e9xzto,1576228344.0,"Sometimes I find it wild that I work at a mental health place dedicated to DBT. I get to teach it to clients and keep the skills fresh in my mind. I like to think I don't show any meltdowns while I'm here but tbh I've been emotional on the clock.

I struggled to get here though. I got sick during another job and got super stressed out because my bosses at the time kept trying to get updates. It was so bad that I cut out everyone from my life and didn't get out of bed unless it was to eat snacks from the cabinet or go to the bathroom. In hindsight, it was ridiculous, because I was worried about being worthless to my employer. Bah.

That was my first full-time job. I've had plenty of part-time ones, have graduated college somehow, and the aforementioned job is my second one ever. I think I do a good job and, well, having walked the path they've been on in some respects helps me relate."
BPD,fan7uti,t3_e9ucjw,1576227983.0,"I end up defining love as wanting the best for them, whether or not that includes me, whether or not they love me back. It's letting them be free and supporting whatever they choose. It includes sacrifice, communication, cooperation if they choose to stay."
BPD,f9j9m30,t3_e5c4kq,1575362614.0,"I try to feel grateful for the time that I had with my FP. That regardless what happens next, I got to see her and feel her warmth, her everything. I don't need to explain to someone else what a FP means to me...

More good moments will come, with FP or not."
BPD,f9j9j0h,t3_e58shq,1575362482.0,"Today I had a pretty poor day. Felt sad for most of it, heck, probably my worst in a long while. But I remind myself (still) that I had a great day yesterday and tomorrow might be great too. And if not that day, then, well, I find it unlikely there'll never be another good day.

My point is, things do lighten up, even if I've been feeling like utter crap. DBT really is magical, even if I find it frustrating at times too."
BPD,f9j8x24,t3_e56jcs,1575361580.0,"I sometimes feel like I'm gaslighting myself. ""Only a crazy person would believe that that's not okay. You should be okay with everything people do because it's no big deal."""
BPD,f917n7w,t1_f8ybh6s,1574983806.0,"I actually like hooking up. It doesn't allow me time to attach. It's prolonged dating that doesn't go anywhere that drives me mental.

I do think, though, that the internet has spoiled us for choice and has ruined our ability to sacrifice and commit. Maybe it's not so bad to ""settle"" as long as it's not too much."
BPD,f917hwd,t1_f8ybxgy,1574983729.0,"Oh I believe it is very much a thing to subconsciously pursue people whom are emotionally unavailable. It's almost like a comfort thing, at least due to my upbringing, and genuine openness confuses me or even outright scares me.

I think that's true that I've learned that I can't stay completely casual with someone more than a month. At the very least, at least now I know. And I had some good dates along the way too, right?

Gosh but I hope she's just busy and not disliking me."
BPD,f917acf,t1_f8yxl6d,1574983624.0,"Ouch. I expect you apply the ""don't deserve you"" to your ex-wife too. I took a short break too, and I'm definitely better than I used to be. I just wish I could take it easy like seemingly all of my friends do."
BPD,f9175t6,t1_f8ztw24,1574983561.0,"On the good days, I try to look at it as inspiration. Why would she want to be with someone who isn't striving for more? And eventually, I hope it can all be solely for myself.

That's the thing though, isn't it? It's nice to know we're not alone but then we know others are in such pain too."
BPD,f8xttd3,t1_f8xt9b6,1574934027.0,There are millions of reasons why but I just feel so unimportant to someone whom I'd sacrifice a lot for. Maybe I'm too giving of a person.
BPD,f8xswek,t1_f8xsj84,1574932584.0,"I never liked to settle. I've always wanted to be the ""go-getter,"" the gal who climbs a mountain with bare hands, that sort of crap.

When I am feeling happy though, I admit I do feel like that. I do feel grateful for when my current FP is around. I just feel so, so dejected right now because I didn't get to see her last weekend and she didn't respond to me today."
BPD,f8xrwxl,t1_f8xrpp3,1574931107.0,"What makes someone a long term choice? Why am I so unpicky compared to others, it seems? I just want to be with somebody whose company I enjoy. Loyalty, of course, but I imagine loyalty comes with wanting to stay long-term for other people."

BPD,f8xl5rd,t3_e2sb11,1574922522.0,"Reach out to others. This will challenge the idea that you are alone.

Be responsible for yourself. Everything is a process and human beings are capable of accomplishing great things, but only with great effort.

Love yourself. How can one love another if one does not start at the base? You are the only person you have for certain.

Find beauty in fleeting moments. Nothing must be a certain way, so appreciate what you have now."
BPD,f8xkahk,t1_f8w4n6e,1574921640.0,"That's the heart of it, isn't it? Feeling disconnected and alone while surrounded by others.

BPD,f0g2iri,t1_f0g0hrb,1568592688.0,"I just wish I didn't feel so afraid. I love exercise because it's like the one factor in my life where I feel like I have total control. I can put down the weight, I can finish the set, I can run that extra minute even when I'm feeling super tired.

But people... nothing guarantees them staying."
BPD,f0g04l9,t1_f0fzokn,1568591613.0,That's probably true. I have some good friends who haven't. I just get scared because one of my ex's told me that I was emotionally dumping on her and that it was really hard on her.

BPD,euy3rww,t1_euvrujf,1564095191.0,"I agree with you on the premise of it being an ineffective method of categorizing people. However, in order to get the INFP result, people would have to answer similarly."
BPD,euuf9qy,t3_chi479,1564043102.0,"Maybe that's why she left me. She told me that I deserve someone that will put in as much effort as I do because she was afraid that she'd only disappoint me.

If only she knew. I wish I could just be by her side still, regardless of the nagging doubts. At least that pain isn't the same as the sadness of loss."

I hope she knows I meant it when I said I'd be willing to give it another shot if she ever felt like she could. I won't hold out for that, she knows that too.

Gosh, I miss her so much already."
BPD,euf4ysk,t3_cfy198,1563762709.0,"When this happens, I try to remind myself that there is a cause for all of these behaviors and beliefs.
