SuicideWatch,fdlwbg0,t3_eieayu,1578534054.0,I struggle everyday with living. I just can't find a reason to want to live life is so bland. I have trouble with being happy because I'm always focused on the negative. I feel as thought my whole life I have been living with quiet desperation  I fantasize about slitting my wrist and jumping off a bridge I frequently see the world a blaze especially in the winter time. I can seem to get a accurate diagnoses I begin to become a hypochondriac. I also know if I said the truth I will would be incarcerated probably never freed I honestly don't know what to do just a simple thought involves me having three perspectives dominating for control. No I'm not scitzo I believe but truely I don't know
