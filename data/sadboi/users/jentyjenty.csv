sharpei,foy6bmt,t3_ga0krr,1588166310.0,"All I know is that I was driving on the highway and a sharpei ran out in front of me. I pulled over to help her and she jumped right in my car! We bonded almost instantly. I say, go meet the dog, see what her temperament is like, and go from there. Maybe you click with her or maybe she’s got personality traits you aren’t looking for. I recently got a puppy from a great breeder and she’s the light of my life! Be patient with rescues, though because she could just need time to adjust. I don’t think you have to worry about her remaining bonded to her old family. Technically that’s a possibility with any foster dog. Once she’s settled with you, finds a routine, and learns some obedience from you, i’m sure y’all will be fine! Plus she’s SO young. It takes a few years to form a super strong, solid bond."

But some nights I just sit on my couch staring blankly at the wall for hours. But just because you don’t have a common interest doesn’t mean there is something wrong or people don’t enjoy being around you. Go easy on yourself, being cooped up is hard on all of us and you’ll get back to your familiar routine soon. Your husband can’t understand because he doesn’t have Bipolar, but I hope he is supportive. Perhaps find an activity for you to do together like play a board game, pick a movie, cook a meal, etc. Date Box is a subscription service that’s great too!"
