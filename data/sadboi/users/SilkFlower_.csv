depression,f6p4702,t3_ds57wd,1573046904.0,"I was thinking about this a while ago. 
A few years back I read an article about how mirroring people's gestures and ways of speech makes them unconsciously like you. I, friendless and depressed, started to put that to practice. I was trying so hard to make people like me that now I do that unintentionally. That makes me have one personality for each person I talk to and, when I‚Äôm alone, I act like I dont exist - shrunken, always walking fast, quiet - and I dont even know who I am anymore."
