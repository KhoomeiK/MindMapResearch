I was bullied badly for 10 years (on and off) and it was so so damaging, especially because I had other abuse and neglect going on at the same time. I was told it would “build character” and that I needed a “thicker skin”, when in fact it just broke me. I went to boarding school for 6+ years of it, so it was inescapable and I constantly felt under threat (teachers got in on it too). I hate how much people minimise bullying and don’t see it as legitimate trauma - how could they expect a child to come out of *any* sort of repeated victimisation unharmed? As far as I’m concerned it’s just child-on-child abuse dressed up as a “rite of passage”."

The last time I heard from them was last Thursday. I have absolutely no idea what to do as the interview is at 8:45 am so it’s not like they’re going to have time to let people know if they do cancel. I can’t afford to completely blow off what could be my last job opportunity for a long time, but also can’t afford to get fined and I don’t want to put anyone at risk.  I personally see it as essential to go as I need an income and don’t feel like I have a choice (plus even though it’s a non-medical role it is within a “key worker” industry), but I’m now terrified of being stopped by the police and fined/arrested.

BPD,fl9ajc9,t3_fkvejt,1584947104.0,"I’m struggling with how to behave and how “safe” to be at the moment. I don’t know how to strike a balance between social responsibility and self-care without feeling horrible about myself. 

I’m practicing social distancing but still need to go out sometimes for food, medication, the vet for our rats, to take the bins out etc. Plus I have a job interview tomorrow that for some reason they’ve decided not to cancel, which baffles me. I can’t afford to turn down a job atm so I have to go. People in my area are not taking things seriously either, so even if I’m trying desperately to stay 6 feet away from them they don’t seem to get it and still come really close. 

I’ve also been going out for (socially distanced) walks, both alone and with my husband, because we don’t have much private outdoor space at home - just a tiny square of courtyard with a table immediately outside our door. I tried staying home completely for a few days but the lack of fresh air and sunlight made me feel incredibly depressed, bordering on suicidal. I’m worried that I’m doing the wrong thing by going out for exercise even though I’m keeping my distance from other people, but I’m also concerned that if I stop, or if our government cracks down and stops allowing people to do that, I’m going to deteriorate quickly and end up in a really dangerous place mentally. Would they be able to stop me even sitting outside my front door at a table to read and get some fresh air? Would I be able to take the bins out? These kind of questions are running through my mind constantly. 

All I’m seeing on social media at the moment is people saying how selfish it is to not stay home. Logically I know they’re not referring to people who have to go out for essentials or work (my husband is a postman so CAN’T stay home). I know the majority of their anger is aimed at people still congregating in groups or crowded places. But it still makes me feel incredibly shamed and like I’m being told off. I feel like a selfish piece of shit for doing things that keep me sane even though I’m being super cautious. As a result I now feel guilty and paranoid every time I step outside my front door. 

I have no idea whether these feelings are rational and I really am an awful person or whether I’m being too hard on myself - I’m technically following government guidelines, after all, and I’m genuinely doing the best I can in my personal circumstances. I’m going to talk about this with my therapist in a few days but I needed to get it out somewhere and see if anyone feels the same, because I feel crazy."
BPD,fl5e39n,t1_fl59gjl,1584834575.0,Me too. If my husband raises his voice at me even slightly I freak out and start crying and beg him not to be angry at me. It’s a real issue.

BPD,fl5d34d,t1_fkv9e61,1584833918.0,My group has been cancelled too. I’m having short individual sessions via phone with the therapist who runs it but it’s not really the same.

Luckily my detailed results showing this were on my patient portal, so I booked another appointment and insisted they look into it further and get me an ultrasound."
PCOS,fk23ov3,t1_fjso89o,1583792479.0,This definitely made sense! I’m pretty femme in my presentation too which I think is where a lot of the discomfort I talked about in my post comes from.
PCOS,fjrp3ic,t1_fjrj69y,1583588441.0,"Thank you for this, especially the last paragraph - even though I logically know it’s true, it’s really validating and reassuring to hear other people say this stuff."
PCOS,fjrovql,t1_fjr8vx7,1583588348.0,"Thank you, this was really validating."
PCOS,fjrotya,t1_fjr6vwi,1583588326.0,Thank you. I think I’m psychologically punishing myself too much for this so a bit more self-care might be in order!
PCOS,fjropy0,t1_fjro02k,1583588283.0,Thank you. I was feeling very alone when I made this post and this has really helped. ❤️
PCOS,fjr6mlu,t1_fjr2zg3,1583582085.0,"Thank you. I’m voluntarily childfree so wouldn’t want to get pregnant, but even so, fertility is so tied up with femininity in society that I can’t help but feel defective for having a wonky reproductive system. I haven’t had a period in 6 months and I feel out of touch with other women."
BPD,fjn0wtb,t1_fjmz2hx,1583493626.0,"Thank you for this. We have plenty of food and general household stuff so should be ok with that. Medication is my main concern but not a lot I can do about that one as I’m not able to stockpile it. I keep having mini panics when I wake up with a stuffy nose and a headache but I think it’s allergy/food related. I just hope our government are sensible enough to deal with things appropriately, but I don’t trust them as far as I can throw them sadly."
BPD,fjmw1lm,t3_fe8cjl,1583486808.0,My care coordinator asked me how at-risk I felt the other day and I was like “um how long is a piece of string?” because I can go from 0-100 and then back very quickly.
PCOS,fjfy401,t3_fd19sj,1583303887.0,"I decided years ago that I have no interest in having kids (biological or otherwise) and luckily my husband feels exactly the same so he had a vasectomy a few years ago. The idea of being pregnant or having a kid fills me with panic. 

As someone waiting for a PCOS diagnosis (it seems incredibly likely but not confirmed yet) I am a bit worried that I’m less likely to get good, thorough treatment because of the fact that I don’t ever want to get pregnant. It sucks to feel like drs might think my treatment is less important than someone who wants children, because wanting my body to work properly is still completely valid whether or not it’s for fertility purposes. I really hope I’m still taken seriously."
