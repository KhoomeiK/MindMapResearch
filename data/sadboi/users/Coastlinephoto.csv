migraine,fr1rj2z,t1_fr1g5zi,1589824720.0,And do you have these symptoms because of your chronic migraine with aura? Or have you been diagnosed with HM as well?

HealthAnxiety,fqralbb,t3_gkiejb,1589580683.0,have been concerned with how excessively sleepy this whole week myself. There has been no reason that I could imagine why either.

AskDocs,fqr37ui,t3_gkhdut,1589576750.0,"All of these things have happened to me on and off sporadically at different times or all together.

I don’t have much advice on MS but I doubt that you have it. I think stating that you had clear blood test results just recently could reassure you. I don’t say this lightly since I need 10+ things reassure myself even after clear bloodwork 

but I’d say just grab some lotion or coconut oil or something similar to first alleviate the itchiness and just relax to a funny movie or tv show while doing that if you have a chance to for the time being, and don’t check with Dr. google or webmd for awhile."

HealthAnxiety,fqezbp7,t1_fqewd2e,1589316101.0,"I definitely thought about this. I stopped eating beef and pork last year which gave me a small bout of anemia. I eat my greens.. I should eat more but started an iron supplement. I go on and off it depending how heavy my shark week was (that’s what I call that girl time). I started taking the iron tablets again 3 days ago immediately when I felt this way. Hopefully it’s something in regards to that and it still needs time to kick in. It’s just weird because I’ve been eating a lot of broccoli and spinach lately as well.

Oh.. and I’m not paler than Normal to answer your question."

I also had confirmed swab for the regular flu (influenza a) on March 3 and was Resting and recovering that week. I have the typical fever chills and sweats, body fatigue, cough but no sore throat. I got over all of that I just can’t kick the cough away and I’m trying to reassure myself that coughing so much might have irritated my throat to start a sore throat."

migraine,fj4fte3,t3_f7ku3f,1583007266.0,"Ugh yes! The auras heighten my senses - blurry off-like vision that makes me feel dizzy, overstimulation on touch and sound. 

Throws me into an anxiety sometimes panic attack and I can’t tell which started first."
HealthAnxiety,fi1fx7f,t3_elgs5k,1582056962.0,"I got diagnosed officially 2 years ago with ‘migraine with aura’. It started 2 years prior feeling similar with numbness feelings, photophobia (light sensitivity), dizziness and vertigo,crazy head pain that felt like an attack and not just an all day lingering headache.. it felt like the ‘googled symptoms’ of cluster headache which reading about is scary. 


Prior to the diagnosis of migraine with aura, another neurologist diagnosed me with occipital neuralgia. My current doctor told me that that was a wrong diagnosis. So on top of having these migraines, having no answers… And wishy-washy answers with no MRI results , it gave me anxiety and fed into panic disorder for on and off months (also my first time ever having anxiety so this also freaking me out). I learned that migraines have different symptoms with different people and it’s not just the typical throbbing head pain. I even got strange burning face pain that I thought could’ve been trigeminal neuralgia, also scary.


It doesn’t hurt to get a second opinion, but I would join a Facebook or Reddit group of ‘migraines’ just to see all the symptoms that people get are definitely paranoid feeding. That’s the reason why I’m on here, my anxiety comes and goes and it’s been around lately for no reason. A lot of the time I feel like it’s a combination of migraine snowballing into anxiety and so on. At least that’s what I’ve been telling myself lately 😅"
panicdisorder,fhzhkh2,t1_fhz2ko1,1581999729.0,I agree even though I post such things as this. Sometimes explaining and looking for someone to reassure me helps tremendously. So thank you.
AskDocs,fhvlcky,t1_fhvl1ii,1581898612.0,I’m not sure… It just seemed like quite the jump and I only know a little about each test which is why I asked - not in any medical profession. I think I read somewhere when looking up normal numbers that the 100 MVC is high for ‘normal limits’
Hematology,fhvgsg0,t3_eiwcyc,1581897194.0,"In the last year my 

Lymphocytes have dropped from 24 to 17.9%

MVC went from 97-100fl

Monocytes and Absolute Monocytes have dropped a few numbers 

Absolute Neutrophils went from 4.64 to 6.28

Neutrophils % went from 63.1 to 73.3

Preliminary Abs. Neut went from 4.64 to 6.28


This seems to be a jump in just less than a year and I wasn’t sick or fighting a cold during the bloodwork but had a cold a month prior. Should I be concerned? It also has the history of 2017 with numbers similar to Those of early 2019 listed here."

pianoteachers,fg4q195,t3_es5deu,1580508563.0,"I teach part time private lessons through my own business, and part time at a music school. 

This music school has had consistency of flaky students and parents white-lying that they are sick just so they don’t lose the money within the 24hrs. Cancelled policy time. So they came up with having video lessons - that way they are still getting a lesson… But in video form so they can’t complain that they are paying for a lesson whether they attend or not.

There are upsides and downsides to these video lessons, as a teacher… I prefer being in person with a student, other teachers can say different, especially if the student missing the lesson is .. let’s say.. a brat and a headache to teach :)"
