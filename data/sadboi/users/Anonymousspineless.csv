My mother was pretty well off as a kid, her parents had multiple businesses throughout her life so they worked really hard for it and she got a lot from them including a car and the down payments on her first house, she worked for them and this meant as soon as she finished school she declined college offers, this caused her parents to be very controlling of her.

when she met my father (who they didn‚Äôt like) they were cold and refused to attend her wedding, after that they stopped talking and my mother moved away to this day we haven‚Äôt spoken to them,

My mother and father were poor as he was a labourer and she had no degree, my parents separated and my mother went back to college finished her degree and is now an English teacher, she still struggles as she has 7 children and is on teachers pay but we get by.

That‚Äôs her story"

I highly doubt any doctor would put a 12 year old on anti depressants 


Do best thing for you to do is either;

Just keep an eye on him make sure he isn‚Äôt getting to dark or detached from thing 

Tell an adult, adults can contact his parents to get him help or get him in school therapy, so there‚Äôs no harm

Sit down with him and make him feel comfortable and ask him why he‚Äôs doing it and what‚Äôs going on with him

Ignore it and let him get on with it ( I recommend this as a last resort) 


Really he is going through his own shit no matter what‚Äôs going on and if he has a ‚Äúhistory of depression‚Äù I‚Äôm sure his parents are aware of the problem and taking care of it.

People who hate themselves so much that they cut themselves and want to kill there self that much is definitely depressed,  do you think that non depressed people just want to die?? Only non depressed people who want to die are people about to face a life sentence, which I assume you are not 


And if I know one thing it‚Äôs that trying Prozac definitely cannot hurt it will not make you feel worse as it‚Äôs designed to make you feel happier so it‚Äôs a good thing that you should try


Also you are young probably too young to diagnose definitively so he just wants to make sure your feeling better

like seriously you said you self harmed and think suicide is the best way out of that‚Äôs not a depressed person sentence I don‚Äôt know what is.

Look he isn‚Äôt a miracle worker you say you have highs and lows now he isn‚Äôt as concerned about the highs as much as he is about your lows and there is no such thing as neutralisers that bring both moods to a stable place and he can‚Äôt put you on uppers and downers

so he is trying you on uppers because being to happy isn‚Äôt as bad as being depressed and wanting to kill yourself and if that doesn‚Äôt work he will put you on downers to try and down your mood in that sense

I understand your frustrated about this experience but you may have walked in with unrealistic expectations so his abilities

Also a psychiatrist isn‚Äôt a councillor or a therapist he was there to diagnose you, not fix your problems he did what he was paid to do. Maybe you need a therapist to rant to every week and feel better, what he did was assessed you and decided to attempt to help to get a better idea of what your going through, like a doctor taking blood sample to see what‚Äôs wrong with you or putting you on antibiotics to help your infection.

I‚Äôd suggest you try the Prozac and see what happens and how you feel and if it‚Äôs not working wean yourself off it gradually"

Extreme emotions/ reactions ( something that shouldn‚Äôt be a huge thing is made into a huge thing)

Up and down mood

Tell her to talk to the school and find out what kind of support they would offer then check out New York‚Äôs state benefits and childcare grants ( some states have this but I‚Äôm unsure if ny has this) basically call the government office of New York and ask what they are entitled to.

Advice,fh9ng8y,t3_f1zqep,1581385339.0,"You are 17 you can make doctor appointments and keep your parents out of your records from you are 16 so just don‚Äôt tell them and get birth control pills, a coil or bar in your arm in ( all of which you can get without parental consent provided your over 16 in most states) 

problem is if you are in the US you would have to pay for these as it‚Äôs usually not included in health insurance and even if it was your parents would be notified.


if your in the UK from what I gather this is under the national health service for free (pretty awesome), so your parents don‚Äôt need to know under this service.

Other ways to prevent pregnancy in any forms are;

Condoms,
Morning after pill,
Abortions, 

And if you do get pregnant and do not want the child there is always adoption. 

If you do unfortunately get raped when you go to the hospital to get checked out they give you morning after pills along with pills to kill infection so even if that very unlikely situation unfolded as long as you do the responsible thing and go to a hospital you never need to be pregnant.

All forms of birth control wether it be pill form or procedure are completely safe and cause no problems later in life, they are also completely reversible in case you change your mind as you become an adult 

Hope this helped, stay safe."
