ErgoDoxEZ,fr6nfy4,t1_fr5k3y7,1589929506.0,"How small are your hands? I'm asking because if I rotate let's say the left half of the Ergodox 30 degrees from a front to back line and [keep my index finger](https://i.imgur.com/hw6tcmt.jpg) on the F key, my hand is covering the half quite efficiently, including the thumb cluster. For the rest of the keys that seem out of reach a slight hand movement upwards and it's ok. (excuse the angle and hand position, it's actually much more relaxed but had to curl over to take the photo).

You have tenting and incredible variation to positioning your halves, can you not find a comfortable position? Genuine question, I'm not bashing you or anybody complaining about the layout, after all it is a hobby driven mainly by preference.

I am asking this because I've heard a lot of complaining and all hail the grail Dactyl but hovering above an Ergodox half isn't really so bad compared to traditional keyboards and tbh for me personally a Dactyl feels way too cramped with everything so close by.

Hope you find a solution.

ergodox,fqp1zea,t3_gjzd6p,1589532159.0,"When I first got into the hobby and wanted a split ergo I just went for the Ergodox EZ.

My reasons were:

\- I need a keyboard that works out of the box because if I break something when building it'll be bad; also very hard to troubleshoot although it wouldn't be the first time I tinker with electronics;

\- at this point in time I built and rebuilt but started with 40% and 60% and I remember how much trouble I had with the Ortho48 kit (my fault breaking stuff); a split is a bit harder to build due to how the halves work;

\- hot swap so I can build my switch knowledge;

\- overall the price difference from a full custom build and the Ergodox EZ was too small to dwell on it; be mindful that you pay import tax on each bits so factor that in as well.

&#x200B;

Over time I became more knowledgeable about what I personally like and became more skilled with a soldering iron and the build process so I could build whatever I like. But luckily I don't need to build another split because the Ergodox EZ still works and is great as it is.

&#x200B;

So depending on what you want - keyboard that works? Learning to build? - have a look at your skills and see what needs improving and go from there considering the following:

\- if it's your first build you will make mistakes; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/eqb47c/ortho48_a_love_story/) is my story with the Ortho48;

\- a keyboard without a case doesn't really sound great imho, so if you want to learn about how switches sound a closed case is better than plate + pcb + backplate sandwich and hot swap is a really good thing to have when you start with the hobby;

\- [lubing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSgPKPoFo2k) switches [matters](https://vimeo.com/343919023); [filming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndT_TTQLflI) them also matters;

\- you need good tools to build with - this includes good solder besides a decent soldering station (or just a plain TS100), flux, solder pump - and develop the skills to use them;

\- the skills to use those tools - you shouldn't develop them by soldering on a PCB because PCBs get ruined really easily and from there it's a pain to fix them (but not impossible)."

As an example I just adjusted my chair and my position and the WPM has gone down due to the change in posture. Wiggled around the position of the halves and it's back up. Considering you need to train muscle memory for 76 keys out of which each 38 can be moved around the desk - it may take time for you to find an ideal position.

But on the other hand, you can do it, unlike with a classic keyboard that you move all 104 keys at the same time and you have to adjust to it - the Ergodox can adjust to you at the same time you're adjusting to it. And this is why we got it in the first place. Plus layers and what not :)"

They are right. Bear with me for just a minute, I know it's a long post. And it will be controversial. Feel free to downvote, but only do so after you're done reading. Ready?

&#x200B;

How does one define ""a good life""? For most people out there it means having a roof over their head, food for their children, a car/van/truck and maybe some monies for enchiladas on a family outing on a weekend.

&#x200B;

Personally I define a good life as essential + optionals + a sense of fulfillment and serenity and sometimes joy and happiness. Essentials are things without which life is kind of impossible on this earth in 2020AD - e.g.: food, shelter/roof over your head, a job, maybe a means of transportation to and from the job. Yes, a means of transportation is essential in may countries, get over it countries with ridiculously good public transportation.

Then there are the optionals that are hobbies with all that they entail, savings for your child's schools and stuff like that.

&#x200B;

The sense of fulfillment and serenity, joy, happiness - these can be impossible to achieve if you have unresolved mental health issues. I feel this needs to be conveyed to the people who slap us in the face with ""you have a roof over your head"". Well, yes, Karen, I have a roof over my head under which I can kill myself because I can't derive any happiness from anything?

&#x200B;

Please remember though that [people are people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkCwFkOZoOY). You need to gauge very carefully how they would react to an honest and sincere explanation and also if they are worth the effort. In time, I realised and acknowledged that most people coming and going in our lives are not worth that effort. That is a decision that you yourself needs to make.

&#x200B;

However, they are essentially right. You can't have mental health issues if you have a good life. Remember, even a broken clock is right twice a day.

What are **you** going to do about it? Be upset with them or seek help and get better?

ergodox,fq62fwq,t3_gh2s7d,1589123096.0,"Tl;dr: no

&#x200B;

Long version:

First of all just spray painting it may ruin the looks if done improperly. Remember it's a plastic case. You'll need to remove everything and sand it thoroughly, then apply primer and that's just the beginning and can last several days - few coats with 24+h in between.

Also worth noting the Ergodox EZ has an integrated plate that if painted will chip in the best case scenario or mess up with the switches you insert in there - yeah this can be masked though.

The coat of actual paint also requires careful application so you don't get areas where the paint is thicker and areas where the paint is thinner.

After a few coats of actual paint you'll need a finish up coat that will be a transparent matte coat. And over here it depends on what you buy and how you apply it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you really want to do this, use of an airbrush and acrylics as well as a very hard finish coat may be a better alternative. But I think it is a lot easier to just get another 3D Printed case comissioned in the colour you prefer rather than spray painting a 400$ keyboard."

The top tip with this board is don't let anybody tell you what to do. Of course, **take advice** but ultimately it's your board, it's fully programmable and you can make it yours as you see fit. I have a similar layout across all my keyboards (Ergodox EZ, [Planck](https://imgur.com/a/BIOjRr5), [Ortho48](https://imgur.com/a/V1THWOx), [Fjell R4](https://imgur.com/a/fMv7Umn)) and I can work with any of them without more than a minute accomodation time, and this is what's important to me.

Materials needed to craft a full custom are:

\- keyboard case (groupbuy or r/mechmarket); good offers on MM are rare, just go with a nice GB and make sure you understand the issues that can plague a GB as well as the fact that there is always a chance those monies are never coming back;

\- PCB - **should** come with case, make sure you buy an extra just in case);

\- keycaps (same as above);

\- switches of your preference; don't buy the exact number of switches, but slightly above it (10% extra for example);

\- stabilizers - depending on the keyboard case build, screw-in (PCB mount) or clip-in (plate mount);

Optional but recommended as long as you build a mech:

\- switch opener compatible with your desired switches (bear in mind Halo switches have different clips than Cherry MX/Gaterons);

\- switch lube - 205G0 or 205G00 for linears, Tribosys 3203 or 3204 for tactiles;

\- [switch films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndT_TTQLflI) \- this is heavily depending on the switches, some really benefit from it like Cherry MX or Gateron Yellow, others not so much (films don't do much for Holy Pandas or Nolives in my experience).

Obligatory but not always mentioned:

\- decent soldering iron (I use a TS-100);

\- decent solder (I use Kester 245 No-Clean Core Solder 63/37 .031 but any solder with that composition should be fine);

\- flux pen just in case you need to desolder;

\- solder pump just in case you need to desolder;

\- well ventilated room and an extractor fan for actual soldering;

\- a lot of patience and a general budged you'll need to stick to because it's very easy to get attracted to different things around and drop too much on a keyset off mmarket.

You can have a look [here](https://mechgroupbuys.com/) and see the current group buys for keyboards and keycaps if any are interesting to you. Then use a local vendor or EU vendor to get switches, stabilizers, switch lubricant, switch films. You can try kbdfans as well as apparently they are shipping to the UK again. Lube +/- film your switches. Then it's just a waiting game."
ErgoDoxEZ,foylb5i,t1_foyjyjq,1588174566.0,"It is factual, fantastic results from Google. I could have never done that myself.

What I am taking a stand against is the elitism displayed on this sub that is literally annoying. You can't even explain something without sounding like you're up high on the ergonomics gods' mountain dispensing knowledge to the rest of the peasants.

It's also ""factual"" that the most correct position to type in is by floating your wrists over the keyboard. I find that exhausting and completely counter productive to my work flow.

FIY, if your chair is low enough and you have a certain position then you can have a fantastically comfortable position with the Ergodox tilted _towards_ you. I prefer a 7 degree typing angle myself. This is preference. It doesn't make you suddenly more comfortable to type on a negative tilt and if it truly does (hint: it doesn't _for me personally_) then most of those ""morons"" using keyboards all day are doing it all wrong because I've yet to see a negatively tilted keyboard in any office I've ever been to.

It's preference, not the ultimate truth. Deal with it and stop the holier than thou attitude, it's really irritating."

I am slowly but surely getting rid of my ISO boards because I don't use them anymore. At the moment just using the above Fjell and Ergodox and at work I take my Ortho48 or Planck.

I think staggered rows to ortho is a much more difficult transition than ISO <-> ANSI but that may be just me. At the end of the day it's all preference. From an aesthetic point of view I prefer ANSI but that's just me, whatever you like personally is just fine! :)"

Eve,fopmllt,t1_fopm5nd,1587965607.0,"On my first prints my experience was that the models are best cured after bathing them in alcohol (literally put them in a jar with alcohol in, cap it and tumble it around a few minutes, let to sit for a few minutes, repeat, then extract, rinse, drain, cure in UV thingie).

Submerging some models needs more alcohol. I like to be a frugal person when I don't have an isopropyl factory in my portfolio (this stuff ain't cheap especially when actually good), and the alcohol itself seems to keep a lot of its properties intact when it comes to soaking/rinsing prints. So instead of just rinsing them using the alcohol as water I just use a vast assortment of jars and trays and when I'm done I filter the remaining alcohol back into the big bottle. Leaves me with another 5 bottles to spare for the future (and hopefully not to manufacture bootlegging hand sanitizer welp)."

Prints need to be washed in 99.9% isopropyl and cured under UV light - I recommend getting an actual UV nail lamp, works p. great instead of hunting for the sun.

Think of layer switching as something you do in a fluid way, like using shift + letters for capital letters rather than switching the layer at a push of a combot then proceeding to using said layer. In time it will prove faster to press MO(1) with 1 to get F1 rather than doing what you are suggesting.

However, what you are suggesting is indeed possible - check out the other respons from /u/jlba64!

&#x200B;

Long keypress for one thing than tap for another is done differently than layer switching.

&#x200B;

E.g.: you have a second layer for your top row that is the number row instead of QWERTY. You have a modifier key for that layer and whilst that key is pressed you have numbers instead of QWERTY.

&#x200B;

Now ask yourself: do you really want to map QWERTY so that long presses give you numbers? Because typing a phone number would become hugely cumbersome.
