depression,etnkg0l,t1_etmm23m,1562990069.0,Thank you very much. I'm so happy for you and impressed by your decision to seek help. If you live to 100 you potentially have 40+ decades with lots of happiness and productivity in them. And who knows what is beyond. Thanks again.
depression,etmj80e,t1_etm8klu,1562961159.0,Would you mind describing how you feel different post-medication?
depression,etmj5fz,t1_etme3wu,1562961113.0,"I'm still resisting medication in my thirties, which is probably silly.

I just want to try exhausting all other options first."
depression,etmiyk1,t1_etlrbr1,1562960988.0,"I am very similar. I hope I don't out myself with too much personal detail but I'll be fuzzy on my age. I was at Oxford and then I spent many years in investment banking. This should demonstrate that I was somewhat hard-working and ambitious. But I was just following the path that was expected for me. If I'm told to do something, I can do it well.

It's when I'm left to my own devices that I struggle.

I left my job about a year ago, with lots of savings, because I was fed up of it. I'm trying to work out what to do next. And I have no idea how to handle the freedom of being an adult.

I was raised in a similar way to you. My parents were very loving and were trying their best, and they are in large part responsible for my success via academic hothousing, but they did do everything for me. I don't think I ever developed a real sense of personal discipline. I never did a chore in my life before I left for university, for example!

It would shock my friends and peers if they knew how much I still struggle with the basics of living, even in my thirties. I have never managed to pull together a basic budgeting, exercise or diet routine. I cannot bring myself to focus on literally any hobby. Only my best friend and partner can see how frighteningly infantile I am in these areas. 

It's bizarre - because I was capable of feats of great complexity and endurance at work, and then on the weekends I'd fall apart - with less maturity than your average seven-year-old.

I think the most important task of the parent is to make your child feel loved and secure, which my parents did very well. But the second most important task is to make them sufficiently independent. They tried but I think I was so weak I needed even more of a push!"

depression,etlgvii,t3_cc4ffh,1562936032.0,It's an imbalance in your brain. Your external achievements won't eliminate that totally. Can you talk with your doctor about improving the amount of dopamine and oxytocin you produce? Do you have a romantic partner?
depression,etlff9g,t3_cc4fvy,1562934760.0,I feel this very regularly.
