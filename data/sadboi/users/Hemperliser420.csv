I had some trouble sleeping the first night but was probably due to the soreness but other than that i didn't crave anything, i just had to keep myself occupied. I can probably smoke now if i want to but I'm just going to take this opportunity and take a tolerance break because i was spending abit too much money aswell.

I personally think the concept of withdrawals from weed is over hyped, there's nothing to be worried about friend, if i could do it you can too."
