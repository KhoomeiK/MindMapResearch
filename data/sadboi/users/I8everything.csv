I’m not sure what advice to give here aside aside from seeking help however that’s very hard if you find doctors and psychs untrustworthy. 

If you feel you have BPD, please look into DBT or some form of therapy to start so you can begin to stop hurting others/gain some self love and respect by becoming a person you’re comfortable being.

Also am extremely confused about what is what. 

Seems to be something I’m hearing more and more of lately and my therapist agrees.

Maybe people are finally realising the link between all of these things and trauma/attachment issues. 

The amount of women especially who are misdiagnosed with BPD when infact they’ve had ADHD since childhood that was badly managed/noticed etc is interesting. This alone can cause symptoms of BPD due to the damage it has on a child’s self esteem to be seen as ‘naughty’ ‘hyperactive’ etc. 

The stigma I experience if I say I have BPD rather then ADHD is insane and frightening when the two can be so very similar.

Find the thing you love and chase it, find meaning in something bigger then you.

Therapy, support (I’m hoping you have someone you trust in your life), helping others, forgiving yourself, learning everything you can about this disorder so you can preempt it and learning to love yourself. These are the things that helped me. 

I am no longer toxic but it took time. You have to somehow be patient with yourself if possible (I know it’s exhausting).

Play therapy uses a child’s natural language of play to heal rather then forcing them to talk, ignoring their requests and yelling at them to change.

We expect children to ‘respect’ adults who do not respect them. We blame children for ‘behaviour’ when adults around them are neither safe nor trustworthy.

My belief is that with acceptance, patience and following their lead that children can play out their experiences in therapy and make sense of their trauma through a healthy therapeutic relationship.

BPD is a relationship disorder and play therapy is a relationship therapy. 

Everything leads back to attachment. 

I was also considered a sociopathic nightmare as a child when I was just hurt, just as the kids I work with are.

My interest comes from the deep knowing that I was misdiagnosed and misunderstood for so many years and not wanting another child to experience that 🧡"

Thank you all 🧡"
BPD,fhoegku,t1_fhodvq7,1581752572.0,I expect the ‘average’ person to learn as we with BPD have had to in order to somewhat fit into a society that often makes people want to kill themselves!!!!!
BPD,fhoe91g,t3_f3n7mx,1581752283.0,"Your message means a lot to me and I will remember it now when meeting those who do not understand.

Thank you for taking the time to validate my feelings on this and to share yours."

Riddle me that 😢

Super common for women with hyperactive ADHD like myself."
BPDrecovery,fhjr6py,t1_fhj6mpw,1581653310.0,"Woah. I’m the exact same. My personality is a little fragmented between ages as you said. Even gave mine names (I’m imaginative and love writing, not diagnosed with DID, just BPD.) I also self soothe with plushies and blankets etc.

Super interesting to see someone else feels like this! Thanks ☺️"

Also slightly badass! Intense (but still a bit badass Soz reddit haha)"
BPD,fhdakwb,t3_f2gds9,1581481065.0,"So unreal! I’m seriously in the exact same position! 6 years together, mutual break up, me craving comfort, her being forced to tell me it’s totally done. Conquering a fear somehow! 

Proud of ya but also ahhhh 😭 bpd and breakups are just the worst. 

Thank you for this!"
childfree,fh7cb7r,t3_f1niib,1581324409.0,"Think you’re being a little bit selfish possibly. They are going through something really difficult and it sounds like you care about them or hopefully you do as you called them friends.

I work with special needs kids and families who have friends walk away because it’s ‘too hard’ all the time and it’s really lonely for them. Most of my families have no friends left due to their friends ‘not understanding’ or finding their reality ‘too confronting’.

It’s already isolating. I hope this doesn’t read as a dig at you by any means, I can understand that it can be tiring or difficult to be around but it would probably mean a lot to them to have someone check in once a month for a coffee or something."
