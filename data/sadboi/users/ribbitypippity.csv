shrooms,fqhm7s6,t1_fqhkfgy,1589379837.0,It definitely is. But I haven't got it in me to give up right now lol. I just can't deal with any more withdrawal and mental health stuff right now. I'm going to try and taper instead. Man I even get withdrawals from giving up weed these days!!
shrooms,fqhfgmr,t1_fqhemiy,1589375870.0,Ah ok. I read that. I'm on an anti depressant too. Thanks for showing me that. I'm hopeful my brain just needs to return to normal chemistry. I'm extremely sensitive to changes in brain chemistry. It's why I don't really do any drugs except smoke weed anymore.
shrooms,fqhf1y0,t1_fqhe4i4,1589375617.0,Ha ha yeah. The funny thing was I took 5 grams a couple of weeks ago and had the best trip I've probably ever had. I've done a few trips in my life but to be honest I'm more of a ketamine man (I hope that's not like swearing in this sub). I've done acid and shrooms a few times and had good experiences. But I honestly find shrooms too hard for me. They seem so dose specific and it's very hard for me to get the right dose. If this anxiety ever goes away I might try microdosing but in honesty this last experience has put me right off!! If I smoke weed now I start seeing things out the corner of my eye and stuff. Maybe I need to stop smoking it. Don't worry I've dug in the trash for weed too lol and I wasn't even tripping when I threw it away.
shrooms,fqhdct9,t1_fqgv7rr,1589374535.0,"I also grew loads. I intended to microdose but decided I'd have a trip or two first. First heavy trip was amazing. But this next one I took 3g and I could barely see. My vision was covered in spirals, but it didn't feel pleasant. It felt empty and depressing. I was really sick too like all I could do was curl up in a ball and was sick over and over whilst tripping absolute balls. The hallucinations subsided but even 3 days later I was still seeing things slightly. The anxiety has been intense and I'm kind of worried I've fucked my mind. Now I'm 4 days since that trip and I feel mega depressed and anxious. Probably the worst I've felt in many years. So I think I might have to just accept that it's not for me. I've had long standing anxiety problems regardless but the last trip has made them ten times worse for me. It's disappointing and upsetting for me. I dunno what I did wrong. I felt mentally ok before the trip."
shrooms,fqgo0g2,t1_fqg14c9,1589351650.0,Made my anxiety worse by a lot. after taking 3g I am still having panic attacks days later. When I microdose I get anxiety. I have had one good trip out of about five which seemed to provide some relief from mental health symptoms. But I'm giving up on them as they have a profoundly bad effect on my anxiety.

microdosing,fpjo0ah,t3_gda57a,1588675555.0,A slight mood lift and an increased sense of mindfulness. I tend to concentrate more on the here and now rather than worrying about the future or ruminating on the past.
microdosing,fpjmr7v,t1_fpjmggh,1588674295.0,No worries. Best of luck!!
microdosing,fpjisq6,t1_fpjiajl,1588670089.0,"Yeah that's maybe true, especially if you can find a way like you've done to standardise the dose. 

I prefer mushrooms because I can grow them so don't need to worry about using dnm, although I have in the past many times. My last two orders did not turn up!! Then I had all the worry of had they been intercepted etc etc. But nothing came of it. They just didn't turn up. I suspect I was ripped off.

To account for any inconsistencies in strength of the mushrooms I grind them all up together and then mix the powder up thoroughly. 

I've noticed that microdose mushrooms makes me very mindful. So I only think about the here and now really. I've only just started though 

Prior to microdosing I've only had full trips on both acid and shrooms to compare. Had an incredible experience on mushrooms, so stuck with them. 

What will you do?"

unclebens,fpalotb,t1_fpakwbi,1588450741.0,"I see what you mean.

So you could hold the tub upside down and just make sure you use your hand to stop the cake from breaking apart. They're quite firm so it should be easy. Cut the mushroom off and put it all back the way you found it. Continue misting etc as normal.

Or if it won't come out easy just by tipping it upside down then you could fill the container full of water which will cause the substrate to float to the surface. Then you could do what I said above. 

Then just continue as normal.

Edit: I mean just take the cake out of the tub. Just for clarity."

Someone else recommended to me first having a full trip and then microdosing after that.

The trip wasn't bad. But it was kind of confusing and too much anxiety for me to feel like I made any meaningful observations on myself and my situation.

The thing that I was finding difficult was it was just a vague feeling of general anxiety. I couldn't really link it to any thought. 

Also was feeling kind of confused in my thinking so was hard to form any sort of meaningful internal dialogue with myself. 

Any tips? I guess just meditation and deep breathing to try and focus.
