**Who can apply?**

Currently enrolled full-time and part-time students (including graduate students) can apply to the university for funding to offset expenses incurred related to housing, food, and technology and course materials.

The higher education emergency relief grants are based on student expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), and the funding is not tied to existing financial aid programs such as the Pell Grant. The money will be distributed directly to students as quickly as possible.

**To be eligible for this funding, students must**:

    Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen (i.e., eligible to receive federal Title IV aid).
    Be (or have been) enrolled in a degree-seeking or post-baccalaureate teacher certificate program for Spring 2020.
    Not have been enrolled exclusively in online courses for the spring semester on or prior to March 12, 2020.
    Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements.
    Not be in default on a federal student loan or owe an overpayment on any federal grant.
    Have a high school diploma or GED.
    Have a valid Social Security number.
    Be registered with Selective Service (if required).
    Not have a federal or state conviction for drug possession or sale.

*Your actual eligibility will be based on the above requirements and your answers to the supplemental questions. The award amount will depend on the number of applicants and the availability of funds.*
  
  
**How do I qualify?**

To qualify for this emergency grant, you must be Title IV eligible and have expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. In other words, you do not need to have submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you just need to be eligible to do so."

texas,for572o,t1_for4my7,1588006369.0,"Multiple reasons going into this, but I think it's an infrastructure thing. I'm from Laredo in Webb County (340 cases at the bottom of the map) and one of the jokes we hear a lot is that you need to drive three hours (into San Antonio, Corpus, down the border) to find people. There's a whole lot of small towns, but not much else. Many of them are just a little collection of gas stations and - when the oil rush came - hotels. The health system that way isn't going to be as developed. I have no doubt there are more infections, but there's not a way to count them, or much by way of testing for these areas. I'm of the mind there's a great number of infections going under the radar. But the most populous areas, with access to hospitals, etc, more resources are of course going to be able to count their cases. This is true if you look at [flu season numbers](https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/IDCU/disease/influenza/surveillance/2019-2020.aspx), too. A great many places in Tx just don't report.

txstate,foqps00,t1_foqnozv,1587998580.0,"I think the ""have a life"" question is more to do with your personal habits. I've always been able to prioritize my time well and didn't have any trouble keeping up with deadlines, so it didn't hurt me. However -- and I think this is general advice I'd give to anyone -- please do the readings. And please don't wait until the last-minute to start papers. I had sooooo many classmates wait until a week before the paper was due and then spend a week cramming to get their assignments in. If you can avoid that you'll do just fine.  
  
Double majoring didn't hurt my GPA or impact my grad chances. But, again, that's going to come down to you as a person than the degree itself. Don't make it harder for yourself: do your readings, manage your time well. If you have to write a 20 page paper, don't put off until the last minute. Seriously I cannot say enough: DO THE READINGS, because your classes are very discussion based and you will be evil-eyed by your professor when you don't do 'em. It's very obv. to tell who does 'em and who doesn't. I had a philosophy professor once kick out like 75% of the class because almost everyone straight up admitted they didn't do the readings, lol.   
  
I am really glad you enjoyed your philosophy class. I actually got into philosophy much the same way. I took an intro class my freshman year of college and couldn't get enough. Then I took another intro course when I came back to Texas...and then I took an existentialism course (as an English major) and read Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche, etc...it was awesome!!!! When I transferred to TxSt, I elected to go for the double-major route because I had all my basics done, wanted to take beyond the three classes (is it four?) you need for a minor in philosophy, and it wasn't going to take much extra time too, it turns out.  
  
Here's something else about philosophy, too. You're going to see a lot of know-it-alls (I think this is true in any discipline), who looooove throwing around how much time they spend studying XYZ obscure-ass niche philosopher and how they can name-drop the entire history of western phil at the blink of an eye. But you also have people like yourself (and like my husband, who got a graduate degree in philosophy after getting a biology degree) who have interest and passion for the subject. Profs love that! Remember the origin of the word: philo-sophia. Love of *wisdom*. You will do sooo well and gain sooooo much from the discipline, no matter what level you come from.
  
PS -- I would recommend meeting with an advisor to discuss how much additional time throwing on the other major would take you on top of your English courses. The advisors in liberal arts are all very sweet and excellent resources."
txstate,foqaol8,t3_g8qa1i,1587988600.0,"I can answer your second question, because I was an English/Philosophy double major. I‚Äôm going to come right off the bat and say a double major is never necessarily ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù but my courses did compliment each other very well. A lot of what you learn in philosophy is a benefit to you when you‚Äôre in English classes and vice versa. Logic (required for phil majors) helps you understand basic writing structure and fallacies. Your understanding of theory (you learn a lot of theory in English) is more informed by learning the history of philosophy. And there are English and Philosophy upper division courses you can explore that often seems like they could really be offered in the other department. I.e I took a French critical theory course in English, and a creativity course in philosophy. I did a lot of reading, and a lot of writing. Hundreds of pages (no joke) of reading a week, and not all of it is fun *cough* Hegel. Writing never ends either. You will have regular 10+ page papers as an undergrad, and I‚Äôd be surprised if you ever took a multiple choice exam again in your upper-division classes.
  
There are absolutely AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING FACULTY IN BOTH DEPARTMENTS. There are some you‚Äôll want to avoid (PM me and I can give some more info), but I recommend Tally, Morrison, Kapurch, Schwebel, Wend-Walker, Parks, Cassells (the latter two are absolutely brilliant poets) in English. I loved McKinney, Fisher, Benedikt, Carson (I think she‚Äôs retired tho), and (controversially) Hutcheson in Philosophy.

The SRC called me yesterday and said the same thing: looks like more than likely they will not reopen until the Fall semester.  
  
Just some information for y'all...there are dozens of people at TxSt who want to make sure above all else that campus is **safe** before we bring people back. We all want to come back to work, we all want to be back in our offices and resume classroom teaching. We want y'all to come back to campus!!! Obviously this is not an ideal situation. But I do need y'all to know that no, TxSt is not waiting to make y‚Äôall sign leases or collect deposits or anything like that.  
  
The fact of the matter is we really just don't know yet. As of now (April 22), Fall is going on per usual and we are planning to have face-to-face instruction...but the outbreak situation also changes week to week. I would say maybe in six weeks we might have a clearer picture. We have had some professors make a shift toward more online teaching (those in high-risk groups, for example) but it's not being mandated like in Summer, and even these are just requests at this point.

txstate,fo0p3sf,t3_g4ye2r,1587417156.0,"So, I'm going to be honest with you about a few things. First is that nobody really cares where you went to college past your first job, and even then, it's not a big deal. As someone who's a current hiring manager I am going to be interested in your grades, service, that sort of thing vs seeing ""I went to [big school]"" on your resume. Like that's cool, but what did you *do* there? As you advance in the field, where you went to school matters less and less, IMO.  
  
Secondly, I would do some firsthand research on both schools themselves if you haven't already. Do you know what research is being done in the programs you're interested in at both schools? Have you been on their website? Do you know the kind of work done at Texas State? You say ""as far as I'm aware, bio isn't strong at TxSt,"" but where are you hearing that from and what have you found to confirm that? You are allowed to contact the departments themselves, too. We love prospective students. There's probably brochures you can find somewhere on the site with info about the degree programs you're interested in. And departments love-love sharing all the good news we're up to! Find some reviews on faculty, and read about the reseach they're doing. Think about how that aligns with the experience you want out of college.  
  
Third -- your university experience is what you and only you make of it. Don't pick a school because it has a ""better name"" than another. Pick it because you feel it is the right place in your heart for you. Think about what you want out of your university [experience](https://www.txstate.edu/commonexperience/stories/leading-the-way.html). Is it [clubs](https://www.lbjsc.txstate.edu/soc/join/search-orgs.html)? Is it robust [research](https://www.research.txstate.edu/)? What about the [city](https://stories.txstate.edu/uniquely-texas-state/things-to-do.html) in general? Can you see yourself living in San Marcos?
  
I transferred into TxSt from a big out of state school, finished my undergraduate degree and my master's here, and now work here. I am not going to sell you TxSt. If you like UT better, go to UT. If you feel TxSt can be good for you, come to TxSt. But don't make your decision based on what you hear from others. [Read](https://hillviews.txstate.edu/issues/2019/the-big-picture.html) about it yourself."

That being said, do not feel pressured to sign a lease now. Enrollment is projected to be ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è and I actually think with everyone having left town and less students coming there will be plenty of space available in the coming months for you. Unless you have a very specific place you want to live, I would say sign up for your classes and then see how things are looking in a few weeks.

Also, why would you be getting in touch with Dr. Thorne?

I don‚Äôt see where DT would play info any communication. Do you work in JCK, maybe?
  
  
I am really wondering where, specifically, you work that‚Äôs making you come for 40 hours a week. If you feel uncomfortable divulging, DM me. We might already know each other. The world of staff is pretty tight-knit, after all. I haven‚Äôt heard of entire offices being made to stay."

As the outbreak plays out, things are going to change. Right now we're planning week to week, with some general long-term planning, and waiting for upper administration to provide guidance. :(
