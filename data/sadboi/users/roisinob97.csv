Edit: just to say, obviously anything is better than nothing in terms of keeping your hands clean. But regular hand washing will be needed as well as a non-alcohol rub.

The current plan of attack is to run a takeaway service, to keep our heads above water through the worst of this. Us waiting staff are planning to work as delivery people for a while.

It's not a foolproof method, but it's a way to limit time that people are in the restaurant. As well as deliver to our older customers that regularly (mostly daily) come in for their dinner.

I think for now, we need to be smarter in these fields. I notice many small businesses around taking to social media, especially clothes shops, providing customers with the ability to pay online and get what they ordered delivered. Obviously, this isn't possible for all businesses, but I see many businesses asking people to buy vouchers, to use when everything gets back to normal.

A 12 hour shift with no break is no joke, I did it once and was not well for a week after. There is nothing to be gained yourself from skipping lunch, and on top of that, especially in office culture, it turns into a ""hey, why are you taking a break?"" even when you're very much entitled to it.

I think where it all falls apart is the link between one scientific paper with quite a promising conclusion, and the press hopping on the bandwagon about it saying it's revolutionary, and then The wider population expects it to come into force next week and the world is saved. 

That just can't happen, and I really think the scientific process through to development and clinical studies and impact studies need to be shown to the wider population. I had an argument with a woman on reddit last week who was claiming scientists are doing nothing by way of developing a cancer therapy. She claimed since she hears one thing about a breakthrough drug  then nothing for years, that it just must not exist. My explanation fell on deaf ears, however, so I gave up."

Two sessions is all I received as I was a public patient, in a low risk age as I was only 21. Even though I made explicitly clear the pain I was in even after 6 weeks of the exercises given.

I started in Pilates, and the instructor realised all my pain was stemming from tight leg muscles, gave me an exercise routine, no pain for months. But now, I'm in college sitting at a desk for hours on end because I have so much for my thesis to get finished..  The pain is back, but I can stretch and manage it. 

My compliance to the routine dropped, my pain rose. Let me just say as well that I do not blame the PT, I could not afford a private PT and had to go public, and let's just say Ireland's public medical sextor is less than helpful because the medical professionals are underpaid, over worked and really underfunded."

I was 20, in my second year of college, and hadn't been home for about 3 weeks because of college work etc. My mam collected me and brought me home for the week after. We came in my driveway at home, and there was a little pile of something on the front lawn.

It was my dog. Lifeless and bleeding. Wrapped up in a blanket. She had got out while my mam was away collecting me and some asshole came along, ran her over killing her instantly and didn't even stop. My neighbour was so kind to return her to our garden and ran over when he saw us home. I was inconsolable, I hated myself for being away so long. 

Dogs are better than people, and some nasty person killed my dog that day. She was getting old and I knew that some day I'd have to say goodbye. But that was the cruelest, saddest way. I miss her so much, it's been 2 years."

I'm currently investigating novel drug delivery systems, and the amount of work that has to go in to make absolute sure that no isomerism takes place, and that the configuration of the active molecule isn't affected by the loading or imprinting of the molecule into the carrier is just mind boggling.."
science,f5fzdce,t1_f5fxcom,1572188191.0,"It was also used as a treatment for morning sickness. Therefore a harrowing amount of babies were born with birth defects, most notably deformation of limbs. It was due to a racemic mixture of stereoisomers of the drug being administered: one had the therapeutic effect, the other caused defects in the foetus. Absolutely horrible. 

This is one of the main reasons why the EU reg bodies and the FDA set up stringent regulations in terms of research and development of pharmaceuticals. Thanks to all of this tragedy, we have a safer method of clinical trials for humans. Racemic mixtures of drug molecules are now not allowed to be marketed, unless there is very strong evidence to show that the other isomer does not produce an effect. Therefore, much more development is needed for drugs and it takes much longer."

AskScienceDiscussion,eva94gx,t3_cixpsz,1564341921.0,"We had two classes like this, one taught politics and current affairs but nobody cared because 60% of the grade went to a stupid project that the teacher picked (ours was how to run a presidential election), and if you listened to everything the teacher told you to write in that, you could bluff past the 40% written.

The second was about looking after yourself, families and how taxes and applying for jobs work, but the teachers were just roped into these classes and just let us do homework and watch movies. Not a help at all. The school system was way too academic, you didn't care how to look after yourself after school because all emphasis was on getting the best grades to get into the best colleges.

The monotony can be unbearable at times, and that Sunday dread is the worst feeling! All I'll say is I'm happy I have my weekends and routined free time, after 4 years as a waitress, having an office job with weekends off and 9-5 weekday shifts is glorious! 

Something I've also started doing is planning day trips/activities for Sunday. It takes my mind off the dread. Also, leaving work in work. When you walk out of the office, forget about the place until the next morning. It allows you to separate your life, and let you take your free time back. Easier said than done, you just need to adjust your brain to forget work after your shift. Took me about a month or two.

If all else fails, a career change is daunting but could be the best thing. Some people work in the same place for 30 odd years and are fine. Others change careers yearly! If you're really not happy, and can afford it, a career break or something like that may be the breath if fresh air you may need!

work,etl4n7w,t1_etl2mcx,1562921344.0,"Thanks for your advice! I forgot to add in that I had tried to speak to her about how I have been feeling, but that was met with backlash and her erupting at me, saying I was the cause of all this stress. I tried to act as adult as I could, but she is clearly just a child that doesn't like to be told she's wrong or the cause of something negative.

At the moment, the most mature action I can do is simply ignore her and try to find individual work to do. Situations like this don't seem to be handled well here, my supervisor basically just said ""shit happens"" to me, no repercussions for her actions, but if I'm ""feeling overwhelmed"" I can go home.

AskScienceDiscussion,etbnnbm,t3_catlaf,1562653453.0,"Size can be down to the size of a dose within a pill and the ratio of the active ingredients to the fillers, lubricants etc. This helps drug delivery in vivo, thanks to dissolution time and the time it takes for the active ingredients to reach the site of action in the body. This is also affected by shape.

Size and shape is also down to the patients, tablets must be small enough to allow an adequate mouth-feel and to be able to swallow whole easily. Breaking up tablets may be necessary but not always helpful in terms of efficacy. So smaller tablets are much more desired.

As for colour, not 100% sure but most probably to colour code tablets, some require specific coatings that may have a colour. Marketing probably has a good say too! I think it's a visual placebo trick, the nicer looking tablets look better quality and therefore the patient will think it works better, think of the fight of generic tablets against the blockbusters!"

Having said all these, there are a small certain few that wear makeup and get away with it. I really don't see the point though, it's more stressful than anything and you'll eventually be told to cut it out!"
