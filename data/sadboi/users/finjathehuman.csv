Thank you very much!

That sounds like a good alternative. For me, I would be a little worried about my teeth with a horseshoe there but that's a personal choice I guess :)"

piercing,fpjl5eo,t1_fpjkffs,1588672633.0,"Funny thing, I actually don't like the look of a normal labret one me at all, I don't know why haha
But I think I will keep the vertical one in mind, maybe I will have the balls in the next 10 years or so.. Or maybe it will just be the septum :)"
piercing,fpjjq4p,t1_fpjf3nq,1588671089.0,"Thanks for your honest response :) I'm more insecure about that one too, but mainly because of the pain, haha!"
mentalhealth,foarkti,t1_foaqpys,1587651338.0,"Oh, okay! That's annoying :( In Germany we can still go outside so I didn't consider this, sorry. Maybe you can still find a way to do some exercise inside. I sometimes use an app to do back exercises or these (I don't know what they're called) fitness loop bands."
mentalhealth,foaqg47,t3_g6n0wo,1587650890.0,"Same here, my therapist just told me today to engage in sports daily so my stress level will lower and the overthinking will occur less. Hopefully this helps a little at least. :)"

That sounds cool, you'll love them!"

Right now I'm perfectly satisfied with the size I'm at. I really like bigger sizes on other people but right now my tunnels look pretty big to me. But I guess that will maybe change in some years, let's see :)"

adhdwomen,fno1fmm,t1_fno0n6b,1587108602.0,"I think that's why I'm so afraid to talk about it... I know some people that were diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and one person even told me that I do not fit the criteria and that it's a childhood thing anyway. Also that I cannot have it since I'm a girl...

But I will try and talk to my current therapist about it. Hopefully she is kind of specialized, I don't even know this, I went to her when I was absolutely desperate so I didn't consider this to be too important.

But if she brushes it off I could maybe go to the therapist one of my best friends went to some weeks ago. He got his diagnosis after his first appointment.

Thanks for your advice!

Edit: I will also try the screening test, totally forgot to mention it in my reply. Thank you!"

These comics are amazing and I just saved like half of them because I can relate a lot.
Now I feel like I have enough courage to actually talk to my therapist about this next week. :)"

It's really hard to stay positive atm and that's just one thing that helps me a little bit."
mentalhealth,fms3v8d,t3_fx2qdr,1586345719.0,"Oh, definitely. I'm having a lot of trouble adapting to all the changes and not being able to meet and hug my friends.. I'm so grateful that I can still go to therapy, otherwise I would be in a much worse place.

To all of you struggling, keep your head up, my therapist always tells me that we know that this is temporary, it's not like in war or something where you don't know when it all ends. I believe in you. :)"

Anxietyhelp,fl9eo3d,t3_fnaowg,1584952239.0,"Hey, I'm dealing with this kind of panic attacks too atm and my therapist told me about the physical reason of feeling like you can't breathe.
It's because when you are breathig really fast your body tries to minimize your oxygen intake. It therefore kind of restricts your inhales and you're feeling this uncomfortable feeling in your throat as if you are being suffocated. But this is just your body's response to save you from inhaling too much oxygen. (I hope this makes sense somehow, it's a little hard to describe this in english)

Knowing this helped me a lot and it reminds me of the fact that I will not suffocate or have a heart attack although it feels like it."
