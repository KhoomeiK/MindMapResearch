It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed right now and feel fearful.  And then hopefully balance it with things that will keep you going.  I read once somewhere that 'worrying is praying for what we don't want.'  I keep reminding myself of this as my mind just wants to worry about everything right now!  And then I take deep breaths and pray for what I do want.  

May you and your family and everyone you know and everyone you don't know come through this trying time, strong and healthy and ready to move forward.  Sending love to you!"

He does still end up with relationship drama in his life though, haha, but it's a compelling story of trying to live a simple, profound life and going against societal expectations and materialistic desires."

Perhaps you could speak to a school counselor?  They might be able to give you some advice, it's their job to be there for you.  Or do you have any friends whose house you could stay at?

Assistance,fby77t5,t3_eevzt7,1577209771.0,"Hi there.  I'm not the best at talking to strangers but I really wanted to say hello and let you know that I'm out here listening and I know how hard it can be.  Please try to not be too hard on yourself, we can beat ourselves up when times are tough but it just really isn't an easy world and struggling doesn't mean you're a bad person!  

I can tell that you want to turn things around and be there for your kids, which is lovely.  If I were in Colorado I would happily invite you out for a meal and a conversation.  Last year at this time I didn't have work, food, or know anyone, so I know how it goes.  This year things are moderately better so I encourage you to hang in there as life is full of surprises and things can unexpectedly change for the better.

I still don't have a lot, but as my luck has changed a bit I would like to offer you something.  Would a motel room for the night give your spirits a boost?   I know a hot shower and a bed can be uplifting and you could relax and call your kids?  If there is a reasonably priced place that you know of in Denver, please give me the contact info and I will call them and book you a room.  Just want you to know that you're not alone, even if it feels like it right now."
