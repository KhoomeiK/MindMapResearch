That being said, these med adjustments are common--par for the course. I take bupropion and zoloft plus other meds. For what it is worth, I take the highest dosage of bupropion allowed, and I take it all in the morning. This helps with the sleeping issue. Bupropion gives me a little motivation and ""pep"" to get me going. Zoloft almost magically stopped my crying spells, but it makes me sleepy so I take it at night. Those days when I could not control my crying, no matter the context, zoloft helped with that. It also helps my social anxiety. I don't know how old you are, but you are new to meds. To give a brief introduction into the abyss, there will be adjustments based on your response. You will probably have a cocktail of sorts that ends up working for you. Most meds take up to 6 weeks to produce robust results. Hang in there and just communicate everything you experience very clearly with your doctor. Keep a log if you need to.

During 2012-2013 I was in grad school. During the 2012 semester at the beginning of treatment, I did not notice any cognitive impairment, but in the 2013 semester, toward the end of treatments, I did notice cognitive impairment. Things I could typically do quite well, such as writing, synthesizing or summarizing complex information in writing, and/or reading something rather complex and being able to not only remember it but discuss and analyze it--I could not do. I dropped my classes that semester because I just couldn't do those things no matter how hard I tried. It was scary for me to experience that.

Or, change over to a different antidepressant, possibly an SSRI and add the booster. It is something that works for me after incredibly long-term SSRI use. My doctor actually lets me take the booster along with my antidepressants for about a year or so until I am doing very well consistently, then I drop the booster.

ect,feybszr,t3_epml08,1579443423.0,"As InfiniteLearner pointed out, there are many treatment variables involved that can be tweaked. To point out a couple more, are you on any meds? What is your primary reason for getting ECT? I have had two rounds of bilateral treatments only and was told that bilateral would work more quickly than unilateral. I was suicidal and depressed to the point that I could not function. I was functioning better and no longer suicidal after 3-4 treatments. I have read articles arguing that the two methods are equally effective, but I have also read articles stating that bilateral was more effective.  I personally think it depends on the individual's unique response to treatment and what is being treated. If unilateral works for you but doesn't seem to last long, maybe meds or med adjustments would help. Only your doctor can really discuss your options with you and speak to your specific concerns."
ect,fegd676,t1_fedqfk9,1579088435.0,"I think sometimes the concern is that you will be driving and get lost. During the acute phase--although everyone reacts differently--you can kind of get stuck in a brain fog and become forgetful out of the blue (this is temporary if it happens). But, you could be perfectly fine driving somewhere and then all of a sudden forget how to get back home or another similar scenario. This is why I suggest waiting to see how things go before bringing it up again with your doctor. This may not happen to you. Also, could you perhaps arrange for family or friends to visit or take you out places? Maybe prepare beforehand by having things at home to keep you occupied. Anything you are typically interested in that you enjoy. Jigsaw puzzles, a list of movies you want to watch, books, sudoku, hobbies, whatever works for you. You will need a good bit of rest, so plan on that especially on treatment days. I loved alone during my treatments and tried to keep the tv on or music on for background noise, which helped.

On treatment days I was just really tired and didn't have enough energy to do anything.

ect,fe98c28,t3_eo5adn,1578935292.0,"This is what I posted before in response to a question about cognitive abilities and ect: I have had 2 rounds of bilateral ECT: 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. During 2012-2013 I was in grad school. During the 2012 semester at the beginning of treatment, I did not notice any cognitive impairment, but in the 2013 semester, toward the end of treatments, I did notice cognitive impairment. Things I could typically do quite well, such as writing, synthesizing or summarizing complex information in writing, and/or reading something rather complex and being able to not only remember it but discuss and analyze it--I could not do. I dropped my classes that semester because I just couldn't do those things no matter how hard I tried. It was scary for me to experience that. Luckily, after about 3 months or so, it all started coming back,  and I was at the same level cognitively as I had been before. In 2017-2018 I held (and still hold) a full-time job. I am a writer and editor for scientific journals and work with mainly geneticists to whip their publications into shape--so lots of cognitive ability needed. I did not lose any cognitive ability at all during this second round of treatments. I have no idea what was different, but I guess it illustrates that there are no hard and fast rules or outcomes when it comes to ECT. But, yeah, when I did have decreased cognitive abilities I was terrified that I wouldn't get them back. I did, though. Again, just my personal experience, but there is definitely hope. Also, most of my memory problems occurred when I had treatments multiple times per week--luckily I did not forget anything too significant like how to perform my job or the knowledge I had acquired necessary for my job. Things did get better week by week after my last treatment. Again, the worst cognitive impairment I experienced came back after about 3 months after my last treatment in 2013. I hope everything works out in your favor and best to you."

As you work to get to the bottom of your issues (and if you don't, you will continue the same behaviors) perhaps the counselor can recommend a dietitian and/or program to help get you where you want to be.

ect,fcltgvq,t1_fck6eg9,1577756061.0,"Of all of the treatments available for depression, ECT is the riskiest. This is according to all of the scientific  research I have read and according to my doctor who studied at  John's Hopkins. Bilateral treatment IS riskier than unilateral treatment. It is not risky in the sense of life or  death risky, it is risky in the sense of its potentially life-altering side effects. Severe anterograde and/or retrograde memory loss. Severe cognitive impairment. Meds are not as risky in the potential side effects department. Are you suggesting ECT should be offered up as a treatment option before medication? Are you suggesting there is a treatment for depression that is riskier than ECT? Are you suggesting that the doctors at Yale have found through scientific research that ECT should be an option to treat depression on the same level as medication because it is not any riskier? Again, death from ECT is not the risk I am referring to. It is the risk of potentially life-altering side effects that can potentially significantly decrease a person's quality of life. But this powerful and risky treatment also has the potential to significantly improve a person's quality of life. If it isn't the treatment of last resort for depression, then what is? Can you point me to a scientific article/literature that suggests that ECT is NOT the treatment of last resort for depression? It only matters to me because I think less risky alternatives should be used first and foremost in the treatment regimen for depression. If these safer alternatives do not work or the patient is not responsive then ECT could potentially be an option. Hence, the last treatment offered in a line of many available treatments."
ect,fcjz3js,t1_fcjw2hn,1577711241.0,"With the disclaimer that everyone responds differently and there is no sure way of knowing whether or not you will have long-term effects,  the only long-term effect I have is memory loss. Some things that happened in the past before and during treatment, I cannot remember. Luckily it doesn't seem to be anything significant. Mostly things like movies I watched, books I read, places I have been, conversations, etc. Nothing big like how to do my job or the basic knowledge I picked up in school. I did have short-term cognitive impairment for about 3-6 months after my last treatment in my first series. That was terrifying because I had no idea if my normal cognitive functioning would return. Thankfully, it did. Best to you."
ect,fcjulks,t1_fcjopge,1577705509.0,"Did your doctor offer ECT as a treatment option or do you just want to try it? Do you know what had to happen for it to even be offered to me as an option (because it is a treatment of last resort and the risks you mentioned are possible)? I was hospitalized 3 times. I tried different meds from the age of 14 to the age of 36 and nothing worked for any significant period of time and most didn't work at all--at least 20 different meds altogether and many different combinations of those meds. Finally ECT and it saved my life and is very effective for me. This is partly the point I was trying to make. ECT can work for people but the memory and cognitive issues/risks are real and it should remain a treatment of last resort. Nothing works perfectly. Your meds will never work perfectly although some can work better for you than others. There is no cure for depression. One has to take the treatment at hand and put forth serious effort to find ways to try to manage or combat it on his or her own. So, when people go around saying how wonderful ECT is, and we don't respect or allow the serious risks involved to be discussed, we have people who think it is just another option equal to medication. No biggie. I would certainly hope that there aren't doctors out there offering up ECT just because a few meds haven't worked and someone wants to give it a whirl. It is definitely too risky for that. ECT definitely doesn't cure depression or work perfectly. No one can say with any certainty what the side effects will be for you--short-term or long-term.

ect,fcjcni3,t3_ehgz0s,1577683120.0,"ECT definitely helped me, and IMHO you are mischaracterizing or haven't read enough of the comments on this subreddit if you think it is overwhelmingly negative. The fact is that ECT is a treatment of last resort because of the risks involved. I, and perhaps you, are willing to take those risks and dare I say overlook any negative side effects because we feel the positive improvements outweigh them. I have nothing but positive things to say about my experiences with ECT, but that doesn't give me a right to devalue or  invalidate or even judge (by labeling something positive or negative) others' experiences with ECT. I am right there with you when it comes to encouraging those people who really could benefit from it to try it, but the truth is that there are risks involved and people need a place to be able to discuss the risks/side effects in order to possibly not be afraid and to cope during and after treatment.  I am 43F btw and had 2 separate series of ECT--2012-2013 and 2017-2018. I am doing great. I even worked and went to grad school during treatments and that is wonderful for me; however, the truth is that everyone responds differently, and all of our experiences are valid, whether or not someone wants to label them as positive or negative. Just like I want to scream from the rooftops that ECT saved my life on 2 occasions and will probably do so at some point again, I also respect that some people experience serious, life-altering side effects, and they want to share their experiences as well. The only thing we know for sure is that ECT is a treatment of last resort because it carries high risks of cognitive impairment and memory loss, etc. I am glad it worked for you and that your experience was positive. I had a total of 24 then 20 bilateral treatments (the riskiest) and the benefits outweighed the memory loss and cognitive impairment for me because most of those things improved about 4 months after treatments ended and some memory issues were resolved. I only say all of this because I feel not that many people per capita receive ECT, and it is a unique experience for everyone. Those of us who have experienced it should respect and honor all experiences. It is not all doom and gloom and torture and virtual lobotomies, but it is also not all roses and sunshine and the best course of action for everyone.  I am glad you are doing well, and I hope you continue to make progress. Best to you."
askphilosophy,fc7em2l,t3_egk4gq,1577505127.0,"I did not ask to be born. Someone made that decision for me. Why should I have to suffer and be kept alive in a life I never wanted to begin with? Just a thought. I have been suicidal and attempted suicide before, and I was ""kept alive"" by physicians. I want to live now, and I am not suicidal--just making the point that I have been there. It is interesting to me that people rarely include in this discussion how the life began in the first place. The last time I was suicidal, I refused to leave the hospital until I actually wanted to be alive--my argument being you people brought me into this world without my permission/choice--you made every effort against my will to keep me alive--you are going to make me better or let me die (this ended up in quite a long stay whereas before, I just simply SAID I was not suicidal so I could leave hospital). I had ECT treatments and I am very well now with an advanced degree and complex job (in case you are questioning my ability to think rationally or logically). I just wanted to throw the circumstance of birth into the mix as it seems to be addressed rarely in these kinds of arguments. If giving birth is a human right, then how does that further illuminate this discussion? Does it even matter? I suppose due to elitist rules of this subreddit, these questions and explorations were deemed unphilosohical and unresesrched. That is a shame because it was one of the most interesting topics I have seen here in a while. I will reread Kant as one person suggested, but, now, unfortunately, I have no other philosophers/philosophical writings to research on the matter.
