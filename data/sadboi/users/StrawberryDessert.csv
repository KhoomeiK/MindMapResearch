aspergers,fr0tdi8,t3_glxhy5,1589806260.0,It sounds crazy to me that your family is getting mad because you watched an episode without them. I mean I can hardly understand why it would be a big deal let alone a continued issue. You were watching it for good reasons too which I can understand. So please don’t feel bad. I mean you meant well by watching it alone and even if it sort of bothers people they shouldn’t be controlling to that extent right? I mean but I am sorry this is stressing you and maybe a little time will help things.

aspergers,fpvb2ca,t3_gfrlxf,1588940492.0,It sounds like your family environment may have a lot to do with the breakdowns. Being friendless sucks but at the very least home should be a pleasant place. :( Maybe just try to focus on getting through this (school) so you can support yourself later on and establish a better way of life in the future. I know its easier said than done.. but its easier to do it now than to have to go back to school later on. Sorry you’re going through all that.
aspergers,fpv6y3l,t3_gfkskz,1588936986.0,Can totally relate. Used to drive home from work every day like basically calling myself an idiot for everything I said to everyone. People like me! Yet still I tortured myself over everything. It's just one of those things.
