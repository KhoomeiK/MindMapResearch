collapse,fqxat98,t1_fqv07n3,1589729123.0,"Absolutely. Ive been saying before he was even elected: putting him in the White House is dangerous because he will at least attempt to cheat the election or simply not leave if he loses. 

Im highly confident about this because he cheated flagrantly last time and is feeling more empowered now that he is actually president. Never give a narcissist so much power... smh."
collapse,fqxa6at,t1_fqv976t,1589728836.0,"Big time Carter fan. Glad to hear this anecdote as a younger redditor. 

My theory: he is the nicest guy to be president in the last 100 years at least. Just salt of the earth, good human from what Ive seen. At least compared to most other presidents."

nfl,fpxymcu,t1_fpxv3k9,1588992273.0,"Yep, I agree on both fronts. 

Best of luck to you all. I really love Burrow as an Ohio kid myself so you guys are now reinforced as the only other divisional team I don‚Äôt hate with burning passion."
nfl,fpxu50n,t1_fpxs84s,1588989621.0,"Yeah I think the Bengals will do pretty well for what expectations are. Burrow is super legit. My guess is 5-7 wins but improvement over the following years depending on how good of a coach Taylor is. 

It will definitely be interesting. I think Pittsburgh has one last hoorah in them and Baltimore is gonna be incredible again but i dont see them at 14 wins. I will guess the records and how everyone will finish. 

1. Ravens 12-4
2. Steelers 10-6
3. Browns 7-9
4. Bengals 6-10"
nfl,fpxpstt,t1_fpxpogx,1588987135.0,Should be. But the org is a dumpster fire and Stefanski is unproven. If we got a coach with some experience 7-9 would be my floor

nfl,fpxlhvd,t1_fpxl1sm,1588984831.0,Thats fair. Im calling us at 7 wins (would have been 8 or 9 if pandemic wasnt happening as i think new coaches are behind the 8 ball with it).

nfl,fpwijw8,t1_fpvtegm,1588964070.0,"Jackson is the key. He is what puts the Ravens as #1 rushing attack by far. Even if he gradually runs less, until he is no longer even a threat to do it, he still elevates the shit out of that backfield."
