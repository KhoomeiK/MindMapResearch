No point in pitching a fight over it which is why I'm here. Insulted but not particularly pushing a confrontation with the person about it, at least nothing beyond mentioning that it's an insult. However the term is still an insult to us and that's why I'm bothered by it. 

Is it really not used as a cudgel however? If it wasn't meant to be used as a cudgel then why use an ugly word at all? It's like using the insulting version of the n word. Without aiming at anyone. (Of course I'm not gonna say Jap caries as much weight as that particular insult.) However, needless to say whoever is African American and is in the vicinity would have a problem with it. We might not say it, just to keep the day going, however there is a loss of mutual respect. That generally means that whoever said it looks down upon a certain race or has a bias against them. And I consider Jap to be a lighter loss of mutual respect.

Edit: Just gonna add this on. Because no matter who you talk to. I don't think it's right if you say the n word to refer to the people in africa. It ain't right to refer to the people in Europe with a derogatory slur, even if it's not directly meant to insult them. That's why I'm insulted even if I'm not particularly part of the conversation, even though if it's a discord channel whoever it part of said channel they're part of the conversation technically."

And if guys can't become Justin Bieber, than the only other option is to degrade him... in mass. (doesn't justify anything but that's probably why we do it.)

Also doesn't help that 90% of the time people around that age have a pact mentality? So like ie, if the cool kid doesn't like Just Bieber, the people around him try to be cool by HATING Justin Bieber. Than it keeps going around till, everyone hates Justin Bieber, despite never having heard his music? (And if you don't hate it you're considered girly.)

As for guys? Two things that guys can and have been humiliated for are anime and games. If a girl likes anime and games she's respected. Unless it's from other gamer guys, most people will dislike guys for playing games and watching anime. Doesn't matter what game or what anime it is, if you say you watch anime you get bad rep. Also if guys do anything that's not the norm, we get tons of bad rep from other guys. Ie. Cheerleading, knitting, weaving, journaling (at least around highschool.). Although this is more of a feminism issue probably. As a guy if you don't like sports and cars it's a problem to guys that do. We fear being tagged as gay, at least when I was in school.

So while I generally do think, teenage girls will get hated on for liking some band like One Direction or Justin Bieber, and honestly they get a lot more hate than us guys. Guys kinda HAVE to hate what girls like at that age or we get ostracized lol. If we don't follow the status quo, it's a huge problem. At least at that age.

Quality wireless headphones can get pretty pricey. (Wireless over/on ear Bose Headphones start at 350). You can't even get some of the headphones wireless, ie v-modas have a completely different line of headphones for on over/on ear wireless. While yeah there are convertors, for the most part it seems like the sound quality drops when you use convertors.  The whole Sound monitor type headphones for us audiophiles generally don't seem to come wireless without some handicraft modding. Generally for the same price you can spend the money getting better wired headphones. (350$ for vmoda crossfades. 350$ for wired m-200 vmoda.)

Doesn't help that if you forget to charge them, they die. If you forget them, you can't just get 10 dollar headphones and use that as a temporary solution. Some of the cheaper lower quality on ears are absolute garbage. I've broken the frames, and I've killed batteries. In NYC, I remember I couldn't even get them to work without tons of static on some of them.

In general most of the world, I'd imagine, still uses wired headphones, why not just give us an option like every other frickin phone in the last 20 years has? It certainly seems to work better.

If you want industrial metal, which is like metal and techno fused into one:

You've got Rammstein, a really good German band. I'd recommend the songs, Sonne, Du Hast, Keine Lust. Korn and Skrillex made Shut the Fuck up, Get up. Prince by BassNectar. Korn also did Narcistic Cannibal. 

A personal favorite band of mine from that genre is Nothing More, which ranges from very heavy rock songs to something softer. Their most popular song is, This is the time. Personally I like, Don't stop, which the rapper from Papa Roach raps in. Jenny is a bit softer.

CRX is pretty good, their best songs are probably Broken Bones, Walls, Unnatural. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Indie rock bands? You might enjoy Two Door Cinema Club. Their known for the songs: What you know, Undercover Martyn, Are we Ready? 

RatBoy Scum is a really indie band, but they're a modern rock band that sounds like they're an 80s European band. I personally was introduced to them by the song, Laidback. Scum is another good song by them.

Neon Trees. Indie band, mostly known for the hit song Animal? 

Animal, Moving in the Dark, 

&#x200B;

Weird hard Niche bands?

Oh boi if you're down here, good luck, this is where things are on that line that's so weird you can't enjoy it. Or you will really just have fun with it.

Postmodern Jukebox. A group that does  Jazz version of lots of songs. If you listen to the GNR in Fallout 3, or don't mind those kinds of songs. You will enjoy some of these covers.

[Mr.Blue](https://Mr.Blue) Sky. Creep. Dream On. 

&#x200B;

Alestorm. Pirate metal... Nothing else needs to be said. If you enjoy something like orchestral power metal, you might enjoy this? Their songs are either about, old tales, partying and or drinking, or problems about being a pirate, I.E Shipwrecked.

Songs: Shipwrecked.  Drink. Huntmaster. Leviathan. 

Igorrr. Igorrr's one of those bands you're not sure what genre to call it. Sometimes metal, sometimes a lot more techno-y? Lots and lots of actual screaming, that's not screamo. And plenty of unusual instruments. People call him between genius and insane. Also a nonsensical language?

Japanese rock bands: 

Some of the Japanese rock bands are good. If you don't mind the change in language, some of them are really good. And I will try to avoid throwing the ones, that do ONLY Anime songs. 

B'z. Good rock band , they're fairly famous in Japan. If you've seen the original trailer for Dragon's Dogma, they made the song for that trailer.

Ultra Soul.

X-Japan. They're the Kiss of Japan really. They're an old band though. 

Rusty Nail, Standing Sex, Kurenai.

Miyavi. One of Japan's best guitarests... That doesn't play guitar as much as he should?

Flashback. What's my Name? Havana (Cover, it's a solid cover.)

(I wish I could recommend more, but most decent rockbands ends up getting kidnapped by the anime industry to make anime openings LOL)

Vocaloid covers. Vocaloids, the basic explanation is that, you have someone record a person saying multiple syllables. A musician will string the syllables and pitch them and tone them to make them sound like a singing person. The covers usually always end up a lot better. Once again another mostly Japanese only thing, there are English covers...But they're super lackluster mostly.

Ghost Rule by Soraru. Roki by miku. God Slaying Machine by Miku. 

Anything by the musician Neru: (He has a string of hits in Japan.)

Lost One's Weeping mafu. Law Evading rock. (Prepare for the wierdest video you've ever seen.) Abstract Nonsense by Amatsuki."

The more days go by the more I just miss him. I miss just hugging him. Neither of us said much, but that was fine, because we were just their for each other when we did need to say something. Now we talk everyday about nothing because that feels like the only way to stay in touch. I just loved the quiet we could have together.

And sometimes it drives me nuts because there's just not much to talk about. But I feel I have to or else I'll lose him. And because I know what it's like to have anxiety, and I know he probably has it worse than I do. I want to make sure he knows I have him on mind, because I know that when you have to be the person to send the first message it makes you self doubt yourself.

And the pauses and sometimes the time it takes to respond. I know I'm just being sensitive but sometimes when he doesn't respond after a bit, short time like 30 minutes, I feel hurt. I get worried because soon after we got into a relationship the whole quarantine thing happened  and we didn't spend much time together before it. I can't put my full faith in him because I just haven't known him long enough. 

Yeah I know he loves me, and I know there's nothing he would gain from just throwing me out now. And he gave me a solid reason for why he wants to stay with me. 

But I get scared.

It hurts when he seems to have a lot more fun talking to his friends in the discord group. I know it's because they're all HUGE fans of animal crossing, and I'm just not into it. You give me a hard game like Celeste and I'll enjoy it, but a grindy game where there's just not much going on, just bores me. I tried to like it, I truly did. But after a while it felt more like a chore, to get up everyday go in. Shake trees for things and dig up stuff. I just couldn't take it anymore and quit. 

It's bad because I wake up thinking about him and fall asleep thinking about him. I think about him a lot especially with all this time we have. I count the days we have till we hit June because I'm hoping that by then things will die down a little. But I know that's probably not true but it's like the slightest glimmer of hope I have to hang onto at the moment."
Advice,fo4sx1d,t3_g5osdc,1587510582.0,"If you don't mind something that's from over seas. The Redmi k20 pro is pretty good. It's fairly fast decent specs from what I remember. The UI is a bit weak though admittedly. Has a pretty solid camera with good resolution. And I haven't had any battery trouble and haven't been in a situation where my phone was gonna die without a charger and I've had it since December so far. (Then again I came from a samsung note 5 where the battery couldn't last 5-6 hours with constant use.)  And I think it's under 500, pretty sure it was closer to 400 when I bought it? It does come with bloatware, though if you get an app you can get rid of that pretty easily. 

If you care, it's a full screen phone, there's no physical buttons except he power and volume buttons. The front camera is hidden. It pops up when you go to use it. Thus far, I have seen a couple test for people trying to break it? The camera works pretty well and doesn't break from what I see? 

Though HARD warning. It doesn't work with every cellphone provider in the USA, since it's originally form China, it only works with certain networks. However personally I'm in an area where it happens to work and since I don't travel far anyway it doesn't bother me. I'll leave it to you to do the research since I don't remember much about it. Because it's also overseas it does seem to have trouble with a couple random things? Like for an example, it can make calls on the discord app, but if you use your headphones mic's, the mic won't work? Small things like that so far."

My  boyfriend suffers from depression. And this whole quarantine seems to  have hit him pretty hard. I've spent a few days trying to figure out  what I can do for him, ever since he talked about it a little and  mentioned it was getting worse. At first I didn't even really realize  how hard he was taking it. Until he brought it up the second time. I  just didn't realize that it was affecting him that much, since my  friends are either the type to say they're depressed but not really mean  it? (Like use depressed and bummed out, or tired interchangeably, type?  And I know someone who has a severe depression issues, like they have  trouble getting out of bed because of depression.)

I  started thinking about what I can do for him. And I kinda slowly  started to realize I can't do much for him. I can say I love him and  that I miss him. And tell him he's important to me, but at the end of  the day that doesn't help I feel like. He's stuck at home with his  father that he doesn't really get along with. And he wants out. He's  lucky that his friend is staying with him. But the isolation is still  getting to him. I feel like I can't do much for him.  
I also blame  myself for not, thinking about trying to do something for him earlier,  when he first mentioned it. I wasn't thinking about it honestly. I don't  know why. I should've been thinking about it a bit more seriously the  first time he mentioned it, but for some reason it just kinda went right  by me. I blame myself even more because, In animal crossing he got a  letter from one of the NPCs that made his day and made a tweet about it.  While yeah I admit it's petty, I'm extra upset at myself because even  an NPC can do better than I can. I have to step up my game if I want to  keep him happy and I don't know what to do honestly."
Advice,fntxjs0,t3_g3sf14,1587250515.0,"It's probably best to know that a lot of the time when people don't answer and it's usually after a few hours. 9/10 it's usually because they're busy doing something or in the middle of something.

Among my guy friends, we go days, and some weeks, without texting each other because we're caught up with life. If anything he's probably thinking the same way you're thinking now XDD Don't assume things what people are thinking because that's gonna make you worry about a problem that might be non existent.

If you just tell someone how you feel it makes your life easier, and his too. You're interested in him? Tell him you are and see where it goes. If he doesn't reciprocate your feelings move on.

The problem is that when there are plenty of good looking guys and girls on there. Everyone starts caring less about each person. It's like walking into a library of only Nobel prize winning books, if you pick up the first book you find and it don't interest you after the first page, why would you give it a chance when the next book could interest you?

But here's my advice:

Avoid long messages. Unfortunately 9 times  out of 10 most people are really put off by long messages. If it's more than a paragraph/ Five sentences. Stop right there. I have a tendency to do it. And avoid being Banal about grammar rules. Like, for an example, I know a few people that find it awkward when someone responds with proper punctuation, and grammar and putting a period on every sentence. They think it's too serious like they're reading an official document. So throw in a couple lols, or :P, and loosen up.

Two. Try to strike while the iron is hot. I'd suggest trying to meet up with them, or ask about meeting up by week two. IN PUBLIC NO MATTER WHAT, Date Rapes/murders are a thing please be careful when meeting people at their house. Ask for something casual like a coffee date. After about a month people lose interest.  After following that tip I actually managed to find my boyfriend, so that's probably worth doing. If at first you fail, try a second time. Usually when people put off a date by the second time, and don't try to set one up instead. That's probably a good sign that it's not going anywhere unless they're nervous about date murder/rape.

Three. Try to use a good photo. Even if you're hot or not, if your photo is bad, you will look a lot less appealing. I'm not saying fake things but, don't make yourself look miserable in the photo. My boyfriend told me later that I looked a lot better in real life than I did in my image, and when he saw me, he thought I was someone else. Yeah photos are very important. 

Four. Don't put too much information about yourself in your profile. You want people to ask about you. You don't want to put out so much info that people can't ask anything about you without you telling them to check your profile. 

I'm guessing you're on more than one dating app or site. But I'm just kinda reiterate if you're only trying a couple or something. Each and every dating app attracts different types of people. I find that Tinder has a lot more people that are flirty or have popular jock type people? Okcupid has more laid back people. Hinge, I think it was called, has a bunch of people from like IVY league schools, (I know next door to where I live is Columbia university, but like every third person I saw was from an ivy league school. And then I saw people from Princeton kinda often I think?)  Bumble I saw a bit of everything. I forgot what it was called but the old websites were filled to the brim with bots. I generally recommend dating apps since they seem to have less bots.

Swipe like on everyone. I know this sounds weird but keep this in mind. We're ALL tempted to only swipe like on people that are sexy, handsome e.t.c. e.t.c. But you never know, sometimes someone that's not all that great looking is really cool, sweet, and vibes with you. And ontop of that, you don't end up in situations where apps start hiding who likes you and stuff. Some people suck at writing profiles but shine when you actually talk to them.

And don't be depressing on your profile. Don't do it. Don't say bad things about yourself on your own profile. Don't be critical about yourself on your own profile. Even if your self confidence is bad, you don't want to show it. At worst mention that you're a bit shy maybe. And even that can be a bit of an issue.  

Also don't be afraid to reset your account a couple times. Okcupid has a tendency to, for some reason, NEVER show you who liked you sometimes. I had like 34 likes, on my account and I was so confused why I can't run into them no matter how much I swiped like. If you reset your account you might be able to run into someone that liked you. And sometimes even people that didn't like you, might like you because they're in a different mood.

Ask questions, that require more than yes or no to answer and are very specific. Also ask follow up questions. That usually forces people to talk more, it sounds like you actually care as well. 

Good luck. It took me a while but I was successful with it, and I hope you land a date soon. (Oh god wall of text.)"

(Can't give an exact number since I started left handed months ago, left the game on by accident some nights, have a few accounts in attempt to correct something e.t.c e.t.c.)  
You will get better. It's like any skill, you have to be honest with yourself. You are better than you were the day before. And most of the time it's not by much, but everyday that you pick up that guitar, you will be better! And after a couple months when you look back you'll realize you've grown.   
 I find that the best way to improve, is just charging into hard songs that you can barely play, like 50%-70% completion let's say. Something that will really push you, but you won't be so overwhelmed with crazy chords that you can't even hit a thing. Because some of the easier songs won't teach you much, (Like playing Numb from Linkin Park isn't gonna do you much good.)   
 IF you want to  play without looking. Do exactly that. Don't look and try to feel around until you must look. Don't be afraid to fail, and don't be discouraged when they give you a bad score. Because the point is to learn. 

 Good luck! (And other people please correct me if I'm wrong sine I'm a newb and I might be giving bad advice too x.x ) Even now I have trouble with the third and fourth string.  And playing anything below the 12th fret but trust me, the longer you play the more you'll get used to it."

I had a friend that stole money from their parent to open loot boxes. I have a friend that spends money buying games over food (And he does this often enough that he laughs about not having finished the previous games he's purchased despite enjoying them.) There are people that spend for their enjoyment.
 I don't know why you think it's worth noting that there are exceptions, when the OP is specifically targeting people that spend, just to spend.
