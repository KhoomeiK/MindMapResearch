Would Seachem Alkaline Buffer, or Seachem Equilibrium be an option at combating an active soil or would that just be unnecessary work?

Would using one of the active aquarium soils lower the pH to the point of being detrimental to any snails in the tank?

Could I potentially cap one of the aquasoils with eco complete, would that prevent the aquasoil from lowering the pH while still providing root minerals? Or is that just a Walstad method thing?"

I do have hard water but my pH has dropped to 6.5-ish, because of my substrate (but I am changing it to eco complete soon). I put a bit of a ""Turtle Conditioner"" block in there that my roommate had (Petsmart said it would work for snail shells and shrimp??). I'm gonna pick up a cuttlebone and leave that in there eventually I think. I also blanched some spinach and placed that in the tank for them to much on as I heard it has some calcium. I also was gonna look into 'Snail Jello'. I feel like I had kids unexpectedly lol, frantically searching the internet for tips.

My mom knows my struggles with depression and I know she's terrified I'll go that far one day. But I never will, because I wouldn't just be killing myself, I'd be killing her too. 

I'm going to spend the rest of my days getting as healthy as I can for her, I'm scared for the day she passes away because if I'm not better by then maybe there'll be nothing stopping me. 

I hate thinking like this but it helps sometimes, she's my rock.

Not sure what treatment you are seeking but there's something out there for everyone. Having peers who know what you're going through is a life saver (literally). I always think of the movie 'It's Kind of a Funny Story', finding those people who have had similar experiences and making it work. Having people you can really spill your guts to is so healing. It's stupid to say but it really is about the little things. 

Wishing you the best xx"
