BipolarReddit,f95eigt,t1_f95aw9h,1575126082.0,"I love this page with everyone’s encouragement and support, it’s so hard because I don’t know anybody with this condition and it’s hard to confide in people"
BipolarReddit,f95ed9z,t1_f95abhr,1575125994.0,There are therapists and there is a waiting list that is months out. If you don’t sign up at the very beginning of the semester you’re screwed. My roommate went and they turned her away
