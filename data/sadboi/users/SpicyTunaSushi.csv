A humanist celebrant will be hired as I am an atheist as is most of my immediate family, so having a priest talking about Jesus would simply make no sense in this context (especially with highway to hell playing in the background). I'd ask that anyone who does a eulogy be honest and not talk about how great I was, but rather the confusing texts I would send out at 3 in the morning while half asleep but at the same time hyped up on caffeine. Instead of saying ""sorry for your loss"" when approaching any close friends or family of mine, I instead ask that you tell a bad joke. This is only partially a joke. I genuinely want to be remembered by the way I lived, not by how i died.

AskReddit,fkixkeq,t3_fikjbd,1584231024.0,"Don’t know if this is the kind of response you were looking for, but sertraline. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 9 and thrown onto a heavy dose of sertraline. One of the side effects of sertraline, especially in young children is depression. Soon after I began taking it, I fell into a deep depression. I had suicidal thoughts for years and couldn’t build up the courage to tell my parents or doctors. When I was 12 I tried to kill myself. I was really close but couldn’t do it. I started self-harming instead. After a while I went off my meds and my anxiety got worse but the suicidal thoughts lessened. My parents found out I was off my meds and asked me why. I lied and said that they gave me panic attacks so my doctor switched me over to another medication. I’m much better now and a much happier person and going off my meds ended up being a good decision, but I absolutely do not recommend it in any other situation."
