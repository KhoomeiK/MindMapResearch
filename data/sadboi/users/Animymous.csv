bisexual,fjs5so0,t3_fev44z,1583593999.0,"You might find that as you gain more sexual/romantic experience and meet more people that your desires change too. It definitely did for me. I lost my virginity relatively late compared with my peers and it was only once I became more 'sexual' that I realised the extent of my attraction to both men and women. Or you could just be only rarely or emotionally attracted to women and that's all fine - at the end of the day just follow your gut feelings. It's nice to identify with a label but try not to get too tied up with labelling yourself! Bisexuality is a whole realm of possibilities and there's no right or wrong place to be on the spectrum.

Also it might be worth asking yourself if you're genuinely turned off by imagining sex with women or if it's some deeply buried internalised homophobia making you feel like it's taboo or 'wrong' - or even a discomfort in imagining close female friends in a sexual way, which I know I definitely have experienced before."
bisexual,fd5gurq,t3_ejzxyv,1578177490.0,"You described my experience exactly haha.

First girl crush out of absolutely nowhere at the age of 22, even after three years of university. Though if I think hard about it, I definitely did have a girl crush around the age of 14 that I probably repressed because I also liked guys and bi-erasure is real, even internally."

bisexual,fb4l6po,t1_fb4e471,1576511015.0,"I know don't worry, it was only a bit of fun and advise other people to consider it the same way. If you think you're bi it obviously doesn't matter what % of each you like"
bisexual,fb2224c,t1_fb206mp,1576444363.0,"185.7% sexual, nice, can anybody top that I wonder"
bisexual,fb21y2g,t1_fb1vo3s,1576444320.0,Oh yeah I totally agree. It actually quite nicely summed up my current position on the spectrum but I wouldn't take it too much to heart.
bisexual,fb1qkow,t3_eaqj3y,1576439814.0,"I'm the same and the main reason why I didn't think I could be bi for ages was that I couldn't ever see myself with a 'butch' woman, and I thought cutting my hair short was the only way to date other women (which I never wanted to do)"
bisexual,fb1j08c,t3_eb2j60,1576437487.0,I just bought one of these from Etsy hoping to make myself more obvious to bi/gay girls :P I considered a bi beanie hat as well but thought it might be too much...
bisexual,fb1hm8x,t1_fb1h02d,1576437072.0,Thanks! :D

""i’m entitled to these things because i deserve them. i deserve to be treated like the greatest thing that has ever walked this earth because that’s how a queen is supposed to be treated. yes i want nice things, that’s because i deserve them and you either just don’t see it that way or just don’t care and i just want! more!

If it is real, then fuck OP, run far away from this girl and don't stop running."
