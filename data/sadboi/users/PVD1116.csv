badtattoos,ey56b3j,t1_ey54ld8,1566823176.0,He actually got the spelling correct.  It is Leia.
badtattoos,ey566at,t1_ey3hp4b,1566823057.0,To be honest I‚Äôm amazed the artist has been tattooing for that long considering that the city I live in has a completely legit tattoo culture and a ton of excellent shops.  All of the reviews on her business website are from people that just got their first tattoo.  They rave about the work.  Poor saps.
badtattoos,ey1penb,t1_ey1p8i6,1566706498.0,Lmao yes.  This artist literally has been tattooing for 13 years and actually owns a shop.  They don‚Äôt have any flash and they only do ‚Äúcustom tattoos.‚ÄùüôÑ
bipolar,exhaa1o,t3_csshzn,1566298642.0,This is the truth.  I know I need help but I can‚Äôt afford it.

bipolar,exgyb78,t3_csmflk,1566281188.0,Lol.  I had my heart ripped out of my chest and I‚Äôll never love again...then I get tattooed and fall in love with the artist.  She leaves her husband for me and then we explode 7 months later.  (She is borderline).  Dating with mental illness....at least it‚Äôs never boring.
bipolar,ewu0o5p,t3_cq3zz9,1565759858.0,I have moments where I feel nothing and moments when I feel everything.  Sometimes I feel nothing and everything all at once if that makes sense.  I have a hard time differentiating between real and fake emotion.  For instance I have told a girlfriend that I loved them but wasn‚Äôt sure if I truly did or not.  It was difficult to tell.  I feel things intensely but then also have an inherent lack of empathy.  It‚Äôs complicated but you aren‚Äôt alone.

That child will be in state care within a couple of years.  She created a monster from her own laziness and apathy.  That child was robbed of a proper upbringing that would prepare him for life.  Sorry, end of rant."
PublicFreakout,ewep7io,t3_cns6wu,1565331904.0,We need more newscasts like this.  At least I feel like I can trust her.  For real.  No spin there just the faks.
BipolarReddit,ewecous,t1_ewea70t,1565320242.0,I agree with rage and hypomania.  My last two relationships ended in a hypomanic rage (combined with alcohol).  I ended up destroying and dehumanizing myself as much as my words did to my former lovers.  I regret the way those situations ended everyday.  I ended up saying horrible thing to my ex with Borderline Personality Disorder and I can‚Äôt forgive myself for it now.  I regret it everyday.  Try to keep a cool head and talk calmly to your bf when things have cooled down and passed.
bipolar,ewafjz9,t3_cnfesd,1565242661.0,BP2 is classified as major depression with bouts of hypomania.  Full blown manic episodes are rare.  Supposedly even one major manic episode results in a BP1 diagnosis but I think in reality it‚Äôs a spectrum.  The burden of BP1 is the same as BP2.  The type of mood changes are just different.

bipolar,ew1ep1q,t3_cma7am,1565021800.0,I lost 100 pounds in 6 months when I was mostly hypomanic.  One of the symptoms/side affect of this illness is rapid weight fluctuations.
worldnews,ew1e6ct,t1_ew1dio9,1565021466.0,I just did some snooping on the internet because 2 days seems awfully soon.  The real timeline of a heartbeat is actually 21-22 days after conception.  That is a large difference.  Also this cluster of cells with no heartbeat for three weeks is as sovereign as the adult female body that it‚Äôs growing in?
worldnews,ew188qo,t1_ew180ji,1565017524.0,You are welcome to your opinion.  I‚Äôm welcome to mine.  There is no harm in open dialogue.  Elaborate on your point please.
worldnews,ew16j8l,t1_ew14o5j,1565016351.0,Don‚Äôt have sex...I suppose that‚Äôs a realistic expectation for every bible thumping man on here talking about women‚Äôs reproductive rights.  For the record I am a man as well.  By the way it‚Äôs no coincidence that the states in America where there is a push to reverse time and make abortions illegal are also the states with the lowest rated education systems.   Shocker.

bipolar,evslnkd,t3_cl2dz7,1564750200.0,Sounds about right.  7 to 8 months is the average shelf life for a relationship in my 30s because of my BP2.  It sucks balls.
bipolar,evdhx66,t1_evcoxst,1564438657.0,     Thanks for that viewpoint.  I appreciate your thoughtful response.  I‚Äôm have a hard time picturing the future.  I‚Äôm not balanced and was diagnosed with BPII.  This depression marked by periods of hypomanic impulse and self destructive behavior have really taken a lot from me.  I‚Äôm not trying to be overwhelmingly negative but sometimes it is relieving to know that this isn‚Äôt forever.  It has an end.
bipolar,evcknvv,t1_evci9sj,1564417380.0,It‚Äôs so tough to open up though.  I‚Äôm still not there with my therapist yet.

bipolar,ev4g55j,t3_cidfpo,1564213306.0,Stay away.  I have BP2 and have used cocaine occasionally.  It‚Äôs always a terrible idea.  The crash afterwards plunges me into a deep depression for days.
bipolar,ev4efzo,t3_cie6xe,1564212484.0,Sounds about right to be honest.  Instead of waiting for a truck I travel the world alone waiting to vanish.

bipolar,eud0us7,t3_cfinpw,1563695372.0,    The true blessing and curse is when both partners are hypersexual and live together.  This is my ex gf and I.  We could never stop and it spiraled and spiraled into this super unhealthy pattern of hedonism.  The hypomania of one of us could spark and influence the hypomania of the other.  It was extremely unhealthy and I had to let her walk.  I was weak and we became partners again 6 months later but that door is finally closed for good.  That being said...the sex was spectacular and intense and powerful but too much can really warp your realities and what you prioritize in life.

bipolar,etw4lev,t3_cdsf6m,1563253773.0,This happens all of the time including relationships...I was way more in love with an ex than she was with me.  It was painful.
bipolar,ett32zg,t3_cdb3gw,1563163001.0,I have been there.  I‚Äôm glad you are ok.  Dark thoughts wash over you quickly but hang in there and they usually pass almost as quick.
bipolar,ett1op0,t3_cdbeqc,1563161768.0,     I struggle with dating and I feel that I‚Äôm truly going to just be alone for the rest of my life.  The only women I have dated in my 30‚Äôs have also had mental illness.  BP1 and Borderline Personality Disorder.  It was silly to think that those relationships would ever work but I feel that I need someone with a mental illness in order to be understand and tolerate my own issues.  The biggest issues in those relationships was my hypomania sparking hypomania in my partner and vice versa.  We had lots of great sex but in the end we‚Äôre just using it for escapism and it wasn‚Äôt healthy.  It certainly wasn‚Äôt enough to maintain a ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship either.  So after those experiences I‚Äôve decided to isolate myself and take a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from dating.  It‚Äôs lonely and it sucks but it‚Äôs a fact of the illness.
bipolar,ett0l5z,t3_cd20q7,1563160826.0,     I cleaned my apartment today for a couple of hours.  As a BP2 diagnosed male living alone for a year after a painful breakup...it definitely needed it.  There is still much more to do but I used what energy I had after work to do something positive rather than going right to sleep or staring at the ceiling.
AskReddit,etoweks,t3_ccnh9u,1563039338.0,     My father dying in front of me when I was 16.  I knew it was going to happen but was still not prepared.  A lot of my emotions and some of my mental health died with him.  It‚Äôs had a significant impact on all of my relationships and how open or guarded I am with most people.  Not a good time.
bipolar,etngp6c,t1_etnd5zu,1562986706.0,Yeah it‚Äôs rough.  Things like this only bother me when my depression is at an all time low.  Then I‚Äôll rationalize it all away next time I‚Äôm up...then it will be there waiting for me once more the next time around.  Even worse than before.  As I‚Äôm getting older the lack of Identity is very troubling.  I‚Äôm 35M and I see everyone around me with their so called shit together and I‚Äôm a train wreck that doesn‚Äôt even know who I am.
