ToxicRelationships,fh8sczh,t1_fh3btsg,1581366378.0,"CW: physical violence threats  


Sorry for the long comment. I just feel like I'm commiserating with people who get it.

I really like both of these comments. I feel like I'm in the same place. I know I have toxic patterns: jealousy, trust issues, and constant anxiety. I know it's a lot to deal with, especially because I let it get in the way of meaningful physical intimacy and trust building. All that said: I'm just not sure how to deal with the outbursts anymore. I understand my boyfriend gets frustrated and I know why he does. But I deal with torrents of really nasty insults and recently it's starting towards trending towards physically violent--or at least threatening physical violence. I feel like I can't move past the trust issues, which are largely from my own paranoia, because the fights between us are escalating. I'm becoming much more recalcitrant, quiet, and sad all the time. I'm depressed. I want it to work, but every night I'm worrying about disappointing him in some way and getting a rage out. Or being stonewalled. And it's making the barriers worse and worse to get over.  


This person has done so much for me and really helped me through some hard times. I've taxed a lot of his energy, and I'm trying to figure out if I just need to let go because this relationship is so toxic. I love him deeply, but I don't know if we can heal--I don't talk with my therapist about this relationship at all, and just say things are fine (but I'm ""a lot of work""). So it feels like there's no end in sight to the rapidly rising anger and rage, let alone my own satisfaction in a ""normal"" ""healthy"" relationship.  


I wish everybody struggling with this sort of thing luck. It's so hard when you've been shitty, but it just keeps building, and you can't stop it or slow down the other person's anger."

Honestly, while it may have been best for my wellbeing at the time, it made me hugely distrust medication. It took me 10 years to trust medication and get on an appropriate meds plan (which has been great for me)."

DeadBedrooms,er479fr,t3_c06n3e,1560482886.0,Deeply empathize. He's a piece of shit. You shouldn't feel stable based on his (supposed) fidelity to you. That's some rank ass shit and he's emotionally abusing you.
