SuicideWatch,fnyirdr,t3_g4nfjb,1587364366.0,"update. it’s gotten worse. i’m begging you, anyone, please, give me what i deserve. i’m desperate just please someone get me out of this shit hole of a fucking life"
depression,fmvivmm,t1_fmvitmm,1586418576.0,of course. thank you op ❤️
depression,fmvic65,t1_fmvi89w,1586418021.0,"the thing is is that i’ve never smoked. this is my first time as just a “taste test” if you will.

i’m just freaking out over the fact that it’s weed and i’ve always thought of it as some illegal and harmful thing when in reality i know full well that it isn’t and it does have its benefits"
depression,fmvi15j,t1_fmvhsbi,1586417710.0,yes. and i live in a state where it’s legalized. but that only proves my point that i’m just being a baby about this m
depression,fmvhpw8,t1_fmvhjew,1586417387.0,"i know i’m overreacting. i assume it’s a subconscious reaction because anything that you ingest or inhale like weed or alcohol is against the law.

it’s probably from bad experiences."
depression,fmu2aga,t3_fx3oz6,1586383240.0,"on my end, it either stays as bad as it is or it spikes into a massive drop.
they’re never telling the truth. it’s always an attempt to make that person feel better. what a load of bull..."
SuicideWatch,fmhg9cj,t1_fmhfm5q,1586078883.0,"thank you for the kind words. i guess the cabin fever is really getting to me.

honestly compliments really don’t effect me anymore but i really do appreciate them.

and about therapists, i do have some. i haven’t been able to see any of them because of the quarantine but i mean it’s whatever."
Persona5,floivik,t1_flohz97,1585339150.0,"I hope so. If that’s the case, then hopefully I shouldn’t have anything to worry about. But we won’t know until the 31st."
depression,fl7el9v,t3_fn1vc8,1584900137.0,"not very well to be honest. i hate staying at home 24/7 and not being able to go to school or the store, i feel like a lazy slob and useless hunk of flesh and that doesn’t help with my non existent self-esteem. i’ve always felt like this on weekends even before the national quarantine and it’s only amplified because of this. 

i’m still kicking somehow, it hasn’t been fun. it’s going to be a LONG 2-3 weeks...."
depression,fl5b2bb,t1_fl5a6mf,1584832586.0,"if i had it i would, i don’t know what we should do."
depression,fl57hqt,t3_fmi67k,1584830248.0,"i really hope you’re okay OP, god please PLEASE be okay."
depression,fl02h51,t1_fl02fc6,1584688829.0,"it definitely is. but there are some nights where i feel completely fine after a call, but most of the time i feel like breaking down and crying. it’s strange really"
SuicideWatch,fl02abk,t3_flkjzw,1584688616.0,"the main thing to note is that what happened wasn’t your fault. you were forced and taken advantage of because you were drunk. i don’t really know how to help myself since i’ve never been in your situation but that’s the main point you need to remember op.

and in other words, screw that guy that called you gay because you’re a guy that got r*ped by other men, he should stop talking to you"
depression,fkmdj9r,t1_fkmdh8q,1584326413.0,Thank you :) I’ll bring it up to my therapist if I can.
depression,fkmcxg8,t1_fkmcmua,1584326010.0,"That’s most likely the case. I don’t really notice when it happens. But I do get really scared to say certain things in fear of ruining someone’s day, so when that does happen I constantly degrade and yell at myself for being stupid and not realizing what I said was a terrible thing to say."
depression,fkm98j2,t1_fkm8yf9,1584323673.0,"I don’t really know myself. I’ve never seen myself in a good light in a really long time, I’ve always felt like a waste of time and money to my parents and therapists, you can say I’ve always felt like a “lost cause.” Maybe I’m just trying to find justification for my misfortunes. Not because they were simple mistakes but because I was the reason they happened at all, if I wasn’t there it wouldn’t have happened."
depression,fkm8f1q,t1_fkm84jl,1584323193.0,"Mainly just friendship issues. Mostly from one because we have a past short lived love life that was cut short because I felt uncomfortable. We still worry and care about each other but I always felt like whatever I said just ruined his mood to the point where I didn’t even want to vent to anyone for a couple of weeks, probably close to a month. That and I recently felt unwelcome in the group chat I share with him and two others, I felt like “They would be so much happier if I just left.” I’ve left a couple of times before and it felt nice. I felt like I finally did something right for once in my life."
SuicideWatch,fkm6xsg,t3_f9d5go,1584322321.0,"That’s pretty much how it is for me. Mainly because I fear severe pain and a gun isn’t a good way to go out cause it’s a fucking gun pointed straight at me. That whole idea is fucking terrifying. I just wish I didn’t exist in the first place, not I wish I could just die already, if I didn’t exist I wouldn’t have to die via suicide."
depression,fkm5kq1,t3_fj15uq,1584321521.0,"I know a lot of people care about me but it sometimes feels like they’re empty words. I don’t feel like they ACTUALLY care about me. It’s like they say, even you can feel lonely in a crowd."
depression,fkgqq8y,t1_fkgqoka,1584169836.0,Thank you for the invitation but I’ll be fine. This might just all be built up emotions but who knows.
depression,fkgqlm5,t1_fkgqkp6,1584169667.0,Thank you for the support ^^
depression,fkgqff8,t1_fkgq42i,1584169450.0,I’m glad someone has had moments like me. I’m not diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder but it nice to know that others deal with this. And yeah it is mostly at night. I always say that when I’m tired my brains line of defenses against my depression is lowered so I’m a lot more sensitive at night.
deadmalls,fgo7jhe,t3_ezl1ra,1580961718.0,these are the kind of photos i absolutely adore with dead malls. i’m a sucker for eerily quiet and darkish scenes in a mall. awesome work!
deadmalls,fg6rvk1,t3_esm353,1580575455.0,"i just love the vibes that dead malls give me. every time i see a picture of an empty area in a mall i can just imagine myself standing in that very place and just listening to the music quietly echo throughout the silent building. a once booming place for teens and adults is now abandoned and left to rot...

....or i just have a strange taste in aesthetics. who knows"

Instagram,eqrcfx4,t1_eqr9quj,1560256902.0,"i know these are all porn bots, obviously, i’ve taken the necessary actions to stop this. this article is basically saying how it works and they should encourage it. i was just wondering if anyone was dealing with the same issue i had last night because it seemed odd to me that 30-40 of just random porn bots would view my story in just a day, and have them looking at my story while i was talking about it. thank you for the help"
