Words probably can't reach the depths of what you're feeling, but if you go up to a sibling, SO, parent, a friend, anybody you have a decently close connection to and tell them that you aren't ok, you're contemplating suicide, and you need help, that should get them to realise that you are in lots of pain. From my own experience, sharing your sadness with others, even if all they say is ""mhmm, yep, ok, ooooh..."" just getting it off of your chest helps alleviate some of the frustrations you might have with yourself."
