EatingDisorders,fqaundi,t3_ggz3d8,1589225575.0,"Perhaps try psychology based test for eating disorder screening? Or phone a help line for advice? I think you do have symptoms of an eating disorder, but it all comes down to the frequency and severity of your behaviors and the distress they are causing. You could have an eating disorder or disordered eating (yes, they are different things). Do some research from credible sites or reach out to medical professionals. No one can diagnose you here, we can only help to a certain extent."

EatingDisorders,fpah099,t3_gc2i7i,1588447986.0,"I’m sorry you’re struggling but am glad you want help. My story is sort of similar, my ED began when I was 12, and no one noticed it until I was 15. The thing is, I didn’t want anyone to notice, let alone help. My parents beat themselves up over not being aware, but in reality it was my ED fighting as hard as it could to remain hidden. I’m “recovering” (really functioning and maintaining at a low weight) from anorexia binge/purge subtype. I relate to the need to be “perfect” or beautiful in your profession. For me, I don’t have one yet so it’s ballet, art, and uni that I strive to be as physically appealing as possible, to attain my impossible standards, while also trying to have a great personality to please others. The physical aspect is for myself, the personality more for others. We all want to be appealing, but often our self perceptions and standards are unrealistic. Having horrible self esteem and body dismorphia might mean while you find yourself unappealing, another person might view you very positively, appearance and personality in all.

It’s true, birds of a feather flock together most commonly. However, if your friends are actually friends, that is, they support you and love you no matter what you look like, I wouldn’t be afraid of rejection. Put your health, mental and physical, first. Remember change is uncomfortable. Perhaps let them know your struggle only if you feel comfortable. The internet is great for connecting to like minded people, but what we all need is real human connection. Sending hugs <3"
EatingDisorders,fogm9s9,t3_g6yfbl,1587754392.0,"First of all, you are NOT selfish, for having an ed in the first place, or relapsing now. It’s not your fault because it’s not really your choice. It may seem easy to “blame yourself” because your behaviours are coming from you, but please remember your ed is not you, it’s a mental illness. It’s the devil in your head, not the angel in your heart. Try to separate ed thought and behaviours from you, and trust me, this is hard for I can’t do it most times and it sends me spiraling into a void of self loathing and in turn, ed behaviours.

Why do you think you’re relapsing? Is it the empty time, hoarding/portioning food, instability in life right now, or the stress brought on by everything? Did you want to relapse or do you want to recover? These are things to ask yourself, and even if you said “yes, I did chose to relapse” you did not. It was your ed taking advantage and ultimately taking over. Don’t stop talking to your boyfriend, we all need to talk and be connected at the moment. If you think what your saying is hurting him, it’s because he cares and probably feels helpless. Talk about your problems, but try to talk about coping methods or strategies to combat them too. If not for you, try to fight for him against your ed. You are not your ed. It is the selfish one, not you."
EatingDisorders,fogjsmo,t3_g6ydyf,1587753466.0,"I was thinking you should paint it before you even said that! I think that’s a great idea. Turning a trigger into something beautiful. I myself have been thinking about painting a sunset and/or clouds on my mirror, though I personally won’t fully cover it. Even if parts of it are covered, it could be a distraction from your reflection. Maybe writing with washable marker or putting post it notes that are positive and affirming? Even if you don’t have an ed, people still do that.

I took a shower yesterday and freaked out and body checked for about 15 minutes. I think vanity mirrors are fine (for me) but it’s the full body/wall that gets me. If you have a certain mirror that’s in your view all the time, your room for example, it’s a good idea to put SOMETHING on it. You aren’t a reflection, you a person. Put something on it to make sure you remember that, that you’re more than your body/appearance."
EatingDisorders,fo1e7wj,t3_g4y72t,1587431372.0,"I’ve been IP 5 times, each lasting up to 5 months (approx) in the span of 3 years. I have anorexia b/p subtype, and I was close to death each admission, so I needed a hospital to save my life. That said, it destroyed my life as much as it saved it, but that’s just my traumatic experience with the system. Generally, an IP admission requires you to be both medically and mentally unstable. OP is given when you are medically stable (no longer need daily medical monitoring as you do in IP), and are mentally stable and with behaviours mostly under control. I needed IP because 1) I was dying 2) needed constant monitoring to make sure I was safe and 3) could not control my behaviours at all.

In IP, we were weighed every morning. We stood backwards and didn’t see the number.

And even if you were even slightly underweight, you had to gain. I had to gain a ton, but was discharged each time at a lower weight than the last, just because I was going to kill myself the more weight I gained. They were more concerned about immediate death by suicide than death by my ed it seemed.

Now, I’ve been out of the hospital for the longest ever—since September. I lost weight drastically upon discharge, but has since stabilized. I am in NO means recovered. That’s not what I want if I’m being honest, I just want to be functional and for me that means being at a low weight. There are consequences for this decision. I developed OCD and borderline PD as a result of my weight. I am medically compromised but not needing a hospital. Essentially, I think they gave up on me and let me chose my weight. But generally, you will have to gain to a healthy BMI. I’m just fucked up and not someone to look up to."
EatingDisorders,fo0ddos,t3_g4y61y,1587410922.0,"As you seem to already have an eating disorder, approach weight loss with caution. Yes, you want to be healthy in body weight, but also mentally. If you aren’t in a good headspace right now because you’re surrounded by triggers, I would advise you to be extremely careful with weight loss and have a conscious awareness of your mental state. You don’t want to develop another form of a different eating disorder.

We all want to be comfortable in our bodies, but this wish often turns into an ed through restriction, purging, excessive exercise, etc. You say you are already quite obsessive over calories but binge. Don’t set yourself up to develop another eating disorder.

Try talking to your sister to let her know she’s triggering you. Letting her know this might make her notice her actions and words are damaging. If you don’t have a good or stable relationship with her, this will be hard, but you need to put yourself first and protect yourself. You can only do so much yourself, you need help from others, wether that be your sister monitoring herself to avoid triggering you, or going to therapy or a doctor to begin to tackle your cognitive and physical problems in a healthy way."
EatingDisorders,fntsmpp,t3_g3laic,1587247876.0,"No one can diagnose you here. However, the thoughts and behaviours you mentioned seem to suggest that you may have an eating disorder. My advice is to reach out to a psychiatrist/doctor and have them make a diagnosis of you do indeed have an ed. Noticing that what you’re doing is harmful, but are proud of it is a common characteristic of an ed. It’s good that you’re noticing these things though, and it seems that you want help. So again, reach out to a professional because we can’t do much here."
EatingDisorders,fnsqh5g,t3_g3lakc,1587226850.0,"If you have a good relationship with your parents, I would strongly advise you to tell them. Do not forget that your parents (I’m assuming here) love you. Telling your boyfriend more than just having anxiety around food, would increase your support system. By learning about yourself and your disorder, you will gain insight that will help you with recovery, leading also to help others understand and be able to help you better. I encourage you to do research about eating disorders and recovery, and encourage your boyfriend and parents to do the same if you feel able to. Disclosing such a personal aspect of your life, your eating disorder that is, will seem frightening at first, however, by sharing your struggles, you won’t have to suffer in isolation. A strong support system is very important for eventual recovery. Learn as much as you can about your disorder, what caused it, what prolonged it, and what is causing it to remain in your life, though you are making gains in recovery.

Food wise, set a meal plan, and if possible, meet with a dietitian. This will help you be in control of food, not your eating disorder, and that is a crucial aspect of recovery. Gaining control, but for yourself, not following the behaviours and rituals of your ed, which makes you feel “in control” but it isn’t you, it’s your disorder. It seems like you really want to recover, and distinguishing between your voice and that of the ed will help you with this, as you will learn to follow your own goals and cherish your values, not the deadly goals and values of the ed.

Body and weight wise, though I understand the scale is telling you to eat more for now, it might cause you to relapse when you start to see the number rise. Approach it with extreme caution, as it is often a huge trigger. Being uncomfortable in your body is normal. Underweight, normal weight, or over weight, I think everyone has struggled with their body image and perception at some point. For us, it’s a giant factor of our ed. You said you don’t feel like losing weight is a negative thing, but that is your ed telling you that, it is not you. Don’t follow it down the rabbit hole until you wind up in a hospital or dead, because that’s what the ed wants. Being uncomfortable in your body, especially when gaining weight can seem like torture, but don’t let that feeling drive you to fall deeper into the hole.

Recovery from an eating disorder is more about food and weight. It’s establishing a new identity, learning better coping skills, learning distorted thinking, etc. While you might be able to do this on your own, I encourage you to reach out to a professional, which can be even harder than reaching out to your parents.

Anyways, kinda a rant, but I hope this helps."
EatingDisorders,fnozx39,t3_g2z40o,1587136758.0,"I never admit that I’m hungry. If I say anything, it’s “my stomach hurts.” I’m guilty about my body’s signals, because we’re in total control of our body’s right? Wrong. People have different metabolisms, eating patterns, etc. When your body is sending signals to eat, listen and act. Your boyfriend probably has these body cues too! Just at a different time. When you get hungry, he might not be, and when he’s hungry, you may not be. Listen to your body not comparing yourself to someone who is the opposite. Early birds and night owls are analogous to eating breakfast or skipping it. Just depends on the person.

For me, I’m like you. “My stomach hurts” in the morning so I make myself eat and it helps. I usually go for a walk after, which also helps with the guilt.

In no means am I a medical professional, these are just thoughts I have regarding your concern."
EatingDisorders,fnle2xw,t3_g2c4hz,1587051930.0,"Hi! (pre professional) ballerina here, struggling with and recovering from an eating disorder. The most important thing I can advise is be there for her, physically (as too much isolation can foster more ed behaviours) but in particular, emotionally. Let her know you care deeply about her, and that the love goes beyond her physical appearance and mental disorder. If you really feel you can’t help, encourage her to see a professional, a therapist, doctor, psychiatrist, etc. Avoid talking about dieting, body shape (both yours and hers), workouts, and other potentially triggering topics for someone with an ed. Don’t push her to eat, or not binge/purge (whatever her diagnosis is), that is, don’t be the food police. Ultimately, it’s her choice, and at the end of the day, there’s not much you can do but support her and avoid triggering her."
EatingDisorders,fmwci16,t3_fwjsov,1586444043.0,"you didn’t “choose” to have an ed. You might have chose to use behaviuors such as restriction, binging, purging, excessive exercise, etc, AT FIRST. After these behaviours become engrained and automatic, know that you did not choose this.  The disorder you developed perpetuated and was not intentional at all on your part. Most of us start out with the desire to lose weight, but not to develop an ed, and even if you were a butterfly at first, you probably didn’t see the consequences of the disorder. Once you notice how detrimental an ed is, you might wish you hadn’t engaged in the initial behaviours because now they are the automatic response, again, not a choice but a mental shortcut/pathway. In short, an ed is not a choice or your fault. It’s a perfect storm of compounding factors, many of which are beyond our control. Know that though you can’t choose to have an ed, you can choose recovery."
EatingDisorders,fmw9ozt,t3_fxmcwp,1586442460.0,"the DBT workbooks really helped me. Also the 8 keys to recovery by Gwen Schubert Grabb and Carolyn Costin really helped. They’re both workbooks, which I find extremely helpful as you are engaged in writing and relating the content in the book to your own life, actively working through it. To me, I very much like the “work” of doing the workbooks. It’s really helped with making personal and self made distress tolerance plans, which aren’t some “one size fits all” plan, but rather you can customize it to your problems and needs and they provide many examples to help with this. They teach you to realize and then revise distorted thinking, and notice your relationship with your body and food, among other useful techniques and insights."

The best thing you can do is reach out to one to get help and perhaps a diagnosis, from there you can begin to work on the problems that you are experiencing around food. Again, DON’T wait until you think you’re “sick enough” because you never will be. You’ll always think, “it could be worse” which makes one delay or deny crucial treatment."

It’s still me clinging to my eating disorder, but also making sure I eat enough with the right nutrition. Part of it can be triggering, as your ed will cheer that you are “staying in control” but for me, I need to make sure I’m eating enough because my bodily cues are not reliable because of the health implications of my ed. Weigh (pun intended) the options, to keep a part of your ed, the calorie counting, or to discard it in favor of bodily cues, which for you, might be reliable. If so, follow that, but make sure you hit all the food groups, and be aware of your weight without weighing yourself if possible, or have someone else do it (for me I go to the unit and get weighed by my dietitian and I don’t see the number because I stand backwards.)"
EatingDisorders,flhyih0,t1_flf3yvv,1585171897.0,"No problem. If anything helps, I’m glad.

I think we are angry because treatment or help, for most of us, resulted in suffering, and even though my ed could have taken my life, and the hospital saved with my doctor’s orders, it almost killed me because of all the trauma that went down there. We want(ed) to hang onto our ed, and whenever something or someone threatened it, we revolt. Having this deep seated anger towards those who tried to pull you out of your ed, is because we wanted no one to know, let alone help, because we were so entrenched in our ed.

I walk laps around my house to get exercise, I stretch, and sometimes work out also at home. On the cognitive level, try any distraction from the thoughts about food, things like self care, journaling, watching something or listening, art, etc. I can’t relate with cravings for snacks, but maybe chew gum or drink something without calories?

I’m in recovery for anorexia binge/purge subtype, and like your gf, am struggling in the midst of the coronavirus. I’m basically locked in my home all day, with only online university to distract me. When I’m working, I’m not worrying, when I’m not working I’m worried. I would suggest to your gf first, voice your concern. Let her know you care but are frightened that she is falling back into old habits. Some suggestions I have for dealing with an ed rn in these unprecedented circumstances, that she try to do things for herself. These things include journaling, art, self care, yoga, etc. That’s leisure. If she’s in school, suggest that she try to focus on that, namely, to not fall back into a relapse because (in my case at least) that means dropping out of uni. It’s hard, but try to evoke insight into her about how bad her ed was, instead of glamorizing it and wanting to go back, and make it clear that these feelings of worry and a need for control especially right now, are just feelings and will pass. Remind her that her ed is a bad coping mechanism, and work to build healthy ones. The isolation is detrimental, and as much as she wants to be alone to suffer in silence, she needs someone, she needs you. Talk to her honestly and openly without judgement. This virus is impacting everyone with an ed, currently suffering or in recovery, and no one is sure what to do exactly. For the therapy, try online sessions or suggest she ask her therapist to video chat if possible. Be there for her, and make sure others are too. Don’t give up on her."
