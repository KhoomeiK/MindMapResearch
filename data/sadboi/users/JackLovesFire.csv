ios,exi6v3m,t3_csy8xm,1566322251.0,"Same here, lifelong android user and last android phone a pixel. After having android since version 1.6 iOS felt like home, the learning curve was almost inexistant. Everything is simple, clear and easy, no workarounds, only straight foward actions and now more than ever with the gestures. 

I think the only thing that you will have to adapt is with the file management. You will need itunes to transfer files and you don't have a generic full file explorer like android phones do so everything looks cleaner and safer but at the same time more restricted."
MaxMSP,ex3mvp0,t1_ex2pmk9,1565988089.0,"The javascript object that I made is the following:

&#x200B;

`var sampler = new Buffer(""track"");`  
`var sample_array = new Array();`  
`function arraybuffer() {`  
 `var framecount = sampler.framecount()`  
 `var source = sampler.peek(1, 0, framecount);`  
   
 `for (var i=0; i< framecount; ++i) {`  
   
 `var sample_array = source[i];`  
`}`  
 `outlet(0,sample_array);`  
`}`  


The object gives me an array variable filled with all the samples of the selected buffer and return it to max, so now I have a buffer to array function in Max.  Now I have no clue on how to send it over a socket because the array is gigantic, so I don't know if there is enough bandwitdh for serial communication. I've send little packets of data over serial, osc, to arduinos, raspberry pi, but this case seems more complex."
depression,ex33ld8,t3_cqqe91,1565979625.0,"That's a big step, keep it up, you chose to take an step foward, so keep the momentum and fuck depression (but we aware that it can hit you back in every moment). You are really lucky of having another person that understands your situation and supports you, sometimes even the closest people can't understand why you are how you are and that's really frustrating."
MaxMSP,ex2fqur,t1_ex0wfz4,1565968636.0,"For the moment I've made a javascript object that just copies the buffer into an array of values with the peek function, so it worked just as you said. Now I'm wondering how to send this array made in the js object inside max, I will try to send the array via udp and then catching it with a python script. Any ideas?

Thanks for your advice"
