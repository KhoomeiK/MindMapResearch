Some buyers are using it to scam sellers, such as returning (with their own paid method/shipping label) to the same zip code they purchased it from. This dupes the system somehow. People are losing over $800+ on these scams, and I have no idea how Paypal looks into it. That's def much more elaborate of a scam. Now it's up to us whether we want to sell or buy. I def do the research before purchasing something. I just can't believe people are doing this very thing and it checks out in the Paypal/Ebay systems."

I had to email the buyer directly and ask them what was the claim for considering we talked before the item was shipped. I do all of this to assure I’m contacting buyer directly and to show proof they are aware a package is arriving to their address provided.

depression,fomlk4t,t3_g88b7i,1587894617.0,"Hello there, I’m 35, suffer with depression and anxiety myself. This illness takes a lot away from us, and it is a constant battle. I also have had horrible luck with relationships. I did manage to finish college and work in a field helping youth and families. This is what I’ve been doing since I got done college. I used to also do freelance photography, things were super great. I saw a future. Then things took a horrible turn and I spiraled. I lost so many of my network for work and also many friends. I live at home to help my mom and our dogs, living alone would be detrimental for me because isolation would destroy me.

I agree, yes college degrees or skills in a trade will be helpful and open doors. Make connections with people in different fields if you can. I can barely talk to people but I did. 
I’m single and nobody wants to be with me, but I financed and paid off my first car, and school loans.

I am super depressed and anxiety doesnt help. I understand how you feel. Don’t worry about what others may think, we all move at our own pace in life. Other day someone told me they were 32 and divorced and it upsets them. 

Just do your best and set different goals. I know depression gets in the way and takes motivation from you. I believe there are still things out there to enjoy and get into. 

I think I have always been hard on myself and felt like a complete mess, but I try to remember the good I’ve brought to the lives of others. I try to hang onto that. If I would’ve ended my life, I feel too many people would be hurt or broken by it. I don’t get why but I just know it would hurt them."
Ebay,folyqnl,t1_folyh4k,1587873738.0,"If you believe you have been scammed this would go under fraud. Of course it has to be an amount you’re trying to recover. I think I’ve seen some people file police reports for phones they’ve sold and never got back, etc. The police has to assist you and agree to investigate. eBay has also been informing some sellers to do the same if they can no longer help you anymore. If everything checks out in their system and it doesn’t appear to be fraud to them, there isn’t much they can do except suggest you file a report to help recover the cost. It’s a complicated circle."
Ebay,foly2pn,t1_foly0o6,1587873265.0,Yeah too costly of an item to just let it go and eBay and Paypal have already decided to give funds back to buyer so goodluck on this!

Ebay,folwniv,t3_g85vfc,1587872269.0,"Did the buyer ship it themselves or did you provide a return label?

offmychest,fn4fnmk,t3_fyy0ga,1586640415.0,"We have to remember looks eventually fade and we all grow up. Sure being attractive opens doors, but the doors you wanna walk through should be what you worked for and achieved. That feels better. You won’t have to grow up and worry about “my looks are fading” and when people stop obsessing over looks. You’ll have your focus on what matters in life and not something on the surface. I also think that people who are considered “pretty” on the outside are sometimes treated horribly when others don’t get what they want from them. They are called names worst than ugly or other things. They get a rep for being stuck-up, heartless and nothing else. I’ve seen both sides of this. They wind up hurt inside trying to prove themselves internally. I wish somebody taught me all this growing up. So just try to remember, it’s who you are that counts!"

They keep thinking there’s a loophole whenever Rio demands something of them. I wouldn’t try to find a loophole to spare Boomer after all the problems from last season.

I’ve been on eBay as a buyer for 20 years. 100% positive transactions. There were instances where sellers have told me their items are in India or China and not exactly in the country as stated. Which is honest. Some listings, it clearly states if it’s in Russia, Canada or elsewhere. Which is fine if I’m willing to wait. When I shop, I specifically put search results for US/North American region to ensure delivery time. 

Sellers usually communicate and we work everything out. What if someone has your money for 2 weeks without response or not informing you on whether or not its shipped. I’ve had many experiences with sellers and out of 1300 transactions, most went  pretty well. 

People downvoting me because this is a new situation during this time is just awful, if buyers cannot share their experiences then I don’t know why this sub even exists.

I’ve sold and purchased off eBay, I’ve contributed to this forum to help others like myself, and have never made assumptions about the transactions. I’ve paid immediately and right on time. Made effort to reach out to sellers. I’m just trying to get gloves and continue my work in an essential field working with families and their children.

He should already know there has to be a line drawn, and no you can't drink beer and have pizzas with your patients at night, especially if they're interested in you!! I don't understand what they're doing here with this plot. ALSO, his girlfriend seems absolutely sweet, even offering to come in and tutor his patients!"
