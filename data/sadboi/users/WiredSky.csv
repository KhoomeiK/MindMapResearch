SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Real answer: I don't know if he's underrated per se, but Richard Thomas as Gaad was phenomenal. Watching how his character reacted to and subtly changed as information came out and the extent of various situations became clear.  
  
  A scene that sticks out to me is after they find out about Martha, he's sitting in his office drinking. In a relaxed position, but clearly far from unburdened, and (I think in response to a hopeful outlook from Stan) says something to the effect of ""they married my secretary...and she put a bug in my office...""  
  
Very to the point and realistic, certainly by that point.  
  
Again, SPOILERS......his death was one of the hardest for me in the show, and possibly the one I still reacted to most upon rewatch. Just terrible and stupid (not the decision to kill him off). It would have been great if he could have still been a recurring character or even stayed in his position. But, as he said, his secretary put a bug in his office..."
