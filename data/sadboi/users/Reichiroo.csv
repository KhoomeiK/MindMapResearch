1. Tell your wife you will not stand behind that decision. It is not enough time to give your daughter to get the resources together she needs to find adequate housing and finances.

AmItheAsshole,foe6plp,t3_g6kkag,1587697127.0,"YTA for how you talk to and about your girlfriend. Rather than be proud she makes decent money, you sound jealous by saying she got lucky. Why is it any business of yours how she spends her money if you have separate finances? If the youtube channel has been beneficial to her and she wants to support it, why is that any of your business?

You're also the asshole for being way too old to be using the word simp."
AmItheAsshole,fodz9ig,t3_g6qw2f,1587692951.0,"YTA. There is a chain of command for a reason. You dont immediately include the CEO. Your supervisor told you to stop because the CEO told them to tell you. They have a company to run and you're spamming up their email with things they don't care about. If you're having issues getting answers, go to your supervisor for escalation."
careerguidance,fo5k9un,t3_g5sklc,1587527720.0,"My story would not make you feel better. Lol. But it did eventually end up okay.

I will say that networking while you're still at university is a good thing. Your professors have contacts within your desired field and can be really helpful in that regard.

On the painful reality side of things, be ready to look outside the box depending on your career path. You might have to take a detour to keep yourself financially sound while looking for what you truly want."

1. He has messed with your credit score. Even if you've been paying each month, having a higher amount outstanding brings your score down.

2. If he said not to tell your mom, that means he has OTHER maxed out cards and your mom might not realize how bad their financial situation is.

Immediately remove his access to the account. He can pay you back my check or cash app. Only give him the option to pay it off... not put you more in debt.

Tell your mom that you're concerned that if he's maxing out your card that there might be a bigger issue and you're concerned. That will get the conversation rolling. He'll be mad, but this is his mess and he's now made it your mess. It isnt fair to make you keep it a secret."
relationship_advice,fnutpqe,t1_fntdqyw,1587270831.0,What is she trying to prove? Have you ever treated her like she's less than just because she's a woman? You already know she is strong and obviously you like that about her and respect it or you wouldnt play fight with her. Ask her what this is really about.
AmItheAsshole,fnunipr,t3_g3rsmk,1587266362.0,YTA. If you had to go behind her back you already know it was shitty. Obviously those items were important to her. Why couldnt you sell something of your own?

jobs,fnlnxnb,t3_g2a1nk,1587056743.0,"I think you're over thinking it. It is expected that you would be nervous in a new role and the working from home is new to everyone, so you'll probably find your co-workers more empathetic than anything. Also, as the newest member of the team, it makes sense to not speak up unless spoken to as they don't expect answers from you. 

With practice and once you get more comfortable with the team you'll get better in meetings. Think about how much you're focusing on your own social quirks and how little you probably notice anything weird your coworkers might do. This is because we're all mainly focused on ourselves - they're not focusing on your small awkward behaviors as they're too busy worrying about how they sound or their portion of the workload. 

And if it makes you feel better, we recently had a 500 person town hall where someone didn't mute and started a tirade of inappropriate language not realizing the entire company could hear them. Whatever weird thing you might do on a conference call can't be worse than that! ;)"

The staff were dropping like flies. She was put in an isolation unit once it seemed she might have covid19 (she did end up testing positive) and her doctor wasn't even allowed access. Now she's recovering from essentially being left on her back for a month.

It can be hard to figure out how often to check in with your partner and spend time with them when you first move in with each other. Maybe you guys just need to figure out boundaries, especially with the current lockdowns."
