depression,fq9shze,t1_fq8sxnc,1589206135.0,"Yep, this is 100% how I've been feeling on and off for the past maybe year or so. I'm not suicidal at all, at least I don't think, but I just don't want to be here on this planet. The economy is trash, you have to fight everyday to make it in America, if feels like there's just fighting everywhere, and the justice system is just garbage. I have nothing to really look forward to in the future it doesn't feel like and even if I did, I don't really truly feel happy like I used to when I was a kid. I don't get excited for that new game or movie or whatever like I used to. It just all feels so meaningless and pointless. I have actually thought about it and if I get some kind of disease or something that has the potential to kill me, I wouldn't fight it. I'm already just so tired of existing I don't want to have to fight just to continue doing that. I don't want to live anymore, but I also don't have it in me to end it. It sucks for sure and I'm not really sure how to deal with it or if I even can."

You're welcome"
AskReddit,fozhf3v,t1_fozd40x,1588190707.0,"Right, which of course. Private property is another thing entirely. If they have a ""No Cameras"" rule on the property, then that's completely reasonable to expect to not be recorded. Another thing to note, the stores are probably recording you anyway for security reasons. So you're already on camera anyway"
unpopularopinion,foyx9xr,t3_g68tik,1588180894.0,"Couldn't agree more. I've been around non-natives and they absolutely REFUSED to adapt to the ways that people live here and would not for any reason let their own customs die, but still felt entitled enough to complain about how things work here. It's like, um, no you're not at your house in your country, you're living here now. Cut the shit, grow up, and learn how to live here just like you would expect of me if I were to visit your country. Respect is given where respect is due and if you don't want to respect someone else's ways, then go back to the country you came from.

I get it and I'll cut you a break if you're a new tourist or haven't been living here long, but 3 years and you still insist doing things your way!? Come on, that's ridiculous."
AskReddit,foyt9cq,t1_fovnck7,1588178755.0,"I mean, yeah I agree, no one like to be recorded without their consent, but, on the other hand, they aren't called ""public places"" arbitrarily. You're out in public (a shared place for multiple, unrelated people), with other people (who can see you anyway), who now have very good cameras on them at all times. Best play it safe and watch your own behavior! I think if more people just acted like they were being recorded at all times, the world might be a better place.

JusticeServed,fouwgr9,t1_fouvamv,1588091533.0,"Never said rape wasn't a big deal. It's an issue when anyone violates someone else's will and desires, in any situation.

Go read 5 comments from this thread. Go, go do it. See how disgusting and awful people are to this guy? Wishing he gets raped, killed, and the like? That's not ""being an advocate."" That's being a fucking disgusting piece of waste not even worthy of being called human. Guilty or not, he's still a person. A person who could very well be innocent from how I see it and I think everyone is worthy of an actual defense or at least a solid, lengthy look into issues like this that is treated with care and the respect and decency it deserves.

Being an advocate is one thing, of which I am. Being a filthy piece of trash towards another human being is another entirely."
JusticeServed,fouuhjp,t1_four83u,1588090608.0,"Okay, but everything you're saying is what I was saying too. I just didn't go into as much detail with it, which is my mistake yeah.

That's what I was talking about. He could've touched the driver's license of one of them and then went to the bathroom an hour later without washing his hands first and boom. wE fOuNd dNa eViDeNcE oN hIs pAnTs. And that somehow automatically means he raped 5 people, of which at least 2 were completely lying about."
JusticeServed,fouqhg6,t1_fouobai,1588088709.0,"Like I said, it's a difficult issue because both sides face issues whether it's true or not. You'd also be surprised how often people are malicious for no other reason than to be malicious. I'm not at all saying I wish anyone to go through that, but at the same time they better be able to back up their claims and realize what they could bring onto another persons life before they attempt to ruin it. I definitely believe people should be punished when they do other people wrong, including those who falsely accuse another person to that degree.

&#x200B;

BTW, go get some anger management buddy. Sounds like you've got some issues. Wouldn't want to hear about you hitting your wife or kids with that kind of anger. Chill out. This is a website where people come to share. Not this big of a deal."
JusticeServed,foulrds,t1_foujnh6,1588086369.0,"Okay, first, get educated about DNA. It's not foolproof like they show it to be in the movies and on TV. There can be so many issues and discrepancies with it. Not to mention who knows where it actually came from and how long ago it actually was introduced to any certain place.

Second, ever heard of planted evidence? The justice system is a joke."
JusticeServed,foukahs,t1_foujshl,1588085623.0,"Clearly you've never experienced bad people. They'll lie and cheat just to get ahead and stomp on other people. There have been other false rape allegations. That's what makes it such a difficult issue, because it's all just a he-said she-said and it ruins the persons accused lives, whether they actually did or not. People never look at them the same."
JusticeServed,fouj73p,t3_g9ac93,1588085053.0,"This guy wasn't given a fair trial and didn't do the things he was accused of actually. I saw a video about it awhile back and there was really no evidence supporting that he did those things. They just didn't have any better suspects and decided to not only put an innocent man in jail, but also completely destroy his life with these types of charges.

The justice system is fucked, the media is fucked, and all of the fuckers who eat it up without checking into it are even more fucked.

This isn't a video a guy balling cause he got caught, this is of someone who knows he's innocent and can do nothing because no one listens to his side or believes it. They scoff and spit on him because of something someone else said rather than meeting him in person or even looking into everything that went into this.

Since so many of you asked, go educate yourselves:

sffpc,fmx0f5y,t3_f9cr3o,1586456241.0," I love how so many people are like ""Remove the glass,"" ""Put more holes in it,"" ""The glass is useless,"" etc. It's there for a reason. Look at the website and you'll understand that wasn't just a design choice, although it does look sexy as hell. It actually creates a positive pressure with the AIO and graphics card pulling air in on opposite sides. Then, because the front is closed, all the hot air is directed out the back and away from you. If anythng, they need to punch a few holes in the top so air can naturally flow up and out as it should, putting more holes in the front won't help very much and actually may make cooling worse.

&#x200B;

What they actually should do is make it a little taller, put some minor ventalation on the top and add a puller fan to help direct the heat up and out as that's how it's going to want to flow anyway."

Come the end of July and my car breaks down. Just last week I found out my mom is gonna move out after almost 25 years of marriage to my dad.
