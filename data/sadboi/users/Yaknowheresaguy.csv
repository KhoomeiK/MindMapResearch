I was at my all time lowest a year ago and had this as a constant thought.  Through meds and a lot of therapy I made progress in climbing out of this hole, but this week I feel like I lost my grip and slipped back to almost the bottom of the hole again. So those thoughts and feelings are back with me, and it sucks.


I'm sorry you are feeling this way, too."
IAmA,f7w75b7,t1_f7sryg7,1574030541.0,"My daughter was born with the same condition, except she has an ear canal.  We had hoped the growing-in-the-lab options would be further along by now.  Our original doctors thought it would be common by this point, but the progress has been slower than they anticipated.


Your results from the rib cartilage stage look very solid.  For my daughter this key stage resulted in a total failure so we had to find another doctor that could help us start from scratch again.  We did find one that is across the country from us, and she is wonderful.  We had to go with an implant instead of rib cartilage, and other than one hiccup, it has borne positive results.  I'm hoping there will be no further complications and that we are done.


Good luck to you!!!!"

By my 30s, I would only go if I was solo and knew it would be small crowd attending.  I would have LOVED to have a friend give me this kind of hall pass.

I haven't asked my wife, but I think she would be more like your friend.  So I am with the OP, but agree he missed the mark.

I'm feeling close to my baseline of normal now.  Not normal in the normal sense, but the normal I've been accepting for the last couple of months.  It's way below my normal of 2 years ago, but way above my lowest points this time last year.  

I'm not sure if that all makes sense.  Regardless, I wish you the best and that you keep moving onward."

depression,f1nl2pz,t3_d9swuk,1569619677.0,"You have a level of self awareness which I think is such a double edged sword. The good part is you have caught yourself saying the phrase. I had a couple of decades of saying, whispering, and thinking, ""Idiot!"" directed at myself many, many, many times a day.  It was so routine and thoughtless that I didn't even mention it to my shrink until I had been in therapy for years.  

It is really hard to break the cycle, and I really hope you can do it.  We have all done (and still do) terrible and cringey things, and it sucks that your awareness makes you beat yourself all the time.  I hope you're able to replace that phrase with something that moves you is a more positive direction."
