bipolar,fecevo1,t3_enyftw,1578972259.0,Congrats!!! I was told I would never finish my undergraduate. I finished it and when on to get my masters. I was so determined to prove that I could do it that I never got below an A. You can do it. I came back stronger and more determined. I still wrestled with my mood but I wanted it.
bipolar,f4h83an,t3_dklhzt,1571589051.0,You said your first couple of months were good. Full blown mania doesn’t last months. Hypomania can last longer but still. It sounds like his friends accident might have been a trigger that caused his mood and feelings to change. I’d focus on what is best for you. He has set clear boundaries now you need to do the same. Bipolar isn’t an excuse to act like that sometimes it just provides context. Set your boundaries and respect yourself enough to take some time and then move on.
bipolar,f4h6iin,t3_dklgv3,1571588445.0,Definitely a challenging one. Waiting to long can make it seem as if you had something to hide but being to forward can scare people away before they get a chance to know you. I suggest waiting until you feel comfortable with the other individual. Everyone who enters a relationship has things they are afraid to share. When it gets to the point where you are both starting to open up and be vulnerable that would seem the time to begin sharing. Granted you don’t have to tell them the whole story in one conversation. It could just start with I have struggled with mental illness and slowly build from there over time.
