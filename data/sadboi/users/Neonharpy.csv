relationship_advice,fn8tyqn,t3_g06lbz,1586750178.0,It’s not normal however it isn’t unwarranted. Of course your gf should trust you but you might not know what has happened in her past or someone she knows past. Sadly almost every women I know has a story of something inappropriate happening from an older man as a child/teen. It’s scary as fuck how often it happens and from people you’d never expect. I would therapy might be helpful for you two. It feels like something deeper is going on in her mind even if you’ve never given her any reason to be worried .
PinkpillFeminism,fmr8lb2,t1_fmplv5n,1586316473.0,Don’t forgot also work 40 hours on top of all housework and cooking!
relationships,fmqj9u4,t3_fwlbw9,1586300699.0,Either commit or leave. She’s in a different phase than you she wants the house a marriage and kids. Leave her in peace if you don’t want to build that with her
bipolar,fl2nrnz,t3_flgngg,1584755431.0,LITERALLY lmao last week I deep cleaned my whole house I was finally feeling good after months of a depression slump I felt clear headed and energetic and was feeling like I could get shit back on track .. now this week it’s all this pandemic quarantine shit has made me feel like trash again. Can’t leave the house . No money unemployed. No ones hiring because of all this . My vacation is canceled and my moms out of work now too.The shops were all empty and I couldn’t buy anything I needed ugh.. I’ll survive but it’s just a lot right now... bright side is at least my house is clean and tidy to spend quarantine in . Lol
bipolar,fkbmxhz,t1_fkbbhhr,1584035977.0,Yess I do this I’ll spend like 12 hours “shopping” for my sims downloading custom content and then go into my game and create like 20 different sims with all the new hairs makeup and clothes I got . Really helps me not rein in that manic just wanting to shop mood
oilpen,fiiunhc,t1_fi67lr6,1582427319.0,Hey Just wanted so say I ordered the vmod the night I posted this and I got it today I love it . It feels so much more luxurious I guess than I expected for the price . Mad I paid more for an absolute shit pen from a local vape store when this one is dope
oilpen,fi83q51,t1_fi76nnb,1582232884.0,Thanks for the info that’s a bit out of my budget rn lol but I’ll keep that in mind because I would like to get something better quality when I have some extra money (:
oilpen,fi83fys,t1_fi82bnh,1582232721.0,Okay well I like them I don’t live in a legal state and they’re the best I’ve come across with no side effects so oh well. I asked for pen recommendations not carts
oilpen,fi826kj,t1_fi6ced1,1582232053.0,How so ?
oilpen,fi67qsi,t1_fi67lr6,1582182095.0,Thank you I was looking at that one but unsure if it would actually be good quality lol I think I’m just bittered over the fact I’ve bought so many pens from shops that break in a week lol
oilpen,fi67kgv,t3_f6p81h,1582181895.0,Also this probably goes with our saying but I’m looking for a 510 thread battery or whatever
Instagramreality,f8rof8r,t3_e1hrct,1574746650.0,Where ? I’m assuming we’re talking about the right side .... those are the fendi boots the top part is a softer fabric like socks but it’s all part of the boot
Instagramreality,f8pzb3n,t1_f8pydix,1574709669.0,Are you guys really arguing about panty hose when those are clearly boots
TrueOffMyChest,f7n1u1n,t3_dwycyr,1573881051.0,Well said 💖
Trufemcels,f7fjkpb,t3_dvqc2p,1573680778.0,This really hit home . Exactly how I feel
MealPrepSunday,f3o0uzu,t3_dhbjnx,1571005606.0,Literally can’t tell what a single dish on this post is ...
itsafetish,f0hf75g,t3_d4p5qa,1568620303.0,I would agree there’s definitely a link to porn addiction and transgenderism.
AskTruFemcels,ezmn8ev,t3_d1fsno,1567994543.0,Realistically I know I’m not the ugliest. I’m not like totally deformed or anything but looking in the mirror it feels that way. Fuck being fat and having sad misshapen facial features. As well as a natural awkward body shape 😭😭
Instagramreality,euaoqpo,t3_cfjyqa,1563627481.0,Some of y’all are just mean . Her hair looks like it’s pulled back in the second photo and it’s not a crime to take a flattering photo. Obviously an off guard full body picture looks a lot worse than a flattering face picture
AskTruFemcels,etajdpk,t3_caono8,1562621617.0,Don’t use tinder anymore but yeah I did swipe left a lot. Mostly tho I was swiping left on like the “chad” types and jockish looking guys and more urban looking guys because I knew they wouldn’t take me seriously if anything just want to use me for sex and ghost me . The people I’d swipe left on were mostly average looking guys who I thought seemed interesting/ had good bios that seemed like they wanted more than sex.
Sims4,erhvy0u,t3_c20gxl,1560884044.0,This is me when I move and the Snapchat filter comes off lmao
WireWrapping,eqitkfn,t3_byig9t,1560093390.0,This is so beautiful 💜 wish I could do something this awesome
BPD4BPD,epsdmsi,t3_bvrgyl,1559445333.0,Hope you’re coping! Sending love ❤️ message me if you need to talk to someone
