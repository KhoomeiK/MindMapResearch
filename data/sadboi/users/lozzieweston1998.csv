writers,fjn54s3,t3_fe93u3,1583498213.0,It depends. If I feel attached to the story I write it first to feel the formation of every word in it. If it’s just a bit of messing around I’d rather type it to save time
aww,fcjrmhl,t3_ehgbnr,1577701165.0,This honestly made my heart leap awww this is so cute you’re really incredible
depression,fbix02v,t3_edhcd2,1576918059.0,I’m the one people ditch  constantly I’m that uninteresting
creepyPMs,fbg9prw,t3_ecu85x,1576841522.0,Anyone else hate it when people apologise but then immediately continue to guilt trip you? Like nah dude don’t apologise then carry on what’s the point
depression,fb43g1l,t3_ebcyd4,1576500537.0,"I’ll message you and ask are you ok? Well, it’s a comment but same thing basically"
depression,f9k11bm,t3_e53rk1,1575390440.0,"I have a similar problem too. This really touched me, I’m glad I saw this and now know I’m not alone in this"
depression,f92f6fg,t1_f91es1z,1575028182.0,"The platitude I get thrown by family always annoys me. Suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. 
First of all how do you know it’s temporary
Second of all isn’t having a permanent solution kinda the point? It doesn’t make sense. Always gets to me that one..."
BreakUps,f7u0xji,t1_f7u0may,1574009535.0,Ok thank you
BreakUps,f7tt0sz,t1_f7tpv21,1574007406.0,The first one definitely. That hit home so hard
BreakUps,f7to5m8,t1_f7rpzi5,1574006095.0,I feel you
BreakUps,f7tnv6p,t1_f7rqa8o,1574006066.0,I am in therapy but for other reasons. She knows about him but there’s not a lot that can be done. We haven’t been together for over a year now (we dated twice) but he goes the same uni as me so I still see him around
BreakUps,f7riz48,t1_f7rim77,1573982169.0,I’ve had a couple after my first love and you do fall in love again but it isn’t the same as the first. It’s different. I don’t know if you think that’s a good thing or if it helps any but you will love someone again it just won’t feel the same as the first time. I’m just still pining for my first love because I’ve had a shitty time with relationships
BreakUps,f7l765i,t1_f7l45ed,1573834166.0,"If he comes back to you, I’d consider shutting him down. 1) that’s a terrible excuse to give to someone when you’re breaking up with them. 2) If he’s showing interest in another girl after you had been together for 10 years and you haven’t been separated that long then you got to remember that it can happen again and how much did he really love you if he can do that so quick? You want someone who only sees you and doesn’t have an interest in anyone else. You deserve so much better"
BreakUps,f7h9k5c,t3_dw6485,1573735830.0,How long can it take to get over someone? I don’t get the chance to have time to get over mine. He goes the same university as me and even if we don’t talk for a while he eventually reaches out and everything gets reopened and I have no idea how to deal with it and just wanted know how much time it takes to get over someone
BreakUps,f6jfcxc,t3_drcmxh,1572893850.0,A question for the people on here but does anyone know of anyone who has actually fought to keep the other person? Just out of curiosity don’t wanna spark anything just never had it myself so just wondering if it is something that happens
BreakUps,f6gohfd,t1_f6gnwtr,1572828459.0,Thank you for this it means a lot
UnsentLetters,f4kogzc,t3_dkt5m5,1571655363.0,Actually crying right now.
lonely,eywck0a,t3_cz2o7o,1567526289.0,Reading this I have never related more to someone’s story. I too have these problems. I’ve made female friends before but over a period of time I seem to become a last option for them so more often than not I’ll spend months on end alone doing nothing. I find it easier befriending males than females but same as you they seem to want sex or to date and I don’t want that. I have dated a male friend once before and I lost that friendship when we broke up so I understand your fear with that one. It’s just hard to find someone who you can bond with as a friend and who will stick around no matter whether they have better options or not. I really feel for you and I’m in the same boat as you. Social anxiety can make it extremely hard too so there are probably others struggling the same
mentalhealth,eyq5ezx,t3_cy1oj1,1567325947.0,I feel like this one is one of those things that you have to be careful with. I’ve met people who are mentally sound and know it. I’ve met people who are mentally sound and fake mental illness for the attention (which as someone with mental illness I consider rather rude and disrespectful) and then I have my little group of friends all of which have some sort of mental illness (not on purpose just I seem to connect with people with a mental illness better because they’re just as shy as me). It’s just one of those things you have to be able to look for to know which one it is because everyone struggles at times it’s just knowing when someone’s having a tough time and when someone is struggling with a mental illness
lonely,ex6orz3,t3_crj7ca,1566049087.0,Sometimes I feel like this too. Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether it is a real thing or if it’s just a bedtime story people tell kids to give them some sort of hope in the future
