As I understand it OP is feeling insecure of their skills precisely because they have been performing duties for which they feel overqualified  (and hence underpaid in relation to a position with more involved tasks they could have been performing and earning more regardless where that position would necessarily be more a more senior one or not) and fear they may have undergone skill attrition.

El articulo parece indicar mas, a mi entender, los paises Asiaticos han sido mas exitosos en controlar el brote del virus mas debido a las lecciones aprendidas en experiencias con brotes anteriores que a una adherencia a un sistema politico de gobierno en particular o incluso diferencias culturales, poniendo de ejemplo a Hong Kong y Taiwan. Al mismo tiempo menciona que en el Oeste los gobiernos han sido negligentes con respecto a una „capacidad estatal en salud publica y preparacion“ frente a posibles epidemias y falta de decisividad y coordinacion en la toma de decisiones.

A mi me parece, de las opiniones que encuentro en internet, que en el Oeste los gobiernos y la gente en general se han confiado mucho en que el virus no podria ser muy grave debido a un sentimiento de desarrollo economico y cultural. Me parece que hay un sentimiento que la gente pensaba que porque vive en Europa o en America, donde los paises son economicamente fuertes y democraticos o tienen costumbres „normales“ entonces no habia que preocuparse. Tambien pienso que quiza los gobiernos aqui estaban mas preocupados por la economia de sus paises que por la salud publica."

I am not saying I deserve it more than other Canadians, since to my understanding, CERB is for all Canadians who are experience hardship due to the current situation (+ additional requirements).

1) I don't reside in Canada, but abroad. I came here in 2018 for degree studies and I am not finished yet. (This reason is, to me, the most understandable disqualification, but I think it is still unfair since I am a Canadian citizen, and Canada is ultimately my home)  
2) I did not make $ 5000 last year (in Canada), since I was here. I did make some money here. Not much, but maybe after converting it would $ 5000, but doubt it counts?  
3) For the past almost 6 months I have had no employment outside of a small student job at the university with minimal hours (and consequently minimal overall pay) as I had a leg injury and had to leave the other part-time job I had (required some physical exertion).
