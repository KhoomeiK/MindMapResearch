GoodGirls,fq6o3uj,t1_fpvysuz,1589135268.0,I feel like Dean is growing on me. He’s shown some growth since the first season. And I really hope he and Beth can work their marriage out.
GoodGirls,fq6nvbe,t1_fq1rsww,1589135137.0,"I don’t know how far they can take this plot with Rio, though. If they do continue on with him I think it’ll end up like ‘Revenge’ where it has to have a definitive ending. Nowhere else to go."
GoodGirls,fq6njw5,t3_ggsalj,1589134965.0,We all know the writers like us to think that one storyline is done but bring it back several episodes later to give us anxiety. I don’t know if the Lucy/Max story is completely done. But it really didn’t add much. All it did was make me even more disgusted with Rio.
Anxiety,fp0e7y5,t1_foyy3pr,1588207559.0,I think I developed IBS from anxiety. Right now I’m super bloated and have had horrible headaches the last week.

TheBachelorette,fkax4tv,t3_fh8es9,1584021482.0,"I just saw the guys. They’re all babies! Don’t make Clare into a cougar. I think MAYBE there are 5 guys over 30 and one who’s over 40. This is setting the season up for failure. No man is ready for marriage at 23, ABC — and you know that! They need to really think about viable options over “good” tv."

90DayFiance,fk1l511,t1_fk1kil6,1583781875.0,"Yes — we’re all aware that most people who actually have $$ do not flash it. However, that does not align with Darcey and Stacey’s M.O. Hence, why I brought up this mismatch. They’re flashy. They want everyone to know how much they supposedly have. 

Also, I never said that a car equated wealth. It’s one of the worst investments ever. But for people like Darcey and Stacey it would make sense for them to have a luxurious vehicle because of what they try to portray."
90DayFiance,fk1il7y,t1_fk1cahu,1583780403.0,I know that re: wealthy people. But in this case with Darcey and Stacey it doesn’t make sense. Especially since they’re trying to portray a luxurious lifestyle. It’s insane.
90DayFiance,fk1bvke,t1_fk1b8qe,1583776516.0,Seriously staged 😂
90DayFiance,fk1bhyv,t1_fk1bdqy,1583776300.0,A VW is lightyears ahead of a Nissan — coming from someone who owned one many moons ago. Your car is still considered luxurious by comparison.
90DayFiance,fk1bdbe,t1_fk1b2ak,1583776224.0,Yep. She’s literally an OG. She’ll never graduate to 90DF.
90DayFiance,fk1b1ok,t3_ffyizf,1583776039.0,What are the odds it’s authentic? I remember a post a while ago someone said Darcy wore knock off Loubs. Why is she going to great lengths to wear phony bologna items like people can’t tell? 😩
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fk0u1ni,t1_fk0g7sd,1583766147.0,I thought I was the only one who thought she looked older than 34. I’m 33 and haven’t aged as poorly as she has. She needs some rest and a good skin care routine.
90DayFiance,fjzesrm,t3_ffktwb,1583718039.0,He’s so cringe.

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjb2k0x,t3_fc65mz,1583185240.0,"I have a little tea...

I read on an Instagram fan site for LIB that they both had agreed not to get married. But continue to date instead. Well, Kelly changed her mind at the last minute. 

I think Kenny handled the situation with so much class. I felt genuinely bad for him. But he dodged a bullet with Kelly and her MLM work. I think he had the potential to be exciting but he was matching what she gave off. I think he was playing it safe for her. Kelly is super boring 😂 Some of her outfits were cute, though. And I think Kenny looked better than Kelly. Just my humble opinion."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj5d1pz,t1_fj59pfk,1583029781.0,I honestly feel like LC would’ve been a better match for him.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj56dkv,t3_fbfb2t,1583025275.0,Nope! Mae? (Parenthood)  looks better.

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj566ew,t3_fbjtmx,1583025139.0,She’s super intense. And it’s definitely not in a good way. I got domestic violence vibes from her.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj4ir3m,t3_fb61ry,1583009217.0,I couldn’t stand him. Not one bit.

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj4hew9,t1_fizwuvx,1583008334.0,I thought I missed something. That tailor was absolute trash. His tux was all bad! Looked like something he grabbed off a rack in a rush. Smh. I would re-take my wedding photos 🤷🏾‍♀️
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj4gfv8,t1_fj0xt41,1583007680.0,Lmao @ aggressively average. I must use this.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj4g4me,t1_fj0kqgs,1583007473.0,"He was DEFINITELY classy for what he said after Kelly walked out. I thought he was a sweet guy. Her family liked him, too."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj4fgzf,t1_fj3azee,1583007039.0,Cameron is the GOAT! I could tell he had a little swag when they were in the pods. I thought they would be good together.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj4esmo,t1_fj3z53i,1583006595.0,But they didn’t get married. That was the premise of the show.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj357to,t1_fj34b8x,1582967882.0,Kelly and Kenny didn’t make it and neither did Damian and Giannina...

netflix,fj2xuu9,t1_fhyopxt,1582958050.0,I CANNOT stand him! The way he flipped it on Diamond and made it her fault that he wasn’t completely honest from the beginning. He really expected her to accept him after that. I’m glad ‘Murrica got to see who he really was — not the broken man who had a fear of rejection because no one understands him.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiztfr3,t1_fibe37b,1582873971.0,"Lmao. I’m lying in bed, next to my husband, and I had to snicker quietly at your comment. But I want to guffaw 😂😂"
debtfree,fivhawy,t3_fa29qu,1582760289.0,"Sitting down and listing all of your debts, the amounts, etc. We decided to the snowball method was best for us. Start by paying off the smallest of your debts and work up to the larger ones. What it does is make you feel a sense of accomplishment when you begin paying off the small ones. Then, take what you were throwing at one debt and add it to the next debt. Just eat the elephant one bite at a time :)"
thebachelor,fiuxhos,t1_fhaht7t,1582750045.0,"Peter is very boring. The most exciting thing about him is his being bilingual. LOL. Que triste! The Bachelor is really for vanilla Middle America. It wasn't designed to reflect what the rest of the country actually looks like. 

This is only the second season that I've seen. The first was the one with Jake Pavelka and Vienna. The lack of diversity being the reason I hadn't watched in so long."

90DayFiance,ff3knie,t1_ff33mal,1579543073.0,Wait — he has 7 not 5??? I missed this! Omg. Anny needs to go back to DR. If he lied about how many kids he has he’ll lie about any/everything.

I CANNOT stand her. She’s in the Top 5 worst people from every season. She’s self-centered, condescending, disrespectful, etc. I wish he would break up with her. He can do a lot better with just a basic human being."
90DayFiance,fclqs0k,t1_fclke4l,1577754198.0,I read somewhere it’s only like $1500.
90dayfianceuncensored,fcixsj2,t3_eh0ku6,1577672381.0,I don’t feel sympathy for her at all. She knew that man didn’t want to be bothered with her kids from the beginning and continued to pursue him. She’s a horrible person.
90dayfianceuncensored,fbzp6h0,t3_ef4wov,1577254824.0,I feel so bad for him. She’s such a trash person. And she can’t say the editing is what makes her look bad. Choosing to go on an optional trip for “self improvement” in the middle of your 90 days is very selfish. And to expect him to get along with no friends or family...? I’m over her. Syngin needs to find some other woman who’ll actually care about his feelings since she says he’s too clingy.
90DayFiance,fb9rmzl,t1_fb9n9o4,1576647360.0,I’ve liked her from the beginning. I think she’s justified in her reaction to things he does because he’s full of bologna. Robert is the scammiest scammer since Mohammed.
90DayFiance,fb9o0pk,t1_fb3d5xa,1576643967.0,I love this name for him! King Baby 🙌🏾
