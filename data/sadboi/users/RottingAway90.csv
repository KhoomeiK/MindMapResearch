As for self-diagnosis, I‚Äôm not 100% against it as getting a professional diagnosis can be timely and costly and I do think people can be quite intuitive in understanding their own symptoms. It took me until I was 29 to get a diagnosis, before then I‚Äôd been misdiagnosed with depression for years and wondering why anti-depressants weren‚Äôt doing shit. For years I felt I needed therapy to address my childhood trauma, but was discouraged because it didn‚Äôt meet the PTSD criteria (war, near-death experiences etc) and I had internalized all these notions about being ‚Äúwhiny‚Äù. I eventually ended up having a major mental breakdown and it‚Äôs only just now that I‚Äôve received a BPD diagnosis and am getting appropriate treatment. I only wish it didn‚Äôt have to get to the point of attempting suicide, being admitted to hospital, and ruining my life/relationships for that to happen. So yeah, my perspective is that it can help to follow your own instincts and intuition in regard to mental health.

But the OP was specifically referring to a certain kind of misogyny encountered online, and I was just making the point that most normal well-adjusted people aren‚Äôt going around calling people Beckies and Stacies and talking about the Wall. That‚Äôs it."
AskTruFemcels,fnnsjxd,t1_fnns6st,1587100456.0,"I‚Äôm not excusing men lol, I just think it‚Äôs straight up unhealthy to assume every dude is getting off to violent rape fantasies and purposely rubbing their semen on unsuspecting women. Sure most men have a certain percentage of sexist asshole to them, but you also gotta remember Reddit is a cesspool."
AskTruFemcels,fnnqx0x,t1_fnnpj4y,1587099160.0,"The normalization of violent porn is a concern but it isn‚Äôt all porn, there are many other categories which are very popular. So I wouldn‚Äôt assume every man who watches porn is fulfilling some violence kink. 

Also the men I interact with never touch me without consent, even just on the shoulder. Of course it‚Äôs gross to think of coming into contact with traces of semen, but germs are everywhere including fecal matter. All you can really do is be cautious and maintain good hygiene."
AskTruFemcels,fnnpbm4,t1_fnnivdh,1587097948.0,"I‚Äôm just talking male friends and acquaintances here, not anyone I‚Äôm involved with - so I could care less what they‚Äôre doing in the bathroom lol. 

Undoubtedly a lot of men look at porn, but most of them aren‚Äôt involved in manosphere subculture I suppose is what I‚Äôm saying."
AskTruFemcels,fnnd5b0,t3_g2rz60,1587089649.0,"Yeah I‚Äôve been trying to avoid male online spaces and have found I‚Äôve been much happier and less self-conscious. Almost every guy I‚Äôve met irl doesn‚Äôt even know what Incel terms are and gives me a weird look when I bring them up. When I was browsing that stuff all the time, I was convinced I was hideous but I‚Äôve actually been hit on a fair bit since I‚Äôve tried to relax and be less insecure. So I dunno. 

I guess there‚Äôs just fear that what you read online represents men‚Äôs ‚Äúreal thoughts‚Äù or real conversions with other men - and that they‚Äôre only nice to you irl to look socially acceptable."

AsianBeauty,fc5kqge,t1_fbzs6r6,1577460220.0,Comes out clear and stains the skin after. It‚Äôs not immediately noticeable but I got the ‚Äúbad fake tan‚Äù effect after using it for a week or so. Pity because it‚Äôs otherwise a great product.  :(

AusSkincare,f7sbfuk,t1_f7rryrc,1573993002.0,Haha yeah it‚Äôs definitely not a look for everyone but I‚Äôm seeing more and more people wearing them and they can have a cyberpunk aesthetic with the right outfit. Is there a reason you prefer physical sunscreen to chemical?
