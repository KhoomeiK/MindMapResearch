Too much hand patting will not get me to the changes I need to improve my life.  Too much confrontation will antagonize me and make me want to quit.  It’s a tricky balance and I feel like when they talk about “goodness of fit” they are talking about finding that right combination that will work for you.

The lack of physical proximity makes me feel a little less anxious/uncomfortable/scared.  That makes it easier for me to relax, feel safer, and be more open.

I now know what he looks like, what kinds of facial expressions he makes even if I don’t know what they mean, and I can kind of remember an image of him in my head when he’s not there.

They do this not to punish us but because they can’t work with us if instead of working with them to get through it suicide is always on the table when things are rough.  They want to take that off the table as an option and instead have us lean on the therapeutic relationship and process.  Having said that, I think you have a good shot at being able to continue therapy with this person if you do the chain analysis.  My gut feeling is that they’ve given you a way out of this quandary.  If getting treatment from this therapist is what you want because you’ve found them/their methods helpful, then do the exercise as honestly and with as much insight as you can.  Show him you’ve learned from your experiences and that you’re willing to put in the work and not use suicide as a way out.  I’m sorry if I sound harsh.  I’m not trying to be.  But I’ve been sort of in the same place as you and I don’t want you to lose a valuable resource/therapeutic relationship (if that’s what he is) because good help is SO hard to find, especially for “high needs” or patients with more severe problems.

Now I’m “failing” at therapy so hard.  I put that in quotes because rationally I can understand that therapy doesn’t work that way.

“why did she tell me this...?”

I’m 100% sure it was NOT to make you feel bad.  You are not responsible for her feelings.  It seems like maybe she told you how she felt (and therapists don’t normally disclose unless it’s for a therapeutic reason) in order to model a different way of processing emotions, one where she owns her own emotions and it’s ok, and you can talk about it, and she will still be there for you.  You didn’t destroy her, she doesn’t hate you, you didn’t fail her or *cause* her pain and suffering.

You got yourself to stay with the difficult feelings with her and it turned out ok.  I think *this* is the work of therapy and you’re doing great!  

And who knows, maybe there’s a little bit of people pleaser in her too (there is in most of us probably) and she wants to make your sessions as positive as she can for you.  But as you understand how your own anxiety is your own, her own anxious tendencies (if she has any) are her own as well."

This is well put.  You’ve described how I’ve felt about therapy since the very beginning.  The other day I was having random post-therapy barely-there thoughts, not really actively thinking about anything, when a clear thought popped into my head: “This is going to end badly for me.”  Deep down inside (my emotional side?) I am utterly convinced of this, and it makes me want to fight with my therapist when really it’s just me fighting myself.  

It would feel like a huge rejection to me too.  That’s why I never ask anything and I never ask *for* anything.  I think it’s brave of you to take steps to from connection despite your fear/misgivings, and I think your T was not attuned to see that.

And thinking nobody knows how you feel even you’ve tried so hard to communicate, and the one person you connected with is gone leaving you alone.

Do you get any sense of support or relief from your current therapist?  These feelings of betrayal and abandonment seem like something important to talk about in therapy.  Especially if it’s a pattern you’ve experienced in your life in other relationships, or if you’ve felt that way in the past.  This is the work of therapy - to use our current difficult feelings and try to connect them to why we may feel the way we do, and hopefully gain insight in order to grow, and heal, and make positive changes in our life.

Also, since our therapists cannot be with us 24/7 (and never when we *really* need them), have you both talked about what to do during moments of emotional pain and they’re not available?  It may be helpful to have a self-care toolkit for getting through those times - things like coloring book/pencils (I know, I thought it was stupid too), a jigsaw puzzle, knitting/crochet or model building, something to do with your hands, or I will listen to calming meditation music on my phone with the nature scenes (even when it’s too hard for me to meditate), or journaling."
MadOver30,fp1z9y1,t3_gaaj3n,1588251695.0,"I think it’s great that you are aware of the need to not make your SO your caretaker.  

In any relationship there’s always going to be give and take.  There are things that both parties contribute to the relationship.  He wouldn’t choose to be with you if there weren’t.  You are a person of worth as well and it sounds like you don’t always see it.  Maybe you’re struggling with your mental health, but you ARE working at it.  

Also, going to be periods when he’s overwhelmed and needs you to support him as well.  This could be things such as health issues, unemployment or problems at work, or relationship problems with his own family.  So while it looks like he’s got it more together than you, that might not be 100% accurate if you look under the hood.  Everyone struggles and needs help at some time in their life.

I think communication and honesty is key.  I have some serious MH issues myself (which thankfully is pretty stable right now) and I’ve been with my husband for a LONG time.  When I’m in crisis and barely able to function I lean on him a lot and it feels very uneven and like he’s my caretaker just as you describe.  But I’m not always like that, and I’ve helped him through accidents and illnesses and relationship problems and work problems.  And together we’ve tackled major life decisions.  I have also talked to him quite honestly about not wanting him to turn into a surrogate parent for me, and to take care of his own mental health needs, and to set boundaries and make sure his life doesn’t revolve around taking care of me.  I need him to be himself, the person I married.

But you don’t have to wall yourself off and reject support from someone who loves you in order to “protect” him.  You’re right, it’s going to require a balance, between leaning on each other for support and retaining independence and individuality.  That really goes for all aspects of a relationship though."

I’ve skimmed his research publications, I’ve seen an obscure YouTube video of a conference presentation of his, I’ve perused his cv...  His professional online presence is fair game and I know he knows this since he put it out there (or is aware of it).  He even maintains a Twitter account where he mainly retweets colleagues’ stuff or reviews of research articles (actually these days many companies encourage their professional staff to maintain social media in order to market their company’s presence and influence).

TalkTherapy,fonycf1,t3_g8cwjp,1587928888.0,"Oof.  My therapist and I are close to the same age and he actually said this to me several weeks ago, right before the Easter break.  He said, “You’re a grown woman but you sound like a child.”  

I didn’t react at the time, but for days afterwards I was incredibly incensed.  Until I calmed down and thought about the context of how he said it.  It did not feel fair and it felt incredibly hurtful but I did eventually allow myself to understand what he was saying to me.  

I have problems communicating with him.  I will say things and leave him to guess what I mean.  Other times I assume that he just knows things without me having to explain.  And I get mad and irritable when he doesn’t immediately“get it” or when he disagrees with my viewpoints.

That day he said (in not so many words) that I had just made a sweeping statement, taken it to some extreme conclusion, was unwilling to explain how I got there, unwilling to examine my (immature) thought processes around it, and was expecting him to go along with me. 

I am generally a mature person.  I have been since I was super little kid.  I never had a childhood in any real sense.  So it hurts really bad when someone accuses me of being childish.  At the same time I know that there are parts of me that are not the same age I am, and they’re stuck in the past, and that I still follow rigid rules I developed so many years ago to protect myself.  Cognitive distortions, maladaptive behaviors (that once WAS an adaptation to my environment), black and white thinking, attachment fears, this is my legacy of having had to grow up so fast I left myself behind.  So my therapist was not wrong and he was not being unkind.  He was pointing it out and in doing so taking a big risk that I wouldn’t just quit and not come back.

I can’t tell from your post whether your therapist meant to challenge you the same way.  If you’re unsure you can ask her what she meant when she said what she did.  Hopefully it would make a really growth enhancing conversation.

Edit to add: She may be describing belief patterns or certain ways you have of behaving or communicating that are younger than your own age (not necessarily in comparison to HER age).  But if she’s called you childish several times already then at the very least it warrants pointing out to her that you find this language offensive.  It’s hard to continue in therapy when a client feels lack of respect from the therapist."

Regarding cutting off emails to your therapist, I have definitely done that.  I also did it to punish him, but a part of me knew I was punishing myself too.  I also have difficulty talking in therapy (a part of me will not allow me to talk, I’ll call this Part A) and my emails were my attempts to communicate (another part of me desperately does want help, call this Part B).  So when my T does something that hurts me, Part A gets furious and wants to punish all of us.

I think for me, being super close to what felt like the end of my life made me stop caring about the “lesser” things.  I am normally an extremely anxious person by nature, and being that seriously “depressed” (again, not sure if it was the depression) sort of made me not give a f* about things that would normally make me anxious, like caring what other people thought of me.  

It’s like whereas before I’d rush my way to work, and even being a tiny person, I could out-walk, out-shove, with the best of them on public transit, but suddenly I found myself noticing the random person in need of help or steadily meeting the gaze of a homeless person asking for money.  I wasn’t any “better” than anyone else after all, and my time and my interests were not more important.  It’s easy to get caught up... think things like “if I stop to help this person I’m going to miss that train and then be late to my meeting and look bad in front of my boss” (not that there’s anything wrong with wanting to be on time, it’s just that I’m overly anxious about something that’s not even been a problem) and then start to resent everything that “gets in my way”.  It would be like resenting my kid (I don’t have kids) for wanting my attention when I have to prepare for a big presentation tomorrow.  

Also, instead of being afraid of making a fool of myself or embarrassing myself I decide to take a risk because who gives a f*, right?  Or being honest and saying what I really think instead of trying to protect myself and not to make waves.  Because telling the truth is more honorable and more important.

1-Because as you’ve stated if you’re going to do it, nothing and nobody can stop you.  Even if they involuntarily committed you to keep you safe, that’s only temporary.

2-Your therapist knows that ultimately what you do is not their responsibility.  Therefore, they are prepared for this type of disclosure.  And they’re prepared to listen, and be fully present with you.  

3-Because your therapist knows that contrary to popular layperson’s belief, talking about SI does NOT increase the risk.  And there is a chance that it might help you understand where these urges are coming from, and knowing that, maybe you’ll both be able to figure out what to do.

I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or not but I was just having the same kinds of thoughts myself, although I’m nowhere as far along as you are in your thoughts.

He has said in the past that he *wants* me to tell him about SI and that he can think of NOTHING more important to talk about in therapy.

For me, just talking, talking about anything, can free up my mind just enough to help me relax just a little bit and get the juices flowing again.  I feel like I become “stupid” in therapy, and I fear being judged for what I say, but omg for me that deafening silence is so much worse because of anxiety.  Also, your T is not mad at you.  I’ve trained myself to stop saying that (mostly, like maybe 99% of the time).  It doesn’t help even if they reassure me because I don’t emotionally believe them anyway, even if I know rationally that they’re telling me the truth.  

Also, you’re not alone in this.  This experience is common and you’re likely not the only client of your therapist that has this problem.

I think in saying “Why, is it not true?” your therapist is gently reminding you to speak your truth, that it’s ok to say what you think and feel.  It’s not about the little details of what might or might not have happened.  It’s about how it all affected you, and how it affects you to this day, making you want to deny, minimize, question, or numb out your own thoughts and feelings.

Again, why shouldn’t you care...?"

He texted back with “I’m still online for your session.  I implore you to discuss this.”  It’s the first time he’s ever texted me.  I didn’t see it until after the session ended, and I’ve had another session since (we meet 2x/week).  But since then, like an idiot I keep taking out my phone and looking at it.  Because it’s something of him that’s tangible that stays.  It reminds me that he exists, outside of when I see him in session.  It’s only two sentences.  But he said “I’m still here”.  That means so much.  It makes me feel like he’s going to stay, that he’s not going to disappear or leave me.  Ugh, I’m so stupid.  And he said “I implore you...”  That’s different, not like the usual “I would encourage you to bring this up next time” kind of thing that therapists will say.  If he’s “imploring” me, that has some feeling behind it, like it means that he cares.

I know that emotional dysregulation is something I have to work on (I have bpd) but I hesitated writing out the word “dissociated” because I don’t feel right saying that, it gives out the wrong connotations, just like the words “abuse” or “trauma”, although I also know my discomfort also means something too.

My therapist doesn’t ever work on any tools with me because he’s not doing CBT, and also because he knows I’ve done intensive DBT in the past and I should already have those skills.  I’ve asked him why he doesn’t ever try to help me with grounding when I get distressed...  Actually, no, I’ve never asked him directly, I’ve only complained to him that he doesn’t help me.

He says that’s not the issue, that I don’t have to agree with his conjectures.  As long as I consider what he says and bring up my own alternative ideas/thoughts for exploration.  Does your therapist think he’s always right to the exclusion of your own viewpoints?  Or are you just saying “no, you’re wrong” without offering other avenues for exploration?

I’ve been in therapy 2x/week for 17 months now, and I’ve given him a LOT of grief for this.  At this point he knows that relating distant details of my life to my therapeutic relationship with him “in the room” is likely to elicit annoyance and sarcasm from me, and yet he continues to do so.  I’ve come to believe that he continues to take the risk because it’s kind of his job and he feels it’s important to do so?

Also, as you said, she is about to go on leave, so it makes sense that there will be some abandonment fears kicking around.  

It can also be shame too.  Because you’re “needing” things from her and perhaps you feel less deserving because you’re “just a client” and not one of those “more important” front line workers.  To be honest, I don’t think that she values you less than them.  I think she just got frazzled and was not careful about how she came across.  It’s not your fault for wanting your therapist to be there for you.  You are not less deserving than anyone else.

I know it doesn’t feel like it but it’s actually a GOOD thing that these kinds of feelings are getting stirred up.  It means therapy is working.  At least that’s what I’ve been told.  Therapy is a unique opportunity to be curious about yourself and about these kinds of reactions you have, and to explore their underpinnings.  You do this in collaboration with your therapist because unlike other relationships, she is a safe person to do this with because she exists solely to help you.  This is all easier said than done.

TalkTherapy,fl57olp,t3_fmk5in,1584830374.0,"My personal opinion is to keep processing this with your new therapist, including everything you wrote here.  I’m afraid that seeing your old therapist won’t give you the kind of closure that you long and hope for.  We are all biased to our own versions of reality.  So what if she gives you her version wherein she justifies the actions that hurt you without acknowledging her responsibility and her part in it?  How would that be helpful?  Would it not further convince you that everything is your fault?  You already know that “reality” is likely somewhere in the middle.  And you even know that knowing what is 100% real matters less than how it affected you.  I struggle with this myself (and coincidentally just fired off an email to my therapist about it moments before I read your post).  All I can say is if you have any kind of trust/hope in your current therapist, please keep working through this with them.  It’s not unimportant at all.

Edit to address your TLDR:    
a) “I will mis-remember the events of our experience forever and not be able to properly heal from them.”  I think you can properly heal even without having perfect memory of events.  If that were not true then none of us would ever heal from childhood trauma.  You say that she helped you too.  Over time your memory would just incorporate both the positive and negative experiences to present a fuller picture of *your experience.*    
b) “I will always have that small part of me that hurts myself about it because of the lack of closure.”  This one is harder because it will take time.  Closure is one of those things that everyone talks about as important, but it’s not always necessary nor is the attempt to obtain closure from the other person always beneficial.  Not all relationships that end will have proper closure and that’s ok.  You’ll achieve it in your own mind for yourself over time.  I truly believe that."

I said, “This is weird.”  And he said, “Yeah, it is, but let’s try it out and see how it goes.”  It was kind of reassuring to me that I could tell he was a little out of his element too, although he’d already had a few sessions before me."
TalkTherapy,fktqqtj,t1_fkshhl6,1584531446.0,"Oh no!  I’m sorry this happened.  You may feel guilty but please try to recognize that it’s not your fault.  It’s a miscommunication, your school fought for you, and it really sounds like the agency made a bad decision.  There isn’t anything you can do at this point except to try to take care of yourself.  I don’t know what the agency will tell your clients (if anything since they are the ones who terminated your placement) but I think and hope that your clients know you well enough to know that you wouldn’t leave so suddenly if you had a choice.  You did good work with them while you were with them and that is not lost."
TalkTherapy,fktnf6n,t1_fkshel4,1584527731.0,"I think you’re right.  I do this too.  I feel the need to communicate (thoughts, feelings, reactions that don’t come up in therapy because I’m usually frozen or blank) even if he never responds."
TalkTherapy,fkrx2w4,t3_fkbf2r,1584477760.0,Don’t listen to him.  He’s got it 100% wrong.  It’s not that therapy can’t help you.  It’s that **he** is not the right therapist who can and will.
TalkTherapy,fkrvhb4,t1_fkpdno7,1584476850.0,"You’re not weird at all.  I just wrote this in my journal this morning:

“I am secretly glad that everything is canceled and I don’t have to do anything.  No gym, no drums, no plays or concerts, no going out to restaurants or hanging out with friends.  These are all good and “fun” things, but they are all so much “work” for me and I’m glad I don’t have to force myself to do them anymore.  I now have an excuse to stay home.”"
TalkTherapy,fkrv86g,t1_fkpie4j,1584476703.0,Was it a good session?
