i have a fascination with both timekeeping and old soviet technology so ive always wanted one of these.

how much heat do they produce, would i be able to display one on a shallow enclosed shelf or would it be better in an open area?

what sort of timekeeping equipment or software do they use?"
depression,foe85e4,t1_foe77cy,1587697980.0,"
there are a few things that i do that help me, take from them what you will, but remember that these arent instructions to follow to the tee, merely experiences passed on from one bleeding soul onto another.

1. i can control this. i repeat these words to myself when im depressed to remind myself that these feelings of agony... are mostly from me and to me. i can own my depression and these feelings are temporary, these memories are in the past, and these circumstances that im imaging are mostly fiction.

2. acceptance. whatever the sources of my depression is, be it trama, stress, sadness, chemical imballances, injury, genetics, whatever, it is what it is. so now i just need to work on making it better.

3. support. therapy, friends, family, girlfriend, all of these have helped me a lot. just remember that they cant fix this for you, you have to do the leg work, and its hard, but with practice it gets easier, but youve got to do it every day."

this reminds me of that moment."

he had picked me up in his old work truck with a broken exhaust and on the drive home i remember the tone and drone of it had a direct effect on my vision. the vibrations and clatter were changing my vision from bright to dark 3 dimensional to 2 dimensional. cartoon to hyper realism. i saw a motherfucking smiling unicorn in the sky over the liquid mountain range that was the road and the houses along the way. 

i began to understand that something wasnt right. but i also understood that this was nobodys fault and that if i fought what i was experiencing that it would win and it would drag me deeper.

11th ave in my home town.

i got home, my dad, noticeably in a panic, asked if i wanted to watch tv. i was grounded so this would not have been aloud. more evidence that something wasnt right. was i going to die from this sickness? i was afraid of death but i told myself if i had any control of my death i would make it comfortable. i said no to the tv, went to my room and as soon as my head touched my pillow it was 12 hours later. i awoke feeling normal but the world had turned grey. not a dark grey but more the kind of grey that you may find painted on the walls of a library. comfortable grey that has the temperature and the hardness that only really appreciated by someone experiencing a hangover from hell.

that kid got expelled and a mass letter was sent to every parent in the district.

so anyway, idk, this story is plausible to me, change out water for tea or something and its entirely possible."

we'll see if it works."
